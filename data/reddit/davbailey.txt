My friend talked to the guy, he said $12/hr

They have a $30/month option as well, that might be what you meant.  This option would only be worth it if they are charging &gt;$3000/month though.

That must be one large seat...
Sorry, couldn't resist.

It frightens me, as I'm sure it's frightening every Bitcoiner in Canada, that the gov't is talking about regulating Bitcoin to this extent.  If Bitcoin scares them so much, then they should try to control it through regulation instead of driving it underground.  All this does essentially is punish the people who use it for legitimate purposes, it won't stop criminals being able to use it to bring money into the country and trade it for cash.  
People can also start contacting their local MLAs.  This is a strategy for protest that I learned from working as a union rep for the last few years.  You can email them (but physical typed and mailed letters have a better chance of being read), or phone their office and request a meeting.  Tell them what your issue is, make it personal (bank closed my small business account, ruined business, can't feed my kids), tell them what they can do (even simply sharing the messages about the harm this can cause or the benefits to Canada if they embrace it), be nice so you can build a relationship, and tell them you will follow up later. If you don't hear anything, keep trying! 
The more people who hear the real message of Bitcoin (especially elected officials), and the more noise we can make, the further up the chain of command we can reach, we just need to spread the word and get people involved.

It's Robocoin.  He said it cost 23.8 BTC, and the price of a Robocoin is $18500 (Bitstamp and CaVirtex were both at $777/BTC yesterday).

Happened around the end of July, all 3 of their locations. We had a Bitcoin Meet-up there 2 weeks ago and CBC did some filming as well.
Here's info for the next Meet-up 
Come out and meet your fellow local Bitcoiners!

I was also in this boat, requested a wire transfer on Aug 26.  I just sent MtGOX a cancel request at 9:45, and by 10:10, the money was back in my account!  At least their customer service is fast...

Expedia for sure.  
I think Bitcoin has great potential for the travel industry.  Imagine the convenience of travelling to several different countries on business, you buy your flights with Bitcoin, then arrive in each new country and walk up to the Bitcoin ATM and trade Bitcoin for local currency.  When you leave, you sell back your leftover currency and board your plane.

They accept Bitcoin using a tablet and Blockchain app.  
If you go to the Whyte ave or Jasper ave locations, the servers aren't very good at using the app, so make sure they switch units from BTC to CAD, they tried to charge me 9 BTC instead of $9.
