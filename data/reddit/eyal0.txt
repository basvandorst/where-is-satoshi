But what's the advantage in that?
Edit: Nevermind, I get it.  The point is to publish only power-of-two transactions so that it's impossible for someone to duplicate a single transaction, which would lead to a "fork" and potentially slow down the acceptance of that block.
I say "fork" because the two transactions would both give the reward to the same person.  It's not too big a deal.

Even if you use a weak passphrase, that doesn't mean that you used a weak key.  For example, with the original bitcoin-qt client, the passphrase is what unlocks the really strong key.

In the recent problem, it *was* a recognized extension.
The problem is that we use products that ask us questions that we can't answer:  "This extension requires access to all websites, do you want to install it?"  We're so used to seeing these that we just click yes because we want to get on with our day and not be pestered.
Google play and iTunes are trying to help us by policing the store.  There's more work to be done.  For example, Chrome extensions never tell you why they require a permission.  Many authors have gone to the trouble of writing it into the description of their product, which is a good start.
Another way is to limit a programs access via trusted programs.  For example, many apps require broad network access to display ads.  I'd feel more comfortable installing "Apple ad network extension" or whatever on my iPhone and then have the app require and interface with that.
Also, we need heuristics to detect suspicious behaviour.  For example, my browser could report to Google every time a Chrome extension accessed a webpage.  Then when you install the extension, it might say: "This extension needs access to the sites you browse (90% of the time it is modifying your input on site blahblah.bitcoin.com)."
Google Play and iTunes should *want* to provide these services, I believe, because it will increase faith in the downloads and that leads to more paying customers.

That's a one time fee for long-term storage. It would be better if the fee were over time, too.
You could make a scheme where some of the value of your bitcoins is distributed to miners over time. That would compensate them for keeping you in the database. I doubt that it would be popular.

The follow-up says that it will take months until his money really returns and the government is fighting the interest and lawyer fees.
Instead, the government should be paying extra to make up for the wrongful arrest! Not the owner that was arrested, it was his money that was arrested. (Recall, the money is the defendant in civil forfeiture, not he!)
If he can show that the money was wrongfully charged, maybe he's got a case?
We've got a system where, if the police get it right, they make money and when they get it wrong, no penalty, they just give it back and try elsewhere.

Ignorance is different from unintentional. For example, you can know that it is against the law to kill someone yet still do it on accident. It can be the difference between manslaughter and murder.
The banking law should have required that the police prove intent: That he did it on purpose to further another crime. Similar to conspiracy. Conspiracy isn't a crime unless it's in order to further a crime. Conspiring to buy a pizza isn't conspiracy.
If the police had something real to go on, they would have arrested him. Instead, they went for civil forfeiture because they couldn't get something real to stick. And they'll fight having to pay fees for their fuckup because if they did then everyone would expect to get reimbursed when they get robbed.

This is a good point.  Being secure increases the value of BTC but being unusable decreases the value.  I think that being usable is more important than being secure.  For example, credit cards are highly usable and not so secure and they're very popular.  Encrypting your computer is more secure but not so usable and it's not popular.

This scheme doesn't work because there is nothing to stop him from submitting that very first transaction, even after using your services. That's why multisig is needed, so that you can be the one to pick the transaction that pays you.
And the time lock is needed so that, if you don't refund him at all, he can get all his money back.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:28:00
It's possible to modify the fee after it's sent by respending it, if the miners can figure out to ditch the old transaction for the new one. That make double spending easier, however.
Another option is to spend the result of the first transaction with a fee. Miner software would be incentivized to push the first transaction through in order to push the second transaction.

Imagine that you want to use internet at a cafe and pay by the minute.
Also, know that there are multisig wallets that require two people to agree on all actions. In this case, you and the cafe.
Also, there are time-locked transactions that aren't valid until a certain time.
First, you make a 100BTC transfer into the multisig account. And then you and the cafe sign a transaction to give all the money back to you, time-locked for 24 hours. (But see below)
If you walk out of the cafe right there, the money will eventually return to you in 24 hours.
Instead of walking out, you make a transaction that returns just 99BTC to yourself from the multisig wallet and give the rest to the cafe. You sign it. The cafe signs it because this means that they'll get 1BTC, but they aren't going to submit it to the network yet. And now they allow you to use the internet for a while. Let's say that 1BTC is worth ten minutes.
After ten minutes, they shut off the internet. If you go home, they'll submit that transaction and get 1BTC and you'll get 99 back. They have to submit it before the time lock or else you'll submit that one and get yourself back the whole 100.
Say you want to use more internet. Make a new transaction with a 98-2 split and sign it. They'll give you another ten minutes. Now you go home.
Notice that only the first multisig and the final transaction needed to get sent. 99-1 didn't get sent. It'll always be just the first one and the last one so that you can pay for stuff by the minute without having to do a bunch of small transactions.
In reality, it wouldn't be 100BTC, it would .01BTC. I just wanted to keep the math simple. Also, you wouldn't work in ten minute increments, you could get it down to the second.
Also, that first transaction into the multisig wallet would go in reverse. *First* the transaction that gives you back the money is signed. *Then* you put it in the multisig. That way the cafe owner can't decide to screw you and lock up your money forever.

Orphan blocks can't be prevented.  They're a function of how long the time between blocks is.  If you decrease the time between blocks, you make the problem worse.  If you add more nodes to the network, it also gets worse.  But if you improve the network, it should get better.
That's just 1 year of data, unforunately.  If we saw that the number of orphans per day went down, could we decrease the block time?

First make a transaction that sends the entirety of a BTC address to a new address that you already own.
Now the old address is cleared out of BTC and contains only BCH.  Import that old private key into a BCH wallet like Electron Cash or whatever.  If the client is bogus, at worst, you've lost just the BCH.  You won't lose BTC because the address is already empty as far as BTC is concerned, right?

When businesses fail, often it's because the economy is in recession. In that case, the business owner fires his employees, closed up shop, and tries to recoup his money.
To say that only the business owner took a risk is to ignore all the employees now out of a job and looking for work where there is none. Those employees haven't no savings because they were probably exploited by the boss. Meanwhile, the boss will weather the downturn with all the money he made while the going was good.

First, with investing, you can lose money.  A job at McDonalds might not pay much but it doesn't ever lose.  (The argument against this is that you are investing your time and risking it against whatever else you could have done with that time.)
Second, we need investment to encourage job creation.  That's kind of true and it's why the interest rates get moved around.  But you could argue that the lower capital gains serve the wealthy and we could create a system that encourages investment without giving the benefit only to the wealthy.

Your machine holds the wallet which contains the keys to unlock the BTC in the transaction but the transaction is on the network.  So if you get money while you're not online it's like someone sliding cash under the door to your house when you're not home: Only you can get at the money with your keys.
Each block **doesn't** have a list of the transactions of the last 10 minutes, it just has a **hash** of the list of the transactions of the last 10 minutes.  No matter how many transactions, the hash is just 32 bytes.  So the block itself is really small, just 80 bytes per 10 minutes, about 4MB per year.  Really small.
To prove that a transaction happenned you just need the transactions that were part of that same block.  In fact, you don't even need all of those because the hash uses a hash tree (Markle tree).
And finally, once a transaction sends money to someone, you don't need to store all the history.  The fact that there's a transaction verified by a block that shows that you've received the money *and* no later transaction showing that you already gave the money to someone else is enough.  The history of the bitcoins before their latest transaction can be deleted.

You write that BIP101 would favor miners with good network connections. Why is that bad? Don't I want to encourage miners to have good network connections? Most people work in mining pools anyway so they don't need to send the block with all the transactions, just the mining bonus and the solution. Let the mining pool operator put it together into a big block and send all the transactions.
This solution feels more like a temporary patch, not a solution that scales. We need to solve the problem of requiring the ledger to be on all computers everywhere, instantly. Banks solve this by maintaining only their own ledgers, without storing every bank's. That would be a scalable solution. Not sure how to make it work with bitcoin.

I like the freedom that this provides and I'd you're a libertarian it sounds awesome, but I think that it will be dangerous for individual investors. The supply of VC money is greater than the demand which is why it's so easy to fund a business now. Coupled with the low interest rates, everyone is already investing in businesses. With so much investment money out there, it's hard to make sure that yours is the money that lands on a winner.
Investors with less than 100k aren't going to have the savvy to pick winners and they're going to lose their shirts.
It's unfair because back when being a VC was such a winner, we didn't let most people in. Now that it's a losing game, we let in hoi polloi? This will lead to the rich gambling with the money of the middle class.
More of the same, I suppose.

The dollar sign was originally a very skinny U written on an S, standing for United States. The connection at the bottom eventually wore off and left us with an S with two vertical lines and I think that most people over forty remember drawing it that way. Somewhere in the last decade or three the two lines became just one, maybe because it was easier to draw on a computer screen.

At 60,000 transactions per day, that's 2.16USD per transaction.  Not as high as $11 but more than just cents.

I'd argue that it *can't* replace fiat currency.  Fiat currency is actually just debt: You pay it to the government as taxes and in return the government does stuff for you (maintaining streets and a military, etc).  As the value of what the government can provide changes, so must the value of fiat currency.  And each government provides different services, so you can't tie all the governments together.  The euro tried this and it's failing.

Cloud storage is so simple... I don't see the need for a brain wallet anymore.  I can store my wallet's key, 160bits of entropy, online in a dozen places.  Far stronger than I can memorize.  And that file, I can encrypt with my 44bits of entropy using a KBDF to stretch the key to 1 second of computation.  That seems safer than 128 bits.
In fact, from everything that we've seen on the internet, a 6-digit OTP is *stronger* than a really good password which can be hacked remotely.  So the comparison is really:
44bits plus access to the encrypted wallet file
128bits but no file needed
I'd argue that the former is stronger.  I think that that's how blockchain.info works, by the way.

With escrow, it could be done.  For example, if I have coins at mtgox and you have a mtgox address, I can transfer them to you with zero confirmations, because mtgox doesn't reverse charges and I don't have the keys to their addresses.  It's not decentralized but it's trivial.

ECDSA and RSA depend on the the discrete logarithm problem and integer factorization, both of which are similar so if you break one, you've probably broken the other, too.  Neither are NP-complete, but they are in NP, which just means that we don't know an easy way to do it but we can't prove that it's hard, either.
Proving that P=NP would break ECC.  Bitcoins would be the least of our concerns.

NxT, from what I read, works differently from Bitcoin.  With bitcoin, the number of coins increases over time, slowing and stopping at 21million.
With NxT, they start with all the coins and over time the number of coins decreases.  There is no block reward, only transaction fees.
From what I read, 73 people started with all the coins and they paid 21BTC to be in the group of 73 people.
Edit: Actually, it was 71 people.  NxtCoin is now worth 0.00006 BTC so the original investors have made 2500x on their money in about 1 month.  I would have liked to be one of those 71!  Assuming that they split it evenly and the price holds, each of them has 60,000BTC.  So, 36 million dollars in 1 month, just for being on the forum.  Very, very fortunate people.

Here's a solution that **actually makes sense**:
"Satoshi" has 59 machines mining.  To make sure that none of them accidentally repeated work, each one was given a different machine_id to put in the LSB: 0,1,2,3...58.  Machines 10 through 18 broke down and he didn't bother to recycle the LSBs.
    current_nonce = machine_id
    while True:
      result = hash(block, current_none)
      if result &lt; target:
        break
      current_nonce += 256
Ta-da!  Solution.  It makes sense that you'd put the machine_id in the LSB and not the MSB because it's easier to detect that you've wrapped around: Just check for `current_nonce == machine_id`.  Otherwise you'd have to test for `current_nonce &gt;&gt; 56 != machine_id`, which is marginally slower.
Mystery solved!

Not only might that impossible, it might be that proving P equal-or-not-equal to NP is impossible.  Godel showed that there can be statements that can be true and yet not be provable.  So it's possible that P really is not equal to NP but it's impossible to prove.
That's only the case if our system for proving is consistent.  Proving that the system is consistent is also not possible.

Converting a checksum to a bitcoin address isn't trivial.

I think so.  The bitcoin blockchain is essentially one long list of text with rules about what you can add to it (like rules against double-spending).  A database is the sum of all the transactions that you have performed on it, with rules about what you can add and delete.  So there's your database.
As for the front-end, you can run the whole thing locally: HTML, javascript, even the code that would normally be on the server.  The front-end you could host as a bittorrent or however you like.  Each operation would be a read or write of the database.
That's it.  Anyone can add stuff to the database.  You have a users table where each person adds himself to the table along with his public key.  In order to post an ad, you must post it with along with a matching signature, to prove that it's from you.  Same goes for buy and sell orders and for feedback, all must be signed by the users to be legit or else they break the rules and don't enter the database.
I'm not sure how to make the feedback high-quality.  How did SR do it?  For example, I could make fake accounts on SR, buy stuff from myself, and artifically jack up my feedback, right?  The same thing would be possible here, too.  It'd be nice to have a way to prevent that kind of thing.  Did SR have a way?

Addresses don't really store money, they're more like the keys to a safe that stores the money.  When you send money, what you're doing is: Unlock the safe listed in transaction A, row B, and pour the contents into a different safe, safe C.

You'd have to figure out the risk of both the upside and the downside.
The derivative pricing model is based on the underlying asset, like options and stocks.  Here's the underlying asset is maybe dollars so you'd have to buy and sell options on the BTC and offset with buy and selling BTC.  The option market for BTC/USD is probably not liquid enough for this.

Even people that don't want to switch, the bank will switch them behind the scenes because it saves the bank money.  They get the service that they're used to and the bank takes the risk and profits of using BTC.

If MtGox opens the Mayzus MoneyPolo withdrawl, that would allow people to withdraw from MtGox, transfer to OKpay, then into BTC-e, and then buy at BTC-e on the cheap for an arbitrage profit of about 10%.  At most, maybe you can do $1000/day so you'd make $100USD per day minus fees.  So, say $50 per day.
The risk would be that one of those sites goes down and take all your money with it.  The money that you'd need to run the arbitrage depends on how long it takes the money to transfer.  Say that loop takes 10 days.  So you end up with:
Upside: $50 profit per day  
Downside: Lose up to $10,000USD if one of those sites takes all your money
That's a pretty sweet return if you can swing it.  If Mtgox figures out withdrawls, I suspect that the prices will even out.
Back when MtGox worked with okpay, I was doing it for about $30/day.

The transaction reads something like: "send 1BTC from address 123 to address 456" and it includes two more things: a proof that you own address 123 and a signature on the entire message.  The requirement of a proof is what keeps others from spending your coins.  The signature is what keeps others from modifying the transaction to change the receipient or amount.
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:38:45
Another thought: it's possible to add fees after the fact.  Just make a transaction that sends part of the change from the first transaction to another account, spending all but, say, 0.001 of it.  The second transaction is only valid if the first is processed, so the second transaction is sort of paying for the first.

Agreed, but bitcoin isn't in step with the increase in value.


Okay, true.  :-)  Though banks take risks and the 4% could balance out the defaults, but, yeah, the banks are making money from the debtors!
If the world used cryptocoins, banks wouldn't be able to charge those rates.  Right now, if you have a million bucks, you have to store it in a bank.  You can't really keep it in your home safely.  And the government gives banks the right to loan out more money than they have, legally.  Banks invent money.  They are the ones with the privledge and they use that power over us to take money from us as loan fees.
Government invented inflation, which I'm not per-se against, but they gave all that money to the bankers.  That, I'm against.  If it were spread fairly, that would alright.  I don't know how to do that.

**tl;dr You need more than 30%.**
I think that it's much worse than that.  I tried a Poisson distribution but I'm not very good at the math so instead I wrote some code to simulate the situation.
Assume that you have 30% of the network hashrate.  That means that at every moment, your odds of finding a block are 0.3 in total_network_rate.  The odds of the rest of the network finding a block are 0.7 in total_network_rate.
To orphan the block intentionally, you'd need to find 2 blocks before the rest of the network found 1.  We'll assume that after that, you win.
According to my simulation, the odds of success with 30% of the network are about 9.5%.  So the success would need to be worth 25/0.095, or about 263BTC.
Code below:
    
    
    import math
    import random
    
    chance_to_find_block = 1/100000.0
    chance_to_find_block_a = chance_to_find_block*0.3
    chance_to_find_block_b = chance_to_find_block*0.7
    
    results = []
    
    a_wins = 0
    b_wins = 0
    for i in xrange(1000):
      blocks_found_by_a = 0
      blocks_found_by_b = 0
      while blocks_found_by_a &lt; 2 and blocks_found_by_b &lt; 1:
        if random.random() &lt; chance_to_find_block_a:
          blocks_found_by_a += 1
        if random.random() &lt; chance_to_find_block_b:
          blocks_found_by_b += 1
      if blocks_found_by_a &gt;= 2:
        a_wins += 1
      else:
        b_wins += 1
    print (a_wins, b_wins)

You're joking, right??!
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:37:29
Hmm.  Let me try it again:
Assume that the team with 70% hashing power found the fees, so it's in their interest to make that chain longer.  The other team, with 30%, can either try to steal the fees or not, and they do that by attempting to orphan the block.  To keep it simple, we'll assume that if Team30 can find 2 blocks before Team70 can find 1, they'll succeed in stealing the fees and Team70 won't try to steal them back.
Finds first block|Finds second block|odds|try to steal|don't try to steal|comment
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Team70|Team70|0.7\*0.7|Earn 0|Earn 0|didn't find any blocks, moot
Team70|Team30|0.7\*0.3|Earn 25|Earn 25| gave up after first block, moot
Team30|Team70|0.3\*0.7|Earn 0|Earn 25| stolen block orphaned, wasted effort
Team30|Team30|0.3\*0.3|Earn 50+fees|Earn 50| steal success
Equating the two sides reduces to:
    0.3\*fees = 0.7\*25
So the fee needs to be 58.3BTC or more for this attack to be worthwhile.  For this transaction, with a fee of 81, to steal with positive expectation, you'd need x hashing power:
    x*81=(1-x)*25
23.6% of the network's hashing power would have sufficed to make it worthwhile to try to steal the fee.  BTCGuild, at 31%, is the only mining pool that could do it.  However, they are the ones that got the fee in the first place, so it wasn't worthwhile for anyone.

1. I don't think that any government would start accepting bitcoins as payment for taxes.  Fiat currency from governments is just an IOU for services from the government.  The government isn't going to put itself into a situation where it can't control the prices of the services it provides.
2. The world spent a lot more time on deflationary currency (gold, etc) than off it (fiat) and things progressed back then.

I don't know if you need a separate blockchain per database or if one would suffice.  Here are somethings to think about, however:
A database has rules.  For example, an order's BuyerID and SellerID have to match a UserID in the User table.  BTC also has rules about what transactions are valid.  I don't know if it's possible to make a website that is based on a NoSQL database that has zero rules.  Could you make a front-end that figures out how to handle a database that anyone can deface?  If rules are needed and different for each website, then you'd need multiple blockchains.
Also, the database might get very big.  Dividing it up, maybe using hash trees, would let people download just portions of it.  So that's another reason why you might want to split it up.
You might not need to reward people to host the data.  For example, images from a seller could be a magnet link that downloads  a torrent.  People host torrents today without compensation.  The reward is having a copy of the data.  Compensation is only needed for miners expending GPU cycles for the critical transactions that have to be processed in order.

I like the idea of Visa stepping in and playing escrow and dispute solver, for the same reason that I use Visa when I buy stuff online and I don't, say, hand over cash.  People will pay for this service, as they do already.
I don't know how to do 1+1_of_m but n_of_m is a known, solved problem.  (Draw a function of x with degree n-1 on a graph and give each player one of the coordinates 1...m.  The secret key is the y-intercept.)  I'm sure something similar and efficient could be found.

Yup.  Block ID is preferred over timestamp because of the timezone issues.  All client will agree on block height.
With this, you could make coins that are only spendable by one person until a certain date and then spendable by some other person.  I don't know if this is a feature or a drawback.
The change is backwards compatible, just add a "push block ID" instruction into the script.  It wouldn't affect anyone until someone started using it.  Perhaps have a new version with clients/miners that support it but only from block ID X onward, so that everyone gets the feature at the same time.

That also partially explains the spread on btc-e.  In btc-e's case, however, it's difficult to put money in *and* take it out, so why would btc-e be less and not more?
My theory: But btc-e supports more cryptocoins, so people are buying BTC at one site and selling them at btc-e in order to buy other coins.  This is downward pressure on the BTC at btc-e.  The spread is limited by the arbitrage, which is possible only if you want to jump through the OKPay hoops and those fees limit the spread.

The article did a good job of it but I'll try again.  Lamport:
First, I generate 320 random numbers.  I'll call them:
    rand_0_000, rand_1_000
    rand_0_001, rand_1_001
    rand_0_002, rand_1_002
    rand_0_003, rand_1_003
    ...
    rand_0_156, rand_1_156
    rand_0_157, rand_1_157
    rand_0_158, rand_1_158
    rand_0_159, rand_1_159
Just random numbers.  Okay, now I hash them all:
    hash_0_000, hash_1_000
    hash_0_001, hash_1_001
    hash_0_002, hash_1_002
    hash_0_003, hash_1_003
    ...
    hash_0_156, hash_1_156
    hash_0_157, hash_1_157
    hash_0_158, hash_1_158
    hash_0_159, hash_1_159
Those 320 numbers, that's my public key.  I send it to everyone.  Or in this case, I put on the block chain: "10 bitcoins belongs to the guy that can prove that he has the reverse of these hashes: hash_0_000, hash_1_000..."  Reversing even one hash is considered to be very difficult so my money is quite safe.
Okay, now I want to send the coins to fried_dough.  I write this message: "Give 10 bitcoins to fried_dough".  Then I hash that string and the output of that is 160bits.  Imagine that the first four bits of the hash of that message are 0,1,1,0 then I'm going to provide the appropriate random numbers corresponding to the bits in the hash:
    rand_0_000,
              , rand_1_001
              , rand_1_002
    rand_0_003,
    ...
So I send to the miners: 
    "Give 10 bitcoins to friend_dough"
    "The hash of the previous sentence is: 0,1,1,0,..."
    "The random numbers are &lt;rand_0_000&gt;, &lt;rand_1_001&gt;, &lt;rand_1_002&gt;, &lt;rand_0_003&gt;, ..."
Now, say some shady miner wants to steal the bitcoins.  Instead of publishing my message, he changes the first sentence to:
    "Give 10 bitcoins to miner_thief"
But now the hash has changed, so, the second line has to read:
    "The hash of the previous sentence is: 1,1,0,0,..." (notice the different bits)
And now the third line has to include rand_1_000, which the thief doesn't know.  On average, there will be 80 random numbers that the thief doesn't have, so he's stuck breaking a hashes.
The scenario today, however, is:
    "Give 10 bitcoins to friend_dough"
    "The public key is &lt;my public key&gt; and my proof that I own that public key is &lt;proof&gt;"
In this case, the miner needs to try to figure out the private key given a public key so that he can change the message to "give to miner_thief".  That means breaking elliptic curve cryptography, not hashes.  Also really difficult.
With a classical computer (like every computer in the world today), both of those are similarly difficult: practically impossible.  But with a quantum computer, breaking ECC gets much easier while breaking hashes only gets somewhat easier.  That's because quantum computers make breaking ECC a polynomial-time task, down from exponential.  Breaking Lamport, however, remains exponential (but smaller exponential).
Don't panic just yet, making quantum computers is really hard.  Unlike classical computers, where you double their size and they get twice as powerful, quantum computers get exponetially more difficult to make, like how much sand that you need to add height to a pyramid.

Given that he had 50 machines, the difficulty and the blockrate, you can figure out how fast each machine was.  The "Satoshi" coinbases 0-9 have an average of 293 blocks found.  10-18 have an average of about 3.  Because the "Satoshi" coinbases include all the other miners, the ratio of Satoshi to non-Satoshi miners at the time was 290*50:3*256, or 14500:768, or about 18.9:1.
During that time, the difficulty started at 1 and rose to 1.34, so more or less constant difficulty 1 the whole time.  Block 36288 was found 2010-01-25 13:07:59, block 0 was found 2009-01-03 18:15:05.  That's 1 year and 22 days.  (36288 is way less than 1block/10minutes, which should have been 55762.  In the beginning, the difficulty was so low that it defaulted to the minimum of 1.)
36288 blocks at difficulty 1 require about 0x100000000 * 36288 hashes, which is 1.5585577e+14 total hashes in 1 year and 22 days.  That's 4658289.39 hashes/second for the whole network.  Satoshi was 18.9/19.9 of that, so Satoshi was 4424204.5 hashes/second.  That's just over 4million hashes/second.  Puny for 1 2009-era computer, let alone 50 of 'em!
So my new theory is that maybe he didn't have 50 machines, but instead just 1 or two machines.  Every time he updated his mining code, he changed the default lsb.  So it wasn't `machine_id`, it was `version_id`.  One way to prove this would be a scatter plot of "Satoshi LSB" versus block height.  I'd expect that the LSBs are grouped by time, probably increasing over time.  There would be a little noise in the plot from non-Satoshi miners, but just 1 in 19.9 dots.
Does someone want to whip up this plot?  Scrape the nonces using some bitcoin library and plot nonce_LSB versus block_height.

You can't change the block height.  When a miner mines a block, the block height is known.  But he has a lot more flexibility with the block's timestamp.  He can set that ahead or behind, no problem.  Can't fake the block height.  He wouldn't ohld on to it, he would just publish it but with a time in the past.
Also, while mining, the transaction list would change because what was valid at one time became invalid at another time.  Using block height, it can only change after a block is published and he needs to recollect transactions in that case anyway.


No, because the amount is not part of the script.  The amount is a separate field.  It would be difficult for miners to even recognize that the script had this going on.
Let the client watch how long it takes to verify a transaction and the client can just push new transactions with fees as needed.  Easier and automatic.
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:22:50
He probably means that he transfers them out of the private keys and into his own public keys.  But in that case, you could just send him the raw transaction and it would be just as good.

If the government has the private keys, there is nothing you can do, true.  But SR could have protected the money by storing it off the server.  In fact, this is probably what SR did because the Feds got *only* 26,000BTC, just 2-3 times the daily volume of SR.  The Feds robbed the register but they didn't get into the safe.
The transaction is set for a month in advance and SR themselves would invalid it before the month is up so there's no pranking to be done.  Unless a website is captured, the contract is never worth anything.

1. Regarding exploits: Just as the nodes come to agreement on the blockchain, so do the miners.  So long as 51+% of them are downloading the latest version of the miner, that's the way changes will be made.  I'm seeing good decisions being made.  The ability to handle past exploits it actually a good sign.
2. See above.
3. Governments have been too slow to act.  If funds are moving in, by the time the government acts, the money will already be in bitcoins.  Like how by the time the government started outlawing drugs, they were already everywhere.  That was a law against the drug-users, though.  A law against the money-holders, that won't pass so easily!  Look at how the rich basically control the government today.  If the money is in bitcoins, it'll be hard for the government to pass laws against it.
4. Possible.  I think that they won't realize the threat until it's too late because these aren't companies that act fast.  They've gotten too comfortable.  It's already too late for them to sabotage with computing power.  By the time they think to sabotage with instability, bitcoin might be too expensive to sway, even for them.
5. It's not really a flaw because the miners are compensating by fixing the max size of a block.  This means that the miners will choose which transactions to include and they'll choose whatever gives them the best fee per byte.  It's helping transition us into a model where miners are making fees without rewards!  It's actually a good thing!  
But you make good points.  It's going to be an interesting ride!
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:56:00
But maybe mining power can be swapped with other things?
Mining is basically a way to get the majority to agree on the ledger.  You give each citizen in a country a private key and instead of using CPU power, you count how many "miners" (citizens) have signed a "transaction" (proposal) and &gt;50% means a block is made.  Now you've created a high-speed voting system on proposals.
Or put that into a data center and now many computers can rapidly vote on which computer is the master.  A master election algorithm, important in large networks.
Also, right now, bitcoin has provided us with a free, distributed, timestamping mechanism.  If I add text into a transaction, I can later prove when I wrote it because it's in the secure transaction blocks.  It's like a notary signing "This document was signed on so-and-so date." for free.
Anywhere we need a secure, public log that nodes can vote on and is impossible to forge, this technology is useful.

Not sure about blockchain app, but your easiest method will be:
1. Lookup the transaction in blockchain.info.  It should be unconfirmed.
2. Export the private keys of all the inputs in that transaction.
3. Import all those private keys into bitcoin-qt, the official bitcoin client.
4. Now send a new transaction.
Be careful when doing this.  You want to make sure that the two transactions have overlapping inputs.  That way, only one of them will get accepted.
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:29:46
(In case you're being serious...)
A simple hash function might work like this:
Take the input as a series of bits.  Now create an output where each bit of the output is a function of a few of the input bits.  For example, you might use a lookup table that maps the first four bits (16 possible combinations) to 0 or 1.  There could be a different table for each set of four bits.  When you're finished, you've got your first output.  To make the hash strong, you might next permute the bits and do it again.
Hashes are hard to reverse because you're trying to find an input that satistifes all the outputs.  This is the boolean satisfiability problem.  It's NP-complete.

But a miner can fudge a timestamp.  He could mine a block at 02:00 but put 01:00 in the timestamp.  And transactions don't have timestamps, only blocks have timestamps.  Might as well just use the block number.  It's close enough to a timestamp.


First of all, one you have a "push timestamp" command in the scrypting language, you can do a lot of things.  One of them being using different outputs for different times.  But you can't alter the amount of the outputs, only to whom.  You could only change who can redeem, not the amounts nor the fee.


Interesting, though I don't know how to do it.  I'd like to start with putting timestamp or block IDs into the scripts and go from there.

I, too, was an engineer during the dot-com bubble.  At the peak, I was a 20-second phone call away from having $300,000 in my bank account... at 22 years old!  Instead, I rode it into the ground.  I know a guy that was waiting for his options to hit 10 million but he crashed down to 2 million (FWP).
So I invented my **investing rule**.  All you have to do it figure out **two numbers**:
1. *How big does your win have to be for it to be significant to you?*  If you're in college, maybe $2,000USD sounds big.  In your thirties with a good job, maybe $100,000 is going to change your life.
2. How much money do you want to have invested?  Maybe you can risk just $500?  Maybe you're okay with investing $50,000.
Write it down and **commit** to it.
Every few days, check out how much your entire investment is worth.  If you can sell enough to get  and still have  left over in the investment, you sell.  This way you stay invested as much as you wanted and when you do sell, it's going to be a windfall.
It might not be the best investment advice but psychologically it helps you pull the trigger when you need to sell because, as all traders know, selling is harder than buying.

Here's what the future needs to look like:
A wallet that runs on your smartphone using near-field communication or QR codes to make payment.  Just scan or tap the payment point and your phone displays:
    Pay 0.56BTC to "Wal-Mart 34th St NYC"?
    Enter PIN: ____
This would be the equivalent of cash.  If someone steals your phone and guesses your PIN, you're fucked.  You only keep a weeks worth of cash on your phone so it's no worse than having your wallet or phone stolen.  And if they don't get the PIN, even your cash is safe because the file is in your dropbox and you can access that wallet from any computer and transfer it back into your onilne wallet.
To re-charge your phone wallet, you log on to your online wallet (your bank) from phone or computer and "withdraw cash", which just puts it into your smartphone wallet.  The password for that is much stronger than just the PIN, maybe needing a yubikey.  This replaces the bank's ATM.  But instead of fees, the bank will be paying you interest because it is loaning out your bitcoins.  Still then, you've got a max withdrawl to keep thieves at bay.  You might have to walk to a branch to pass the limit.
For people that want more security when buying online, Visa and Mastercard get in on the action.  When you buy with credit, the process is the same as cash except the money goes from your account to Visa/MC.  They'll give the money to the seller at the end of the month.  If something goes screwy and charges need to be reversed, Visa will take it out of the seller and give you back your money.  Sometimes seller's will go bankrupt or disappear so Visa will take 3% on all charges, just in case.  This isn't too far off from how it works now.

Here's how you might do it:
A commerce website is basically two parts:
* A database: Storing all photos, listings, orders, user data, etc.
* A front-end: HTML, user-interface, mobile apps, etc.
So, for the front-end, you write some code.  It could run locally or be hosted.  It doesn't matter.
For the database, you basically use the same technology that bitcoin uses: a block chain.  A block chain is basically a decentralized, synchronized chain of text.  Let each transaction be a database operation.  The final state of the database is the sum of all those transactions.  Each 100th block includes, in addition to the transactions, a copy of the current state of the database, so that miners don't have to keep around block more than 100 block-times old.  (If they did keep them around, it would be equivalent to having a database entry that lasts forever!)
BTC miners protect the BTC blockchain from double-spends; database miners would protect the chain from conflicts, like deleting a line while writing to it.  Database miners mine "credits" of the database.  The mining protects the blockchain from conflicts and the "credits" that the miners get would be required payment for database operations.
To keep it simple, have it just be a key-value store, like NoSQL.  Start with an empty database.  To add to the blockchain, you spend credits that were mined, where each credit is worth, say, 1MB of data for 10 minutes (1 block-time).  The more credits that you spend, the longer that you can run your message, or have a bigger message.  Everytime a block is mined, each message's timer goes down a bit and the miner gets all those credits, plus the block reward credits that bootstrap the system like BTC has.  Miners sell those credits (for BTC or whatever) to compensate their disk space, CPU, network, etc.  The block reward goes down and eventually there are a fixed number of credits, like BTC.
Let each key-value added to the block chain can have a delete public key so that the person who added the item can delete it, too, by signing the delete request with the matching private key.  Deleting costs credits to encourage miners to include those blocks.  The delete message includes a reimburse address, which gets all the leftover credits.  The balance of all these credits is part of the current state of the database and also listed in every 100th block.  In fact, you could store those balances in the database itself!
The database's rules (like requiring that each feedback correspond to a valid user id) are handled by the client software.  Client software, for example, checks that feedback on a seller contains the signature of the buyer and that it's valid.  The client software must assume that **anyone** can write into the database, so it only relies on entries that are signed corresponding to the correct public key (buyer, seller, etc.)
So that takes take of the automated parts.  Feedback ratings, ads, orders, all covered.
How do you handle the human part?  For example, escrow?  Escrow usually means some guy that steps in and decides who gets the money.  I think that the best way to do that is to have escrower, just like you have buyers and sellers.  Escrowers are users that do the human part of the escrow, get paid a bit for their service, and get ratings on how well they did it.  This is similar to real estate, where buyer and seller can agree upon an escrow company.

Yeah, but who cares?  The date was artificial, anyway.
[Control theory]( covers how to handle situations like this.  In the case of bitcoin, the problem is that the retargeting only looks at the last 2016 blocks for the first derivative.  To prevent oscillation, you need to take the second derivative, too.  And, they could target for the absolute block number, instead of the rate.  Again, who cares?
Satoshi fucked up when he decided how to decrease rewards.  A smoother decline would have led to more stability in the system.  I can understand the goal of avoiding arithmetic with irrational numbers but he still could have done better.  For instance, halve the reward every X blocks and let the reward per block be the weighted average between the halvings so that you have straight lines between the halvings instead of stair-steps.
These problems and the inability to handle all the transactions are problems that bitcoin is stuck with.  Bummer.

Money laundering is a bullshit crime anyway.  The government made is illegal because it aids illegal activities, in the same way that a getaway car aids a bank robbery.  So why isn't driving illegal?  Things that we actually want to stop should be illegal, not every indirectly related activity that may or may not be connected.
How might the government track people using CoinJoin?  Well, if the government joined in some CoinJoins and watched the outputs, they could have an idea of which outputs are CoinJoined and then track them, assuming that everyone that used CoinJoin is a money launderer.  That would be spreading the blame far and wide, though, and I don't think that it would hold up in court on anything except money laundering.

I told mtgox to pay a fee on my behalf in a transaction and they didn't do it.  That's not right!
@_date: 2013-10-05 08:01:34
Right.  I forgot to take that into account.  27,000BTC sounds like a lot but it's really just 3 days of cash-on-hand.  Like a 7-11 that empties the cash register every night into a safe: The Feds robbed the register but didn't get into the safe.
The rest of the coins might be backed up somewhere on even in a brainwallet.  Sounds like he did it right.

Also, we'd need BTC-Mastercard that charges some percentage for escrow services.  They could arbitrate and reverse charges if needed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:37:41
No, you can still arbitrage.  Just perform the buy and the sell simultaneously.  That eliminates the risk of being long/short bitcoins but it doubles the currency that you're using to generate the arbitrage profit.  It's worthwhlie to do it that way.

Everyone here is so anti-inflation.
As counterpoint: I actually *like* inflation.  Inflation is natural: We convert worthless sand into microchips and grass into bread.  The value of everything on the planet *is* increasing and so the money supply *should* increase to match it.  Inflation also means that money is worth less over time.  So people that hoard money, the rich, have less.  And people in debt, the poor, owe less.  It's an equalizer.
I like bitcoins.  I want to be freed from the banks' fees.  And I want to be anonymous.  I don't want bankers getting rich loaning my money and then destroy the economy when they screw up.
The two sides to this issue are capitalist and libertarian.  I wish that there were room for socialism, too.

Paper wallets are usually a seed to all the addresses that the wallet will ever create, including change addresses.  So I think that he's okay.

Clearly the reason is "supply and demand".  I'd like to know why the demand has increased so suddenly.  Or the supply decreased.  What's the real-world explanation?
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:03:45
Atlantis did for Litecoin what Silkroad did for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin had first movers advantage.  We'll see what happens in the long-run.
One possibility is that we reach a point that so many people are using bitcoin that the transactions can't get processed as fast as they are made!  (We're pretty close to this today!)  You'll either have to pay bigger fees or wait hours.
So buyers and seller alike, tired of waiting hours for coin to transfer, start using litecoin or some other.  Until litecoin can't handle it and then another coin kicks in.
Eventually, each coin takes up some of the load.  No one wants to download **all** the chains, it's too much!  But some high-end servers will download multiple chains and you'll be able to exchange one currency for another, for a fee.  Like BTC-e does right now.  Or use OpenTransactions, also for a fee.  Ebay will accept multiple coins, they've got the servers for it.  Small shops will pick whichever coin works fastest and cheapest and support just that one.
Bitcoin, right now, cannot handle all the world's transactions.  Either Bitcoin changes something to make storing the entire world's ledger on your computer feasible or what I describe happens.
Another possibility is that blockchain.info stores all the ledger for you, for a fee, and you trust them to keep your money safe.  Sounds a lot like the banks that we were trying to avoid in the first place, eh?  :-)

The wealth gap is happening for a lot of reasons, mostly not inflation!  It's due to the taxes.
I wouldn't call me rich but I'm richer than most.  And somewhat a socialist.
Do you think that eliminating inflation will somehow decrease the gap?  Explain.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:36:16
You don't have to worry about BTC volatility because you can perform the buy and the sell simultaneously.  That's the smartest way to do it.
The fees, however, you have to worry about.  They are fixed so they should be easy to figure out the spread needed to profit.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:51:44
Sorry, right.  ECDSA is based on the discrete logarithm problem.  Any technique that would break one, however, would probably break the other.

Colored coins, however, provide the added feature of being able to buy them for bitcoins in a single transaction.  So, for example, say you wanted to use colored coins for shares of a company.  You could buy shares of a company (colored coins) using bitcoins in a single transaction, without the need for escrow.
In this case, however, there's no need for the colored coins because the phone is a tangible object that can't live on the blockchain.  The company could just as well publish a public key for the company and then include with the merchandise a "click this link to make yourself a certificate" with a unique link for each customer.  The customer does it and the website sends a signed certificate saying, "John Smith is the owner of phone Serial number 12345".  The website would also send John Smith a link to change ownership, perhaps password protected.
**tl;dr: This would not be a good use of the blockchain.**

The problem with QR codes for bitcoin is that the information density is poor.  For example:
A bitcoin address is 160 bits.  That's just 20 bytes.  But most QR codes encode the ascii-armored base58 version, which is 34 characters, including 4 check characters.  But QR *already* has check characters built in, so there's no need.  Just encode the 160 bits without the base58.
The QR codes could be smaller and still reasonably safe.

I think that colored coins have a minimum value: the value of the bitcoin.  For colored coins to work, you need to modify all clients to prevent mixing colored coins with uncolored coins.  And it's unclear how to make more or remove them from circulation, as can be done with shares when diluted.
Also, how do you make a transaction that trades 2 BTC for 1 colored BTC?
I'm not a fan of colored coins.

From this:
It sounds to me that it doesn't lock the inputs, only restricts the use of the transaction.
As you explain, it wouldn't make sense, because what if a miner didn't get the transaction and instead processed a different transaction spending the inputs.  How would the other miners be able to verify the blockchain?

That account was over 0.5 the last time that I checked.  It has been going down slowly.

Good points.  We solve this problem today with separate ledgers.  Each bank maintains just its accounts, not *all* the accounts.  With bitcoin, each node has everything.
Is there a way to split things up?  You could invent a different cryptocoin for each community but then how do you trade between communities?  Online exchanges, but they are external to the system and centralized, defeating some of the purpose.
I don't have a good solution for this.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:31:25
Here's a silly and simple one:
I want to put a comment into the transaction chain so that when my I tell my friends, "See, I told you he'd go down in the first round," and they call bullshit, I can show them in the blockchain where I wrote my prediction.  I'll pay whatever per-byte fee the transactions already cost.

The point that I was trying to make was that people regularly trade in things that appreciate in value for things that don't.  Those USD, for instance, could buy T-bills.  It's an argument against the no-one-will-spend-deflationary-currency.

Those companies can use OpenID to login.  Similar to the "log in with Facebook" or "login with Google" buttons that you see on some apps.  In the end it saves the developer time because, inevitably, a user will forget his password and it'll be Google/Facebook's problem to deal with.

Instead of just publishing the transaction to the network and waiting for blockchain.info to show it, you can send it to the receiver, too, and he can publish it, too, and check that it's valid.  That just as good at the credit card transaction.
I think that the Android Wallet can do it.  I must say: Bitcoin has been around for a while but the software still sucks.
