Lol it's cheating tho, how can you complete against cheater? Do you have 500 million to build a dedicated fibre optics line with direct access to a stock exchange? Ah well, guys like you is why they get away with robbing the public blind.  Btw the example I gave you above clearly shows its unethical and illegal, they only executed trades based against your choice to buy shares, and take a spread so fast you didn't notice. That's not a trading strategy, thats front running. Look it up. It's not physically possible to compete with that.

It's the same as you trying to buy a beer for 10 bucks but as you pay you magically get charged 10.10. Might seem neglible on one order but it shrinks the spreads for retail traders and investors.

That's not what I mean. They're taking 2-3 billion dollars out of the market place that would other wise be in retail investors pockets. No one complains because if you try to buy 50k shares at 10.00 (500k capital) you get filled at 10.01 and think of losing that penny ($500.00) as just part of executing bigger size. That mini spread which is taken advantage of in milliseconds accounts for the billions they make at year's end that no one seems to care they're taking.

Roflmao, nice reply bro.  Guess you're still part of the 99% club.

As a professional trader for 14 years I can assure that while maybe legal, it is definitely an unfair advantage.  By unfair I mean impossible to compete with and essentially taxing retail investors without them even knowing it.
