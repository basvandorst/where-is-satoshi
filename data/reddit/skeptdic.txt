This iis an assumption I'm making, but it's based on historical fact with a dash of Occam's Razor.
Doing it from the outside is possible, but it's less likely to occur based upon previous incidents if we assume (we have to, more or less in this scenario) that the company follows best practices and holds no blame.
I don't know about you, but inside job is pretty much a sure thing.  Always has been, anyway.

I'm pretty sure that's just how it goes for most people who first get into crypto without a cypherpunk background.
You either get robbed by proxy, trade it away, or get suckered in to chasing the Next Big Thing™.
The only proven safe play that I've seen is to hodl your own keys over long periods of time.  The longer, the better.

They all say they were hacked when it's pretty clear it was an inside job.  Every.  Single.  Time.
The only exchange that offered any sort of creativity was Quadriga, who claims the owner was the only guy with the keys and he "died" in India.
Go back as far as you want.  Gox, Cryptsy, Bitfinex, Quadriga, Binance.  It doesn't matter.  You can't hack a private key (yet).  You can only defeat all of the other "security" around the keys.
There's still a huge need for centralized exchanges, but they should be treated like a port-a-john at a shitty music festival.  Get in, do your business, and GTFO.
 YOUR KEYS; NOT YOUR COINS.

In my experience, FIs do as little as legally possible to save money.  They cling to the use of the word "reasonable" in the guidance from FinCEN/OFAC, etc.  Sometimes there are discussions that involve cost/benefit on cutting corners vs fines.  If they can save money by doing less and eating a fine, they will.
Any FI can set their own internal guidelines, but I'd say that they're heavily reliant on fiat FIs due diligence and compliance for ingress and egress of funds.
Two things I know about Coinbase are that:
*They fought a blanket subpoena for records.
*They have what might be the most sophisticated crypto search capabilities for an exchange in the industry.  If you gamble, they will know.  If you use the dark web for any sort of purchase, they will know.
The source of their fiat passes through the sieve of conventional FIs, but their source of crypto is something they have to police themselves.
The issue I've seen with non-cash FIs is that the customers seem to conflate the cash rule with other forms of remittance, which makes them easier to spot.  
If you're not using fiat, it's best to wholly ignore the $10k+ aggregate rule.  Behaving as if it's a thing causes more trouble for legit users than not.  They're looking for people who conduct transactions that "don't make sense", and it makes absolutely no sense to run three transactions when one will do.

Lying isn't illegal.  Being an attention whore isn't illegal.  Being a dumb fuck isn't illegal.  He seems to be *trying* to profit from this impersonation, but failing miserably.
I'm not an expert in faketoshi's dealings, but I don't think he's a criminal (technically).  If only because his bullshit stinks so bad that nobody will literally buy it based upon his misrepresented version of reality (fraud).
Also, I'm not a fan of crying to the Feds to solve problems involving Bitcoin.  They're as crooked as faketoshi is, as proven by Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force.
Then again, faketoshi has a few appearances before a bench in his future.

Here come the pedants!
To keep with your metaphor:
First they'd have to get past my alarm.  Then my shotgun.  Then my password.  Then my other password.  Then my pin.  Then!  And only then could they take the small amount of coins I keep on my hot wallet.
I'd have to invite them in, tell them all of my passwords, tell them I only have the shotgun to hold open the door when it gets windy, and then tell them I won't watch anything they do while they come and go as they please.
Companies use the term to appear blameless.  You are not even technically correct.

A SAR can be filed for plenty of reasons where the FI/investigator feels the activity is suspicious.
We were talking primarily about trigger limits, but you're right.
If your name happens to be similar to someone who is on one of the myriad lists, and the bank can't be reasonably comfortable with who say you are.. you're going to get frozen and filed on.
If your wire was sourced from cash that seems unreasonable for your demo/account activity, or from/to a high risk region, or to a listed individual.. frozen, investigated, and filed on.
The list goes on.  It's all a tree of if-thens.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:39:17
Yeah.  To piggyback, because you beat me to it:
Why are the only arguments planted in a concept that Binance is a singular "they", rather than a "they of singulars"?
Only takes one person in a poorly secured organization to walk away with funds.
Further, since speculation seems rampant, why couldn't a powerful external entity or individual compel the release of these funds under the guise of a "hack" with a threat?
My point isn't that it COULDN'T be a "hack".  My point is that it hasn't been a "hack" in previous occurrences, so why would it be the case now?  
A person with too much access and a motive (define: inside job) has always been the cause in the past.  If there are exceptions, they are few and far between.

You appear to have a really tough time with non-specific language, use of paragraphs, and/or metaphor.
