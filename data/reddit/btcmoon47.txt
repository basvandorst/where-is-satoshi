Prepare for the NWO
@_date: 2016-04-16 22:40:10

@_date: 2016-04-16 22:13:43
of course they did, otherwise they would be fucked. nothing new here unfortunately
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:32:29
electrum and i believe satoshi himself quoted that was the fix to the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:56:48
You are an idiot. Not even worth putting out a counter argument to this statement.
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:36:45

im looking for a big ass cuban link chain with 24k gold 
@_date: 2016-04-23 20:22:13
so why are we implementing this garbage lightning network? What problem will LN solve? Don't think bitcoin has any current problems right now so LN is just a waste.
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:42:51
looks clean
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:17:58
10000 within the next 10 months
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:54:56
Fuck the euro too, russia and china are smart enough to deal using their own currency. (RMB)
@_date: 2016-04-28 05:48:13
We wont go any lower than 400$ with halving coming up that's for sure. It's a risky time to sell now so the cock sucking whales should be smart before they dump.
@_date: 2016-04-25 00:45:50
thats how it will work for the next few years
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:29:54
But why would i need to pay more fees..I never had this issue in the past. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:07:14


I believe that is the issue and should be fixed asap to restore the speed of transactions.
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:24:07
Couldn't they fix it now by using something like this?
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:16:48
well im in the 100k club so suck my dick karma whore
@_date: 2016-04-17 08:50:04
What is the solution to full blocks? When will it be fixed? I believe this issue should be top priority because it is causing everything to be slow sadly.
@_date: 2016-04-16 23:00:38
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:23:38
I am putting fees
@_date: 2016-04-17 08:55:29
I am not the only one who is having this issue, many of my friends are experiencing the same problem. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 05:41:21
Because they aren't stupid and don't believe in monopoly money + south africa is part of brics.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:06:37
craig wright is 100% satoshi. anyone who does not agree is in denial.
@_date: 2016-05-02 00:17:11
its may already
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:50:48
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:11:28
Why hasn't segwit been implemented yet? It was supposed to be deployed by miners before may.
