Yes. Pleased to meet you.
My apologies for being dead for over a year.

That's not what i'm talking about, i'm talking about the video creator actually making the add part of the video. You can't magically stop me from holding up a frying pan during my video and directly telling you "buy this".
Let me show you:
Right there i tell you straight out where to buy gallium. Did your ad blocker stop me from saying that?
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:07:20
I did, i already experimented with bitcoin in 2011. I was met with mixed reception.
In any case, it's too late for me now to try again, my channel is dead.

I'd love to, but i don't have enough money to start a lab. And the lab i work at doesn't let me film videos there (not their fault, they don't want liability if something bad should happen).

And there you go, the ad **worked**. And that is why donations don't work. 
The fact that i was able to reach you and get you to think about buying that product is so valuable, so profitable, that the company was willing to pay me out the nose to get me to do it. 
**Extremely few** people donate to that level. the combined donations of everyone during my crowdsourcing did not match my ad revenue. 
Ads work, you've just proven it by telling me you're considering buying that product. Donations don't work. 
The free market is still sticking with ads. That says something.

The thing about ads is that ads work as opposed to donations. I have some direct empirical evidence to this effect. I started a crowdfunding campaign to revive my channel and made a video telling all my subscribers to donate (don't worry, they never met the funding goal so all their money was safely returned). 
Using donations methods that were very accessible to them (paypal) they actually donated less than the total ad revenue i was getting. 
So ads actually work better than donation drives.
Now i'm aware this is a sample size of just *one* youtube channel with 270,000 subscribers (at the time). so the results are at best anecdotal. 
Nonetheless, even with half my subscribers using ad-blockers, I was still making more from ads. This is not because ads pay well (they don't), it's because donations are generally VERY poor. 
Bitcoin is great, but it's not going to change revenue models from ad-based to donation-based, because very few people choose to donate to begin with. Bitcoin changes the mechanism of value transfer, but it will not change the person. During my donation drive in 2013, i received 0.15 bitcoins, (which i promptly returned when my funding goal wasn't met).
It's great you want to support youtubers by directly donating to them. but the hard truth is that you're in the minority, so they'll keep using ads for revenue generation. The better thing to do in that case would be to get every viewer to use ad-blockers rather than get everyone to use bitcoin. Then you actually destroy the youtuber's existing revenue source and force them either to quit, or accept less revenue and go with donations.

I actually experimented with bitcoin donations in 2011, my channel died in 2013, so it wasn't a fault of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:28:23
why thank you. I'm glad you like it! :)

I completely agree, i said before:


While my channel might be dead, i'm still friends with some bigger youtubers (+1 mill subs) and the overall concern for image and perception is still there. It's easy to believe in that bitcoin is mainstream and uncontroversial. But in the youtube community, the uneasiness around bitcoin still hangs over like a cloud. 
But granted, it is changing, and youtubers are catching on. I'm just saying in my post that you have to expect some resistance. Not because they're ignorant, but because they're worried about their image. A good youtuber does not get to 1 million subs without knowing exactly who their audience is and what they are thinking. You have to respect their decisions in what they want to present to their viewers.

I've had mixed reception to adding bitcoin to my video descriptions in 2011. a good deal of my viewers thought i was trying to push a ponzi scheme or questioned my intelligence for "falling" for one. While i did receive a few donations, and became good friends with one bitcoiner, on the whole I think it negatively affected my image as a youtuber.
While i do love the technological brilliance of the software (despite barely understanding how it works), I must consider how i am perceived by my viewers. On youtube, image is everything, and maintaining a certain image means i have to tone down how hard i promote bitcoin.
This is why larger youtubers are a bit reluctant to promote something like bitcoin that is perceived to be controversial or even questionably legal. Not because they actually think bitcoin is bad, but because they must maintain a certain youtube image. 
As bitcoin becomes more widespread and less controversial, the uptake by youtubers will increase as well.

I *never* said people want advertising. It's just that advertising is a better revenue model for youtubers than donations. Neither youtubers nor viewers want advertising. But if it's the most profitable way to monetize content then the free market will go to it regardless of how we feel about it. 


I guess my content wasn't worth encouraging as they donated less than the ad revenue XD heheh. j/k
But seriously now, people love free stuff. They've always loved free stuff. The funny part is: they'll love stuff they *perceive* as being free even if really deep down it isn't. Ad-supported channels are incredibly annoying, but are perceived as being "free". People were perfectly fine watching my content when it was "free", and i have tens of millions of views to prove it. But when the time came to rescue the channel, all it would have taken was $1 from each person to guarantee new videos every week for the next two years (and most likely longer). Instead they opted to let it die and move on to other free youtube channels. 
Seriously, $1 vs "annoying but free" for the exact same content, they've made it clear they'll pick free.
And i know you'll say you want to donate. And i say again: YOU are a good person who i would love to make content for. But you are also the *minority*. 
As for ad-blocking. I just remembered that channels are moving toward sponsored video revenue model. Basically I would negotiate with a particular ad-agency and after we agree on ads I would outright advertise the product directly in my video. The ad is *part* of the video. Ad-blockers don't work in that case. Check my video "gallium induced structural failure of a coke can" to see such an ad.
The free market is like that unfortunately. If you can somehow make donation-based channels really big, and have them generate more revenue then ad-based channels, then you can push the free market to abandon ads. In my personal experience though, it hasn't worked.
I know you'll disagree, but i'm the one that's holding an actual dead channel in my hand to prove it.


Granted, i don't know a lot about mining. But I believe that CPU mining through javascript is utterly useless because the hashing difficulty has made it so. Even with a perfectly idealized distribution and pooling of CPU resources with millions of page hits per day, the numbers just don't work for CPU/javascript mining any more. 


Why thank you. While it's a shame my experiment with bitcoin ended badly, it might end well for someone else. 
Despite all that i have said before, I have hope, and i love watching a technological revolution unfold before me :)

Back when i let people donate with paypal, which is mainstream, i still didn't get more revenue than the ads.
The problem isn't so much bitcoin not being mainstream, just that people donate less than what ads make. This problem is the same whether they're donating through paypal, google wallet, bitcoin etc.
