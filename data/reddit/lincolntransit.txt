It appears that the value only matters when it is exchanged from its form when originally bought. 
So buying a Crypto at a certain value is important. Once that Crypto is converted to another currency(crypto or not) then that second value is important. 
This obviously makes multiple transactions very complicated.

Dont know if you are still serious or not so ill clarify anyway.
 
NamedB said to ask where the manager's kids go to school as a joke that you could threaten the manager's kids if things don't work out as intended.

I feel like there is no wrong choice between the two. Maybe one will be "better" for you personally, and i would recommend looking at videos to see which you prefer. 
If you are still uncertain, flip a coin.

I didn't insult you so calm down.
It's a joke. A Joke that HE said. 
He doesn't actually want someone to threaten anybody he's making a joke. That's the reason why you were down voted because you took what he said as being something serious.

Ignoring state laws, does buying and selling BTC through localbitcoin require a transmitter license?
Is there a way to avoid needing a transmitter license?
(Such as, for example making transactions below a certain amount per time period and/or not charging your own transaction fee?)
Thank you in advance.

Is buying and selling bitcoin through localbitcoins legal so long as you report it to the gov? 
I'm interested in getting into crypto but without providing my personal information to an exchange. I'd like to be able to buy crypto(basically to HODL) and sell if the price goes up. 
I can't find concrete information that what i mentioned above would not legally require a transmitter's license. All the information i found ended at: you need a license if you're doing it as a "business". I can't find concrete information on what makes it a business.
