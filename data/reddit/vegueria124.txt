So a small influx results in a $1k increase (which I agree with), but Buffett investing billions won't move it more than $3k? Do you see the contradiction?
Point is, bitcoins price is manipulated and will move when big players want it to and when they want it to.

Get off YouTube and get some sleep bro...
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:57:25
Another thing to note. The price seems to be manipulated in a way that is going to introduce more of the population to Bitcoin with each cycle. Let me explain...
Large price rises = headlines, but at some point new interest will peak (December 2017). At that point, it's time to drop the price. Those newbies are now down big and many will hold onto it and continue to buy, building a new base of people holding Bitcoin for the long haul. Now the base is strong enough...it's time for a new growth phase (December 2018), force price to rise sporadically to keep making headlines, while coordinating some of those rises with other bullish news. Of course there is profit taking aspect along the way creating the corrections. Over time Bitcoin becomes more and more distributed and less volatile.
That's just my 2 SATS, or VET (whichever u prefer)

Ok bud. Have a great day.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:06:15
You're assuming the price moves because sell walls are eaten by buy orders. That's not what happens. The majority of the sell walls are taken down first then the buy orders come through. That's how it's manipulated.
Ironic that you're telling me to think logically when you just implied that bi weekly pay periods paid on Thursdays is what just moved the market.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:38:40
Lol...you're right. Everyone who got paid today bought Bitcoin within a 15 minute period.
These markets are manipulated as there is no regulation and coins are not well enough distributed. But keep trying to find a reason for the short-term volatility. The only thing that can be explained is the long term trend.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:49:38
Of course it's manipulation. But that doesn't matter. The question is where will they take it to next? It seems to me that the big move is coming in a time where Bitcoin is the topic of conversation in Washington, and in a bullish way. More exposure will lead to more retail buyers and a new cycle of significant growth.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:02:32
Youre a fool to think you have an idea of where things are going short term.

You have trouble with reading comprehension. You keep proving my points with every post.
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:38:46
I forgot to add that the person you pay with BTC is probably selling it for fiat so you are actually hurting the price when you put it in the hands of a business with no desire to hold it.
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:37:10
You don't seem to understand supply and demand. Holding Bitcoin reduces the supply on the market, benefiting the price. Artificial demand, created by people who think they're helping the cause by paying with Bitcoin when there is no real need to, isn't real demand. Demand for Bitcoin will need to come via actual need...
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:38:13
Says the guy who referred to me as a "loser," and then goes on to prove my point...
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:59:47
Thanks for supporting my argument. What you just described is artificial demand. Using it for the hell of it isn't real demand. And most places accepting it are flipping it for fiat immediately, creating more supply. You started the insults by criticizing "hodlers" when in reality they are doing more for BTC than the fools spending BTC without the real need to. Bitcoin demand as a currency has to come from an actual need to use Bitcoin over other methods of payment. If you're going to tell me I'm wrong, at least provide provide a logical explanation that doesn't reaffirm my point.
@_date: 2019-11-17 08:50:13
Are you both intentionally ignoring the fact that gold can be used for creating jewelry, electronics, etc. This characteristic alone, which Bitcoin will never have, gives it intrinsic value. I'm pro bitcoin but you can't ignore this trait if you're being honest.

@_date: 2019-02-16 02:50:14
When you consider that less than 5% of people have ever owned a piece of Bitcoin, and it hit $20k, it doesn't seem so farfetched.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:20:29
Look at this guy making the comment "that's not how markets work" pretending to know anything about markets.
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:46:13
It's higher than that. I'm talking about percentage of people who have EVER owned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:37:18
Ok, you aren't bright enough to see the most simple point I am making, which is to show that if Bitcoin hasn't even been touched by 95% of the world's population then it isn't crazy to predict $200k with that in mind.
I'm not making any predictions tool. Run along.
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:26:06
I said it isn't farfetched to predict a significant increase, just like it's not farfetched to predict it down to zero. Anyways, I'm done with this conversation, and not because of anything other than the fact that you are clearly incapable of comprehending what you read, and even more incapable of forming a logical argument. You're probably a teenager so jokes on me for even responding to your ignorant comment to begin with.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:29:42
Because I didn't explicitly say it can go down, I am being hypocritical? And what exactly am I accusing the price of? When you look up the word hypocritical, please also look up the word accuse. I'm very comfortable with the comment I made and laughing at each of your replies which ironically continues to prove your reading comprehension skills are lacking.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:00:04
I'm done. I literally said, "I am not making any price prediction" and here you are asking me to defend a price prediction. Stop listening to Cardi B, she is deteriorating your brain cells.
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:31:48
Chances are, the person you give Bitcoin to for goods/services is just selling it for fiat so it's a net zero effect on supply and demand. With that said, buying and holding onto bitcoin lowers the supply, having a positive impact on price.
Ya'll keep treating it as a medium of exchange, and I'll just keep holding it as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-02-16 16:58:51
Not true...if people don't want it, it will never reach $5k. Big difference.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:02:40
Yeah, I heard 5% one time but I thought it was a little high. Even better that less have ever touched it. That means, assuming people will see value in buying Bitcoin once they are exposed to it, there is a lot of room for growth.

One, you need to learn what "hypocritical" means. 
Two, you missed my point entirely. The point is, there is a lot of room for increased adoption. If that figure was 75%, well, there wouldn't much room for new buyers to enter the market. 
Three, 5% does not amount to 5.8 million in a world with 7 billion people. I am referring to people who have ever owned a Bitcoin, not currently holding.

Sometimes in the future maybe, and that is why ppl are holding and speculating that spending Bitcoin will make more sense in the future than it does now. There is very little reason to use Bitcoin over cash or credit cards at this point in time and in most cases, it's not possible to use Bitcoin. That's assuming you live in a country with a relatively stable currency.

In a world where people have no brains, you're right. So there's another assumption you need to add to your scenario.
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:51:16
Question for you all...
So a wallet's public key is used to send and receive funds. Giving someone  your public key allows them to see exactly how much Bitcoin you have. Isn't this problematic for people who want their finances kept private?
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:31:23
Ok, but to put an income producing asset's demand at zero, you also have to remove it's ability to produce income as that is the only scenario that it could reach zero demand. My point is, looking at it's "financial worth" in that sense is a pointless task.

Read the thread. Guy said 1 BTC is still 1 BTC. Same applies to BTC. I could've purchased 20,000 pizzas a year ago, now only 4,000. Point is, saying BTC is still 1 BTC is the equivalent to saying $1 is still $1.

Question...since there is no central authority, is there or will there ever be a mechanism to protect against human error in sending tokens (i.e. entering the wrong Bitcoin address)?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:13:54
What about a scenario where say Bitcoin gets adopted as a payment option on a e-commerce website. You buy something, pay in Bitcoin and then the seller doesn't fulfill their side of the transaction by shipping it to you. How could the transaction get disputed? There would have to be an intermediary. Is this where smart contracts come into play?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:55:47
I feel like that defeats the purpose as one of the attractive aspects of Bitcoin is cutting out intermediaries. I think the solution here is a smart contract that holds the funds in an intermediary address and releases it upon certain events happening (i.e. delivery of product). Even in that scenario though you will have disputes (i.e. product was damaged). Not sure how that would get solved.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:18:44
You're describing scenarios that won't ever exist unless the asset itself ceases to exist. There will always be demand for Bitcoin or other related crypto currency that accomplishes the same thing, and there will always be demand for an income producing asset or equity owning share (assuming the Company's valuation is above $0).
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:53:29
So a smart contract couldn't read information uploaded by one of the parties (i.e. tracking number on a shipment)?
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:54:59
Can ppl stop saying this? It makes no sense lol. $1 is always $1 too, just everything you use it for gets more expensive. Same with bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:06:38
Wrong! These posts are so dumb. Forcing people to use BTC just for the sake of using it will do nothing, and will probably do the opposite since businesses currently accepting BTC are immediately converting to fiat and adding sell pressure. The technology needs to improve to make it a more convenient or less costly method of payment. Either that or wait for the collapse of USD or other major fiat currencies (good luck on that one...).
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:03:23

The initial drop to $3k was basically a straight shot down from $20k. It found support at $3k and has very gradually increased over several months by almost 100% since. I think it's more likely to never go to $3k again. Then again, nobody knows so why even make the comment as if it's anything more than a guess and calling someone else delusional I'm the process.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:39:09
Why would anyone who bought at $1k, saw $20k and didn't sell, decide to sell at $1.5k? Lol...if they held this long, they are willing to lose what they put in.

Productive doesn't mean you have to agree. Your criticism lacks substance. You just constantly repeat your uneducated opinion over and over again. There has to be a reason you're here.

Better question. Should you take investing advice on Reddit? No.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:27:49
Except the last ATH was $1,000 before the climb to $20K. Had you sold at ATH plus 20%, you would've sold at $1,200 and never seen it go below that. Numbers might be a little off but you know what I mean  You're better off waiting to see a pull back after we have significantly surpassed the previous high than trying to time the peak.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:43:41

@_date: 2018-12-15 19:41:16
Everyone investing in bitcoin expects it will have higher value in the future. Meaning, 1 bitcoin could provide a down payment on a car today and outright buy a car in the future. It has nothing to do with conversion to fiat. Only reason to convert to fiat is to make purchases because merchants haven't fully adopted crypto as a method of payment. Investors are speculating on this happening in the future to some extent and are also speculating that the price will eventually stabilize (or become less volatile) as the user base increases, making it a legitimate store of value.
In other words, your post is stupid.
