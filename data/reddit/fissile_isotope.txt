"The pump in the past 40 days has been caused by institution investors taking a position in bitcoin. I don't have data to prove this speculation except my own intuition"
I love how people make assertions like this without any data to back it up. If institutional buyers were taking any kind of sizeable positions (even in the 10s of millions) I feel like the overall market cap would be way north of 10b by now. Consider that Global assets under management is approx 80T-100T. Bitcoin is a rounding error on those numbers.

Why do these thing need to be mutually exclusive? The reason I swallow my pride most of the time is BECAUSE I've come to grips with reality. Trash them all you want for their motives but you have to give them credit that they didn't proceed forward with a fork they knew would hurt the ecosystem.

What happens when you need to store millions of dollars worth. Do you keep those in a hardware wallet under your desk?

Well, I'm pretty sure they probably called it a ponzi scheme or something close to it. Humans be Humans.

And the name of the bar is Satoshi's?? How appropriate.

"The &gt;60% premium to NAV should seem strange to anyone who realizes how easy it is to buy Bitcoin and how ETF exchange mechanisms are supposed to work."
This has always confused me as well. Bitcoin isn't either harder to buy or harder to hold than other currencies. In fact, I think it's actually harder for me to buy foreign fiat than Bitcoin. So why the price delta? Are these people who want to hold in things like IRAs, etc.?

One small block for Bitcoin, one big block for Mankind.

That is correct. The ETF would be required to make purchases of the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin, as required by the structure of the ETF. 
I believe I read that the Wink ETF was going to IPO with 1m shares with each share at 1/10 of a bitcoin. That would mean they need to have about $66m worth of bitcoin on hand which is a significant number of BTC. My guess is that they have probably been buying for months OTC to get to this level.

I know the maths are hard but...
Value of all gold is approx. $7,917,705,108,170. 
There are 15,758,963 BTC currently mined. For $100,000 a coin, that's a market cap of $1,575,896,300,000 for Bitcoin.
So $100,000 coin = 20% of all gold.
1% of gold = $5024/BTC (which is still a nice rise from where we are currently)

After everything that has transpired you say he's "without a doubt" Satoshi? I think this speaks volumes about your ability to discern truth from lies. Wright very much reminds me of a certain Paul Ceglia who claimed to have created Facebook. He provided what turned out to be fraudulent evidence and was eventually arrested.
Wright is in this same bucket.

FWIW, the ACH delay isn't Coinbase, its the antiquated banking system clearing house. That said, most of my transfers took between 24-48 hours. Also, if you have the money in your USD wallet, the bitcoin buy should be instantaneous (as mine have all been) although there isn't as much volume on the CB exchanges so you may not get the best spot price. I'm curious what transaction took five day for the coin? Was it a buy from a CC or bank account?
