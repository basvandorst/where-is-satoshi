Yes, the article pointed out all of the catastrophes that struck the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2011, as any objective story should have at the time. That said, to me it seemed like it ended on a hopeful note: "“You could say it’s following Gartner’s Hype Cycle,” London-based core developer Amir Taaki says, referring to a theoretical technology-adoption-and-maturation curve that begins with a “technology trigger,” ascends to a “peak of inflated expectations,” collapses into a “trough of disillusionment,” and then climbs a “slope of enlightenment” until reaching a “plateau of productivity.” By this theory, bitcoin is clambering out of the trough, as people learn to value the infallible code and discard the human drama and wild fluctuations that surround it." 
... "It’s not the individuals behind the code who matter, but the code itself. And while people have stolen and cheated and abandoned the bitcoiners, the code has remained true." 
THE CODE HAS REMAINED TRUE. That's all a contrarian investor would have needed to read to know that despite all the human drama around it, the Bitcoin protocol was sound and had potential. 
I subscribe to Wired and somehow failed to open that issue. At that time, I subscribed only on my iPad, but now, because of missing that article, I go iPad and hard copy -- a physical magazine is much more likely to be read if it's sitting on my coffee table staring at me in the face, rather than requiring me to consciously decide to open it from the iPad Newsstand. So while I may have missed out on some massive profits, the experience of missing that article about a currency with no physical properties has, quite ironically, reminded me of the value of physical objects.
