Highly skeptical, but I promise to post a new thread here if anything comes through.

Truly amazing how any large bank manages to head towards insolvency in a political environment where all regulations are heavily tilted in the bank's favor versus the individual account holder's.

Much stable. So consistency.

Am I the only person who always reads "POS devices" as "Piece of Sh*t devices"?
I know what it really stands for, but "Piece of Sh*t" is the default acronym.

If he really is Satoshi (or part of a "Satoshi group") but didn't want it to be known, he should have implicated his deceased friend Kleiman as Satoshi. It would have been at least somewhat plausible, and dead men tell no tales. There would have been no proof that Kleiman wasn't Satoshi.
I guess the "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message couldn't have happened if Kleiman had been implicated, as he was dead by then. But anyway.

Why on earth would a majority of bitcoin holders ever decide to increase the 21M coin limit?!
If a poll were taken right now among people who own 1 BTC or more, would raising the coin limit even find 0.1% support, let alone a "majority"?

Mad that someone other than you gets to decide who gets to speak and who is silenced?
Streisand effect, dude. You're responsible for all the Classic support. Congratulations.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:33:33
But "a few big ones" is not a majority. And in any event, such a thing would cause the price to collapse overnight, most likely more than offsetting the doubling of coins. Doubling coins will not double the market cap.
IMO most of the anti-Classic folks are really grasping at straws. The fallout from a simple 2MB block size increase will be literally nothing.

0.75MB of additional transactions divided by the 3MB block increase = 0.25 or 25%
Even if you want to be generous and say the added space could cram in 1MB of extra transactions per block, that's still 1MB/3MB = 33% efficiency.
I'm talking about the efficiency of use of the added space, not the absolute amount of added transactions.


You are overestimating the number of bitcoin-related sites which use or even accept P2SH addresses. The three largest dark markets right now don't even recognize them as valid. I guarantee plenty of other sites don't accept them either. The entire bitcoin ecosystem is not going to upgrade their sites for every new Core version.
All of this is moot anyway, we both know it's not going to be activated as it is.

Segwit increases the block size by 3MB. (1MB to 4MB).
Out of that 3MB increase, on average only 25% is allocated towards increased transactions (an increase of 0.7 MB or 0.8 MB per block).
Although there may be reasons for this, it's hugely inefficient. It also assumes bitcoin users will suddenly adopt multi-sig addresses en masse over time, after years of an 11% adoption rate in that area. If everyone continues using multi-sig addresses at the current rate, the transaction increase benefits of SegWit drop to essentially nil.
All of this is why Segwit is going nowhere. If it had been packaged as a simple malleability fix that didn't revolve around P2SH address usage, it *may* have had better luck.

How did the Bitcoin network manage to function perfectly well for years on end without filled blocks?

That's questionable, taking into account current prices, the block reward in USD is probably higher now than it's been for most of bitcoin's existence.

You can't claim above that "Bitcoin Core doesn't control Bitcoin" and then two sentences later demand that those who don't support Core leave Bitcoin.
Neither you nor him get it, I guess... neither you, Peter, Core as a whole, nor the BU people to be fair, hold the exclusive rights to the name "Bitcoin community".
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:32:41
What are you talking about? Would you say "a price drop helps BU and the SegWit obstructionists"?
Hell no, you'd be crowing here, "Look, price dropping, told you so!!!"
Take your blinders off.

It's just hard not to laugh at certain people here who are desperately trying to come up with an explanation, any possible explanation other than the one staring them in the face.
Take note of all the usernames here who want to attribute this to anything other than positive Chinese sentiment. The BU announcement had nothing to do with the price bump, nothing!! Then prepare to chuckle when many of these same usernames instantaneously point to ViaBTC/Unlimited/Roger/etc if the price actually tumbles back to normal.
