Sounds like a great time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:41:52
never ever sell
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:49:20
I can't even buy on there anymore without verification. Wanted to pick up some Ether and Lite after maxing on BTC but they won't let me do anything but hodl. =/
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:31:25
always hodl
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:49:29
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:32:50
You should buy more while it's on sale.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:48:14
Finally in the green after 27 hours of hodling 
never sell
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:29:10
Leave xem alone. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:49:12
So far it's helping. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:56:45
What would you recommend for an American? Gemini? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:31:10
Broke the wall, yep. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:43:07
Finally some good advice. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:08:22


So glad I bought last night. Hope it drops down to 3k so I can BUY MORE BITCOIN. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:03:21
weak ass hands
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:40:31
You should have bought in at 9k. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:10:25
The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel

You can live without either kidney for a couple of weeks, but can you live with missing out on this sale?  
I don't think so. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:39:35
It was 9k yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:18:10
This is where I'm at, I jumped at 11.3 a few days ago. Kinda wish I waited until it fell to 9 but 11 is still a good price. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:49:05
we don't know whether it's heckin going up or down 
just hodl
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:11:32
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:49:57
a fellow genius here 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:46:40
Time to thot audit this man. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:25:31
hodl on a second 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:01:23
Last time I looked it was down around 7k and I decided to just hodl and walk away. Strong hands done me good.
