was surprised you got annihilated i thought it was funny
then i used my brain a little 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:46:37
1&gt; try to stop speaking for others
2&gt; let the ones who can see through all the nonsense come out on top
3&gt; i think most people already realize the deal here and are jsut too afraid to admit it
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:57:26
i'm hoping that the increase in perceived value will wake some up to the banking game, 
and see who are the actual violent ones
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:17:09
bitcoin is very scarce compared to usd, and even gold
everything else i said is also valid
look it up

see this is where the fail starts

i wouldn't be surprised if the IMF or some other big player has already in one way or another

it's a cynical mockery of the WOD and naivety, but leaves a bad taste
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:27:35
inflation is outlandishly more taxing than that
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:10:46
corrupted read in spite of reed soloman error correction code is probably very rare, but still i agree that with anything over a certain value should have a verified path first
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:00:24
this is complete horse shit
the only trust involved is the trust in the math behind ECC
any and all financial services offered would be pure folly
we ***don't*** like usury remember?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:50:21
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:08:17
they gotta back up their suspicions with fact, otherwise it's folly and diabolical

apple is draconian and stifles innovation
fuck the apple app store, 
Most people are oblivious to the "real" shit that goes on, like banning entire categories of apps for political reasons and other selfish agendas.

fuck i love that word
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:37:43
they will never stop their diabolical political adgendas
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:01:19


a powerful concept these days
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:11:11
and usury is supposed to meet animosity but they managed to change that (blur the lines) through their magic serpent eating its own tail
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:44:13


not to you apparently 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:14:25
semantics about taxation, it's taxation no matter how you put it
about scarcity
one may argue that btc is more scarce than gold
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:12:15
he's got a gun!
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:44:59
it hasn't even begun to get stupid yet.
these are the tiny sparks from the fuse
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:53:21
people will realize this on their own i think.  we don't have to go on cc missionaries or anything
you bleed someone almost to death (economic crash of '08) they are going to wonder wtf is going on
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:59:16
the banks will try to make it seem like the customers are the ones inciting and being violent all the while the banks are perpetuating the same mind controlling mantra, mixing in violence for just the right shade of control for the day
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:58:54
so basically banks become couriers for private keys, and maybe some fiat services (until traditional fiat is extinct)?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:36:12
the only way to avoid the nonsense is to boycott the anti cc entities, which requires awareness, so good on you
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:35:42
you are full of horse shit goodbye
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:07:34
believe it or not the greed came after the revolution sentiment, for me anyway
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:20:55
how does this help the network? is it actually doing any mining?  or just verification?
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:59:37
they can have the best staff and support staff in the world, 
that doesn't mean their walled garden will be appealing enough to buy into it
the positives don't outweigh the bad
it has become a fascist dictatorship trying to shape their little chunk of society, and i could have told you that this would happen when the app store first opened and I read up on their emphasis towards "what kind" of apps can be used, and how it only benefits them (but never the consumer) to ban certain apps, and they do it anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:51:37
promote pro cc practices and companies
boycott anti cc practices and companies
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:42:18
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:45:02
actually it's quite the opposite
they cram down our throats how to work with money even cardboard faux money
first grade...

I used to have a negative gut reaction about kids with cell phones but i've turned around.
I don't think they should have anything worth over 20 dollar wal mart special though.
i now think that it's a good idea to facilitate cell phones for your younglings, but only for communication with me or the wife, not sexting,  or any other mischevous behavior

what if it archives itself, well then there would be an infinite loop that collapses the universe!

Be careful: if you try to teach history or recent well known facts, you will be called a conspiracy nut.

the problem with a "preamble transaction" is that it takes a millennia for very tiny payments to get verified (compared to one with the average fee attached)

it's the ultimate censorship, controlling energy movement (money)
and the ultimate inhibitor through taxation (deflation) - if you look at the debt-backed fiat central banking side of it
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:16:59


trust has nothing to do with it
try scarcity
taxes are force, and who said anything about tax evasion
you are all over the place


this is a joke?
USD is backed by debt, try and comprehend that...
and inflation is a direct form of taxation, look it up
your shit's all fucked up you should go study or something
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:55:39
the primary function of cc is trust
it minimizes trust between the participants, so the only thing you have to trust is that the mathematics behind ECC remain the same and "uncracked"
people get all huffy about trust issues.  they seem to be fighting the notion that their precious debt-backed fiat is somehow trustworthy, don't make me laugh they print billions every month depreciating the value of the USD, draining the blood of our unborn children and their children!  YAYYYYY!!!!  The ultimate taxation in disguise.  Guaranteeing than any savings anyone has will be nearly worthless in time, limiting the scope and ability to save.  People who have saved for years and years and accrued wealth in gold backed greenbacks were slaughtered (in a sense) when they debased and devalued them after imposing fractional reserve banking.  The numbers stay the same, and the numbers are meaningless.  The debt increases, yet it means nothing. Everyone is in effect a debt and taxation slave. Something needs to change.
They pay you in monopoly money and then try to convince you that they don't tax the living shit out of it continually with deflation.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:52:55
money in the traditional sense?  or just money from some non cc aware teaching?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:43:27
to be fair though they have to know that no illegal activity is involved.
it's still unreasonable to block transfers without reasonable suspicion, which is straight up toxic hostage situation
