So in the early days, Bitcoin was -217.78€ ?

Thanks for the reply, that's also my concern : once we hit the 2017 ATH value there might be a massive selling trend that would drag the value down to maybe &lt;8k, that's where I'd like to buy.
But given the rise and fall observed over the years, I'm also concerned that the fall following the next 19/20k milestone might not be going this low, and I should buy now before BTC never comes back to this price level.
(hope you can understand me, I'm not a native speaker and my sentences might be long and twisty)

Thanks, I'll definitely check both today!

Isn't it what make BTC risky ? This is exactly what would cause bitcoin fall in the end I think. Everyone (or the vast majority of BTC holders) looking for money that just can't work on the long run.
I mean I undestrand why we feel and act this way, I just can't see the logic. Bitcoin got so big I thought it'd be because people embrace the goal, not because it's another trendy investment. Or maybe it's only an impression from this sub.

So people stock their money in BTC to avoid getting fucked by the banks while hoping to sell back for more than they invested in order to have more cash with which the banks will fuck them again and even more ? Again, I can see why people act like this but I can't see how it can work.

Thank you very much for the feedback ! Would you recommand enabling SPV or does it seem unnecessary to you ? Same question for PGP key ?

Also I am no utopian, nor am I trying to condemn wealth in any way, I am just asking.
Let me present it this way : people are treating bitcoin like a stock that is risky *but* could eventually generate massive gains... If people understand why it is so game changing and hop on the Bitcoin train for what it's intended to be and not for the dollar they could get from it. Now that is a fucking paradox to me.

I would upvote twice if I could.

Of course and I am following the trends too, but I meant that when I see people looking for the value to go up they are usually doing so because they want to sell later for more, not just because they're happy Bitcoin is "growing".
