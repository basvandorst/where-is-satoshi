The thing is that I invested as much as I am comfortable losing right now. To be transparent I hold Ether and Litecoin. Both of wish I support and see the upside in their tech. I just don't see bitcoin being overtaken, it seems like such a powehouse and i feel like not exchanging my crypto to bitcoin could be foolish, but who knows. Someone get me a magic eight ball

I use electrum but a co-worker of mine has his coins on an exodus wallet. Will he be able to safely export his BCH into electron cash by exporting his private keys and restoring it on electron cash. Will this effect his BTC balance in exodus. Advice from anyone using Exodus or anyone with knowledge on the matter would be much appreciated!

When I needed financial advice, I decided to enter the 36 chambers and step to the muhfukkin Wu, where they told me to diversify my bonds. Now I'm makin' stacks and drinkin' 'gnac every day!"

So I have my BTC in an electrum wallet. If I do not follow their recommended steps and just keep my coins in my current wallet what happens? I don't get any BCC? Or I do have BCC and can't use them until I transfer them onto an environment like electron cash

Thank you. May as well do what electrum is advising and hold my bcc on electron cash, seems silly not to.

Is there a time frame after the fork to "redeem" your BCC? Or can I follow these steps above whenever?

Very helpful! Thank you.

I purchased for a long term investment via coinbase a while ago and can't really wrap my head around the USAF and the August 1 deadline. What do I need to do, if anything, to protect myself from potential disaster? Is there even going to be a disastrous outcome? From my research it seems like it is possible coinbase will just randomly assign my coins to one of the two chains and I could just be SOL.
