So you mean to tell me Obama really is a socialist dictator?!
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:35:03
Thanks.  I think its because people confuse believing in bitcoin with smart investing.  finances 101, diversify.

 obviously nobody bought him flowers
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:06:48
Oh good point.  You cannnnn buy doge with btc atm, its just hard.  Bad GUI design on my part.  If you click the Sell it turns to buy,  You would buy doge but you wouldnt know how much BTC you were spending. Great catch :)

Tax evasion has been a crime since taxes have been around.  Way before the 1930s.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:48:03
tax evasion is a victimless crime, yet its been a crime forever.
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:24:25
Got the same email. What do now?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:40:32
Not that I hope this happens, but 10 years it is possible bitcoin wont be worth anything
Edit: People seem to think that bitcoin will be the end all be all.  For people living in the digital age, you sure fear change.

It doesn't have to be widespread to be a bubble.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:46:08
Your argument fails to mention all the good that government does.

Okay, currently they are listed by ID  but I agree.  That was gonna be my next biggest thing.  That and adding search functionality.  Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:19:41
Thank you for thinking critically and not emotionally

Movie prices skyrocket since 1950%.  More at 11!

We wants it? Gollum?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:03:54
But you would still have less money than gox lost!
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:13:42
It wouldnt be a very good trap ;p  iv tried to be as transparent as I can be, you even know my full name.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:07:35
You have described my thoughts perfectly.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:15:54
Until you do something with it that is traceable, say buy something that requires an address or exhange for fiat.

Takes me about 10 seconds to buy anything online. And I'm still protected
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:32:22

@_date: 2014-03-10 08:19:10
I counter with a upvote to your comment.  Your move sir.

"Roughly three quarters of a million people missing from the olympics." When asked what happened "uhh we lost em"
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:15:00
Thats a horrible idea.  Disregarding the loopholes from defining personal wealth, a punishment should be proportional to the crime, not the perpetrator.
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:26:10
If bitcoin goes up, the government makes money...?
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:04:33
This has to be the dumbest comment I have ever seen... banking without oversight would be GOOD?  Seriously?
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:25:52
Seriously if you pay your credit card bills on time your bank give you money through points.
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:40:52
p2p is much harder to hack
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:43:07
Honestly for some people it was a place of wrong place wrong time.  I got started in doge fairly late in the game (relative to all yall ofc).  I doubled my investment, cashed half of it to bitcoin sent it to gox and was waiting over a month to get verified.  It was my mistake I didnt know they had been going downhill for months, but I dont think anything I did could be considered stupid. Oh well, live and learn.
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:38:07
No fuck you, your wrong and no amount of evidence to the contrary will change my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:10:40
So as long as I make more than that im good yeah?
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:23:43

Lower cost of tx?

I love that people have difference of opinions.  It can lead to important discussions, and great things.  Example: the constitution (of the US) was not so easily accepted upon drafting.  It was a lot of give and take between the north and south, elitists vs populists,  federalists vs anti-federalists ect.  But I dont see discussion here.  I see circlejerking, DAE hate America, Government is evil type mantra. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:03:43
real one or fake one?

@_date: 2014-03-08 05:06:21
was trying to cash out.  figured with how long had been there I was safe. like I said, live and learn!
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:42:29
Your gonna have a bad time. Bitcoin and cryptos in general are  very volatile.  You dont invest money in volatility that you cant live without. Just my two doge.  
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:45:31
I am the first ;).  Yeah that is the Google playstore for desktop, to access it from your phone you must do it from the app (I believe).  Thank you!  I appreciate it very much.  Please give me feedback, comments, changes, errors, ect.  Looking to improve this over summer!
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:29:33
For sure. It's hard Cuz some markets are btc_x and some are x_btc. I will try to implement a search feature and I will aphabitize them :)  thank you so much.  Your are the only fee back I've gotten :p
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:39:25
Was with you until  and then   The trademark violation is nothing bc he is not using it to make money. but the bus vandalism annoys me.  Its not so bad cause im sure it comes off but still.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:18
Bittrex is still hovering around 9.4k
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:20:05
This is basically trading on margin.  Highly risky if you don't have experience in it.  If BTC drops then you are double screwed.  Dont invest money you can afford lose.
