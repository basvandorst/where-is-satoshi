Nope. Anything that ethereum can possibly do can be built on top of bitcoin. Don't believe the hype/spam.

Or maybe creating Litecoin is simply the greater achievement.

Lmao, no it isn't.

Sorry, no. There was a blogpost shared around these parts not too long ago that outlined a specific popular online community that essentially allowed trolling/brigading because they wanted to remain "censorship free". Long story short, the community died shortly after. Was just looking for this write up and wanted to share it with some people who are operating in the same manner.

Nothing. Classic becomes another failed alt.

Electrum.

Delete it.

Weak/slimy ass attempt to drive more business from the clueless fork camps. (Coinbase and Circle both heavy offenders)

Yep. Theymos moderation policies serve to protect bitcoin and it's image. is a toxic takeover attempt.

If 1/7th of all Steam users bought a bitcoin, there would be no more bitcoins left.

We get you want everyone to like you...but this type of attitude doesn't help when /rbtc is obviously toxic to bitcoin. It's mind blowing if you don't see this. As someone else said, if you aren't shilling, you really need to open your eyes.

Really makes you wonder about some of the CB employees putting up with this dipshit.
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:40:31
Yes! Thank you!

Or just stop using their video and trying to smear their campaign. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:04:33
Post is shit. Just like classic.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:39:35
It wasn't a Reddit community or bitcoin community. I definitely have seen the post shared around these parts though. Mainly in a point to show that has done the right thing with moderation.

Your vid sucks.
