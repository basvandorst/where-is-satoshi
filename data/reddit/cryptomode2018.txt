It never gets any harder to print money. It gets much harder to mine BTC with decreasing reward and a limited coin supply.

Why don't some of you guys see that every time a whale sells(Mt Gox included), they get weaker and the assets get distributed as they are bought by smart money people buying the dips? Every time there is a sell off by these people, it's VERY healthy for the advancement of BTC. You think 12k to 9k is big...imagine at 100k if they sold everything. Better to weaken the bastards now while BTC is still down 3k than to lose 10's of thousands later

Hibernate please,

We need to get you under anesthesia...the price is jumping since you went into hibernation

Wouldn't placing a market buy order after a market sell order have an escalating effect in the price just like selling to market drops it? I don't know of anyone seeing a 100,000 BTC limit order being placed

I should have been a bit more specific. You are assuming that a miner is mining as it used to be back in the day. Yes it used to be like that. Not anymore though and that's why I assume the actual impact miners with large buildings dedicated to mining operating with plenty of operational solar power will always be mining since the cost would just be the equipment which for the most part would still be plenty profitable at that point. There is not just one person or entity with those kind of mining operations either. Even someone in the general public can go solar with their house and factor in mining into the equation of distribution these days as affordable as it is and with the government incentives(USA at least).

Its better to get on another plane for a few days.

If you are a miner and your break even basis is for example- 4k USD. 
A simple way to look at things:
Bitcoin drops to 3900
You stop selling and hold in order to not lose fiat
Every miner eventually holds to not lose fiat in that scenario as it affects them
Miners continue to mine knowing the chain of causation and every miner in that position will need to hold to prevent loss at some point
Price of BTC goes up
Other factors include: Sell off exhaustion(even whales eventually run out), world news, new tech(roadmap goals being met), influential exposure
Essentially, the risk of a 51% attack happening directly from a price drop of BTC is very low but none the less still possible. I don't know the exact drop in a two week period answer but it would be an interesting answer if someone can calculate that

I think higher but that is only my opinion of course. *cue youtube "not a financial advisor" disclaimer*
