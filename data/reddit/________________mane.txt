Nobody "owns" subreddits. He moderates it, with open moderation logs. Again, I give no fucks about Roger and your reduction of the discussion to Roger is just silly.
I wonder why this isn't showing up in the discussions link. I guess because you guys reposted it today in here. Thanks for proof. I was wrong that it wasn't posted on It wasn't posted there today, which could still skew results.

Wow a poll on your forum used to justify your point of view. How crazy is that? It's almost as crazy as the other side signing with private keys and saying they have the economic majority, which is also sybil resistant. 
Both sides of this debate are the exact same, it's just sad at this point.

Have they confirmed they were able to seize the BTC-E cold wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:15:12
Because 80%+ of miners agreed to it, 50+ Bitcoin businesses that represent millions of Bitcoin users agreed to it. A guy that is largely apolitical is in charge of the repo. He's making it compatible with UASF. 
The only difference between what you want and what you are getting is a 2 MB hard fork. Compromise is the way.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:39:13
You aren't understanding my point. My point is, if UASF is successful, which implies a vast mining majority, after 72 hours Bitmain is hopping on your chain because they have a bunch of low quality toasters if they don't.
In which case nothing has changed. The chinese miners are still there. There is no outcome where the chinese miners magically disappear. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:31:20

How nice and dishonest of you. Glad you aren't a 80%+ miner.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:10:43
This is an opinion piece. A lot of people disagree with your perspective. 
 


lol. At some point, the block size must increase. Even lightning developers have said it.


Nah. You are just pissing off a lot of the community with your irresponsible UASF. UAHF wouldn't even exist if UASF wasn't a threat.


Bitcoin has continued onward and upward through many such threats, and will continue to.
We feel the same way about your UASF. Hopefully Segwit2x goes through. The community has lost its mind. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:16:22
I don't think so. They are doing this to prevent a reorg between the surviving chain (after they tack on their blocks to make it UAHF) and the UASF chain. There will exist three chains that day if this goes through. The original chain that didn't adopt segwit, UASF, and UAHF.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:18:22
Cool, send me a link. I don't mind being wrong but I like evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:27:01
If you don't get a majority hash rate you will be easily attacked which hurts your value proposition greatly. UASF, as far as I have seen, does not have the necessary economic players to make it viable. It needs way more exchange support.
I'm not trying to convince you to do anything. I'm merely telling you what I will do.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:14:08
Yes.. you are the "real" cryptocurrency supporters. What a silly statement. I just want a block size increase but fuck me right? For some reason nobody can compromise, the NYA is the last hope.
 &gt; Jihan and his goons aren't going to HF, that would be the end of them.
Considering hash power is basically everything, this isn't true. 


They are saying that's what they will do in the OP. So you will get your wish if NYA falls through.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:54:03
Ok. Good luck to you too.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:00:57
A measly 2 MB block size does not shoot "bandwidth through the roof."


This reads like smear to me but ok. It's weird he wants "control of development" when in his piece he has 3 different independent teams trying to develop the UAHF. It's weird that their futures roadmap has all the same technology core wants with the one caveat of larger blocks.
Just meet him in the middle for a 2 MB hard fork. Your insistence to the contrary is what is driving this whole thing to become a game of brinksmanship.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:12:56


Segwit2x is what consensus is mandating. So yes you are right, he will activate Segwit, but he will also get his 2 MB hard fork. I'm very glad Bitcoin businesses see the need to compromise even though you and several others in here don't. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:31:05
No loyalties. Voluntary association. 
We merely disagree with what is important. We can exist together or separate, it doesn't really matter at this point, after years of contention. You do you.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:02:06
I fail to see your point. If I don't want to be part of your UASF, you have a bunch of blocks I don't have as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:26:21


Yes, but people need a usable chain. A chain with 6% of the mining power of the current main chain is mostly unusable. The difficulty readjustment would take forever, confirmations would take forever, fees would skyrocket (if we assume you for some reason can hold an economic majority in these conditions).


lol, I had never seen this before. What a terrible idea.


Me too. A hard fork to 2MB does not hurt this. The alternative is everyone in here risking a successful UAHF, in which case everything you want vanishes out the window. If we can't compromise, one side is going to lose completely.
Which side that is is not clear at this time.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:41:42
Their "Future Roadmap" section includes Segwit, as long as there is no patent risk, which to my knowledge there is not.
Their roadmap literally has all the shit you guys want: Rootstock, Lightning, Schnorr, Segwit, etc. 
The one difference is a larger block size.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:38:12
It doesn't prevent the attack. You cannot prevent other parties from doing what they want in Bitcoin. They are saying "hey, you are attempting to force people into this chain. We believe that the economic majority does not want in on this chain, they want larger blocks and Segwit. We are going to offer this chain so that they can vote with their feet, and we can simultaneously prevent a reorg by doing it."
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:29:40
You think Rootstock is going to just stop developing after getting fat stacks of cash in fundraising rounds? Segwit is already developed and implemented so there is a reference implementation. IDK who they would get to maintain them, probably the 3 independent teams they have developing now. Funny comment though.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:52:43
I want Segwit2x more than anything. I want compromise. UAwhatevers set horrible precedence but all parties know they are a real option.


The chances of both surviving are pretty small. Wherever the hash power ends up will be the winner. I agree that we want one united chain. We want a community that can compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:22:05
lol ok man, agree to disagree at this point. Reason will prevail.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:25:51
There is a grey area here. Both sides are extremely shitty to each other. It's not black and white.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:23:38
I think I just responded to you but I will do so again because this point is very easily countered.
Litecoin needed 75% for a Segwit lock in. Bitcoin needs 95%. Bitmain isn't preventing it from activating.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:13:15


Agree to disagree at this point. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:11:48
Oh sorry. Some guy called me a fanatic the same exact time you made your comment, so I assumed you were talking about me. I didn't expand the context because I thought they were based on the same root. My apologies.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:04:39


Maybe you missed the "Future Roadmap" part which includes pretty much everything Core wants except it has a higher block size.
Segwit, Lightning, Rootstock, Schnorr, etc.
Soft caps can still be implemented by the miners themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:34:41
That is incorrect. They said you go your way, we go ours. They are solely focused on preserving their chain in the highly unlikely event of a successful UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:40:06
They are offering a service I want, so I am happy. But sure call me fanatical, for some reason me being forced to UASF if it works isn't fanatical to you guys. I'm just glad I will have an option for a chain I believe in since you guys are doing the same thing.
Slander is fun I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:06:52
So you forcing a UASF without wide consensus agreement isn't hijacking Bitcoin but a UAHF in response to the above is? 
This is blatant hypocrisy, plain and simple. I wish you would be more honest with yourself.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:47:22


Your definition of "good tech" goes against their definition of "good tech." Do you see the problem?
Your definition of "good tech" is not what a majority of businesses and miners agreed to.


Re-quoting because compromising is how you make good tech. During the design decisions, you compromise on what is both practical and technologically advantageous. Your whole life is built by compromise and finding middle ground.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:08:43


He's not attacking your chain at all. That would be him taking over 51% of your hashing power and doing all the attacks he wants. He's merely starting his own chain because he thinks the economic majority is with him. He will stop mining it after 72 hours if the economic majority isn't. It's actually pretty reasonable.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:21:15


lol. It's amazing how both communities hate each other so much. "This will end Bitcoin. Working together to find a solution involving millions of users involves only my way or the highway."


Litecoin only needed 75%, so you're wrong. 95% is a crazy high number.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:42:54

@_date: 2017-06-15 21:14:33
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:57:43
Except they aren't blocking it. You needed 95% in the original proposal. 
Does that look anywhere close to 95% to you?
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:54:39
I hate this stupid argument. What if Bitmain and all Chinese miners switched to UASF? The Chinese government threat still looms. 
If UASF is successful that's what will happen. You will get all the miners. Even Bitmain implies this in the article.


If they are the small chain after 72 hours, they aren't going to support it anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:02:11
I do not believe this is correct. 3 chains could easily exist that day. Unless literally every miner is on UASF or UAHF, there will be a third chain.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:27:20
Do you not understand some people disagree with you? They aren't hijacking anything. They are preserving a separate chain for us that disagree with the methods employed by UASF. You can go on UASF and live a great life. I'll go on UAHF and live my great life.
Downvoted for voluntary association. Yeesh.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:15:40
So he's doing a shady hijacking but UASF isn't a hijacking.
Gotcha. It's good when you want it to be and not when you say so.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:54:59
You see it one way, sees it the other. We can meet in the middle with NYA or go our separate ways. You insist you are the "right" ones, but I don't agree with you guys at all. So I would use the other chain in that case. It's not meant as an offensive, it's merely a difference of opinion on what is important.
We have the right to UAHF just as you have the right to UASF. To suggest otherwise is hypocrisy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:13:17


I outlined why in my post compromise makes for good tech. You just glossed over that.


Terrible argument but since it's such a shitpost I won't bother countering it. Have a good one.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:52:26


Somewhat. I'm not loyal. I want a block size increase and Segwit. I would much prefer Segwit2x. It really depends on what will happen with the mining hash rate that isn't part of the UASF or UAHF. If that dries up or the majority is UAHF, I will go there. My coins will exist on all chains so that is pretty convenient. If only Bitmain exists on the UAHF, then I will not use it because I'm following the mining majority, that's the true chain.


I agree that at some point it is a crucial error, it's just not at 2 MB. Even lightning developers say they need bigger blocks to be able to support more users. 
No matter what there are only so many seats on the Bitcoin main chain bus. If we make the block size bigger, we get more seats for main chain users and L2 layers.


Ok. You imply my doom but at least you were mostly reasonable in your discussion. Thanks.
