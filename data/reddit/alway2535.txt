More importantly, China is about to go full green on their power production, since solar is just about to reach coal parity in China (already there if you count social/political cost). Which means less coal imports from Australia and thus a not insubstantial dip in GDP.
Though I doubt it will have any noticeable effect on bitcoin. Bitcoin thrives on news stories about bitcoin, not so much crises.

"Can be," "will be," and "are" happen to be very different cases. In that the former two are worthless ex post facto.

Or if you're not actually making any money from it anyway, point your computers at distributed computing projects ala 
and actually do something useful with your computer.
"How do you heat your house?"
"By curing cancer."

No it isn't. It may be outside of the jurisdiction of the FBI, but the NSA has full permission to do basically whatever they want outside of the US.

More importantly, employees cost more than just their wages. There's everything from recruitment and training costs to the cost of the square footage to give them places to walk and stand. These costs come out to around what their wages are. It isn't even a case of a "race to the bottom", it's that the "bottom" for automation is well below that of any human, even if it were 0 wage slave labor.

"I bet you don't even know how beanie-babies are made!"
Seriously though, that tactic is called gish-galloping, and you shouldn't ever use it. Nobody in the audience cares about your random tangential trivia, nor your ability to spew it en masse. Stay on the topic at hand if your interest is in anything but preaching to the choir.

Additionally, anyone who has actually taken a course in economics should know that an ethos of saving is a bad thing. 
Economies are driven by spending. Collecting what you can, and then saving it, will result in much lower standards of living for everyone than collecting what you can, and reinvesting it into the future. You could take your money and go live in a hole, or you can use it to create a business which creates value for everyone. That's how society functions.

"Most of us?" That's a terrible demographic. "Most of us" is a tiny percentage of a percent of the world markets. 
When it comes to the average Joe, they have no skin in the game, an average of zero ideological points to push with it. If you want btc to be anything more than an asset commodity for speculators and libertarian circlejerking, it absolutely needs to have ease of use.
Quite frankly, as an average Joe, why would I use it? 
Security? So far as I'm concerned, my credit card is as secure as it gets. I could all but post the number online, and the bank's pattern recognition AI software would stop and alert me of any fraudulent charges. Sure, my account could be frozen by the bank; but for the average Joe, that isn't going to happen once in 100 lifetimes.
Away from manipulation of the state? The average Joe doesn't care about that; and if anything, sees it as beneficial that the value of their pay isn't going to drop by more than about 0.5% by the time they spend it on groceries. Bitcoin may rise over the long term, but a majority of people don't have the luxury of waiting. If I was paid 2 days ago, and my rent was to be paid today, I would have problems.
Then there's the other volatility issues; everyone knows roughly what a dollar is worth. But last year, a bitcoin would buy a pizza; next year it could buy a used car. Last week, a bitcoin was worth 70% of what it is this week; am I supposed to update all the price tags in my shop for that? And am I expected to constantly check exchanges to ensure I'm not being ripped off when I go to the grocery? That's impractical. 
So, quite honestly, bitcoin has quite a ways to go before the Average Joe picks it up as anything other than a penny stock for their retirement portfolio.

If you have to ask, the answer is don't buy in. And definitely don't take the advice of random internet strangers with a vested interest.

Of course it's because of bitcoin. If I were a conman, bitcoiners are exactly the market I would target. 
Seriously, all you need to do it extol the values of bitcoin ad nauseum, and idiots here suddenly trust you all of a sudden. If I were a conman, I would have headed straight for the ASIC market, followed up by the 'secure bitcoin storage' market. It's a bunch of chumps whose starry-eyed hallucinations of their future millions lead them to do all-or-nothing gambles without a second thought. It's the perfect mark.

^This is why I give Bitcoin at most 5 years to live. People talk about "market corrections" and that kind of crap when it drops 25% in one day. Those aren't "market corrections." The true market is how much bitcoin is used as a currency to actually make purchases; which is a tiny drop in the bucket. 99% of Bitcoin's current value is pure speculation entirely unhitched from its value as a currency; and that disparity only gets larger as the price continues to rise. It's an asset bubble whose monumentally precipitous "market correction" will quite likely end the entire system when the price drops by over 90%. That's deflation economics, and why countries avoid it like the plague.

It always takes an external factor. Even the tulips did: 
"The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague."

"Crash on the horizon?" More like crash is half-way into the mooring procedures. 
No one can, with a straight face, tell me that there is any logical reason aside from an imminent April-like crash for the price to have hiked 50% in a mere 3 days.

More importantly, these phases are zero-sum games. Every penny gained on the way up is at the expense of those on the way down. Which means you either got in and got out early, or you lose money. By the time it looks like there's big money to be made is the worst time to buy in, because by that point, the early winners are leaving with your money. 
That fact that you want to buy in there says two things about you:
1. You're a human
2. You're an amateur
Neither of these things will work in your favor. When it comes to speculating, it all comes down to a simple question: do you think you are smarter than the guys with their trading AIs? And the answer from anyone should be 'No.' That's all it comes down to for zero-sum games found in bubble economics.

This. Quite frankly, if you don't think the government will catch you, you're an idiot. You might get away with it for a year; you might get away with it for a decade. And when they do, they will dig up every cent in back taxes you owe, and then add fines and possible jail time onto that. This is the era of AI and big data. Every transaction you make in bitcoin is recorded and disseminated through the network. It's "completely anonymous;" but then, so was TOR. All you need to find someone is the data which is being broadcast with every transaction and a mediocre knowledge of the network, processed by some high-throughput analysis servers. And the analysis methods and computational power applied to them will only increase as the years go by.
