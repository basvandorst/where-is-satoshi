It feels more like "Aren't you glad I held a lit match under your smoke detector for a few seconds to prove that your smoke detectors weren't working?" 
They're only doing it for a day, and a slightly larger-than-normal transaction fee will give your transaction a higher priority than this nonsense and it'll be included in the next block without issue. It might be a bit useless or a pain in the ass, but it's not the same as burning someone's house down to the ground.

Run it through a VPN or Tor. Or run a node that doesn't hold any bitcoins. I have a node running on my HTPC just to help the network, and it has no bitcoins on it, so there's nothing to steal from it except a few terabytes of pirated movies.

Not quite. If a webpage is sent over http instead of https, then anyone in between you and the server can change anything on the page before it gets to you. 
Therefore, if you go to johnsmithsblog.com and he has a publicly displayed bitcoin address, anybody you can control the connection between your computer and his server can change that bitcoin address. So it'll still say "To donate to John Smith, send bitcoins to 1Example...", but anyone in the middle of the connection can change the address to an address of their own, effectively stealing your donation. 
If the website serves up pages over https, this can't happen. With https, data is encrypted between the server and your computer, so nobody can even read the data, let alone change it without your browser knowing something's wrong and alerting you.

I've never even heard of Petamine until just now. My mining hardware, which is all mining for p2pool, is getting old and will be unprofitable in a few months. I've been planning to buy new hardware and upgrade the mining rig, but Petamine looks promising and interesting. I'll definitely be putting at least a little bit of money into it, but there's a chance I'll use it to completely replace the whole rig.

Do you know what "for no reason" means? 
There is clearly a reason. The Russian government prohibiting access to the website for Russian customers. 
Like they literally wrote the reason in plain English right there. Did you read the first sentence of what you copied and pasted? 
They're temporarily restricting access for Russian users because clearly the Russian government isn't okay with Russians being able to access their website. Bitstamp does't want to deal with confused Russians asking "I was able to access your website yesterday but it's blocked now, how will I get my bitcoins?". There's nothing unprofessional about blocking people who are already blocked. 


Look at that! They're very clearly saying that they don't want their customers to get in trouble, so they're temporarily stopping them from using a website that might get them in trouble! Wow! They're explaining the exact reason right there! 


Except that Russia is already banning Russian customers from accessing the site, which is a pretty solid reason. 
Get your panties out of a bunch. I'm no fan of Bitstamp and I moved all my trading to Coinbase over a year ago, but Bitstamp did nothing wrong here. They have a very solid reason to temporarily halt business in Russia. I'm sure they make plenty of money from their Russian customers and I'm sure they want them back soon. 
**TL;DR: No. They have a perfectly good reason, and they wrote it for you right there. You copied and pasted their reasoning without even reading it because you want to bust out your pitchforks.**

I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin, and I currently hold about 90% of my wealth in bitcoins, but I spent a while learning about it to figure out how it could be legal *or* right because of basically the same reason that the commenter in OP's post did. If Bitcoin were just printing regular money, I wouldn't do it, not because printing regular money isn't legal, but because it also isn't right. It's bad for the economy. It's a bad idea to print counterfeit money in general. It's not only illegal, but it's just a wrong thing to do. 
Bitcoin is awesome, but the problem isn't that this person is a slave to the machine or not a free man. The problem is that this person thinks that Bitcoin is so much like the dollar that creating your own bitcoins is illegal. We need to work toward better educating the public on how Bitcoin works and why it's legal and safe and right, rather than calling someone a slave for wondering why it could be wrong to print your own money without understanding that Bitcoin works differently from the dollar.

I know. I'm a horrible fool. 
However, I had almost no money when I started in with Bitcoin, since I was only about 16 (I'm 21 now, so this was when Bitcoin was a little over a year old). I began mining back when few people (even within the tech circles) had ever heard of Bitcoin. Nearly all of my current wealth was made from mining bitcoins, mostly from back when I started. I started mining back when mining on a CPU was possible, and soon started mining on a decent ATI GPU, which could mine about 0.4 BTC per day. Back then, that was worth less than a dollar (today it's nearly $120), but it was still exciting, so I saved those bitcoins and kept mining just because it was fun to see my computer printing money, however small it was. 
If I pull out even 10% of my bitcoins and put it in the bank, my bank is going to contact me for lots of questioning. They once called me up asking about the weird wire transfers from Slovakia (from Bitstamp) and I tried to explain that they were from a Bitcoin exchange, and they'd never heard of Bitcoin before, and they kept asking if it had to do with anything illegal. Now I just trade large chunks in person for cash and spend that. I have a few thousand in the bank for if I ever need dollars right away, and I put chunks of a few hundred in the bank every month or so to pay for my car insurance and college tuition. That's really all I use my bank for, and I only use it because my insurance company and college don't accept cash (or bitcoins, yet!). 
If I lose it all, then that really sucks. But, financially, I'll be back where I was five years ago, but a few thousand dollars richer (from what I currently have stored in the bank). And I'll still leave with a great story and a lot of lessons learned, and much more technical knowledge (I learned how to build computers, and learned lots of programming and networking skills, which are useful for someone majoring in computer science), and I'll have a lot more knowledge about economics (I've learned more about economics from trading bitcoins than I did from my high school econ class, except for diversification; I guess I was sick that day!).

That is oddly adorable. Among running "The Amazon.com of Illegal Drugs", commissioning hits on blackmailers, and getting death threats, he's still bumbling around in a tree trying to clean up the local park and meeting with girls on okc. That's... That's just so oddly adorable. 
I'm not saying that he's the culprit or not; I don't know enough about the case to make an informed decision (I don't think anyone ever will, but I stopped paying attention to the case about two weeks after we learned about Ulbricht, so I'm particularly ill-informed). But if he wrote all this, then the fact that he's logging everything from executions to dates is just so... adorable, I guess? That's kinda the word I'm looking for. It's not proof that he's innocent *or* guilty, but it's just such peculiar behavior. From what I read about him when we first learned about him, it sounds like he's the most bohemian guy on earth. Rakes in millions of dollars running an online drug exchange, orders executions of his enemies, and meanwhile lives a perfectly normal life and spent barely a single penny on anything other than the site. It's like Hannah Montana with drugs and murder! 
I love how one of the files in that Windows Explorer screenshot is a file called "NetWorthCalculator.ods". He's also got a file called "emergency" and another called "someday.txt". I'd kill to see what's in those. I'd also love to see what he wrote on his okc page. Regardless of how guilty he is, he's a fascinating guy.

This is why I use multiple places to store my bitcoins. Some were saved to a paper wallet made with a Raspberry Pi with Bitcoind, some were saved in a wallet in Electrum, some were saved in an old Android phone with the Bitcoin Wallet app and backed up to Gmail, etc. It's unlikely that multiple places can be broken into.

The Wikipedia article on Bitcoin uses the word "cryptography" six times. It uses the word "encryption" zero times. There isn't any encryption in Bitcoin.

I used to sell BTC at the Bitcoin Center in NYC on Broad St. Now I do it all online, but it used to be really handy (especially since I'm in NYC several times a week) to go there with 10 bitcoins on my phone and walk out with a shitload of cash, with lots of convenience and absolutely no fees (except transportation because I live in NJ, but I was already in Manhattan for other reasons most of the days that I went there, so there weren't any fees). I just had to send some coins from my computer to my phone before I left the house. Trading there was really easy because I could just count someone's cash and scan the QR code on their phone with my phone and tap send! Each trade was done in less than 30 seconds. There were always plenty of people trading there each Monday and Thursday so I could get pretty much any amount of money that I needed as long as I stayed for a little while. I once walked out of there with $20,000 in cash after only half an hour of trading. 
Being able to buy and sell Bitcoins in person is really useful, so it's going to make a lot of people leave NYC to trade in NJ (and maybe Connecticut, but that's a bit of a hike from NYC). I would bet that parts of NJ that are easy to access from Manhattan and the other boroughs (especially Jersey City and Hoboken) will become big for trading Bitcoins if NY keeps this law in place. It's very very easy to take the path into NJ (and just $5 round-trip!). I wouldn't be surprised if someone opens up a dedicated Bitcoin evangelism center (like the Bitcoin Center in NYC on Broad) somewhere like JC or Hoboken.

I think at least part of the problem is that Krugman doesn't totally understand technology in general, and the Internet specifically. In 1998, he said "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."
He understands money, but he doesn't understand technology. When the two combine, it's hard for him to grasp.

I was in a large room with usually about 50-75-ish people in it. If someone were to try to take my money, I could just start screaming and get everyone's attention. I also did it all the way in the back of the room, as far as possible from the main entrance. The only other way out is the emergency exit (which was also usually blocked by people chatting). 
We'd agree on the amount of cash they'd give me and the amount of bitcoin I'd give them before we start any trade. 
The person with the cash would put their pile of cash on the table, I'd count it in front of them so that I know I'm getting what we agreed on, and then they'd put their QR code on their phone screen. I'd scan it with my phone and put in the exact amount we agreed on. I'd usually pull the cash away from them before hitting send (not putting it in my pocket, but keeping it out of their reach), and then hit send in the bitcoin app on my phone. A few seconds later, their phone would make a noise and they'd say "yup, got it, thanks man!", and I'd pocket the cash and head home (or wander around with a drink in my hand and talk bitcoin with strangers). 
With cash, assuming that both traders can't run out of the room quickly, there's really no need for escrow, because it's pretty hard for the other person to leave without completing the transaction. The fact that I could just scream and get the attention of 50+ people who were blocking the other guy from leaving (and the same with them; I can't get away easily either) made it a surprisingly secure environment. Plus it's along Wall St, which is a *very* secure place post 9/11 and the economic recession. Security is fucking everywhere. You can't even drive on Wall St or any of the streets it touches without having your entire car scanned by an X-ray machine. If you're going to trade bitcoins anywhere, Wall Street's a pretty safe place. 
Plus it's the Bitcoin Center, so there were trades like this happening all the time on trading day (which was every Monday and Thursday evening back when I did it). 
(Edit: usually when I traded over $1000 in one individual trade, we'd have someone who works or volunteers at the Bitcoin center help with the transaction and hold the cash in their hand, just to make sure that nobody does anything sketchy. So for really large transactions, there was optional pretty secure escrow.)

I doubt that the person who's really Satoshi has ever been a public figure in any way, and I think he/she has remained quiet for their whole life. But if Satoshi is a (semi-)public figure, he's Hal Finney. 
He's the closest thing we have (well, had, such a sad death out of its time) to someone smart enough, and familiar enough with cryptography, to create such a complicated cryptosystem. 
Most of the other people we point fingers at as being The Inventor Of Bitcoin (Nick Szabo comes up a lot; people also point fingers at Gavin, Luke-Jr, Jeff Garzik, Pieter Wuille, and a few of the other folks who've made serious post-creation contributions to Bitcoin Core; investigators have pointed at Michael Clear, Dorian Nakamoto, Shinichi Mochizuki, and even Ross Ulbricht (the Silk Road guy); for more, see [this]( Hal Finney seems more likely than most. Plus, he's literally the first person to admit to using Bitcoin. He was one half (possibly both halves) of the first Bitcoin transaction. 
Personally, I still don't think Hal Finney is Satoshi. I don't think we'll ever hear Satoshi's real name; I bet Satoshi never made any serious contributions to cryptography outside of Bitcoin, and if Satoshi hasn't come out by now, we should hold our breath for a big announcement. We're almost definitely never going to find out the true identity of Satoshi. But if there's anyone out there (who we know of) who could possibly be Satoshi's true identity, I bet it'd be Hal Finney.

Satoshi cryptographically signed all his messages and posts.

If someone says that they're Satoshi and signs the message with Satoshi's signature, then they're (probably) really him.

It's not meant for mining addresses until you find one with bitcoins in it (although technically you could do that; it would take quadrillions of years to do, even if you had all the computing power on earth, but you could do that). It's just meant for making addresses with a cool pattern. It'd be cool if I could make my Bitcoin address start with "1JerkingItWithJesus", although that's probably too long to find quickly. It wouldn't take more than a few hours to find an address starting with a short first name. Having "1David" as the beginning of a Bitcoin address would be pretty cool.

It was hard enough to read through all the **bold** and *italics* and UPPERCASE, but what made me need to stop reading was 


Once he said "sheeple", it became pretty clear that this guy has no idea what he's talking about. The whole point of Bitcoin is that it isn't controlled by anyone who can control the "sheeple" and their money. 
And using the word "sheeple" just makes you sound like an idiot. 
It also seems as if he's not aware that Bitcoin can't simply be "shut down". It literally can't happen. Use of Bitcoin has nothing to do with your rights. As long as people have Internet access, they can use Bitcoin. Laws can't shut down the network. The network can't go down unless you take down every single computer connected to the network, which basically means shutting down the entire Internet forever. If Denninger were smart at all, he'd read a bit more about how Bitcoin and the Internet work before bashing the crap out of it. 
It also looks like he forgot that there are actually people who live outside of America and who aren't subject to America's laws. There's no way that America can make a law to control every person on earth. So there's nothing that the US can do to make Bitcoin just be "gone" like Denninger says it is. There are actually people who don't live in the US and who don't have to follow the US' laws.

Looking through people's comment history and checking to see if they're a sock account is a better way to spend your time than complaining about a $4 app and obviously falsely accusing someone of using sock accounts.

Agreed. I used to swear by my iPod touch. It went everywhere with me for just over a year. I thought iOS could do everything that Android could do and far more. (In my defense, I wasn't really wrong about that. Back when I got it, Android was still pretty far behind where it is now. I don't know much about the exact history of Android because I only got my Nexus 4 back in April, but I bought my iPod touch at least a year before Project Butter. I took a quick look at a few Android devices and just said "nah, looks like crap".) 
But the functionality and everything-works-together attitude of Android blows me away every day. When someone sends me a link to something on reddit, it opens in a reddit app instead of a browser. It just makes sense, but for some reason people are content with having it open in a browser even when they have a perfectly-working reddit app right there! Android has a completely usable filesystem that I have total control over. I can organize movies and TV shows in it as much as I want. I can send them to my phone through QRSend or Bittorrent Sync (both of which are absolutely incredible on Android; QRSend doesn't exist on iOS, and BTSync has very limited functionality on iOS). 
And the fact that there aren't any app restrictions except for "please don't do anything illegal" is pretty awesome. My girlfriend likes the old Pokemon games, which I've never played before. I wanted to try it out, but I don't have any old Nintendo handhelds, so I just asked her what her favorite Pokemon game was, downloaded an emulator for it and a rom from a moderately-sketchy-looking website, and about two minutes later, I was playing it. I also have the incredible Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on my phone. It's not the same as being a little kid and sitting on the floor in front of the TV with an N64 controller, but I'll never have an N64 in my doctor's waiting room or on a train. I can bring everything I want with me, any time I want. 
And porn apps. There are porn apps. iOS doesn't have any porn. Android doesn't have it in the Play Store, but the porn is there. It's not that useful for me because I'm not the kind of person who uses porn outside of my house, but... It's there. 
If all you need is something that makes you look rich and that you can use for simple texting/Facebook/Twitter, then an iPhone is really all you need. But if you want a real computer in your pocket, I don't see how anyone can look at anything other than Android as the only serious choice. You can't even connect a bluetooth keyboard to an iPhone or iPod touch. 
I've even noticed that iOS is the only major operating system that doesn't support multiple users. My Nexus 4 running ParanoidAndroid 3+ supports multiple user accounts, so I can keep regular stuff in one user account, and have another for stuff I *really* don't want people to see, and another with games and things that I'm okay with people using if they want to borrow my phone. 
And, of course, the aforementioned complete support for Bitcoin is an enormous plus. I always have ~$150 worth of bitcoins with me, and I'm always ready to send and receive bitcoins. 
The fact that my Nexus 4 cost about half the price that an unlocked iPhone costs kinda negates any remaining issues that Android has. 
I can ramble on about this stuff all day. Maybe someday iOS will reach a level of functionality that Android has, but not for a very long time. 
TL;DR Android is pretty awesome. It's truly a "computer in the palm of your hand". Sorry for wall of text.

Maybe Apple should change those guidelines so that they aren't anti-Bitcoin. 


That's why everyone here is loving Android and saying that Android is better. There are no stupid rules like that. The rules for Apple's App Store are "Don't do anything we don't like or that doesn't help us rake in even more money." The rules for the Google Play Store are "Don't do anything illegal or adult in our store, and even if you want to do something illegal or adult, you can just download the .apk file from someone else's website and install it on your phone if you really want it."

Bitcoin itself is a payment method. Being able to pay with Bitcoin for their services is a feature that Dropbox should include so that I can use my (and many other people's) payment method of choice.   


The fact that you're assuming that all of my income and savings are in dollars instead of Bitcoin tells me that you're a tool. Besides, I'd prefer to spend my money without governments and other corporations tracking what I spend my money on. I don't like the NSA/MasterCard/Visa/etc being able totrack and sell my private financial history to others without my consent. Bitcoin is better than fiat for privacy, and I don't like having my financial information made public. 


If the most requested feature that Dropbox's users wanted was to be able to pay in envelopes of rupees, it'd be kinda stupid for Dropbox to not let users do that. Otherwise their users would just use a similar service that let's users pay in envelopes of rupees, since all of these cloud storage services are exactly the same and Dropbox doesn't offer any advantages. And your envelopes-of-rupees analogy is kinda stupid since accepting envelopes of rupees world be kinda difficult to set up. Implementing Bitcoin support would be incredibly easy. It's not like Dropbox has any employees who know anything about programming... 


Well you're the one who went on the Bitcoin subreddit to call people tools for wanting to use Bitcoin, so I'm not sure why you're calling *me* childish. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:20:20


I think you're getting caught up in semantics. Nobody even cares whether Apple is anti-Bitcoin. All we care about is the fact that Apple keeps banning any apps that are used to send and receive bitcoins. They need to change their rules and keep up with the changing times, or I'll move to someone who can keep up with me. Actively banning Bitcoin apps is scaring a lot of Bitcoin users from iOS. 


That app wasn't a virus. A virus has to take advantage of security flaws in the operating system and specifically act against the expressed wishes of the user. That app asked for location information when it was installed. You should look at the listed permissions that the app asks for before you install it. It just kinda makes sense. 


Apparently, "we don't like companies that stop us from using our property the way we want to" is invalid and bullshit. It's not bullshit that Apple goes out of their way to stop people from spending bitcoins on their devices. If Bitcoin goes against their policies, then they should change their policies, or they'll just be shutting out Bitcoin.

They've been able to remotely delete apps from iOS devices since the first iPhone came out. Apple confirmed it themselves after a hacker discovered the function, called a "kill switch", shortly after people began jailbreaking the device. 
They've never actually used it before. But it's there.

We're not pissed because Dropbox doesn't offer Bitcoin support. We're pissed because it was completely ignored for several years, and then they removed it from the site entirely so that they wouldn't have to answer to the Bitcoin community. 
And yes, most of us *do* feel that spending Bitcoin is better than spending fiat money, and we would prefer to spend our bitcoins instead of dollars. If Company A chooses to support Bitcoin and Company B doesn't, guess who's going to get our money.

What are you even talking about? The private keys for your bitcoins are stored on the device, and the bitcoins themselves are stored in the block chain, which exists essentially everywhere. If you're using bitcoin, then you know *exactly* where your bitcoins and your private keys are at all times. 


Since your wallet is stored on your device, there are literally zero routers between you and your wallet.

There's no jailbreak for iOS 7. Apple doesn't sell non-iOS7 devices. What would you suggest people do if they just bought an iPhone and can't jailbreak it? If you buy an Android phone right now, you can use Bitcoin wallet apps on day 1. With iOS, you'll have to wait until there's a jailbreak, which won't happen for a while.

Well, Instagram also isn't making any money that way, so that's a pretty silly analogy. They've raised funding from angel investors, but they haven't actually brought in any money through their product yet. So that's a silly comparison. 


Boy, that escalated quickly. You *hate* me, a person you've literally never met before, just because I think that people should be allowed to put a price on something they spent time on? Besides, it's not just his time. That $3.99 helps pay for the education he got to learn how to program, and it pays for the energy he spent on making it, and it pays for the heating and air conditioning for the room he was working in, and it pays for the computer he programmed it on, and it pays for the Apple developer account he had to buy to sell the app. 
It's not just the developer's time that matters. There's more to it than that. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:14:51
Sounds depressingly accurate. It doesn't help those who want to spend bitcoins from their phone, but it's still accurate.

How do you manage to not charge users while still making money? That's literally not possible. Unless you're implementing ads, which still doesn't count because the people paying to make those ads are still using your product. 
Besides, how would OP even put an ad in this app if the whole point is that the price is displayed on the home screen? There's no place to put the ad! 
Regardless, if someone sees a $3.99 app as a rip off, then they're saying that the time this developer spent making this app is worthless.

So when Apple got half a dozen bitcoin wallet apps submitted to the App Store, they just removed them all instead of saying "hey, maybe we should consider changing our guidelines". That's what it is. 
Times change. Technology changes. Apple needs to amend their guidelines to allow Bitcoin wallet apps, or people will move to competing products. It's not like Apple is somehow incapable of changing their own guidelines. They refuse to change them because the one guy at Apple who would've dared to keep up with the times is dead. 
Imagine what Bitcoin on iOS would be like if Steve Jobs were still alive. A way to send money around the world in seconds over the Internet with almost no fees and no central servers? He'd pounce on that in milliseconds. Bitcoin would be *the* way to buy things with Apple's products. But instead, they're choosing to be left behind in the dust while other platforms and services thrive with Bitcoin. 
The App Store launched about six months before Bitcoin was introduced. Obviously Apple didn't consider an invention that hadn't been invented yet when they wrote the App Store guidelines. But perhaps it's time for some changes to be made to their guidelines, so that they don't block out useful apps. 
Regardless, there's one platform that doesn't allow Bitcoin apps, and there's one that does. If being able to spend bitcoins is important, then there's an obvious superior choice among the two. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:13:49
Well I'm actually pretty well off, but I'm not a bragging asshole about it. And obviously you're not explaining any other way to make money because there's isn't another way to make money from this app. Since advertising isn't an option with this app, the only choice is to charge for it. 
What are these two other companies that you've created? I'm pretty sure you're lying about having created any Bitcoin companies since you still haven't provided any evidence that you have.

For such a useful app, I've only heard of it once, back when I originally got my first Android device (my Nexus 4 back in April of this year). It's a great app. I'm surprised it's so rarely heard of. 
QRSend + BTSync + my computer is set up to automatically torrent (or usenet) my favourite TV shows = my favourite TV shows are super easy to move to my phone in the morning to watch on the train to school. It's so easy. It only takes a few moments to get used to QRSend, and it's totally worth every second you spend learning how to use it. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:38:35
So the developer decided to make an account 9 months ago, comment all over the place, and then use that account as a sockpuppet? Sounds likely. 
Or... I'm a normal person who thinks that people shouldn't be doing work just out of the goodness of their hearts and should actually be paid for their work. Nah, that can't be it! Who would ever suggest that paying a fair price for a decent product is a good idea? What madness! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:37:49

How is Facebook even slightly related to OP's app? When Facebook started, they covered the side of the website in targeted ads to make money to pay for the server. OP can't do that. Is he supposed to stuff a little tiny ad inside the little icon next to the exchange rate? 
You're literally complaining over having to pay *almost nothing* (seriously, it's $4. I pay more than that for an average lunch) for what appears to be a pretty good app that does stuff that other apps can't do. Not everything can be free. This guy worked hard making a cool app, and he deserves to be paid for his hard work. If you think it's so easy to make that app and build servers for it, do it yourself and make it free for everyone else. Until then, go be a troll someplace else.

After Silk Road shut down, the price of one bitcoin fell and then rose back over its pre-SR-shutdown price, all in less than two weeks. 
SR used to be a huge part of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin probably wouldn't have taken off as fast as it did without SR, but it's silly to say that SR was very important to Bitcoin during its last few days.

It's there. I just bought an Arduino Starter Kit with bitcoins. I couldn't find the "Pay in bitcoins" option until checkout, but it's there. 
I couldn't find any other information about it, which means that they haven't updated the rest of the site to show that they now accept bitcoins. Hopefully sometime soon they'll put in a currency switcher that includes Bitcoin and put a bitcoin logo next to the credit card logos and PayPal logo. I also couldn't find anything there about donations. But bitcoin payments *do* work! You just won't see anything about it until checkout.

You literally said the words "Should be free" in the [first comment you made here]( You're clearly lying about making millions if you're not smart enough to remember what you said four hours ago. 
But on the plus side, I suppose I managed to help you change your mind about free apps! Before you met me, you insisted that the app should be free, but now you're saying that it doesn't need to be free! I suppose this means that I helped you change your mind! I'm so glad I helped you realize that you were wrong all along!

That's true, but if John-Garrison also paid for it in bitcoins, then the value of those bitcoins that he (assuming male because username) spent on the miner would also rise just as much as the $1.40 he's mining from it right now. He could have kept those bitcoins and not spent them on anything, and they'd be worth more than the device will mine in the foreseeable future.
