Lots of people take me seriously. Just not you, it seems.

But is it useful to you, if no-one else values bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:52:04
Do you realize that I don't particularly care what they think?

Hmm. I'm a little skeptical about drawing conclusions from this blog, so let's crunch some numbers.
Germany has [33,509]( kilometers of railroad track, a population of [80,621,788]( and an area of [357,168]( square kilometers. That means it has 42 centimeters of railway track for every citizen, and 94 meters of railway track for every square kilometer of area.
The USA, on the other hand, has [228,218]( kilometers of railroad track, a population of [316,128,839]( and an area of [9,857,000]( square kilometers. That means it has 72 centimeters of railway track for every citizen (better than Germany!), but only 23 meters of railway track for every square kilometer of area (worse than germany).
So, America does better on a per-capita basis in railways but worse on a per-km^2 basis.
[Blurry math here.](

Most of them, sure.

It's always funny when people try to compare an anarchistic developing country to developed statist countries, rather than looking for a meaningful comparison: like anarchistic developing countries vs statist developing countries.
But regardless, pre- or post- government collapse? I only ask because living conditions took an upturn after the state fell:


ces of state collapse for a country that
existed under the rule of a vampire state.
**Far from chaos and economic collapse, we find
that Somalia is generally doing better than when it had a state.** Basic economic order is
possible because of the existence of a common law dispute resolution system and a non-state monetary system. On that foundation
we find that urban business and commercial
activity is possible and that the pastoral
sector has expanded.
This paper’s main
contribution to the literature on Somalia’s living standards has been to compare them to
those of 42 other sub-Saharan African countries both before and after the collapse of the
national government. **We find that Somalia’s
living standards have
improved generally
and that they compare relatively favorably with many existing African states.
Importantly, we find that Somali living standards have often improved, not just in
absolute terms, but also relative to other African countries since the collapse of the
Somali central government.**
-[Somalia After State Collapse: Chaos or Improvement?](


not only fail to add to social welfare, but can actually reduce welfare below its level under statelessness.
Such was the case with Somalia’s government, which did more harm to its citizens than good. **The government’s collapse and subsequent emergence of statelessness opened the opportunity for Somali progress.**
This paper investigates the impact of anarchy on Somali development. The data suggest that while the state
of this development remains low, **on nearly all of 18 key indicators that allow pre- and post-stateless welfare
comparisons, Somalis are better off under anarchy than they were under government.** Renewed vibrancy in
critical sectors of Somalia’s economy and public goods in the absence of a predatory state are responsible
for this improvement.

Of course, this is far from a conclusive proof for the efficacy of anarchism, or an indictment of statism everywhere, but it definitely shows that you're full of shit.

If you're looking for more than a one-line response, you might take a look at [The Privatization of Roads &amp; Highways]( by Walter Block.

For what end? Just curious.

Do you have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe that government is corrupt and harmful?
Are all anarchists, of all stripes, conspiracy theorists who believe in the illuminati?

So *we're* obligated to pay for the services *you* want? Ok there buddy.

You're asking for examples of successful stateless societies, and I agree that there probably aren't any examples that you would accept as such.
But do we need historical examples of a thing for it to be possible? There was once a time period where there were no records of stable democracies, for example.


Let's hear it.

You can't say that you're "choosing your mafia" when you have very little choice at all.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:49:37


You're not choosing a mafia even under democracy. There's always the non-negligible chance that you'll end up in the minority vote. And either way, in the large nations of today, your vote has such a tiny impact on the result of the election that it would almost certainly end up the same whether you bothered to vote or not.
Or we could consider the huge number of people who aren't directly elected but hold political power.

You're generalizing between libertarians and ancaps.


I'm pretty sure feudalism involved a form of government.


Are you trying to disprove his argument or just demean him?
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:02:36
How patronizing.

Do you think if something hasn't existed, it can never exist?

I agree with the rest of your comment, but can you explain your logic here?
