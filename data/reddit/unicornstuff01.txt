Just want to add: When Paxful has already made a 2nd school in rwanda only using Bitcoins...

There's a lot of opportunities in p2p, there are also a lot of good deals in Paxful

Peer to peer has the upper hand in this bear market, not unlike any other exchanges, One thing that I could be doing is selling my BTC for Amazon Gift cards with a High profit. I could tell that this would be a big Volume for all Peer-to-peer Marketplace.

The Gift card market is really big! And the Bitcoin volume it generates is massive, It's better to get good deals in peer to peer marketplace because of sellers who you can be friends with rather than a big corporation who treats you like a revenue

Peer-to-peer marketplaces has already created a way to buy and sell Starbucks gift cards using Bitcoins, so in a way, Starbucks Accept Bitcoins too, might not be directly but the essence is there.

I can actually see why growth is possible with peer-to-peer marketplaces. Look at Steam for example. They removed their payment using cryptocurrency and now the bitcoin community works around this by buying and selling Bitcoins for Steam gift cards. You can buy almost everything with bitcoins and you double that opportunity through these escrow protected p2p marketplaces.

I’ve heard of some using this as a business, they would use escrow to buy starbucks gift cards in exchange of bitcoins.

This is really the time for third world countries, it should also spread around the world, Africa already started it, the rest of the world needs to be educated about crypto.
