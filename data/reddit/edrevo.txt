OKPay is available worldwide

Take a look at  Disclaimer: I'm one of the guys behind the project :)

Not rude at all :) We are planning on using the pre-existing financial entities to transfer the money between the users. We want our first release to have support for [OkPay]( so OkPay users can exchange bitcoins. The fiat money would be transferred from one OkPay account to another, and the bitcoin exchange would happen through the schema we have defined (but it would happen between peers, so no central authority needs to exist). In further releases, we could extend support to other like Dwolla or others.
In any case, if the government wasn't happy about the exchange, they would have no server to close to stop the exchange from being online.

The dollars are being sent through a payment processor that supports non-reversible payments. The first release will support OKPay. Check out the [FAQ](

Hi! I'm one of the devs behind the project. We have been heavily based our algorithm on the link you are providing, but the wifi scenario really doesn't work without trust: the wifi provider can accept the first payment for the wifi service and then refuse to provide wifi access (free btc!). Conversely, the customer can accept the first wifi time slot and then refuse to pay for it (free wifi!).
We are basically mixing this strategy with a deposit that doesn't get unlocked until the end of the transaction to force users to cooperate and be fair.

The first release will work with OkPay, so the client software will use OkPay's API to send the fiat from one account to the other.

Hi, I'm one of the devs behind the project. The fiat transfer will happen through payment processors that offer non-reversible payments like OKPay and PerfectMoney.
We need to revamp the website because this question keep popping up and we aren't explaining it clearly with the current content.

Hi! I'm one of the devs involved in the project. We are aware this is a big issue and we are working on ways to mitigate this. We aim for this to be a non-issue for new buyers and we're thinking about different strategies to mitigate this.

I'm one of the devs behind the project. I agree that right now there's not much to share in term of deliverables. We have been thinking hard about how to solve the distributed currency transfer and the distributed continuous double auction to match buy and sell orders (which we still need to document).
I invite you to check out [our code]( and our [Github wiki]( which has more in-depth and technical information than the website. We are working hard on delivering a usable alpha, it's just that we haven't finished coding and testing yet :)

The fiat transfer would happen through payment processors like OkPay, so 100 1€ transfers would actually happen quite quickly (and the transfers cannot be reversed like in Visa, so that's also good).
We really need to make that explicit in the webpage. I don't think it is clear enough right now.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:54:36
Not yet! We're surprised to have received attention this early in the project. We are working hard to provide a usable alpha. We'll keep you posted!

There's no need for a one-hour wait in between steps. Steps can be performed as fast as the payment processor can send the funds from one account to the other.
Crypto-to-crypto is definitely an interesting idea we might explore down the road, but right now we are focused on the crytpo-to-fiat space since it seems to be the biggest pain point in the bitcoin ecosystem.

That is correct. You can check our the transaction definitions ( if you're interested in the detail of how the transactions are specified.

The security deposit is left as an unused amount in the transaction. For example, the buyer could add 1mBTC to the transacton and the seller could add 1.001 BTC to the transaction. The total input amount would be 1.002BTC, and yet the total output amount (until the whole exchange has been completed, in which case the deposits are returned) would be 1BTC.
This means that if the exchange doesn't end well becuase either the buyer or the seller is irrational and wants to loose money, then the 2mBTC that were used as deposit will be part of the mining fee for the miner that confirms the transaction.
