Mr Warren Buffett is afraid NOT because his wealth will disappear BUT because he would be wrong again (of not seeing the potential of this new technology) and lose face.

They are the billionaires for sure, but that doesn't mean they don't want more money. They play the game of money, and they enjoy it. The fact that they keep talking (down) about  is strange (if they don't really care about Bitcoin). Do one talk about something that one doesn't really care about? My view is that they have the interest to persuade people NOT to invest in Bitcoin. The fact that they are talking about Bitcoin shows that people in their circle might be showing an interest in Bitcoin and they want to change that by keep talking negatively about Bitcoin. This is just my theory. I might be wrong.

Yes, Mr Warren Buffett is afraid NOT because his wealth will disappear BUT because he would be wrong again (of not seeing the potential of this new technology) and lose face. I seriously think that he has grossly misunderstood Bitcoin. I don't blame him because I did the same. I also thought  is a scam until March 2018. Reading deeply about  and really understanding it changed everything for me.
Here are FACTS that I know after learning more about Bitcoin. 
1. Bitcoin network is NEVER down in the last 10 years since it was launched because it is a decentralized distributed computer network \[Ask yourself how many times your traditional bank networks have been down in the last 10 years?\]. It is like an autonomous bank running 24/7 without any centralized entity. \[I have completely lost my respect for Mr Warren Buffett after he compared Bitcoin to Tulip because Tulip is a perishable commodity without any value transfer network like Bitcoin. Let's ask him if he has ever read Satoshi's white paper? I have read it numerous times just to understand it deeply.
2. It is the BEST STORE OF VALUE because:
* Security: It is extremely secure \[NO BODY can touch your bitcoin as long as you keep your private key safe. Imagine, an ordinary guy like me getting the security of a top Swiss Bank to store my Bitcoin \[value\] and able to carry it with me everywhere and able to move it anywhere I want!\]
* Limited Supply: There will only ever be 21million Bitcoins. If the adoption continues, even a millionaire today cannot own 1Bitcoin. You are extremely lucky if you have managed to buy 1BTC and hold it now.
* Neutrality: Everyone can own Bitcoin regardless of your background (race, religion, political affiliations, nationality etc.). Once you own it, it's yours!
* Censorship resistant: You can transfer your bitcoin to anybody, anywhere.
* TRUST: Finally, it creates TRUST because of all those factors. The best moves Satoshi Nakamoto did was to remain anonymous and move away. Bitcoin has no leader and nobody own the Bitcoin network \[It means everybody can own it if you want. As an example, I am running Bitcoin core full node from my notebook computer because I want to contribute to the community and I treat the Bitcoin network as my network. You can do the same if you want. It is completely voluntary.\]
* What is the value of TRUST? PRICELESS!
3. Bitcoin is GLOBAL and completely digital native token \[Nobody can seize it NOT even the government because of this digital nature. As an example Gold can be   
seized\]. You can transfer your Bitcoin to anywhere around the world at a click of a button. Anyone in the world (including machines) can own it and spend it. As a   
global civilization, we need a global currency and store of value. My view is that Bitcoin is the ONE.
I believe in Bitcoin BECAUSE I understand its VALUE.  I am in for the long term. I hope I can earn more fiat money now because I want to buy more Bitcoin for me and my future generations. I want financial sovereignty and Bitcoin and Bitcoin network can give me (period)!
