Will I be able to search the lightning network ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:54:26
Would you be able to see a transaction on the block chain if it goes through lightening?

Just checked his BTC address listed below and guess what ... 0 balance.  Is he a true HODLER?  Now I’m questioning the teachings of our lord

about $8.50 - Totally ripped off that amazon seller 
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:57:50
The market is being played. It's a very obvious pattern seen throughout bitcoin life. The price plateaued so there was no money to be made so the big fish sold. They'll buy in at a lower price. Simple as that.  Nothing to do with xmas or any news. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:13:30
The way I see it is that it's a natural market cycle. No matter how smart we think we are it becomes unavoidable without big paradigm shifts. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:46:13
wait what?  Its totally real.  I can feel it with my own two hands!
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:05:05
it has that too

How will miners be incentivized in 5-10 years?  Won't the network die without peers supporting it?

Bitcoin: A better currency to make a better world

There are older people involved with BTC, but the age demographic suggests the average user is [32.7]( years old.  I'm all for more people accepting it, no matter their age.  
When I was 19 I had no interest in investing into my future outside of school.  I don't blame him, maybe you should throw a few bucks into a BTC account and give it to him as a gift.  It may spark his interest.

Bitcoin doesn’t need Tim Draper to succeed.  It’s a runaway train and we can only hope the US can keep up.

Im pretty sure it was just someone making it their "Username"
like coinbase.com/DonateHere is mine
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:15:49
They mention at the bottom "if amazon gets into the ring".  But so far I have not heard any substantial evidence that they're even interested 
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:29:31
You're 100% correct.  I clicked the QR code on   haha, I'm actually really relieved it was that simple. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:57:36
There is still a lot of negative sentiment on Bitcoin in the general public.  Thats why I don't mind Bitcoin moving a little slower than it has recently.  It needs to get a little more user friendly for the old people who comment on CNN/Fox to accept and not fear it.  
I do eventually see BTC being ubiquitous at least with the next generation of computer competent individuals, if we don't kill it by rushing it.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:13:29
I understand where you're coming from, but I happen to think there is some value in Bitcoin enthusiasts opinions.  Of course I am going to make up my own mind in the end.  
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:22:47
do you think it would be safer if I sent my BTC back to my coinbase account?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:14:19
I initially only read the community rules and didn't see anything prohibiting this type of post.  Sometimes I miss the stickies.  I have read it now.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:39:19
I guess this may increase Darkcoins appeal?
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:14:45
Price would increase quite a bit faster.  The day traders would be out most of their BTC and the holders would be left in the market. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:13:01
Downloading it right now.  Its still up.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:20:07
I think you're right on some levels.  Bitcoin does speak for itself with the Bitcoin literate.  But it does have a high barrier of entry, and a little bit of self promotion and explanation for what it is may help increase adoption. 
Of course since Bitcoin is decentralized there is no authority to adopt a slogan, unless its naturally accepted by the users... I'm not sure that Bitcoin will have a slogan anytime soon but I wouldn't mind it.  
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:23:47
How do we know this is secure?  I authorized the app, and am really enjoying the info. 
Edit: Found it on the Coinbase app section.  So at least they endorse it.

[I think you may be right](

genuinely funny comment by Shep.  Never really thought of him in a positive light before.... hmmm. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:52:28
It doesn't help that bitcoin was at an all time high coincidentally in the beginning of the year.   I'm very curious at what it'll be at around that time next year.

Technically apple is the world's largest company but I get your point
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:37:35
Looking forward to using your site
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:31:56
honest question here:  Are lightening transactions done off of the blockchain?  Is there a separate parallel network for lightening transactions?  Could i look up my account balance on the blockchain after doing a lightening transaction or will the values not add up?  Also, will the transactions ever be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain?
Edit: no answers, why not?  Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:53:07
Judging by your response, I assume you have been posted in there a time or two.

The anti-intellectual movement is real. BUT let's be completely honest here, people using sesquipedalian verbiage just for the sake of it when they could be far more efficient using common vernacular come off as douchey - just like I did just now.  
The smartest people can explain a complicated topic to a 5 year old with simple language, not try to talk above their head.

People are so thirsty for bitcoin price to bubble that the don’t realize forcing things like this is unnatural and doesn’t help at all in the end.  If you believe in the technology just give it time.

It's down since I made that comment. Don't get me wrong I hope it goes to the moon
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:14:38
This growth is not sustainable obviously.  When it crashes back down I hope it doesn't bum people out. Not a great time to buy. In a month I'm guessing it'll be ~ 300. Which is progress 
Edit: downvoted because people wont think the price will correct?  What goes up must come down, then go up again. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:19:10
Dude dont be dumb.  Obviously I'm a proponent of buying Bitcoin.  Ive been a hodler since 'nam.  There are just better times to buy bitcoin than others... Would you want to buy at the top of a price spike or after the price settles???  Bitcoin/blockchain are here to stay but it behaves like a market right now.  Ignoring that will lose you money.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:11:38
Dude it's a market. People get greedy and get burnt. Happens every time with big price swings. How much money is invested in start ups is irrelevant.  There's a price correction already ... 
@_date: 2016-10-11 23:31:46
Message me when you accept bitcoin and I'll buy one.
