Windows VM? Why the Mac audio adjust thing? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:24:40
^ this. I ended up having to use a pre-built mac virtual machine when I made my hackintosh.

This "virtual currency" talk is really starting to grind my gears. It's a real currency with real value that one can buy real goods with. It's a *digital* currency.

Sadly, I'm the same way. Everyone says I'm so negative or talk down about everything, but I just bring the negative possibilities to the table when nobody else is considering them. Plan for the worst, hope for the best.

Yup a VM worked fine to make the installation media, and even then you can just live boot that image if you wanted to work on a "real mac"

You have a very good way with natural speaking and presentation. You're going to go places.... Not gonna say where, but...... places.....

That makes more sense, doesn't it?

Bitcoin is a *digital* currency, not a virtual one.

Honestly, this isn't relavent to the sub. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:43:53

Mark Karpeles, head of Mt. GOX, allegedly stole the 650,000 missing Bitcoins from the site's users. This comic depicts him being very stupid in spending the coins as if they aren't his.

And why did you post this comment? We can see that you're OP...

Is the pro version a lifetime license for 2.0, also?

I got the same results in private mode proxied through another country. Also, the only bitcoin-related site I visit is the subreddit.

Nice work, detective. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:12:40
Although you are correct, you didn't need to be an ass about it..... 
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:25:20
Alright. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:23:25
EDIT: I used a UK proxy (I'm in US) in private mode as suggested.... Same top result.

Well that's good. Last I remember, they were blocking them.

I have this. I run two minecraft servers and many websites plus Kodi. You'll have no problems. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:12:20
Just move the money to another wallet and abandon.
