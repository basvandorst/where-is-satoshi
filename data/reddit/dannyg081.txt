But in Bitcoin life the farmer would send out the 3 horses again in the hope there will be 6 the next day. And the possibility is that not one horse returns ever and the sun will never break his leg which sends him to the army after all. Not trying to be a negative Nelly but you know, just saying.

Damn I have put in 100 on Bitcoin and Everytime the thing rises I am not seeing how many profit I made but instead I see how many I've lost compared to if I put in a 1000. I am like please don't go to the moon before I put in more money. 
I mean if my 100 Euro will become 1000 I will be crying in agony for not putting in more. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:46:55
Thanks for this explanation. I am planning on putting a thousand on btc and some hundreds on altcoins. At the moment I am reading up on a couple. I keep coming across info that states that Bitcoin will rise to a million. To me that is a bit far fetched but if I buy now and it becomes even a quarter of that it will be some nice profits. I don't believe Bitcoin will fall anytime soon so I think it is a safe bet. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:14:56
Lol no. I stick to the rule: Only invest in what you can miss. So on my next salary I will put a thousand in Bitcoin for hodl for some years. And will divide some hundreds to spread on some alt coins. And that 2000 will be my limit. My idea is to gain profit and buy more/other coins with that profit and not put more money in it than that 2000. Don't know if this strategy will work but buying different altcoins seems to have more potential than putting 1000 in one. Except for Bitcoin.

We're do you find these orders? Dumb question maybe but still asking.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:08:22
Serious question. Some believe Bitcoin will be worth a million dollar one day. But if nobody buys after it being about 14000, how would it go up from there ever?
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:02:23
I thought I should have added this bit it's the Netherlands. A good country with good rules. I know the story sounds like some fucked up dictator country and I didn't expect it either. I didn't knew how it worked either because I never had 50k before and I never knew someone who had. So this was all new to me too.
If my assets where to be above 20000 after a year I have to pay tax again (wealth tax is my best translation for how they call it). If it's more than 20000 after two years, again I had to pay this tax again, every year till it reaches below 20000.

Yes I agree. Well 
Making money for me is main thing.
Supporting the cause is a second benefit. I am a hypocrit. Sorry.but I am in it now and will not sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:28:34
100% agree! I admit I am only in for a 1000 but I am willing to lose every penny of it. Hell I might even buy another 1000 if it goes as low as 5. Somewhere I have the trust it will be better and goes up up up again.

There is also a fairly new documentary on Netflix which is now trending in my country. Don't know if this doc is new for the rest of the world though. The doc is basicly one big FUD and tells about the dgrox thing and interviews the guy going to prison. Also interviews a failed businessman who couldn't get a license for his bitcoin plans. You see him pulling the Bitcoin sticker of the wall with sad music. In the end one guy says he is leaving New York because "Bitcoin is dead here". Its a bit different but to new people watching it, it comes across ass a bunch of greedy idiots who first were rich thanks to supporting criminals in buying drugs and in the end they go to jail. So basicly that could be creating a loss in sells to I geuss.

Well I am not a idiot I am in it to make money too. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:52:11
Well I am hodling. Hodling on my money that is till it drops to 5k and than I will buy. And yes I will hodl again. But not till I am a millionaire but I would be happy with 100grand and have no regrets when I cash that out and I find out that if I would hodl longer I would have had a million. Maybe I'll even cash out at 50 grand and open up a small store for myself. I mad the mistake of being to greedy once and lost 17000€. Not with Bitcoin though that was something else.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:58:26
It's been said that 1000 investors control the Bitcoin. Wouldn't they keep repeating what already happens for the last 3/4 years. Make the price low and buy. Make the price high and sell? Maybe this is a stupid question but that is what I would do if I was part of that 1000 people. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:39:43
Week I think you perfectly describe what is going on now. People heard about the millionaire and want a piece of that action. In the end everybody does everything for his own good. If Bitcoin was the same but without the chance of making money, nobody would even make an effort to donate money to it. I have to say after watching a couple of documentary's about Bitcoin and the story behind it I have more of a connection with the "cause" part and the feeling I just want to be involved in contributing to a good cause. So you do have a good point. But I have to admit that when I started reading about it I put my money on it to make money in the first place. Now I slowly start caring about the whole thing more than just about the money.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:15:32
 There is a mining fee you pay for transactions. 
But I don't think it's that. What I think and noticed is that every site and wallet I look at has his own statistics of what the bitcoin price is at the moment. One is lower and one is higher. I use three different sites for example and every one of them has another current price of the cryptocoins. Correct me if I am wrong people who know more, but this could be the case.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:53:38

Well as the lawyer said they eventually have to give it to me. But the way the rules work it's rather pointless to have it at home. Every other bank works the same. The government's want their money and they will do everything to make sure they get it. And in the end there  is actualy no reason for me to want it in cash besides evading tax. If I want a car why not just transfer the money for example? And besides if I want to buy a car above 10.000, car companies are lawfully obliged to report that with the government. Because who in their right mind would walk around with 10 grand cash to buy a car?. I already knew how it worked a bit before I tried to get my cash, but I didn't expect to get the: "so you want to try and evade tax you little bitch" treatment. 
The fun part is that I got 750000 but I already payed tax the moment the company transfered it so 55 was left. But that is not enough they want your money every year untill they are sure you have to little to do the effort. This is how tax works. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:52:57
Same. But please can you help me with something. I am a bit stressed out because of some ghost stories on the internet. Let's say I buy €1000 on Bitcoin (or any other coin). I buy it via a website and put it in my electrum wallet. Now when the whole thing collapses and that €1000 is worth nothing. Is it possible that the site or the wallet can say "ok now you owe us some money" and I have to pay more than I've invested? I think this is not possible afcourse if you don't use sites with leverage. But it still makes me nervous. I was in the understanding that I bought crypto and than I own it. If it crashes, well it's gone but with no further problems than losing the exact amount of money that I put in not a penny more. (Besides the miner fees and the fee the website asks 2,5% when selling or buying). 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:26:02
This. Yesterday I was buying mikrosoft points and this site excepted bitcoins. I thought let's see how this works. I got linked and linked and I had to open my wallet and the site were I bought them and go back to the mikrsoft site and put in the coins and...well fuck this I'lll just use my bank: enter 4 digits and the rest is automatically. With a transaction fee so low that I don't even know what it is. And the moment I press ok i recieve the code on my email. So a total of 5 times pressing a button instead of 50 times.
And to be honest I order my groceries and pay €7 delivery costs just because I am too lazy to get my own groceries. So if the transaction fee at my bank was €5 for a €20 mikrsoft points code, and it was €0 with a cryptocoin I would still pay the €5 just because it is faster and most of all easier for me because I don't have to press all these fucking buttons.

Well the idea was to make a photo and challenge your friends to create the same photo. After everyone took the photo you have points and the one with the most points wins the game. This needed a database for the photos. 17000 is nothing for a app I learned. Most people who become rich of apps spend about 50000 on the actual app and about 100000 for marketing. Myi did not knew that at the time and so I had only left 3000 for marketing which bought me exactly one review after contacting about 2000 journalists all over the world.they simply didn't respond because I was small-time and this is all friends politic. So they basicly ignored me. I also learned there are companies that exist from people like me and search for apps like mine. They copy the app and change it a little bit. So they did and only in that app you had to put your pinky in the photo. Later a widely known TV show implement the same app as a gadget in the TV show. And my app was gone since the marketing of the other guys was about 100000 and so my app was the one that looked like I was the one copieng them. They made a ton of money and closed the app down I believe after a year and moved on to the next one. So yeah that's basicly it. Closed it down because I've had to pay about 125 a month to keep it running. And afcourse the apple Costs 100 a year. It wasn't on Android because that would have cost me another 25000. And believe me the company I worked with was about the 10th I researched. Alot of other companies wouldn't even start below 50000 investment from my side. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:41:01
Well I have a nack for losing money. Already lost 17000 once when i had the genius idea to create a app game and become rich. That was the hardest LOL off all for me. My friends still laugh about it. No Rugrats though, it was an adventure same as for Bitcoin. Funny thing is that the moment I invested in Bitcoin my friends were like "o shit we need to sell, he has so much bad luck if he buys, the whole thing is going to collapse". They really have a fun time now it is looking exactly like it lol.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:35:20
Well in the end of the conversation they basicly explained to me that if I took the money they've had no way to know how much was left after a year and I could try to evade tax. So wanting 50000 cash is making all the alarm bells go off on their side. I even called a lawyer about this and he explained that I would be allowed with some effort but they would be breathing down my neck to figure out what I've spend and maybe even make their own calculation and estimate the tax for the next year. The lawyer literrly said that if I would burn the money, they could make a calculation and come to the conclusion that I couldn't spend that amount of money that quick and still ask tax because according to their calculations I should have atleast 30000 left. And if I can't back up my spendings with proof they have the right to do so. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:47:16
Why is everybody in every thread saying: "buy low sell high." 
When now it's low people start panicing. I see threads about pissed of people because "Bitcoin is the king", but now everyone is running with their tail between their legs. 
Meanwhile I will be playing my violin and stay loyal to the cause. If it goes up again atleast I can be proud of my self for supporting the cause and not being a pussy. If it sinks, well it was a nice adventure. Stories over money.

Few I was sweating for a moment. I have a thousand Euro in it and I'd I loose that no problemo bit I'd I have to pay extra....problemo. 
I just use an exchange without all those options, hodling.
I was thinking this also could be because of the new Netflix Bitcoin doc. It's not new but fairly new in some countries. It's about people stealing bitcoins and going to jail for it and basicly in the end the main guy leaves New York saying it is dead in new York. Another person doesn't get a license for his Bitcoin project and you see him pull the Bitcoin stickers from the wall as if it is all over. In another bit it's about silk road and Bitcoin being criminal money. I could understand that people watching that doc thinking; " well not going near that thing, if America says it's over it must be dead". I mean if some fake news can create a dip why not a documentary.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:58:12
Well not exactly, stolen by developers most of the time. The biggest for a long time, rovio, also stolen the idea of angry birds after they got approached by the person with the actual idea. But basicly yes you are right. Developers get the most money with the lowest risk almost all the time. And also small software developers most of the time do not get rich. The developers who are already rich or have big investors get rich. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:26:03

Well I had €50000 once and I did not trust my bank. I wanted all the money in cash. So I called my bank and told them. After that I got a "gestapo cross-examination" why would I endanger myself and take that amount of money in my house. Was I am going to buy a car? Did I wanted to invest because they could help me with that. After about 15 minutes of awnsering questions and me becoming more stubboen: "uhm ma am its my money right I can do whatever I want with it. So give me my money"
And than she started to explain it doesn't work that way because I need to pay tax on it and after a year of I didn't spend it they needed to know that because I had to pay tax on it again. So basicly she told me I couldn't get the money because if they would give it they wouldn't have controll over my tax, and if I payed that. I had no choice but leave the money on my bank. 
And it's not like 50k is alot to them.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:43:42
I totally agree with you on that. But on the other hand before people started using plastic cards for example to pay with in store, it was only after it was made very easy. And indeed paying real small amounts with my bankpass is a problem still on this day and some stores still ask 10c transaction fee for small amounts. And we are paying in plastic for years now. So I believe in the crypto system but I think it will take years before we are going to use it. Only if the government's are going to enforce it like with plastic cards. It will be implemented faster I think. If this is the hat you mean afcourse.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:19:42
Yes indeed Bitcoin for me is the least good way for me to transfer money at the moment.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:30:33
I am not understanding this. If Bitcoin crashes althogether and you own Bitcoin but have no money anymore because it's worthless, are you saying you have to pay fees and lose more money? Sorry if I understand this the wrong way bit I thought if it hits zero it is done and you just lose the money without having to pay extra costs?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:37:46
Yes I thought so. Thanks for confirming this. Lots of crazy talk on the internet but the moment it cost me money I will check it out to be sure. I've contacted my site were I buy and they confirmed it can not go into negative. Thank you very much.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:56:45
Nope from the Netherlands. And only my friends know about it. The numbers add up because most of use try to spend the least amount of money and are at the same ballpark. Also the companies I am talking about do this Al over the world and search for apps everyday. So my story is probably the same by hundreds of fools like myself. The apps of this kind of price are mostly made in Russia, well mine was and alot of others I know about. So that's why the prices add up and the stories are similar. 
Edit: for the dutchies: the app is called xselfie in GTST and is exactly the same as mine. I even try to contact them saying I had the same app and all that but I didn't even get a respond. I reached out to a couple of lawyers and they say it's hopeless because if they just changed a small thing in the source code I have no chance. The app in the tV show is a fake app and doesn't exist in real life but the game of it is xavtly the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:04:58
Btw same goes for bitcoins. If I own more than 20000€ in bitcoins and I withdrawal I am obligated to inform the government and pay my tax on that amount. If I won't tell they will eventually find out that at some point I had 20k on my account and I believe they have 5/7 years to collect it. So even when it's all gone and I didn't pay they not only charge you with tax evasion but also claim the money you did not payed.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:12:17
I agree but in 2009 people sold because people said it would go any higher. Those people sold and some of them still thinking about killing themselves because they listened. If they didn't listened  and waited a bit longer they would be millionaire. 
I am in it for €1000 and that's what I can miss. Maybe ill even buy another €1000 because I can miss that. People who have a salary of €1000 and put in €1000 are just idiots. I feel no remorse for them.  I think you did good when you are ok with losing the money you spend. If you have sleepless nights over the money you might lose, you simply put in too much. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:53:57
That is absolutely true. Personally when my 1000 becomes 10000 I will be happy and probably cash out. And I will not have the feeling that I missed out if i find out that it was going to be 50000 if I not cashed out. Atleast I have 10000 and not nothing which also is a possibility. Also of my 1000 becomes 0 atleast I tried and lost with money I could lose. I really think you hit the nail. I knew a person who was a slotmachine addict. He put €400 in a machine and still though that he could win. I mean it pays out €200 max so I think those people really are sick and need help.

I was replying to the guy against hodl. I did not mean to judge anybody or anything (except for people spending more than they actualy can) the guy was hating on hodlers and what I was trying to say is that people who hold got the better end of the deal so far.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:21:46
A good explanation and I think you got some good points. Not sure what you mean with the hold example though. I was a goldsmith for 15 years and now my job is only buying gold from regular people (rings, bracelets etc.) The number one reason people will not sell to me is because 14kt gives them about 13€ for one gram. And they think they get 34€ for one gram because that is what the newspaper says. Wich is wrong. I think that was not your point but I wanted to say this. Gold is a bit overated. The only way gold is word 34€ is when it's 24kt and stamped by the government on a block of 6,12, or 25 kg. Only than it's worth that much. And regular people can't have such a block physically in their house.
