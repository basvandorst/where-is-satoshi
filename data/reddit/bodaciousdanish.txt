I thought I did...I set up a wallet especially on another platform, but the app set up its own wallet for me, which I didn't realise or didn't remember... 
Now I see how important all this is... It started off as a £20 punt... and now it's worth quite a bit more...
Would be so helpful to get it back...
I'm sure I'm not the first or last to be crying over bitcoins... lol

Thank you!! I’ll try that but I think it’s only my public key, which won’t help... 
This is certainly a learning experience for me! And will inoculate me against future stupidity and oversight... I hope!

Nope... starts with a 1... would appear that option is out then...

So the guy got done for dealing drugs on the darknet... 
Not real clever... I think he is the founder... Seemed so when I first looked into this, but now I see he's the BitBuddy founder, so might be linked but not the actual founder of the Wyre Bitcoin Wallet... 
(Not to be confused with SendWyre, which I did at first when looking for them...)
I don't know what a IUO is, couldn't find it on google either...??
Do you mean an IOU??
I have a 3D barcode thingie and a long string of letters and numbers... That's the private key right??

It does indeed help! I am a Mac guy so didn't even think of it... Better find an Android friend who will let me load it onto their phone... Although I did try to send the funds to another wallet before I updated the OS on my iphone... And it didn't work then, just kept spinning the wheel... I thought perhaps their exchange didn't work anymore or something... If it's still running on Android I may have a chance... Better get on it before Bitcoin crashes or something ;)
Thank you!!!
Actually  which country are you accessing that link from? My VPN logged through the UK shows it's not available 'yet'

Thanks for that info... I will give it a shot over the weekend when I have some time...
I hope the wallet is stored centrally as I have no idea how to extract that info from my phone... must be a way thou... google will help me!
Perhaps bitcoin will have hit 20k by the time I sort this out... lol

Hmmm... I believe it is the public address... not a great revelation... :(
