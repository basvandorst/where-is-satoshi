Just 1 person in the bank industry knew about bitcoin and told me that Thailand is not very prone about bitcoin.

I didn't cash out. I see bitcoin as investment for the futur. The price fluctuate so much that I m not really interested by it anymore. I even asked people around to stop watching every day but instead to look in general during the year and take it easy. I belive it will go up a lot  in 2 or 3 years when usa will be all alone with their problems. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:06:04
Bitcoin will go very high, believe me. I see the futur. Well not totally true, in fact I m in contact with dead people and I heared them telling me to keep bitcoin.

Bitcoin and ether are not security, it s crypto money. It s a money, this is why we call it  crypto money.

If it was a security, I still don t know what it means really, we would call it securycoin... Or secure coin.

Yes Kind of, I think. I m taxed based on residence (I m European) and  as I have no residence and live as a tourist only mainly in Thailand , i dont pay income tax and no country ask me to file tax or to report anything and I did this for the last 10 years and no problem so far, I have even renewed my passport 3 month ago ... No question asked in my country . Many rich do same... Some  want give up their US citizenship to be free of irs. Good luck to them because  it s going to be harder when you will have a Trump wall to keep Americans inside. Have a good day.

Sure No problem  it s all legal and you can do it too if you are not a US person. I am in Thailand and  I m a  tourist long term. This is years I have not paid any tax. I don't even file as I m a worldwide resident. Means no resident of any country= no tax. 
I m  part of a special species, called free men or PT perpetual  tourist or even digital nomad  . Took me 2 minutes to get this special status, I went to the town house and told them I m leaving my country for good.
But it s not working for US men as the USA  system is tax on citizenship. You are a slave of uncle Sam my friend. :)

What Is A Perpetual Tourist? (How Never To Pay Personal Taxes)
Russ Alan Prince ,  
 CONTRIBUTOR
I write about the creation and management of exceptional wealth.  
Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.
There are indeed many ways to legally avoid paying taxes. One approach is to become a perpetual tourist, also known as a perpetual traveler. The basic idea is that by not spending very much time in any jurisdiction, a person can legitimately avoid paying taxes and increase personal freedoms.
A key aspect of this approach is where the person is a citizen. The perpetual tourist has citizenship in a jurisdiction that does not tax monies earned outside the country. His or her legal residence is in a tax haven. It is preferable to have business interests where the corporate tax rates are low.
Making sure a person is and continues to be a perpetual tourist is a matter of following the rules and being able to prove he or she was doing so. Thus, depending on the situation, careful record keeping can be extremely important,” says Rick Flynn, managing partner of FFO Business Management &amp; Family Office and author of The High-Functioning Single-Family Office.
The situation becomes somewhat more complicated when the perpetual tourist is one of the super-rich (net worth = US$500 million or more) and seeks to manage his or her business enterprises, as well as ensure a very high-intensity lifestyle. For example, a billionaire perpetual tourist wanted a single-family office after having decided that the private banks he was relying on were gouging him and not matching his expectations. His major concern was being able to access just about all his resources and elite professional talent anytime and anywhere. Based on his requirements, the answer for him was a near-virtual single-family office.
Essentially, the structure consisted of six boutique accounting firms geographically dispersed. Each one is the cornerstone of his near-virtual single-family office when he is in that geographic region. Each accounting firm functions, in part, as coordinators of a litany of external experts, many of which never know whom the ultimate client is. Many communications are encrypted to further ensure privacy. Also, a number of customized apps were created to speed up the communications.
According to Angelo Robles, founder and CEO of the Family Office Association, “The family office model is becoming the norm for the very wealthy. It can be adopted to any set of circumstances where the very wealthy want extensive control to help them address their financial and lifestyle concerns.”

hello Dear future Investor,
nothing bad to btc will happen.all you hear are fear mongers...
segwit or lightning has been tested on litecoin just 2 months ago  and litecoin never went down.
i expect bitcoin to raise very fast during july and august due to Japan and Australia adoption , other countries will join the club as Venezuela, Russia,....
just buy bitcoin and dont regret if price goes down. wait a few months or even a few days, and you will win.
believe me.

@_date: 2017-06-05 03:11:16
i think July and August, will be a kick up in value of btc. i see it to get 3 to 5 times more or even more..
this is due to adoption of 250000 stores in japan as well the tax removal in Australia, and other countries will join the club.
so i expect bitcoin to be higher than 10000 dollars end of this year.
anything could happen in a night and your bitcoin will get 20x more.
