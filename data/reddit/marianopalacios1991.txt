I bought some Bitcoin before the fork on Coinbase. How do I check if I have some Bitcoin Cash? I may be wrong but is it true that you should have some BItcoin Cash available if you had Bitcoin before the fork? How do I check or where do I check. Sorry for being a noob!

You're all a bunch of conceited assholes aren't you? I never said I'm trying to get rich fast you freaking jerk. 
And why wait? Last time I waited it was at $2000 and they told me to wait. 
I downloaded and made my first transaction with Coinbase app. Anyone wanna say something about that? ��

Jesus Christ what a douchebag. Anyways I'm 25 and I've been saving 10% of my income on stocks and ETFs. Been hearing about Bitcoin and a few friends have been doing it for a while but never explain things correctly. I want to know if there's like an automated system for buying or something that makes it easy to make transactions. Don't be a loser crybaby douchebag like that guy.

Exactly. I'm wondering if there's a legal document available from Coinbase or whatever platform y'all are using.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:06:13
Never had that much money to have one ��

In the event that you inherit or otherwise become the owner of a deceased family member’s Coinbase account, rest assured that Coinbase has created a process to transfer the assets in the easiest manner possible. The best thing to do is contact us to make us aware of the situation. One of our analysts will work with you throughout the process. When you contact us, we will ask for the following documents:
Death Certificate
Last Will and Testament
Probate Documents (either Probate, Letters Testamentary, Letters of Administration, Affidavit for Collection or Small Estate Affidavit)
Current, valid government-issued photo identification of the person(s) named in the Letters Issued
A letter signed by the person(s) named in the Probate Documents instructing Coinbase on what to do with the balance of the Coinbase account. If you would like to have the digital currency sent to a non-Coinbase address, please provide a receiving address in your Letter of Instruction. If you would like to receive the digital currency in USD, you will need to create a Coinbase account so we are able to pay out to your bank account. Please let me know if you need any assistance in creating a Coinbase account.
If any documents are missing, please let us know, so we can assist you. If you are unfamiliar with Coinbase or digital currency in general, we would like to assure you that our support staff is standing by. We will answer any questions you may have and walk you through the process.
Please keep in mind that the required documentation and processes may differ depending on your region, residence, and individual situation. If we need additional information, we will request it via email.
Can I name a beneficiary on my Coinbase account?
Typically, naming a beneficiary on your Coinbase account would be done with your estate planning attorney. Like most other assets, the ownership of your Coinbase account would be transferred according to your will or other arrangements made with your legal counsel. It’s not currently possible to name a beneficiary directly within your Coinbase account, rather, in the event of your death, we would follow our standard ownership transfer procedures described above.

Nice! I buy from gdax... although it takes about a week to get the USD deposit and then buy BIT with that.... then I transfer that to my Coinbase because i like the layout of the app... 
Coinbase and gdax are the same log in.
