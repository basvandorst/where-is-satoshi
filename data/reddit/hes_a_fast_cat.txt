Personally I like to look into use-cases for the crypto. Practical purposes, current problems that it will solve or displace an existing solution, etc.
IMO if you don't see a long-term vision for the crypto, you are going to get shook by market movements.

That's not paying with Bitcoin though, that's paying with credit/USD with some conversions on the back-end. To me that's not really adoption of crypto, it's more of a workaround.

You guys realize the purpose of Big Bang Theory, a show that has been one of the most popular in the US for 10 years, is not to educate the masses about Bitcoin or even portray *any* form of technology in an educational fashion, right?
I'm not sure what everyone is expecting here. Bitcoin will be a very small piece of a plot line that could really be substituted with anything. Rare comic books, baseball cards, whatever.

You really think *75* tests come anywhere close to covering all aspects of LN?

How does Bitcoin become something you can use for everyday transactions in 2 years? Coffee, groceries, etc. 
Interested in how you think accepting Bitcoin is going to get rolled out nationwide in 2 years as well as how businesses are willing to accept 1 hour transaction times (which would be much, much longer if it becomes more widespread, no?)

Gemini works for me.

The main purpose for Coinbase to me is getting USD to crypto. I use Gemini for that purpose now as Coinbase's support is non existent, I have an issue that has been open for 12 days preventing me from making a deposit that has not been looked at yet.

Gemini is similar to Coinbase in that its main purpose is to get USD to crypto, then move it wherever you want.

If you want to spend something on goods and services, Bitcoin really isn't the best option in most cases currently. 1+ hour transaction times doesn't lend itself well to many transactions.

10% of an hour isn't really a tiny dip, who knows where it will settle though.

But... Coinbase isn't buying the BTC that is sold. They're simply making an exchange between two users, their own money isn't involved.

I also noticed this and laughed. I'm only using them to get USD into ETH/BTC and then move to other exchanges though.

TIL web servers are not scalable and your site crashing under heavy loads is nothing to feel bad about.

How does an exchange "accidentally" dip?

Doesn't really make sense to use the best year of one thing but then compare to 10 years of other assets. Comparing the best single-year run of each would make more sense. This chart makes it seem like Bitcoin just started in 2017.
