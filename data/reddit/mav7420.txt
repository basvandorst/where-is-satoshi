Thanks EasyCoin. All the pitchfork waving morons calling for blood need to read your comment.

brilliant idea

So what your saying is not everyone that supports bitcoin, supports bitcoin (anarchy)?
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:08:43
I guess that's why they never pressed those charges. But hey as long as they have morons like you to parrot the lies its mission accomplished. Let me guess you work for them right?

Wow what an explosive episode. You couldn't make this shit up, and there is still more to come. Unbelievable.

Damn I really care how 'most people' view me, this has made me rethink everything. The next time somebody asks "what are the most mindblowing recent advancements most people still don't know about?" I will be sure never to mention a word about Bitcoin. I would hate to be judged negatively and not gain approval of 'most people'.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:19:02
Thank you for getting Litecoin mentioned in the top of I never thought I would see that :D

Nice to see your promoting ignorant douches who labels bitcoin a ponzi scheme and a scam. I bring this up on every bitcoin video he releases and he continues to stand by the ponzi scheme claim and says its a scam or deletes my comments.

This shill still labels bitcoin a 'ponzi scheme' while at the same time promoting it to his audience as a great way to make money and encourages them to donate with bitcoins.

Chris Duane saying 'it stinks' repeatedly does nothing for the discussion, offer some evidence. Suggesting the cia may have secretly created a open source p2p decentralized network that they have no control over, as a means of control makes no sense. His comments on mining show someone frustrated that they are to stupid to be able to mine and so chucked a tanty at the whole concept. 
Chris Duane has decided to bury his head deep in the sand and really shows a complete lack of understanding in this interview.
@_date: 2013-08-27 02:00:09
These comments from soundcloud sum it up:
"This is genius, perfectly captures the whole scene in a dope rhyme"
"This is exactly why YTCracker is one of the top nerdcore artists out there"

I like the idea and would like to contribute, but perhaps using  to get it funded might be a better idea. I'm not that comfortable sending bitcoins to a random website.

He labels bitcoin a ponzi scheme and then requests bitcoin donations and people donate... wtf
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:32:31
My thoughts exactly Jack. Excellent critique of Chris Duanes attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:53:33
Yeah commenting on a reddit post asking "Tech savvy folks of Reddit, what are the most mindblowing recent advancements most people still don't know about?" is exactly the same as "the religious ringing your doorbell on sunday."

Bitcoin went to 1 cent on Mt.Gox because an they had poor security and got hacked, it was not a reflection of the real price which returned as soon as the hack was fixed. This was over 2 years ago, if your going to base your decision to use bitcoins on this that's up to you. You can however use bitcoin without even using Mt.Gox and there is now many other exchanges as well as sites like localbitcoins.com where you can avoid the exchanges altogether.
I would research bitcoin thoroughly, the information is all out there, just google any questions you have. The bitcoin wiki is also good place to start:
Chris Duane is not a good guy, if you research bitcoin you will see his videos are full of lies and disinformation. Don't believe me, do the research yourself.

He promotes gold silver bitcoin and what else? If this is your definition of a serial hyper-upper most of the users of this subreddit would fall into that category. 
Call me a serial hyper-upper, but gold silver and bitcoin are all great investments in my opinion.

Its great to see Alex Jones finally covering Bitcoin. His channel has 450,000 subscribers and his radio show is listened to by millions so this should bring a massive influx of new users to Bitcoin.

Turthnevertold(Chris Duane) has put out a bitcoin series full of lies and disinformation. The 28000 subscriber sheeple who follow him can be seen quoting these videos throughout youtube. 
Upvote this reddit post so the bitcoin reddit community can take action. Dislike these videos on youtube and comment appropriately!

Great interview, always enjoy Trace Mayer's analysis of the current state of bitcoin. 
Unfortunately it seems the disinformation being spread on youtube, such as Chris Duane's hit pieces, are having an effect judging from the comments and dislikes on this video. =/
