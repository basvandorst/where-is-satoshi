Let me know if I get this straight.
In r/bitcoin a [self confessed troll]( submits a post trolling and it gets more tan 80 upvotes and gets to the frontpage?

I thought I was paranoid. Good to know trolls exist.
It is not paranoia if trolls really are here.
Did you just admit that you troll people in this sub?

This is just a fact: You are not Mike Hearn.
Edit: He deleted his username. For sake of understanding, his username was "mike_heam", very similar to the real "mike_hearn".

When it has at least 75% support, but not before 2016 even if it has more than 75% support.

8GB will be in 2036. Many users around the world can process 8GB rigth now. In 2036 even your watch will be able to process 8GB.

you mean censorship?

Bitcoin Core will not notify anything, because core developers don't want to. However, anyone can see the Bitcoin blockchain. It is public and visible. Anyway, you will know long before 75% support is reached.

Do you realize 8gb will be in 2036?
BTW, 8gb blocks are possible right now by many users. In 2036 your watch will download much faster than that.

After listening to his ideas and arguments for many years (this video is another example), it is clear to me that he is harming Bitcoin by:
1-. Proposing solutions to problems that do not exist or people have figured how to deal in better ways.
2-. Opposing solutions to problems that do exist.
I understand his arguments perfectly because they are simplified and simple. His arguments are wrong. I don't write long posts because I am lazy and I am not going to explain all the logical fallacies or misconceptions or mistakes that Peter Todd makes. Just wanted to share that it is clear to me, Peter Todd is making us all waste time and thus harming Bitcoin.
In the end, cryptocurrencies are unstoppable. But sometimes some people delayed the unstoppable harming everyone for years.

Bitcoin XT waits until at least 75% of mined blocks vote for XT.

No, nothing happens with 50% support. Fork is only triggered when/if gets more than 75% support. Once it happens, the weak branch will quickly merge into the strong branch. Only one branch will exist in the end. It makes no sense to stay in a weak branch that is loosing support.

If you don't know what a Bitcoin node is, then you have to do nothing. Your Bitcoins are always safe. On the other hand, if you know what a Bitcoin node is, then run Bitcoin XT node. You can get it here:

According to the downvotes, it seems that you are the one not welcome here.

Increasing the block size will reduce the fees required per transaction.
But there will be more transactions in each block and the total fees in each block could be higher.

Jabugo Ham is Serrano Ham. Every Jabugo is Serrano. But not every Serrano is Jabugo. Jabugo is a special kind of Serrano made in a [small town in Spain](
