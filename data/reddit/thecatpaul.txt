Lets put it like this. There is not 50% chance that bitcoins will take over the entire world market. There is not even 1% chance, or 0.1 or 0.001 or 0.000000000001. You have to convince EVERYONE to ONLY use bitcoins then, things which can't be withdrawn from ATM's and will therefore be very hard to use in emerging economies. Even China have big problems accepting a normal freaking visa.

It is used to transfer value, pretty transparent. This has nothing to do with a pyramide scheme, there is no people getting money from recruitment etc. People throw that phrase around but you have no fucking idea wtf it means.
There is a difference between overvalued and pramide/ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:28:59
This makes no sense at all? It has no inherent value, but it still has a use.
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:38:26
You realize that there is a pretty wide grey zone right? 
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:16:41
Yup, this is why this price change is terrible. There is so much demand for bitcoins, but it is for speculative purposes mostly, there is not enough use for them yet. If they did a constant rise in proportion to where you could spend them we would be less likely to see a crash. Even a constant rate of 1% a week is insane, and that would kill off some of the speculators and make people more willing to actually spend them.

It was stable for the better part of half a year, buy there and you know that at least you wont lose EVERYTHING the next day.

Never invested always said it was in a bubble after recent growth, but that doesn't change what it is.
You have no idea what you are talking about, but whenever you don't understand something that crashes you scream PONZI PYRAMIDE because you read about those in the papers. Know what the fuck the difference is before you make an ass out of yourself.

He is not talking about arbitrage options, he is merely talking about pushing price down which actually kinda works in this situation. 
The following is putting it on the edge, but just to illustrate, in this case using MTGOX as the exchange of choice.
Let's assume that you will sell where there is the highest price and buy where the price is lowest, let's also assume that most people use and know about MTGOX compared to OTC, this effectively means that you will move faster from OTC to MTGOX because it is easier to sell your bitcoins there. Person A buys OTC puts it on MTGOX, effectively pushing down the price on MTGOX and increasing the price on OTC. Now the sellers will be more likely to sell OTC and buyers will be more likely to buy on MTGOX. However as we assume MTGOX was more widely used than OTC, the sellers will move back faster to MTGOX than the buyers will move to OTC. This effectively pushes the price down.
I know there are a couple of assumptions in this, but I would think that they are at least fairly reasonable.

thus wait
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:05:02
Sorry, didn't notice it said system D, only read system.
That being said, 50/50 is still pretty ludicrous odds.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:42:12
Whelp, yet another use.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:29:35
Well why are bitcoins skyrocketing?
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:28:28
Nope and this is basically why I believe we will see a crash, and a fairly hard one.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:49:17
Positive feedback loops can end in overvaluing as well.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:31:49
You can lower the risk by waiting till it is stable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:43:41
So what you are saying is that it will continue to fluctuate as much as it does now? Not only is that historically wrong it is also never seen before, and it is not that small it has a larger market cap than most microcap firms.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:51:21
This has nothing to do with bitcoins, you traded them for USD and bought food. You could just as well have accepted USD
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:33:19
No that is not the definition of a pyramid scheme, go even read the fucking wiki article. 
Also some people are using it to buy shit with, so it is merely overvalued, but it still represents some value.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:18
The same exact scenario can be applied to a rise in 1USD just with smaller percentages and numbers, that is the problem. How much profit you want to make depends on your appetite for risk.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:40:21
Yeah that was a fair assessment.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:05
If they do all of their decrease in this short amount of time I'd be baffled, pretty sure it will continue to fall for 1-2 days then hit a stable point go up and then steadily rise.
You can however make serious amounts of money with quick transactions here as the market is insanely volatile. it jumps up and down with 5-10% all the time
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:01:26
I aint really blaming people, I'm just saying this current scenario is EXACTLY how you manufacture a crash. Look at the housing market in spain, speculators bought from speculators because they thought prices were ever rising. The supply far exceeded the actual demand, the ACTUAL demand for bitcoin now is, I would think, low. Thus when people thinks the price is topping, they will start to sell, people will be reluctant to buying them as their previous reason for doing so, speculating on price increase, seem less likely. You currently don't need bitcoins for anything, especially if the crisis in EU gets solved without breaking the bank sector in half. After this our old buddies supply and demand pokes sharp sticks at the bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:05:21
This does not have the power to bring the state crumbling down, as if and/or when it does it will be declared illegal. This is not some conspiracy crazy thing, but bitcoins might really be an asset for this world, but it will not be an all dominating factor.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:00:23
It is almost impossible to say when the top has been reached due to great fool theory. Amount of fucking hindsight in here is retarded, everyone knew it was a bubble but no one knows when it pops.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:56:50
I actually think this is bad. As once the curve eventually stabilizes all the speculators who have bought in might start to see that moment of the curve as a topping point, and then start selling out.
Edit: Terrible grammar
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:27:34
People may be irrational, but it is not like a week of stalemate is going to kill it off. But give bitcoins two months of no increase and people might thing the top has been hit and start selling like crazies.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:48:51
After the banking crisis on Cyprus is resolved I believe they will dip a bit, which is when I'll buy

True, but the value would drop like a brick at first or am I missing something?

Well they can, no fees leads to market manipulations by bots.

You can't just say profit, if it rises 1 usd you will be making a profit, are you cashing out then?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:47:17
I read it ages ago, just read it again. Bitcoin is not a pyramide scheme, it might be GROSSLY overvalued, doesn't change the fact that it aint a pyramide scheme. There are plenty of bad things to say about it, why make shit up?
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:59:23
Bitcoins have no inherent value and neither does fiat. You can't use bitcoins to feed the starving, treat the sick or house the poor. It's value is purely based on faith and faith alone. It does share that with fiat money. Actually fiat money can at least be burnt, without faith and support bitcoins are UTTER worthless.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:57:36
Well thought out post.
I also doubt it will crash back to 10, however 30-40 would be a pretty likely scenario in my opinion. 
I have one qualm though, people who speculate will not try to get their money back via services. They will get currency, or gold, because this can be reinvested. Also you can buy a helluva lot of pizza's with the amount of Bitcoins some people are sitting on(I know that is not the only service or commodity you can).
Another thing is, while many hands are good, it seems like the new people here are generally new to the whole concept of investing and may be easy to startle, especially if they think this is a type of "Get rich fast" thing. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:55:24
Well if this whole debacle is caused by market manipulation which I highly doubt, then if you shorted bitcoin via futures you would be a very rich person today.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:41:11
That is the problem. Everyone is talking about how they bought in and are getting rich, which essentially is great and all that, but it means that it is done for speculative purposes. They don't use their bitcoins to buy shit with. The value currently, imo, is too high for its use. It should rise as I like the system, but it should rise in proportion to its usefulness, not as a hoarding tool. Because using them as a hording tool means this shit will crash, hard.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:27:29
Actually this mindset is why we will almost certainly see a bubble. People refuse to spend their bitcoins because they go all "I'LL BE A RICH MOTHERFUCKER" but once the curve flattens out, which it will do eventually, if the places you can spend it is trailing even a little behind, people will start selling out massively as they think a top point have been reached. Chain reaction and all that.
People actually spending their bitcoins instead of hoarding them for speculative use is the only way out of this situation with a major crash.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:05:07
The person who wrote this have no fucking idea what inflation means.

on the rise? You can say they are anything at the moment, unless you want to do quick trades stay the fuck away from them till they stabilize.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:56:46
Greater fools theory is based on overvalue which in turn is present neither a pyramide nor ponzi scheme, at least as a main theme. 
What it represent is an anonymous way of transfering wealth as well as store. If you believe in that fine, if you don't then it is overvalued.
@_date: 2013-07-05 09:50:39
No it is not a "fair" manipulation, as people with huge funds can absolutely fuck up EVERYTHING. So no, it absolutely is not "fair" to make a pump and dump. There is a pretty decent reason it is illegal.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:10:08
Yup, same opinion. Problem is mainly imo that the merchants can't possible adapt as fast as the currency is rising, which is a clear indication of speculation or hoarding to avoid getting Cyprus'ed.
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:23:06
You apparently don't know what inherent value means. The only reason you can buy USD with it is because people have faith and support bitcoins, without that then they are worthless numbers on a screen.
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:40:41
Fuck it, I've explained it over and over again, you are either being intentionally stupid or you really don't want to get it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:17
Point is it is still subjective, it is up to each individual. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:53:35
It is not a pyramid scheme. It is what it is, if you find that overvalued fine, but it is neither a ponzi nor a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2013-03-29 14:10:02
Okay I'll bite assuming you are a troll.
The only value it has is what you attributing to it, ie. you can trade it for something else.
Food has inherent value, you can eat it and stay alive.
Shelter has inherent value, you can sleep somewhere and jerk off in the bathroom.
Medicine has inherent value, you can use it to stop puking everywhere.
Bitcoins does _nothing_ by itself and has therefore no inherent value. If I got ALL the worlds bitcoins and no one believed in them, I'd be at the exact same point I am now.
Bitcoins has value because people believe in it as a currency and a way of buying/selling goods. Fiat money is exactly the same, except it has some amount of actual value as you can use it for shit.
I'll say it again bitcoins are UTTER worthless without faith and support.
The bottom line is, if shit hits the fan and everyone lose faith in the system you will be sitting with a ton of worthless shit on your computer, where as if you had been trading in a commodity you could use that for something as there is an actual need for it.
