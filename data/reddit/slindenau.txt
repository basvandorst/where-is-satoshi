They don't use pounds in Canada.

How dumb are you? Even if the FIAT value goes to 0, the fact still remains that 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
That mathematical proof does not make any statement about the purchasing power of said 1 BTC. Jeez.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:34:13
You seem to not understand how reality works. Bitcoins whitepaper is imagination my friend (the economical part, not the technical part; that works), it will never work in the real world ;).
Business will always converge to intermediate service providers for anything that is not their core-business, that is how our economy works. Oh wait, let me guess, you also want to change that right?
We call that naive.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:38:28
If it's off chain, you're not paying in BTC :).

An index fund is by definition not an informed investment; you leave the hard work to the owners/creators of the fund...
@_date: 2018-03-25 08:22:56
There wasn't any usage to begin with my friend, only transactions on exchanges between people trying to make 10x.
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:26:21
Just use fractional reserving between layer 1 and 2 and you're set. Works perfectly fine for fiat :).
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:16:19
Can we not? It's mandatory to be one. You missed an essential lesson about commenting on the internet my friend. I suggest you watch "Internet Comment Etiquette with Erik".
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:11:54
Exactly, and that is a much better thing than going up exponentially :).

Please enlighten us how we can apt-get install Microsoft Word?
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:58:11
Why would you want to shut down the official bitcoin site?
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:27:41
The why part is very easy; because most people don't have rackmount setups at home or rented/colocated. A lot more people have Pi's.
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:05:55
Geesh, it's like crypto's are becoming a real currency. With all the scams, corruption, politics, centralization and regulation. Exactly all the things it was said to fight against; ironic isn't it :)?
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:56:48
Ah yes, some piece of technology that *in some edge cases is marginally better than the USD*, but worse in every other aspect, is going to solve world debt. You might be slightly naive.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:59:33
It won't because centrally controlled blockchains are called databases. And they're not crypto according to many believers.
If you really believe that decentralized stores of value will replace fiat, you are very naive.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:22:51
Exactly, this is just java.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:43:27
Indeed, it has no utility with a high price. Nor will it have one with a low price. Good observation.
@_date: 2018-03-28 07:35:13
It would be smarter to invest in something that will remain to exist in 16 years...because BTC surely won't.
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:45:26


No, any possible fees are already embedded in the sales price beforehand. That means even people who are paying with cash are paying the fees, but in that case it's pure profit for the business.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:48:18


He has a point here; most people who do "research" visit the site of the coin, scroll through the whitepaper and call themselves "experts" and "invest" in the coin.
Makes me laugh.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:03:18


At the cost of those poor people putting in their life savings at the peak, only to see the value drop in half. Congratulations man.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:35:29
Exactly. Pi has random digits. Messages stored in the blockchain are not random; they are put there by humans (mostly).
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:55:55
No it won't. If you want a currency to retain a steady value, you need centralized regulation of that currency by a capable party.
Central banks use all their tools crypto fans hate so much to make sure the fiat retains it's value (as much as possible; a bit of inflation in the long term is not a problem).
If you leave the value to the free market, anything can *and will* happen at any time.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:18:42
But Bitcoin Cash *is* bitcoin, just as much as Bitcoin Core *is* bitcoin. So your "fact" is wrong ;).
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:45:12
No, people are not interested in what they can or can't do with any cryptocurrency. As long as they can yell "Hold", "Moon" and "Lambo" they're happy to sink money in useless coins :).
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:15:21
Just make sure to follow the law next time :).
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:18:13
Sure it can be better, it could be 0 sat/b.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:10:54
So just because you've been a customer for x years means you should be allowed to participate in "illegal activities" (in their policy)? Your logic amazes me.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:43:13
Wrong. You can fork the github and create a new coin with 100% premine out of thin air. Or create a token on a blockchain like ETH with 100% premine. Both are zero effort.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:14:16
10k? You mean 20k right? Ah yes 1k, lot of money.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:47:48
It's a token, therefore 100% crypto. You can't just go around mislabeling something just because you don't like it...
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:59:46


Wrong, it has value because people want it. There is no other reason anything has value. There are lots of utilities that have (close to) no value, and lots of valuable things that have no utility.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:14:33
Smart people don't own crypto ;).
They use crypto when it's the only payment option for a purchase, but beyond that they're not stupid enough to "hold" or "daytrade".
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:36:23


Then they did not get the donation in BTC...
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:12:29
So in order to prevent scam posts, you start spamming harder in an attempt to out-spam scammers?
It would be more noble to write a bot that detects scam posts, and automatically have them reported to Twitter.

It's a token, therefore 100% crypto. You can't just go around mislabeling something just because you don't like it...
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:22:02
No, he said it failed *thus far*. It could be better in the future.
I guess most people don't read any further than the title.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:33:08
 sounds like the official BTC site to me.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:18:30
So someone who is spreading the truth is a "compromised account" now. Wow.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:28:45
Holders are the people that will watch the price fall to 0 and think "this is fine". Keep it up with the memes, even though you're playing with your life savings.
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:12:57
And slowly crypto becomes what it was supposed to defeat. A system corrupted by greed.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:06:40
No, it won't. The man has a lot of experience in BTC, if he doesn't run a node now he can't/doesn't want to.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:06:57
No, thats this sub. You're getting things mixed up.
@_date: 2018-04-14 08:15:00
Yet it's the only way crypto will ever be usable in the real world. U mad?
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:25:48
But that technically isn't "downtime". The system was working "as intended".
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:31:55
But that has nothing to do with the lightning network, just the inefficient visualization techniques used.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:16:21
Thanks for helping people get rid of \(parts of\) their bags. They appreciate it greatly.
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:57:16
Don't tell 'em that, they will get so mad when they realize banks will just incorporate all the good things about crypto and then let crypto die a slow death :\).
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:20:30
Yes, when there is a problem on a decentralized exchange you literally have nobody to turn to. Better to lose all your money guaranteed instead of having to wait x months on a support ticket right?
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:29:33
Are you sure you want to add another negative point for Bitcoin??
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:04:25


No it's not. Check you local laws and find out if Bitcoin is mentioned as a basic human right.


Yes, the government does. If a law is passed that says exactly that, they have the right.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:37:00


Is another term for ponzi/pyramid scheme, you are aware of that?
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:20:05
But the best part is, LN isn't even BTC lol. If it's not on the chain, it's not BTC ;\). You're transferring an IOU around BTC. Funny how the community thinks that the best solution for BTC's performance problems is...not using BTC at all.
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:06:28
No wonder that a sub called "Bitcoin" is mainly pro Bitcoin. If you want to discuss crypto news in general without bias, go to as per the Community guidelines.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:07:55
The bubble *will* burst once people find out that it's not just easy 1000% gains anymore, and that besides that it's completely useless as both a store of value or a currency.
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:31:38
You're acting like deflation is a good thing??
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:08:02
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:18:09
Anything that handles in currency for a living has to adhere to the law...if you guys want crypto to be a currency, don't come here to cry that you have to follow the respective laws. You will have to accept the good AND the bad of the "currency" status.
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:21:20
Trustless? It's the biggest trusted system out there lol. You have to trust:
\- the software devs writing making the right choices
\- the miners making the right choices of accepting changes implemented by the software devs
\- software people are not educated in economy. So why would you trust them in making the right economical choices?
\- miners don't share the same interest as the software devs, they only want to make as much money as fast as possible.
The only thing you don't have to trust is the person you're sending/receiving money to/from.
