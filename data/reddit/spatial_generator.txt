Severe price correction. Hold. Watch. And take it as a man :)
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:24:53
So what?
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:20:56
I believe what is defeated is the idea of centralization of miners as they are running an oligarchy (if not monopoly) ... turning the bitcoin production into mass manufacturing and trying to support that with the Tuxedo of scaling is a lethal scheme. Of course this is just a little battle and not the whole war. Tactically advancing. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:27:17
If you are going to buy and hold your coins just because there will be a price rally expected ... You are not not supporting Bitcoin ecosystem.

Exactly. Altering the original Core limitations/ restrictions / rules will harm the trustworthiness and the devastate the psychological (whimsical) charm of bitcoin. &lt;opinion&gt; .

I heart Bitcoin :)

Adding to what you said ...They are covering and/or promoting events that are covering government controlled fintech startups (and other monstrous centralization scenarios). 
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:06:45
Wake up!
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:20:45
Before the price rally some fireworks will be fun :) ... The journalists as you said they are not experts and most of the time they are not doing in-depth analysis ... Few guesses here and there that's all.

ASICBOOSTERS! 
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:35:02
No damage happened.. Nothing serious. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:48:17
You will see and feel the heat also.

Hoarding gold is evil. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:29:03
Remember: bitcoin is scarce. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:08:03
If the war is deploying Stuxnet-like scheme and electronic-warfare .. I think bitcoin will be hurt. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:50:14
take a lil nap!
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:09:28
It broke the resistance arc and there was a buying signal ... Enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:53:19
Awesome !!!

Why not?!
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:14:39
hehehe! 
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:49:53
Ofcourse it wont last long before it increases further more. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:08:57
The banks! Are we expecting any good from them? Honestly? They are fighting for the system that feeds them.
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:19:04
They are trying already ... When they focus on blockchain technologies but they avoid talking about "Bitcoin".. Or when they are creating their own national crypto-coins. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:48:27
Stuxnet is warfare. Anything is possible. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:21:03
I think they will just say that they did the right thing... They will return to continue their sell-off show...
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:29:42
When the price goes UP that much without true signals it will also drop down in the same way ... How many times had we been into such a situation? It did not even build enough support to stay that high yet. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:25:21
Its in two ways ... The others who are hyper-optimistic are also riding it towards a bubble and this is also fatal for the whole Bitcoin philosophy... Introducing banking system tools into cryptos will probably kill it... Leverage , forwards and options. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:19:16
It must go down before it goes up to a new high each time. Most of the selloff will happen to collect profits... No market paranoia though. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:26:56
They are just riding the price towards a fuzzy direction ... How on earth the price is jumping $400 in less than a week for an unknown reason will be explained? Explain how it goes it... You will know why it will dip again. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:36:24
I do not do cost average .. Every time it goes it... It comes down especially it did not yet build enough support in the 1300 zone.. How come it just skips that easily ? The prices are swollen. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:19:08
Its crypto anymore. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:28:06
I was at 1366... Dude it was hours before the Tsunami while everything was just calm! 
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:30:28
Good or bad... There will be (as expectations) a severe price correction mania. That's bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:36:29
Perhaps this will influence the price but its not lethal for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:42:01
It will dive and dip further I *guess* .
