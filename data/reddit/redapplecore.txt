Anyone who's jealous of him is batshit crazy, like him (or, I suppose they just don't know enough about him)

I don't understand why people who want to buy the dip don't want it to go lower.  If people believe it will some day inevitably moon then why try and stop it from being more of a discount.
To me it all seems like people trying to get others to give them courage without admitting they're scared

they mean like 100's = 100 - 999, 1000's = 1000-9999

Currently standard investments are outpacing inflation, I have no idea if that'd be the case for the full 100 years (1919 was just 10 years before the great depression) but it's been pretty true since at least 1990

Yeah I definitely feel like I need the 2 year caveat.  I don't personally believe it will happen in 10 either but, that's way too long a time period for me to feel any confidence, and I definitely couldn't say impossible.  
Personally I think McAfee is fantastic at selling his brand.  He found an excellent place to advertise himself by making a claim/wager that he knew would be repeated ad nauseam and he jumped at it.  He sold tweets of him shilling coins.  I personally can't wait to see what excuse he has for as to why he wont eat his dick, or if he just pretends the whole thing never happened in the first place.  He was able to escape a murder charge, I'm sure he feels invincible

The market cap of Bitcoin alone would be 20 trillion at that point, so I'd contest that it is effectively impossible

Certainly doesn't look like it -

All of the other positive predictions have been wrong for the last year, but this is the one that will finally be right, I can feel it.

Within 2 years?  Yes.  That's a good deal more than the amount of money of all currencies in circulation worldwide.  That would require bitcoin grow at 0.718% a day between now and then, which is significantly faster than McAfee's original prediction, which was already very insane. 
That being said, after posting the comment I decided there is probably a very very very slight chance that USD would suffer from massive inflation within 2 years without bringing down the entire world's economy, and 1 million USD would mean peanuts at that point, so I'd like to amend my statement and say that I think 20 trillion USD at today's current value for USD is impossible in that time frame.

Your work is really good, I regularly pay for stuff like this, do you submit anything to stock sites?  (like  ?)  if not, you should look into it
Edit: Nevermind, I see on your site that you do, awesome!

He's already wimped out, as is the charlatan's way

210 trillion market cap, that doesn't sound insane at all /s
