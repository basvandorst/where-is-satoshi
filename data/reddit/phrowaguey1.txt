Are you holding your bitcoin offshore?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:02:59
Roll it over to a Scottrade (or another brokerage's) IRA account and you won't have to pay fees.
If you don't "roll it over" (meaning moving it from a retirement account to ANOTHER retirement account) then you are cashing out the 401K and will get hit with penalties.
What you can do is open an IRA account, roll over the 401k into it, and then invest in GBTC (so far the only ETF that deals with bitcoin). ** Please educate yourself in all these types of account, transfers and investment vehicles before you do anything. ***
Hope this helps.

If you are sure you want to put your retirement into bitcoin, this is the easiest/fastest way.  Roll over your 401k to an IRA in something like Scottrade, and buy GBTC.

Do you use Timemachine? Maybe you have backups of the iPhone on a Timemachine volume somewhere?

Where did you read that? Link?

It does, but like he said, he's not cashing out right now. He wants to have a system in place for when he decides to pull the trigger.
I think Coinbase would be the easiest. Set it all up with 2FA (make backups of the 2FA recovery key as well just in case) and it should be pretty secure.

You're currently getting a 45% return already? Sounds legit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:43:20
Valid concern, but...do you take the same precautions with your other investment accounts or with utilities company's bill pay systems?  I'm sure that if hackers get into Coinbase, their main objective are bitcoins. I wouldn't worry about it too much. 
As many shortcomings as Coinbase has, security doesn't seem to be one (never been hacked, as far as I know). Set up 2FA (and make a backup of those recovery keys) for extra security.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:22:18
What is your concern?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:44:40
I think FDIC only works in case of bank failure, not hacking. There's probably private insurance for that.

Are you in the US? If so, all the legit exchanges are required to collect this info. Just like a bank/brokerage when you open an account.

Not a CPA, but I don't think FATCA applies. It applies if you have financial assets in foreign countries, or if you hold foreign assets. For crypto, I believe the IRS treats it as property (for now).  Here's their guidance:
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:20:00
Your wallet will have a public address, which is used to receive transactions. Copy that address, enter it in Coinbase as the address you are sending to, double check it, and send.
Make sure you understand that Coinbase will take a cut, so you won't receive the entire amount. This is their fee.
If you want free transactions, use Gdax. Gdax is Coinbase's trading platform.

Does Coinbase charge the $10? Because most banks charge ~$20-25 for outgoing wire transfers. That would make it a total of $30 and it would only make sense for huge transfers.

"If your Trezor is stolen". That's the key part of the article.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:09:08
Just give it time. 
Another route: there is an ETF out there (GBTC) that you could potentially invest in if you had an IRA/Roth IRA at a brokerage or a solo-401k.

You can purchase via bank funds and while your bitcoin will still take about a week to show up in your account, you effectively buy at the current market price of when the buy transaction is executed. 
Not great, but at least you don't have to wait a week for your funds to clear from bank to Coinbase, and then buy. That's what I did last week, and while I'm still waiting for see my bitcoin, I bought it at last week's price.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:33:29
I mean that both converting it to USD (example: cashing out), and also making purchases (purchasing with bitcoin) are both taxable events. So the answer is yes, you have to pay taxes on purchases even when you pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:09
You could open a 2nd checking account for your bitcoin transactions. I read that banks like BoA and Capital One (so far) have not blocked/had issues when customers purchase bitcoin.

a) pay them
b) lol

This might be the wrong forum for this question. You should ask him.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:01:09
Probably not. But there are some article out there about creating a Self-Directed IRA that one could potentially use to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:53:09
Typical ACH transfers between banks usually take 2-3 days. Not sure why it takes twice as long with Coinbase. They're probably holding the money and making a little in interest.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:41:15
I thought the same thing last week, when I made my first buy. Still waiting...

I guess the link that OP posted was deleted, but yes. According to the article, there is a hack that could give access to your seed, but physical access to the the device is needed.

The 10 day waiting period is on the Coinbase side while your money gets transferred from your bank to theirs. When you send your coin to a wallet, in theory, it should be quick but that is affected by the load on the bitcoin network side (that's what I gather after reading a bunch of stuff, I'm also a n00b).
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:24:55
You only pay taxes when you realize your gains, which means when you sell BTC into dollars/fiat currency.
