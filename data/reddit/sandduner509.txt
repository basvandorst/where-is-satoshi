Eli5 what this means?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:07:19
So do these other wallets provide lower and/or faster transaction speeds ovee coinbase or something? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:02
Id like to buy in at $150. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:02
What about the coinbase vault? Is that more secure then just leaving it on the coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:20
It wasn't announced, I think it surprised a lot of people considering the gains bch is seeing right now.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:36:45
And how much is it up from December of 2016? GTFO with your cherry picking BS
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:00:12
The market is still up 79% from a year ago. Even at 5.6k, were up nearly 50%. Market is still strong
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:17:42
I think you nailed it on the head. I see it as a gamble, I have my speculations but in no way think anything involving crypto is guaranteed.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:56:00
You can dump yours into my wallet
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:17:24
Nearly 2 years into. Recently started having overheating issues thst were 100% self inflicted. I have my miners in my garage which often gets dirty from outside air, dogs, cats, etc. They got quite clogged with debris. Have since cleaned them out and added a intake filter. 1 of the 2 miners occassionaly gives me issues. But honestly, miners should last for years if left to run continuously in a cool and clean environment.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:57:37
What are the major pools everyone is working with? I've been on slushpool for a year and some change and haven't seen the number of active miners quite hit the level they were at late 2017
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:58:33
Research? What research did you do, earlier in the year, that told you the price would nearly triple before July or hell even the end of the year? 
Don't bull shit a bull shitter.

A couple i joined coinbase through a friends invite link. After spending my first 100 bucks coinbase gave me 10 bucks free in btc. Doubled that free money since then and wish i woild have kept all my money i invested in btc instead of alts.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:09:15
Hell in 10 years we may cry tears of joy or misery depending on which way the alt coins go. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:25:38
Which websites?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:00:03
Bought into bitcoin 2 months ago and immediately traded it for ARK coin. Kicking myself ask ARK has done nothing while BTC has nearly doubled in those 2 months. Put more money into BTC tonight at $6410.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:02
Eli5 what this means? Im a small fish but i still like my small gains.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:28:48
Yep, definitely a noob here. Won't lie about that. Not trying to buy and sell on a regular basis, going for long term gains here...
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:02:56
I've been watching bitcoin for 2 years. I was afraid of what it was going to do then. I am still afraid of what it is going to do now, but I don't have so much money invested that it will kill me if everything goes under. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:59:27
I liked what i read about it, it had a pretty steady rise over a short time for an alt coin and it was rather inexpensive. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:52:59
Is the coinbase vault safe enough for small amounts? Say under $5,000 in value?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:24:43
I think I will hold onto my ARK coins, if they go broke oh well I am not that heavily invested into them. Maybe someday they will be worth something. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:04:57
I got in at 3500, traded it all for ARK. Bought more BTC at 7250, now shitting myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:37:18
RemindMe! 179 days
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:30:12
Pissed i didnt get into this 2 years ago. Thought btc price was high then, had no idea it had this capability. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:25:14
I made my accounts sept 3rd or 4th. Took a week to sort of the verification mumbo jumbo, in that week it rose a dollar in value by the time i bought in on the 11th. Got my hopes up when it rose another dollar on the 12th, since have lost all excitement as wishy washy as it has been. Gonna leave jt alone for the long haul and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:33:52
Yes. I dont fully understand the other numbers. USD keeps it simple as i am currently under $500 invested in crypto. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:12:54
With 2 s9 t14.5 I pull .05btc about every 6-7 weeks. Slushpool fees are not even noticeable.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:09:17
Gigawatt doesn't use graphic cards. They use bitmain miners.
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:05:31
Yep, typo.
@_date: 2018-11-22 04:20:04
I think you are confused how gigawatt operated. They did not use graphic cards, they used bitmain antminers
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:21:42
Bitmain sells the s9s on Amazon prime now. PRetty fair prices. I'm into mine double or more what they go for now. Been tempted to get a couple others with as low as the price is but also been waiting to see what was going to be released next. And now I have to wait for the latest and greatest from bitmain to be available to order again. 
I do plan on trying to figure out how to heat my house with them here in the next few days, finally got cold enough to turn the heater on in the house.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:20:01
That's cool that chart makes the numbers up for you but this is real life scenario. I just had a slushpool payout today of .05btc, payout took 1 month 2 weeks to reach the .05btc threshold. Just got my last months power bill yesterday, where I had no HVAC running all month. Compared to the same month last year when I didn't have 2 miners my power bill was almost $100 more running both miners. .05btc to USD at todays price is about $315. So again, my 2 s9s make me about $200 a month after power. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 02:51:55
2 s9s make me about $200 a month after power. Power for them is roughly $100 a month.
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:04:40
Yep, just under. I think it's .0485kWh to be exact. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:06:49
They have a site in my hometown, where power is very cheap, with at least a dozen pods(probably more but I haven't drove by in a while) that have been built quickly in the last 2 years. These pods are basically small buildings, maybe 20'x40' on average, with big fans and power. Wonder why those cannot be considered assets? They could be reused for a colocation data center or something related. The availability of the power they brought in has to be worth something as well to the right customer, even though my county utility district will be jacking up electrical rates on cryptomining operations starting next year.
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:12:40
Nope. Considering the thousands of antminers they have are still profitable to use for mining in our region due to low power costs. Their operation could be taken over with ease by an interested party. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:39:38
Send me your miners then. My cheap power keeps me in the green
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:58:32
There is a literal fuckton of weed in WA. It's barely profitable to grow right now. Top shelf is being sold for about $2.50 a gram from a legal grower.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:36:28
The outdoor crops flood the market every year
@_date: 2018-11-11 08:10:12
Maybe about .02btc a month? Depends on what pool you use and how many you have running. 
Edit: .2 to .02
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:38:01
I got the feeling the guy might be a tweaker
