it's the Black Friday principal. The best sales aren't on the most advertised days, but when there's too much product to remain profitable, i.e. the weeks after major holiday periods. That said, I lost like 30% of my meagre chip in the crypto currency game yesterday... oh well, if I had more foresight I wouldn't be chatting on a web forum, probably rolling in my roi somewhere in the carribean;)

That's nice and all that a crisis was averted but by a central guidance of developers (abliet volunteers) seems like a dangerous precedent to set, idealogically, for the future of bitcoin as a currency as end-users voluntarily cede control to central authority.

The fax machine was pretty influential on the economy- the ability to send documents long distance in a matter of minutes compared to having to use a courier or snail mail was a huge leap. For businesses, I'd say both in 2005 and 1998 he was correct about the economic impact of the internet compared to the fax machine, not until social media becomes popular and cloud computing a reality does the internet start to become something more significant.

This thread is depressing. Unfounded paranoia will destroy the bitcoin experiment.

the real price is what ever anyone is willing to pay you for a bitcoin. Exchanges and their listed values are only the venues where people meet to buy and sell.
