this same scenario 'the bubble bursting' has happened a few times before and will continue to happen at least another 4 times this year. Overall bitcoin will rise more than it will fall for this year and perhaps the next 2 or 3 years. I have been working in finance for over 20 years and there has never, ever been anything comparable to bitcoin. This phenomenon, bitcoin, will not come of age and hit real mainstream for several months. bitcoin and every so called trading platform and related website is still in nappies! There's a lot of maturing to come, a lot of falling down then standing up again and learning from mistakes. While 1 bitcoin is worth less than USD$5k the whole scene is in infancy.

Yes for a few dollars a fool. Yet a few hundred thousand,l not a fool just nervous! Why be nervous anyway it's way undervalued, it's just going to go up. At least for the next 4 years anyway

Yep! we are no way near critical mass! Not even close When my stubborn dad accepts bitcoin that's when I'll be selling and that's a long way away. hehe

It has to be based on a FIAT and while it's gaining more acceptance and more use it's going to rise like hell against FIAT. That's exciting.
At this stage the FIAT is king and BTC needs to always be based on it. For  example, imagine a t-shirt is 1BTC, a few weeks ago that's fine but today that's a joke, it's a rip off.
There will not be any stability for the foreseeable future but there is amazing opportunity for some insanity.

I was buying up to $220 now i'm buying again. Didn't sell and won't be selling this year, no way!! I aim to purchase at least AUD$200 per week all year not matter what the price MtGox and their traders say it is.

Never tell anyone, even your parents, how much money/wealth you have. NEVER!!!
The lack of or the abundance of wealth brings up issues within people and they own these issues. Only be concerned with your issues regarding wealth or anything for that matter.
Please take heed of my words as I learnt the hardest way possible. My wealth did soon recover but my relationships will never recover even though I was more than generous. Yes I gave a way a good portion of my wealth and what do you know that wasn't enough. When I said enough was enough well I turned out to be the bad guy. Crazy but true!!
You owe your parents nothing but respect. That includes respect to where they stand financially, mentally and emotionally.
If you end up with a spare million, sure buy them a house to live in but keep the house in your name.
All the best and stay strong!!
