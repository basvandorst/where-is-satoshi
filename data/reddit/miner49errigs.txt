Actually, if you paid $1500 for 1300kH/s...  then you and I are the same.
Well, I would have charged $1535
however, with me you also get: 
* a custom, open-air, aluminum case
* performance tuning &amp; testing,
* and, most importantly in my opinion, plug-n-hash - out of the box.

Sorry for the delayed response.  Hell of a day.
I try to keep my costs low... no website. :)  But I can get you references on the quality of my work from previous customers.
If you give me an idea of what you are after, I will build you out a quote.  
For LTC, I build out 615kH/s to 3750Kh/s. 
What hash rate were you looking for out of this box?
To give you an idea:
* 615kH/s : $1164 :
* 3.75Mh/s : $3138 : 
Or, if you want to let me know your $ range, I can back in to a max hashrate for you.

While I would say you "techie" comment was true in the beginning... the market is shifting.  I would bet if you surveyed those selling miners that they have seen the same.  My first 3 rigs went to pure techies.  Of my next 10, I would say 3 were people who "just wanted to mine.  plug and play".  And, based on this thread - I have 2 more people who just want it to work.
That shift is, not only, good for businesses like mine, but it also is a great sign (I think at least) for cryptoicoins too.  I want my grandmother buying things with a LTC iPhone app at Starbucks. :)
RE: worst part
Oh, I understand what you are saying... I wasn't arguing with you, just saying that these type of consumer is a good thing.

Oh, and someone asked... I do **not** use HD because of the power draw. These are entirely Linux BAMT run from a USB stick.
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:09:22
Sure, why not.
@_date: 2013-05-07 13:17:38
Really?  how cool. :)

Haha, thanks.  I appreciate it, but I'm good for now.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:39:57
Absolutely.  I'm in this to have happy customers.  I'll PM you for details.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:43:57
Nice.  That's a great business plan!
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:46:36
Actually, they ARE built to be supported by the provided holes - which is exactly what I do.  In fact, the way I have them suspended eliminates the shock of being hard fixed.
As for the GPUs, they are mounted solidly.  I've not had a single GPU mounting problem in any of my shipments.
In the spirit of full disclosure, I did have a zip-tie break during shipment for the motherboard support. But, that was my fault since I ran out of the heavy-duty ones I normally use and went with a smaller gauge (??) to ship quickly.
And the other 8 supported the board just fine.
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:56:06
Nope, did it myself.  Have 5 of em myself and they perform very well.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:47:10
Yup, exactly.
It would take a lot of force to really cause problems.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:43:37
Thank, appreciate the offer, but I prefer to keep costs low.  So far this has worked out fine for me.  If I ever need to set something up, I'll reach out.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:38:08
Like I said above... I'm building quality, expandability, and supportable products.  Can you build / can you buy cheaper product... yes, certainly, I never stated otherwise.
But I'm confident that if you did it yourself for cheaper you would spend a lot more time, frustration and hassle.
And, "worst part is [you're] sure people actually buy them"... why is that the worst part?  Good product for a fair price in a new technology... seems like good for everyone.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:34:44
We could race to the bottom, but I'm delivering a lot quality and expansion with my solutions, so I'll stay where I am.
I wish you good block-hashing luck!  The more people building hardware, the better in my view.
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:58:05
Very cool.
Are you making the PCIe cables yourself?
@_date: 2013-06-08 05:25:41
Thanks, I appreciate that.
They work well.
I'll do btc/ltc/paypal.  I dont know what venmo is, honestly.
Even though I hate paypal's business model - I think it is safer - reversible.

Sure. Happy to.  They are made of Aluminum L-Bar stock.  $100 a piece, plus actual shipping costs.
