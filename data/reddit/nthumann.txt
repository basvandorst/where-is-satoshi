In case this isn‘t a joke: Do not use this address any more! Your private keys are visible and anyone can access your funds!

Have a look at  and adjust your fee in Copay. Copay is really overestimating the fees.
I just sent a transaction with 130 sat/byte and it got confirmed in 5 hours.

Copay (lacks SegWit support, but runs on other platforms as well, very easy to use) or bitWallet (with SegWit support, more technical)

The only disadvantage is that overt AsicBoost messes around with a blocks version bits. That may be problematic when signaling for a soft fork.
But: Most version-rolled blocks only flip bits in a specific range so won‘t affect common soft forks.

You can follow [this guide]( to create SegWit addresses in Electrum. I‘m using it myself, work fine!
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:43:44
Not quite. The „bad“ AsicBoost is the covert one.
Covert AsicBoost incentivises miners to miner smaller blocks and reject SegWit.
See [this table by Bitmex]( for more.

What block explorer would you prefer?
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:46:40
That‘s correct! AsicBoost is just an optimization in Bitcoins hashing algorithm, so it can be used on all devices. It‘s obviously not worth mining a SHA256 coin with a CPU or GPU, but technically possible.

BIP310 specifies how a miner communicates with a pool. Currently not all miners „speak“ in the same way to a pool. That‘s why the new Antminer S9 firmware that activates AsicBoost is incompatible with SlushPool. SlushPool and the Antminer „speak a different language“ (when trying to use AsicBoost) and BIP310 wants to standardize this language.

Yes, Halong is the only manufacturer that currently officially supports overt AsicBoost. It‘s not known if other miners (e.g. Bitmain Antminer) are using overt AsicBoost secretly at the moment.
My site shows all version-rolled blocks of course.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:31:03
Exactly! Bitmain was/is suspected to use covert (hidden, against SegWit) AsicBoost. Halong is using overt (publicly visible, not against SegWit) AsicBoost.
[Here‘s]( a good summary.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:31:46
That would be pure speculation. "Unknown" just means that the block was solved by a pool, which couldn´t be identified or is unknown. In theory it could be a private pool by Halong, but - as you already said - that´s way too far out.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:12:28
Sorry, I put it missleading. Of course that‘s not possible.
I meant that there may be ASICs that support AsicBoost, but hide it from the public or are covertly AsicBoosting.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:20:31
Maybe can comment on that. Please correct my findings, if they’re wrong ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:16:38
Yes, I did and only found these blocks.
Interestingly SlushPool [claims]( to found the first version-rolled block ever, In my scan they only found the second one ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:38:33
Mostly yes. They mention version-rolling at one point, so I wasn´t sure :/
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:33:08
Halong is the only manufacturer that supports overt AsicBoost publicly, so that´s possible.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:04:46
Technically yes! Bitmain [states]( that it has never actually been used (on mainnet) by customers or in their own farms.
It should take a firmware update to support AsicBoost.
However, there is some speculation that Bitmain is using it. More: [here](

The version (hexadecimal) can start with 1, 2, 3 or 4. These are the valid block versions ([source]( That‘s where the „2“ comes from. As [implemented]( in the stratrum protocol, a version-rolling mask is set (so which bits should be rolled). When version-rolling (overt AsicBoost) is happening, a miner changes the version bits (the miner and pool agreed on) in the blockheader. These are the „F“s in the version. :)
