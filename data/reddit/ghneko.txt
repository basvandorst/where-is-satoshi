I suppose that's fair enough of a stance.

I'm a tad bit surprised and confused why this is getting downvoted.
Does't he have a point, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:04:41
I do.
Or I would like to. I need to fix my iPod's screen before I can make it my dedicated player.

Yeah, I agree something like this shouldn't be illegal, but isnt the dogma of various cultures that look down on this stuff something to be taken into consideration?
Like, I really do agree with the idea that prostitution shouldn't be illegal or looked upon with such great disdain, but in the interest of Bitcoin, I'd personally avoid publicizing this type of content so that we're not making it easier for opposers of the currency to use this as ammo to manipluate and exploit others.
Example: Silkroad. Detractors really got it into people's heads for a long time that Bitcoin is for drugs. I'd rather avoid giving them another opportunity, however slight, to try and link illict use as a primary function of bitcoin again.
Then again, I just dont have a lot of faith in people and I am not fond of risk-taking with certain avenues.

USAA is basically a credit union disguised as a bank. It's godly.

I want to go at it long term because i want to buy with BTC and help the growth and stabilize BitCoin. So if it takes a few months, Im fine with that.

How would one go about buying this? How many would you have to buy? I'd love to drop 0.6btc on this.

He's referencing the image ad we've seen dozens of times, guys.

I still don't really understand what a 51% attack is. Can someone explain it like I'm 5? I've tried reading wikis and forums, but the terminology is still a bit over my reach in terms of understanding...
