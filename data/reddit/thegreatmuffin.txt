I have no idea about the next six months, but I think [Schnorr signatures]( is a good candidate too look into. Otherwise, I think it will be smaller optimisations of features that already exist today: batching of transactions, especially by bigger players (coinbase, looking at you here! but also other exchanges) and improvement of fees estimation algorithms, which all wallets struggle with nowadays.  
I don't have a complete overview of the system obviously, probably many more things hiding in plain sight :)

Sorry, still struggling with the first paragraph here. What would"sufficient balance" be in order to receive $10k worth of payments? If I have only $5 in a channel with someone, I can receive more than $5 from my channels counterpart (capped only by the balance they have on their side of the channel), or is it wrong?  
Edit: I've been reading through many of your other posts regarding lightning and while I only rudimentarily understand them for now, you seem like someone with valid, thought out concerns besides the usual FUD and misunderstandings. Just curious, have you brought up these concerns with people actually working on lightning development? These things sound like worth a debate with people who know what they're doing :)

Not an expert at all, but I think it's a very very healthy thing when more nodes are being set up in areas with very few nodes (diversification of the network). Apart from that your location doesn't matter, but for the sake of privacy perhaps consider running it over Tor (if yours is the only node on the map from South Africa f.ex, it might be easier to make a connection to you etc). Again, not an expert, so take it all with a grain of salt :)

That's the current network map: 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:50:36


First of all, it's yet quite questionable if such "centralized hubs" occur, but if yes, they can't just take your money and disappear (they cannot steal your funds). And if they drop off the network, than yes, users who have had only one connection to the network through the disappeared hub, will have to open up a new channel to another node. Perhaps even this will be automated by your wallet in the future. I don't think this will be a big issue.  
Btw: here's the current map of the tiny mainnet lightning network:  
it's not even in its infancy, but I think it's already visible that if one or two of the well-connected nodes disappear, it won't break the network, although the people with one single channel to the network through this node will need another channel to be connected.

I actually am interested to understand that. So say Joe has a channel to Alice, and Alice has a channel to Bob. Everyone has 1 btc on their side. Joe sends a payment of 1 btc to Bob, which gets routed through Alice. So the new state of the network is: Joe has 0 btc and Bob has 2 btc (his original + 1 btc from Joe). Alice still has 1 btc, but is that btc still usable on her channel with Bob or does she need to close her channel with Joe, and then transfer that 1 btc to her channel with Bob in order to be able to pay Bob again?

It's a hit-and-miss with trying to get very specific, technical questions answered on reddit, especially if they go under a bit in a particular thread.

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:03:16
I haven't heard of anyone yet, but I hope at least some of them are following the progress and testing internally... In my opinion, currently the first pioneers adopting the technology will get a lot of exposure to media and the users (although obviously there are more risks/potential bugs involved, too), so it's in the best interest of the exchanges to be on the foreground of this new tech adoption.  
On the other hand, their first "rule of thumb" is to keep user's funds safe, so their approach will be very conservative. I don't think exchanges will be quick to do any kinds of experiments with their users' money (and that's a good thing)
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:19:45
Yeah, sorry, I probably should have formulated differently :)  
You are right, you can "pay" on the Lightning testnet to "unlock" the episodes. Assuming you know how to make testnet payments on Lightning: you just click on one of the linked episodes and then on "buy episode", which then will produce an invoice in text format (the long line of symbols and letters), which you can copy/paste into your wallet, or you can click on the qr code symbol and scan it with your wallet. As soon as your payment goes through (which takes a second or a few), you're good to go and listen to the episode. Hope that helps :)

I don't think OP's goal is to sow FUD, I've read multiple posts from him and they *look* well-researched and coherent, but I am way out of my depth to assess if they actually are. I think he is interested to help out the development by raising criticism, not striking me as a FUDster.

I agree, as probably everyone would  


I disagree. Although it's not idiot proof (and probably won't be for a long time, because financial sovereignty requires taking at least some degree of responsibility and education), it is getting there. Only quick examples, but hardware wallets and android phone wallets come to mind, also the lightning wallets seem even more simpler to use than regular "on-chain" wallets (no more hassle with fees, just scan the QR code and tap "send). It's a long game for sure and the brilliance and dedication of people involved, and also of the new generation of kids who will take it to a whole new level on the long run will make it better. I'm sure we're on the right path, even though we sometimes feel lost between all the reddit shitposting :) But that's a property of a leaderless system, I guess.

That's misleading. Bitcoin core is an implementation (as well as a vague term loosely used to describe developers working on said implementation), while Bitcoin cash is a split-off from the original bitcoin chain. You are comparing apples with oranges.  
As cryptocurrencies, there is bitcoin and bitcoin cash/bcash. There is no "bitcoin core" coin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:52:59
USD as a store of value has a different "risk profile", I guess. You are exposed to third party risks (bank failures, fraud, account closures, confiscation etc etc). Also you are exposed to inflation and the value of your dollars (or any other fiat currency) is heavily dependent on how much of it your government is going to print in the future. Hint: they kinda like to print new dollars, because it makes a lot of things much easier for them.  
Also, if you move countries to live somewhere else, try taking your bank account/cash with you. Or try convert large amounts of dollars into another currency. Your bank easily can say no, or ask for shitload of documentation (and then say no anyway) or slap you with heavy fines for different reasons.  
Bitcoin has obviously its own risks, but they're different and it's usually a very smart idea to hedge risks. But it heavily depends on the use case and many other factors.

Look at the lightning network here:   
It's still in development, but you can already see that by connecting to a single node, you are already connected to the whole network. You can reach (theoretically at least, there are still many things and bugs to work out) any participant on the network, and you can at any time settle your lightning transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.

It might happen, but as far as I understand it, the company in question won't be able to exploit its "hub status" in any way, because it's so easy for competition to arise. F.ex, if they start to charge slightly more -&gt; nodes/channels with slightly lower fees will get the preferred payment routings. If they shut down -&gt; payments will instantaneously find another routing channels, etc
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:50:26
That's a good question, actually. I don't know the answer :) I assume though that observers from outside cannot see "into" the channel's balances, but now I must admit I am not entirely sure.

There are already some companies/people running nodes on the mainnet. Here is the "map" of the lightning mainnet nodes from the view of the node if one of hose people: 
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:47:52
Yes, at least that's how it works for me in the testnet version of the Eclair wallet. If you already have set up a channel (which you call side chain),  not necessarily with the merchant himself but just with someone indirectly connected to the merchant, you just need to scan the QR code and confirm your payment with one tap. Ideally, most channels are interconnected, so you just have to open one or two and then you are already connected indirectly with many participants in the network.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:28:24
Very rough explanation:  
this is the current state of the lightning network:   
It's not "ready" yet (for non-developers) but you can already see that by connecting to one node, you are indirectly connected to almost every other node in the network, hence you can pay nodes (= people/companies running this node) by having a single direct channel to whatever node you fancy connecting to.  
You can open up a channel and leave it open indefinitely to pay other participants of the network. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:57:23
You can, if you try to cheat (that's the incentive to keep the node honest) :)

That's kinda a valid point, but it can be argued that bitcoin is not competing on those metrics. In many use cases the existing fiat systems or altcoins are quicker and cheaper (for now), but no other altcoin has the same level of security, immutability, decentralisation, censorship-resistance and amount of development work being done as in bitcoin (imo). So just a matter of personal preferences, I guess.

There are so many more complexities involved than just "testing transactions"! What about scalability, implementing change from PoW to PoS (is PoS even technically possible on a scale?)? How will node count be influenced when the bandwidth load increasing exponentially over time (compare how quick ETH blockchain grows compared to the BTC one)? Many of those question can only be answered after sufficient time has passed. It's highly experimental tech (as well as is BTC, but I am arguing that BTC is less complex and better tested, even if we just use the time in existence as a metric)

I apologise for bashing you before. Browsing r/bitcoin sorted by "new" one sees so much misinformation and outright scams, that my sensors might have gotten a little sensitive :)   
I think that's a good disclaimer, although I would have placed it at the beginning of the article, but I guess the reminder combined with the technical hurdles of setting up a node/channel will serve as a filter for people who are aware of the risks and know what they're doing.  
Also, perhaps add something like "bugs and lost of funds still may occur" in-between two sentences of your disclaimer?

1. Lightning TXes are not IOUs, they are valid pre-signed transactions. They are Bitcoins. Lightning Network is based on _Bitcoin consensus rules_. It is a smart contract controlling Bitcoin based on primitives enforced by _consensus rules_.  
2. If Bob doesn't have enough Bitcoin to send a payment to Charlie, Alice can route part of it through John instead. There is no need to route through only one channel. As well, Alice can send money from her channel with Bob to her channel with John if she needs.  
3. This situation could not even happen with literally a single channel. You have no idea what you are talking about.  
4. There is absolutely no requirement whatsoever to have a channel open DIRECTLY with everyone you want to spend money to. Did you miss the entire network part?  
5. Miners EXACTLY facilitate the transfer of value. Any value transacted on the blockchain directly literally cannot be transacted or transfered without miners. If Lightning Network users can be classified as an MSB, then miners will be too.  
6. People cannot just "steal your Bitcoin" in Lightning Network. The entire process of channel closure is literally enforced by Bitcoin consensus rules. You do _not_ have to run a fullnode to safeguard, all you need to do is download blocks.  
Punishment for attempts to steal are this simple: "Some TX in set X of TXes is in a block? Release penalty transactions that allow you to spend ALL of the Bitcoins in a channel."  
This does not require a full archival node. This is not insanely expensive. This is not in the slightest bit something that will _require_ paying someone to have done, and is not outside the realm of reason at all to run on your own computer.  
This is happening. Deal with it. Literally all Bitcoin Cash supporters have done is FUD social media and engage in clearly organized misinformation, all the while implementing absolutely no real improvements in their own project. You said you wanted competition? You got it.  
Now actually COMPETE.

There is no "price increase if you hodl", please don't take investment advice from random internet strangers. That being said, over longer periods of time it's more likely for assets like stocks to appreciate in time, but bitcoin is a new, unknown terrain in tech and wildly volatile in price, so don't trust anyone trying to give you any kind of price predictions.

Maybe you'll find some interesting material here:   
You can already play with the testnet version of the Lightning network. It's not that hard, opening channels is literally scanning a QR code and typing in the amount of satoshis you want to put into the channel and press "ok" :)

They don't need to open a channel with me, as long as there are mutual channels between us. Also, as I understand it, it works like this: the ATM has already a pre-funded channel, of say, 1000USD. I go and put a 100 bill note into it and the machine makes a lightning transaction from its channel to my account, which is instantaneous. There is no need for a on-chain transaction (except the one that the machine used to open up their 1000USD channel to the network).  
Again, I don't need to have a direct channel to the machine. It will work even if the payment has to go through 20 different channels until it reaches mine.

"Pull request" means that someone is requesting a code change being implemented in the bitcoin software. It doesn't have anything to do with how many forks there have been. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:10:09


Then why didn't they follow through with doubling the block size (NYA agreement), if &gt;80% of miners signaled in favour of it? They most certainly can't "do anything they want" to the chain. If they did, they'd lose users and profits, and that's what they're after in the first place. It's a balanced system, no users = no profits.  
The miners could all decide that tomorrow there will be 42 mln of btc instead of 21 mln, but no users would agree to that and miners would split off to a useless chain, while the "user chain" would continue to be the original bitcoin.  
edit: I agree (and almost everyone in the space does) that miner centralisation is not optimal for bitcoin/crypto. But it's not something that can be exploited that easily, either.

It's not safe to assume, no. If you are building something, it's safer to assume "bad" environment. In order for Lightning (and other improvements) to have an impact on the on-chain fees in a meaningful way, it has to be adopted and utilised, and even then it is not certain how big the impact will be. Although many people are optimistic that it will be a game changer (myself included), it is not *safe* to assume so if you are building some business critical solution or something else important to you. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:58:00
I don't know exactly what you meant, but I guess I was a bit pedantic, yes. I think it's a good thing though to remind people once in a while that the developers aren't a homogeneous group working on a defined list of priorities to meet the customers demands or something. Didn't mean to offend you or anything :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:14:11
Very cool! Clearly explained and very balanced, kudos!  
Two quite big blunders though: the validity of transactions is not verified by miners, it's verified by user's nodes. The miners have the task to build the transactions into the blockchain (although they of course also verify the transactions by their own nodes, but it's not their primary task).  
Also, miners won't stop just because the last bitcoin has been mined, because they will generate their revenue from the transaction fees (or at least, that's the goal, because otherwise the security of the blockchain will fall apart).
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:07:13
I am downloading it with bitcoin core on my laptop currently, I haven't seen where I could set this before I started... Or do you mean I need to set it before I import the mainnet blockchain from my laptop to my Pi, so the Pi doesn't need to re-index it again?

More information about the topic you are talking about (links, explanations). Also, if I may suggest, maybe try not reading from the script but try to articulate more on your own (perhaps having a few bullet points in front of you, instead of the full text). Otherwise it's very difficult to follow, especially for viewers less familiar with the subject.  
If talking freely is not possible, then try speaking a little slower and give some links/references/further reading material in the video description.

Yes, if your phone is broken/stolen before you transfer its contents to a new phone (even in this case I'm not sure to be honest, I never used this switch function yet, so no idea), you are temporarily screwed with the accounts you need the authenticator for.  
In this case, you have to contact the exchange and confirm your identity so they switch off 2FA temporarily and you can sync your new phone to your account. Some exchanges have temporary one-time codes (which you get when you sync up your 2FA for the first time), you can use these to log in and change the 2FA to your new phone.

Those are interesting questions but how do you see them being answered? It's like asking "how many people will be using bitcoin and in which ways?" before the genesis block was even launched and bitcoin was only discussed on email groups. Fun to speculate, but the only true answer is "no idea, wait and see".

This is dangerous advice. As far as I understand it and the folks at u/UKpersonalfinance explain it, every trade between cryptocurrencies invokes taxable gains (or losses, if you made a loss, obv).  
Also, you have to declare any disposal of assets over 40k, even if you didn't make any gains.

Yep, see my point 4 in the list below :)  
I collected some improvement suggestions while working through your guide, I hope they are helpful!  
1. Not sure if this would work on Medium, but perhaps structuring the article in chapters and numerate them, or numerate the lines or something would be helpful for reference? Like, if someone has an issue, they can just point at a certain chapter number or line number to quickly reference to which step they are at. 
2. It seems that there is some confusion under “write down your passwords” section. There is “[B] user password for root” but then later in guide it says “change the password of the “root” admin user to your password [C]. “   
I think going over it again now I understand what is meant, but when I was setting it all up I found it a bit confusing. Might be just me though :D  
And definitely a very minor thing. 
3. The link regarding MacOS built in ssh client under “Connecting” is not working (btw that would be an example that referencing particular points/lines in the guide with just a number might be helpful?). It just shows some stats for the site in the Wayback Machine.
4. When I copied the “testnet3” file from my other HDD to the HDD on the Pi, and then typed in “bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo”, it first shows up an error and it needs some time until it all syncs up. Perhaps a little note that you need to wait some time is helfpul, so that people don’t assume that they failed and open up another issue in the thread, like me :D  
And once again, many thanks for doing this! :)
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:35:50
I have exactly the same issue.  
The "getblockchaininfo" command gives out ""verificationprogress": 0.9999984384292571,"  
edit: and also the same output as LineRider with the command "sudo systemctl status eclair.service"  
edit2: I typed in the "getblockchaininfo" command a couple of times now, and it seems that the number in the "verificationprogress" line is actually getting smaller continuously (in very very small steps though, but it went from 0.999998 to 0.999991 in the last 15 min or so).  
edit3: the number went back up a little, so I guess that's just some random variance, nothing of importance?

This defies the idea of not relying on usernames/passwords. The authenticator is linked to your phone, not to your google account. In order to gain access to your exchange account, this requires the hacker to steal your exchange username/password AND your phone.  
If authenticator was linked to your google account, the hacker needs "only" to steal your google credentials (which is supposed to be much easier, cause both your exchange and your google credentials could be potentially accessed online). The phone creates a safety anchoring in the physical, offline world, so to speak.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:57:12
Awesome! Really appreciate your description, always cool to read about people's experiences in such types of "subversive" places :)  
Are there educational materials (regarding bitcoin) available in Greek language, or are most people versed in English enough to educate themselves online? Are there meet ups that try to explain bitcoin to people? I always think how incredibly tough it must be for non-english speaking people to find good information about bitcoin in their language.  
Also it's good to see confirmed that bitcoin thrives in such types of communities and grass-roots movements.. And that those communities in turn thrive on bitcoin :)

Eclair is my favourite, too. Yeah I guess user-friendly is a very subjective term :) I definitely have been expecting worse at this stage of development, was surprised by the slick look and "feel". But for someone who has no idea how bitcoin works it's certainly not user-friendly, I agree.

@_date: 2018-01-15 17:30:50
~~Just FYI: Zap, lightning desktop, Eclair etc, are not lightning nodes, they are wallets. In order to create a channel you need to connect to a node. You can run a node by yourself but it's a different process than installing a lightning wallet on your phone/desktop~~

That's why it's so dangerous. It depends on the definition of whoever is in power to decide what is suspicious and what is not. Besides: "there is no such thing as mass-surveilling "only" criminals. In order to deanonymise the "criminals," you inevitably surveil the innocent."

Holy shit, brains will be melted. I want to witness that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:41:33
Ahh, I think you might be right actually, that all (most of?) the channel opening transaction will be segwit transactions, so in this case, lightning would kinda contribute to "bigger" blocks. What I meant is that it wouldn't make blocks bigger by itself (segwit does) :)  
And also it wouldn't be able to make blocks bigger than theoretical segwit adoption of 100% on chain (without lightning). Meaning, that if all on-chain transaction would use segwit to 100%, lightning would not have any effect on block size. Hope that makes sense :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:04:40
Again same parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 4  
:/  I'll try later again.
Just out of curiosity: to send the payment I type "eclair-cli send [payment request]". But I don't have any means to check in advance how much I am actually sending, no? A shop will display the sum I guess, but if someone gives me a payment request like this, I should be able to check the parameters somehow?

How would a block size increase be helpful to keep miners around after block rewards end? I assume you mean it's because bigger blocks -&gt; more tx's -&gt; more fees, but you could easily make a point that with smaller blocks the fees increase (as we see now), because block space is scarce. I don't know what the correct model/assumption is in regards to miner's incentives, though

Bitcoin protects against those risks (and others that I listed, like censorship, confiscation etc), although it has exposure to a whole different set of risk factors and volatility. It is not a "perfect" store of value but depending on how the next years will play out (in terms of tech development and other dynamics like miner centralisation), it might become in the future. But even now it can serve as a hedge against a subset of risk factors, that fiat currencies cannot fulfil.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:55:41
The whole point of the bitcoin blockchain being reliable, immutable and censorship resistant is it to be very costly for someone to try and attack it. That's why miners need electricity and have to pay for it. Otherwise, if there'd be no cost to attack, the whole thing would be insecure. 
 If you have any idea how to solve this problem in another way, let us know :)

Nodes don't really "vote" on anything, they ensure that the transactions they send/receive/broadcast are valid according to the rules of the code that is running on the said node. If you (the evil developer) just create thousands of nodes with a malicious/incompatible code, the transactions of those evil nodes will be rejected by the honest nodes and that's it. The evil developer will need the other nodes in the network to install his code, otherwise he is powerless and all his own nodes will be able to do is to communicate with each other, which will create an own, useless network, separated from the "honest" bitcoin network.

Try to test the existing software (see the plentiful links in the OP, f.ex. the wallets) for bugs, issues and user-friendliness and report them to the dev-team. Learn how Lightning works, help out other people with questions.

The former is avoiding technical jargon, while the latter is explaining things as simply as possible (for children, or non-english speakers f.ex). The article is "plain English", meaning attempting to be free of technical jargon, not breaking things in an ELI5 manner.

Does every participating node in the Lightning network get to see this map? Is it possible that some nodes are not discoverable on it?  
Tagging u/chemicstry here, I think he's the creator :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:11:42
Very low bug tolerance. As u/dik2phat pointed out, it has to be thoroughly tested to ensure that everything is as safe and userfriendly as possible. The tech itself is kinda "ready". Also, the "network" part of "lightning network" has to grow (=user participation), but that's one of the unknown variables for the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:50:31
It's not exponential yet, imo. For now, only devs and very enthusiastic, non-risk-averse bitcoiners are running the nodes, and there aren't that many people with technical know-how how to set up a node etc. I think it's good that they're doing it and finding bugs, so the path for less technical, "dumber" users (like me) is more paved.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:09:37
Another question that I had: when I set up the node on the testnet and awaiting the switch to the mainnet, is it possible to download the mainnet blockchain in the meanwhile to somewhere else (laptop), so I can use the time until switching somewhat effectively? So I don't have to download the whole thing from the Pi, when I want to make the switch to mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:19:32
I can't formulate these questions myself, unfortunately. I'm extrapolating from two facts mostly:  1) Lightning has not been available for the "regular" user yet and hasn't been tested on a wider scale and 2) even such tested and proved tech like Segwit is not yet part of the native bitcoin core implementation, because the devs are very careful and thorough with updating it. So it's my best guess that it's "too far down the road". Not saying that it's vaporware, I'm myself testing lightning wallets on testnet with excitement :)  
If you want more detailed input, probably best to look through the dev mailinglist discussions and see what's on their agenda these days, or perhaps ask your question directly: 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:53:42
Almost every line from the video is so well quotable. I especially liked how he compared the 9 year old bitcoin to a 9 year old kid: still kinda awkward, not always stable and throws a tantrum every now and then.  
But it is growing up, even though you don't see it every day. And it will evolve and get better, that's just how nature works. We as "parents" have an influence in which direction it will grow, by choosing the wallets, the service providers, by voting with our money, by contributing to the code, testing and education of the people around us.

Hanging at the very last step!  
My channel (with "endurance") is funded and confirmed, but when I input "eclair-cli send [paymentrequest]" it says "parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 4".  
Tried it with different payment requests (Starblocks and Yalls).   
edit: fwiw, I'm getting the same error for this command as well: "eclair-cli allnodes" 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:26:24
I'm in a similar position and even similar set up, although much shittier internet and less than 70% progress. I have a feeling that it varies wildly, depending on the number of peers online and their connection, so it fluctuates back and forth. So maybe it'll pick back up after a while? I'm a beginner myself, so maybe it's something entirely else, just sharing my observation.  
Also, I need to re-index the database/sync the headers again and I made a similar observation there as well, that at the beginning process is quite quick, but slows down to unbearable speeds after a while. Although it cannot have something to do with the internet/peers, as it's just reindexing/syncing the already downloaded blocks. After re-starting the client it is again fast but then slows down horribly. No idea here :/

One of the truths in crypto, not many people seem to understand is: very many things/metrics are not subjectively "better" or "worse". There are many ugly trade-offs in tech/crypto. You can't have fast AND censorship AND cheap payments on a decentralised AND secure AND easy-to-scale network... There has to be an "OR" somewhere in there.   
So tl;dr: there are no "more technically capable" kids on the block. Any competitor claiming to be has an ugly trade-off hidden somewhere.

Imagine the bitcoin software like a glass box, where you can see all the contents inside. In order to run bitcoin software, you make a copy of this box and install it on your node.  
Around the box is a big group of people, proposing what to put into the box. There are five people with keys among them, who evaluate if a particular idea has a satisfying consensus status to be put into the box. Do they have control of the box? Keep in mind, the box is free to copy for everyone, so if you don't like what is happening, you just copy the box and go somewhere else and let other group of people put ideas in it. 
Similarly, if the group of people "around the box" don't like how the five people with keys behave, they just copy the box and go somewhere else and appoint another people with keys to put ideas into the box.  
I hope this makes sense :)

So when I do two ssh sessions and have "tail -f /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log" open on the second one, it just keeps updating something with "current feeratesPerByte" every ten minutes, even if I do another "send [payment request]" on the first ssh session. This action doesn't appear in the eclair.log file, it just continues to update these fee rates every ten minutes, regardless of what I do in the first ssh window.

@_date: 2018-01-13 11:17:08
I was thinking that maybe it would be helpful to put more emphasis on how to test things and where to send the feedback to, because so many people ask what they can do to help. Maybe even good to create a separate post with links to all the available testnet software and with correlating github pages (and email/Twitter addresses for folks without github, who are not into coding)?  
Perhaps this could help to accelerate the deployment a little bit, if we encourage more people to test and make it easier for them to do so. Because right now, everything is kinda chaotic and the hurdle to jump into testing is kinda big. What do you think, u/codedaway ?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:50:44


That's correct, but segwit doesn't have to be widely adopted (it doesn't matter if the majority doesn't use it at the moment).  


There is no particular list of tests being done. A few people are already transacting on the mainnet, but it's not feasible yet for users without some technical understanding and involves risk of losing your funds on the LN. It will be a gradual progress and companies like Ledger and Trezor will very conservative in their approach to adopt LN (if at all), before they are sure that it is safe to use. No one can put a date on such things :) 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:38:30
I'm sorry if I am being overly paranoid here, but I've read the full article and not a single word mentions the current risks involved in participating in an untested network, of which even the developers themselves currently warn to be highly cautious with users funds. How come?

I'm sorry, possibly misunderstanding your question, but if I send something to a "lightning network hub owner", he doesn't need to steal it anymore, it's already his? Or do you mean stealing the funds that I have uploaded into a channel with his node, but haven't sent yet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:52:27
Note that by not implementing SegWit and batching exchanges like Coinbase  
a) can off-load the fees on us users, instead of investing time and manpower towards solving the issues  
b) bloat the mempool with unnecessary big and numerous transactions -&gt; create even more upward fee pressures for other users   
c) have an easy scapegoat with "not enough blocksize!" "core should stop blocking progress!" etc, while being a part of the problem themselves

It's laudable that there are people doing content in other languages than English, it is very badly needed for non-english speakers!  
I watched it and it's all right to explain the basics. Just very minor points: I wouldn't present Lightning as *the* scaling solution, only *one* of the scaling approaches. Also, I would make it more clear that all the technical stuff regarding signing and routing the payments  is happening automatically and "behind the scenes" by the wallet, and doesn't have to be done manually by the user (a trivial thing for bitcoiners, but easy to misunderstand by newbs, whom the level of explanations of this video seems to address).

Hey u/stadicus, would it be possible to explain what the issue is in simple terms? I am still getting the parsing error message sometimes, but it seems that payments do come through after a while (10-15 minutes sometimes). Is it something that is faulty by the Eclair implementation and all we can do is wait for their fix?  
Otherwise I can send and receive payments over my node, which is awesome :) Although if I try to send to my own address from another wallet, I get "route not found" errors, although I do have a common channel with that other wallet (both connected to endurance). I guess this is all part of the same issue.  
Can't wait for the mainnet :) Currently syncing the mainnet blockchain on my laptop which seems to take ages. Any estimate when your guide will proceed with mainnet?  
Thanks a lot! :)  
edit: also there is bitcoin core 0.16.0 release coming soon: [github link]( Perhaps also a guide update how to update the node? :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:11:28
Damn, was afraid of that :/  
Is there any possibility of "outsourcing" this specific task onto my laptops SSD, which has around 80-90GB free space? It won't be able to hold the whole current bitcoin core directory that I already have (slightly over 100GB), but perhaps only the txindex task, that my external HDD is struggling with? Although the "index" folder is placed in the "blocks" folder which is already over 100GB in size..
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:47:38
Ok, I installed it. Quick first feedback:  
1. the "read manual" link or however it's called (when you first open the wallet) doesn't work for me (nothing happens when I tap on it).  
2. When I am opening a new channel, the keyboard field is in the way of the "confirm" button and the enter key on the keyboard doesn't do anything  (it goes away after I screenshot it though :D)
Otherwise looks good so far. Will test more  
edit: I especially like that you list the available nodes with their active channels, so I have a better overview right from your wallet to which nodes I can connect. Have been missing that on Eclair! :)  
Perhaps allow for some arraying function, to sort by most channels or so?  
edit2: also liking that you split the wallet functionality into "bitcoin" and "lightning" parts  
Edit3: when I try to connect to one of the first nodes (in the linked screenshot), I only see a screen flashing up (too quick to see) and then the error message in the bottom:

Wait, "connecting for free" is what the Lightning Network is all about? It's not your personal achievement, I can connect to any node "for free". *edit: they meant they pay your on-chain fees for funding the channel with them*


That's not true, you have to create your own node before opening a lightning channel... You literally describe how to set up a node a few lines later in the article!  


1. Using AWS launch a server [...]  
Nodes on a third party delegate all the trust to the third party.. meh  
Besides all that, you are not mentioning the risks involved in participating in an untested network! **The users are at risks of potentially losing their funds.**

Update request: you can make testnet instant swaps with bitcoin for different altcoins here:  it's as much fun as with Starblocks or similar! Even more so, cause you get to use testnets of some different altcoins :)

Not on the mainnet yet.  
But you could test stuff on testnet (you can find some wallets linked in the [Lightning megathread]( although that's still not yet very beginner friendly. But if you have an android phone, you could f.ex. download the Eclair wallet, get some testnet coins and play around with payments and report the bugs you find :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:11:42


lightning won't have an effect on the blocksize itself (but ideally, it will help many small-value payments to be transacted off-chain instantaneously and help reduce the fees on-chain somewhat)
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:52:39
I can use "bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo", yes.  
Sorry, I'm not sure what exactly I should type in with "eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser="raspibolt"? Should I put a command in front, or anything else?  
I checked bitcoin.conf and eclair.conf. The usernames were indeed different: in bitcoin.conf it was "raspibolt" and the eclair.conf had the name that I gave my Pi at the beginning of the setup. I changed it to "raspibolt" now and made sure that the password is exactly the same, but the initial problem (curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused") still persists.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:41:00
Lightning is neither "the only possible path" nor will it "solve everything". I don't think anyone with an insight into the crypto space would seriously claim that. 
I'm excited about it though, it certainly seems to a game changer!
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:20:59
I mean, "public-key cryptography" definitely is a large factor in securing bitcoin, but what is your question more precise? As of now, it's not very meaningful (kinda like asking "to what extent does math secure a plane flight?").  
Edit: in most basic way, public key cryptography lets someone, let's say Alice, publicly prove that she is in possession of a certain "secret" (private key) without showing this secret to anyone.

Well, I added the "txindex=1" to my bitcoin.conf file and restarted the client, but it is now syncing headers from scratch and this will take weeks and weeks to finish.. The progress increase is around 0.5% per hour :(  
I opened a new thread about how to improve that but unfortunately, it seems that the USB connection to my external HDD is the bottleneck here... I'm wondering if removing the "txindex=1" again and letting my Pi do the index thing would be actually faster in my case? u/stadicus, might this be a good idea?

Yeah, the more expensive ones have just more features for convenience etc (at least, as far as I'm aware of).
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:57:10
This isn't that simple. The bottleneck is not only the storage, but also:  
* initial block download when you start up a new node (the growth might be unsustainable when we think in decades)  
* verification process of the blocks: load on CPU/RAM (esp. with `txindex` enabled)  
* block propagation: larger blocks need more time to propagate between the nodes. This increases the orphan rate (a part of the network might see a new block arriving first, the other part of the network sees another block being first), which increases the risks of chain splits and reorgs.  
* this is a highly contentious issue which requires a change in consensus rules. Such changes cannot occur if there is no consensus (overwhelming majority), so things stay as they are until there is consensus

Congratulations, you just discovered why futures markets are important :)  
If you a merchant dealing with bitcoin (or any other goods like wheat, raw metal, whatever), you can hedge your risk by shorting it on the futures market. So if most of your business holdings are in bitcoin (wheat, raw metal, whatever), you can take like, 10% of it and go short on the futures to offset the volatility. This way, you're good whichever direction the price goes.

Yes, there are already three functional (on testnet), user-friendly lightning wallets that I know of: Zap, Eclair and HTLC. You can already check them out (see the links in the OP) and give your feedback to the dev team. You'd be surprised how easy they are to use, at least I was! :) (If you are already a bitcoin user, otherwise it needs a little more time to navigate)
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:55:32


There is some misunderstanding here. You don't need "unlimited channels" (why would you?). You are free to run your own, permissionless and free node. You are, of course, also free to trust a custodian, if you want to for some reason. Just as you are free to decide between running a bitcoin node or trust a custodial exchange with your coins.  


You don't have to  


You don't have to   


It's not a company, it's a feature in the software, which you can run yourself or delegate to a trusted third party, up to you. You don't even need to rely on it in the first place (just the fact that those exist is a deterrent to potential attackers, as they cannot know if you run one or not, and in case you do, they lose all their funds in the channel).

It's correct that running your own full node is better for your privacy, but it's not fully anonymous just because it's a "Linux box". You need to run it over Tor, if you want to be even more anonymous (without showing your IP to your peers).

OP seems to have deleted his post and his reply to me while I was typing a follow up, but here it is anyway.  


1) Due to how bitcoin is designed, "tainted" coins spread through the system overtime, until every coin is "tainted" somehow. There was a good video on youtube explaining this in better detail, but I cannot find it right now.  
2) Such ban on "tainted" coins is easily gameable: let's say a have coins that resulted from online gambling. Nothing stops me to send a tiny amount to a public bitcoin address, f.ex of a well-known politician. His wallet merges my transaction into his other transactions. Are his funds now tainted? Should he be held liable?  
3) it's trivially easy to circumvent: ok, let's say Coinbase bans all coins that have been on an online gambling site. How far back will they want to go? What about coins that have been on a gambling site two, three, six, ten hops back? At some point Coinbase will need to draw a line, and guess what, people will just send coins that go just one hop over that line. And what about coinjoined transactions?   
In short, "tainting" coins cannot work on a larger scale and/or with just minimally educated network participants.

No, if you already have a channel open you just have to scan the QR payment code, which makes a window pop up in your wallet, where the payment amount is already typed in, you just have to click "send". So literally, all you have to do is to scan the QR code and confirm the payment.
If you don't have a payment channel opened up yet (you don't actually need a direct one, if you have a channel already open with someone else, who is indirect connected to your desired merchant), you can create one scanning the QR code of the merchants node, then wait for a couple of confirmations and then go to step one

1) I think it's absolutely fine if you don't get a static IP  
2) if you really want one, you can also run your node over Tor, it gives additional layer of privacy and you get a fixed .onion address  
3) there is not much damage an attacker can do, if you don't leave any btc on your node. Look up into Electrum Personal Server. You can set it up on your node and connect Electrum to it. Then you can connect a hardware wallet to Electrum. So the hardware wallet verifies everything through your own node, but the keys are safely stored on the hardware wallet. It sounds a bit clunky, but it works. Unfortunately, it also requires quite a bit of tinkering.

Here's a detailed description why to run your own full node by Peter Wuille himself (source:   
------  
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

I see your point, but it's not a bad thing when developers and potential early adopters are hyped about this... Sure, it might lead to few things getting broken (bugs), but we'll see insane amount of progress, too, because many people are so eager to test and develop and help. And we can tackle problems early on, instead of dragging the debugging out for months/years. I'm optimistic :)

All you can do with the majority of hashpower is to doublespend **your own recent transactions** (= defraud merchants or exchanges). You cannot spend coins of other people, and you most definitely won't be able to "kill the algorithm".  
This will cost a ton of money too, btw. It's not as simple as gaining control over the mining equipment. You need to pay for electricity, too.  
I mean, sure it's theoretically possible, but it's not a scenario I would be particularly concerned about. If an actor gained control over the majority of hashingpower, it would be much more rational to simply continue to mine and earn money than to start an unprofitable attack.  
Edit: you also might misunderstand how mining pools operate. They pool the hashpower of individual miners, but the individual miners don't have to be in the same location, or even in the same country.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:39:06
This is incorrect on a few accounts. First problem: how do you define tainted coins? One transaction back from something "bad"? Two? Six? Ok, let's say six.. guess what people will do to "untain" the coins?  
Further, at some point, all coins (or a majority of them) on the network become "tainted", it's just how bitcoin UTXOs work. So the "taint" becomes irrelevant.

No, the receiving address is meaningless here (otherwise anyone you'd send the address would be able to access your bitcoin).  


Also meaningless here.  


Kinda... What you really want to access is your private key. This is the crucial thing here. It's either a string of letters and numbers, or a phrase of 12 or 24 random english words.  
Do you remember making any kind of backup for your wallet? Writing down the words on paper, f.ex?  
If not, you need to access your old hard drive and see if the private key is saved there in some form.  
An exception to all that would be if you stored your bitcoin on a service like blockchain.info, where you set up an account with your email + password. If you still have this email + password, you can log in to your account.  
Do you remember which wallet you used?

You are right in your concerns to enter your words on an online machine. That's why hardware wallets exist - the private key (of which the 24 words are an expression of, just in a different form) never leaves the device. You should write down the words on paper and under no circumstances store them online (and don't try to be tricky and "encrypt" them, still not safe online).  
Only enter those words on a hardware wallet itself.  
Android/iOS/Linux don't have anything to do with it (although one can make a point that Linux machines are better for security in general, but that's not the point here). Any machine that is (or will be) connected to internet should be treated as inherently unsafe, when it comes to private key storage.

A real conversation doesn't start with a bunch of general, unrelated questions, that each takes a lot of nuance to answer, especially when the one asking hasn't done any research in advance.  


Transactions are always the same speed (block time is 10 minutes on avg). The more transactions there are, the more fee pressure there is though (people are willing to bid more for their priority transactions).  


What do you mean by calculate? A transaction is constructed by your wallet (software), and mined by a miner (another type of software/hardware combination).  


Highest security (hashrate, time tested for bugs), highest decentralisation, highest liquidity, longest running and most attacked system, network effects, most developed infrastructure etc.  


It's not flexible, because the primary goal is to be secure. It is hard to change, if the changes can interfere with its security. And consensus-critical changes are even harder. If there is no consensus, there is no change.  
There is no need to keep up with "smarter" cryptos. First, there are no "smarter" cryptos around, and second, security comes first (and not "move fast and break things" mentality).

The seed words that Trezor gives you is your backup. You can import this backup into another Trezor, or a Ledger, or a software wallet. The seed words are not bound onto a specific device (if you made the effort to write them down on paper).

*Edit: just to clarify, this is* **not** *about a new hashing algorithm or some consensus change. It's about a new protocol regulating the relationship between the pool operators and the individual miners, contributing to a pool. With Betterhash, individual miner get more control what to mine and how to construct blocks (currently, the pool operators have the power to decide how to use the hashrate exactly).*  
This is an article by u/StopAndDecrypt on why the BetterHash protocol (developed by Matt Corallo) is important, and which currently possible attacks/collusions (from miner's side) it prevents, if adopted in the future. Very educational write up.

I don't think it's the most important point when designing your cold storage. It also depends on other things:  
- do you want each UTXO (or each group of UTXOs) managed by a different private key/wallet?  
- are the UTXOs already associated with each other in some ways, or do they have different pre-history (some acquired with cash, some earned, some acquired on KYC exchange etc)?  
If the coins haven't been associated with each other, I wouldn't consolidate them into one UTXO, because that's bad practice for privacy. Also I don't see a lot of reason to split UTXOs into different wallets/private keys, but perhaps you had something different in mind than I understand?
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:25:04


This depends on how efficiently you can run your operation, i.e: costs of electricity, hardware, set up, maintenance etc. It's not about the scale directly (you can join a mining pool where your payout is proportional to your hashrate contribution).  


This is not a "requirement". The network doesn't require anything. If a lot of miners drop out, the network doesn't suddenly stop.  
But yes, the aggregate electricity input has grown considerably. You can find some data here:

Just a couple of days ago there were two massive vulnerabilities announced(Meltdown and Spectre) that concern chips in almost every  computational device.

This is just to illustrate how buggy things can be even with millions of $ poured into research and development and decades of testing/reviewing.  
Ethereum is a new, experimental and a much more complex and less tested/reviewed network/code than bitcoin, so it's practically impossible that is "as safe as btc", given the amount of possible bugs/vulnerabilities. Just look up DAO or the somewhat fresh Parity debacle.

I might lack context, but "distributed data processing" in no way works better as centralised processing. There is a reason why we try to keep bitcoin's network load as small as possible: because distributed networks are horribly inefficient with processing data. They have advantages on other fronts (no central point of failure, censorship resistance, immutability, permissionless, openness etc), but efficiency is not one of those advantages, on the contrary.  
Again, I might be missing author's context here.

A hardware wallet will be much better than blockchain,info in terms of privacy and security.  
For maximum privacy you'd need to connect your hardware wallet to your own full node though (by default it connects to nodes of the HW creator).  
Another option (until you run your own node) is to install Wasabi Wallet on your laptop/desktop and use your HW with it, instead of using the HW's default software.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:14:43
Bitcoin transactions on the Lightning network are already anonymous, as no one (except the two parties) can see what's going on within a channel.  
Tor adds privacy on another level: your node's IP. By default, everyone can see your node's IP (f.ex when you post an invoice somewhere public). This gives out information about your geographic location and your internet provider (assuming you don't use a VPN). But if you run your node on Tor, your IP is not broadcasted. You get an  address that ends with `.onion`, instead of an IP.

I don't have any reason to tell you how to lead your life :)  
My point is that the type of transaction you are describing has no benefit for the bitcoin eco space as a whole, in my view. I don't see it as an increased adoption, either. Perhaps a "meta adoption", because it makes some people aware of bitcoin, but that's about it.  
It's just my point of view, it's fine if you disagree and I'm certainly not trying to get you to change your financial behaviour or anything :)

No, you can leave it on. The private key (the thing that matters here) never leaves the Trezor device, regardless if it's connected to the internet or not.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:20:08
A hardware wallet without your own full node (running on Tor) is not the most privacy-oriented solution (although still one of the best solutions for beginners, when it comes to security overall). Trezor's/Ledger's software has to contact their nodes/servers, every time you open it to look up transactions. This is avoidable with your own full node, to which you connect your hardware wallet device.
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:34:18


No, that's the purpose of hardware wallets: you can connect it to any machine, even a totally virus infested one, and your private key will be fine. It never leaves the device. Note however, that you **always** should check the address you are sending to **on the device itself** (as the malicious software would be able to fake the sending address on your computer).  


You don't leak information about your own addresses to Ledger's servers (the device has to contact Ledger's nodes to ask them if there have been any transactions to your addresses; Ledger will be able to know which of the addresses belong to you).  
You should then use the coinjoin feature of the Wasabi Wallet, which adds a layer of privacy. You'll need to make a transaction to Wasabi from Ledger first though (just opening your Ledger with Wasabi is not enough for coinjoin).  
See also this FAQ (there are also some guide videos for Wasabi on youtube):

nitpicking: technically, mining and validating are two different things. You can mine without validating (but then your blocks will be rejected by the network), and you can validate without mining (that's what full nodes do, for free).

Yes, copying "blocks" and "chainstate" folders should be sufficient, AFAIK.  
If you previously ran `txindex`, there might be a folder for that, too, which you probably want to copy over, but I am not entirely sure at the moment (cannot look up on my own node).
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:19:10
You can check your port here:   
If you haven't opened it, that's probably the reason it's not visible on bitnodes. Btw, your node will be functional even without this port being open. It's just that other people won't be able to download blocks from you, but this doesn't diminish the usefulness of the node to you personally.
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:00:05
What do you mean by "wallet mechanics" specifically?
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:55:18
If a mined block is invalid (= not compliant with the rules of the rest of the network), it will be rejected by all other participants and the miner in question will just have wasted a lot of money for electricity and hardware, instead of getting their "honest" reward.  
Rules are "enforced" by the network in its entirety (there are some subtleties though). If you run your own full node, it will reject the invalid block and continue to wait for a valid block instead.

The 10k figure is only "listening nodes" (ones that have port 8333 open, which allows other peers to download the blockchain from them). The non-listening nodes are currently at about 80k, according to LukeDashjr's chart:   


it's already not enough today, if you run an indexing node (requires close to 300GB, afaik).  
Otherwise a decent article. But: you mention all the VPS and Raspberry Pi stuff, but why don't you mention that you can simply run a node on your current computer? It's as simple as downloading Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org. Not everyone needs a dedicated hardware solution (although a Raspberry Pi node is a great one indeed).

@_date: 2019-07-29 14:31:40
You might be confusing a password with a 24 word seed phrase. The seed phrase acts as a backup, which you only need in case you lose access to your wallet.  
A password (or sometimes it's a PIN number) is usually something that is required every time when you start your wallet. If you lose your password/PIN, you should be able to restore your wallet with the seed phrase (backup).   


The private key (same as seed phrase essentially) is infinitely more important that the password. If you lose your password, you'll regain your balance with the private key/seed phrase. Having a password without access to private key/seed phrase doesn't do anything (except if you're able to access your wallet and extract the private key again).  
Makes sense? :)

Sure, bitcoin doesn't protect from extortion. With your bank money or gold in a safe, the government doesn't even need to go to you with a gun, they simply ask the bank to give over your valuables. In your example, the government still needs the private keys from you (if you store them properly). They **need your actual permission** to get access to your bitcoin, and you still have a choice to refuse (even if it's theoretical, as most of us wouldn't hesitate to hand over the keys). You don't have this choice with bank money.

Theoretically, it's not possible (afaik). But you can screw up your privacy by consolidating your addresses at some later point (if you spend the coins on the closing transaction together with the coins on the address that has been used for the opening transaction).

You could try:  
* a non-KYC exchange such as Bisq or HodlHodl
* find people to buy bitcoin from through cash (at localbitcoin.com, or your local meet-up)  
* use an ATM (look at  although not sure how uptodate it is). You need to accept high fees and limited amounts though  
* earn bitcoin by selling goods or services (perhaps even something that you could do online - programming, translation jobs, design... whatever you are skilled at or can become skilled at)

1) I consider your company's actions during the SW2X drama as ethical questionable at best and fraudulent at worst. Example ([source](  


Your company has been trying to sell a dysfunctional hard fork version of bitcoin (btw if users followed your advice, their software wouldn't even start, because the code entailed a [critical bug]( because it was a wreck of a program without peer review and consensus).  
Especially the second sentence of the quote is a straight up lie (and the first one is a lie as well - miner didn't adopt Segwit2x at all!). There hasn't been a word of apology of your CEO, nor even a follow up. I'm curious, are you aware of this or do you not see how significant this was? How can I trust you to be on the side of the users, especially if some consensus critical event like this should happen again? Why should I trust that you are on the side of users at all?   
2) Your company tries to push the BIP70 payment standard which has a lot of issues:   
3) I assume your wallet is a custodial one  
But yeah, my trust in your company is non-existent due to 1) mostly and I cannot recommend your services to anyone new to the space. Nothing personal :)
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:55:57
You don't vote for anything though. You ensure that you don't get cheated and ensure that you are a sovereign participant in the system. If suddenly hundreds of thousands of nodes came onto the network running consensus-incompatible rules, they wouldn't "overvote" the standing consensus rules, because the rules are not subject to change by a voting.

It's not up to me to say what's ok or not ok for you :)  
You just should understand that without your full node you delegate your trust and privacy protection to third parties. This is not inherently bad, but you should understand the trade-offs.  
The problem is, that currently it's not very easy to connect a hardware to your own full node. It requires quite a bit of effort and tinkering (although running a node in itself just involves downloading and installing Bitcoin Core software).    
Here is a guide for how to set up a node on a dedicated, cheap hardware:  (see "Bonus Section" for connecting a hardware wallet to it, and feel free to skip over the Lightning section).

Theoretically yes, but it's possible that Trezor/Ledger cluster your receiving addresses, because your wallet contacts their servers everytime you open their software on your computer. It's better to use Electrum instead of Trezor's/Ledger's software, or even better: run your own node and install Electrum Personal Server on it, so you are not dependent on any third parties. Otherwise you are leaking privacy to them.

No, it will be re-broadcast by other nodes automatically. AFAIKit'll the stay in the mempool for some days (I think it's two weeks before it'll be dropped, but that's configurable and also doesn't guarantee that some nodes won't keep continuing on broadcasting that tx).

@_date: 2019-07-24 14:24:45


No, there are different types of wallets, some of them are a "lightweight node" (also called SPV). SPV wallets have other trade-offs (they blindly follow hashpower in case of a fork, f.ex) and are less secure and private than a fully validating node. It requires a little more time to explain in depth but you can google differences between SPV and fully validating node (or "full node").  
In any case, a non-SPV wallet is ok for small amounts of bitcoin (equivalent to cash that you carry around in your wallet - easy to spend but less secure than in a bank). But a full node offers more security and more privacy, especially if used with a hardware wallet.  
TL;DR: use a hardware wallet, preferably with your own full node. A software wallet is ok (see the list I posted above). If you want a SPV or a non-SPV wallet generally depends on your use case. Personally, I wouldn't care about it much, and use either a software wallet on mobile (for convenient spending) or a hardware wallet for storage.  
P.S.: you don't "store" a wallet on a node. You connect your wallet to a node, which verifies the transactions on the bitcoin network. This node is either hosted by you, or hosted by wallet's creators. It's preferable that it is hosted by you (if you want higher security/privacy).  


This is what "pruning" does in the bitcoin core software: it "prunes away" a lot of the data after verifying it, so you end up with something like 10gb storage (I don't remember exactly tbh, might be off here). But keep in mind it still needs to download and verify the whole blockchain history (which is around 200gb currently), and only after that pruning can be done.

$10k will do absolutely nothing in terms of bitcoin price. There are some few millions in the daily trading volume, and miners mine ~$18 million worth of bitcoin **every day** (of which they have to sell a large amount to cover their costs).

You don't need to understand cryptography in detail in order to securely hold/transfer bitcoin. You need to understand some basic rules.  
First, you need a wallet that lets you hold your private keys (this means, no web wallets, not keeping bitcoin on exchanges). The safest form is a hardware wallet, but a good smartphone/desktop wallet is good for a start (it's better than to keep bitcoin on an exchange).  
Never let anyone know your private key. Don't reuse addresses. Always check the sending address twice. Don't store your seed (the 12 or 24 word phrase) online (store it offline on paper or a metal plate or something).  


You always use a node to communicate with the bitcoin network. If it's not your own node, it's the node of your wallet, which has privacy and trust implications (you give both over to your wallet).  


Every exchange is custodial, meaning they hold bitcoin for you (they hold the private keys). Don't store bitcoin on an exchange.

You should be aware that Coinbase might kick your account at any time. They are a KYC-compliant ("Know Your Customer") company, which means they are super allergic to anything related to gambling, sex work etc. So be prepared to be kicked at any moment.  
It's much more advisable to set up something that doesn't require a third party to process. Consider looking up into BTCPayserver: it's a free, open source payment software which doesn't hold your funds or your data, and they cannot prohibit you from using their software. They also have a super helpful and enthusiastic community.  
It might be more effort to set up, but again, you'll get plenty of help if needed and it's better not to depend on third party payment processors like Coinbase who can kick you out without further notice, so plan accordingly ;)  
You'll find more infos here:  and go here if you need any kind of help:

I think you're correct. Difficulty adjustment is key here. If bitcoin's security only depended on rising prices, it wouldn't have come out of bootstrapping phase in the first place. But yes, higher prices are desirable for miners, especially considering the halving events.

Well, you already trust your wallet (to provide a seed with sufficient entropy, not to leak the private key or sensitive information etc etc) in a lot of ways, except if you are able to verify their code and their hardware on your own. So it's kinda illogical to trust it in such fundamental matters but not trust them with creating a valid change address?  
In any case, I haven't thought this through too deeply, but one of the main points against splitting is that you create more potential attack points, more seeds to take care of etc. Increased complexity = increased failure possibilities.  
Perhaps consider a multisig solution comprised of different wallets? Might achieve the same thing in this context?

The btc chain doesn't split when someone decides to create an altcoin based on a fork of bitcoin. A chain split is when there are two competing, **valid** versions of one chain and the network splits because for a period of time there exist two different versions of one chain (both valid temporarily). A forked altcoin doesn't create a split on the original chain. It creates a new version, which is not compatible with the original chain.

Do you want to run a node on your computer? If so, you probably will shut it down every day (except if you leave your computer on 24/7). After this time, the node will need to catch up with the network, which might take some time (depends how long it was off). It requires ~250-300GB of free space.  
If this is not a problem, just download the Bitcoin Core software here and let it do the syncing:   
There are various other methods how to set up a full node on a dedicated hardware (which can run 24/7 without interfering with your work etc). See f.ex:

@_date: 2019-07-14 07:49:38


There are no coins that do this though. This is where your misunderstanding might be.  
If you just copy bitcoin's code + history (and tweak something in it, so you create a separate chain), nobody (or a tiny minority perhaps) will mine it, use it, develop it, hold it, accept it for transactions, build infrastructure for it and so on.  
Your question has it slightly backwards. You should ask: why should I use a copy of bitcoin that is in every regard (see above) inferior to the original? There needs to be a critical mass of bitcoin users switching to the copy, in order for it to gain traction, and why should people switch to something, and in a coordinated manner at that?
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:54:30


In theory, they should be the same, or at least controlled by the same private key (otherwise something is going very wrong).  
I assume for this set up you exported the pubkey (public key, xpub) from your cold storage wallet to the watch-only wallet? If so, the only disadvantage is that you entrust your pubkey to another software/third party. This is less bad as disclosing the private key, but anyone who have you pubkey is able to know ALL your future receiving addresses derived from the private key/public key combination, which is not good for privacy, obviously.

There are no "tokens". You are basically sending partially signed bitcoin transactions, peer to peer.

Yes, this is an unfortunate default, worth being aware of. It can be circumvented by running their Dojo software on your own, without connecting to Samourai's backend.  


Personally, I have my own raspberry pi node, with EPS (Electrum Personal Server) on it, to which I connect my hardware wallet over Electrum. It's probably slightly less convenient than a watch-only wallet, but I don't see a reason to keep an eye on my coins all the time (only when receiving transactions).  
Perhaps there are some other solutions that allow having a watch-only wallet being connected to your own full node, without leaking pubkeys to third parties? Haven't explored that area tbh, due to lack of personal usecase.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:57:35


Not by default (sadly).  
Also, regular bitcoin full nodes also utilize Tor (as do other critical infrastructure projects like Wasabi, Electrum Personal Server, BTCpayserver and so on). So Tor is an essential tool in bitcoin's toolbox.
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:58:43


Yes, that's fine. It might be though that the balance won't display properly until the blockchain is downloaded and verified, but this should be purely a displaying issue. The funds are still there on that address.  
Again, if you have access to those 12/24 words, you could try to import them into another wallet, if you're in hurry or just to check (but be careful with your choice of wallets etc, also storing your keys in an online wallet is not something you want to do with your life savings).

All transactions (without exceptions) are stored on bitcoin's blockchain - this is the network database, essentially. Every full node has a copy of this database stored locally. Since you don't run your own node (you should), your Ledger wallet has to connect to Ledger's nodes in order to ask them "hey, can you tell me if there has been a transaction to the address XYZ" (address XYZ is your address here).  
This means, Ledger is (potentially) able to see every transaction that is coming in and out of your wallet. I'm not saying they do, but they are able to. Ideally, you simply should run your own full node and connect your hardware wallet to it. But if not, connecting it to Wasabi is slightly better (imo) than opening it with Ledger's default software.  
Just to reiterate, your transactions are stored on bitcoin's network itself. But in order to "ask" the network which transactions have happened, you need a full node. Since you don't have one (yet), you have to "ask" the full node of Ledger. Meaning, you have to trust them and leak (potentially) sensitive information to them.  
Makes more sense now? :)
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:46:58
To send anything on the bitcoin network, there has to be a node somewhere. If you don't run one, it's the node of your wallet. Your wallet software can see your IP you are connecting from (and worse, if it's it a custodial wallet, it knows your address, name and other details) and link every transaction you ever done into a cluster, belonging to this IP. This makes the job of various analytics companies very easy.  
When you run your full node at home, it doesn't leak such informations to any third party. The node queries the network for you and no one else sees what transactions you are doing.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:17:16


It is open source, actually:   
What is closed source, is (parts of) the firmware/hardware (the secure chip element, or whatever it's called). The code is open source though (as far as I understand, at least).
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:29:04
Worth mentioning that running your own node (over Tor) + connecting your (hardware) wallet to it mitigates all these risks (or most of them) of leaking privacy to third parties.
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:01:48
Adding to that:  
1) Privacy is not a fixed state. One might be safe from certain analytics/tracking attacks at the moment, but this doesn't protect from mistakes down the road: consolidating outputs, linking identities to them, leaking your IP etc etc.  
2) There are very different threat models to your privacy. An average, lazy redditor without incentives might click through a few transactions on a blockexplorer, but a chain analysis company has a much more powerful (and yet neither infallible nor perfect) tool arsenal, especially(!) when cooperating with KYC-compliant exchanges.

No, the private key never leaves the Ledger device, that's the main advantage of hardware wallets. What the malware can do though is to trick you into sending to a wrong address, so be careful and always check the sending address on the device itself (there is an eye symbol in Electrum to the right of the "receiving address" field, click the eye).

Vast majority of our today's money exists in purely digital form. The fact that bitcoin does not have a physical representation is made up by the fact that you can transfer it anywhere in the world, without anyone being able to stop you, without borders, regulations and control of any government/third party. 
You can also transfer bitcoin on USB sticks or other physical carriers btw, if you *really* want it to be physical. :)


"Hoping" is very different from "hedging".  
Besides, I'm strongly optimistic about "the world" in general. And yet I don't have any doubts that bitcoin will be massively disruptive to current financial structure over the next years/decades, in a similar way like the internet was massively disruptive to various industries. Disruption might mean short-term chaos, but not necessarily long-term destabilization (see again the internet).   


Bitcoin **is**. It doesn't want to be or do anything, just as any other thing doesn't want to be anything. You or other people choose to do something with it, or not.  


Absolutely. Vast majority of people shouldn't be in the business of timing the markets.  


You treating it however you like doesn't defeat anything. Nobody cares how you (or me) is using bitcoin.  
It seems that your post is really well-meant, but you put in quite a few of topics that need some thorough discussion in one single post, so I hope you don't mind me (and others) cherry picking single things from it. There are a lot of misunderstandings coming through in your arguments and it takes a lot of efforts to address them all.  
I still hope you keep an open mind and keep on learning :)  
P.S.: no one has any interest to persuade you to "jump in". It's totally fine if you don't like bitcoin or don't see any value in it.

No, it's a company (or companies). Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a protocol, that's why nobody has dragged it into a court or a senate hearing after ten years of existence. It's just numbers, but Libra is a centralized company (or a conglomerate of companies), that's why its creators sit in senate hearings, although their coin doesn't even exist yet.

1) yes, good to keep things like that in mind.  
2) no, "taint" is mostly an illusionary concept people like to throw around. There is no market where "tainted" coins are sold at a discount, or at least I'm not aware of one. Although I've heard rumours that there's a premium on freshly mined coins without history, but I don't know if that's true.  
Besides, this would imply that all other, non-freshly mined coins are the tainted ones, hence making the taint obsolete (every coin on the network is "tainted").

My point is that if  such bugs can be discovered in very well tested environments, they should be even more likely to appear in less tested and less reviewed, more complex environments. ETH is more complex and less tested than BTC, hence it is more likely to have a broader attack surface. I'm not saying BTC is perfect, mind you :)

Holding **is** using. Some people disagree, but that's ok.  
Gold is mostly used for holding. My saving account in the bank is used for holding. Stocks, valuables, assets and so on are used for holding. Do they become "victims of their success" if they serve as saving vehicles and not used in daily trade?   
There is no inherent purpose in bitcoin. Use it as you see it fit, but if people use it in other ways than yours, it doesn't mean they are doing it "wrong".

There's a "Buidl Bootcamp" by Justin Moon, which costs money, but it also exist (in a very basic) form on youtube, where you program a really really bad coin and then gradually get to improve it, slowly evolving it towards bitcoin:   
There is also a "Bitcoin Core Review Club" where some Core contributors meet to review PR's:  this might be helpful, too (because you'll get to pick the brains of some of the heads behind the code themselves).  
Less related (as it is not about teaching development) but perhaps also interesting - the bitcoin developer mailinglist where ideas, issues, PR's etc are discussed:   
Also you might want to look for a bitcoin developer meet up, if you're near a city like San Francisco, New York, London etc.

1) you don't have to trust third parties to verify your incoming bitcoin transactions for you  
2) privacy (you don't leak your tx's to third parties/chain analysis companies)  
3) you need a node if you want to run or develop services on top of bitcoin  
4) you learn about how bitcoin works

There are multiple weaknesses with this plan, some of those are:  
* you have to trust that TrueUSD doesn't go belly up or has some other critical weakness. I assume it's some kind of a centralized stablecoin, where you are dependent on the issuer?  
* you are trying to time the market, which *will* end badly in the long run (= cost you money)  
* you have to beat the fees, and you also trigger a taxable event, every time you sell bitcoin (which you also need to beat in order to be profitable)  
* you take further risks by transferring your bitcoin to an online wallet  
I think there are too many risks in order to risk your precious bitcoin.

Well, there are worse things that you can do than that, and looking up addresses is not a crime... But you never know who runs those explorers and what data they keep and how they use it. There are various chain analysis companies that would find such data (IPs linked with address clusters) quite valuable. "Trusted third parties are security holes", and we've seen enough examples of data breaches, hacks and straight up abuse in the last years.  
It's easier to acquire a habit for good practices to preserve your privacy than to reverse privacy leaks (which is practically impossible).

That's literally (almost) all you need to do to use the Eclair lightning wallet :)

@_date: 2018-01-06 17:23:49
If you are opening a new channel with someone, you pay the on-chain transaction fees, just as you would pay fees for a regular transaction on-chain. But afaik, it's also possible to have someone top-up your existing channel (so you pay the person topping up your channel with fiat, or an altcoin, or a product/service), and also there are other "tricks" to avoid/minimise on-chain fees, like [channel factories](

Bitcoin is pseudonymous. But if you deal with companies like Coinbase, you have to give them your ID and other personal data. If you want pseudonymity, you either need to find other sources of bitcoin (use Bisq or HodlHodl exchange, go to local meet ups and try to buy in cash, or sell your work/goods for bitcoin etc), or understand how you can undo your tracks (this is not easy for a beginner and requires a bit of effort, depending on the level of privacy you want to achieve).

There are plenty of reasons not to use one:   
In case you really never ever use your bitcoin except one transaction, I guess you are fine if you understand what you are doing (creating a paper wallet securely is not that easy, either). But if you need to make a transaction out of it, or even **into** it (it promotes address reuse, which is bad for privacy), the disadvantages begin to show very quickly.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:38:18
How do you kill an algorithm?  
Besides, if a lot of miners drop off the network, it becomes more profitable for new miners to enter, so after a period of time miners simply will be replaced, even if such a hashrate drop off will cause some short-lived turbulences and media FUD.  
Difficulty adjustment is one of those wonderful things that make bitcoin work.  
Switching to a different algorithm is much more contentious. Simply letting the network doing its work and adjust as it is supposed to would be the easy solution here. It's definitely not going to destroy anything (except profits of miners subject to Chinese legal system).
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:36:39


In Jim's case: since it creates bitcoin out of nothing, their transactions won't "add up" for the validating nodes and miners. The invalid transactions won't be broadcasted by the 98% of the nodes, and won't be mined. And if they *do* get mined (because f.ex miners didn't check the validity of transactions for themselves), the blocks containing these tx's won't get accepted by the 98% of nodes. This means, the 2% of nodes broadcasting/accepting these transactions (and miners who mined them) simply fork off the network (they become incompatible, because they followed incompatible rules).  
It's helpful to remember here that every full node checks all transactions that ever happened on the network from zero (genesis block). If there are a transaction that is coming out of nowhere or doublespending in some way (creating more bitcoin than there should be), it cannot go unnoticed.  


**A lot** of people don't automatically update either for this reason, or out of simple laziness (or some other reason). Hell, afaik there are ca 40% of nodes out there that are still susceptible to the inflation bug, which was fixed more than half a year ago.  


This is correct. I think the likelihood of a malicious version making its way through the usual channels (code review, merging of the pull request, getting uploaded to bitcoin.org, no massive outcry on soc. media etc*) is very small, but a node maintainer should be at least be keeping an eye on the space once in a while.

@_date: 2019-07-02 11:00:09
When you re-do your setup, starting with a whole new private key is probably advisable. But for now, you could for example stop using Ledger's software and use your Nano with another software like Electrum or Wasabi. It's still not as good as having your own node, but at least your hardware wallet will query random nodes on the network, instead of Ledger's nodes.  
Then you could set up your own node and connect Electrum or Wasabi to it, so then you'd have: Nano -&gt; Electrum -&gt; your personal node.  
This requires quite a bit of effort and tinkering, unfortunately. But don't worry, take everything step by step and ask more questions :)  
This is a great guide to set up a node on a dedicated hardware (with bonus section how to connect your hardware wallet to it):  It might look complicated at first glance, but it's explicitly for beginners who want to dabble with more advanced set ups (you might want to disregard the Lightning section in the guide for now).

1) your bank account has nothing to do with Visa (nor Mastercard).  
2) tell your friend to sell his bitcoin (exchange, ATM, HodlHodl, Bisq, in-person meet up and whatever options he has) and give you cash in person or send it as a bank transfer.

I think we might talk past each other here. For me, "shut down" means "stop". While I agree with you that in theory adoption of bitcoin might be slowed down by banning it, I don't see by how it will be stopped. The question also remains, how can computer numbers and encrypted data traffic be stopped efficiently.   


If they try to ban something that they cannot really ban, they just make themselves a laughing stock and play right into hands of jurisdictions who embrace the technology and gain from it.

Generally, cutting rates means money is becoming "cheaper". With cheaper money, people tend to put it into other assets to protect/increase their wealth. So with fiat becoming worth less, the value of assets (stocks, real estate, bitcoin) should increase more. This is very generalizing, of course.

@_date: 2019-07-13 08:08:21

I briefly checked out your guide and I cannot recommend it to any beginner, honestly.  
Mostly because:  
* it is about "cryptocurrency" mostly (not bitcoin)  
* the website design is convoluted (the explainers are brief but there is a lot happening above and below them, difficult to separate info from other menu points)  
* most importantly, some of the info is misleading:  


Blockchains are NOT decentralised in nature. This is what snake oil salesmen want you to believe. A blockchain is simply a database. A database is not inherently decentralised or secure or censorship resistant. These properties only arise with proof of work, accessibility/verifiability from the average user (verification of the blockchain on their own, with their own full nodes) and cryptography.

3) that's good to know, I wasn't aware.  
2) &gt; BitPay.com invoices or the merchant website already detect your phone/computer's IP address when you pay.  
This is not a good thing, in my mind.  
1) thank you for providing your perspective. I'm not sure if rehashing arguments will be helpful here, but given what I know about the whole SW2X thing, I still perceive it as an attack on bitcoin's consensus mechanism, although I'm sure most NY agreement participants didn't (and still don't) see it from this angle. Looking through the NY agreement participants list again, I don't see any name that is relevant for me personally today (some already left bitcoin, like Yours). And no participant (except Wences from Xapo) recognized this as a mistake and took this as an opportunity to reflect on how consensus mechanisms in bitcoin (and open source software in general) work.  
In general, I don't see the value proposition of Bitpay, except perhaps for people who merchants who want to get paid in fiat, while giving customers an option to pay with bitcoin. But I don't see much value in that, either, tbh. A merchant who receives fiat (and doesn't want bitcoin) doesn't participate/contribute to bitcoin's ecosystem in any way (even if they provide a valuable service otherwise). And all it achieves is that people hand over their bitcoin  (which presumably will be worth **a lot** in some future) to your company.  
For the use cases which I deem more important (merchants get paid with bitcoin directly), there are much better solutions (like BTCPayserver), which don't take fees and don't track the user (or the merchant) and are much more privacy preserving than KYC-compliant companies. I haven't looked deeply into how your wallet works, but I assume there is also some kind of tracking or data collection going on?  
Perhaps I'm doing your company injustice; I'm really not the best critic here, as I haven't looked into it too deeply. It's just for things that I want from a bitcoin company, there is software that already does what I want and in a privacy preserving, "ethical" way without history of breaking consensus-critical protocols :)

This is a quite meaningless signalling though, as meaningless as when 90% of miners were signalling the SegWit2x preference, and nothing came out of it. I mean, perhaps it's an interesting statistic, but it's absolutely not comparable to a democratic vote.  
I think it's somewhat important to understand, because I see this thinking/analogy quite a lot (that you "vote" with your node). I get where it's coming from, but it's not good when people misunderstand how the protocol and consensus work.  
This shouldn't be misunderstood as an argument against running a full node btw, which is one of the most important things a bitcoin user can do in order to become a fully sovereign participant of the network.

I'm a little confused now myself :)  
So the watch-only wallet has the correct balance and the correct history? Does it show multiple transactions? If so, probably each transaction has its own receiving address? What happens if you enter one of those addresses into a blockexplorer?  
My guess would be that you are trying to enter the **current** receiving address into the block explorer, and this current address has 0 transactions on it... Because the transactions happened to other receiving addresses.  
Another possibility: which blockexplorer are you using? Perhaps it has difficulties recognizing some address formats (addresses starting with "bc1.." f, ex.)... Although this seems less likely.

I'm not sure what tattoos you are speaking about, sorry (disregarding that tattooing private keys is a very stupid idea anyway).  
Storing the raw private key is dangerous, because it's easier to screw up, f.ex by mistyping a digit/letter and not knowing which one. A word phrase is easier (if you lose a letter or even a word it's not as bad). Another format to keep the private key is a QR code, but it's also worse than a seed phrase (except a QR code is more convenient to scan when importing the private key into another wallet).

Yep. Architecture has proof of work elements too (building an impressive structure just to show off your power etc). Human relationships kinda do as well -  doing something romantic is a lot about putting in effort, showing that it's "worth it".  
What makes bitcoin unique though is **cumulative** proof of work. The more "work" you put in, the more secure it makes the PoW accomplished in the past - this doesn't work with coins or architecture. There are no layers of PoW.

I agree with everything in this post :)  


Also agreed. But (in regards to context discussed): I don't think that a centralized payment processor contributes to this network. The network doesn't grow or benefit as a whole, when another merchant signs up with Bitpay and accepts fiat money, even though their website says "bitcoin accepted".   
But this is just my totally irrelevant and subjective opinion, it's absolutely fine if other people disagree.

I'm not the author of this text, it's u/Aussiehash.  
But no, hardware wallets don't store the private keys in plain text. I'm not qualified to explain how they store it exactly though ;)  
What I understand that it's very difficult to extract the private key in plain text from the device, if you have physical access to it (although not impossible in case of Trezor - that's why you are supposed to create a passphrase, which acts as 25th word and is not stored on the device itself). And without physical access to the device it's impossible to extract the private key.

I have Trezor Pi shield, Trezor one, Trezor T, Keepkey, HW.1, Ledger nano, Ledger nano S, Ledger NFC, Coldcard mk1 and mk2.
You can't go too wrong with any of the top 3, however the passphrase, PIN, recovery and physical security are increasingly important.
Trezor One has a good new advanced recovery method where the mnemonic words are entered with a mouse by random assorted predicting letter grid boxes which is very good, surprisingly I found it easier than even keepkey recovery which randomizes the keyboard every letter.
Trezor one PINs are fairly weak, only 1-9 and their weakness plus the lack of secure element means a passphrase is mandatory.
The Trezor One initialization combines PC and hardware wallet microcontroller entropy (2 sources) to generate the seed which is a nice feature, but means the device must be initialized on a computer.
Trezor One mnemonic passphrase is entered in plaintext in the web browser which is bad for security, especially since Chrome tries to memorize the passphrase, and still shows the plaintext passphrase as a address bar icon after you explicity tell chrome not to memorize wallet.trezor.io passwords.  There is no way to keep the passphrase cold/airgapped, short of having 2 separate PCs.
The need to use Trezor bridge / removal of winUSB is annoying for use with trezor web wallet.
Trezor T by default only uses 12 word seeds which is a downgrade.
Keepkey is always 6-12 months behind Trezor's security so they are probably multiple defcon talks behind.
Ledger Nano S has mushy plastic buttons and a tiny screen, the device runs slower than Trezor and needs to connect to Ledger's own HSM to firmware update and to install apps, so if Ledger ever discontinues Nano S support your S will become a brick (like microsoft's DRM server for music/zune/etc).  Typing the passphrase in to Nano S is a nightmare, especially if you have symbols, mixed case, etc.
Ledger Nano S can be initialized airgapped by battery, because it only uses one source of entropy, with closed source firmware and secure element code.  It wouldn't be difficult to add extra entropy as seen with bitcoinpaperwallet javascript/mouse movement, shift wallet add user touch/timing entropy and factory added unique salt, also coldcard add factory salt and optional dice rolls.
Coldcard is bigger than the others, you'll need a larger storage space. Its translucent plastic shell is far more rigid than the others, and allows you to inspect for evil maid modifications.
The firmware can be built from source and flashed, but it is harder to verify the factory bootloader, but (according to the docs) not impossible.
What I like is the coldcard contains without doubt better physical attacker security, with a secure element and open source bootloader/firmware (unlike Ledger), it is designed to run airgapped 100% with microSD PBST skeleton wallet export and airgap signing, it has 2 sources of entropy like Trezor but without a PC, you add dice rolls to the secure element entropy (or rely on 99 dice rolls as your only entropy, which you can audit with python/sha256), it has tamper evident packaging, it has the best PIN security by far (2 PINs in sequence with a 2 word check half way), far more duress options including a brick me PIN, and the best Passphrase support by far.  Nano S passphrase is painful, Trezor passphrase is exposed to the PC in plaintext. Coldcard passphrase entry is seamless for letters/mixed case/numbers/symbols and BIP39 dictionary words.  
If you are paranoid, use 99 dice words to generate 24 extra seed words (then reset) giving you 4-6 fragments to use as passphrases.  Some prefer seedless security, like Casa, coldcard allows seedless mnemonic backup via encrypted 7z archive on microSD.  The coldcard handles the backup and restore, so the 7z never needs to touch a computer.
The only negatives for coldcard are : no vendor webwallet (must use electrum/wasabi), larger size (harder to hide), crap mk1 touchpad (replaced in mk2 physical buttons) and no shitcoins (which means less profit, less income for coinkite).  Coinkite is a 2 man company, unlike Ledger with &gt;$100 million VC funding and 1.6+ million units sold

It's more private because a hardware wallet by default connects to the servers of the device's manufacturer and asks them for addresses you are interested in. This means, they are able to know all your transactions and link it to your IP, and possibly, to your home address if you ordered their device to your home (not saying that they do that, but I wouldn't want to have to trust them).  
Also, you have to trust their servers to tell you the truth about your coins (when you receive a transaction, you are trusting them that the coins have indeed arrived at your address etc).  
With a full node you verify everything for yourself and don't leak privacy to other parties.  
Running a full node is as simple as downloading it here:  but connecting a hardware wallet to it is a bit more tricky.  
If you are interested in tinkering a bit, there's a beginner friendly guide how to set up a full node on a raspberry pi and connect your hardware wallet to it (in the bonus section):

Sure, it's technically possible, even with bitcoin, but this requires new nodes coming online to trust older nodes. So this does away the whole value proposition of bitcoin being trustlessly validated.  
Smart contracts have nothing to do with that.   


This seems to be the case. That's why people are very keen to keep the blockchain growth to a manageable size, so years down the road it will still be possible for new nodes to come online without downloading and validating(!) terabytes of data.  
This is super important, so we have at least a basis layer of people validating their own tx's, while people who don't care about it can use custodial services (credit card type of use) etc.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:40:47
They're both similar from the perspective of an average user.  
Ledger has a closed source secure element, which implies some degree of trust to the manufacturer, but it avoids certain types of attacks. Trezor is fully open source (even the hardware), but it is susceptible against physical attacks (where someone very knowledgeable gets physical access to your device). This in turn is avoided if you set up a separated passphrase (a very long password, basically).  
Chances are, you don't have any idea what this means and that's fine, these are somewhat minor trade-offs in design, not interesting for the vast majority of users.  
You'll be ok with both*. Probably I would personally tend towards Trezor (and don't forget to set up a passphrase).  
\* provided you understand how to back up and restore your seed phrase, and don't do anything stupid. User's fault is still the most frequent cause of loss.

@_date: 2019-07-13 06:57:39
I think this is only if you want to allow inbound connections. This means, to allow other people to download parts of bitcoin's blockchain from your node.  
If you don't have a static IP/don't have your port 8333 open, you are not missing anything and you can use all the advantages of your node. It's just other people cannot use your node to bootstrap theirs, when they try to download the blockchain.

@_date: 2019-07-05 06:24:26
Under no circumstances type your seed into a website!  
With a hardware wallet, the private key never leaves the device (it signs the transactions on the device itself). You are trusting the manufacturer of the device indeed, but most of the popular ones are fully or partially open source, meaning that a lot of people have looked over the code, opened the hardware, tried to crack it and so on. This doesn't guarantee a lack of bugs or exploits, but it's reasonably safe to assume that hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard) are safe enough for an average user (provided correct handling and backing up).  
For more advanced users there are other ways to minimize trust to a particular manufacturer (multisig with multiple devices, writing their own implementations of an offline wallet etc), but generally speaking it should be all right.

When you are buying something with bitcoin, you are presented with a QR code and/or a string of symbols, which is a bitcoin address. Scan the QR code (or paste the address) with your wallet and click "send".

Your receiving addresses are derived from your xpub key, but the key itself doesn't store any transactions, that's why you cannot use it on a blockexplorer.  
Also you should handle this xpub key as "leaked" - it's not as bad as leaking your private key, because no one can steal your bitcoin (or a shitcoin, in this case) with a pubkey, but anyone who has access to xpub key can derive all future receiving addresses from this key.

Sadly, there's not much to find about the methodology, except "A total of 13,434 consumers were surveyed in 22 countries.".  
I strongly assume this is a biased selection of participants (or simply variance), because 19% of 7.6 billion people would mean there are already 1.4 billion people who have touched cryptocurrency, which cannot be correct by any measure.

Every transaction on bitcoin network can be "tracked". The important thing is that you don't link your identity to it. By purchasing in person, it matters less that the coins have been acquired on Coinbase, as the cash transfer undoes the identity track (assuming you don't give your KYC details to the seller). But yeah, of course it would be even better if the coins would go through Wasabi or Samourai or Joinmarket first (and not consolidated afterwards).
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:07:51


How do you expect bitcoin to evolve from zero to an "ideal financial system" without going through a speculative phase, where its value is discovered and its value proposition gets battle tested?  
The same way that today's giants like Microsoft and Apple have had to go through a "speculative start up" phase. You cannot bootstrap a whole financial system/network without it being highly speculative in the beginning :) It's a a new, unchartered territory.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:24:05
Probably more ways to look at it, but maybe it's helpful to think of the first layer (on-chain) as the most secure, censorship resistant, immutable, decentralised layer, that possesses these properties at cost of throughput and speed. As you go up in layers, these properties get traded in favour of speed/throughput. The reason is that you cannot have a centralised, censorable base layer, on which you put uncensorable layers, this just cannot work.  
It's not about the speed/throughput in the first place, it's about keeping the most important properties of the blockchain on the most basic level, because you can't regain them on upper levels.

It's not. It's a potential threat to PayPal or perhaps even some governmental monetary institutions/models. But besides that... Libra doesn't even exist yet.

If you send the exact same amount (minus the fees) to and from Wasabi in two single transactions (one depositing, one withdrawing), any observer can make the connection that both transactions belong to the same entity. You should split the amounts and do it overtime, to increase your anonymity.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:20:53
It depends how much you'd save in fees and transaction times compared to on-chain transactions. Also, how much you'd potentially make up from charging fees for routing transactions through your lightning node. Also, it depends on the bitcoin's price in USD terms in the future. So it's all kinda relative. But generally, lightning makes sense, yes :) A lot of sense. You don't need to use it if it doesn't make sense to you personally.

You are very welcome :)  


Kinda, but there are different ways to produce the seed words, also you can use different word lists, even different languages.  
However, most current wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, and software wallets like Electrum etc) have converged on a standard called [BIP39]( which uses one list of 2048 english words:   
So the seed phrase is interchangable between most modern wallets but there are exceptions, f.ex the LND wallet uses a different method.  
Generally, you shouldn't be worried about incompatibility of the seed words, as long as you use one of the reputable wallets. There are also ways to extract the raw private key (a string of digits and letters), which should be readable by all wallets. Or recreate the raw private key from a seed phrase and then import it into another wallet.

- we continuously have blocks larger than 1MB already  
- nothing immediately bad will happen (probably), but increasing the blocksize will increase the load on nodes (downloading, validating, propagating and storing the blocks), which will have effects long-term (nodes dropping off, increasingly difficult to sync blockchain when you start from scratch etc)  
- this will be a highly contentious issue and probably nobody is interested in tinkering with a critical variable in a running system (see the last few years on the blocksize debate)

The standard implementation in wallets is that when you go to "receive" field, it displays a new address that hasn't had any transaction yet.  
Some privacy oriented wallets, such as Wasabi, require you to create a label for every newly created receiving address, which is handy for preserving your privacy down the road (you know exactly where incoming transactions came from and can practice good [coin control](

It's a pity Joinmarket seems to be less known. I think earning maker fees while offering a valuable privacy service is THE killer incentive (lots of people would like to put their BTC to use, esp for a valuable purpose), but it seems that the hassle of installation is a bit too much currently to keep up with Wasabi's popularity. You're on point with other explanations though, too (marketing budget, "shilling" incentives etc).  
I can only repeat myself that I really wish the installation process was a bit easier :) Hope it will be in the future.

Both are great tools. There are no perfect wallets, each implementation has its weaknesses and trade offs. I use both for different purposes (Electrum on desktop with my hardware wallet, Samourai on mobile).

There are no "power requirements".

The transaction times have always been the same: 10 minutes per block. It's also a common misunderstanding that it was "cheaper in the past": of course when there are no other transactions, it's cheaper, but early on the fee estimating mechanisms in wallets sucked really bad (still do nowadays, but less so), we haven't had better practices like batching and tech like segwit (and off-chain solutions). Also, with a rising fiat price, the transactions costs denominated in USD rise automatically, so they are higher in USD than they were three years ago, even for the same 1sat/byte transaction.

It doesn't contribute much to those problems. Here is what an extensive study by Cambridge (the study is not without its weaknesses, but probably the most well-researched so far on that topic) concluded:  


  
So given these numbers, I don't think there is a lot to worry about. I don't doubt traditional finance systems are much more harmful to the environment in direct and indirect ways. But nobody seems to research those numbers (understandably, because it's even harder to research than in bitcoin, where everything happens under the public scrutiny).

Don't do that, otherwise you'll lose friends right with the next price correction.

I have no idea how this thing will play out in time, but I don't think a network needs to "appear in near totality in one day". You could make exactly the same comparison with bitcoin's network itself and as we see, it just grew organically over the years and is becoming more and more decentralised (compare how easily attackable it was when only Satoshi and some few people comprised the whole network!).  
Also, the way I understand lightning channels to work, the whole point of it is that no channel can just steal/block your money, so it's not as bad as having to rely on banks or big, centralised players. They won't have nearly as much power over your funds as a bank would. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:58:56

Well, it's an unknown territory regarding consensus and hardforking and all that technical businness, and also 2mb will (probably) become full again very quickly. Where do we go from there? 4mb? Where's the limit? And what's the "perfect" ratio between safe, sound solution and waiting too long?

The first part is correct (about the market + supply/demand). Comparing bitcoin to paper money is not entirely right though: bitcoin has inherent properties (online transferability, censorship resistance, scarcity, portability etc), which are valuable. Of course, it is to be estimated how valuable those actually are (and this is what the market does), but it's not mere "faith" that makes bitcoin valuable.

Is this really possible to say though? I haven't been following it closely, but I am quite sure that the BCH network doesn't operate at full capacity and their blocks are mostly &lt;1mb (correct me if I'm wrong here), because there are not that many users. It's dangerous to assume that everything is safe just because some bigger blocks haven't created issues so far. It might be an indicator but not a fact, considering long-term sustainability (blockchain growth, bandwidth etc) in a heavily used/attacked network.

It's not a "Lightning Network upgrade". It's a new version of Blockstream's c-lightning implementation.

We'll need a block size increase at some point in time still. But until then, why not explore all possible, less contentious ways to scale that are not endangering the network (bandwidth capacity for nodes etc)? Especially those ways that are voluntary and serve for specific purposes (like lightning is great for smaller payments for coffees or whatever, while bigger, important payments are perhaps better to stay on-chain)

if countries have tough restrictions on capital flows in/out of the country, it hinders arbitrage.  
So f.ex., a lot Iranians want to buy bitcoin, so the price rises (because demand is so high). Normally, this would attract sellers from other countries, and that would keep the price in check (=similar to prices in other countries). But if those sellers aren't able to get their fiat (which they get for their bitcoins) out of Iran, they won't be selling bitcoin for Iranian currency in the first place. So these inequalities in price are able to stay for a while. Basically, higher demand meets the same supply (because no higher supply can be produced) = price rises locally.
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:52:33






I'm not qualified to answer that, tbh. I don't think it's stored in plain text as otherwise it would be trivially easy to extract the key with physical access. But again, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.  


Ledger Nano S f.ex has two buttons with which you can select letters from alphabet and type in a phrase. I assume it's the same (or similar) with Trezor. Coldcard has a keypad.

There are two transactions (they are called outputs... the source of those, which you see on the left side, is called input) on the right side: the one for the exact amount you wanted to send, and the other is a "change" amount that you received back. So don't worry, it's kinda like you've spent a $10 note on a $5.5 purchase and got some loose change back :)

I don't disagree that a merchant accepting bitcoin is a good thing.  
I disagree that a merchant accepting fiat from a payment processor is useful to bitcoin space. The only party accepting bitcoin is the payment processor itself, accumulating bitcoin (which we all assume will be worth much more in the future). I don't see it as very useful, but that's my personal opinion. If people use those payment processors and like to pay for their services, so be it.

This is not the best advice for a beginner. How would they know if a random "key generator" they found online is legit?  
A key generator being offline does not guarantee security at all... If it malicious, it can just generate keys that are already known to the attacker.  
Unfortunately, I am not very helpful myself with giving a better option. I remember there being a guide on bitcointalk how to generate private keys by flipping a coin 256 times, but it got completely torn apart by Andrew Poelstra/Andytoshi (mathematician/cryptographer) as very unsafe, see here:   
OP, be very careful with methods of creating keys yourself, if you don't know what you are doing. Especially be very careful with "key generators" or whatever else someone might recommend.

At some point it needs to be traded to Rial though.  
Anyway, I'm not arguing that there is no arbitrage opportunity at all for business minded people... I'm saying that the restrictions are prohibitive enough for arbitrage to happen on such a scale which would keep the price at the same level as in other countries. If this inequality persists on a long term time frame, is another subject, but my point was simply to explain how there price inequality arise in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:10:22
Yeah, I'm aware of that, but those far over 1mb seem to be the exception, not the norm, see   
My point is that it's dangerous to assume that just because there were a couple of bigger blocks it's all safe for the network. The load on the nodes and the network is probably much higher after the blocks consistently come out far over 1mb.

Great points, haven't even thought of the IP and the data retention!  
Especially if your bitcoin was purchased through a KYC service (basically, every exchange), law enforcement or anyone with access to your customer data on the exchange plus access to the data of node of the hardware wallet company, can reconstruct all your transactions from the wallet and link them to your name/IP.  
All this is mitigated (partially, at least) by running your full node (and purchasing bitcoin anonymously, if possible, or using other services such as joinmarket or Wasabi wallet)

The incentive is that you nobody can "cheat" you, and that you know all the incoming and outgoing transaction are valid, according to the network protocol rules that your node is enforcing. Without your own full node, you are relying on third parties, like your wallet's nodes.

Every off-chain transaction is basically a 2nd layer solution. There's also opendime, f.ex, but it is also targeted for rather smaller payments (although you can load it up with ten million USD worth of btc, if you like). I'm not aware of other 2nd layer solutions on such a broad scale as LN.  
Personally, I would always choose to receive payments like $5k on-chain, tbh. At least for now.

A blockchain is a database, or literally a "chain of blocks". There's nothing inherently secure, safe, efficient or decentralised about a database without further components like encryption and proof-of-work.  
Also, the article says:  


Who in their right mind would want to put medical records or social security numbers on a **public** database for everyone to see? And if it's not public, it doesn't make sense to put anything on a blockchain, because then it's not decentralised, permissionless and freely accessible for everyone.

The large stake you've been holding must have appreciated greatly in value, the network has been running flawlessly for over nine years, the user base is growing and there is exciting, new tech around the corner... I kinda suspect the developers might have a bit more of a clue what they are doing and how to maintain the network than a subset of users demanding immediate action, screaming for doom and gloom if nothing happens :D  
But a good thing in an open source project is that no one holding you back if you want to contribute ideas, code, suggestions etc, that's why we have come so far in the first place :)

It's not for anyone to decide how exactly you want to use LN, but it seems that it will be more suitable for small, daily purchases (coffee, phone top up, whatever), micropayments (fractions of cents, for web-content f.ex), as well for privacy minded purchases.  
Basically, it depends what you mean by "normal". But I guess generally it's more suited for quick, (almost) feeless transactions. I would say $5k transactions are not yet suited for that usecase (and the network isn't that liquid anyway at the moment)

Good wrote up on the first glance, but please, one correction  - you don't need to worry about bitcoin being "locked up" on LN because "everyone uses LN anyway", but because there is no "locking up" in the first place! You are free to close the channel and broadcast its current state to the blockchain at any time, and while you have to wait for an on chain transaction to  confirm so you can use your bitcoin, I wouldn't call it "locked".

Well, let's say you have one bitcoin and liquidate all at once into a shady stablecoin. Congrats, but now you have to pay something between 20%-40% capital gains taxes (depending on where you live). But your money isn't even in "real cash" yet, it's in some "TrueUSD" or whatever.  
Then, how can you know that you sold at the top? What if it goes from $100k to $150k? You missed a $50k profit.. Do you want to buy back in? Remember you still own 20%-40% of your liquidation to the state (plus trading fees etc)...  
Oh, and during all this you hold a huge amount of "money" in an online wallet (much less secure than a hardware wallet). And you have third party risk with TrueUSD. And so on.

As an average citizen, why is the burden on me to *have* to invest my hard earned USD? It's complicated and I am opening myself to volatility in the best scenario and to outright scams in the worst (and fees, taxes, incapable financial advisors etc etc). Most people I know don't have a good idea what to do with their humble savings and those hard working people get screwed hard by the inflationary currency. Besides, they are vulnerable to further reduction of their wealth any time the government decides to print out more money for whatever reason (fund a war, bailout a defunct bank etc). This seems unfair to me?

No, it's exactly the same as everywhere. Bitcoin is not tied to a specific location anyway.  
But fiat is tied to locations by legislations and borders. This means that for someone who only has Iranian Rial, bitcoin is more expensive than for someone who has USD or EUR etc.  
Vice versa, you could say that Iranian Rial is worth less compared to bitcoin, than other fiat currencies. Bitcoin is a good litmus test how your local currency is valued.

You don't **need** to run a full node (including download/verification of the whole blockchain) in order to use lightning.  
But: running a full node gives you the highest independency from third parties (for verifying transactions), as well as a higher degree of privacy. Anyone striving for full financial sovereignty with bitcoin should be running their own node.  
The best guide to do so is here:   
Don't feel overwhelmed at the first sight, it's just a lot of instructions for people who are not familiar with linux/command line and the whole node thing. Also, this guide describes the set up for a bitcoin node **and** a Lightning node on a dedicated device (raspberry pi). If you just want to run a bitcoin node on your laptop, you also can simply download the bitcoin core software for your operating system and let it sync: 
But if you just wanna play around with lightning for a few small payments, you just can install a "light" wallet (where you connect to a full node run by the wallet developers). For android devices this would be the Eclair wallet by ACINQ. I'm not sure if there's something comparable for iOS devices yet in a working stage. There is Zap wallet, Shango wallet and Sparks wallet, but I think they're not out yet for "retail users".

I haven't really looked into htlc but yes, it seems that you don't need to fund the channel on that site, so it looks more like a demo there. In order to play around with opening and funding channel, it's probably better to do that with Eclair, as it is more "authentic" experience (except that you use testnet coins)
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:52
I'm not sure, there is a little green square which I also have on my Eclair (lightning wallet) and that says "testnet" on mine, but it's not clear in the video if it says testnet or mainnet there. 
Here's a lightning transaction definitely on the mainnet though:   
edit: just saw that in this video the said square is brown (=mainnet), and in the OP video it's green, so it's apparently testnet in the OP :/

I made two test payments and one went through with zero fees and the other was 1 satoshi:   
edit: on chain fees for opening up the channel were 26880 satoshis (around $4).   
 
This sounds like a lot for putting up  $20 on a channel, but mind you that I could use this channel also to make payments to other participants, not only to Bitrefill (I'd probably put more than $20 in that case). Also this is all on testnet, I don't know how big/small the fees would be in "real" environment.

You have some basic misunderstanding how consensus and the bitcoin protocol work. F.ex, Lightning doesn't touch the bitcoin code at all, it's a different protocol.  
You are correct though that if **everyone** would want the cap to be increased, then it would happen, but in practice, such a contentious change wouldn't be possible (you should understand how consensus on protocol changes works)

If I create 10.000.000 muffincoins, and then sell you one coin for one dollar -&gt; boom, muffincoin has a 10 million dollar market cap (10.000.000 x $1). That's how the market cap metric is calculated.  
Yeah they factor in the trading volume, but there are lots of coins who have very low volumes in the top 100.  
The dominance metric by market cap is completely irrelevant and useless.

1: how many channels you'll need in your particular example depends on if the participants are interconnected with each other. If User A already has a connection with User B, and User B has connection with User C, by creating one single channel to any of these users you automatically have a connection to all of them. So f.ex. you create a channel to User A and you can send a payment to User C without opening another channel, because you are already connected indirectly.  
There are circumstances where you still would need to open up a direct channel to User C though, even though you are already connected.   
3: yes, in order to fund a channel (as well as to close it) you'd need to make an on-chain transaction. I'm not sure but perhaps it actually also would work if you pay someone with fiat or other means from outside of the bitcoin network, so that person loads up your lightning channel for you, without you making an on-chain transaction.  
You can play around with a testnet version of Eclair (lightning wallet), if you have an android phone (you can use an android simulator on your desktop as well). It's available on google store.   
edit: also you already can try out the web version of another lightning wallet:

those invoices update automatically after they have been paid. But also they update every couple of minutes anyway (the screenshot says "217 seconds until QR code update"), to reflect the most recent fiat to bitcoin conversion rate. So basically, there's no need to even touch the screen for the user, just scanning the invoice with their smartphone wallet and go pick up the order.

Well, a hardware wallet is a really good idea!  
But guess how does it learn about incoming and outgoing transactions, and how does it verify these transactions? Because it's connected to a node by the hardware wallet guys.  
Now, theoretically, they could maliciously trick your wallet into thinking it got a transaction, where in fact it didn't. Also, they could theoretically spy on your transactions (even though they might not be able to connect it to your real name).  
This is highly unlikely, but not impossible. You cancel these risks out by running your own node, and have the highest degree of independence of third party validators.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:50


That's still wrong! You can use (= your wallet will use) routes through other channels, if there is no direct channel to a vendor. So if you are don't have a direct channel connection to Bob, but have a channel connection with Alice, who is connected to Bob, your wallet can make a transaction to Bob through Alice's channel. You don't have to open a channel to Bob in this case then.

I also would wish for more communication and more information about the work "behind the scenes", but I don't have a solution how this should work (who could have the authority of declaring roadmaps etc ?) and also I don't think it's right to be demanding in implementing certain futures in an open source project that you are a) less knowledgeable than the people developing it and b) not contributing yourself in any way.

Do I understand it right that the second-round effects are hoarding and delay of spending in case of deflationary currency? If yes, couldn't it be argued that delay of gratification into the future is actually good for society, because it increases responsible planning for the future, and investing only in solid companies/projects/enterprises? I.e., inflationary currency increases more risky, mindless consumption/investment, just out of fear of your inflationary money being worth less in the future?

It's definitely a good thought to ponder. One better errs on the side of caution with those things.  
Maybe try stay as private as possible when selling your goods? Is it possible to sell anonymously? Or setting up some sort of a company that serves as a privacy "shield" (I have no idea how this would work in legal terms though)?  
At the very least, you should try to keep a low public profile and not flashing around with your wealth.

1. don't care, ICOs projects' problems mostly  
2. bitcoin is not supposed to be a tax haven. it is easier to hide from taxes, but that's illegal and only a by-product of higher privacy than fiat monies. You can use that privacy for whatever reasons, it doesn't need to be for illegal ones.  
3. that's ok, price cycles exist  
4. yes, complexity is there, but it has drastically decreased since the beginning and will continue to do so over time  
5. doesn't matter. media is mostly doom and gloom. gives them something to write.

Keep in mind: 
1. it's only for localbitcoins trades, not for other exchanges  
2. you have to click on the resp. country and then "switch to btc" in order to get meaningful data. Volume in the country's fiat money is less meaningful, as a falling currency automatically might make it seem like higher volume, which is not necessarily the case.

There is no "one solution to solve every scaling problem forever", it's a constant progress, and not a linear one, either. Andreas explains it pretty well here, as usual: 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:47:52


You are not wrong. The scalability is one issue, usability another.
 It takes quite a bit of effort just to understand how to set up a wallet and to secure your private keys (just look at the stream of uninformed people right after price rising, and now think how many more people are still out there who never even heard of reddit, who are not into tech at all etc etc).  
That being said, it all will come sooner ~~as~~ than we think. Paradigm shifts don't happen overnight, but they happen behind the backs of the uninformed masses.   
edit: also - education is super important! Even people who haven't been on board for long can educate complete noobs about basic security, why it's important to have control over your keys etc. Help out people around you who want to inform themselves!

If your employer opens up a liquid enough channel to you, you can receive your salary over LN, no problem.  
That said, on-chain payments work well enough, you'd pay a few cents fees for an on-chain payment right now, which shouldn't be a problem for a $5k payment.

Depends what you mean by "do LN"? In order to just make payments you have to be connected to a lightning node/channel, yes. But you don't need to run one yourself. If you are the merchant receiving payments, you have to either run a node or have a third party running one for you.

You still have to make an on-chain transaction to open up such a channel (see my edit) and for bigger/more important payments people would probably still be using on-chain. I don't think miners will be getting poor in the future :)

Yeah, re-using addresses is not optimal.

I haven't been using either of those two, but afaik Square allows withdrawals. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:35:15
The default mode is that you open channels with funds only on your side. If you already have made some payments, there are funds on "the other side" now, which can be routed through you (depending on your and your channel partners connectivity).  
Otherwise, you can only send payments for now, as the funds are only on your side of the channels.  
Depending on the implementation you using (LND?) you can check your channel's balance with a command. I don't remember which one, though :)
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:15:24
Not sure if I get your question right. How do you imagine "bitcoin" would be made compliant?  
If you mean a holder of private keys has been ordered by a court to compensate someone in bitcoin, f.ex, the holder either has the option to obey and make the transaction, or not to obey and then deal with consequences (jail, penalty, whatever). It's similar to the case that you have some money stashed somewhere, but no one knows where, so you either comply with the law and pay it out or you don't and live with the consequences.   
I'm not a lawyer though, and it's a new field.. And also I'm not sure if I understood your question.  
Either way, bitcoin as a protocol cannot be made to comply. Either you have a private key in your possession -&gt; you can make a transaction, or you don't have a private key -&gt; you cannot make a transaction. Very easy :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:56:22
And lightning devs!

@_date: 2017-12-12 11:34:59


This is my current understanding as well. However, it might be rational to keep some funds in a channel, so you are able to make unexpected, smaller payments quickly (as in the example of your sudden car repair). Comparable to having some cash in your wallet for immediate in-person transactions.  
edit: so just there's no misunderstanding: if you have some funds in one channel already and this channel is able to make a connection to your car repair man through other channels, you don't need to open another channel (= make an on-chain transaction). You can use the routing/multi-hopping function of the lightning network in order to pay for the sudden car repair.

I think it's not so clear cut with this number. F.ex, what if only 40% of the nodes will run the "higher cap code", but they'd have 70% of miners.. And 60% of exchanges will give the ticker "btc" to the fork with the higher cap? It's a complete shitshow then as well :)   
Besides, I'm not sure what your definition of "validating nodes" is. You mean, "economically viable" nodes or something similar? A simple "full validating node" count is very easy to spoof...

If you want to do it on your laptop/desktop, it's free.   
If you want to set it up on a dedicated device (such as raspberry pi, as described in the linked guide), which can be left online 24/7, it's about $100 (~$50 for the pi, ~$50 for an external HDD).

I was explaining someone how bitcoin works with a Samourai wallet and wanted to push a tx and haven't bothered to look up the btc amount in fiat and sent something like &gt;5 usd fees. It's my own negligence, but it would be helpful to see the amount of the new fee in $ (or other fiat) in order to estimate if it's worth it.

You mean, if 51% of validating nodes would run the protocol version with an increased cap? Well, then this would cause a 51/49 split between nodes, and then? Then it's also the question what the hashpower is doing, the users, exchanges etc... Validating nodes are not everything, especially if this is such a tiny margin.

@_date: 2018-09-09 09:11:03
A bank has control over your money, it can decide to freeze your account and not give money to you, f.ex.  
You have full control over your funds in a LN channel, while your channel partner cannot do anything to them without your permission. The worse they can do is to stop routing, or to close the channel, but you don't lose your funds in neither case.   
To answer the question from the OP:  


No, but you'd need a channel opened to you which has funds on their side. Either by the party who wants to send you the funds, or by someone else who'd be able to route the funds to you. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:54:37
well, it doesn't cost anything to flood the testnet version. It has costs to flood the mainnet version, so that's less likely to happen (but of course not impossible)

You can, but you cannot exclude the possibility of your 12 word seed being compromised if you use it on an online machine (like your laptop, phone etc). As soon this seed touches any online machine, the probability of someone else getting access to it rises above 0%, no matter how secure you think your machine is (hint: it's not secure)

But it can only serve this function if it is combined with something that is securing it (such as proof-of-work), developer support, and userbase, with a permissionless access to the verification of the blockchain for themselves.  
For everything else the best resources compilation to start with is

There are much more ways for you to screw up the set up if you go the DIY route, but theoretically it's possible.  
Also keep in mind that if you intend to ever send a payment from you offline device without bringing it online, you'd need to know how to construct and sign a transaction offline and then broadcast it from another, online, machine. A hardware wallet does all this automatically for you.

Be careful here. What might be a valid approach in one country, might be bad/illegal in your own country. Better to ask a tax specialist from your own jurisdiction.   
For a payment processing system I'd highly recommend BTCPay, it's an open source software which you can implement on your website. It requires a bit of tinkering, but you'll save a lot on fees and won't be dependent on third party payment processors:

It doesn't become unstable. Large payments might not come through though, because the liquidity on the network is not very high yet, as it's still only in beta phases, but the funds will just stay in your wallet and won't move anywhere on the network in this case. Smaller payments have been working beautifully for me lately.

It's not a hope. For me, it's uncensorable, permissionless, difficult-to-confiscate store of value/savings, which I can take over borders with me without asking anyone, and store without supply being inflated by a third party. This is already reality for me, no hope necessary.  
 I'm also convinced that the price will go up long-term, but it's not the only thing why I'm holding it.

This is a seriously flawed thinking that might cause losses of funds.  
The time we've spent in bear market doesn't indicate **anything** on how long it will last for the future. It might last for one more month, or for the next five years. Also, you have no idea when the bull market will start. You can make guesses of course, but it's just same as throwing dice.

Yes in theory, but the 10 minutes time frame is only an **average**. That means, time between blocks can be 1 minute or 20 minutes, or even longer, or anything inbetween. It's just some mathematical variance playing into it, but the expected timeframe would be 10 minutes indeed.  
Like, if you throw a coin ten times, your expected result would be 5 heads and 5 tails, but in real world you'd frequently see 6 heads 4 tails, 3 heads 7 tails and all that. If you'd throw a coin a thousand times, the real world results would be closer to the expected result.  
Same with blocks: if you take the times of the last, say 1000 blocks, they'd be pretty close to an average time of 10 minutes, but the single blocks within this samplesize can deviate quite strongly from the expected value.

They haven't implemented SegWit yet, which lets you save transaction fees and is a technology now used by every "modern" bitcoin wallet. They have been touting since a year or something that they're "segwit ready", and yet failed to implement it, which tells you a bit about their priorities/dev team skills.  
Also, online wallets are inherently insecure, especially those you access through your browser, such as blockchain,info

- We have a bus that is so awesome that many people want to get on it! But nowadays it has become so full with passengers that it has become difficult to get the speed up to the level that it can take the highway.  
- Shouldn't we just put in an engine that's two times more powerful than the current one?
- Sure, that would be the most obvious solution. But have you thought about the other components? What about the suspensions, will they hold when we hit 120 mph on the highway? What about the seats on the bus, will the passengers be safe during high speeds? Shouldn't we think through about all the possibilities of going high speed with a full bus before implementing a solution that seems the most obvious one to a layman, but could potentially wreck every passenger on board?  
Why not prepare every other thing we can think of before implementing the "engine solution", to make our journey as safe and efficient as possible?

Are you or your friend concerned about your privacy? The easiest solution would be to use KYC compliant ways, but you both might lose a degree of your privacy in the process.  
If that's not of concern, your friend can set up a Wirex wallet, it has a btc address in it.. You send btc onto this address and he cashes from Wirex to bank.  
Again, note that this involves your friend giving his address, name etc to Wirex.  
More private solution would be for him to set up a wallet on his own, receive bitcoin from you, and then sell it on a p2p market (= to someone in person). Which is obviously a bit more tricky and involves more research/patience, but is more anonymous.

permissionless, uncensorable, immutable, borderless, decentralised are quite good arguments in themselves. The market values it at roughly $6000 USD right now..

I'm all for the SoV argument, but bitcoin in its current form is a product of incessant hard developing work (both protocol and infrastructure), and all the properties that make bitcoin valuable (permissionless, censorship resistance, pseudonymity, decentralisation etc) are derived from this work.  
 An ETF doesn't contribute anything to it. I'd rather have people building stuff and continue to develop the code than ETFs. Protocol development, translations, user-friendliness, developing BTC further as payment system (LN network!) etc etc is much more valuable, imo.

Joinmarket is a project to improve the privacy and fungibility in bitcoin. Essentially, it allows different participants to combine (mix) their transactions into one, making it harder for observers (such as chainalysis software) to track transactions and identify whom a particular input/output belongs to.  
Participants interested in combining their transactions can do so on a kind of market (hence 'JoinMarket'). Market makers can earn small fees by providing liquidity to the market. 
It's an interesting and very needed work regarding privacy.

As I understand it, you meant that usage of bitcoin in retail kinda provides a price finding/price stabilizing mechanism?  
But isn't that a bit of a chicken&amp;egg problem? The price is currently too volatile, so merchants are hesitant to accept it... But in your opinion, they need to do so to provide stability?  
On a related note: do you think bitcoin need to optimize more for being a payment system (instead of the SoV aspect)?

I'm aware of that. They don't give you access to private keys, nor do they let you withdraw your crypto funds, hence I'd argue they don't really allow you to buy/sell/trade crypto. All they sell you is an IOU pegged to the price of bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-08-22 13:13:52
Appreciate the input by an economist.


I disagree here. SoV for me means something that cannot be changed, cannot be censored, cannot be inflated, something that is durable, immutable, easily transferrable, fungible and very difficult to confiscate. Bitcoin has all these properties. Fiat money does not.  
I'd argue the price volatility in terms of fiat is a function of a very young system and will smooth out over time. 
Also, fiat monies are subject to relentless inflation. How do you even "store value" in something that is approaching zero long-term?    
Also, what do you think about the argument, that store of value comes first, then medium of exchange follows, then medium of account? Bitcoin is only developing its "medium of exchange" property, which is not very good at the moment (fiat is easier to use for avg person), but its much more sought after as store of value. I'd argue that once the SoV property is developed more and the fiat price is more stable, medium of exchange property will follow.

If you set your mind on buying bitcoin, your best bet is to get some and forget about it for a year or two (or longer). Don't try to time the market or to trade, it's a losing proposition.  
Learn about proper storage (many bitcoins have been lost or stolen due to bad storage). Start here to browse for topics that catch your attention (don't feel overwhelmed by the volume of articles, and also don't despair if you encounter difficulties in understanding... ask questions!):

It's like an eternity in bitcoin, and things happen/change so quickly here but I'll entertain your question.  
Strengths:  
- battle hardened enough to play a role of a settlement layer in international payments, and to accomodate national actors' requirements.  
- liquidity/adoption high enough to dampen the volatility (-&gt; further evolution to be a medium of exchange and an even better store of value than it is now)  
weaknesses:  
- the majority of users don't hold their own private keys and don't understand the importance of it, delegating the responsibilities/advantages to third parties  
- such third parties can potentially wield an unhealthy amount of power over the users who don't hold their own private keys

That's wrong. Remember, unregulated doesn't mean you are free to do whatever you like, because law still applies. Common misconception.  
A crime is still a crime, even if the area where this crime happened is an unregulated one. Obviously, the intricacies might vary, and different jurisdictions have different laws, but you won't get away with "but I thought it's unregulated and law-free!" excuse when committing crime.

How is a rock a store of value? Is it scarce? Is the supply fixed? Is the supply controlled by a third party? Can it be stored easily (do you wanna keep a pile of rocks at your home)? Can it be transferred over large distances and over borders within seconds? Can it be highly divisible? Can it be portable? etc etc

It depends. If the person controlling this address moves the coins to a known exchange, while using his real name to register at this exchange, it would be very easy, obviously.  
In reality, the person/group in question will probably take steps to anonymize the transaction (sending the coins through different addresses etc). Still, sophisticated tracking tools (often referred to as "chainalysis" tools) can make privacy much harder, but I guess with enough knowledge anonymization is possible nevertheless.

Bitcoin as protocol, protocol implementation, and its infrastructure, is very far away from being "perfect" (whatever this means in particular). There are a lot of things to be worked out still, like mining centralisation, scalability, usability etc etc etc.

Yes, markets/traders are important for price finding mechanisms, but it doesn't do much for hobby traders, who will lose money long-term. Hobby traders provide inefficiencies in markets, which can be exploited by more skilled, professional players.

No merchant where I paid with btc did actually wait for confirmations.  Obviously, if I was purchasing larger things (car, house...) they very likely would, but for something like &lt;$100 no sane merchant would want to let their customer wait for confirmations.  
By the way, transactions on your legacy banking system are not settled even after days. You still can reverse them even later. If you really would want to scam a merchant, you'd just call your bank and came up with a bullshit story, and they very likely reverse your card transaction.

Nope, China has a lot of hydro power, and since dams frequently produce a surplus of energy, bitcoin mining is an excellent way to monetize it. Especially since miners are not overly location bound and can set up near the dam itself.

2nd question: you can get fees, but you need to have a few channels and the default fees are 1 sat per hop (which is a fraction of 1 penny), so you'd need to route a lot of transactions to get some considerable sum from fees.

Different set of incentives. While implementation of segwit had some financial incentives (lower fees), it wasn't a life-or-death situation, and also it was subject to some political games.  
But when the whole network (and in particular, your own wallet balance) becomes vulnerable to being attacked/stolen with help of quantum computing, you will be soft forking as fast as you can.
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:26:28


Fixed :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:33:11
Correct. Cryptographic and decentralized system require a lot of trade-offs. If you f.ex make transactions much faster (f.ex by decreasing the average block size creation from 10 min to 30 seconds), you loose a degree of decentralization, because user's nodes have to process a higher load and potentially drop off the network.  
So almost every new feature an altcoin might tout, is mostly at cost of security or decentralization or both. Or they simply haven't reached a point where they could prove their features, because they don't have a critical mass of users yet, so every claim is highly theoretical.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:29:11
They have very active/engaged developer and user community and I've never heard of any heavy bugs, so it seems like it's safe (as safe as a phone wallet can be) and with a whole bunch of privacy-protection features.

If I'm not a miner, how would I know that a bitcoin payment that someone sent to me is valid, without relying on third parties? Or how can I make sure that this bitcoin is not doublespent, or that someone is trying to screw around with the network rules (create more bitcoin than the limit of 21mln) and so on?  
If I run my own full node, it does validate all these rules and incoming payments for me automatically, and protects me from malicious behavior of other network participants.

There is a FAQ on their site (doesn't answer all your questions though):   
I find it a highly interesting project. It makes paying with/buying/transacting bitcoin very very noob-friendly. Not getting access to your private key is the same as you don't get private keys on hardware wallets like Trezor.  
Although you don't get a seed here, either, as I understand, it's a trade off for convenience. I guess one of the usecases would be for people buying these notes and then transferring the balance on a wallet where they hold the private keys or simply paying with these notes themselves, or transacting with these notes.  
I think for lower amounts it's a very acceptable trade off for benefit of convenience. Obviously no one should keep their life savings on these.

re: 1) in very simple terms, high EC means high security for the network (an attacker would need a high % of the energy in order to be successful, and that % gets harder to achieve, if the EC is rising). It doesn't mean that EC will rise indefinitely, it will plateau at some point.

It's a bit of a polemic statement, but it's closer to the truth than "blockchain will save the world" paroles.

Not really. Running a BTC node serves mostly for your own good (verifying incoming transactions into your wallet). To be helpful to the Lightning Network (and earn some satoshis) you need to have channels with incoming capacity (meaning, someone has to open a channel to you, where the funds are on your partner's side).  
So it's fun and also useful to run a (LN) node, but mostly only for yourself. That's how it should be anyway, the network is not dependent on altruism :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:36:16
re-installing will get you to exactly the same point (or even an earlier one) as you are now (syncing to the network, which can take a lot of time). Either you let it sync completely, or I guess for your purposes you'd be better off getting another wallet, such as Samourai (android), Electrum or GreenAddress.  
Just to be sure... You bought/sent BTC, not BCH?
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:35:35
Sorry if I misunderstood.  
I think the point in short is that a fiat currency which continuously loses its value, is controlled by third parties and also lacks all the properties mentioned above is simply a worse store of value in the long run than bitcoin (it's not a guaranteed fact though, as bitcoin is still in its infancy). Fiat is of course a better SoV than, say, apples, which is obvious... But worse than other SoV assets.  
So as I understand your point: everything can be a store of value, including fiat, yes. I don't see the dichotomy though to bitcoin enthusiast's opinion that bitcoin is a better SoV?
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:32:37
It's not referring to a hard fork, but when there is two competing chain versions - resulting f.ex from two different miners finding a block simultaneously, and then part of the network building on one block, and part on another. This unintended "fork" is resolved by looking at which of these two chains for longer (=has more PoW behind it), and the shorter chain gets abandoned by the nodes/miners.  
It doesn't refer to a hardfork. F.ex, you can adjust the amount of possible existing bitcoins to 42mln and get 90% of the hashing power behind that change, and still it won't be bitcoin, except if the rest of the space (nodes) follow this change (=consensus).  
That's why sewgit2x didn't happen, although 90% of the miners were signaling for it
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:03:58
That's what usually happens with politicians, yes, but in this case the incentives (circumventing political/economical sanctions, getting free from the SWIFT payment network etc) seem quite big, so I am sure we will national states players making their moves to crypto in the coming years.

Gotcha.  
I do frequent some dev hangouts (though not a dev myself, only an enthusiast) and I absolutely agree that there are very smart people being reasonable and thinking through all kinds of adversarial scenarios in lightning, attack points, adoption issues etc, and how to prevent them.  
I was speaking more about the opinions I frequently encounter here on Reddit, Twitter, or comments section of various news articles, blog posts etc, where the opinions are far, far more polarized ("LN is the works or Blerkstream" vs "LN will save the world"). That's why I'm trying to remind newbies that it's something in the middle, although I am naturally more inclined to lean towards the latter ;)

That's how economists usually define currencies, but I just want to note that fiat monies are a terrible "store of value". Here f.ex the purchasing power of $100 USD in the last 100 years:   
The argument goes that the wages have risen, so they offset the losing purchase power, but this doesn't change anything on the terrible store of value aspect. If you store your savings in fiat, they will lose they purchasing power over time.

There have been plenty of articles on other sites, too, if you cared to type in "bitcoin cash hard fork what do i need to know" into google  
  


By now I assume you are either trolling or an unlucky moron with too much money on your hands. Also, the fork is a year ago now, why are you posting only today?  
Edit: maybe you're not trolling, and the person at IG was not acting in your best interest, but even in that case you're still a complete moron for not doing due diligence and research while having so much money on the table.

Since I am already synced, the initial sync wouldn't be a problem for me, for this particular node, at least. It would be a huge issue if I'd wanted to set up a new node from scratch though.  
But for the already running node I assume my shitty internet connection would be clogged and my node would be too slow with transaction validation, so it would become useless (too slow or just unable to validate all the transaction load in one 8mb+ block) and/or slow down my internet connection way too much.  
Honestly, I'm assuming things here that I don't actually know, but it's much better to err on the side of caution here, as we won't get another chance if we blow this one by being not cautious enough.
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:08:12
Well, it's a little more nuanced than that. And also it's not only about the doomsday scenario but also less "deadly" scenarios, like f.ex if vast amounts of hashpower would be shutdown overnight by government (if many miners are in the same geographical location) and then we'd have to wait two weeks for difficulty adjustment... In this period the tx processing might be slowed down considerably and the chain might be more prone to attacks and stuff like that.

Talking about journalistic integrity... The current, linked story on the reason why they destroyed their private key:  


While in the [original story]( from 2013, they argued:  


So they misjudged bitcoin's value, destroyed it as a publicity stunt (instead of giving it to a charity) because it's "nothing more than an abstraction", and now they tout it as a step to ensure their journalistic integrity.

The increased capacity will likely be an issue for me when/if the blocks become full again at some point. Segwit is a little different though: it fixed a transaction malleability issue, which would have made Lightning implementation much more difficult. And it was introduced as a soft fork, without creating a potential, contentious hard fork. Also, block size increase would have been necessary at some point, so given the advantages of SW, I am not complaining at the moment :)  
But increasing it further at this point seems too much, as long as other improvements and LN are not fully explored yet.

The space on bitcoin's blockchain is:  
- scarce  
- censorship resistant  
- immutable  
- very hard to confiscate  
- very easy to transport (send), without any borders and intermediaries  
- highly divisible, basically without limits  
At no point in human history has there been an asset combining all the mentioned properties into one. People don't really yet understand the value of owning a "piece" of such space, hence the price swinging so wildly.  
The "store of value" aspect is rather regarding these properties, than the price expressed in fiat, at least for me. I expect it to be even more valuable in the future, as more and more people begin to understand what kind of "thing" we deal with here, and as the code and the infrastructure develop further.  
As long as I run my own full node, I have sovereignty over the blockchain space that I own, which also is a thing that we never had before (the node ensures that no one can simply change the protocol rules and cheat me out of my coins).  
All those things make it a store of value for me.   
I don't see how this contradicts your definition of "assets that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time", btw?  
P.S: If you're up for a longer, but insightful read regarding the monetary/SoV properties of bitcoin, have a look here:

Market dominance is a completely useless metric, as it's based on market cap, which is in turn a completely useless metric in itself (you create 1bln coins, sell one of them for $1 to someone -&gt; booom you have 1bln market cap... that's how it's calculated)

Nope. I see many problems with BCH, magnified by the current flamewars, diviseveness and contention on the upcoming hard fork.*    
Besides, off-chain solutions are not the only thing that makes BTC much more valuable than BCH to me. On-chain protocol itself (code quality), as well as infrastructure, hash power, developer mindshare, blockchain size (who'll be able to run a node on BCH if the blocks are 32MB+?), adoption etc... I just can't see BCH competing in the same league in every regard.  
⁄* not that the contention is a bad/avoidable thing in itself (it's the same in BTC and every other anarchic, leaderless, decentralised system at scale)... But I don't see any favourable outcome/proposal from any party on BCH. I'm not too deep into that though, so time and markets will the best judges.

Not only build! Educate yourself, read, ask, discuss.. test stuff (plenty of small, open-source projects are out there)! Even if you are not tech-savy, you can test UI (user interface) and give feedback/ideas to devs, as we need every UI improvement we can get for broader adoption. The dev community is usually very helpful, open and friendly to newbies, despite how crypto space might look like judging by social media. 
 
If you have the basics down, try to help newbies out, write posts, answer questions... Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know something. **Every** expert in bitcoin is still learning and evolving. Be sceptical of anyone calling themselves an expert, anyway.  
Have a beginner's mindset. So much to learn here!

There's a loud, flashy meme culture around lambos, and "bitcoin to the moon" and whatnot. But to equate the whole bitcoin space with that is a similar mistake if you would mistake cars for "rich kids' toys" just because they are used as a wealth symbol in rap videos or something :)

Are you aware how much fees payment service providers like VISA take off from merchants?

Localbitcoins is kinda like ebay, it's just a platform where buyers and sellers can find each other and buy/sell bitcoin (without the price auction, fixed prices).  
You can make a wallet with Bitcoin Core, yes, but given you really want just to transfer bitcoin once, I'd go with a light wallet (Bitcoin Core is a full node wallet and takes a while to set up/synchronize). Something like Samourai, Electrum or GreenAddress (depending on your/your dad's phone/computer). 
So basically:  
1. you and your dad get bitcoin wallets installed (on phone or computer).  
2. your dad buys bitcoin (that's probably a tricky part in Iran).  
3. after he received bitcoin, he sends it over to your address.  
4. after you received it, you sell it for fiat (either localbitcoins, or exchange like Gemini, Coinbase or whatever else is available in Canada).  
That said, you really should learn a bit more how basic things work before you send your dad off to buy bitcoin. He can potentially lose money if he don't know what he's doing.  
Read the FAQ's here, or bitcoin.org or check out the resources on

Yes but cars is not a tech that (potentially) disrupts banks, payment systems, political entities in charge and the social system as a whole in the long run. That's why btc crowd is often somewhat politically charged and there is a lot of ideologies thrown in.
Agree on the rest of your post though. Good point regarding USA vs European left.

The important word here is *can* :)  
I'm as excited about LN as anyone, but it's an experimental software running on top of another experimental software and there are yet miles to go. Also, even if the software runs smoothly, it's still a question of adoption by actual users, which might take some time.  
Not to dampen the optimism, just a reminder to stay realistic :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:24:46
I'm assuming you mean a receiving address which looks something like one of those in the link:   
They can be re-used infinite amount of times (so you don't have to worry if two different people send you coins on the same address), but it is discouraged to use an address more than once, mostly due to privacy reasons. That's why almost all modern wallets will create a new receiving address after an incoming transaction has been received.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:55:13


Yes, the LN path-finding algorithm would automatically seek alternative routes, of which there should be plenty, as the network grows and branches out. Also, you always can manually disconnect from the malicious hub (if you are connected directly), or from its peers, and open new channels to non-malicious nodes.  
I haven't seen any in-depth discussions on that regard yet though. But as long as everyone can run their full node, the network can stay permissionless and censorship resistant. It's the same as in bitcoin, tbh. Not everyone will run a full node, obviously, but the fact that it's possible and the fact that many people do, acts as protection from censorship.

Well, if the perpetrator sits f.ex in Netherlands and gets sued by someone in the Netherlands, the US authorities don't get into play, but the perpetrator still gets in trouble. But also if f.ex an US citizen is involved, the US authorities might get involved. It depends a lot on jurisdictions/locations of the parties involved, so it's not that simple, but by no means is it a "law free zone", even if it's unregulated and global market. 
IANAL, so this might be all very wrong. Just my current understanding of things.
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:27:25
You have to differ between governance of bitcoin as protocol/software and governance of bitcoin *infrastructure* (exchanges, companies, service providers etc).  
The former is out of reach of any government or any other entity (bitcoin has been build to prevent control by any party). The latter is very much in hands of government, especially if there is fiat money involved (so specifically exchanges), and I would say that yes, it is unavoidable to have fiat on-ramps being regulated. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:38:07

I guess a have a different view on altcoins in general. In my opinion, I would never recommend a newbie to get into them without getting a solid grasp on bitcoin first.  
Instead of providing them with materials how to trade, I would rather put in more explanations, f.ex how to run a full node, what "bitcoin core" actually means, that you can earn bitcoin instead of buying it.. Or if you buy, that you could use ways not requiring KYC, such as localbitcoins or Bisq...  
Links to excellent resources compilation such as  and so on and so on.  
But anyway, kudos to you that you're open to feedback :)  
Perhaps, if you are adamant on leaving the trade section in, I would at least explicitly write that **trading is a certain way to lose money over the long-run** and one should rather buy&amp;hold, not trade frequently. But for buying&amp;holding I wouldn't recommend anything else than bitcoin, so we're back at the beginning :D

I am neither an economist nor a historian, but the articles/books I've read on that topic (Nick Szabo articles, as well as [The Bullish Case For Bitcoin]( and [The Bitcoin Standard]( suggest that an item first becomes a collectible (for its particular properties, usually such as scarcity, durability, fungibility, divisibility, transportability etc etc), then store of value, then medium of exchange and then unit of account.  
Obviously it's not a clear, linear progress, but an evolution nevertheless. An item doesn't become all three (SoV, medium of exchange, unit of account) over night and doesn't acquire these status at the same time.  
edit: maybe I missed your point a little, as you don't seem to argue agains the "gradual process" theory, but rather that we have to satisfy "means of exchange" point. I think it will arise quite naturally, as long as merchants are valuing bitcoin enough that they incentivize their customers to pay them in bitcoin. So if the "store of value" thing is fulfilled, the means of exchange will follow naturally, because bitcoin is well suited for that. Of course it's not yet perfect, but it evolves and there's a lot of development happening.

Bitcoin will still be mineable after all the coins are mined.. It's just that the miners won't receive any block rewards, only the fees from the transactions. Ideally, the fees in the future will compensate for lack of block rewards, but this is not guaranteed yet.  
Btw that's one of the reasons why increasing the blocksize is so contentious. If there is no fee market (people competing for "space" in the blocks), miners will struggle to earn money for their electricity/hardware consumption after all the bitcoins are mined.

That's a dangerous thought to follow. Satoshi didn't foresee the ASICs development as well as some bugs (one of which was critical, and if happened nowadays, it probably would mean a certain death or near death for bitcoin - it was solved by an emergency hard fork, which was possible as the system was just in its infancy at that time).

It's very far from being the "only one" solution. It's just the most prominent and exciting one. There are people and research/development projects working on very different things. F.ex, some are mentioned here:  (their "presentations" page is down, but you might find the videos on youtube). Also, projects like Schnorr and Mast, while not primarily presented as scaling solutions, do contribute to smaller tx size, which is scaling, too.

Don't panic though if it doesn't confirm longer. 10 minutes is an average between blocks (which contain the transactions), sometimes it takes only a few min, sometimes way more than ten minutes.  
Also it depends on the fees the sender attached to the transaction and how many transactions there are at the given moment...  
Don't worry, you don't necessarily need to understand all this stuff to accept bitcoin as payment, but just in case you run into some issues - don't panic, the transaction will be confirmed sooner or later :)

No. If I want to give you a specific sum of money, in a public place (like a cafe), while all the people are staring at us... And I want to do that in an envelope, instead of giving it you bill by bill... Is it money laundering or a simple desire for privacy?

Because many newbies are encouraged to trade crypto and when there is someone better than them in trading (which is basically everyone in the market), they are quick to scream "manipulation". Or when there are large buy/sell amounts.  
Curiously, no one seems to mind when the large orders are on the buy side, but on the way down it's always "manipulation".

Yes, the vast majority of people in western (first world) countries with stable currencies don't understand what it means to have a wildly inflationary/unstable monetary system, vulnerable to whims of a handful politicians.  
If you have access to the modern banking system, in a major currency, the usecase for bitcoin doesn't look at all obvious. You have fast, even instant payments, your transaction likely won't get censored (don't you dare make a donation to WikiLeaks though, citizen) and everything is dandy.  
That's a minority of people in today's world though... Most of the population doesn't have this privilege, and they don't hang out on Reddit/Twitter either, complaining about how bitcoin is not user friendly.

Sure, probably better to stick to projects that are somewhat known in the space. If they open sourced, it's unlikely that they can get away with hiding malicious code. But for a beginner it's of course impossible to see, so it's better to install software that has gained some reputation already.  
Also, there are projects that don't require work with actual software at all. F.ex, translation of/contribution to infographics, like this one here:   
But yes, being careful and mindful what software you are installing is always a very good idea, especially dealing with cryptocurrencies :)

Get a hardware wallet.  
Make sure you backed it up properly. Send a small transaction first. Wipe the device. Re-install it with the backup.

You might be over-interpreting my posts.  
I'm neither suggesting that bitcoin/LN is a failed experiment, nor that we shouldn't continue to work on it. On the contrary!

Absolutely agree. I'd like to point out though that the development in crypto is like the evolution of internet on speed (and the development of internet was something like industrial revolution on speed). We have such enormous synergy effects through the interconnectedness of the space, and due to its open-sourced, permissionless nature, that the steps we are making are simply giant.  
One month in crypto space feels like ten months outside of it, and it's not only because of the price, news, regulations etc etc, but also because of the constant development work on all layers.

Transcendence. It's the holy spirit manifested in binary, prayed to by thousands of nodes and made tributes to in form of electricity every ten minutes. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:12:12


Yes, keeping the "potential pool", as you say, as wide and as easy accessible as possible is crucial here. Because if you find yourself censored in any way, (if your only connection is a third party node) you should be able to jump into that pool as easily as possible and set up your own node, with little cost and effort.  
If that possibility is there, big hubs won't have as much (or any) power. It's exactly the same as with the bitcoin protocol itself. No one can censor you, or stop your transaction, if you run your own full node. If you cannot run your full node, you gotta trust some other full node, which then has a certain degree of power over your transactions.

Yes, the miner who finds a block gets the block rewards of 12.5 btc plus all the fees included in the block.  
"Finding" is a bit misleading here btw... the miner has to guess the solution to some sort of a cryptographic puzzle, and if this solution is correct, the miner gets to attach a new block to the existing blockchain

I appreciate your input, and although I haven't studied economics in depth, I'd like to continue the conversation in order to learn more for myself. So I'm open to changing my mind or at least to understand your point better.  


So what's the timeframe in which money is supposed to be a good store of value?  


Why will inflation always exist?  
Also, isn't the notion that "it's good" based on economic theories, which in turn are just that.. theories? Austrian economics f.ex see things differently.  


I'm aware of that... after I've spent months learning about investing, what to invest in, how to avoid being basically scammed by brokerage fees, taxes etc... Also, I know what variance is (on markets). These are things that I taught myself. Nobody in school or university didn't even mention that I need to look into that. How many average people know how to take care of their savings? From my experience, it's the minority.  
Also, what about people who are not in the USD or EUR or other stable currency economies? Again, majority of people aren't... They get slaughtered by clueless/greedy governments, partially through inflation.

@_date: 2018-05-06 17:16:07
Yep. Try to sync a full, indexed node on a weaker/older device or with a shitty internet connection. If we don't keep hardware requirements as low as we can (and it's not only bandwidth, validation/CPU and storage can be an issue, too!), we risk that less people would be able to run their own full nodes and would have to rely on third party nodes. This takes away the power from people who have to trust nodes of others and gambles away the decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant aspect of the whole system.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:38:11
In a way, it is necessary. Every little vulnerability in bitcoin (be it in code, infrastructure, or the community) will be attempted to exploit, because there is so much money on the line (and there will be much, much more in the future). So we are seeing these powergrabs and games, forks, attacks and whatnot. So it's better to get the space hardened now than later.

I'd say it's the other way around. Gold is easier to confiscate and harder to store safely (although crypto needs some amount of research to be stored safely). Also, you can't take all your gold as easily when you move to another location, especially cross international borders. You also can't send gold to someone else over the internet.  
And you can't turn gold to fiat from your own home in matter of minutes, as you can do with bitcoin.

As I said, I am following that development, which includes  :) and iirc he never mentioned LN before in this context.  
Layer 2 is a general description, it's not only lightning. It might be, but doesn't have to. They could be working on an own L2 solution. Or integrate it on a whole different coin (as you pointed out, btc is not even the single candidate here, although it's the most likely, I agree)
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:40:47

2) no, at the moment there are the regular on-chain wallets and (pre)beta lightning wallets (like Eclair, Zap, LND wallet etc). No "regular" wallet has implemented lightning yet.

Maybe, but this kinda implies something like "if you don't jump on it right now, it'll be too late to participate in two years", which means FOMO and exclusion. BTC is not an elitist club.  
Rising complexity of the underlying tech doesn't mean the front end is getting harder to use (see phones).  
But ok, if you pitch it to some tech people and want to emphasize the fact that they should try and learn about BTC as much/as soon as possible, this might make sense, I guess. Depends on your audience and the focus of your talk perhaps.

I'm not deep into TOR and anonymity measures, but my understanding is that you can disconnect your phone, create a new address/wallet, choose the TOR option, and only then connect your phone back again...  And even if you create a wallet while being connected to the internet, the wallet doesn't send any data while creating the wallet, as I understand?

It's fully up to you how you value the privacy aspect. You are free to completely ignore it, but keep in mind that transactions on the blockchain stay there forever, in public... so a person/organisation knowing your identity and the correlated BTC address can see all the incoming and outgoing transactions on this address and can link them to your identity. It also can somewhat analyse other BTC addresses linked to you to some extent.  
This is one of the reasons why privacy is valued by so many people and why it's frequently recommended not to re-use bitcoin addresses.  
Also, the more people give up their privacy, the more difficult it becomes for other participants to stay anonymous (universally speaking, not only in bitcoin).  
To boil this down to a very simple analogy: 
 ? + ? = 5 
 3 + ? = 5  
the first example symbolises a population where everyone (or most participants) keep their anonymity, the second one is where most participants are not anonymous, which makes anonymity for other participants impossible. Again, very simplified, but hopefully you get the point :)

The warrant doesn't say anything why he's being raided. Only what to look for. Could have been a crime where a BTC payment was involved (like, extortion attempt where he demanded the ransom to be paid in BTC).  
Saying that he was raided "for cashing out bitcoin investment" is simply false without further information.  
Edit: mods, maybe a "misleading" flair in the title would be appropriate here

Decentralisation won't make anything more efficient, at least not directly. Bitcoin's blockchain is actually very ineffiecient and slow, compared to systems based on trust/authority (which in turn are not censorship resistant, immutable, borderless etc). There are always trade-offs.

Good points. I share your concerns (although I'm optimistic about the future). Bitcoin definitely needs as much UX/UI improvements as it can get, because at the moment it's more like something constructed by engineers for engineers (from the point of view of an avg, non-technical person).

Right or wrong about what exactly? There's a lot of speculation in the article, I'm not sure what you referring to specifically.  
As a rule of thumb: "dooming situations" in mainstream media regarding bitcoin are always wrong, because they're based on misunderstandings of the tech or incorrect assumptions.

It's a parody - a coin from a series called Silicon Valley. The creators show a surprising depth of insight into the current crypto space, so that got pretty viral lately. The short video clips I've come across are hilarious, too.  
So no harm done here :)  
edit: it looks like that might be an actual coin, trying to use the show. See Charlie Lee's tweet: 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:29:32
The idea is that you have more funds in your channel than just for one single purchase. You can then use these funds to send payments to other participants/merchants. So if you are already connected to Bitrefill, but want to send money to company Y, you can do so through your existing channel (the payment will be routed to that merchant indirectly, you won't need to open another channel).  
In the future, it will also be possible to top up the channel. But we're not there yet.  
So yes, if all you want to do is make one single payment to Bitrefill, you are better off with an on-chain payment. But if you want to use Lightning in the near future again (be it for Bitrefill, or other merchants/peers), you could open and fund a channel and use it whenever you like.  
Btw, 16 sats sounds quite a lot for a Lightning payment, actually. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:50:58
The truth is in the second one. The first one is just used for convenience, because people are used to the understanding, that you *store* money in your *wallet*. It's just a bad analogy that spread out and now too late to change.  
A wallet is a piece of software that stores your private/public keys and these keys are used for moving your coins. The coins are "stored" and transacted on the blockchain.  
Hope this makes it a little more clear :) Don't hesitate to ask again, if not. It can sound a bit confusing at the beginning.

Definition of money laundering by Wikipedia: "Money laundering is the act of concealing the transformation of profits from illegal activities and corruption into ostensibly "legitimate" assets."  
I don't see how that fits here. "Hiding origins" does not necessarily equals "transformation of profits from illegal activities". I can have other reasons for not wanting the public see my transactions, the most basic one is that it's just not anyone's business :) 
 
Obviously, you can use JoinMarket for money laundering purposes, in a similar manner as you can use a bank transaction for the such purposes. It doesn't make the bank (or JoinMarket) a money laundering service. Similar as encryption doesn't make communication apps "tools for criminal coordination".

A privately pre-sold token, which presumably will be traded on exchanges in the future, is a very different thing from publicly accepting (non-tokenized) investment funds from accredited investors, imo.  
The biggest difference is that with the former one you can pump and dump, while the latter is more likely to serve as development backing. That's why the ICO route has been such a shitshow so far, and I'm really happy Lightning Labs didn't follow it.  
Edit: just to be clear, not "Lightning" (the protocol) raised money... But Lightning Labs, which is a company behind **one** of three Lightning protocol implementations (the others two being c-lightning and Eclair).

The power that my raspberry has is to independently  verify (my) transactions. Without it, I am powerless and have to rely on third parties to tell me if my transaction is valid or not.  
Obviously, if my node drops off the network, the network won't care (and that's good), but for my own sovereignty on the bitcoin network, it's obligatory that it stays on (at least so that it is synced quickly when I need to make/receive a tx)

Well f.ex., if you can contact your channel partner, who now has the half of your channel balance after your payment, you could convince him/her to send that balance back to you, for a service or an on-chain payment or whatever.  
It's just an idea, not how it's supposed to work, but as long as the software is barely in the beta phase, it's an option... But honestly, it's easier to just open a new channel :)

But, if it's a question which has been asked thousand times already, or one that is formulated very broadly, it's unlikely to receive high quality answers.

yeah, this is not going to happen :) and if it does, I'd consider bitcoin a failure. Not because I want "illegal transfers" to succeed, but because if bitcoin loses privacy (it's not very private right now anyway), or will be controlled/surveilled by third parties, there will be an outflow of developers and users, which made this grassroot, open-source project possible in the first place. And then it will be Paypal 2.0, which no one really needs right now.

Yes of course. Many people involved in bitcoin development belong to the top of their expertise area and are used to think over adversarial scenarios... That's why bitcoin has withstood the test of time and attacks so far :)

Unfortunately, I wouldn't. My node took a long time to sync with the network, and it will probably drop off the network if the blocksize is increased that drastically (and if the tx amount within these blocks increases). I suspect many other nodes will do so as well.

The principle itself is somewhat easy to understand, but also difficult to grasp in its technical details :) Perhaps this will clarify things further: [Understanding Lightning Network using an Abacus](  


In this particular scenario, the buyer's wallet is connected to the wallet's (Eclair) node. The seller has either his own node or his wallet uses a specified node. Those two nodes are either connected directly, or indirectly through other nodes. If they are connected indirectly, the payment from the buyer to the seller gets routed through other nodes.

I absolutely agree on most of your post, except this part here. I'd also would wish for a quick adoption and implementation of user-friendly features, UX and so on, but I disagree that everyone has to panic and introduce that in a way that endangers the fundamental features of security, scrupulous peer- and code-review, testing etc etc. There's nothing to be gained from heating up this narrative of "quick, we gotta do something, or else...!".  
If you want progress to happen quicker, the only reasonable thing is to contribute in a way that makes sense for you, according to your skills and capabilities. If you don't have them yet, learn and evolve, and teach others how you did that :)

I don't have specific links at hand, sorry. It also depends at your location, there might be merchants accepting bitcoin locally, which don't have a site up (or which I don't know how to find through google).  
The adoption is not very far reaching yet though, to be honest. But there is no technical reason that bitcoin cannot be used for "necessity goods". Just as phone were once a status symbol of the rich, they became ubiquitous and a daily tool for everyone, getting easier to use and cheaper over time.

Well, I personally think that people who don't know how to trade in the first place, shouldn't be encouraged to trade bitcoin (which your app promotes basically). Instead, they should be educated about BTC, or at least learn how to buy and hold, and not trade (the vast majority of people *will* lose money with trading, be it in bitcoin or stock market).  
Besides, demo trading is same as demo poker: it only provides a wrong sense of security that you learned something. When you actually have skin in the game and there's money on the line, the game changes completely (as well as your emotions, which can screw up your decisions).  
Just my two cents. But I assume those are mostly the reasons why people downvote you here.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:49:26
Not a dev, but I probably would suggest looking into the current Lightning Network development, as it is the most promising development in bitcoin, imho. Check out there LND GitHub/slack, f.ex. There are other worthwhile projects though, like BTCpay server (open source, free payment processor) and others. Can't provide links atm, but all easily findable :)  
edit:  
[LND github]( (you'll find the Slack link there as well, it's pretty populated with devs/users)  
[BTCPay server github]( (Nicolas Dorier and the other devs are very responsive on Twitter and also here)

Well, it's a permissionless space, so if banks wanna participate, they have exactly the same rights as a farmer from Kenya (regarding bitcoin itself... not talking about regulations and "offline laws"). Also there will be people who are happy about banks doing that, because they can make tons of money.  
Also some people like that as a symbol of broader adoption. Then you have many OG cypherpunk bitcoiners who hate that. Then you have bitcoiners who don't care at all.  
"Bitcoiners" is not a homogenous bunch, deal with it :)  
Edit: I need to correct myself... OG bitcoiners mostly don't really care for banks getting into BTC (my perception... Cannot speak for them obv)... For everyone involved early in the day who was convinced about the tech, it was clear that banks and institutional players would get in at some point. And bitcoin was designed specifically with the property in mind that it couldn't be governed by powerful entities.

The progress is definitely astounding. "Experimental" is a question of definition as well: for me bitcoin is also experimental, even though it seems to be withstanding the test of time and different attacks/issues so far.  
But apart from the software, which is in continuous development, the "experimental" part is also regarding adoption and the implications for the society as a whole. We are simply going paths which haven't been explored previously, hence "experimental".

Spread meaning, compared to western exchanges? If so, it's nothing unusual to have huge spreads in markets where it's difficult to get fiat in/out, f.ex with tight capital controls...

Please don't confuse bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin is a protocol and a currency, while blockchain is one of the few technologies implemented by that protocol (besides Proof of Work and cryptography).  
Also, there are some questions which equal bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, f.ex if I see a future for bitcoin and other cryptos. While I would strongly agree on that for bitcoin, I am uncertain about other cryptos, so the question is a bit too broad :)

Your understanding seems generally correct.  
Your coins are the safest on an offline device (such as a hardware wallet). On the other hand, your own node is a guarantee that no one can trick you into receiving some invalid transactions.  
Quoting u/luke-jr (a bitcoin core dev):  


The best option is obviously to use both in combination with each other.  
To use both (your hardware wallet in combination with your own full node) perhaps this is helpful (unfortunately, it requires a bit of effort to set up):

Because I really don't want to flash my bank details to a random person every time I make a trade. Not only for privacy matters, but also if they get investigated for whatever reason (not even bitcoin related, could be taxes, criminal activities, whatever), and they have a link to my bank account due to a transaction, I am potentially in the focus of investigators, too.

Market dominance is a meaningless metric (more coins = less dominance for each of them, including bitcoin). Besides, isn't it based on market cap? Which is even more meaningless :)  
If I create 100.000 Muffincoins, and then sell just one of them for $100, boom - $1.000.0000 (100.000 x 100) marketcap! That's how that metric works basically :)
Also, "less miners"? The hashrate is close to an all time high and has been rising very steadily for many years now!

At the moment, it's still possible to pay an invoice twice (or more), I think. They do expire though (not sure what the default expiry time is - 15 or 30 min?).  
Also it's not yet possible to send payments without an invoice as far as I'm aware. This probably will change in the future, but not yet. You can open a channel though where you push the funds to your channel partner at the moment of creation.  
That was my info some weeks ago, but things move very fast, so perhaps that already changed.

Note that "bitcoin core" is the name of an implementation/software while "bitcoin cash" is a currency/coin. Their reference implementation is called bitcoin ABC.  
So either compare bitcoin core with bitcoin abc (or other software clients), or bitcoin with bitcoin cash. Otherwise it's apples and oranges.

A successful double-spent attempt would have a victim, who is scammed out of goods/services/funds this way. We would certainly have heard of someone who got defrauded with such an attack. Hence the absence of proof is actually proof of absence in this case, I'd say.  
Edit: just to prevent a common misunderstanding: miner pools consist of independent miners/entities, which are free to join/leave any time they like, so for a successful attack they all would need to cooperate. It's not just like three homogenous entities having &gt;51% hashing power.

That's basically it, yes.  


No, that is not what's happening. There is no need for more security with a rising price. If there's a correlation, then it's because with a rising price it becomes more profitable to mine bitcoin, so it's more likely that new miners might come online. But then again your first point kicks in (difficulty adjustment).  
Hashrate follows price, essentially.

Look at how misleading those online banks like Revolut or Robinhood (not a bank, investment app rather) are. They say you can bitcoin with them, but all you get is a number pegged to the bitcoin price. You never get control of your private keys, and cannot even withdraw bitcoin from there.

I would try to extract the seed phrase from the bitcoin core wallet and then import this phrase in one of the wallets I mentioned earlier (they won't need to sync as long as the bitcoin core wallet), and your transaction should be confirmed by then.  
The tricky part is that I am not familiar with extracting the seed phrase from bitcoin core, so you have to google yourself or perhaps someone else will chime in.  
Which OS are you running it on, btw?

My main objective was to bring in some caution into treating LN as the one and only guaranteed solution for all the issues bitcoin has, because I frequently see people being overly optimistic and taking the success as guaranteed, while it's not.  
Again, this is not a suggestion to stop being optimistic altogether, or stop developing.. I myself do whatever I can to contribute to the eco system in a meaningful way, so I'm not trying to stir up some unreasonable concerns here :)

I think the "ossification" thing means not that the software cannot be changed at all (nobody can guarantee that there aren't bugs present currently), or things cannot be changed as response to attacks, or proven efficiency improvements cannot be introduced etc, but rather that it'll become more and more difficult to introduce contentious/risky changes.

I went to the "announcements" part on the linked page and there was an announcement on "Lightning Bitcoin", which was very confusing. The link in this announcement led to a Medium article about "importing LTBC (Lightning Bitcoin from Bitpie to LBTC official wallet", which didn't have to do anything with Lightning Network at all.    
There were no other information on Lightning Network (the "real" one) on your linked page, so this seemed confusing at best and misleading/shady at worst. That was the reason for my comment.  
  
If I was hasty with that conclusion, I'm sorry, but I hope you understand that it looked suspicious.

Set up a wallet, **make a back up of your seed phrase**, send a tiny amount to it (like, $5 worth or something), delete the wallet. Set it up again with your seed phrase. If you were successful, you can be more confident that you understood how it works and not screw up your back up in case you need it. You have to understand the crucial point what the seed phrase does and how important it is to store it properly.  
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:12:16
Breadwallet is legit, too, although I am not familiar with it and it might be that it syncs to the chain (which takes a while) before it's usable. Generally, that's a good thing, but for one-off payment perhaps unnecessary. Anyway, should be a good choice.  
**Always make sure you are downloading from the right source** (check play store reviews etc), plenty of scams around

If you read "bestselling books" on bitcoin I probably would wager that those were some crap ;)  
I'm not sure what exactly to recommend, as I am not sure what exactly is the issue, but perhaps just get something like a $10 worth of bitcoin, set up a wallet, write down the seed words, make a transaction, delete the wallet and import the back up seed again (perhaps in another wallet) and things like that, just to understand how the basics work...

That's incorrect. You don't need a connection at all to create a private key (neither the "bitcoin ledger" need to know of the key at the moment of the key's creation, nor vice versa). You need a source of randomness (like a pair of dice, f.ex) and an understanding of how to use this source to create a private key. No connection required (in fact, no connection is much better for security).

This might be a dumb question, but do you think that what you've described might be a symptom of "protocol ossification" (things becoming harder to change)? Although from what I observe, "ossification" seems to mean something desirable (by the people who are talking about it), while your description sounds rather disheartening.  
Do you see developers getting frustrated with the mentioned issues is a danger to the protocol development that should be addressed at some level?

Maybe the channels are still pending? Afaik they need 3 (or was it six?) confirmations to be listed as "active". And even with sufficient confirmations they might still get "inactive", f.ex if the channel partner node went offline or something (which is unlikely if you have multiple channels, but not impossible).  
In any case, what does `lncli listchannels` show? And what does `lncli pendingchannels` show? You should be able to see all active and inactive/pending channels with those two commands. If no channels are visible with either of those two, something else is going on.

You need to put in some effort to understand what private keys do on a very basic level (you don't need to understand the cryptography stuff) and why you need to take great care of them. There is no super easy answer, as it depends on your funds (if you only have like a $20 worth of bitcoin, you'll probably be fine with a smartphone wallet.. but for $2000 you better buy a hardware wallet), and your level of knowledge (higher security above customer grade average requires higher complexity and there are more ways to screw it up).

Before payment: node3 has $40 on their side, node4 has $0.  
After payment: node3 has $0, node4 has $40.  
This means, node3 cannot send anymore to node4 (but node4 can send back to node3).

To make one thing clear: there are no monetary benefits to run a lightning node yet, and probably won't be for the near future.  
But, there are others:  
- you don't rely on any third party to verify your fund and process your transactions  
- you'll learn **a lot** about how bitcoin and LN work  
- you increase the networks liquidity and throughout capacities (you have to do it "right" though, it requires a bit of effort to maintain channels etc) 
- you'll have a fully validating bitcoin node (LN nodes run on top of bitcoin nodes), which means you don't leak privacy to third parties (your wallet provider), and you can independently verify your incoming transactions  
Risks:  
- privacy leaks, if you run without tor (your IP is broadcasted in the LN node uri)  
- still early phase, monetary loss possible due to inexperience or user screw ups

Coinbase is not a wallet, it's an exchange (like a stock exchange/broker). You can send the bitcoin there, but you'd give them control over your bitcoin. I would recommend setting a wallet on your phone or pc (free and open source), or getting a so called hardware wallet ( they cost a bit, but are much more secure).

edit: as u/N0tMyRealAcct pointed out, AMP won't help in this particular scenario, I got OP's example wrong. AMP would only work if there'd be more than one path from the source to the destination (as the name "Atomic **Multi-path** Payment" implies). In OP's scenario, there is only one possible path, hence AMP won't help here.   
Unfortunately, OP's idea won't work either, as sending a $40 payment through the channel of node3/node4 would bring the channel out of balance and any further payment in the same direction would not go through. Think of it as a string of beads on an abacus: if you push the whole string from one side to the other, you can't push anymore beads in the same direction. You either need to move the beads back first, or you need to use a string on another wire.

If you managed to download the bitcoin core software and get it to run, you'll also manage to copy the blockchain to another node, no worries ;)

Great initiative!  
Some quick thoughts:  
- Instead of downloading a pdf file, perhaps it could be solved differently (linking to a html site, advice to print it/save as pdf)? Because we're always telling people not to download anything suspicious and when the very first step on an unknown site involves download of a file, this might raise some alarm bells (and rightfully so)  
- Step 7 should imo explain why **use** a full node with your wallet and ideally, how to connect your (hardware) wallet to your own node (perhaps the linked video does this though, I haven't watched it yet). This is tricky, as it involves additional software like EPS, Electrs and so on, but at least the user should be made aware of that simply spinning up a node does not do anything as long as it is not **used** with a wallet.

u/bitusher's list ist great. Educating yourself is one of the most important aspects in my opinion as well. There are many good sources, some of them are:  and     
As other's said, running a node is also good. Contrary to popular opinion, it doesn't "support the network" though. The purpose of a node is to verify your transactions. If your wallet is not connected to your own node, it doesn't do anything.  
That said, you might want to run one either way, as it's a good way to learn and who knows, perhaps you'll need one sooner than you think :)   
You also can play around with different open source apps that are out there and help the developers testing it, reporting bugs, asking for features that you miss etc. Perhaps even look into the code itself, if this is something that interests you (code review is always badly needed).  
Most importantly, enjoy yourself and never stop learning :)

The tx has the lowest possible fee (1sat/byte) and there was a huge influx of low fee transactions in the last two days:

This has not to do anything with concept of bitcoin.  
If a situation in your country makes it difficult to import cars or to sell them and foreign cars sell at a 15% premium as compared to other countries, it doesn't have anything to do with the concept of a car.

Mostly you benefit from your own node when you are receiving transactions (so you can validate them on your own without trusting and leaking privacy to random nodes/blockexplorers). Theoretically, you'd need to start your node only when you are about to look up if your transaction is confirmed. But your node needs to catch up with the blockchain and if you've been offline for a long while, it might take some time to catch up.  
So it's beneficial to not let it fall out of sync for too long of a time, but it doesn't have to be online 24/7. On the other hand, if you have a separate device for it to run on (like a raspberry pi or a separate laptop), it's kinda convenient as it is ready to use at all times and it isn't super draining on bandwidth (and you can tweak it a bit, if you think it drains too much bandwidth).

I think after 9 years you would want to update your storage method, even if you're the strongest holder.

You don't need to trust anyone with your money (the channel partner cannot steal anything). The only "trust" you have to put into is that the channel partner doesn't close channels to you in an unfortunate moment, but as a merchant you probably shouldn't rely on only one single channel anyway.

Bitcoin hasn't become something. The perceptions and narratives around it change. And sure, there are some religious tones in parts of the community. It doesn't prevent other people from seeing it as an "investment option", and other people from seeing it as a technical playground. And other as tool to help themselves from oppressive regimes or careless financial politics. Or a "tulip mania". Or a savings account. Or a mixture of all those above.  
You see bitcoin through your very own perception lenses (this goes for the whole world of course). Doesn't mean that others will share your lenses :)

Disclaimer: I am not a coder myself and am not able to verify the claims made in the video.  
Also, as Shinobi points out in the beginning of his rant, he does not accuse the Blue Wallet team of maliciousness, but rather of incompetence. So my intention posting this is not to pile on the Blue Wallet devs, but to push for awareness with the existing issues (in the hopes that they will be fixed quickly), as I see this wallet being recommended a lot recently, especially to beginners, and I don’t want people to lose their money.    
Issues being addressed in the video:  
- “double-spend” problem is not being fixed properly
- possibility to generate multiple addresses (invoices), of which only one of them actually updates your balance (meaning, if other invoices are paid, the money doesn’t arrive on your balance)  
- screwing up fees estimation (users reporting paying 40000 sat!) and taking fees (which are not advertised anywhere) for their custodial services  
Keep in mind, apart from all that Blue Wallet by default is a **custodial wallet**, which means you have to trust them with your money and you cannot verify on your own that your funds and your transactions are legit and correct (although it is possible to connect the wallet to your own node in order to verify).

Increasing the block size without consensus just creates a split/hard fork. Satoshi would have needed to increase the block size when he was the lone developer of the project, if that was what he really would have wanted. After the project got sufficient traction, it is up to its users to decide how to proceed with consensus critical changes. But basically: no consensus = no changes (for backwards incompatible rule changes).  
So answering the question again: I think Satoshi would consider "bitcoin" to be the chain that is the backwards compatible continuation of the chain from the time when he was around. But apart from the hypothetical pondering, it doesn't really matter what Satoshi would consider anymore. Bitcoin is what its users want it to be.

There's not really a winner. Both have slightly different purposes (beyond basic functions which are mostly the same).  
Biggest difference is of course the coinjoin feature, which Electrum lacks. But Electrum has more advanced features in other regards: multisig wallet support, message signing, and some more advanced (but also niche, I guess) stuff.  
I would say if you never plan to use coinjoin, you should go with Electrum. You also can download Wasabi and use Wasabi at some later point, it's not like you can't use both ;)  


The "fee" is not $900. The fees are miniscule. But yeah, there's a minimum amount for coinjoins: 0.1 btc.

I think that there will be other solutions down the road. Maybe not next year, but in two years, five years, ten years, who knows what people will come up with.  
Even without further solutions, there will be efficiency improvements on the basis protocol level (such as Schnorr etc).  
But I think that even without those bitcoin won't fail. It won't reach mass adoption for buying coffees perhaps, but it will serve other purposes, even if it will be more expensive to transact.

The "structure" goes like this (simplified): seed -&gt; private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address.  
So when you create a new wallet, you create a new private key. From this private key, the wallet can generate public key(s), and from those it generates addresses (this happens automatically, you don't need to worry about that). An address is something that you give to somebody (in your example, to Coinbase) so they can send you coins.  
So in order to receive coins from Coinbase (or from anyone else), you need to install a wallet, then follow the instructions closely (**write down the seed phrase and store it offline!**), then generate an address and put this address into the withdrawal menu on Coinbase.  
Does this help?

Is it more secure to leave a bunch of money in a badly secured locker on a train station, or to give it to some guy who promises to keep it safe? The answer is: it depends. Both are pretty shitty, but depending on your circumstances one might be better than other.  
That said, why not a hardware wallet? Continuing my analogy above, this would be like a safe in your own home.

I'm pretty sure that for the value of transaction you would do with an unknown person face-to-face, one confirmation should be enough ;)

"Unused" means that it's maintainer (OP) doesn't connect his wallet to it. Which seems true to me from the way he phrased his questions and communicated within this thread :)  
Unused public nodes do not contribute anything to the networks security. If you have your own node but continue to run your wallet over someone else's node, you still have all the same risks and privacy leaks that are connected to using third party nodes.

No, you shouldn't trade at all. As a trader, you are competing at a disadvantage again professional traders, bots, institutions, volatility and your own emotions. Why would you think you can beat the market? What is your edge there?    
Imagine you would go to a professional chess competition and play for money. If this is something that brings you fun, you should go for it, but you will lose money long-term.  
I would advise to learn about bitcoin, not about trading. You might start here ("Getting Started"):

Your transaction has already 89 confirmations. Your wallet is probably not syncing for some reason and shows wrong (old) data.

Generating your own seed is strongly discouraged, as humans are inherently bad at generating randomness (which is crucial here). Humans are also pretty bad at handling raw private keys.  
If you are absolutely sure what you are doing and can do it without an online machine, you might want to go ahead and try it, but chances are you aren't.  
I think it's pretty irresponsible of bitcoin.org to suggest that to users without disclaimers and further infos.  
You can take a look here to at least get some first insight what the creation of a random seed involves: 
@_date: 2019-11-23 09:17:13
I am all for making/keeping bitcoin accessible and user friendly and for educating people who are curious. But I don't really care about "the mass" or pushing mass adoption (whatever this actually means). I don't think "the mass" is ready for bitcoin, nor is bitcoin ready for "the mass". Personally, I'd rather focus on people who are genuinely curious by themselves and want to dive deeper.

I personally think such companies will pursue a custodial, centralized 2nd layer solution instead of lightning. Then they can control the pace of development, control the payment flow, promotional side of things, can advertise with safety, speed and whatnot... And especially they can make payments reversible, refundable and restorable (in case of loss etc).  
Basically, fiat but on top of bitcoin, where they can settle on to in the end of the day/week or whatever. This would make more sense for a large business at this point in time, I think, and most of their customers probably wouldn't care if it's centralized, as long as everything is running smooth and has a nice UX.

There is no (risk-free) prediction of such things. Your reasonable options are:  
- just bear the risk  
- minimize the risk (sell those amounts of bitcoin that you cannot stomach going down in value)  
- hedge the risk (by shorting an appropriate amount of bitcoin) -&gt; this is more advanced/complicated option where you possibly can fuck a lot of things up and most likely it's not worth it in your case

Not the most sophisticated model, but if you both could agree on the probability of bitcoin being &gt;10k on 31st Dec, you could split your money according to that probability?  
F.ex, if you both agree that it's ~80% certain that the price won't be above 10k on that date, you split the money 80/20.  
I don't think there is an objectively fair value you could arrive at, as everything depends on what your assumptions on future price will be, so every solution requires some subjectivity and/or room for compromise.  
edit: it also depends on how badly one of the parties wants to end the bet and how friendly you both are with each other :D

My only guess for now would be that the site that you created your private keys with was either not trustworthy, or perhaps their algorithm is flawed?  
Why would you be so careful to not trust hardware wallet creators (it doesn't matter if they go out of business, you can restore your seed on any other wallet), but instead you trust a random website without any credentials whatsoever to create a wallet for you?  
In any case, sorry for your loss :/

A node's primary purpose is to serve you for transactions verification (so you don't have to trust third parties) and for preserving your privacy (so you don't leak information to said third parties). Simply adding an unused node doesn't really help the network. But of course you should do it if you feel like it, and you'll have a ready node if perhaps at some later point you want to connect your (hardware) wallet to it.  
Ok, so your whole internet connection is running through an USB stick? What happens when you go here  and check port 8333? Not really sure what recommend for USB stick connections otherwise, unfortunately...

The issue is that they depicted it as they already had network consensus, or at least that it was likely (while it was more than unlikely), claiming the hashpower on their side and telling users that they were in danger if they wouldn't update their nodes to SW2X fork. F.ex:  


  
I find this very misleading and deceptive. Miners **didn't adopt Segwit2x** and your node wasn't on a "dysfunctional minority chain" if you didn't update to SW2x software (which itself turned out to be buggy and [dysfunctional]( btw).  
I remember also various similar claims on the SW2X mailinglist but don't have sources to back this up.  
There are some write ups that also explain the situation at that time:  
  
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:23:52


No. You can think of it like this: which of the current bitcoin chains is still compatible with the first original clients that came out when Satoshi was still around? Which chain would Satoshi's software sync to, if he were to spin up an old node (there need to be some minor tinkering with the software though, tbh)?   
To make it short: all the changes that happened on the bitcoin chain are *backwards compatible**. All forks of bitcoin have made some changes in their software that removed this backwards compatibility (bigger blocks or other incompatible changes).  
\* technically incorrect, since there were events in the past that you could count as a hardfork (due to a critical bug). You can find an overview here:   


Yes, correct.  


I guess the chain that is still backwards compatible to the chain that he launched?

You don't have any vote.  
Your node is supposed to let you verify your own (incoming) transactions without trusting any third party (miners, blockexplorers, your wallet's default nodes etc). It also gives you an additional layer of privacy. But you need to connect your wallet to the node in order to achieve that.  
So I guess you have some kind of a "vote" in a very abstract sense, but not in any direct one.  
On your actual question:  keeps you up-to-date with major releases and news. For more detailed information you could follow the Bitcoin Core GitHub:  but this is more technical stuff.  
edit: I'd also add that you might want to consider running your node through Tor to be a good owner :)

Short: it validates your bitcoin transactions for you so you don't have trust anyone else (your wallet's nodes, blockexplorer, the person who send you bitcoin etc). It also ensures a higher level of privacy, because you don't leak information about your transactions to third parties.

It will be the case much sooner than that, &gt;80% of all btc is already mined and block rewards in ~12 years will already be miniscule
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:07:35
Usually this kind of premium has to do with higher operational costs for traders (because of capital flow restrictions mostly, banking issues, high demand and low supply etc). If it wasn't the case, it would be logical to simply offer a 10% premium instead of 15% and undermine all your competition.  
Higher prices usually have a good reason why they come about and are not undercut by competition.

Your node will simply reject the block. If you don't have your own node, you rely on other's nodes to tell you if that block was valid or not.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:34:26


No, using a different address for every incoming transaction is a good practice for privacy.  
A bitcoin address is derived from a public key. A public key is derived from a private key. A private key is derived from a seed.  
You can have a practically infinite amount of (receiving) addresses. As long as you have your seed/your private keys, you have all the bitcoin that is ever been sent to one of those "infinite" addresses. You wallet should automatically take care of handling all of those, but it's critically important to back up your seed properly (the 12 or 24 words that the wallet should give you when you were setting it up). If you don't access to the 12/24 words, you probably should change your wallet.

Depends how much your anonymity is worth to you. You could set up a PO box at your local post office, which costs a bit. Or you could have it delivered to a friend. Or pick one up at a conference in person.  


Just simply make a regular transaction from your Samourai to your new hardware wallet. You also could export the seed phrase (the 12 or 24 words) from Samourai into the HW, but this is absolutely not recommendable practice (because those words have already been online and should not be regarded as super safe for storing large amounts with them). Just set up a new wallet on your HW and send your balance to it.  
You probably should do a very small testing transaction first though. Then wipe the hardware wallet and see if you get the back up process right (you shouldn't lose any funds if you do everything right, and if you do lose them - good that you tested with a small amount!). Helps you keep your mind at peace for the future ;)

According to this very comprehensive samplesize (haha), the latter approach seems to attract more attention :)  But maybe it's just that the topics of that specific issue were more interesting for the readers.

No, "unspent" simply means that the coins are still on the address, but whoever has the private key associated with the address, can move the coins whenever they like. In short, "unspent" = "unmoved". But you cannot reclaim the coins anymore, they're gone. It's also close to impossible to find out the owner of the wallet.  
What might have happened is that your computer has a malware that switches bitcoin addresses when it recognizes one in the clipboard (when you do copypaste). Or something else has gone wrong.

There are no ROI guarantees. Only put in money that you don't mind going to zero in the absolute worst case, or at least that you don't need for the next 5+ years.  
There are people saying that bitcoin goes to zero and people who are saying it will go to 1 million per coin. Understand that both are extremes and there are plenty of scenarios in-between.

Hm, I am not sure I really understand your question.  
You are basically asking if it is safe to make an outgoing transaction from a Ledger Nano S wallet, right? If the seed has a passphrase or not is kind of irrelevant in this context.  
But in general, yes of course it's "safe" (assuming you are not screwing something up like sending to a wrong address or sending a wrong amount or attaching an unreasonably high fee etc) to make an outgoing transaction from a hardware wallet. The passphrase has nothing to do with it. But again, perhaps I misunderstood your question somehow.
@_date: 2019-11-03 15:42:46


because:  
- it's not up to you to decide what any person "really needs" ;) 
- your scenario (bitcoin takes over the world) implies a multi-decade process and a minority of currently alive people has such long investment time horizon  
- it's absolutely possible that bitcoin won't take over the world but will stay relatively niche. No one knows

Yes, such generators exist, but personally, I would not touch it unless I am skilled enough to check their code on my own, and I am not skilful enough for that, unfortunately. I assume no beginner is skilled enough for that either, that's why I strongly discourage paper wallet for beginners :) 
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:42:55
I think you might misunderstand something. You cannot route $100 through a channel with $1 capacity. That's why AMP is needed in the first place.
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:17:41
Ah makes sense, yes. 
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:46:23
It is safe purely from the safety perspective (I am assuming you have set up your Ledger correctly and safely!). There might be privacy implications further down the road, but I guess this is for now beyond the scope of a beginner question.  
If you generate an address with Ledger and give that address to someone, all they can do is to send money to it (and they can follow money movements to/from that address - that's why it's strongly recommended to use a new address for each incoming transaction). They cannot "steal" anything from that address (if that's what you are trying to ask).
@_date: 2018-10-27 22:36:20


The last block rewards before they completely stop will be something like 0.00000004 bitcoin, then 0.00000002, and the last period will be 0.00000001 bitcoin per block. So it's not a big shock when the rewards end. It's phased out very gradually

Imagine throwing darts out into the universe in order to hit a very particular atom.

Or you'd need an infinite amount of time/resources to achieve that (and it pays more to put those kinds of resources into bitcoin mining instead).

Yes this looks like it. The reason it takes so long is that apparently something caused a "forced closing", which means that one of the parties hasn't "agreed" to the closing (because it has been offline f.ex or for other reasons). In this case, the lightning software gives a longer time period for the opposite party to react, in case there has been a cheating attempt. This is why a "forced close" takes more time than a regular close.  
It's not clear though what specifically triggered the close, but your funds should be safu.  
P.S.: there are no dumb questions in this regard. Its a cutting edge technology and everyone is still learning ;)

Allow me to rephrase your arguments in order to see if I get them right :)  
So you are saying that Satoshi's words should be followed as closely as possible, but at the same time you seem to make an assumption that we know that a) **when** he would have like the blocksize to be increased, b) **how large** the new blocksize should be, c) that Satoshi wouldn't have changed his mind down the road and d) that his vague words from 10 years ago should be a definite rule for current set of users today.  
Do I get this right?  
Further, you seem to ask me, a random internet user, what I think about Satoshi's hypothetical opinion, if he were around today. To which I can only say: his hypothetical opinion doesn't really matter for today's protocol (**especially if we are talking about consensus-critical, fundamental changes**), and my opinion about his opinion matters even much less so.  
But even if my opinion is of interest to you still, I gave the answer in the first [reply]( of our thread already.
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:21:41


Yep, that's basically the whole point, I think. No consensus = no (backwards incompatible) changes. If you don't like the rules, don't use it. If you want to change the rules, propose a change and see if there is consensus to it.  


Isn't "set in stone" basically the same as backwards compatibility?

Good explanation in general! I would add though that a node is primarily supposed to help you, the user of the node, to verify your incoming bitcoin (so you don't need to trust blockexplorers or wallets to tell you the truth), and to ensure a higher level of privacy (so you don't leak your transaction details to said wallets' nodes, blockexplorers etc).

- If you’re an activist or a journalist, you may wonder how safe it is to use bitcoin to escape the prying eyes of a government or corporation
- Bitcoin is only semi-private; the protocol doesn’t know your real name but transactions can still be linked to you in a myriad of ways
- Blockchain analytics firms specialize in deanonymizing bitcoin activity and sell this data to corporations and law enforcement agencies
- A grasp of how the system works and use of tools such as Tor, coin control, CoinJoin transactions and avoiding address reuse can make a crucial difference in protecting your identity and transactions from being unmasked


@_date: 2019-03-09 15:06:01
You are linking your bitcoin address to some quite sensitive data (level of investment into bitcoin, method of storage, country of residence). And subsequentially, other transactions in/out of your wallet can be linked to this data.  
This is not very good for privacy. You are giving very personal data away to a completely unknown person for a completely unknown purpose.

yep, it would (provided you wrote everything down correctly etc).  
As long as you don't have much worth on the wallet, you might want to practice deleting your Trezor completely and then re-install with the back up phrase, just to see if everything works and you understand how it is done, before you put more money on it. But be clear that in case of a screw up, your money might be gone completely, so be careful and better ask twice, if you don't understand something.

Yes, you are correct. My point was just that lack of block rewards will be felt much much sooner than 100 years. It's not very far away from now.   


This is an incorrect conclusion though, imo.  
1) it might become even more profitable than today (more people mining) because the price of btc is higher and/or much more people are transacting and 2) if not, it might be considered profitable only by the very big players with super efficient operations, low energy costs etc.  
Other scenarios are also possible.

Yeah I think I agree that it's a kind of "vote with your money" type of thing (like you "vote" for a restaurant by going to it, or you "vote" for bitcoin by holding it instead of your local fiat).  
I guess the main point here is that you need to **use** your node (=connecting your wallet to it) so it is of any value to you. Simply having an unused node on the network doesn't do much, especially not fulfilling any type of a voting role (except that it's of course very useful when you need it and don't have to sync up from scratch). And it's of course important that people run their own nodes instead of relying on third parties (or at least that people have a very easy opportunity to running a full node).

First of all, a full node is a full node regardless if you have port 8333 open or not. It still serves you for verification and privacy **if** you use it for your wallet.  
Second, you can open your port in your router settings. Have you googled for that? F.ex you could google for [your router's name] + [open ports] or something like that.

Afaik(!) tor nodes can be connected to w/o problems, but only if they established a connection first. They are not findable for other nodes otherwise (which shouldn't be a problem if your primary purpose is not routing, but just "regular" transacting... but even if you want to route a lot, it's still possible, just requires a little more "manual" work).  
Again, only my understanding. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can confirm. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:13:11
Good addition! Custodial accounts (any exchange and wallets that don't give you the private key) are a whole different can of worms of course, and can hold your coins "hostage" (and cooperate with law enforcement, KYC/AML obligations etc).
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:20:19
6% is a premium on the trade, which is kind of common. Usually when buying bitcoin you have to choose two of three: cheap - convenient - private.  
Private and convenient (ATM, in-person) is not cheap, convenient and cheap (KYC exchange) is not private, private and cheap is not convenient (need to find people willing to trade) and so on.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:02:33
The vast majority of those transactions has 1sat/byte fees, so you can easily "beat" them by just sending a tx with 2sat/byte and get mined in the next (or the next few) block(s).
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:16:47
The method itself (buying in person in a safe, public place) is legit, but this obviously doesn't say anything about the legitimacy of the seller.  
If this is placed on a platform like localbitcoins or bisq or similar (I don't recognize the platform from the screenshot), there is usually some kind of rating system in place. So pay attention to the rating/reviews (and keep in mind this is not something 100% trustworthy, as it can be gamed also).  
Also keep in mind that this is probably not the best method if you never done a bitcoin transaction before, because you will be nervous and vulnerable to fraud if you don't know what you are doing and what is going on.  
One red flag I see in the text is the "physical wallet to which only you have access to". I would never accept that kind of transaction method with a person I don't know. But perhaps they mean an Opendime, which is legit (but again, you probably won't have an idea how to verify that). 
But yeah, otherwise it seems reasonable (meeting in a safe place, transferring coins into a wallet that **you set up and have full control over**), but keep the pitfalls in mind and be super careful. Better to err on the side of paranoia here.

Nothing is being burned (this would undermine the value proposition of bitcoin, and there is no mechanism for any kind of involuntary "burn" in the first place). It's just the issuance rate gets halved every four years.

@_date: 2019-11-11 11:41:37


Well, this is the tricky part (for now - better solutions are being built by HW manufacturers as Ledger, and Bitcoin Core itself).  
First of all, you need to connect your Ledger to Electrum wallet (instead of using the Ledger's/Trezor's native software). This is super easy, just download Electrum (make sure you are using the correct website!), open it, plug in the Ledger and follow the instructions on the Electrum wallet.  
But by default, Electrum connects to random nodes on the network. In order for it to connect to your own node, you need another piece of software, which makes your node function as Electrum server. You can use either [Electrum Personal Server]( or [Electrs]( for that. Both are open source and free. The downside is that you will need quite a bit of tinkering and setting up things with command line (following the instructions in the links). Depending on how you set up your actual node, you might need to solve some issues on your own (or ask around for advice online).  
Another option is just to follow a step by step guide such as  which has the whole guide for the node + how to connect a hardware wallet to it (with Electrum Personal Server). But it involves dedicated hardware (the Raspberry Pi device itself).  
There might be other solutions/guides I am not currently aware of, so keep that in mind ;)  
It all probably sounds scary at the first read, but I managed to set it up as well (with the RaspiBolt guide) and I am definitely not the most technical person :)  
Also, in the future it will definitely get easier, but who knows when. Open source projects take their time and UX is usually not the first priority here.

Strongly disagree here. Bitcoin will be absolutely fine even if Lightning fails for some reason. That's one of the good things about a off-chain experimentation: the underlying protocol will survive even if there is a monstrous fuck up on the layer above.   
P.S.: OP you should filter better what sources you draw your information input from. Difficult to know when you start out, but "bitcoin billionaires" (or other media people in general) have usually absolutely no clue what they're talking about when it comes to bitcoin.

Yes!  
You cannot use just any wallet though, because there are differences in implementations of the BIP39 standard between wallets, but in general, as long as you have the mnemonic seed (the 12 words) you have your bitcoin, regardless of the wallet.  
You can import that mnemonic seed into an advanced wallet like Electrum and have access to your bitcoin again, even if Mycelium disappears. Be aware that you might need to know something that is called "derivation path" when restoring your wallet. Here is a site that lists the derivation paths for the all the widely used wallets today:

It's not about being supporter of anything. Centralized databases make sense, if you don't need censorship-resistance, immutability etc, but need quick and efficient processes. In the opposite case, decentralized databases have to trade of the speed and efficiency in usecases, where censorship-resistance, immutability, independence from third parties is needed (such as in a trustless currency). BUT, they achieve these properties only by being a part of a system, which also needs cryptography, PoW and consensus mechanisms.  
"Blockchain" by itself does not have these properties, but frequently is sold as the new, shiny, almost magical technology that does, and at the moment vast majority of the people are buying into these claims due to lack of education. That's all I wanted to express.

One of the big differences: bank reserves can be easily and trustlessly verifiable.  
Another difference is that there won't be a lender of last resort or printing of bitcoin if a bank fails. This should incentivize banks to behave (and customers to ask for proof-of-reserves) in the first place.

The crucial bit in the primary source (linked in the tweet), by Christine Sandler, Coinbase’s head of sales:  


I don't think Coinbase has previously disclosed selling of customer's data. This is a pretty big deal. If someone's previously thought that the Neutrino acquisition is overblown, I think the selling of customers data (and not disclosing the leak afterwards) is actually a much bigger deal, justifying every shitstorm this will get.  
Just to give them a slight benefit of the doubt: it might be possible that Sandler meant that the company in question was found to be selling customers data from other companies (not from Coinbase), but this doesn't read like it and if a company was selling data from other places, who can guarantee that they haven't been doing the same with Coinbase's customers? We should be demanding answers from Coinbase. u/stopanddecrypt has some good questions below.  
edit2: here's an interesting article providing  some counter-perspective (but mostly in the sense that it hints that other exchanges are not that much better than Coinbase):     


This part tells us that almost all regulated crypto exchanges rely on services from companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis, and those companies require the exchange **to provide customer data in order to receive analytic services in return**. This doesn't put the whole exchange ecosystem in a good light at all.

The privacy of the receiver suffers more than that of the sender. It's not easy to say how much exactly, because it depends on who is trying to extract which data from the payments, and how concerned you are about being on the radar for some kind of analysis/surveillance.    
You are much more likely to leak information by other means anyway: not running your own full node, buying bitcoin through a KYC-compliant medium (any exchange or regulated service basically), not practicing coincontrol and so on. As long as you haven't taken care of those, you really don't need to worry about paying someone who is reusing their addresses ;)

@_date: 2019-11-06 14:31:00


It's not, under the circumstances you describe.  
You'd need to have a channel available before the purchase. You could do so without any extra costs: f.ex any time you do a regular on-chain transaction, you could put the change output into a LN channel, instead of going back into your wallet. Or other smart ways to open a channel without extra fees. But yeah, they need to be open before you buy a cup of coffee. Once opened, you can keep them up indefinitely.

But realistically, no one is going to bother, I would think.

There are a few possible solutions that'll be available. F.ex, since every transaction has a change output, every time (or just one single time) you make an on-chain transaction for whatever reason, your wallet could use the change output for opening a channel. That way a channel opening would incur zero extra on-chain fees.  
I'm not even a dev, and that's just what came up from the top of my head (I probably read it somewhere previously though). There's a ton of optimization possible. It's still early and nothing is set in stone.

Yes  


Never give your private keys to anyone (no website, no online machine etc). Always doublecheck addresses when sending/receiving (you can check them on Trezor/Ledger device itself).

And a FAQ for privacy (less related to your question, but also good for long-term hodling):

@_date: 2019-11-18 15:02:31


You could, but generating a seed manually is kind of difficult to do properly for a beginner. Also, you need a machine that is guaranteed to be malware free. Then you also won't be able to spend from that seed (so you'd need to bring it online if you want to spend from it).  


You should also set up an additional passphrase (which essentially functions as the 25th word).

No, that's not how it works, as it would make no sense (you'd create money out of nothing) :)  
Think of the last step (node5 to node6). When the payment goes through, node6 would have the funds that have been with node5 before. Where would node5 get the funds in order to get back to the previous balance? Only if node6 makes a payment back in the direction of node5, the balance is restored.  
To make it much simpler: imagine there's only those two nodes, node5 and node6. Node5 makes a payment to node6. The only way to bring the channel balance back to its original state is for node6 to send back the funds (for whatever reason). There's no other way around it.  
It can be for other reasons than a refund (node6 might want to do a new payment, or simply use some rebalancing "tricks"), but funds cannot just appear from thin air.  
Hope that makes it clearer

Both is not "helping" bitcoin. They're supposed to help **you** in the first place (node for privacy/verification, mining for profit).  
That said, if you're a larger scale miner and mine 0-fee transactions or, I don't know, donate your mining profits to some devs or other bitcoin-friendly organization, sure you're helping bitcoin. The question becomes though, if your practices are sustainable for the long run?  
In general, I would say educating yourself and others, helping with code review, helping others learn are probably more helpful for the bitcoin space than spinning up an unused node or running a low-hashrate, inefficient miner.  
But you should do whatever you feel like in any case :)

The problem is that any (custodial) exchange that touches fiat will be obligated to perform KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks on their customers, so they (the exchanges) won't get in trouble with their local laws. And exchanges that are not playing by the rules are cut off from the banking system pretty quickly.  
So if you actually manage to find an onion site that lets you buy bitcoin with credit card, there'll be a pretty high chance that it's a scam.  
Your better bet would be to either use something like HodlHodl or Bisq, or try to get your parents to buy you some on a regular exchange, or a bitcoin ATM in your area, or try to earn some bitcoin through some kind of (online) work etc.

Chiming in here quickly: AFAIK the differences are mostly the LCD screen and the fact that RaspiBolt guide has bonus FAQs on how to run it on Tor and how to connect your hardware wallet to the node.  
Especially the latter part is much more important for me personally, because by connecting your wallet to your node you increase your privacy by a lot (otherwise you are leaking tons of information to Ledger/Trezor) and you minimize your trust to Ledger/Trezor and miners (which essentially is the whole point of running a full node).  
I'm not sure if there are similar guides for Raspiblitz. But for the reasons mentioned above, I would recommend the RaspiBolt (if you decide to set up on your own and not get a ready-made package such as Nodl or Casa).

Otherwise, check  but I think they only list KYC options (where you give up your anonymity).  


Yes, this is basically some very simple form of coincontrol (not mixing your anonymous coins with deanonymized coins). I am not sure though how Trezor works exactly and if it allows for a second wallet. Better to ask support or in their subreddit:

You are not doing any meaningful part in running an unused node ("unused" means: your actual wallet is not connected to it). Of course feel free to run one in any case, just be aware that the main purpose of a full node is to help **you** to better privacy and for minimizing trust into miners and other parts of the ecosystem.  
The easiest way to run a node is to simply download the software from here:  and let it do its syncing job. Be careful though, it's quite storage and bandwidth intensive. You can enable pruning though, so it will only use up ~5 gb on your computer.  
For other options (dedicated, small and cheap mini-computer that can stay online 24/7) see f.ex this guide (you can skip the Lightning section, if you only want a Bitcoin full node):

I'm not an expert on Liquid at all (and neither on Lightning, except that I've dabbled a little bit with it), so just briefly:  
You need to trust the participants in Liquid a little bit (it's not fully trusted system, but federated, which means, the trust is distributed between multiple participants). This is what many people don't like, but they forget that Liquid is mostly for transfers between exchanges (and for large players), and if you transfer to an exchange, you implicitly trust the exchange in the first place.  
Since the exchange is also a participant in the Liquid network, it doesn't have any incentives to misbehave. But still, it's not fully trustless as the on-chain bitcoin network itself.  
Lightning on the other hand, is more p2p and more trustless that Liquid. There are multiple open-source implementations. Everyone can run their own node, connect to any node they like, open/close channels wherever they like etc etc. It's more for smaller and micropayments. Retail customers/merchants, maybe in-game payments and so on. Liquid is more for institutional players (like exchanges).  
There are technical differences: Lightning is a payment channel system, while Liquid is a sidechain. They work completel different. But I'm not that technical to compare both in a deep way.
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:16:20


That's it, yes. Usually people check their transactions on one of the various online blockexplorers, but then you have to trust that those blockexplorers are telling the truth. The point of bitcoin is that you don't need to trust anyone to know which transactions have taken place, and that's only achievable through running your own node.  
Imagine a network where only the blockexplorers are running their node. They'd have a lot of power in this sense, as they would be a source of truth/authority. We all know that authority is abused very easily.  
Another reason is that such blockexplorers can connect your IP to the bitcoin address you are looking up (because most of the people are looking for their own transactions). This kind of privacy leak is also avoided with your own node.  
Hope that makes it more clear :)

There is no "step by step" really. It also depends on what your current level of skills/understanding is, i.e. do you have any experience in contributing to open source projects, developing experience etc?  
Depending on how you answer such questions, there are various things to recommend. If you don't have any coding experience at all, you probably might want to do some kind of introductory Python course online, f.ex.  
If you already have some skills, you might want to read the discussions on the bitcoin dev [mailinglist]( read the discussions in open issues and pull requests in the [Bitcoin Core GitHub repository]( or join the [BIP review club](  
Perhaps also listen to some current Bitcoin Core contributors how they found their way into it, to get some ideas. Here is a great example:   
Also, there are various courses such as [Buidl Bootcamp]( or Jimmy Song's "Programming Blockchain" course which have a more structured teaching, but also cost money.

The hardware itself is worth around half of Casa's price, but obviously theirs come pre-configured and ready to go (I assume), and probably include some kind of customer support. So it's up to you to decide if it's worth it (= if you want to save money and set up everything on your own)

You could consider using bitcoin over credit card if you:  
- want to stay private (to some degree, at least)  
- have a need for a payment that cannot be stopped/censored  
- you or the merchant don't actually have access to the payment network/banking system    
- you have some other external incentive to use bitcoin (merchant discount f.ex)  
- you have some internal incentive (fun to play around with new tech, or you actually want the merchant to save some processing fees, the 2% or whatever they pay to VISA etc)
 
Otherwise, let's be honest, you probably would want to use your credit card, and that's fine, of course (if you're lucky enough to have access to a functioning banking system). Btw, there is no "free money". The credit card company gets the money from the merchants for processing your payment to them, and guess where the merchants get the money from ;)

On Bitstamp there's 4900 bitcoin to sell in the orderbooks right now. And that is not even the most liquid exchange. You could buy your amount on multiple days, or same day on different exchanges (or both). You won't move the market with 150 btc

Ledger has a "secure element" chip which is not open source (but independently audited/reviewed etc), which is a good thing from certain perspectives and a bad thing from others. You have to trust Ledger and the auditing companies, but it makes it secure from certain types of attacks.  
Trezor's chip is open-source, which is a good thing from certain perspectives and a bad thing from others. You don't need to trust Trezor if you can inspect it yourself (or you can trust that the community did a good reviewing job), but it makes Trezor wallets vulnerable to certain types of attacks (which are preventable by setting up a passphrase, essentially a 25th word of the seed).  
While it's great to learn and think about all that, I can almost guarantee you that you will have a much better bitcoin storage setup if you just flip a coin between those two (or get a whole another one, like Coldcard) and invest your time into learning how to setup and use your own full node, how to take care of your private key, how to get bitcoin without KYC and things like that :)

He mentions it right away: "use an address once and only once and then never sign from it again".   
First of all, a part of that best practice is done by all bitcoin wallets automatically: they create a whole new address for every new incoming transaction (so you never should send someone an address that you already sent to someone else).  
The other part would be to always spend funds from a particular address completely. Example: you have 10 bitcoin on address X. You want to send 2 bitcoin to address Y.  
The transaction you create would then basically involve all the 10 bitcoin to be sent, two bitcoin to address Z and remaining 8 bitcoin to a new address Y, which is created from the same private/public key as the original address X.  
This means, you effectively sent only two bitcoin, but the change (8 bitcoin) is still under your control, only on another, new address. This address hasn't revealed its public key yet (which only gets revealed when you send **from** that address). Hence, it is safe from quantum computing.  
Having said all that, this is absolutely not necessary and will not be necessary for a long time (possibly forever), with what we know about quantum computing nowadays.  
What is a good practice though is to never reuse addresses for incoming transactions. This is more due to privacy than to anything else though. And this is a real concern, as opposed to quantum computing.

There are a few legit criticisms of Lightning at its current stage and yet you picked some that are plain untrue :)  
You won't close the channels if you go online. You can stay offline as long as you wish. Probably your counterparty will want to close them at some point, if they see you offline for half a year or whatever, but they can close the channels at any point in time anyway.

Addresses don't expire, but you probably should submit another purchase if it was "a few days", because the fiat value fluctuates and the company won't be too happy if btc drops in price meanwhile (and vice versa, you won't be happy if it rises).  


Almost every centralized exchange requires KYC checks. There might be some services where you could get small amounts without verification, but it depends on your country. Other "instant" options are bitcoin ATMs or buying in person.

Ok thanks again.  
I would like to express that I think this work is important and should be relatively high on the priority list, esp since Ledger would be the only HW with such feature (if this is indeed some simplified, beginner friendly way to connect it to user's node).  
I often encounter people asking how to connect a HW to a node and most of the time they run away when I point them to command line solutions such as EPS. So I think this would be good for you guys if people would be pointed in your direction, when you implement this feature ;)

From what I hear they're pretty quick to turn over customer data to the police authorities (without a warrant), so if that's a problem for you, you might want to consider another exchange (although it's better to assume that every exchange will share data with authorities when they're asked to).

I can only speak for myself here, but if I have to go extra steps to pay with bitcoin, like thinking how to write an email, I am much less likely to pay with it even with 5% discount (although this of course depends on the sum, if it's a large one, obv I'm more incentivized to do the extra steps). I think I'd be more likely to do the 2-3 clicks with something like BTCPayserver than to write an email.

That's called "spread" and is one of the ways Coinbase (and other exchanges, also services/exchanges for foreign currency) make their money. It's the price for convenience.  
You can probably get a better price by using Coinbase pro or an exchange that gets you access to the market price directly (but you need to work through a somewhat more complex interface and understand how to place a limit order f.ex). Or use another app with a lower spread (perhaps CashApp? I'm not sure, haven't used either of those).

Never heard of that wallet nor of that review channel.  
This obviously doesn't need to mean anything, but if you need to put in trust into a hardware wallet (which is an unfortunate reality, because 99% of users are not able to verify the hardware/software on their own, or it's not open source in the first place), you probably should do it with a wallet that has been around for years and got lots of reviews and attacks. This means: Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard.  
It's just my opinion. I have no idea about the second wallet reviewed.

The role of a node is not to "support the network". The network doesn't rely on altruism (if it did, we wouldn't have come this far with bitcoin).

The 6500 USD price for a few weeks is not what makes a great store of value. It's censorship resistant, very hard to confiscate, highly transferrable and movable properties that make it so. If bitcoin crashes to 3000 tomorrow, it will suck and be painful short-term, but these properties will still be there, while the price does what the price does.  




Again, it's not the price. Or was bitcoin dead at $10? $1000?

I am not aware of any features that would allow that (speaking from my experience with the LND implementation at least). So by default, your node cannot directly refuse to route. But you could f.ex hike up the fees in a particular channel so much that it becomes uneconomically to send anything through it. Or simply close the channel.  
This does not mean that the counterparty is **forced** to open a new channel though. They might have other channels already and use them to get their transaction through. Or they might do an on-chain transaction instead. Or not make the transaction at all. Or user another node/wallet, or whatever. You cannot really force anyone to open a channel (or force to do anything, really... that's not how bitcoin works).

How are hodlers afraid of bitcoin's volatility? If you're afraid of it, you don't hodl in the first place. You either don't buy/hold it at all or you dump at the first sight of trouble, thus contributing to the said volatility.  


Why are you assuming that? For many people bitcoin already has "a huge value" (it was worth 0 ten years ago, remember?) and they still haven't sold...  


Supply, irregular demand spikes (and falls) and illiquid markets cause economic bubbles, not people who are valuing bitcoin so much that they are willing to hold it through the bubbles. Without hodlers, without people assigning long-term value to it, bitcoin wouldn't have any value in the first place because it would just be passed like a hot potato (and then ultimately drop out of circulation completely, if it was the case).  
You have a lot of assumptions backwards, it seems :)  
edit: btw, "hodling" doesn't mean "don't sell under any circumstances". It means "don't trade" rather (which is a good advice for the vast majority of people). Of course you can (and should) spend bitcoin if you need to buy something or want to take some money "off the table". In any case, you should do whatever **you** want with your bitcoin, not what other people say :)

This largely depends on your bank and on the method/exchange you are buying at. I don't think large banks in the UK have any issues with regulated exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken etc.   
Or you could use something like bank -&gt; Revolut -&gt; exchange (I am pretty sure Revolut is partner with Bitstamp, and banks don't have issues with Revolut). Do not buy "bitcoin" in Revolut itself though! You cannot withdraw or transfer it from there, they're only selling you a number pegged to bitcoin's price.  
But yes, as others suggested, you also could try to get your bitcoin by other means (ATMs, in-person etc).

No one asks you to do it. Your wallet provider does run a node and you trust them implicitly not to mislead you (and not to spy on you transactions, since they run through their node). That's totally fine and your choice. Some people want to be fully independent of third parties  and they run their own nodes. Everything is voluntary.

The 24 words basically **are** your private key. Anyone who know these words, can control any funds that will be on that private key.  
But yes, in general your understanding seems correct. Your ledger device can create 24 new words (= new private key) after a reset, and that will be your new, clean wallet.  
Please note, that this doesn't exclude the chance that the hardware itself is compromised if you aren't buying from verified reseller. From what I understand, the Ledger device will verify itself online with Ledger's server and will let you know if it is compromised. But I am wayyy to uninformed about the technical side to explain it in depth.

It means that according to the current amount of unconfirmed transactions (and the fees those transactions have attached to them), your transaction has to wait until ~11.65MB have been cleared from the mempool.  
Since one block is somewhere between 1MB and 2MB and is mined every ten minutes on average, you could expect your transaction to be confirmed somewhere within the next two hours or so, but this is only a very rough estimation (it depends on different variables, also more transactions with higher fees can come into the mempool meanwhile).  
You can have a visualized look at the current mempool here:  Actually, looking at that it might be taking longer than 2h, because it looks like more transactions are coming in currently. But sooner or later yours should be confirmed anyway.  
TL;DR: it's your transaction's "position" in the mempool. But this position is not a fixed variable and something more of an abstraction.

- you already have all/most of your money in BTC  
- you want your purchase not be seen by your cc company and cash is somehow not an option (internet purchase f.ex)  
- you worry about censorship of your payment  
Buying bitcoin solely for the purpose of buying some daily good with it doesn't make much economical sense currently, for the reasons you mentioned (and also because essentially no grocery stores accept bitcoin).

Chain analysis is a thing. Something like this:  which is just a public tool, or companies like Chainalysis, Crystal, Elliptic and so on, which collect and analyse on-chain data. They also might be able to connect transactions to your real life ID, especially when you buy from KYC compliant services like Coinbase (and any other exchange, basically).

There are certain, subtle technical trade offs and differences between those two wallets, and one can argue endlessly about them without arriving at a definitive conclusion, so for a beginner it's impossible to decide which subtleties are more important.  
Either of them is a good choice for 99% of users. Having either of those is vastly preferable to have no hardware wallet at all. The rest depends on your technical/ideological preferences (which is basically impossible to decide on for a newbie) and individual threat models.

I guess you could look into Whirlpool by Samourai, or Joinmarket, or simply transferring out of your current wallet bit by bit over time (be aware that with each method you still need to take care of some steps so you don't reverse your privacy efforts by accident, see f.ex FAQs like these:

I used "public address" wrongly, this term doesn't exist actually (there are either "public keys", or just "addresses"), as u/exab pointed out, but anyway:  
Re-using addresses is bad practice because it potentially weakens your privacy. F.ex, if you're a merchant and you give a particular receiving address to every of your customers, **everyone of them can see every transaction by other customers incoming onto this address** (by simply monitoring the address on one of the various blockexplorers). There are also chain analytic firms, which specialize in this kind of knowledge/analysis.  
More info here:   
Your wallet usually gives you a new receiving address each time the "old" one had one transaction incoming, so avoiding re-use is a very simple thing nowadays.

"Can" as in "take it away without your consent"? No, the protocol requires you, the holder of the private key, to sign a transaction before any bitcoin can be sent.  
But "can" as in "make you sign a transaction by force or law"? Sure, although it depends on what jurisdiction you are in and what laws are applicable in that particular situation.

It doesn't require running a node and download the full blockchain. You can use an SPV Wallet or just trust the node of your wallets provider. If you want to go fully trustless, you need your own node. But it's not an obligation. It's the same principle as in bitcoin.  


That's just straight up wrong.  


Both wrong. It's more private than on-chain transactions (which are public for all to see), as no one can see the transactions within a channel (except the parties actually transacting). Also, whom do you trust? It's exactly as trustless as on-chain.

Most likely, it won't be in 195 days. The estimates are imprecise and don't factor in changes in hashrate.  
F.ex, a few months ago the halving was estimated to be on 24th of May, nowadays it's something like 14th of May (because the overall hashrate increased during the last months). It's a rough estimation that gets more precise as we're getting closer to that day.

Yes. Obviously no one can guarantee anything for 100%, esp. not in such cases, but having studied the technology and the space (as far as I can, still consider myself a beginner), I am fairly confident that bitcoin will stay the dominant cryptocurrency, for a variety of reasons, f.ex highest resistance against attacks, modular approach for scalability/infrastructure, most well-tested by time, "immaculate inception" (no pre-mine, no founders rewards, no ICO etc), network effects (check out Trace Meyer's "7 network effects"), advantages for users to converge on one single currency, strongest guarantees for a hard supply cap and so on.  
Most competitors I've seen claim that they have solved such and such problem that bitcoin has (scalability, privacy, tx speed etc), but those do come at unacceptable trade-offs, which are mostly swept under the carpet. There are good reasons why bitcoin is "slow, expensive and inefficient" and it's not because it just is "obsolete tech". Getting these trade-offs right is very tough/impossible, and it seems to me that bitcoin is the closest to getting them right (even though perhaps not perfect).

I like Peter Todd's simple definition of blockchain: it's a chain of blocks.  
My hope is that by defining it this way, it takes out the magic fairy dust out of that word, and helps people understand that a chain of blocks, filled with transaction data, is just a form of a database. Which is not inherently censorship resistant, immutable etc if it's not combined with cryptography, proof of work and a consensus algorithm.  
Leaving it undefined is not helpful for newbies, imo.

It's not about pushing bitcoin (price) to stay afloat, it's about helping quality content to stay afloat (as opposed to trashy memes, misinformation, FUD and so on), because reddit is a huge platform and many beginners come here to learn about bitcoin. It's better if they are exposed to good starting (and advanced) material, instead of being exposed to mentioned trashy content.  
But in order to do that, there needs to be some involvement of the users for upvoting good content and downvoting bad. The vast majority of users are consuming content passively, without ever participate or even up/downvote. Which is totally fine of course, but it would be nice to help good content spread.

Yes, I tend to agree here. There are also solutions available that don't require consensus-critical changes to bitcoin (such as PoW hardfork, f.ex), but do distribute the power from mining pool operators to individual miners. One of such solutions would be [Betterhash]( (I recommend reading that link also to get a better understanding of the problem we are discussing here. It's a great write up by u/stopanddecrypt, one of the mods here).  


From what I understand, he didn't really factored this in as he hasn't factored in the development of ASICs and the resulting mining centralization tendencies. Btw, I also agree in general that mining centralization is a real thing and is not desirable. On the other hand, mining in the early days was wayyyy more centralized, as it was only few individuals(!) mining.  


Yes, disappearance of block rewards needs to be compensated by transaction fees over time.  
This is where we are getting into speculation area, and I am not an expert in this thing in the first place. Even people smarter/more knowledgeable than me disagree with each other on that subject, so keep that in mind ;)  
There is a whole list of "bad case" scenarios that can happen when block rewards disappear and by that time bitcoin's price hasn't multiplied OR a "sufficient" fee market hasn't developed (implying that transaction volume hasn't increased by few magnitudes).  
Those bad scenarios vary from "slightly bad" (increased frequency of short-term reorgs, like 1-3 blocks to "snipe" the fees from other miners) to potentially catastrophic (majority of hashrate disappearing due to unprofitability, thus decreasing the costs of attack). In short, disappearance of block rewards might make state-sponsored attacks (and other attack vectors) more realistic if miners profitability won't be compensated by other means.  
I'll leave this paper here which has some good thoughts as well as some further sources referenced:

If the seed phrase/private key is exposed to any third party, it's not the safest option anymore. The point with hardware wallets is that the private key doesn't leave the device.

Some changes are very contentious (like block increase) and require the consent of the vast majority of the ecosystem (miners, users, developers, businesses etc). If there is no consent, they won't be implemented. Now, miners can dismiss those changes (which is why SegWit implementation took so long, f.ex), but users or devs can dismiss changes, too. It's not that only miners can. This is just how things work in a leaderless system. Either everyone agrees, or no protocol changes will be made.  
(this concerns only far-reaching changes on the protocol level, otherwise the system is permissionless, you can do and build whatever you like on it).

Wirex. Be aware that you're paying 1gbp per month though (they have 0.5% cashback on in-store purchases, so that balances it off a little). Also, it's a KYC'ed service, so they might ask you about source of funds and stuff like that.

@_date: 2018-10-09 17:12:46


No. A "blockchain" is a database, a ledger with entries. A database is not simply decentralized. It has to be distributed and secured by other network participants (miners, users, developers), as well as by PoW (proof-of-work) and cryptography.  


the short answer: nothing really. If people want to give a bank their bitcoin and receive a paper note that says "1 bitcoin" or something, without ever asking for proof of reserves, we'd be having something similar to our current fiat system.  
The difference is that with bitcoin we have now a choice for an alternative to fiat. And no bank has the power over bitcoin (or to print more bitcoin). But ultimately, it's up to us (people in general) what we want to do with this option.

Transactions being "in the open" on bitcoin's blockchain is obviously not optimal in regards to privacy, but they serve a very specific purpose: easy and trustless verifiability of the coin supply and transactions being valid (no double spends etc).  
There are various features that help to protect user's privacy in different ways (the way how nodes broadcast transactions, Tor support, avoidance of address reuses etc etc), but this fundamental trade-off of privacy vs verifiability remains.  
There are various solutions like coinjoin (Wasabi, Samourai, Joinmarket), coincontrol (where you don't mix your KYC'ed UTXOs with non-KYC'ed ones) and also second layer solutions (Lightning, Liquid with Confidential Transactions) that help to improve your privacy. But yes, it is mostly on the user to take care of their privacy themselves.  
There is a great bitcoin wiki article here, describing the issues and solutions in greater detail:

the problems with sending straight from the exchange are that the exchange usually doesn't instantaneously send your transaction, they might hold it off for a while (and your order might expire by then). Also, exchanges don't usually support payments to third parties (they wouldn't know if you send it to a buddy, but to a merchant with a known wallet address they might be able to know).

He mentions it right away: "use an address once and only once and then never sign from it again".   
First of all, a part of that best practice is done by all bitcoin wallets automatically: they create a whole new address for every new incoming transaction (so you never should send someone an address that you already sent to someone else).  
The other part would be to always spend funds from a particular address completely. Example: you have 10 bitcoin on address X. You want to send 2 bitcoin to address Y.  
The transaction you create would then basically involve all the 10 bitcoin to be sent, two bitcoin to address Y and remaining 8 bitcoin to a new address Z, which is created from the same private/public key as the original address X.  
This means, you effectively sent only two bitcoin, but the change (8 bitcoin) is still under your control, only on another, new address. This address hasn't revealed its public key yet (which only gets revealed when you send **from** that address). Hence, it is safe from quantum computing.  
Having said all that, this is absolutely not necessary and will not be necessary for a long time (possibly forever), with what we know about quantum computing nowadays.  
What is a good practice though is to never reuse addresses for incoming transactions. This is more due to privacy than to anything else though. And this is a real concern, as opposed to quantum computing.

The main point is that you're playing right in the hands of altcoin promoters by making "fast and cheap" one of the main definitions (selling points even) of bitcoin. When the fees spike again, you can refer to this definition and say, "see, bitcoin used to be fast and cheap but it's not anymore" and then claim that coin Y ist better or coin Z is now bitcoin.

There is no linear, neat progress bar a tech can reach in this regard. There are various things that have been "reached" in terms of blockspace efficiency (more exchanges/services using batching, SegWit, even bech32 -&gt; blockspace being used more efficiently), and LN continues to mature and draw more traffic (smaller and/or frequent payments) which might contribute to take some fee pressure off the chain.  
The basis property of the protocol stays the same though: blockspace is a scarce good, and demand for it is flexible (at the moment it's somewhat low but it can, and hopefully will, spike again at some point). Spiking demand means higher fees (basic "supply and demand" economics).

Also I would recommend not equal bitcoin (protocol/money) with "bitcoin the reddit sub".

Putting non-transactional data on bitcoin's blockchain is not something that makes sense for an average user (and specifically with documents or larger files it's not usually something that would make sense at all), that's why you don't see any guides or explanations how to do it.  
Basically, every transaction allows a tiny bit of extra data to be written into it, but it's not enough to put in a whole document. For that, you need multiple transactions (costly) and a special way of encoding/decoding the file. F.ex, someone encoded bitcoin's whitepaper as pdf into the blockchain. You need to take many steps in order to encode it:   
What is much more common is to *timestamp* documents on the blockchain, f.ex with something like [OpenTimestamps]( This allows you to trustlessly verify that a file (a pdf, a picture or whatever) existed in the past. For that you only need to put the hash of that file into the blockchain.  
So f.ex if you wanted to timestamp a document today, like your wedding certificate, you could do so with OpenTimestamps and in the future you'd have a trustless, immutable proof that this document existed today. You'd still need the actual document in the future though to compare the hashes.

Check out the sidebars/FAQs (or "community info", if you're on reddit mobile) on this subreddit here, and simply pick one of the bigger names.

They're good for fiat purposes, but they're misleading with their "crypto" service: you cannot withdraw bitcoin, nor deposit it, nor does the merchant receive bitcoin if you try to pay with it. You don't have control over your private keys (you don't actually even see them). So it's not a "crypto exchange" in any sense. They're selling you numbers pegged to the price of bitcoin, not the real thing.

What's the connection between this and Stanford Prison experiment?  
Besides, I find Riccardo's tweet disingenuous. Of course there is a subset of "over the top" people or straight up trolls in every (online)community, but vast majority of "bitcoin maximalists" I've encountered are very much open to the idea that theoretically, there might be something in the future that is "better" than bitcoin (regarding censorship-resistance, immutability, security, decentralisation etc, not regarding "bigger blocks, faster confirmations" etc). They just don't see it on the horizon at this moment.  
Also, the overwhelming majority of tokens and cryptos very much deserve to be called scams and failures. It might look toxic to someone not familiar with the space, but calling a scam a scam is only honest, imo.

Just a reminder, using a VPN for surveys of such kind (where you give some amount of private data) is recommended, so your IP is not linked to the data you are giving away.

I'm not an accountant, so do your own diligence and such.  
But generally, this sounds reasonable. Be aware that you'll need to pay a small transaction fee (mining fee), so maybe you'd buy something like $1 worth of bitcoin more than required.  
Also, be aware that Coinbase probably doesn't allow you to send from their account to third parties. Most likely they won't know whom the receiving address belongs to, but just to let you know. Perhaps it's better to create your own wallet (on your phone/laptop), send from Coinbase to it, and from there to your contractor.

@_date: 2018-10-09 18:04:21


First of all, the block size was increased last year. We have blocks over 1mb now.  
There is a strong argument that increasing the block size too much will prohibit people from running their own full node on cheap hardware/weak internet. The cost of running a node (which lets you verify transactions without relying on third parties) is important, because if it's too high, people will **have** to trust third parties, and **that** will lead to increased centralization.  
Re: pushing off transactions: yes, 2nd layer solutions like Lightning may take off some traffic from the on-chain traffic, but the argument there that this traffic wouldn't have existed on-chain in the first place (microtransactions, tx that need instant confirmation etc), so it's not like Lightning "steals" all the traffic. For larger payments you'd still want to use on-chain, and Lightning channels have to be opened/closed on-chain anyway.

The missing thing is that no one can stop this transaction, regardless who the sender and the receiver are, where they live etc, even though the transaction is for all the public to see. Try sending a few millions across borders through the banking system (even if it goes through, you'll pay a whole bunch of fees and will probably to wait a few days/weeks) , or try to walk with them over any border... Also, no third parties involved, which can be security holes or straight up "bad players"

It's really difficult to recommend something regarding a career in a new, emerging field where there are no clear career paths, but perhaps some things to consider:  
- join a (or some) open source projects and build up a reputation of a good contributor (through code review etc). That's immensely helpful to figure out what you enjoy doing, to learn, to build up some "portfolio" and also helpful to the project itself  
- go to meetups, hackathons, conferences etc, to see what people are talking about, what they're building and to potentially make some connections  
- listen to some podcasts with bitcoin developers for inspiration how they got into development (check out  f.ex, he had a few bitcoin core devs on)  
- Twitter is helpful (although lots of work to curate a list and filter through noise) 
- there are some cool online bootcamps ("Buidl" bootcamp by Justin Moon) which give good insights into the code and perhaps provide for some networking opportunities. Another awesome project is the "Chaincode Residency":  (I think it's full currently though)  
- consider joining the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club:   
In any case, you will need a lot of time and humbleness in order to learn and to figure out what you enjoy, what your skills are and how to sustainably make a living from them. Being an open source dev is not something one starts off to become rich though, so I hope you'll have a lot of fun in the process, too :)

No, you're correct. "Private" usually means, your browser doesn't save  the history and doesn't accept cookies. It doesn't mean it hides your IP from the sites that you visit! Brave has the "Tor private window" though, that's a little more private.

There are multiple things that I would consider red flags in that message (1h is very long for a survey, "a particular good transaction"(?), why a phone call in the first place, disclosing private information).  
I took a look at the u/florravenna's posting history and seems indeed they are in the Lightning development for the Muun wallet:   
But in any case, be super careful with giving out private information (especially a phone number!) to anyone. My advice would be not to share such details with anyone online.  
*Edit: I had a DM chat with u/florravenna and think it's a legit researcher for the Muun wallet, just perhaps unaware that there a lot of phishing activity going on here over DMs. I recommended to put in a little more information about the type of research (and what kind of information is being asked and why etc). But in any case, every user should always be vigilant about the type of information they disclose and to whom.*

Generally recommended wallets are:  








For a really sovereign usage of bitcoin, you should run your own node (all the wallets give you control over your private keys, but they are still connected to nodes of the wallet, so you have to trust them to some degree).

I don't have a link at hand, so I'll try to explain it myself.  
When you use a hardware wallet (or any wallet), you already use a node. It's just someone else's node, not configured by you. This means, when you receive a bitcoin transaction, you implicitly trust the wallet's creators for all the things that are mentioned in the OP (that the tx is valid, that you are on the right chain, if there is a possibility of a contentious chain split, that the 21 million cap is not broken and all that).  
You are also trusting the wallet's node not to collect any information that your wallet sends to it (f.ex the wallet generates a new address for every incoming transaction for privacy, but your wallet's node can link all the generated addresses together, and link it to your identity).  
Using your own full node fixes all this.

They cannot really create it, but they can pretend that they do have more than they actually have (fractional reserve, and also see f.ex [the Dole Food case]( where a brokerage sold more Dole Foods shares that they had).

The whitepaper never stated the 21 million hard cap either and yet here we are and that's one of the most valuable properties of bitcoin today. Btw, I don't agree that it's either or (store of value vs medium of exchange). It can be (and it is) both. And of course it's neither perfect nor without need for improvements yet.   


First of all, the number in fiat shrinks because the price of bitcoin, uhm.. "shrinks" ;)   
But yeah, the amount of btc in the channels seems to have gone slightly as well. I would add though that many channels are private and don't announce their balance at all (nor their existence in the first place). F.ex one of the most popular Android wallets (Eclair) has private channels by default.  


This was debunked afaik:   
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:17:34
It will take a long time, as fees are extremely low (fraction of a cent per transaction), and the competition will be high. You might be able to gather some beer money with a node with well-balanced channels, but even that is some time off in the future.  
Just my impression, might be wrong here. I don't have any special knowledge, just what I'm observing :)

The big question for me would be: do you want to cash out all your money into EUR upon arrival?  
There is more than enough liquidity on BTC/EUR sites like Bitstamp, Kraken etc. But if you wanna cash out everything at once, the exchange and/or the receiving bank might get curious and block your transfer and demand proof of sources, which can be a real pain in the ass.  
Then, if you managed to cash out all of the money to the bank, the German tax authorities might get curious. That's a REAL pain in the ass.  
On the other hand, you save yourself fees and troubles dealing with your bank, shipping the monies from US to Germany, which also might be worth a lot.  
So there are different trade offs and risks, depending on how exactly you plan to proceed with your monies. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:30:53
A "wallet" is not the same as a "public address". You can look up a public address on various blockexplorers. You cannot look up wallets anywhere (and that's a very good thing for privacy, otherwise it would mean you can link public addresses as belonging to one person/entity).  
Usually, a wallet contains many public addresses. Meaning, you can have 10 bitcoin in your wallet, but if you received them in 20 different transactions over a period of time, the particular public addresses will show only 0.5 bitcoins each (or whatever amount you received with each single transaction). Because your wallet creates a new public address for every transaction that you receive.   
Keep this in mind for your study, otherwise your research will be flawed right from the start.

One of the most interesting finds emerges when you start hammering on the buttons quickly (so a lot of iterations are created), trying to be random. You might fool the computer for a while (so that his correct guesses are around 50%), but after a while (200-300 iterations, or even less) it seems to "crack" you patterns and from there your success in fooling it goes down rapidly. Really cool :)  
Another find is that it seems to be biased towards guessing "left" at the beginning, but it seems to adjust quite quickly.

May I ask why you think you might require an advisory service?  
Personally, I would strongly recommend holding bitcoin yourself, without trusting any third party. You should understand how to do that safely, which involves a bit of reading (and asking too, probably), but then you don't need to trust a third party, save on fees (and avoid potential pitfalls like outright scams etc).  
Very simplified, the process is  
1. learn a bit  
2. create your own wallet 
3. write down your recovery phrase and store it in a safe place  
4. buy bitcoin  
5. transfer it to your own wallet   
That's basically it.

You got the basics right. Trezor (or any other hardware wallet) is just a tool. The back up (also called "seed", or "back up phrase" etc) is what's important. Anyone who has access to the seed, has access to your bitcoin. And if it's lost/inaccessible (and the hardware wallet is inaccessible too), then it's game over. So take good care of it.

@_date: 2019-11-01 10:03:45
You make a few assumptions that aren't necessarily true and I think you also might misunderstand a few things (it's a complex topic, to be fair).  
First of all, geographical centralization is obviously not something desirable. It doesn't mean that getting hold of the hashpower is a trivial thing though. Mining pools are not the same as the hashpower they pool. A mining pool situated in China does not imply that all the hashpower that is directed to it is actually in China. An individual miner from Peru could point their hashpower to F2Pool or whichever Chinese pool we want to take as an example.  
Secondly, "taking control of hashpower" implies some violent takeover, either by simple force or by law. Despite what we might think of countries like China or Russia, they are not lawless territories. Taking over the whole industry is not that happens overnight or without fight.  
Thirdly, even if we assume that a government takes over control of a large percent of hashpower in their jurisdiction - it still is more profitable for them to play by the rules of protocol (just mining "honestly") than to go ahead and try destroy it (emphasis on *try*). This is inherent in the design of bitcoin. The government has to be either irrational and waste huge amount of money or they need another (rational) reason to waste this kind of money. It's not impossible to find such a reason (destroy bitcoin completely, f.ex), but again: 1) it pays more to keep it alive and get paid by it and 2) the destruction is not guaranteed at all, as there are also nuclear options like forking the PoW or another cryptocurrency can take over bitcoin's place, with some adaptions to that particular attack vector.  
Fourthly, getting control &gt;51% of hashpower does not mean you can steal people's money or anything. You gain the theoretical power to doublespend (theoretical, because when people learn about this take over, they'll be careful not to let doublespends happen and wait for more confirmations) or to censor transactions. This is not an end for bitcoin in itself, even though a huge blow, of course.  
There are some further subtleties and points that are subject to discussion in all this, as well as speculation (f.ex attacks could get easier over time, when block rewards decrease), but yeah, it's a huge and complex topic.    


If 50% of hashpower disappears, it doesn't mean there are no new blocks and no transactions possible on the network. It will be slower for a while, but then readjust with the difficulty adjustment mechanism.  
edit: I guess I missed your actual question in all this.  


Your own node can protect you from miners misbehaving in certain ways (mining more coins than allowed by protocol, mining invalid transactions, hardforking the chain, introduce a new set of rules or softening rules of the protocol etc), but it doesn't protect from miner majority censoring transactions or misbehaving in certain other ways.  
In the theoretical situation where there is indeed some irrational actor that gets control over &gt;51% of hashpower with the intention of wasting huge amounts of money on the attempt to destroy bitcoin, running your own node won't really help here. What protects you is reality and (economical) incentives of the mining industry.

Segwit is a particular piece of code (very roughly: a change how data in a block is structured). The way this piece of code was planned to be introduced on bitcoin involved a majority of miners signalling for it. But most miners didn't signal for it (presumably because it took away some secret advantage called "Asicboost" from some of the miners).  
The progress stalled for a long time. So some businesses and persons tried to introduce a compromise between users/devs and miners, which was called Segwit2x. The catch was that this "compromise" involved an increase of the blocksize, which was very contentious and most users (and vast majority of the devs) were strongly against it (because it is a dangerous engineering trade-off, and also because Segwit itself already introduced a block size increase).  
So the "compromise" was seen mostly as an attack on bitcoin (because it mostly served some corporation's interests). It was a consensus breaking proposal and a technical failure (the code that was supposed to run SegWit2x actually had a critical bug, as turned out later).  
Some of the people who pushed SW2X apologized later (see OP, also Wences Casares), or simply left bitcoin. But most people haven't apologized or even acknowledged their mistake and are since then somewhat shunned/trolled by bitcoiners for that.  
TL;DR: SegWit2x was an attempt to introduce a contentious change into bitcoin's codebase by some businesses/corporations and some single persons. This was seen as an attack by most users and got rejected.

Every KYC compliant exchange works with chain analytic companies, and who knows what kind of data they share (knowingly or unknowingly) with such companies.  
Your best bet is to either avoid KYC services as much as possible, and/or use privacy-enhancing practices to reduce the link between your identity and your coin movements. Meaning: learn what [coincontrol]( is (and use a wallet that allows for it, like Electrum or Wasabi), don't mix you KYC'ed coins with anonymously acquired coins, use coinjoin services like Wasabi or Samourai, use your own node, use Tor and so on.  
It all will seem complicated and difficult at the first glance (and it is, unfortunately), but you also don't have to do and understand everything at once. Small steps, and ask whatever is unclear along the way.

Having read and compared both (on a surface level), I must say I prefer Belcher's version. Ideally I would like his version with an addendum of some references/guides how to go ahead with a paper wallet if one understands the risks and still wants to do it, but I think it's better to err on the side of caution when dealing with beginners. And I don't think I ever seen non-beginner enquire about paper wallets here (and from my impression on r/bitcoinbeginners). Imo the previous version doesn't get enough into the pitfalls (change addresses, possible pitfalls and leaks at the moment of creation etc), which can be critically dangerous for a newb.

You have to realize that all you have on Coinbase is **a promise** to pay you bitcoin. Until you actually withdraw and take hold of your bitcoin, you don't even know if they will pay out (they can freeze your account for whatever reason, they can be hacked, go belly up etc).  
As the popular saying goes: not your keys, not your coins. As long as Coinbase (or whatever custodian) has the bitcoin on their keys, they are not yours.  
A proper wallet gives you (and you alone) the private keys, with which you control your bitcoin without having to ask any third party.

There is something called "watch only wallet", which can receive but not send, but by default a wallet is something that has your seed/private key and can send.  
If you transfer out from Coinbase, pay attention that you pick a proper wallet which lets you control your private keys (using the term interchangeably with "seed" here). As the saying in bitcoin goes: "not your keys, not your bitcoin".  
Some of the generally recommended wallets are:

I think you're wrong here  


Bitcoin devs don't have the power to decide what users want. But yes, I agree that PoW change won't happen (except for some kind of a catastrophic emergency).  
You seem to want to make a financial decision based on some principals, which are unclear to me, but it seems that you misunderstand the current PoW system and its impact on the environment, as well as misjudge its sustainability. But it's just my opinion, the future is always uncertain.  
You might be interested in this study by Cambridge about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, especially its FAQ:

You have to understand that market cap is a shitty metric anyway. If I create 1.000.000 Muffincoins, and sell one coin to a friend for $1, suddenly Muffincoin has a $1.000.000 market cap (simplified, but that's how it works roughly). So what are the implications of one coin overtaking another in that chart?  
If something ever replaces bitcoin (which doesn't seem likely at this moment), it might be reflected in the market cap, but it will be not the main reason why bitcoin got replaced.

Running a node to help the network is a noble goal, but it doesn't really help the network, except adding a tiny little bit more redundancy.  
What a node does primarily, is to help YOU: namely, to verify the transactions for you and to make sure the bitcoins that you are receiving are indeed "real" and that you are on the "right" chain.  
The other advantage, besides sovereignty, is that it gives you more privacy, too. Otherwise if you connect to a third party node (f.ex that one of Ledger or Trezor), potentially it can see your IP, your transactions etc. If you are privacy minded, you gotta run your own node.

Are you sure the people also actually want to receive BTC? Not that you just waste your precious sats and they're not being claimed (or being claimed by the tip bot creators at some point in the future) :)  
There is a Lightning tipping bot, which only works in this sub though:   
There is also something like  which you can use to tip people on Reddit or Twitter. They'll get the satoshis linked to their username, and have to verify themselves by logging into bottle through Reddit (bottle doesn't see their passwords etc).  
Another way is to simply ask the person you want to tip for their bitcoin address or a Lightning invoice.

~~That's the part why there's confusion. That second transaction will **not** be rejected, as you seem to think. It's a fully valid transaction and will be broadcasted (and reach the miner) just fine.~~
~~It would be an invalid transaction only if the first transaction (which spends the same coins/inputs) would already have 1 or more confirmations, but since it has 0, both transactions are still competing for confirmations (and the one with the higher fees will win)~~

Yes, create a new address with your hardware wallet and send it over to this new address. Make sure to double and triple check everything (addresses)!  
Also, I am not sure how exactly an imported paper wallet handles change addresses. There might be a possibility for a screw up if you are sending only a part of your balance, so it's probably recommendable to send all of your balance at once. See also   
Keep in mind the last paragraph is only a speculation on my part, I don't know for sure, so perhaps wait for someone to confirm on this.

People are hyped up about LN (understandably) but no one in their right mind calls it the solution to ALL problems. It's a super cool tech and will empower many usecases previously not possible with bitcoin (micropayments, insta tx's, payment streams etc), but it won't solve *all* the problems
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:18:39


Not at all suggesting that (was mentioning it just as one of the pieces of the whole picture). I am aware that the node count etc is easy to spoof anyway.  
Also, I am not talking about destroying bitcoin, centralizing it etc. I am enquiring about the possibility of those large players to block further privacy features (like there was an impasse with SegWit before UASF). We are all saying that user determine the network (users also implying here developers and miners), but if KYC institutions become large users of the network as well, will there be able to block softforking Schnorr etc? That was my question :)

Issuing their own tokens is a huge red flag. Vast majority of the time it doesn't make any sense at all and is a thinly veiled pretense to print money out of thin air.

Contrary to the answers that are often given here, the network doesn't care for benevolence. Running your own node serves you in the first place, for privacy and for verifying incoming transactions. Everything else is not really important.

It's possible in theory, because all of the protocol code is completely open source.  
In practice, finding something significant to solve AND to solve it so that it satisfies high engineering standards, passes peer review/discussion, gets thoroughly tested etc, is very difficult. You'd need a lot of mind share to do that, and why should people work on your version, if they instead can work on the current one (with more network effects, more dev mind share, more security etc etc)?  
But even if you manage that, you'd still need to convince all current users and miners to switch to a new chain, which is practically impossible (except perhaps for a system critical bug on the current chain).

I'd argue, it depends why the market is crashing. Generally, if it does (badly), people will want to withdraw from any kind of assets into cash, to pay their bills and to avoid volatility in general. In other scenarios, where it is more a political instability (potential capital controls, censorship etc etc), bitcoin might appear more interesting, as it offers a good alternative to the local currency.

It's the decrease usage in general, but also batching got more popular, and SegWit made the transaction size smaller (smaller tx = lower fees). And SegWit numbers [have been growing constantly]( so transaction size got smaller overall

The answer depends on your current financial situation (will you need fiat money within the next 3-10 years? Do you have any debt? Do you have some money in an "emergency fund"? etc), on your current understanding on what bitcoin is, and if you understand how to secure your coins long term.

As someone else already mentioned here, LN has some benefits over on-chain transactions, such as more privacy (on-chain tx's are visible for all, LN tx are only visible for sender/receiver) and strongly decreased dependencies for confirmations (and lack of exposure to 0-conf transactions)

Very good attitude :)

this is very likely the explanation. I'm not very familiar with Bread, but I assume it will need to finish syncing before displaying the funds correctly.

Yes, that's correct. Consider f.ex this (batched) transaction (which belongs to Bitstamp, afaik): 
  
Presumably each of the outputs (addresses on the right) represent a withdrawal by a distinctive customer of Bitstamp. If Bitstamp wouldn't batch, it would create single transactions to each one of these addresses. But instead, it creates one single transaction, which simultaneously sends coins to all of the clients.

Doublespending has nothing to do with invalid blocks (edit: well, it does, but not in this context of reversing transactions). It has to do with producing an alternative chain, in which your original transaction is reversed/altered. Both chains are valid (not containing any invalid blocks), but if you have the majority of hashpower, you can produce a longer chain and reverse the original transaction. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:38:47

I used Mycelium in the past but stopped, as I remember their fee estimates sucked and wasn't fan of the general UX as well.

And, for a brief period, they introduced third party advertisements in the wallet, which sucks immensely (and that considering they did a fundraise for 11 million USD).

It all depends on the platform you buy at.

Then there are bitcoin ATMs where you get the coins from the machine operator. Or centralized services that act as seller. You can also buy straight from the miners if you have the connections, and so on.

You can download all open source wallets directly from GitHub. Not sure how this works for smartphone wallets, but there is certainly a way to circumvent PlayStore as well.  
Your scenario (blacklisting addresses) is pretty much unenforcable in practice. How many hops between the blacklisted address and a new address exactly will be ok? What about coinjoining techniques? Don't forget addresses are pseudonymous, too. If you done everything right (practicing coincontrol f.ex), no one should know that a specific address belongs to you.  


This doesn't work, because every "tainted" bitcoin can spread across the network over time, "tainting" everything on the network (so that the "taint" loses its meaning).

That sounds good for now. Does it (the blockexplorer) also shows the new transaction that you tried to send? Or only the incoming transaction?

Good post.  
Just to add for more clarity: building on a raspberry pi should cost around $150, and setting up a node on your laptop/desktop is completely free (and as easy as downloading the [bitcoin core client]( and let it sync). ;)
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:29:06
You'd be better off using a hardware wallet (because it stores your keys offline), and connect it to your node. The HW keeps your keys safe, and the node keeps your privacy and verifies your transactions. This is the best set up, but it requires a little of effort (you'll need additional software like Electrum and Electrum Personal Server). Also, I'm not entirely sure if it works with the Casa node.  
In any case, a hardware wallet is more secure than any kind of a "hot" (online) wallet.

It's probably helpful to know what angle you plan to present it - more as an investment, or a cultural phenomenon, or from a programmers perspective, or really just as a super quick, high level overview of what it is?  
If the latter, I would try to talk about bitcoin's properties (decentralized, immutable, permissionless, borderless, open source) and how it achieves those properties.  
Perhaps this gives some inspiration (esp the "Explain Bitcoin Like I'm Five" article):

A blockchain is... A chain of blocks with data.  
The questions are: how is "writing access" determined (who gets to write the data)? How is verification of the data solved? And how/where is this chain of blocks stored?  
Depending on how you solve these questions, you either have a centralised or a decentralised blockchain (and some shades of grey of between). But in the most basic sense, a blockchain is really just a chain of blocks. Not much more.

I strongly suggest getting a hardware wallet, learning how to use it and withdrawing your btc as soon as you can. Storing btc on an exchange is inherently unsafe (it's a huge third party risk, prone to hacking, government intervention, at will of the exchange etc).

Explanation of what specifically?
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:26:02


good point  


I understand this in case of segwit, where nodes create segwit transaction and miners are strongly incentivized to mine these. But if we assume that miners don't have (short-term) economical incentives to mine small blocks, and bigger blocks are not rejected by nodes at all, how would a soft-fork play out then in this case?  
Also, if the economy comes to an agreement that smaller blocks are necessary due to low fees situation, miners simply could choose to limit their block size without a softfork?

The funny thing is, "visiting this sub to bolster their already held beliefs about bitcoin" works for people who are positive about bitcoin as well as for people with negative opinion on it :D  
If you are a bitcoiner, your confirmation bias lets you pick the positive sides... and if you are anti-bitcoin, all you'll be able to see would be how stupid bitcoiners are, how much waste of time and energy it is and so on.  
Confirmation bias works for all groups ;)

When two "competing" blocks are found at the exact same time, a part of the network sees one block first, the other part sees the other block, and then there is a temporary confusion (split) on the network. 
This is resolved by the next block found: it has to be built on either of the two competing blocks. Whichever block is built on first, is the "winner" and the other block gets discarded.  
This used to happen often (multiple times per week or so?), nowadays it seems somewhat rare. In any case, it's just a natural occurrence and is an effect of how bitcoin network works.

I've read the first 6-7 pages. There are a lot of expressions that are kinda vague and don't really explain anything. F.ex:  


Your targeted audience doesn't know what the hell a "decentralized blockchain" is and how a "peer operates" and why it's trustless. You need to explain the words more carefully and not just say them.  
Or:  


It's not "stored on a blockchain". A blockchain is a database with a very particular way to attach new data. I understand what you are trying to say and you are not even wrong, but imo putting it like this doesn't contribute to the comprehension of the reader.  
Some other things: 


"Antifragile" (at least as intended by Taleb) does not merely mean "hard to break". It means "thriving through disorder" or "thriving on being attacked".  


This is a meaningless and unnecessary definition, especially for a reader who doesn't even know what a "decentralized virtual currency" is (which is the target audience for a book). You just made everything less clear.    


Ok, this is kinda funny :)  


No, only you yourself can update the software (if you run your own node). The developers have no power in this regard, and there is no "push" mechanism for updates. A user (= node maintainer) has to manually download the software, if he wishes to update it.   


Store of value does not mean "rare". There are other properties that are required for an asset to become a SoV instrument: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, being easy to verify, staying stable (or increase in value) over time, and... time.   
You have a lot of work to do, but thumbs up for effort, you'll get there eventually!

There are few technical differences between those two wallets that are probably irrelevant for a beginner. Both wallets are fine. Don't fret too much on which one to buy - either one is much better than storing bitcoin on an exchange. Also, the more dangerous source of failure is on the user's side: failing to store the backup phrase properly, not checking addresses on display before sending/receiving and so on.

@_date: 2019-08-21 09:25:46
One of the reasons:  
If you are in any kind of bitcoin-earning business (mining, merchant etc), your business is highly dependent on bitcoin's price not falling. As we see, bitcoin price fluctuates a lot. So if you're a merchant and you don't want to go out of business just because bitcoin's price dropped and stayed down for a while, you can bet a percentage of your funds on a falling price with the futures.  
This is called hedging and can be a very critical thing for a business. This is the same in any other industry: if you are a farmer, you can hedge with betting a small portion of your funds on falling crop prices (or whatever) and be fine if the prices fall indeed.

Besides what u/acered24 said about the technical infeasibility (blockchain is a very inefficient and expensive way to store data, especially resources-intensive data such as pictures etc): blockchain is not a truth machine how you envision it to be.  
It can serve as a very reliable, immutable timestamping mechanism. F.ex, you can timestamp a document to prove its existence at a certain point. But no mechanism can prove that the **content** of that document is "truthful". You only can prove that the document existed at a certain time in the past.

Very briefly:  
* KYC compliant  
* contributed to a contentious protocol change (SegWit2x), which widely was considered an attack on bitcoin  
* has an odd invoice standard for their webshop implementations, which breaks compatibility with a lot of popular bitcoin wallets   
* lets customer overpay on miner fees too much  
A good alternative is BTCPayserver (no fees, no KYC, fully open source, non-custodial), which requires a bit of effort to set up (it has a great, helpful community which will help you out if you stuck), or opennode, which has some fees but AFAIK a little less effort to set up.

I see very many bitcoiners taking issues with that, I guess our perceptions are different in this case :)  
Also, Ethereum argues to be a platform for dapps (a virtual machine), and is supposed to use Ether as the gas which powers these dapps. So inflation in this construct makes sense. But bitcoin was especially built as deflationary currency system, so I think at least in the foreseeable future there will be a lot of people/groups adamantly arguing against any kind of systemic inflation.

Also understand that he is talking to traders (short-term speculators), not hodlers (long-term investors). If you want to be in the first group, go ahead and trade but be aware that it's essentially gambling if you don't know what you're doing (and even if you do, it's gambling with an uncertain edge, because you are very very very likely to **not** have an edge in the market). Also, you are creating potential tax events on every trade, which can turn a tiny positive edge (if it exists at all) into a negative one.
If you're a hodler, you just have to clench your butt cheeks and weather through the bear markets.

Many people here don't seem to understand how taxation works in crypto-&gt;crypto trades.  
Example:   
Coin A is $10 worth. You bought one coin A. It appreciates in value and now it's worth $20. You decide to trade it for coin B, which at the time of trade is $5 worth. So you trade one coin A for four coins B.   
What people don't get is that you just triggered a taxable event, because you made a profit of $10, and you have to paid tax on those $10, even though you never converted coin A into fiat.  
To make things worse, if coin B suddenly loses all its value while you hold it, you still owe taxes on your  profits, even if you never "cashed out" into fiat.  
That's how people can get absolutely rekt by financial authorities, and that's why trading should be discouraged for newcomers.

Great job, OP!  
Just a reminder: pools (as depicted in this gif) do not actually run the whole hashpower that they *pool*. The hashpower is ran by individual miners that connect to that pool. They can withdraw their hashpower at any time (we've seen that already when one pool in the past started approaching 50% and individual miners withdraw their power from that pool). This means, the number of pools itself doesn't tell us a lot about the status of mining decentralization.  
F.ex, there could be a whole lot of different individual miners connecting to a limited number of pools (= more decentralized than the pool number suggests).  
On the other hand, there could be one or two large mining entities concealing their hashpower by connecting to different pools (= less decentralized than the pool number suggests).

I think what causes confusion is the word "passphrase". A "passphrase" in this context is not something like a password you can lay over an existing wallet (like a PIN or something).  
A passphrase (adding a new word) does a similar thing as completely replacing all the words in the seed phrase - it creates a completely new wallet, wholly unrelated to the previous wallet. When you add a new word to your old phrase, it completely changes everything. It's as if the 24 words and the 24+new word are completely unrelated to each other.  
So by creating a new wallet on a Trezor with old 24 words but adding a 25th word deletes the old wallet and creates a totally new, empty one, which doesn't have any relation at all to the old wallet.  
Let's try to untangle what you wrote step by step:  


Yes, so far you have the exact same wallet on two different devices.  


Correct.  


This means you delete the previous wallet and create a new one (you cannot just add a passphrase to the existing wallet - you need to wipe the device and initialize it with the 25 words).  


Correct.  


Incorrect. The "new, passphrase protected wallet" has completely replaced the (24 word) wallet that was on the Trezor before, and doesn't have any relation to it.  


Correct.  


Correct (old wallet = Ledger one, 24 words, still has the 2 btc in it). The new wallet on Trezor is empty and is now a completely different wallet. 


Yes, after you sent one 1btc to the new wallet on Trezor (with the 25 words), both contain 1btc each.  


Correct. It doesn't matter which device you enter the 24 words into.  


It also doesn't matter which device you enter the 25 words into. In both cases, when entering the seedphrase, the previous seedphrase gets deleted and you get access to the balance associated with the newly entered seedphrase.  
In your case, you have 1 bitcoin (let's called bitcoin A) on the 24 word seed phrase. And you have 1 bitcoin (bitcoin B) on the 25 word seed phrase. Which the 24 word phrase, you only have access to bitcoin A (regardless if you enter this phrase on Ledger or Trezor or a whole another device).  
With the 25 word phrase you only have access to bitcoin B (regardless if you enter this phrase on Ledger or Trezor or a whole another device).  
------------ 
To express it really simply: re-initializing the Trezor by taking 24 old words (from Ledger) and adding a 25th word, is essentially the same as re-initializing the Trezor with 24 completely new words. In both cases it creates a whole new wallet, unrelated to the previous wallet.

"Valuable to the community" is a misunderstanding. Probably it's a left-over of the era where bitcoin nodes were only a dozen or a few hundreds. Nowadays, with ~10k listening nodes (= nodes which a new node can download historical blocks from) and ~100k non-listening nodes it's not so much of a concern.  
The most important purpose of a node is to serve you, the node maintainer, for trustless verification of your incoming transactions and to protect your privacy. Having a listening node (port 8333 open) is a nice, small bonus, but it's absolutely not necessary.  
That said, it's crucial for the health of the network in general that people run their own nodes.  
If I understand your question right, you want to run a node on someone else's server. The question here is: do you want to trust this server not to meddle with the node functionality, stay online whenever you need, not to track your usage, violate your privacy, track your bitcoin transactions and so on?  
With a node at home, on your own hardware, you don't need to worry about all that.

@_date: 2019-08-27 13:49:23


Yeah, that's the tricky part, and as long as HW integration is not yet implemented in Bitcoin Core itself, you need a workaround for that :/  
Basically you need to install Electrum Personal Server on your node, then run Electrum on your desktop/laptop, and then you can connect your hardware wallet to Electrum. So hardware wallet -&gt; your node is possible. Most other mobile wallets do not allow that though, afaik.  


Afaik there is a command in Bitcoin Core client for that, but it requires an indexed node. You even can build your own blockexplorer on your node, there was at least one open source project for that, but I cannot recall it's name at the moment.  
edit: might be this one: 
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:16:41
Since there are different open source teams working on it, there is no central source of information or road maps etc. The quickest/most direct sources are the github repositories themselves (with pull requests, issues, discussions) as well as the slack for LND (and Gitter for Eclair) with dev/users discussions.. And the respective Twitter accs :)  
Basically, there are three implementations of the Lightning Network, and those are: LND, Eclair, c-lightning. Then there are services (like wallets, games etc) who are integrating one of these three implementations. You can do research on those to see how they are doing, follow the devs on Twitter etc.

The largest difference are in creation of the private key in the first place (it's easy to fuck up if you do it manually and easy to leak if you do it on your own computer), as well as usage (it's impossible to transact **from** your paper wallet without putting it online, and it also reuses addresses for incoming transactions, which sucks for your privacy).
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:51:08


I just now realize that you are running a node on your own. So I assume you don't use the mobile version of Eclair, but desktop? If yes, I am actually not familiar with their client. I only know that their mobile version has private channels by default and (afaik) no settings to change that. Not sure how it is with the desktop version.  
You might want to join their Gitter channel, the devs are hanging out there + a lot of experienced users:  (it's also linked in their own Github repository, in case you don't want to trust a random link on reddit:

It's what commonly called "wrapped segwit". "Real" (native) segwit addresses start with "bc1q...", but many older wallets don't recognize this address format yet. In order to keep compatibility, the "3" addresses are something like a compromise.  
It's more of a semantic thing if one wants to call it legacy, or segwit, or wrapped segwit or whatever. Nothing to worry about in any case (but worth keeping in mind that some wallets don't recognize "bc1" address format yet).

Not for small purchases, but they plan to introduce KYC for larger ones. The merchants/businesses seem to be KYC'ed though:   
Furthermore, they are working with chain surveillance companies (not sure if they use Chainalysis, Elliptic or something else), which spy on your bitcoin transactions, even if they don't have KYC data.

Hmm, I'm not sure I understand your question correctly.  
Just to avoid misunderstandings: you can mine blocks without any transactions in them at all. You'd still get the block subsidy (currently 12.5 btc). Block mining doesn't depend on transactions. A new block would be mined every ten minutes on average, even if there are no transactions on the network at all.  
Which resources to recommend really depends on your level of understanding and level of motivation how deep you want to dive in. Andreas Antonopoulos usually has a good way to explain things in a beginner-friendly manner: 
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:39:13
Don't :)  
You have 24 words created by a Ledger = wallet A. You can import this wallet to any other hardware wallet (Trezor, f.ex).  
Now, if you create a new wallet on Trezor, and you take these 24 words and add a passphrase (25th word), you create a whole new wallet (wallet B). This new wallet is not associated with the previous Ledger wallet. The 25th word changes the private key completely.  
This new 24+1 wallet (wallet B) is not "locked" to Trezor though (even if you created it with Trezor). You can import it to Ledger as well (afaik). But keep in mind the original 24 words wallet (wallet A) and the new 24+1 wallet (wallet B) **are two completely different wallets**.  
Does this make sense?  
edit: I guess the basic thing that needs to be understood here is that any word that you add (or substract) from the seed phrase results in a completely different wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:09:02
Nice! Just curious: did you help the merchants to set up BTCPayserver (or something else), or did they figure it on their own?

Might be different reasons: to limit their internet traffic, or just not caring to open the port (nothing wrong with that), or not knowing how, or to stay little more private.  
P.S.: I think your link in the OP also doesn't count nodes running through Tor.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:07:57
You literally just connect it to your power outlet and point it to a mining pool over the internet. You personally don't need a node for that.  
But again, the pool operator probably (hopefully) runs a full node on their end.
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:55:19
Unfortunately, I don't know if Trezor allows you to store two different wallets simultaneously. AFAIK(!), if you enter a new seed phrase (which a seed phrase + passphrase essentially is), it wipes the old wallet and replaces it with the entered seed + passphrase (which is again, a completely different wallet than just entering the seed). But I might as well be wrong here.  
So perhaps it's better to ask on the Trezor's sub:  or contact them directly (through website).
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:20:35
They don't count non-listening nodes (nodes which don't have port 8333 open) and also don't count Tor nodes, afaik.

How do you envision this to function? I mean sure, having large quantities of bitcoin can affect its price if you dump all at once in a market order, but it doesn't destroy bitcoin. And any price manipulation has to come to an end sooner or later. You cannot go against the market infinitely.

It's absolutely not. It's just after years of arguing (I think the debate has been led since 5-6 years, culminating in the SW2X/UASF events) and every single argument being chewed through endlessly, people are kinda tired and wary to discuss it and trolling/downvotes come in easily.  
That said, if someone is genuinely curious and open to a debate, there are almost always people who are willing to explain and discuss things (especially in beginner context).  
But yeah, don't expect positive reactions if someone just comes in and screams "we need to increase the blocksize NOW!" ;)

No, it doesn't have anything to do with speed. It has to do with increased privacy and removing the need to trust third parties (miners, blockexplorers, your wallet's nodes and so on).

You got it (partially) wrong. There are three implementations of the Lightning Network Protocol: LND (maintained by Lightning Labs, but open-sourced and freely available), Eclair (by Acinq, open-sourced) and c-lightning (by Blockstream, also open-sourced afaik).  
So Lightning Labs is not *the* "lightning network developer", but one of the companies that are building a lightning network implementation. Important difference.  
Also there are more companies which accept Lightning payments, like Bitrefill, TorGuard, LudvigArt, Bitcoinshirt.co, Coincards etc.

They're both (most likely) wrong, as the hashrate fluctuates somewhat, meaning that the exact halving point as measured in human time fluctuates as well.  
The time of halving is fixed in bitcoin blocks, but it's impossible to predict precisely when the block will be mined in human time. As we'll get closer to the date, the estimates will be more precise though.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:31:32
It's not the wallets fault. They work with third party open source wallets (f.ex Electrum) without any problems. It's just a tricky thing to integrate with the Bitcoin Core client itself. It's currently being worked on in the bitcoin repository, and afaik there is already hardware wallet integration on the command line level, but not on the GUI (graphic user interface) level. Which will take a while, but it'll get there sooner or later.  
I'm not sure what the hardware wallets can do on their side in this case (at least those that I mentioned... They already offer connection to other wallet software).

It depends on the amount of bitcoin you hold and how secure you want them to be.  
Having your wallet/private key on an online device has always a non-zero risk of being hacked or stolen. A hardware wallet stores the key offline (the chip, where it is stored, never lets the key get online... it signs the transactions right there on the chip). Which makes it much harder to hack (even impossible without physical access to the device).  
As always, the user is the weakest link though... So a hardware wallet doesn't protect against all possible user failures ;)
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:05:13
Practice backup and restoring your wallet. The steps are described in the manuals (or various online guides, videos etc).  
Basically, you are given a set of 24 words when initializing your wallet for the first time. Write them down (on paper! **do not store them online**). This is your backup, it is independent of the particular hardware device. The device can break, or get lost, and you still can import these 24 words onto another device (even a completely different one, from a different manufacturer) and still have your bitcoin.  
Now, to practice: setup your hardware wallet, write down the 24 words. Send some small amount of bitcoin to your new wallet. Delete the wallet (f.ex with Ledger you just need to put in the PIN wrong three times, it deletes itself). Re-import the 24 words and see if your bitcoin is still there. If you got everything right and understood how it works, transfer the rest from your exchange account to your hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-26 16:25:48
The issue with Electrum is that by default it connects to random servers, and allows these servers to send messages to the user (not sure if that is fixed now in newer versions?). If the server is malicious, it can send a link to the user, disguised as an "update". Note that by itself the message and the link cannot do any harm, only installing the linked software and *actually using it for your bitcoin transactions* is dangerous.  
Ledger Live connects to Ledger's own nodes (this is a huge disadvantage regarding privacy, btw). So this particular attack is not a problem.  
The privacy concerns are more of a problem though (it's the same with Trezor and any other wallet that is not connected to your own node, to be fair). Best way to circumvent all of that is to run your own node and connect your hardware wallet to it. This is a bit of a clunky setup, but it's worth it imo. You need your own full node, Electrum, and Electrum Personal Server.  
So instead of Ledger Live, you connect your hardware wallet to Electrum. Which doesn't connect to random servers/nodes, but to your own node (this is what Electrum Personal Server is for).

You don't sign a wallet. You sign a transaction.  
Briefly explained: in order to construct a valid transaction, you (or your wallet, to be precise) need to sign the transaction with your private key. The private key is the "holy grail" that gives access to your bitcoin. This means, it should be kept as secure as possible - preferably offline.  
So if you need to sign a transaction and don't want to put your private key online, you can take the transaction and sign it offline (on an offline device), and then broadcast it onto the bitcoin network.  
There are various methods to do that. Theoretically, you even can do so by hand, but it's quite complicated and only recommended for learning purposes. Otherwise, keeping the private key on an offline machine and getting it to sign transactions is how it generally works (and that's also how hardware work basically - they keep the private key on an offline chip and "bring in" transactions to that chip in order for the private key to do the signing thing).

First of all: my condolences.  
Secondly: don't panic, there is no need to hurry. Either there is some bitcoin left and you can access it, or there isn't. Take your time to understand what you have on your hands. It won't run away in any case, so feel absolutely free to take everything as slow as you want, or to come back to it at some later point.  
How do you know that all accounts are at zero balance? Were you able to get access to the wallet(s)? Was there more than one wallet? Can you share the name of the wallet software (don't worry, this is not sensitive information)?  
Did you by any chance find any list of 12 or 24 words (that look absolutely random) somewhere? If yes, this is something that is commonly called a "seed phrase", or "backup phrase", or "private key". It could potentially give you access to a wallet that is not installed (or hidden) on your husband's computer (**this is sensitive information, do not give these words to anyone**).  
You also might want to look through your husband's old computers, hard drives, SD cards etc for these words (or anything else that looks like a bitcoin wallet).  
Also, perhaps you have any computer-savy member of your family, one that you trust a lot (this is important!) and who could help you dig through this stuff?

You can report such losses only if you realize them, which means trading coin B for another coin or into fiat. As long as you hold it, you don't get to claim any losses (also works other way: if it rises in value, you don't need to pay tax on it, as long as you hold it)

AFAIK(!) the node prunes away as it downloads/verifies. So you indeed download/verify the whole chain, but it never occupies the whole 270gb of space.  
I've never done it myself so that's only as my understanding goes.  
Also keep in mind that pruning disables certain (more advanced) usecases for a node (it won't able to use `txindex` f.ex)

You might misunderstand how bitcoin works. Broadcasting and sending transactions barely uses any computational resources. Validating the blockchain uses some resources, but it's still very limited (you can run a validating node on an old laptop and not notice any fluctuation on your electricity bill), although the bandwidth could be strained on very low internet connections.  
Mining requires a lot of electricity, but mining and number of transaction don't have any correlation (or at least not directly). For mining it doesn't matter if there is only one transaction per day or millions (although miners of course would prefer the latter). Besides, mining is a very specialized activity and not required to do on your own when you just want to send/receive bitcoin.

Well, if it's the safest, I don't know (what advantages do you expect by destroying the wallet?), but it's definitely possible. The seed phrase is what "backs up" your bitcoin and it's not bound to a specific wallet/hardware. So as long as you have access to the seed phrase, you're ok (but keep in mind you still need to import it into some wallet, when you want to receive new bitcoin or send from your existing stash).

So there was an outgoing transaction on a blockexplorer from one of your addresses, but this transaction is not visible (hasn't happened) on the device itself?  
This sounds like it shouldn't be possible, so perhaps there is something wrong with the blockexplorer, or perhaps you misread something on the blockexplorer (was it the correct address, correct blockchain etc)?

I think it probably depends if one defines volume=number of tx, or volume=amount of $.  
I don't have the data at hand, but if it's the former, PP must obviously be far bigger. For the latter, I wouldn't be so sure. As Nic Carter pointed out in his talk last year at the Baltic Honeybadger, bitcoins average transaction in USD is something like $3k/tx:.

Don't use paper wallets. Use a hardware wallet ($60-$100, but much more secure), or a decent desktop/smartphone wallet (free but less secure in general).  
Simply sending bitcoin to your own wallet is better than leave it on an exchange (because an exchange can refuse your transaction at any time, or they might get hacked etc). But it doesn't help a lot with privacy.  
To increase your privacy, you need to acquire some understanding how the bitcoin network works, apply some practices and use some mixing mechanisms (like Wasabi).

Transaction verification is not the primary purpose of mining. You can mine a transaction without verifying it (if the transaction is not valid, it will be rejected by the rest of the network though).  
Miners add blocks to the existing blockchain.  
OP, you are confusing miners with nodes. A miner might run a node or might not. A node if for verifying transactions (and for better privacy when transacting bitcoin). Mining is a very specific function, that most nodes don't perform nowadays. Mining is done on specialized, expensive hardware, while a node can be run on an old laptop, mini computer like a raspberry pi or even an android phone (with some tinkering).

You need a specialized hardware, called ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Set it up, turn it on and point it to a mining pool. But the pool operator is most likely to run a full node, because it ensures that the transactions/blocks that you mine are valid. Because if you accidentally include an invalid transaction in your block, it gets rejected by the network and you end up wasting a lot of money.

You have somewhat of a point, but not in this case. If neither the merchant nor the customer is subject to KYC laws, just by using Opennode (or whatever KYC compliant middleman there is), they suddenly have to comply with KYC requirements. Only because Opennode has to.

Yeah, everything is a trade-off in bitcoin :) especially increased complexity.  
I forgot another point though: potentially you also have better privacy with multiple devices, because you don't flash your entire balance to one backend, and you can use different sources of bitcoin for different wallets, without combining outputs (f.ex one wallet is for bitcoin from KYC compliant exchanges only, the other is for more private sources etc).

I would agree with this probability distribution :)  
But the scenario of "everyone uses just one single bitcoin" is so far ahead in the future (if at all possible), that I would assume that all easily recoverable/findable seeds would have been recovered/found by then, and the remaining chances are very close to zero.

To be fair, I'm talking not only about Ledger's nodes. It's a general issue with connecting to someone else's node, so it's the same with Trezor, any smartphone wallet etc.  
The issue is that your wallet needs to contact their nodes to ask for the balance of your wallet. The wallet asks for the balance of every receiving address. So the node can learn which addresses belong to one wallet. So even though you use a new receiving address every time, and outstanding observers cannot know the full amount of bitcoin you hold (because they only see different addresses and don't know which of them belong to one wallet), the node your wallet connects to has a way of figuring it all out.  
Now I'm not saying they do track all that, but they have all the power to do so. You have to implicitly trust that they don't (and we should have learned our lessons by now how companies treat our privacy...).  
But why trust, if you can simply run your own node and avoid this pitfall?  


To use your (hardware) wallet with your own node, it needs to be a full node (but you can prune it, if you are low on storage space, and you can do other adjustments to the configuration, if you want to save bandwidth etc).    
One guide I continue to recommend is this here:  It looks very extensive at a first glance, but it describes every step, and you simply need to copypaste commands most of the time. Unfortunately, such a setup is currently necessary in order to have your hardware wallet connected to your own node. I hope soon it will be much easier, when Bitcoin Core (the node client) allows for direct hardware wallet integration.  


Most welcome :)

Basically yes, if you never intend to send or receive bitcoin, a hardware wallet is not necessary.. But even if you plan to receive a few transactions, it is better with a HW because paper wallets and similar methods reuse addresses.  
Also, the private key generation is much safer (and convenient) with a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:24:30
Well, you need to use Ledger's (or Trezors) default wallet/software for the shitcoins, and I am not sure if by default this software also transmits your bitcoin addresses to their servers. If it does, then yes, you (partially) negate the privacy benefits of connecting the hardware wallet to your own node (you still keep the benefits of verifying your transactions on your own).  
If it doesn't transmit bitcoin addresses, and only leaks your shitcoin balance to Ledger's/Trezor's backend, I guess it's fine.

Bitcoin (capital B) is mostly used for referring to the network as a whole. bitcoin (lower b) is used to refer to the currency/coins itself.

Also, mining pools consists of a variety of individual miners and they can withdraw their hashpower from the pool at any given time (if the pool operator starts to misbehave, f.ex).  
Nevertheless, with current mining protocols pool operators still have quite a bit of power over mining (which tx's to mine f.ex), that's why it's important to adapt proposals such as [BetterHash](

It's trivially simple to spin up a large amount of nodes, and a chain is not "backed" by them in any technical way.  
And if you have a node that is not connected to your wallet and has no economic activity going through it (any kind of receiving transaction), it doesn't matter at all in such a scenario.  
A node is something that protects you in this scenario, because you don't have to trust third parties to tell you what the right chain version is. But you need to actually have it connected to your wallet to verify your own transactions/UTXOs. Simply spinning up a node and let it sit there won't do anything for neither side of the split.  
Basically what I'm trying to say is: in a contentious split scenario the number of (economically active) nodes might be an indicator for where the space as a whole stands, but the actual % on each side don't really matter. There is no 51% attack or anything like that for nodes.

I don't know the specific circumstances of Zebpay (if it's urgent or not), but I would avoid blockchain,info and cash out straight to a hardware wallet. If it's urgent indeed, perhaps consider a wallet like Samourai (Android) or Electrum (desktop).  
Before you do anything, make sure that you understand how backing up your private keys works (24 words) and perhaps try sending small amounts first in order to understand how transactions work etc!

I still would content your edit: 


"Helping the network" is the least important purpose of a full node. It's supposed to help yourself first. The network doesn't "need" it.  
Edit: you might be right if you explicitly want to run a Lightning routing node, but for a bitcoin full node there's definitely no requirement to keep it online 24/7 (although sure, it makes it more convenient in order not to sync up every time).

"Supporting the network" is mostly a misunderstanding. You don't really do much for the network if you don't use your node.  
Benefits are: validation of your own transactions without trust to any third parties, and avoiding leaking sensitive information (your bitcoin balances) to third parties. Also, having a better/safer choice in case of contentious forks.

@_date: 2019-08-21 11:15:26


Bluntly said: no  
There is more subtlety to it though. Bitcoin is not a hierarchical, power-centered system like the current fiat system (centered around central banks). It takes away decision making power from central authorities and distributes these powers between all the participants of the bitcoin protocol. No one can print more money (thus dilluting the value of the existing money), or take funds from others by force (assuming the funds are stored securely... of course there is always a threat of hacking and robbery). Also, no one can prohibit you from participating in the bitcoin network (as opposed to the banking system, where you need to ask for permission from banks and other authorities).    
In this regard, bitcoin equalizes the power distribution in the system. It does not (and cannot) ensure any kind of income equality though.
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:34:33
It talks about nodes downloading/storing the blockchain, but not about the most important part: actually **validating** it, which makes a full node a tool to trustlessly transact on the bitcoin network.

@_date: 2019-08-03 18:19:59
1. Correct  
2. If mining becomes unprofitable, some miners drop out and the mining difficulty adjusts down after a period of time, making mining easier/more profitable again, thus attracting new miners to come in (google "bitcoin difficulty adjustment").  
3. If everybody stopped mining, the network would come to a halt, yes. But then it would be like picking up free money on the street for anyone who starts mining, so **someone** will be mining again.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:01:26
The current transfer volume doesn't have much to do with energy usage. The volume can go up 10x tomorrow, and the energy usage could stay the same (or vice versa).  
The energy usage has a certain purpose: it makes the network really really hard to attack. It also makes it hard to switch off: as long as miners have economic incentives to mine, *someone somewhere* will keep on mining.  
It's kinda like saying "Switzerland uses more energy than Liechtenstein. Will Switzerland be replaced by a more efficient country?" :)  
I also invite you to look at the FAQ of the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (by University Of Cambridge), which probably answers a few questions in energy consumption, environmental impact, purpose of the electricity usage in PoW and so on:

Listening by default afaik, but usually you have to open this port on your home router (which a lot of people don't know how to do or just don't bother to).  


Not really. The most important purposes of the node (validating the transactions of the user + maintaining their privacy) doesn't depend on the node having port 8333 open or not.  
That said:  
* a listening node is easier discoverable on sites like in the OP - this is trivially prevented by setting up Tor on your node though. I have mine on Tor and it doesn't appear on sites like this and doesn't announce its IP to its peers.  
* opening port 8333 makes it possible for new nodes to download historical blocks from you, which has an impact on your nodes' bandwidth usage. This is also trivially solved by putting limitations in the *.config file on the number of peers that can connect to you and other limitations on bandwidth.  
So as you see, you can run a listening node without implications for your privacy and bandwidth. But if you run a non-listening node, it's perfectly fine, too. In this regard it is different than having a torrent seed up: a node on the bitcoin network is supposed to serve its user, not other people in the first place.

This is misinformation. Your uptime can be as patchy as you want, it'll just take more time to re-sync if you going offline for a while. But there's absolutely no harm in that. As long as you don't need your node be available 24/7 (for merchant transactions or something critical), it's absolutely fine to leave it offline for period of times.

By "crisis" I assume you mean "financial crisis".  
I don't doubt it might have an effect on the price (people fleeing from any assets into cash), but it won't kill bitcoin. Price crashes don't have the power to kill a protocol.  
Besides, bitcoin is probably the least leveraged financial asset out there, so in a financial crisis it might suffer not even that big of a price drop (but even if it drops 90% in price it'll survive - as it survived similar drops in the past already).

@_date: 2018-06-20 22:17:12


Yes, can't argue against that :) but I also think it's how popular communities work on contentious topics in general, and there are a bunch of trolls (on both sides) or very loud, rather hateful users which colour the perception accordingly. It's mostly just like two rivaling sports teams: each side loves to talk trash about the other team, but in real life only a small minority of each group would actually behave hatefully towards a member of the opposite group.  
In this particular case such behaviour is even more amplified due to the anonymity and the general way how very large online communities are prone to attracting trollish, "loud" personalities.  
edit: I cannot argue against the point that bitcoin space is perceived as toxic and hostile by onlookers from outside... But this is a feature imo, not a bug. In a way, such "toxic" behaviour is also needed to call out scams (or what is perceived as scam), to drive out bad players, and in some way, it's necessary in such an heterogenous, anarchistic pool of opinions, preferences and goals. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:27:25


This is not an inherent feature, rather early stages of an immature system (which barely entered the beta phase).  


Same here, but you can't compare a trust-based, custodial solution (exchange) with a trustless, non-custodial one (Lightning). Two completely different pair of shoes.   


Oh, they of course don't "steal" it, but ask some Cypriots or Greeks or Indians or Argentinians what their banks did ;)

What specifically do you mean by this? Using space on bitcoin's blockchain has non-zero costs and externalizes those costs on the person transacting (fees) and on the maintainers of nodes (because every transaction has to be propagated, validated and stored forever on the blockchain). So putting any substantial amount of non transactional data on the blockchain is a bad (and expensive) idea.  
It's great and useful to timestamp files (hashes of files) f.ex though. But I'm not sure how useful it might be for gaming industry. Perhaps it might for certain types of usecases.

But if the new blocks are correct and have the most hashpower/the longest chain, this would mean that the old blocks are valid/correct, right? Although in this case you implicitly trust a) the miners and b) the ecospace as a whole (it would have sounded a shrill alarm if the chain with the most hashpower was suddenly incorrect).

You mean... they hodl? What do you think will happen to the price and perception of bitcoin, when a state or another major actor becomes a bitcoin hodler? :)  
Sure, I wouldn't not like it if a state would suddenly possess something like 50% of bitcoin's circulating supply, but I don't think it would cause system-critical issues (besides that this would be unrealistic anyway), imo. Especially if they really plan to hold it and not market dump.

To compensate for lack of fees and to distribute new bitcoins into the system, there is something called "block subsidy" - a fixed amount of bitcoin given to the miner finding a block. Currently this amount is 12.5 bitcoin, and it halves every four years. So in the beginning there was 50 btc block subsidy, four years later it was 25 btc, now it's 12.5 and next year it is going to halve to 6.25 btc, and so on.

Beyond other reasons (pools don't have ultimate control over all the hashpower they are pooling): it just pays more for miners to behave according to rules, that's inherent in the design of bitcoin.  
But yes, if you have a completely irrational actor (or an actor motivated by non-economical or indirect results), hashpower concentration is undesirable.

There is ongoing work to integrate hardware wallets with Bitcoin Core directly. No idea what the current state of progress is, but it will get there sooner or later.  
In the meantime, you need a bit of a clunky workaround to connect your hardware wallet to Bitcoin Core: you need  [Electrum Personal Server]( which you connect to your Bitcoin Core node. Then you can choose your own node as a server in the Electrum wallet. And you then open your hardware wallet with Electrum (instead of the default software like Ledger Live).

As with every third party, you have to trust whomever runs the tipping bot to pay you out. It's not a trustless solution (as opposed to your own wallet, where you hold your private keys on your own).

This is absolutely incorrect, sorry. The 51% number is only relevant when you (= a group of miners) attempts to introduce a different version of transaction history, which is necessary if you try to doublespend your transactions. One theoretical example of a doublespend fraud: you send coins to an exchange, sell them for USD (or other currency), withdraw your funds, get the 51% of miners to introduce another version of the transaction history where the exchange deposit transaction never happened -&gt; profit (keep in mind this is a theoretical attack, in practice it's close to impossible due to variety of reasons).  
The 51% number is in itself absolutely meaningless for consensus (edit: maybe I shouldn't say "absolutely", it still can be a good metric in certain cases, but generally it's just that - a metric). It is also meaningless in regards to nodes - it has nothing to do with democracy.  
I guess consensus can be broadly described as something that is **emerging** (from the rule set that users choose to apply), rather than something that is **achieved**. But it's kinda generic statement and depends on in which context we are talking about consensus.

Well, they provide the convenience of having your private key offline but still being to transact with it at any time.  
If you only have your private key offline (on paper or other storage method), you cannot transact with it without putting it on an online machine (thus increasing your risk). A hardware wallet is the solution to that.

Yes, but it verifies the new blocks, and if the new blocks are valid and have the highest hashpower, it can be inferred that the older blocks are valid, too (since they are cryptographically linked), no?  
Again, under the assumption that there would have been an alarm if the highest hashpower is doing something "wrong".

Mostly yes (as a rough guideline). The storage space is a little more than 200gb for now, so plan accordingly.  


It's not a problem if your network is somewhat patchy, the sync might just take more time but that's all. More important is that you haven't an expensive, metered connection, as you going to download &gt;200gb of data (and also upload some, at least if you open port 8333).  


Should be all right (depends on the laptop though of course). But people (incl) me are running full nodes on raspberry pi's just fine, and most old laptops are much more powerful than a raspberry pi.
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:29:21


It depends on the third party :p  
Every bitcoin that you buy is from a "third party". What it depends on is:  
- is this party reliable (a trustworthy person/exchange/business)?  
- do they send or let you withdraw bitcoin to your own wallet (of which you alone control the private key)?  
While I guess RobinHood is a somewhat reputable company and you can answer the first question with "yes", they don't let you withdraw your bitcoin. Which essentially means, you don't get any bitcoin with them. You just can place a bet on bitcoin's price. But you don't hold any actual bitcoin.  
Important to understand the difference ;)

There are already countless forks of the repo (f.ex, when you want to work on a pull request, you need to fork the repo anyway). Don't confuse it with a chain fork, where you create an altcoin :)  Forking the github repository is a very different thing with a same name.

It's possible to change the rules of your full node in whatever way you like, even so that it allows an increase in supply, but don't expect everyone on the network to follow your rule changes ;) You'll just going to find yourself on a minority fork of the chain.

We are talking about some very serious (and improbable) scenario here, if we're down to 500 (listening) nodes here and someone spinning up "malicious" nodes, so of course I will care :)  
But I don't see how the amount of malicious (= non compatible) nodes will matter here as a number, especially if their blocks are being mined by just one miner (I assume one miner implies a tiny fraction of the overall sha256 hashrate).

The basic principle is this: any website, any repository where the code is stored and being worked on, is obviously under someone's control. But the code itself is visible and free to use by anyone, so if you don't like what happens in a particular repository, you just take the code and continue to develop it by yourself (or with other people). You can also use it in whichever way you like.  
Just think of it as a text file. If I put the text file on my website, I of course control what I do with that file (how I present it, how I format it etc). But you and anyone else can simply copy all the contents of that text file at any time and do whatever you want with it.

I don't think it's a malware.  
What I also don't understand: so from this address (starting with `34`) you also made an outgoing transaction yesterday (when you were concerned about malware), right? If so, it also doesn't show on the blockexplorer?  
Please let me know what the ledger guys say, I'm curious now :)  
Unrelated, but since you seem privacy conscious (which is a great thing btw): by putting in your transactions into a blockexplorer, you are linking your IP address to your bitcoin addresses. Don't use blockexplorer, of if you really need to, download and use Tor browser with a blockexplorer. I also would recommend blockstream,info as an explorer, as they claim not to track data, and I am inclined to believe them more than blockchain,com. But I would not trust either.  
Second, if you don't run your full node, your Nano has to contact ledger's nodes/servers and ask them for address balances every time you open the Ledger Live software.  
This is also a privacy leak and is fixed by running your own full node (and connecting your hardware wallet to it, instead of ledger live software).  
Unfortunately, this requires a little tinkering and is not super intuitive. Here's a guide how to do this on a raspberry pi:  (you can disregard the Lightning part and just do the node part + hardware wallet connection).

Adding to that, fiat conversion is inherently imprecise, because different wallets use different sources to convert btc to usd. So one wallet might show $10200 for 1 bitcoin, and another wallet at the exact same time can show $10188. If there is some time inbetween, it's even more likely that the amounts will diverge.  
But yeah, most of the divergence will be caused by ATM fees. They're expensive (trade off for convenience and better privacy).

Yep.  
More precisely, they listen on port 8333 for incoming connections. If the port is closed (you can adjust this on your router), the node cannot "hear" anything, because the incoming connections simply cannot get through the closed port.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:18:46


Probably, but how would that work? Setting up a node is *somewhat* easy and why would anyone pay you for that, if they can setup a node on their own (or connect to already available nodes)?  
FWIW, lightning routing nodes are already collecting tiny fees when routing transactions.

- has fees  
- **it can do fractional reserve banking** (creating money out of thin air) . 
Lightning node:  
- doesn't hold your money (except if it's your own node, which grants you access only to *your own* money, not to your channel's partner)  
- fully permissionless (no KYC whatsoever)  
- if someone's node doesn't route your transaction, it gets routed around *instantaneously*   
- sub-cent transactions (sub-satoshis even)  
- instant  
- sub-cent fees (default right now is 1 satoshi per hop, which is something like $0.000061 right now - yes, a tiny fraction of a cent per one hop)  
- **no fractional reserve** (no credit)

Mining was removed from the client in the 0.13.0 version: 
 
  


I think for CPU's to become mineable again the difficulty has to adjust down so drastically that it doesn't even make sense to offer it in the client..

I'm not sure but I assume a pool operator would see the IPs of the connected miners. This is probably easily spoofed/circumvented (by using Tor, f.ex), and also if someone was really keen to hide their hashpower, they'd connect it over different IPs etc.

Mining and validating are two different things. Validating means checking if transactions/blocks are valid (properly signed with the according private key, not doublespending coins etc). This is a task of a full node (short for "fully verifying node").  
Mining means taking unconfirmed transactions and bundle them together into a block. When a new block is created by a miner, it propagates through the network, and full nodes check if the transactions within this block are valid (same process as described in the paragraph above).  
If everything is valid, the block gets attached to the blockchain. Every full node keeps a copy of the blockchain and attaches new blocks to it after verification.  
More clear now? :) Ask again if you don't get something.

Very briefly: for an update to get into the protocol, it needs to pass multiple "checks". First, there needs to be a pull request (or a discussion on the dev mailinglist and other public channels, if it is a more critical change). Everyone can contribute a pull request, there are no limitations/permissions on who can contribute.  
This pull request gets peer reviewed (on [GitHub]( where everyone interested can look at and criticize the change, and if the change passes review, it gets merged into the code base.  
But for this update to actually reach the user, the user has to **manually** install the update. This is important - the update process is manual and not automatic, so there are less chances for something malicious to get into the user's node. The user has the opportunity to review the code, or wait for reviews, or simply just not updating at all (since all updates are backwards compatible anyway).  
There are some additional checks and balances, such as verification of signatures (so you can be sure that the update you install is exactly the same as you see on the GitHub page).

Taking a long-term perspective on an investment is generally much, much less riskier than short-term trades and trying to time the market (assuming that the underlying fundamentals of the investment are solid in the first place).  
To your main question: usually you have a triad decision when buying bitcoin. Pick two: cheap - convenient - private. Exchanges are cheap and convenient, but not private at all. Cash in person is convenient and private, but not cheap usually. Etc.  
Which method you choose, depends on which trade offs you are willing to take and what country you are located at.

Sure (and also I'd add that it somewhat increases "privacy by numbers"), but with ~10k listening nodes and ~70k non-listening nodes we're long past that point where an additional node makes any kind of difference.  
A node is supposed to be used for verifying your own transactions (and to protect your privacy while looking up/broadcasting transactions). If it is not doing that, it's pretty much useless.  
But in any case, running a node 24/7 is not a requirement at all. This was my main point. People should not be discouraged from running their own node if they cannot leave it on 24/7.

I agree with the general gist of your post, but "decentralization" is not really a metric (and it wouldn't be the "only relevant" one in the first place - there's also immutability, permissionless, security, development, network effects and so on).  
Decentralization, if anything, is a spectrum, with difficult to define properties and difficult to measure metrics.

Anyway, I would say that he is indeed influential for people coming new into the space. If he suddenly starting spouting something like "BCH is Bitcoin", Lots of people would believe him.  
But those newcomers wouldn't be the people who run heir own nodes, hold meaningful amounts of bitcoin, have influential businesses in the space and so on. And apart from that, Andreas would get tons of flack immediately and get ostracised from the space pretty quickly (as would anyone else in that situation). So yeah, I don't think he holds lots of meaningful influence in this regard (although influential on opinion of newcomers).

I'm not familiar with docker so I don't know.  
The installation takes a few minutes max usually though, so I'm not sure what the problem here would be (perhaps I misunderstand the question)?  
If you want to avoid syncing the bitcoin blockchain from scratch (this is what takes a lot of time, not the installation itself), you can simply copypaste it onto the new machine, if you already have downloaded and synced the blockchain on another machine.

This is not true. Ledger, Trezor and Coldcard definitely allow to connect to your own node (although the setup involves a little tinkering... But not because they restrict it or anything). You need to connect your wallet to Electrum (instead of Ledger Live f.ex), and you can connect Electrum to your own node through Electrum Personal Server.

Either this way (it involves an extra transaction though, which costs additional tx fees), or you can create a new Electrum wallet with the same seed, but with wrapped SegWit addresses (those that start with "3"):    
Electrum -&gt; File -&gt; New/Restore -&gt; enter a name, click "next" -&gt; "standard wallet" -&gt; "I already have a seed" -&gt; enter your seed phrase -&gt; choose "BIP39 seed" under Options -&gt; next -&gt; choose P2SH-P2WPKH -&gt; let it sync and go to "receive" section.  
You should be able to see an address that starts with a "3" and it should work with Localbitcoins.  
Note that although you now have two Electrum wallets, they are both created from the same private key. You just need to open two different wallet files for the different address formats (one for the "3" addresses, and one for the "bc1" addresses).  
If in any doubt, try with small amounts first, and ask again if something's unclear.

If I remember correctly, there are a lot of separate *.dat files, each containing multiple blocks.  
I'm not sure how the actual download process goes, I think your node requests/download single blocks separately and verifies them, and then writes the .dat files on the disk. But I might be wrong here, so perhaps someone can confirm/deny.

Hardware wallet is a must. For higher privacy, you should connect it to your own full node (so it doesn't leak information/addresses to third parties).  
Coinjoin is a great practice, but it's not "one solution fits all". Both currently available software (Wasabi and Samourai *edit: and Joinmarket*) have their advantages and disadvantages. Best way to ensure privacy is to learn what [coincontrol](  is (basically, manual control of your UTXOs, not mixing KYC UTXOs with non-KYC ones) and practice it. As well as simply avoiding KYC sources (exchanges) as much as you can/want.   
There are a few nice privacy FAQs which can help you with further research:

Running a node = caring about yourself (privacy and ensuring that you are not being fed incorrect transaction data)  
The node network doesn't really rely on your altruism ;)  
edit: I would phrase it like this: it is not possible to communicate with the bitcoin protocol without running a full node. For a transaction to happen, *someone somewhere* needs to run a node and broadcast/verify the transaction on your behalf. This has implications for your privacy and for your trust model.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:16:46
Keep also in mind that the privacy factor is also achieved much better by running your own node and connecting your hardware wallet to it... This way you don't flash your balance to any third party at all (and no need to acquire multiple devices etc).
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:11:48
It's only half of that: ~250gb of space. But yeah, it's still a lot. You can use pruned mode though (your node will discard the blocks immediately after it downloaded and validated them), so you might be able to save the most amount of that space.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:45:25
But the denied transactions (which don't follow the new rules) will still be mined by the 49% of miners, (and accepted by all nodes of the network). So if one of the 49% miners finds a block, the attacking 51% needs to present a longer version of the chain (two blocks), in order to orphan the block by the 49% miner, and this will need to be the case consistently, no?  
I have no idea about the maths behind this, but wouldn't this type of attack require much more than controlling 51% of hashpower?

It should be visible in your wallet and not have any error messages :) 
Apart from that, you can make a test payment somewhere?  


The network consists of nodes which are connected through payment channels. You can either open a channel to a node directly and transfer satoshis instantly, or you can send to other nodes without having a direct channel with them. In this case, the satoshis get routed by other nodes.   
This is a very basic explanation, I'm not sure what exactly you would like to know... Perhaps try to describe what you don't understand specifically?
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:26:31
Only one: a listening node allows other nodes to download (historic) blocks from it (like a seed on a torrent network). So when a new node joins the network, it can look for listening nodes and request/download historic blocks from it.  
Note that serving blocks to others is not the node's primary purpose (this is where it's different from a seed on a torrent network). The primary purpose of a bitcoin node is to enable its owner verification of their bitcoin transactions without relying on a third party. Also, it provides the owner with a higher degree of privacy (otherwise, third party nodes can track your bitcoin transactions more easily).  
So there is no big difference in listening vs non-listening nodes (also listening nodes are easier to discover, that's why bitnodes and similar sites only list those nodes).
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:40:53


I'm not sure, I guess there is kinda a minimum amount because for tiny amounts the fees and efforts (setting up account/trades, paperwork etc) might be not worth it. But also depends on how much risk one is willing to take and so on.

If this was patented/closed source technology, it wouldn't have gained the bootstrapping traction it got in the first place. The whole point of bitcoin is to be a decentralized, permissionless, open source protocol.
@_date: 2019-10-29 10:52:32
You can start with two important questions:  
- who/what prevents the actors from entering wrong information (deliberately or accidentally) into the blockchain?  
- what incentives do participants have to keep up the security of that blockchain, and how do they protect it from various attacks?  
I think the first question is self-explanatory. I'll expand on the second one.  
Blockchain is simply another word for database. Calling a database "blockchain" does not make it immutable, distributed, trustless, decentralized, secure, open source, verifiable and whatnot. In order for it to be secure and immutable, you need strong economical incentives for someone to make it so (with bitcoin, it's the miners), and you need these incentives to be balanced in such a way that it **pays more to behave according to rules** instead of cheating or attacking the chain.  
In bitcoin, this is achieved through paying out block rewards and fees to miners. Miners are incentivized to increase their hashrate as much as possible, making it more and more difficult to attack for "dishonest" miners. Also, users keep miners in check: if miners start misbehaving, users will lose trust in the network and simply leave it, making miner's equipment and investments worthless.  
So who are the miners (keeping the network safe) and the users (giving value to miner's rewards and keeping miners in check) in your example? How difficult would it be to bootstrap such a network from scratch and have all the incentives aligned, have people keeping the code up-to-date in a distributed, decentralized manner and so on?  
The only thing I can think of is to simply use an already up and running blockchain which has proven to be secure - bitcoin. But then it's "bitcoin not blockchain". Also, writing data into bitcoin's blockchain comes at a cost (tx fees), and that cost also wildly varies over time.  
TL;DR:  
Creating a permissionless, trustless, decentralized database is hard/impossible, because it has real-world costs (for people who secure the blockchain and also for people validating/storing it) and those costs need to be evened out by economical incentives somehow. Perhaps money is the only area where such an incentive design is possible in the first place.
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:39:52


If the price of BTC is anywhere close to the area, there is something really bad happening to fiat money... Why should I trade something as valuable as bitcoin for fiat, if fiat lost value so rapidly?

How do you send a transaction from a paper wallet? The answer to that question is the answer to "why buy a hardware wallet" ;)  
A hardware wallet keeps your private key offline, but you still are able to send transactions to it (and generate new receiving addresses and so on). To transact from a paper wallet, you need to bring it online, which is a security risk.  
edit: the generation of the private key is also more convenient/safe with a HW in the first place.

How quickly your transaction is confirmed has to do with three things:  
1. how large the fees are (measured in sat/byte) that you attached to your transaction  
2. how many other unconfirmed transactions are currently "out there"  
3. how large the fees of those other unconfirmed transactions are  
4. how quick the blocks are found after you sent out your transaction (on average, each block takes 10 minutes, but due to variance one block can take 0-120 minutes or even longer)  
Mostly, this is a combination of all four. In any case, you don't have to worry: either your transaction will be confirmed at some point, or nothing leaves your wallet (or said differently: nothing leaves your wallet until the transaction is actually confirmed).

Node count by itself is an useless (and easy gameable) metric. What's important is that people **use** their nodes for validating their transactions, and that it stays relatively easy to spin up a new node.  
Mining adoption (hashpower?) is also important but this seems to take care of itself through economical incentives.
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:32:41
I haven't even noticed, good catch :)  
I don't think it's weird (although odds of that happening are quite low), since pools are comprised of small individual miners and it seems plausible that two different miners in a pool find a block at the same time. But tbh, I'm not so knowledgeable on the technical details.  
~~What seems more weird to me is that the screenshot shows two minutes difference in the time of the blocks (I would assume they'd be much closer together).~~ edit: I'm seeing things

Excellent question.  
It definitely matters, although it's debatable what the "right" ratio of nodes/users should be. I remember that u/luke-jr argued that 80% of users should run their own nodes for the network to be "healthy". Obviously, we are nowhere near that and I doubt that 80% will be realistic any time soon.  
However, most people would agree that the more nodes (used nodes! not simply nodes that hang around unused) - the better it is overall. If no users validate their transactions on their own, the network becomes susceptible to take over attempts by miners (or other entities, such as the SegWit2X attempt by various businesses and miners).  
F.ex, if you only look up your transactions on a blockexplorer, and the blockexplorer (and other blockexplorers/services) suddenly decides that "bitcoin cash is now bitcoin" (perhaps even without telling you about it), how do you protect yourself? Or if miners start mining incompatible blocks (without a cap, or with more than 21 million coin supply), you have to rely on blockexplorers to inform you that rules have been changed. And you cannot do anything about that, if you don't validate rules on your own.  
Another huge concern is privacy. If every user connects their wallet to the nodes of a centralized service (Ledger, Trezor, and any other wallet creator), it's much easier to surveil the UTXO movements and collect data on the users.
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:35:07

1) "taint" is largely a myth  
2) let's say you have coins that are associated with Silk Road. An observer (a chain analysis company, f.ex) can make a 100% certain connection from those coins to Silk Road.  
Now you mix these coins with 10 different people (or just 10 different bitcoin addresses, because addresses are pseudonymous and no one knows which address is controlled by which entity). Suddenly, an observer can only say with 10% certainty which outputs of that mix have been associated with Silk Road. Mix it once again, and the certainty goes down even more.  
There are some technical subtleties and it's possible to screw up your privacy in these mixes (by combining mixed outputs, especially with unmixed ones), but in general this is how coinjoin mixing works.  
Or let's say you don't mix at all, just making some regular bitcoin transactions. How many jumps (from one bitcoin address to another) in order for the connection to weaken/disappear? Not *that* many (again, I'm leaving out some technical subtleties, such as change addresses, combining outputs etc).  
Drawing this mixing and transacting game further, you'll see that almost every coin on the network will be "tainted" at some point, thus diffusing the meaning of it being "tainted" in the first place.  
There are without doubt some powerful analytic tools existing that can "follow" coins transactions, but they are also very limited in their usage, if the users know what they're doing and/or people just give more care to their privacy in general.

Nice. With EPS set up, you now can use your hardware wallet with your own node (through Electrum, which connects to EPS/your own node, instead of random nodes)! :)

That's not correct. You have solutions like [BTCPayserver]( which offers you the same method of invoicing the customer. The difference is that you don't have to rely on third parties: all the invoices get paid straight to your own wallet (where you own the private key). It's also fee-less, no KYC and completely open source. No intermediaries necessary :)  
The only thing BTCPayserver does not offer is automatic conversion of BTC to fiat (for that you'd need a regulated, banked company which again would mean KYC and intermediaries and so on). But apart from that it is vastly preferable to any third-party trusted service, imo.

You don't need to hardfork the blockchain if you want to get rid of the maintainers, or if GitHub misbehaves or anything like this.

FYI: charts like these (also bitnodes etc) count only listening nodes (which have port 8333 open). There are much more non-listening nodes out there (which don't allow block download by their peers). Luke's chart f.ex count ~70k bitcoin nodes overall:

@_date: 2019-08-26 21:38:10
A node is basically a software (running on either your computer or on a separate device, such as raspberry pi), which checks if bitcoin transactions (and the blocks containing those transactions) are valid. Valid means, the transaction have been signed with a private key, hasn't been doublespending coins and so on.  
In order to transact on the Lightning network, you have to do a bitcoin transaction (to open a channel). For this transaction to happen (as for every regular bitcoin transaction), you need a node. It might be your own node, or your wallet is connected to one, but without nodes there can't be a bitcoin network.  
Advantages in running a node yourself: higher degree of privacy (less possibilities to spy on you by companies or simply the wallet itself), independence of third parties for verifying transactions and being more safe in case of contentious hardforks.

It's probably counting only so-called "listening nodes" (those that have port 8333 open). The count of non-listening nodes is something like 70k-100k:   
The only difference between listening and non-listening nodes is: the former allow other (new) nodes to download historic blocks from them (acting similar to torrent seeds). Otherwise there's no difference in functionality.

Yes, if all the participants agree to change the rules, then everything is fine and dandy.  
In practice, such a contentious change won't fly and the best that miners (or willing nodes, or anyone wanting an increased supply) could hope for is to create a split-off coin and hope that it gains some substantial traction. Actually, that's exactly what we've seen with BCH, only that the changed variable was not the supply increase, but the blocksize increase. Same thing for your question though.

If by faucet you mean "for free", you'd still have to calculate your profits (in fiat value) at each trade. Most countries have yearly allowances though, so if you just made a few bucks through trading, it might be below this threshold. But it depends on the jurisdiction.  
Well, you are required to inform the authorities about your income and profits... If you follow the law or not, is your decision and your own risk as well.

I have no idea how to calculate this, but just to give a feel of how unimaginable vast the space for all possible private keys is (answered by Peter Wuille, [link](

Does the address start with "bc1..."? If so, localbitcoins probably hasn't upgraded their backend yet (it's a somewhat new address format) and you might need to create another receiving address with Electrum, which starts with "3" (or "1")

Mostly disagree. 
- for a token to acquire value and to be spendable for goods/services, there must be someone on the other end willing to **hold** that token. If the person accepts that token and immediately dumps it like a hot potato (or even worse, doesn't accept it in the first place but uses some intermediary like BitPay, getting fiat money), this doesn't do anything for the economy in the larger picture, except enriching intermediaries (exchanges, BitPay and similar payment middlemen). You absolutely need holder, people who are willing to hold the token for longer periods of time, in order for this token to be valuable.  
- I agree that better payment infrastructure for people who want to spend/accept bitcoin as payments is a good thing, especially when circumventing fee-taking, data-tracking middlemen. I consider [BTCPayserver]( one of the most important projects in the space.  
- don't tell people what to do with their bitcoin. Usecases are different, and I am personally into bitcoin exactly because no one can force me to do something with it (as opposed to inflationary systems, which basically force users to spend/invest)

Well, that's absolutely possible, I just don't see a lot of reason in it :)  
F.ex, what's the reasoning to destroy the hardware wallet? You are already trusting it to create a private key for you, so if you don't trust it, you should create a private key by other means (which are most likely to be faulty, if you're a beginner).  
P.S.: you actually can wipe the hardware wallet so it doesn't hold any private key at all, without physically destroying it.

A node is not a miner. A node is used to verify your own transaction (so you don't have to rely on your wallet's nodes/blockexplorers) and to avoid leaking of sensitive information (your wallet balance) to third parties.  
A miner has a different function (mining new blocks, "attaching" new transactions to bitcoin's blockchain).

Afaik it's 6.8%?

It depends what exactly you mean by "our governance structure"?  
The mentioned sites have each their own structure: most of them are open source and run by some kind of consensus (the github repo, bitcoincore.org, bitcoin.org), where anyone can contribute, open issues, pull requests etc.    
Others (twitter, reddit) are obviously based on centralized platforms obliging to their T&amp;C's (it wouldn't be a huge problem for reddit or twitter to simply kick the sub/account).  
If you mean the protocol development in general, it's open source and free to contribute to anyone. You might be interested in this article to get a better insight how this works:

Wrong focus, imo. "Blockchain" is just a database structure and is a completely meaningless concept when not combined with proof-of-work, cryptography, economical incentives (for miners) and open source development.

I would argue that if such a timeline starts to manifest itself, people would take more and more care of their coins, and other solutions (multisig, some kind of trustless custodial storage, vault proposal by Brian Bishop, things like that) will become more mature and easier to use. There is no way that if we're half through in such a timeline, people would treat their satoshis the same way as they treat them today, imo.  
The more valuable they become, the more people are incentivized to put more effort in protecting them. And the better solutions there are for storing them right.

I don't know why you have come to this conclusion. Bitcoin is stronger than ever and the big blocker faction has their toy to play around with. If you are talking about the divisiveness between the two groups: my feeling is that it is vastly overdramatized by the online communities and people who love to write about this and the whole "holy war" thing.  
Anyway, I don't see anything that is lost. It's another test for bitcoin and by far not the last one, most important one or even the most challenging one.

Mostly by having much less centralized points of failure, and having a much more censorship-resistant, permissionless, borderless nature of the protocol.

But thank you for the tip, much appreciated :)
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:31:06
No. You need a full node to communicate with bitcoin's network. Your wallet is connected to someone's full node and it asks the full node every time you receive a transaction.  
This means, you have to trust that their full node gives you the correct information. You also leak sensitive information (your balance) to that node (it might be run by chain analytic companies, for all you know).  
Having your own full node avoids all these pitfalls. It also protects you from trusting third parties in case of contentious chain splits and so on.  
You can run your node on an old laptop, even a smartphone (with some restrictions), or on a cheap, dedicated hardware (like a raspberry pi), so it doesn't interfere with your computer activity and can be run 24/7.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:51:19
Yeah I know the struggle with all that stuff. It's frustrating at times when you go a bit more advanced and don't have a lot of experience.  


AFAIK(!), it's not possible to connect Samourai remotely to your own node, at least without using their Dojo software (I'm not sure if it's out yet for regular users). Besides that (again AFAIK), even when it is connected, Samourai uses your node only for broadcasting transactions (which is good for your privacy, as you don't use Samourai's backend this way), not for actually verifying the transactions. The Dojo software is supposed to improve that though.  
At least that's how I understand it, which might be wrong.

Have you bothered to click on the article link? It answers exactly these questions in depth.
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:19:14
You can use a node and a wallet separately. You can even use your hardware wallet and connect it to the node (for transaction verification and better privacy).  
This means, even if your node crashed/ddosed/goes up in flames your coins are all well and safe on your hardware wallet :)

I don't think this is the case, tbh. It would be a slippery slope to walk on, too - what is the community? How does one measure what it wants in a fair manner? What if "it" (or parts of it) demands something stupid?  
I mean, sure, devs have users in mind but they generally do stuff because they enjoy doing it, or think that it's important.. Not because "the community" demands it. I'm generalizing here ("devs" is not at all a homogenous group of people with same views), and it's only my subjective observation, so might be wrong, of course.

Primarily it's better for privacy. By reusing addresses you tell the public how many donations your received, f.ex (because all of them are there, under one address).  
If you combine the funds from that address with your other UTXOs ("coins", so to speak), everyone who cares to spy on you (chain analytic companies might, just for their records) can follow your balance down the road etc.

This comes up every now and then and although some wallets have `mBTC` display options, it just never catches on.  
This is not how language works in general. New words are adopted organically, and it's very difficult to impose how and which words are used. Satoshis is just catchy and convenient, while mBTC is introducing just another level of complexity.  
There were a few polls on Twitter regarding that, and sats (or just 0.xxxx BTC) wins every time.

Be aware that this might have implications for your privacy, if you mix coins that come from KYC sources (an exchange) with those that are more "private". You might consider mixing with [Wasabi]( first, practice [coin control]( and not store everything on one single address.

Because essentially, an ASIC is just a specialized hardware. You cannot avoid hardware specialization (because it's more efficient, and higher efficiency = higher profitability, for the miner as well as for the hardware manufacturer).  
It's like saying, "why does anyone uses a chef knife, if there are swiss knifes with many different blades in one device?". Well, obviously because it's much more efficient to use a chef knife for the specific task of preparing a dish, even if it would totally suck for cutting wood or something. Specialization is unavoidable, and not a bad thing in itself.

Your question is incomplete. It depends how much bitcoin has appreciated in that time and how much bitcoin you sold.   
Example: you buy one bitcoin for $1k. The price increases ten times, and you sell a fraction of your bitcoin holdings (0.1 bitcoin) for $1k.  
The 0.1 bitcoin was forth $100 when you bought it, and you sold it for $1000. This means, you made a profit of $900 and you need to pay capital gains taxes on it (disregarding yearly tax allowances of your jurisdiction here).  
It doesn't matter here how much money you put into bitcoin afterwards.

It looks pretty close to a bitcoin receiving address if you put either the digit 1 or 3 at the front, but those addresses don't have `-` and `_` symbols. Otherwise it's basically a bitcoin address.

Try this:  
  
On OP: bringing confidentiality on 1st layer is a question of "how exactly?". It also involves a number of trade offs. F.ex, if everything is completely "dark", it's difficult to watch out that the hard cap on the coin supply doesn't get breached (how exactly will nodes verify that everything is correct?). Or that transaction size becomes very big (-&gt; scalability issue).  
On the other hand, tech like Schnorr is (probably) going to be implemented at some point, which, among other things, will make multi-sig transaction look like regular transactions, which is a huge win for privacy.
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:20:39
The important thing is that on a hardware wallet the private key is **and stays** offline at all times. The transactions are signed on the device itself, which makes it safe to use even connected to a malware infested machine.  
On a bootable USB your private key is probably safer than on an average user PC, but it's still on an online machine.

It doesn't have to do with being big or small directly. Bitmain, the biggest mining entity, has lost a significant piece of the hashrate over the last months (due to a bunch of bad economical and technical decisions), f.ex.  
It's a bit more complex, i.e it has to do with your electricity costs, profit margin in general, how big are your reserves (how well prepared are you to survive sustain drop in prices) etc. I guess one might argue that bigger miners are positioned better to survive a drop in bitcoin's prices, but it's not a given. And yes, unprofitable miners will "die" (stop mining) at some point.

Wasabi uses bech32 addresses (starting with "bc1"). Those are not yet supported by a lot of wallets, and I assume ATMs are not likely to be up-to-date in bitcoin tech.  
So probably the ATM will think it's an invalid address. You might want to use an "intermediary" wallet that generates receiving addresses starting with "1" or "2", but can send to bc1 addresses. Samourai (android) and Electrum (desktop, android) are good, f.ex.  
If the ATM is up-to-date, nothing hinders you from sending straight to Wasabi though.

What's the most hated tool at Chainalysis right now (or when you've been working there), from the ones available to regular bitcoin users? Like, Wasabi, Whirlpool, or anything else?  
If one runs their own node on TOR, Electrum Personal Server to connect their hardware wallet to it, and uses Wasabi to coinjoin, this should be pretty safe from the usual analytics stuff, right? Is there anything else you'd add to this tool box personally (I understand it's probably not safe if one is targeted by some state actors or someone *really* wanting to find out stuff..)?
@_date: 2019-10-28 09:36:23


A clean laptop to do sensitive stuff cannot hurt. I would argue though that before one invests effort/money into a new, dedicated laptop, one should invest this effort/money into setting up a full node and connect their hardware wallet to it.  
Reasoning: a hardware wallet such as Trezor/Coldcard/Ledger is actually designed to be usable on an malware infested computer (because the private key never leaves the hardware wallet, the attack surface for malware is very limited). But using any wallet without your own full node hurts your privacy and also implies a large degree of trust into your wallet's manufacturer.  
So while getting a new laptop for the hardware wallet cannot hurt, I think setting up your own full node is a more important step.

I understand what you're saying but I don't understand the relation to my questions, sorry. Mind explaining more?  
My first one was the example with the phone tech - although it is "deflationary" (for the today's amount of money you can buy a better phone in the future), people haven't stopped buying phones.  
The second one was about the narrative of deflationary currency actually improving the standards of investment (people are incentivized less to throw money at mediocre start ups, more incentivized to do research/make good decisions).

Would anyone be able to kindly summarize the proposal in an ELI5 style (if it's possible at all)?  
I understand what a coinjoin is and that previous implementations all require coordination, in order for coinjoins to happen. SNICKER doesn't need coordination and it achieves this by reusing addresses/keys. But I don't entirely get how this roughly works?

Before you decide set up a paper wallet, please give this a thorough read:   
If you know exactly what you are doing with the set up, how to generate and print a private key securely and on an offline machine, you might be fine (and you'll need to know how to construct unsigned transactions and sign them on an offline machine, if you want to spend safely from the paper wallet, which introduces other ways for beginner to screw up).  
An overview of dangers of a paper wallet (source is the link given above):  
* [Printing is problematic](
* [Promotes address reuse](
* [Encouragment of centralized and outsourced validation](
* [Raw private keys are dangerous](
* [Change addresses are not handled which leads to screwups](
* [Encouragement of raw transactions](
* [Low error correction](
* [Inconsistent private key format](
* [Encouragement of obsolete brainwallet style](
* [Javascript software](   
TL;DR:

No, they get a share based on their hashrate. So in your example, if the pool consisted of only two of those participants, the first one (with 6 machines) would get ~1% of the reward, and the second (with 600 machines) would get ~99%. A bit less, because the pool operator takes some small cut too.  
Perhaps there are pools that handle it differently, but roughly this is how it works.

"Team" in the most loose meaning possible. There is no team with some membership to acquire, everything is open and free to participate to anyone. That said, of course it's possible that two or more people collaborate together privately to work on some particular issue, but for this issue to find its way into the codebase, there needs to be scrupulous public peer review and public discussion at some point.

The counterpoint I often hear is: rapidly improving tech, f.ex phones, also incentivizes people to hold off purchases as much as possible into the future (because you'll get a better/cheaper smartphone next year, compared to today). And yet, phone industry is booming.  
Another counterpoint is, that a deflationary currency incentivizes people to be very cautious what they invest it to, which improves the quality of enterprises and companies that people decide investing into.  
What would your response be to those?

Isn't he right though? If, for some reason, only the miners started mining 300k blocks, all the current nodes would accept these blocks without updating, since it's backwards compatible.    
On topic though: no one is lowering the block size. Luke has been talking about it since years, but this idea was rejected (or not even commented upon) by all (or almost all) other people who have been contributing to the Core repository in the last few years.

The counterargument seems to be that steering the economy by a central authority is not easy to do, and prone to failure and outright manipulation (it's easier to print more money than to solve the hard problems etc). So the lack of that option would bring more net positives (by eliminating point of failures and control). What do you think of that argument?

No problems at all :) even with LN running on top of it. Afaik, there has been a number of efficiency improvements in the bitcoin core software, as well as LND, so perhaps the bitcoin.org page is a bit outdated?

Pretty much, except if you have the resources (LOTS of hardware) to mine on your own and carry the risk of variance (you can get "unlucky" for periods of time without being "bailed out" by the other pool participants), business expenses and so on.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:34:06
Don't confuse hashpools being homogenous entities. Hashpools consist of individual miners, which are free to switch over to another hashpool (or just mining on their own) at any time, as soon as they notice their pool operator misbehaving. The pool operator has some degree of control, but only up until awareness of their misbehaviour hasn't kicked in (which is a very short time period, as people pay close attention and word gets around fast on such matters).
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:09:09


You can of course take it with you, but consider this:  
* anyone with access to the device and your PIN will be able to access the funds  
* anyone (you or third person) entering the PIN incorrectly three times will **wipe all data on the device**  
* this means, you will need to access your back up phrase (the 24 words) to re-import your wallet  
* if you carry these 24 words with you all the time, it's a risk (anyone with access to the 24 words has access to your bitcoin)  
* if you don't have the 24 words and you (or someone) wiped your Nano, you're screwed  
* you also need a computer to connect the Nano to, when you want to use it  
So considering all these factors, it's probably much more convenient to get a wallet for your smartphone, transfer a small amount of bitcoin onto it, and leave your Nano (and your back up phrase) safely at home somewhere.  
That said, it is of course possible to take the Nano with you as well, as long as you aware of the trade offs.

Censorship resistance (no one can stop your transaction after it's broadcasted), immutability, permissionless (no entity needs to be passed in order to participate on the protocol level), highly movable (you can pretty much take your entire wealth over every border on earth), highly divisible (even one satoshi is divisible further), highly transferrable (everywhere where's internet, and even offline, through radio waves, satellites, opendimes, paperwallets etc).

Your node verifies and broadcasts other's people transactions without any fee. It doesn't really help the network: a node's primary purpose is to help its owner to verify his own transactions without relying on third parties. Also it gives its owner a higher degree of privacy.  
But of course you are free to run a node just for the fun of it, it's a good learning experience and you might be able to connect your (hardware) wallet to the node at some later point, so it will fulfil its purpose :)

main difference: the bank can censor your payment, or even take away your money, while Lightning is a non-custodial solution (only you have control over your funds).  
Another difference: Lightning is fully anonymous, while banks require full KYC procedures.  
Yet another difference: Lightning is instant, while banks always need some time (days) to settle their transactions (you could make a case for settling closing tx on-chain, but in contrast to banks, they cannot be reversed).  
And one more: you can send sub-cent transactions on Lightning, while banks... well, you get the point :)  
Re: "hot spot": There surely will be nodes that have more connections that a node of an avg user, but they won't be able to exploit their "hub" position in any way (by demanding higher fees, f.ex), because it will be trivially easy to route around these "hot spots", if they misbehave.

It connects to someone's node (presumably, run by the wallet's creators, but could also be random node, like in case of Electrum wallet). This node (as every full node) has a copy of the blockchain and can give your wallet the balance of each address it generated.  
This has a lot of implications for your privacy and your trust model: you have to trust the node you are connecting to to tell you the truth, and you also reveal your bitcoin addresses to it. These are two of the most major reasons why running your own full node (and connecting your wallet to it) is emphasized so much in bitcoin space.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:29
Bitcoin isn't fully private on-chain by default (for now), although there are things like Schnorr and MAST and Taproot/Graftroot incoming "soon". At the moment, you need to reclaim privacy for yourself by doing things like:  
- run your own full node (don't leak your transactions/your IP to nodes of your wallet)   
- try to avoid KYC services, if possible (use Bisq, HodlHodl, in-person buying/selling etc)  
- use Wasabi to mix your coins  
- practice good coin control after the mix  
- consider using Lightning for increased privacy  
- use TOR browser when dealing with bitcoin services (blockexplorers etc)

All the data is public but your difficulty will be to find out which inputs and outputs (=addresses) belong to the same entity/same wallet. Also, most speculative activity happens on exchanges (off-chain). I think the best bet for your purposes is to look at historical exchange data (volume, order books etc). I don't think you will get far with on-chain analysis, as it requires sophisticated tools and is prone to errors in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:30:00
Yes. If you are running a node on a raspberry pi, f.ex, you'll need Electrum wallet installed on your desktop/laptop, and Electrum Personal Server on your pi. Then you open Electrum with your hardware wallet, and set up Electrum so that it reads/sends everything through your own node.  
It sounds a bit tricky, but soon bitcoin core will be implementing hardware wallet support directly, so it'll be less complex (it's not *that* complex anyway, but might sound like it at the first glance ;) )  
Edit: for a raspberry pi node this is a helpful guide for connecting a hardware wallet: 
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:16:59
It's very, very unlikely :)  
1ml doesn't require "registration" of your node, and it lists "zombie" nodes (= inactive/not connected). Other crawlers report something around 3k nodes (I am guessing they don't count those zombie nodes). There is very little incentive to keep your node private, if that's possible/reasonable at all. It's not like bitcoin full nodes, where you can close port 8333, so you can run it just to verify transactions, without anyone being able to connect to you. In lightning, you don't need to verify the network, as all transactions on it are already verified. So it doesn't make sense to run a node no one can connect to. There might be some few usecases for that, but vast majority of nodes should be public.  
So no, there are not ten times more nodes than 3-5k :)

This.  
Basically, you need to send coins to rawtx (make a regular bitcoin transaction from your current wallet to rawtx wallet), and then use these funds on rawtx to open a channel.  
Consider using the testnet version for now if you are unsure what you are doing (not sure if there's a testnet version of rawtx, but there is one by Eclair and other wallets). 
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:28:15
You are comparing apples with oranges. In your example, *you* control the wallet, while in lightning everyone controls their own funds.

I'm not aware of any current proposals that specifically target data compression, but a few proposals like Schnorr, Graftroot/Taproot have an "unintended" efficiency side effect for certain types of transactions (multisig transactions, f.ex).

If you see how bitcoin genuinely solves a problem for a business (f.ex if it struggles to acquire banking services, or has to deal with overreaching regulation, or with lots of customers overseas), sure go ahead and tell them about it.  
Otherwise if you just tell them to accept bitcoin because you want to push your bags, it comes across as super annoying most of the times.

"Reputable" as in "haven't been hacked" yet perhaps. But every third party is a security hole and your data is likely to be leaked or abused sooner or later. They (as well as any other exchange) also work with chain analytic companies (such as Chainalysis, Elliptic etc) which job it is to track bitcoin transactions.

I assume that there is some kind of display error with the wallet, or perhaps it cannot catch up with the network for some reason. Did you download the wallet from a legit source?

You might want using a software wallet for spending "on the go" (without carrying your hardware wallet and connecting it to a computer) or for doing Lightning transactions or other such purposes. Hardware wallet is much more safe for your saving stash though.  


This answer wholly depends on your own financial situation, as well as the level of your technical understanding. If you have debt or no money that you can afford to lose, bitcoin is probably not a worthy investment for you. If you have absolutely no idea how to store it safely, it's also not an "investment" (but you of course can learn how to do all that with small amounts, it's not rocket science either!).   


Yes, but this is an opinion you have to form for yourself (there are plenty of contrary opinions). Start with the info materials in the sidebar ("about" section, if you're on mobile), check out introductory material here:  or have a look at some videos here:

As with regular on-chain bitcoin, you have a choice: use a light-weight wallet (easier set up, no blockchain download/verifying, but delegating a degree of trust to the wallet developers) or set up your own full node (can be a bit tricky, but you have full control of your funds and a higher degree of privacy).  
I guess if you simply want to test things out quickly, you might wanna go with the former. Eclair mobile wallet (android) is a good step to start with.

Since there is no chain involved in Lightning (except for opening/closing channels, which happens on-chain, not on a sidechain), I guess it's the latter. I don't know enough about sidechains to point out specific differences, but compared to the bitcoin's "mainchain", Lightning doesn't involve a consensus mechanism, for example. There is no need for finding a global consensus in Lightning, only the channel partners need to be in consensus and if they are not, they go on-chain for settlement. Hope this makes sense :)

Those are non-mining nodes
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:42:07
There are no "private or public" addresses. There are private keys, public keys, and (receiving) addresses. An address cannot be private (nor public).  
Sharing your public key is not as bad as sharing your public key, but it's still pretty bad for privacy.  
Sharing your receiving address is less bad than the other two above, but has some privacy implications as well (I'm talking here about sharing it on a public forum, obviously you need to share it with the person who is supposed to send you bitcoin).

Ridiculously low. Bitcoin has long passed the GPU mining stage ;)

To an address you provide for this transaction. To generate a receiving address, you need to install a wallet, **back it up** (it will ask you to write down 12 or 24 words, this is your back up phrase.. take good care of it!), and then go to "receive" section of the wallet. It will show you an address (a string of letters + numbers, most likely starting with a "3" or a "1", but that's irrelevant for now).  
Give this address to your bookie.  


Correct. You can adjust fees in your wallet. The sender pays the fees.  
Generally recommended wallets are:

In your position, I'd ask for all my salary paid in btc. 15% salary raise is quite big. Perhaps make sure in advance what the exchange rate your boss will use to determine the btc amount.  
Just learn how to securely store it. Get a hardware wallet. Practice with a small amount first (like, take $20 and learn how to transact it, how to back up a wallet etc).

The article tells about the advantages of bitcoin ETFs, but not of disadvantages (the buyer doesn't hold actual bitcoin,  "not your keys, not your coins" and all that). Another problem is that most of ETFs proposals that I've seen don't sufficiently plan for handling (hard)forks.

You don't need coding knowledge in order to set up a miner, but you'll need a bit of research still. Consider connecting to Slushpool, long standing and fair pool.  
Be aware that you're unlikely to make profit with mining. That is, you will earn bitcoin indeed, but it (most likely) won't cover your electricity costs. Still a good way to get your hands on bitcoin without giving infos to an exchange or other third parties, and a fun way to learn about how bitcoin and mining works. But yeah, check your electricity rates first.

Yes, plus the transactions fees from the transactions included in the particular block. The rewards will halve next year to 6.25 bitcoin, and then halve again four years after that and so on.  


No, why would you mine in a pool if it was the case? :) The pool distributes the rewards to its pool members, this evens out mathematical variance in mining and ensures a more smooth outcome for the single miners.  


Theoretically yes, but practically you might not be able to mine a block on your own. You don't get partial rewards for "almost" mining a block. You'll either mine one or not. But in a pool, a lot of people mine and everyone gets their share when someone from the pool finds a block.

You can know that by either looking at the code (which is open for everyone to see) yourself or by trusting other users/coders that they reviewed the code and didn't find anything suspicious.

A bitcoin eater address is typically a receiving address, for which nobody knows the private keys... meaning, yes if you send coins to those addresses, they should be gone forever. But if there's an outgoing transactions **from** one of such addresses, it indicates that someone **does** have the access to the private keys, otherwise it would be impossible to move those coins **from** that address.

If your wallet can give you the raw transaction (in hex format), which most of the advanced wallets do afaik (like Electrum, Samourai), you can decode it with various tools, like [here]( or [here]( And I think you can even decode it with Bitcoin Core with the `decoderawtransaction` command.

Where do you get that data from? Also, you compare two very different base layers. Ethereum is not as solid and secure as bitcoin's.  I mean, they're starting the whole base layer from scratch with ETH2.0, and the switch-over will take years, as I understand it. It's hella risky move if you want to use it as a secure monetary base layer.

No, that's the beauty of bitcoin: the receiving addresses (which you expose to the internet, i.e Shopify and your customers) are derived from your private keys in such a way, that it's basically an one-way street. You only can derive receiving addresses from private keys, but not vice versa (your private key is something like a very long password, which lets you control all the funds in your wallet).  
So basically, yes, it is extremely safe, **but**: you still need to understand how to store bitcoin properly, and how to back up your hardware wallet. This is crucial, because even though bitcoin itself is extremely secure and "unhackable", there is a number of things you, as user, can do wrong. But don't worry, you'll figure it out, it's not rocket science either ;)

No, but most modern wallets have converged on the [BIP39 standard]( which is a list of 2048 english words. Some wallets might use a different list of words (LND wallet, f.ex), or non-english words (not aware of any software examples).  


Many attempts have been already tried, and some people might still do it, but the expenses in energy, hardware and other resources are simply not worth it. Imagine you have to find a few atoms somewhere in the universe by simply guessing where they might be... Yeah, you might get lucky in theory, but the odds are unimaginable small. Like, really really really small (still possible though if your wallet totally sucks at producing randomness... which some old wallets were in the past. Imagine if you use your birthday date and encrypt it. The encryption is unbreakable, but it's still easy to simply guess).  
Not related to the specific question, but here's a nicely put together FAQ regarding seed phrases, might be of interest to you:

The reason is that for current coinjoin implementations (Wasabi, Samourai) you need to wait for enough people to join in and then sign/send the transaction. With a hardware wallet, you only can sign/send the transaction when you are physically present (you need to click a button on the device itself). At least, that's my current understanding.  
I'm sure this will be solved at some point, but I don't know a mobile wallet that supports both HW and coinjoin at the moment (Wasabi lets you connect your HW though, but you need to make a separate transaction in order to use coinjoin).
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:55:14
Trezor and Ledger (Nano S) are both a good choice for a start. There are minor technical differences between them, but nothing that might interest a newcomer, I think.

It's either because of fees (from Simplex's side), or because your wallet and their wallet use different bitcoin-to-fiat conversion rate (there is no "official" rate, it depends on the particular exchange, and exchanges have slight differences in prices), or most likely, a combination of both. It's better to look at the bitcoin amount directly, because the fiat price is not reliable in such cases.

It's (partially at least) unavoidable and serves a purpose. Everyone has a voice and no one is in charge. So there'll be dissenting opinions and debates and forks and whatnot.

If you put the seed phrase into a new wallet, it's kinda senseless to destroy your hardware wallet in the first place :)  
A hardware wallet is safer to transact from btw (compared to a software wallet), because it keeps your private key offline at any time.
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:48:52
A mix of both, I guess.  
I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that ASIC resistance is very difficult to achieve, and comes with certain trade-offs. Mainly, with a lessened security for the network: because hardware manufacturers are disincetivized to produce mining hardware, there will be less hashpower available overall, and it takes less resources to initiate doublespend attacks or other types of malicious behaviour. With ASICs, the costs of attack would be much, much higher. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:11:55
Although the satoshis are probably "real", you have to trust the lntip bot that they are. Which is basically the opposite of what bitcoin is trying to achieve, namely: send value without having to trust anyone else.  
So ultimately, those satoshis are just a number on the tip bot's database and you cannot verify if they're real or not, until you try to cash them out to your own wallet. You can use that as an incentive to learn more about how that all works ;)

Yes. In short, it's because Lightning consists of "real" bitcoins, and to make sure they're "real", you need to validate their authenticity for yourself (and you only can trust your own node for that), before you start opening and accepting channels.  
You can use Lightning without a node though (or more precise: by using nodes of your wallet), but in order to run a Lightning node yourself, you need a bitcoin node, too (as of now, at least).

I am not particularly trained in philosophical or logical thought, and I haven't thought about that all too deeply, so perhaps (probably) there are flaws in my thinking.   
But any time I think about inherent value, I arrive at a similar stage as our discussion also has reached, and the only thing that seems reasonable to me is to conclude, that nothing has inherent value indeed. This doesn't mean I don't see value in anything in the world -  I do, but I don't expect anyone else to agree with my value assignments, and they don't seem very objective to me.

Empty mempool and low fees on weekends is obviously nice for consolidating outputs and for low-time preference transactions to go through, but ultimately (as things stand right now), bitcoin won't be able to survive the halvings without fees being high (hashrate needs incentives to keep on mining after block rewards become negligible).  
Also, when the price goes 10x, the fees denominated in USD will go 10x as well, even if they stay the same in sat/byte.

Yes, you figured it out! :)  (edit: except for the "exact same amount" part, you can also spend lower amounts, the change will be returned to your wallet, but then you'll have to be careful not to spend this change with your other inputs)  
So your choice is either to "send from this address" (tbh I'm not familiar with Electrum too much, but this sounds like exactly the option you need, it also is called "coin selection" or "coin control" sometimes).  
Your other option would be to use [Wasabi wallet]( It implements coin selection as well, but it mixes your inputs with inputs of other participants (called "coinjoin"). This involves another transaction though (from Electrum to Wasabi)*, plus the mixing round, which can take a while (depending on how many people are participating in the round. But it enables another privacy level on top. And after you've done the coinjoin, you can send transaction just like regular transactions, only that they've been "decoupled" from the previous inputs.  
\* or you probably can just import the private key from Electrum to Wasabi, if you want to use all of your Electrum's wallet funds. Also keep in mind, that you need ~0.01 btc in order to participate in the coinjoin rounds. Unfortunately, it's not possible to participate with smaller amounts yet.

My understanding is vague on this topic, so treat accordingly. I think your watchtower doesn't need to be online 24/7. It should be sufficient for it just to check every couple of days for unilateral closes (where your partner closed the channel with your "agreement" = your node being offline at that time, f.ex). Only in such an unilateral close you'd be at danger of being cheated (and only if you have been receiving funds... if you've been only sending - you don't need watchtowers at all). And as there is a timelock on settling the channel, your watchtower should have quite a bit of time to go online and verify.  
I think a watchtower would only matter in a scenario where all three conditions are met: 1) you have open channels, 2) you know (or suspect) that your node will be completely offline for a couple of days AND 3) you've been receiving funds.  
THEN you might need a watchtower, and it only needs to be online every other day or so. It doesn't need to be a third party: it can be something on your computer, or your phone.  
Again, disclaimer: my understanding might be off by quite a bit, so hopefully someone can correct or confirm. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:31:08
I don't entirely remember how long the unilateral close time locks (when you force close a channel) are supposed to be, but I'm pretty certain it's longer than 24 hours, so I assume it just will go through at some point.  
If you want to make sure on the exact times, you probably should ask Eclair directly, there are various way to do that (they have a Gitter channel, f.ex, and surely they have an email support as well)

"BTC" is a ticker used on exchanges, and sometimes is used as an abbreviation for "bitcoin". Bitcoin Core is an implementation, an actual software that you can [download]( and use as a full node. See for an explainer here:

You can import them, but I hope you understand that under no circumstances should you use them to receive transactions or anything like that. And also take good care of your actual private key (don't confuse it with the imported ones etc).  
May I ask why you want to import publicly known private keys in the first place?

The utility of bitcoin (at least for me personally) is it being: censorship-resistance, permissionless, secure (immutable), borderless (not subject to a particular jurisdiction) and open-source (it profits from contributions and innovation from multiple parties). Also, I can verify all the transactions and the max supply on my own (you need to pay facebook 10 million USD in order to run a validating node).  
I don't see how FB can compete with that. At best, they compete with PayPal and the likes.
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:03:59


Correct. Opening a Lightning channel for one single transaction wouldn't make much sense (perhaps privacy?). Note though, that you can keep on using your channel after that one transaction (see later points).  


There are minimal fees (1 satoshi or less per hop) if your payment gets routed over multiple nodes (if you're not directly connected to the node you are sending to).  


No. Here you either misunderstand something or I misunderstand your definition of "self-hosted". You don't need a direct channel with someone (be it a merchant or just someone you want to send funds to), it's enough to have an indirect connection (if it's "self-hosted" or not is irrelevant here).  


Not yet.  


You can of course store your entire wallet across multiple LN channels. But I wouldn't do that with my entire wealth :D there are still risks involved.  


Well, the funds move only **within** a given channel. If you have a channel with Alice (let's call it channel A) and Alice has a channel with Bob (channel B), you can send a payment to Bob. But the actual funds move only within the channels. So first you send funds in channel A, they arrive at Alice's side of the channel, and then Alice moves the funds in channel B to Bob's side. This means, she routed the payment from you to Bob.  
It might sound tricky but it actually not that hard to understand. Maybe this will do a better job than me:   


Yes, creating a channel requires an on-chain transaction. The number on confirmations depends on the software, but afaik they all require three confirmations.   


Partially there seem some misunderstandings on your side, but partially it's just correct that LN has some inherent limitations, at least at the moment. And yes, there are things being worked on, nothing will be built overnight :)

Each of those topics requires somewhat a long write up if you want to discuss them in depth, and they have been asked an infinite amount of times on this sub, so only briefly: 
1) network effects (people don't like to deviate once a standard has been set); promises of altcoins to solve bitcoins issues mostly involve trade-offs in some other areas ("faster" transactions mean less security, or more decentralization etc).  
2) quantum computing is vastly overrated in this context, no threat for the foreseeable future. F.ex listen here:   
3) Governments can regulate the infrastructure (exchanges), but not the protocol itself and the open source software around it (wallets, bitcoin core software etc). Also, governments of the world will not be able to coordinate their views and actions on a global scale.

I guess you have to manually add the theoretical step of disposing crypto A to fiat, before buying crypto B.  
So f.ex you bought crypto A with fiat. Then you traded crypto A for crypto B.  
What you need to enter in bitcoin,tax would then be: Buy A for $. Sell A for $ (you have to estimate the value of A in $ at the moment of trading A for B). Buy B (adding the value of B in $ terms at the moment of trade).  
So essentially, you treat the trade of A for B as if you sold A for fiat and bought B with fiat.

Correct! 


The only fallacy is a lack of understanding :)  
Perhaps it's more helpful to think in percentages? 21 mln  bitcoins is 100% of the supply. If 1 bitcoin would be all bitcoin there is, it's also 100% of the supply. Regardless how many times you divide the supply, you cannot have more than 100%.  
The actual number is arbitrary, as you already pointed out. All that matters is the maximum supply. It doesn't matter how many subunits you create, if you cannot inflate the overall supply.  
For me, this sounds more complicated than the cake analogy, but perhaps it'll be more understandable this way.

As u/violencequalsbad already wrote, it's just a shorter form of saying "fully validating node", as opposed to so-called SPV wallets (sometimes called "light wallets" or "light clients"). A fully validating node downloads and verifies all the transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, starting from the genesis block, while a SPV wallet only checks the block headers.

Yes, FIFO (first in first out) is one of the common methods, but this really depends on one's jurisdiction. 
 
Another common method is to calculate the average cost of your holdings and go from there.  
So say you bought 1 btc for $1.2k and then 2 more btc for $1k. Your average cost is $1.06k: (1 x 1.2 + 2 X 1) / 3 = 1066.66.  
Usually there are some guidelines issued by authorities of which method to use. Otherwise contact an accountant.

It shows the amount of blocks that have been attached to bitcoin's blockchain after your transaction. The more blocks, the harder it is to remove your transaction from the blockchain (it is already pretty hard after one block, but for large transactions it is recommended to wait for 3-6 confirmations).  
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:55:39


Yes, every on-chain transaction gets verified and recorded forever (after it gets mined into a block). Keep in mind that one transaction can represent multiple senders/receivers, btw.  


Yes, it's called "pruning" (it "cuts off" parts of the blockchain which are not strictly needed after verification).

You have to discern between the Lightning Network as a protocol (or the network of nodes itself), and the protocol implementations that are built using this protocol. An open source network/protocol cannot really have a roadmap (who would be in charge to decide what to build when?). 
 
The implementations of the protocol are built by Lightning Labs, Acinq and c-lightning. Those are more likely to have something like a roadmap, but even they are mostly developed through voluntary contributions and testing, so there's also not really a timeline for different features. Your best bet is to follow the development on the respective GitHub repository to observe the progress (or deduct it by other metrics, such as app development etc).
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:51:02
I don't know any blockexplorer that recognizes actual public keys? And what purpose would that serve in the first place? :)  
Typically, you look up receiving addresses in a block explorer. And a receiving address "is a 160-bit hash of the public portion of a public/private ECDSA keypair."   
So a public key is not the same as a receiving address (the latter is derived from the former though).

I would argue it is actually becoming less centralized. At the beginning, there were only Satoshi plus 1-2 people mining... Now we have various mining pools, and it's far away from easy to collude in any form:   
Especially since mining pools consists of individual operators, which are acting in their own interests, not in the interest of the mining pool they point their hashrate to.

Do you have a transaction ID (perhaps called 'TXID' or something similar)? You can plug it into a blockexplorer (like  and look up if it has been confirmed. You can do the same with the receiving address (the one that the other person gave you) and see if your transaction is displayed on this address or not.

It's a noble goal! But the network doesn't rely on altruism (it wouldn't work in the first place, if it did), it's a common misconception that you help it by running a node. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't run one! If and when you decide to actually connect a (hardware) wallet to it, you'll reap all the benefits of having your own, fully validating node. And it also helps you to learn about how the network works, so by any means, have fun with your fresh node :)

Running your own full node ensures a higher degree of privacy and minimizes trust into third parties.  
When you don't have your own full node, your wallet connects to *someone else's* full node and leaks information to it.

It gets a bit murky, because these words are sometimes used incorrectly, but in general: UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) = coins. There are no actual coins that get moved on a protocol level, you only have UTXOs.

Yeah, that's one of the quirks of bitcoin/bitcoin software. Although your wallet shows as empty, you still could "return" your funds by either of two methods: one is called "replace by fee" (you construct another transaction with the same coins, but with higher fees, which the miners will prioritize over the original transaction, and with the destination address generated by your own wallet).  
The other one is "child pays for parent" (CPFP), where you construct a subsequent transaction involving the original transaction, but you attach higher fees to the subsequent transaction, so miners are incentivized to include it in a block (which will automatically confirm the original transaction as well).  
For both methods, you can use a new receiving address: either your own, or of the original recipient. This means, you still have control over the funds, even if your wallet shows as empty.  
Forgetting all that: if your transaction isn't confirmed for a long while (something like two weeks), it is essentially as if it never happened and your wallet will show your funds as having never "left". But much more likely is that the transaction will simply be confirmed sooner or later.

"as safely as possible" is a wide range. There is hardly an upper limit how "safe" you want to go, but as higher you go, the more complicated and costly it gets. You need to find a sweet spot on the range that a) is within your budget and b) within your technical competency (otherwise you increase the chance of screwing something up).  
A hardware wallet is the best choice for a vast majority of average usecases, but since that's out of the question, you probably will be fine with a simple mobile wallet, with a properly secured seed phrase (written down by hand and stored away somewhere safe).

I agree with you on the tendency to professionalize mining, but I disagree on the consequences. In your worst-case scenario (everyone colludes to increase the minimum fees), it: a) becomes profitable for individual miners (or mining pools) to deviate from the collusion strategy to profit on fees, which other (colluding) miners don't include. And b) there will be ideologically motivated miners, which won't collude no matter what.  
Following this game-theoretical logic, I don't think it ever will be the optimal strategy for miners to collude.  
Another argument against collusion is that it might lower the value of bitcoin (because people lose confidence and trust), thus rendering the value of the equipment and investments of *all* miners substantially.  
So it seems to me that the economical incentives for the miners "force" them to play according to the rules, and "colluding" would be a strictly worse strategy (and requiring a collaboration of the majority of miners, which is difficult to achieve in the first place), than to just mine normally

Usually, wallets don't give information about the size of the transaction directly, but give the cost (in sat/byte) derived from the size. Maybe some more advanced wallets like Electrum or Samourai do show the size, too, but I'm not sure.  
After you sent the tx, you can see the size in any of the popular block explorers (blockchain, blockstream, oxt and so on)

Finally found something from the dev mailing list:   


transactions on the bitcoin network today.  Blockchain and Coinbase
together have 30 million users.  **Those users are all the silent majority
that don't comment on social media.**  They just want their transaction to
work, without preference for container size, but with a preference for a
lower fee and less congestion.  These users have likely never run a full
node and have no reason to.

It's a known (and continuously decreasing) quantity though, and in ~12 years the vast majority of bitcoin already will be mined. After that, we still can expect losses of bitcoin (decrease in the supply), as well as increase in price (as the general assumption in the space goes). So yes, I'm insinuating that bitcoin is deflationary in the mid-/long-run. Although this hasn't anything to do with my questions in the previous post :)

It's not, but they need you to voluntarily give them the private keys (or do the transaction). Any other type of asset is seizable without your cooperation (and even if you dig a hole for your gold somewhere, it's still subject to being found, randomly or by other methods). With bitcoin, if you store your seed properly, a confiscation would be simply impossible without your cooperation.

I haven't tried it. Once again, you (and I am implying myself here as well as ~99%+ of all people) are losing money on each average trade, if they actively (day)trading. If you do it for fun and understand that you're losing money, then go for it (some people like to gamble and that's absolutely fine). But understand that you will be losing money in the long-run.   
This is regarding daytrading (or any other form of short-term trading). A buy-and-hold strategy is something different, but its profitability depends on the underlying asset.

No. If this would possible, bitcoin wouldn't be working as it is. Sorry for your loss, I hope it wasn't a lot.  
Your only chance would be to social engineering the scammer into making a mistake that you can exploit, but I don't think that's a worthwhile task. I'd advise learning more about bitcoin and chalk your loss up as an expensive lesson (or an incentive to learn a lesson).

Since there is no specific type of society in which bitcoin thrives (although you probably can assume it's a fairly technologically advanced one), it's really difficult to recommend. Bitcoin doesn't need a particularly dystopian society, nor a utopian one. It might have a thriving position in both extremes, and somewhere inbetween, too.  
I guess there are some cypherpunk novels, which take place in rather dystopian societies, which you might find interesting, but this shouldn't be understood as such types of society is necessary for bitcoin to flourish.

I think it's better to want people to educate themselves about bitcoin. If masses of "dumb money" flows into bitcoin, pushing the price up, and then losing their coins due to bad security, scams, bad practices, not holding their private keys etc, its going to hurt adoption somewhat. At least short-term.

A blockchain is just a way to structure data. A chain of blocks, or basically... a database.

51% of miners colluding cannot change consensus rules. They fork themselves off the network if they mine incompatible blocks. Mining empty blocks is not a big issue either (it might slow down the transaction confirmations, but it is costly for the "colluding" miners and won't do much damage). Double spends are obviously a problem, but also not that bad (everyone should wait for a few confirmations anyway, when dealing with larger transactions), as miners can only doublespend their own coins, not from some random wallets.  
Besides that, if an alternative is ready and known, it would allow the attacking miners to prepare a strategy as well. Also, a hardfork depends on consensus, which in turn depends on what the attack actually does and why, so it's kinda senseless to prepare for such unknowns in advance.

Miner are not needed to verify transactions, you need them to mine transactions into a block (they don't actually need to be verified to be mined, but then the miner risks that his block will be rejected by other nodes/miners).  
Anyway, to get bitcoin onto the lightning network, you need to make an on-chain transaction, and this transaction needs to be confirmed in a block. So each and every satoshi that is on the lightning network, has been confirmed as "legit". In order to transact satoshis within the lightning network, miners are not necessary though. Only when you want to withdraw satoshis from the lightning network, they need again to be mined (confirmed) by a miner.   
Your other questions are too broad to answer in a brief way.

I consider any input which can be linked to my identity as "tainted" (although yes, there's no such thing on the protocol level).  
Also, while you cannot be made responsible for holding dollars which have been used for whatever crime, it's not uncommon for exchanges and KYC merchants to check where your bitcoins have been a few "hops" ago. If they suspect the coins of being used in criminal activity, they might refuse service.  
Even worse, chain analytics can be used in courts, and since those analytics are neither perfect nor transparent, you can be in really bad luck in such situation.  
Sadly, bitcoin is not perfectly private and it's better to adopt good practices for personal privacy than to rely on goodwill of third parties.

You could set up a 2of3 or 3of5 multisig wallet, and distribute the keys between yourself, your spouse and your kids (or your spouse and your lawyer, or involve a specialized company like Casa). Or you could put away your private keys in a vault and give your family instructions how to extract them.  
There are also other solutions. Sure, they all involve some degree of trust and/or trade offs in usability/complexity, but they exist and you are free to use them.

If you are concerned about privacy when disclosing to others that you are a bitcoin holder (which is a good attitude actually, imo), you can simply avoid paying in bitcoin? Who is forcing you to?  
Also, again, don't carry your bitcoin savings on a phone with you. It's not that hard to avoid :)

"Open source web-based wallets" is somewhat an oxymoron. You want open source so you don't have to trust closed source, but with a web wallet you still need to trust their servers to keep your keys secure.  
Don't use web wallets. Get a smartphone wallet or a desktop wallet (Electrum or Wasabi), or a hardware wallet (you should use those with Electrum or Wasabi anyway though).

Don't do day trading :)  
You are on a playing field against opponents who have an edge over your analytical, logical and emotional skills, your money management skills and who have been in this game for years. In order to win at day trading, you have to understand where the edge is and how to be better than those opponents. But then you also need to beat taxes, exchange fees and the pure short-term variance.  
In short, don't do it. Spend your time more wisely :)

Bech32 **is** actually segwit. But some wallets haven't yet updated their abilities to recognize bech32 addresses. It's a question of implementation for them at this point.

There is no and probably will not be **THE** scaling solution. 2nd layer like Lightning network serves some of the usecases that aren't possible on-chain (microtransactions and instant payments), although with certain trade-offs. Then we have on-chain optimizations that use blockspace more efficient: Schnorr signatures, bech32 addresses, SegWit (effectively increases blocksize over 1mb) and so on.

Exchanges (as well as other KYC obliged services) are generally more likely to over-comply than to under-comply in an uncertain environment, because they want to show themselves as "good players" to authorities when the push comes to shove.  
You could observe it only recently when Binance refused a withdrawal of a user which they thought would withdraw to Wasabi. I'm quite certain that they weren't required to do so by law (and they couldn't possibly know that the withdrawal address actually was from Wasabi), but were over-complying with KYC regulations in order to present themselves as upholding the regulations as much as possible. Same goes for sharing data, most likely (at least it's safer to assume).

I probably would recommend this video by Andreas for a more general understanding of risk/security trade-offs between different storage methods:   
Paper wallets might be an option, if you don't intend to transact your bitcoin any time soon AND you feel confident enough to set one up securely. But they have their own risks, and ultimately, you need to store a piece of paper somewhere (same as you need to store your seed phrase if you set up a wallet on your mobile phone). I would recommend against a paper wallet, tbh.

The fee doesn't have to do anything with the amount being sent. It has to do with how large your transaction is in kilobytes. Think of it as a digital file (f.ex a photo) that you send to someone: the larger the picture, the more it costs to send it.  
Next logical question would be: how can it be that bitcoin transactions have different size? Shouldn't a transfer of one bitcoin be exactly the same as the transfer of one other bitcoin?  
Not quite. Think of it as different (actual, physical) money denominations: I can give you $100 in a bunch of pennies, or $1 bills, or one single $100 bill. The **value** of that transaction doesn't fluctuate, but the **size** of it varies a lot. The larger the **size** of a bitcoin transaction, the more fees you end up paying (don't worry, your wallet takes care of calculating that stuff).  
There are various sites that can help you with better fee estimation, f.ex  - it shows you how much satoshi per byte you should select in your wallet and an estimation (in %) how much time it would currently take for the transaction to be confirmed.  
You also can see how many transaction are currently waiting to be confirmed here:

@_date: 2019-12-06 19:48:28


That's roughly(!) how it works, yes. There is a bunch of heuristics to estimate the likelihood that your addresses further "down the road" (addresses B and C in your example) belong to you. F.ex if you make one single transaction that spends all the funds on an address, it has a high likelihood of being a self-transfer, since a payment to someone else would likely involve a change output (it almost never happens that you spend the exact amount on your address to a merchant f.ex, there's almost always a change output). Various other ways how to screw up privacy, like merging of UTXOs, looking transactions up on a blockexplorer that collects data etc.  
Also, have you thought about which node exactly your wallet is connecting to, if it's not your own node? Every wallet needs a node to work and if it's not yours, you are sending information to a third party.

Keeping x coins (of which you keep full control and ownership) in a channel is not the same as paying x coins to someone, I would say :)  
If keeping coins in a channel is an issue, you also can open a channel to an exchange or service provider like bitrefill, make a deposit through lightning, and withdraw the funds from exchange back to your on-chain address. In this way, you balanced your channel such that all the balance is on the opposite side (you can now receive funds), while the money is actually back in your own on-chain wallet.  
Not saying it's the best way (it involves certain trade-offs), but one of the possibilities for balancing.

Great question.  
I think this topic is multi-layered (partially because our "social problem"* is not very well defined here, imo) and deserves a deeper discussion.  
I wouldn't say bitcoin is really vulnerable to social attacks to the point that it can be destroyed, but it is definitely subject to some kind of social consensus. Because ultimately, code is maintained and run by humans. I mean, if all bitcoin users would suddenly decide that they don't want to use it for some reason, it would weaken bitcoin very substantially (weakening its security, pseudonymity and so on). At the same time, all bitcoin users are incentivized (by various ways) to keep it going, to protect the network from malice etc.  
I am not sure if I subscribe to the "social contract" theory lied out in the article, but this investigates that point quite well:   
\* perhaps it is helpful to note that the social problem bitcoin solves is that you don't need to trust third parties when transacting over bitcoin's network. But I guess one could argue that you need some kind of "macro trust" to the broader space if you want to hold bitcoin over decades, that bitcoin holder won't abandon the network. There is also some form of trust into economic incentives of bitcoin holding up over time. But tbh, I need to think about this a little more. I think it's a great question and an interesting topic.

Since it's an open source network, you can adjust the code in whichever way you like, it has been like this since the beginning ;)   
And since decisions like this don't involve consensus from other nodes (like bitcoin on-chain), all you need is a channel partner who has compatible channel rules with yours and you can open channels with whatever balance limits you want.

1) mining pool operators != miners (very important to understand) . 
2) it pays more to mine according to the rules of the network, an attacker would need to be irrational or have something else to gain that offsets the huge attack costs (mining equipment becoming worthless, spending large amounts of $ on electricity, disclosing your hand, reputational costs etc etc)  


They would fork themselves off the network in this case. So 54% (or whatever it actually is in reality, see point 1) of mining power would go on to mine an altcoin.

That's as straight as you can get :)  
Where is a car located before it gets built? We can go into a philosophical debate about what constitutes a "car" and what it means to exist (which is fun, too), but for all practical purposes it is fair to say that a car doesn't exist (and thus cannot have a location) until it is built, and the entity who builds that car owns it.

You're conflating here two different (but of course not entirely separated) things: banking system as a whole, and the payment rails they're using/providing. The payment rails are great and convenient, if you can use them (until you experience some form of censorship or limitations). The underlying banking system is something different though.  
To be frank, I am not knowledgeable enough to describe what exactly the problem is, but it just looks untrustworthy and unsustainable to me. I trust in bitcoin more, because I understand it better and it seems more robust, open and logical to me.  
This doesn't mean that I have to abolish the convenience the payment rails of the banking system provide me. I'll gladly use it as long as it suits me, but I sure as hell don't want to be reliant on the underlying banking system, at least not entirely reliant on it.

If you're happy with the "perfectly functional system that currently exists", nobody forces you to stop using it and switch to bitcoin :)

This depends on your channel balance (f.ex if all your channels have funds only on your own side, it's useless for routing) and the connectivity (what kind of peers have you created your channels with?). And also yes, the routing fees do play a role, but the first two things are more important (even with slightly higher than average fees you would be able to route every once in a while, if you have well-balanced channels to "popular" peers).

Sure, a physical/regulatory attack from the state is always a concern if big mining operations concentrate in a particular geographical area.  
However, there is not *that* much the government would be able to do with that equipment, besides mining bitcoin for profit itself.  
It could certainly try to doublespend but this is kinda stealing a tank and trying to rob a bank with it (you are revealing your hand and you won't gain much from such an attack in terms of $ profit). This will cause short-term disruption undoubtedly, not because for the doublespend itself, but for the reason that there is a state trying to do something shady.  
If there is a known doublespend attack going on, it's trivially mitigated by merchants and exchanges increasing the amount of confirmations before they accept a deposit/payment.

TL;DR: Coinbase bought a start-up specialized on blockchain analysis. Members of that start-up have been working for "Hacking Team", which provided spying tools for authoritarian regimes, which have been used for deanonymizing and prosecute regime critics, journalists and dissidents. For example, the Hacking Team worked with the same Saudi enforcement group that later played a role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

It's up to you, really, but you have to understand that letting a third party (any exchange, not just coinbase) control your funds has certain risks (they might decide to let you hop through some funds verification, they might get hacked etc).  
For your own benefit you should understand how to keep coins under your own control, and what private keys are etc. Also look up what hardware wallets are (Trezor and Ledger Nano S are the most known ones).

Thanks u/belcher_ for your work :)  
For anyone not knowing what this neat software does: it allows you to connect your Electrum wallet to your Bitcoin Core node. And you can connect your hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard) to Electrum.  
So f.ex if you run a node on Raspberry Pi, you have: Hardware wallet -&gt; Electrum (on desktop) -&gt; Electrum Personal Server (on Raspberry) -&gt; Bitcoin Core (on Raspberry).  
This setup allows you to use your HW with your own full node. This has advantages because you don't leak your bitcoin transactions to Ledger's/Trezor's backend (without your own node, the wallet has to ask their nodes for every transaction you make). Also, you don't have to trust third parties anymore when receiving bitcoin transactions.

I have a feeling you might have misunderstood something here. Using your own node doesn't have to do with preventing anyone from "becoming the worlds foremost bitcoin miner/hacker", and neither is it an act of patriotism.

Disappearance of block subsidy (currently 12.5 btc per block; will be 1.5625 btc in nine years/3 halvings) implies that miners will need to be incentivized by transactions fees to keep mining. This in turn implies that at least one of those things will have to happen: price continuing to rise, transactions fees continuing to rise, blockspace will need to be either more efficient or bigger to allow for more transactions (more income for miners).  
How much those need to rise in order to keep bitcoin secure is difficult to say (also it's difficult to actually put a number on what "secure" really means). But yeah, disappearing block subsidy will need to be "replaced" by something over the course of the next 9-13 years.

Edit: turns out, version 0.1.2 was released on [11th of January]( the day of the tweet, so it's possible that Hal was using this version :) Also, there was no "pre-release" before the 8th of January release... The first block of bitcoin (after the genesis block) was mined on 9th of January.

The main point for the ledger "to be seen" is that nobody can screw around with the max supply (or do other malicious things like doublespends), and the easy verification of the rules by anyone who has the desire to do so.  
"Mixing" (or coinjoin, more specifically) does not take anything away from the verifiabilty of those protocol rules, while adding a desirable layer of privacy. So it has a point, and a very good one at that.

It's actually open source:   
But even if you don't want to use it (I don't either because it still has to enquire their node about your transactions), you can use your Ledger with the Electrum wallet instead. Preferably with your own ful node of course...
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:15:11
edit: misread your post (missed the *not*), sorry. But in any case, afaik you don't need to change anything in the config file, because by default the port 8333 is closed anyway and you won't be uploading a lot, if no one can connect to you through that port (in my understanding)
You don't need "leave it wide open" for uploading. You can leave your port closed, and even if you want to open it, you can limit the upload and/or peer connections. Basically, you don't need to do anything apart from downloading the software and let it sync (which it does automatically).  
Connecting a wallet to the node might be tricky, in case you don't wanna use bitcoin core wallet, but nothing too heavy either.

This might be a good point, I haven't considered it. I wonder what DOS protection the nodes have against sustained attacks? Perhaps they are already well equipped against it, but if not, your point would be true.  
In any case, in favour of your argument I'll add  the privacy benefit: the more nodes there are, even if they're unused, the more difficult it becomes to spy on and identify the maintainers of used nodes.

**Never do something like this again**  
Except if you or multiple trustworthy sources have verified the code and can vouch that it is all legit (even if your keys don't get transmitted, the randomness generator can be broken/rigged).  


No.   


Ledger's code is open source. One part of hardware isn't. This is not strictly better or worse than Trezor: it has different security and trust trade-offs, but I am not sure if this is something a beginner should put a lot of thought into at the beginning. Either of those will be much better than storing coins on a non-hardware wallet or exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:26:05
This doesn't work in the way you imagine. You cannot make copies of infrastructure, users, developers, miners and so on (and if you could theoretically, you'd just have the exact same system, so why would anyone switch?). And if you introduce only slight changes, you'd again need to convince everyone to switch. But if the changes are only minor, why should anyone switch? You'd need larger changes, and really really good ones. But are those even possible? Why not simply introduce those changes to bitcoin directly, if they're *that* good?
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:57:38
It's possible and works exactly the same way as any other transaction. Create a new receiving address in the "native segwit" account of your Ledger Live software, copypaste this address to the "recipient address" field in the "segwit" account (check the first and last few digits of the address!) and send the transaction.  
You probably want to adjust the fees pretty low (lower than the default... even 1sat/byte will probably be enough to have it confirmed over night or so), as I assume the tx is not really time sensitive.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:38:02
"Congestion" is an annoyance, mostly because the fee estimation algorithms are not perfect in wallets, and also you cannot predict such annoyances. Meaning, if you have an urgent transaction and you were unlucky, you might have to wait longer that you'd like to. But ultimately, if you are willing to pay a little more than average, your transaction gets through as fast as it would without "congestion". It's not like a traffic jam or something.  
That said, block space is a scarce good (because it's limited). If you want a scarce good (inelastic in its supply), and the demand rises suddenly, you will have to pay more to acquire that good. It's simply the way it works as of now.  
There are a number of improvements (segwit) and best practices (batching) that have been introduced, and will be introduced (schnorr), as well as layer two solutions (lightning), in order to make such congestions less annoying, but ultimately, block space will be limited forever (even if you make blocksize bigger, you will hit a limit at some point). Also the transaction fees (remember, with a high enough transaction fee the congestion actually doesn't matter) is what is supposed to secure the network in something like 10-12 years from today on, so a fee market will have to emerge at some point anyway. And yes, there are different opinions about that.

Happy to hear it is helpful :)  
The whole UTXOs and coincontrol/coinjoin concepts are quite tricky to understand for a beginner (it took me a long time to get into it myself), so you seem to have figured it out much quicker than me :D  
You don't really need to "air gap" your Ledger btw. It's enough that you ditch the Ledger Live software and use Electrum instead. You can then connect Electrum to your personal node through Electrum Personal Server (or ElectrumX or Electrums). The setup process is described here under "bonus" section:   - but there are also other setup possibilities. Another option is of course to ditch Ledger itself and get a Coldcard, which is indeed an airgapped wallet (but this is more for security than privacy, because you still have to broadcast and receive your transactions somehow).   
In any case, don't feel discouraged if it all looks scary. It takes time to  process and understand the setups etc, but it's all definitely doable even for newbs (I'm speaking out of experience, haha) :)

The working repository for the code is  It's open source and anybody can participate. There are frequent updates (mostly maintenance related things, and "bigger" updates every once in a while, after peer review and discussions). But it's just a repository, by itself it doesn't have any power.

The Twitter link/screenshot is not very informative.  
As I understand it, Wasabi offers "partial Bitcoin Core integration". I'm not entirely sure what this means, but from my understanding it doesn't mean that Wasabi itself functions as a fully validating node (meaning, it doesn't download/verify/store all blocks like f.ex Bitcoin Core does)?

I don't think so. The majority of people seem to want someone who they can delegate trust (or some part of it) to. Just look at how many people still store their coins on exchanges nowadays (which essentially*are* banks).  
I do think however that having options to be your own bank is critically important even for those people, because it gives them an option to exit, which forces banks to misbehave less. And of course there are people that already have exited, even if partially.

Funny how much wrong things one can stuff in just one sentence :) Just responding to one of them:  


An node going offline does not cause loss of funds. Going offline for a substantial amount of time is dangerous only if: you have been receiving substantial payments + the counterparty (the one sending those payments) wants to cheat you + you are not back online for a long time after the cheating attempt (like a few days or a week or so). Only **then** you might lose those received payments (because the cheater will come away with his cheating attempt). Remember, a cheater loses his entire channel balance if you notice his cheat attempt (and he probably doesn't know you're offline anyway), which should strongly disincentivize cheating attempts in the first place.  
Simply taking your node offline does not do anything to your funds.

Non-custodial means you don't have to trust a third party (a custodian) with your bitcoin. This is a good thing  (because you are in full control of your bitcoin, and not the custodian). So you probably shouldn't change your wallet for this part. But closed source wallet is usually a no-go indeed.

A node is a software that runs on a computer controlled by you personally (a desktop, laptop, or a cheap mini computer like a raspberry pi, or even an android phone). The most popular node software is Bitcoin Core:   
Running your own node makes sure that you don't have to rely on third parties to validate your bitcoin transactions (otherwise you have to trust that your wallet or blockexplorers are showing you correct transactions).  
It also ensures that you don't leak privacy to third parties. A wallet can spy on you and collect informations about your transactions, which it cannot do if you run your own node (provided you use a legit, open source wallet in the first place).  
Having a node also gives you something like a voice in the overall bitcoin system. This point is often misunderstood, as the system is not a democracy, but more of anarchy ("rules, but no rulers"). It helps you to become sovereign participant in the network without trusting others to validate the network rules on your behalf.

More people who **use** their nodes (connecting their wallets to it) = generally better for network overall, yes. It is also an indication that it is not too costly/hard to run a full node (if it's too costly, the network is in danger of centralisation).   
But simply spinning up a node does not contribute to the network. It contributes to your own privacy/security. The network doesn't rely on altruism ;)

This doesn't work because everybody is doing the same (trying to earn btc + increase their hashrate), which makes the difficulty adjustment algorithm to go up. Mining is a fiercely competitive game and everybody is looking to be "better" (= have as much hashpower as possible) than the others.
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:24:11
Better to take things slowly if you are only starting out.  
It's ok to use the default Ledger Live software, if you have no idea about nodes etc. Using their software has some disadvantages, mostly in regards to your privacy (they are able to see all your transactions in your wallet, at least potentially... I'm not saying they're definitely spying on you or something). You also have to trust them in other regards. So at some point I strongly recommend looking into how to run (and use) your own node with your hardware wallet.  
But for now, using Ledger + Ledger Live is better than leaving coins on an exchange. First steps first.

Ah I see now what you mean. No, I'm not sure in this regard. My knowledge stems mostly from the wiki itself and some google searches.  
But wouldn't it be possible to take any random nonce? I guess perhaps not, because you would need to hit a particular difficulty with the blockhash (as the quote from the wiki indicates). In this case, you would be right that the nonce would have to be "bruteforced", even though it should have been very easy, given the level of difficulty. But you would be right in this case :)  
But ultimately, I don't know. Good question :)

Yes, but not necessarily directly (it can be connected to a node that is connected to a node that is connected to a node that is connected to Bitfinex).

I'm not arguing that there are no transaction fees :)  
I'm saying that the transaction fees vary substantially depending on the transaction size (in bytes), your time preference and the current mempool. Saying "the current transaction fee is X" is misleading, because X can vary substantially depending on what exactly you are doing/trying to do.

No, that's a bit more complicated than that. The 51% threshold doesn't matter here. Consensus critical changes need to be implemented by other participants of the overall systems, otherwise the 51% of miners will simply mine an incompatible chain and lose **a lot** of money, also potentially causing some disruption and devaluation of their hardware investment.  
F.ex, 85% of miners were signaling for SegWit2X fork, but they backed out of it because nobody else was interested in it, so it got called off (despite having such a large majority of miners showing their support).

Simplified:  
Seed -&gt; private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address.  
A public key is derived from the private key. An address is derived from the public key. You can derive a practically infinite amount of addresses. They are all controlled by the same private key.  
Whoever controls the private key, controls all the funds on all the addresses derived from that key.  


It depends on the transaction(s) which led to you having 5 btc. If someone send you 5 btc in one single transaction, you have them all sitting on one single address. If you accumulated these 5 btc over a time period from multiple sources, it's likely that they are all sitting on different addresses (if you were a good bitcoiner and didn't reuse addresses). But it doesn't matter all that much, those coins are all controlled by the same private key (which you should keep as safe as possible for that reason).

The problem here is not the 2FA itself, but the fact that you are trusting blockchain,com with your funds. This might be ok for small amounts, but I certainly would not store any meaningful amounts there.  
In my understanding, most (if not all) wallets that allow 2FA are so called "web wallets", which have their own sets of risks (mainly, that you have to trust their maintainers not to get hacked and not to run away with your funds).  
Tbh, I am not really knowledgeable which wallets offer 2FA, as I would recommend storing your bitcoin on a wallet that offers more sovereignty than a web wallet.

You could also argue that if someone was indeed close to getting a QC done (which is a big "if" anyway), revealing their hand by stealing bitcoin is actually not that desirable because there might be other, more valuable honeypots (and if you stole very large amounts of bitcoin it would get noticed immediately - as people f.ex are watching satoshi's coins very closely - and crash the price, so your theft would be mostly unrewarded).

There were **tons** of blocksize debates during the last years. Not keen to rehash the arguments, but just briefly:  
- SegWit *was* a blocksize increase  
- a drastic change in the protocol such as blocksize increase requires consensus which doesn't seem to come about, because such a change requires some fundamental trade offs which most users of bitcoin are not willing to make  
- have you tried to sync a node recently (with less than great bandwidth)?

This doesn't really matter much. You, the user, can edit the code whichever way you like and run whatever code you wish. You don't need it approved or signed by anyone.

Bitcoin has already replaced (or is about to) fiat in many ways for those who want it. If you don't want that or are not yet able to, you either have to smarten up or wait until it becomes easier to use (which it already has and will continue to do).  
Bitcoin will not completely replace fiat for the average human being any time soon. It's a voluntary system and you are free to use it any way you like. It gives you a certain degree of freedom/sovereignty, with which comes a certain degree of responsibility. It's totally fine to not want that. But plenty of people do :)

I think this is a very reasonable standpoint, fwiw.  
Every popular social media tends to magnify groups with extreme views (in every direction), so it's easy to mistake such views as something that has broader consensus. Beware of this effect :) Especially on Twitter with its very limited communication space, where subtleties and discussion depth are left out very frequently (saying this as a big Twitter fan myself).
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:30:39
Because when a block is found, miners don't stop and wait until more transactions show up. Miners continue to mine, and it's entirely possible that some miner finds a block right after the previous block was mined. In this time there might not be enough transactions from users to fill this new block, that's why there are sometimes empty blocks.  
Edit: if you look up the previous block (before your linked one), it was mined one minute before the block in question.

The development platform will change and a new set of maintainers will emerge from the current developers, just as the current set of maintainers emerged previously. These things are not really formalized, it's more of an natural, developing, meritocratic process. The maintainer function is only a janitorial one, it is not authoritative in any way btw.   
Just as evolution is an adaptive, emerging process, so is open source development (sorry for a somewhat hyperbolic analogy). It adapts to the environment and depending on what caused such a drastic change (maintainers dead/imprisoned), it will adapt and continue under these new, adversarial circumstances.

It's not an opinion. Your wallet **needs** to connect to a node to broadcast an outgoing transaction or to verify an incoming one. This leaks certain data to the node the wallet is connecting to. There is absolutely no way around that.  
Re: 2, 3 and 4: your arguments amount to "eh, it's gonna be fine, the rest of the space will take care of that". While i am saying that you don't have to trust "the rest of the space", you can take the matters into your own hands and use your own node :)

If that person gets in trouble with the law, especially with money related stuff (money laundering, selling illegal stuff, tax issues etc), guess what happens to people who have bank transactions with that person?

There is no such thing as **the** transaction fee. All my last transactions costed something around 200 sats each, which is less than one cent! I was okay with waiting for hours or days if needed though, and my transactions were small in size (one input, one output), as well as being Segwit transactions.  
If you have more complex (multiple inputs/outputs), non-Segwit transactions that are urgent, you probably will pay more than 25 cents. It all depends on the details and your time preference.

The difficulty adjustment mechanism is responsible for regulating the time between blocks averaging out to 10 minutes, so you can calculate the hashrate (not precisely, but "close enough") by knowing the current difficulty and the current time between the blocks.

Read this great explainer by P. Wuille below. Not mentioned in the text are the privacy benefits, which I personally consider as important as the other arguments. When using a wallet without connecting it to your own node, the wallet queries the default nodes of the wallet, leaking sensitive information about your transactions.  
Other reasons:

Your confusion might be caused by the terminology (which admittedly might be confusing to a newcomer).  
Consider your Trezor to be more of a key manager instead of a wallet. It stores your key and can derive addresses from that key for you. You just click "receive" and it derives a new address. But it needs the private key to do that. It's just that you don't interact with this private key manually (except when backing it up/restoring it in form of the 24 words).  
You absolutely need to take good care of that 24 words seed phrase, by the way. This is essentially your private key, but expressed in a more human readable form (instead of a long sequence of numbers and letters).  


It's because handling the private key manually in order to send/receive transactions is a somewhat complicated process. The Trezor (remember, key manager!) makes this process much easier for you. But you could do the same thing by hand (although with much higher chances of screwing up something and losing your funds).

The problem with such things is that you don't know it before you put any funds on the wallet (except if you or someone you trust inspect the code on your own) ;)  
It's also possible that a site like this starts with being legit and then changes code into malicious one, after gaining some reputation and popularity.  
In short, I wouldn't trust any "wallet generator" sites from the web, except perhaps for experimental reasons with minimal amounts. Definitely not with long-term storage funds (with the exception if you understand the code **and** are able to execute it on a secure, offline machine).

Miners are not needed to verify transactions. They **mine** (confirm) transactions. Verification is something different (it just means checking if the transactions are valid or not), and bitcoin users can do that with their own full node.   
After the subsidy (newly mined bitcoins) runs out, mining is supposed to be incentivized only by transaction fees. So the fees on-chain either need to be higher, or more transactions need to be fitted into a block, or the price of bitcoin needs to rise further. My guess it will be some sort of a combination of those three factors, but it's just a guess.  
Please use the search function, this question gets asked a lot and you'll probably find more interesting discussions/answers there :)

I have rejected Kraken's services for the same reason.  
If you want to buy without KYC formalities, you either have to use something like Bisq or HodlHodl (accepting some level of inconvenience), bitcoin ATMs (inconvenience + higher premium for privacy), buying in person (inconvenience, taking more time to find a seller) or earning bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-12-15 09:23:37


Correct, but if the hashrate disappears in proportion to the disappearing block subsidy, the security disappears too. There still would be miners to mine, but it would be much easier to attack the chain (esp when there is a lot of unused old mining hardware lying around somewhere).  
Btw, if we're back to CPU mining at that stage, something really awful would need to have happened ;)

This is the same advice you would get in any kind of r/personalfinance and similar subs, and for a good reasons when it comes to investments. Bitcoin is not much different here (albeit of course much more volatile at this point in time). Patience is a virtue, and there is no free lunch anywhere. Although "buy low" is useless for a long-term investment because it's impossible to really time the market. And "sell never" is of course more of a meme than a practical advice (it rather means "don't do short term trades").
Another way to "invest" is to put money into your own education, but tbh the best education on bitcoin is freely available anyway.   


If you are really looking into an educational project on a Raspberry, maybe consider setting up a bitcoin full node, like this:  Tbh, I'm not sure if you find it interesting without having any exposure to bitcoin first, but for me personally it was a great project to learn more how bitcoin works on the protocol level (and also this gives you a much higher level of privacy when it comes to bitcoin transactions).

@_date: 2019-12-19 12:45:34
Both "predictions" are only estimations. You cannot predict this precisely because hashrate is neither static nor known at any point in time (the overall hashrate on the network is an estimate as well). And the exact date of the halving depends on how much hashrate is being deployed before that date.

Nobody is forced. You are free to choose. You can use your own node if you choose to do so. Requiring a bit of effort and learning is not "forcing".

In a world where better phones come out every ~2 years, why buy one today if you could buy a better one in the future?  
Also, over time (with higher liquidity and "maturity") bitcoin's volatility and price rise will inevitably slow down, so the holders in our hypothetical world scenario will want to spread out their investments into other areas that either promising higher growths or offer other payoffs, be it material ones or more intrinsic/ideologic ones.

This doesn't matter. There are no "exchange logs" because you can do coinjoins trustlessly, without any third party know what outputs belong to which inputs.  


Yes, if you input 1.23456 btc into a coinjoin and then transfer exactly 1.23456 btc out of a coinjoin, of course it's easy to make a link between those two. This is easily mitigated by various techniques (same sized outputs, transferring differently sized outputs over time etc). But yes, user side errors are always the weakest point. 


Please answer my question above (how to connect one of 100 outputs to one of the 100 inputs, esp if they've gone through multiple mixing rounds).

You can donate to some of the devs individually (afaik Luke Dashjr has a Patreon page, and Sjoors Provost has a donation page, f.ex), and to various projects, but since there is no formal membership or a formal "bitcoin dev" organization, there can be no collective entity you can donate to.

Nice to hear you read and understood the importancy of it :) I also suggest looking into using your own full node, so you are not reliable on nodes of your (hardware) wallet creator. This further increases your privacy.  


Keep in mind that I am talking purely theoretical here, and not about a specific proposal. Perhaps there will be one that avoids this fundamental trade off somehow, but for now it looks like it will be a series of incremental implementations improving partial aspects, as well as tools on the user's side (like Wasabi etc).

Read this great explainer by P. Wuille below.  
Not mentioned in the text are the privacy benefits, which I personally consider as important as the other arguments. When using a wallet without connecting it to your own node, the wallet queries the default nodes of the wallet, leaking sensitive information about your transactions.

Can't really disagree here. Coinjoin is not a privacy panacea and all three currently existing implementations (Joinmarket, Wasabi, Whirlpool) have all their weaknesses somewhere.  
However, especially combined with the avoidance of KYC-complying services (and other good practices), I think coinjoin is pretty powerful in practice, at least it's infinitely better than not doing coinjoin at all.  
Sure, it requires effort and education at the current point in time, but tbh so does bitcoin itself, especially for "advanced" usecases.
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:40:25


"Hodling" (as in "saving") **is** using. But of course it's also essential to build up the infrastructure for people to use bitcoin by other means (that's why everyone is so supportive of projects like BTCPayserver, Bitrefill and other btc-dedicated merchants).

*edit: posted in the wrong thread, was intended to be posted here:  but leaving it up here for now, perhaps someone else will find this interesting, too :D*
The first version(s) of the Bitcoin software needed other peers in order to start mining, so Satoshi most likely wasn't mining alone. Although this is something that is difficult to prove (he could after all use multiple nodes), he ensured that everyone interested could mine right from the start by announcing the release two months in advance and introducing a single-click mining feature in the software. Also, there was 8 hours time passed between the [genesis block]( and the [first block]( mined (indicating that Satoshi didn't simply turned on his mining node just to race to mine as much as possible for himself).    
The evidence of how much he mined is also not robust, but somewhat reasonable to assume that he generated [around 700,000 btc](

The holiday season approaching fast, and with a very symbolical price mark to be broken soon potentially, I'm sure many of us will be asked about bitcoin by our families. Mostly about the price, but this can be used to bring in further explanations and discussions. Easiest way to introduce someone to bitcoin in a practical way is to to install a wallet and to send a transaction. Yes, I know, fees suck for lower amounts and the fees estimation algorhythms in wallets suck as well, but still better to have a tx wait for confirmations than to keep bitcoin purely theoretical.

You have a point but some challenges are more on the social side (misinformation, promotion of bad ideas, outright scams etc). You need to remember that stupid ideas can still find their way into the codebase (or other critical infrastructure) if bitcoiners are not vigilant enough.  
Also you have to remember that attacking someone's financial security/investment obviously incentivizes the person/group being under attack (real or imagined, actual or potential) to fight back. That's why bitcoin space can seem so fierce. But (at least partially) it also acts as a defence mechanism against many different attack types.

Ok, so is it fair to say then that the more a thing is necessary to sustain a human's life, the more inherent value it has?  
Independent of that: my life has value to me, but not necessarily to other people. To someone else, my life might have an inherent value of 0, or even below that (if they think that my existence detriments theirs in some ways). So what's the true inherent value of my life, or human's life in general? Is this established by society as a whole?

It depends on where you run your node (Raspberry Pi? Desktop/laptop? Which OS?).  
In general, to connect your hardware wallet to your node you'll need Electrum Personal Server (or Electrs or ElectrumX), and Electrum wallet itself (instead of your hardware wallet's default software).  
So it goes like this: Node &lt;-&gt; Electrum Personal Server &lt;-&gt; Electrum &lt;-&gt; Hardware wallet.  
Setting up Electrum is super easy. Setting up Electrum Personal Server is more tricky, you need to do that with command line and tinker around with the config file.  
Software wallets are another thing, as most of them don't allow to connect to your own node in the first place.

There were **tons** of blocksize debates during the last years. Not keen to rehash the arguments, but just briefly:  
- SegWit *was* a blocksize increase  
- a drastic change in the protocol such as blocksize increase requires consensus which doesn't seem to come about, because such a change requires some fundamental trade offs which most users of bitcoin are not willing to make  
- have you tried to sync a node recently (with less than great bandwidth)?

Because 99% of them are either a bad investment or an outright scam and you won't be able to pick the 1% as a beginner (and even if by luck you do, it still will likely be a worse investment for a long-term hold than bitcoin).  


The difference is that a hardware wallet keeps your private keys offline at all times. Simplified it means: you could use a hardware wallet even with a malware/spyware infested computer and not lose any money, while with a software wallet (desktop, smartphone) you are likely to lose money. This is of course depends on the type of malware and the level of your own vigilance, computer security etc. But a hardware wallet is a must for larger amounts.

Well, if all funds are on your side, how do you expect incoming transactions to happen? :)  
You need to get some funds on the other side (without gifting them the money, obviously). You can do this by simply buying something (bitrefill etc), or sending a lightning payment for an on-chain transaction back (like sending to an exchange, service or another wallet over LN and withdrawing on-chain). There probably other more smart solutions but I haven't been thinking about channel balancing for the last while.  
Here's a great video on channel management for routing nodes, it's a little older but I think the main principles still hold: 
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:35:10
To be technical, you cannot *use* bitcoin without a full node ;)  
If you don't have one yourself, you are using someone else's node and have to trust this entity to feed you correct data. Or give them the power to decide what is "bitcoin" in case of a contentious hardfork. Also you trust this entity with your information (transactions can be linked to your IP f.ex).
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:09:11
Yep! But not "the last block", more the last *x* number of blocks (because there is a lot of variance involved: one block could take 1 minutes to be found and the next one 30 minutes, even if the hashrate didn't change at all in the meantime.. just due to mathematical variance).

I don't see how a cryptocurrency would bridge the gap between the conflicting incentives of social media sites (gathering data) and of users (staying private)?

There's a bit more subtleties to that.  
The competitive nature of mining definitely seems to have some centralization pressure (decentralized systems are inherently less efficient than centralized ones). F.ex the race to produce more efficient hardware leaves out less competitive hardware manufacturers.  
But the fact that mining and hardware production is itself open to competition and is inherently permissionless serves as some kind of counterbalance against the centralization pressure. New producers and new miners can enter the competition without needing permission (of course in real world it also depends on jurisdiction and resources scarcity).  
Also you have to consider what the alternative is: a less open, less secure overall system. So while mining centralization is definitely not something desirable, I think it is still sufficiently decentralized (see also Stratum v2 protocol which contributes to further decentralization) and the "bad" side of mining seems to be a necessary trade off for the security it provides.
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:28:45
No, a block hash needs to incorporate the hash of the previous block (hence the name *blockchain* in the first place). The genesis block doesn't have a previous block. It is hardcoded into the software.  


@_date: 2019-04-19 17:01:41
The 24 words phrase that the wallet gives you **is** actually the private key, just in a human-friendly format. The "raw" private key format is a long string of characters, looking something like that: E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262 (do not import this key in your wallet and if you do, delete it immediately so you don't send money to it by accident!). It can be expressed in a variety of ways, like f.ex in a 24 word phrase (using a specific algorithm and a pre-defined list of words).

This just delegates trust to another party instead of the bitcoin merchant, so it doesn't solve anything. It actually introduces more complexity and decreases privacy (because it either requires address reusage or knowledge of all the addresses the merchant will ever use, i.e his pubkey).

My hopes are on the upcoming HWI (Hardware Wallet Integration) feature of Bitcoin Core as well as efforts of various wallet's devs to make it easier for the user to connect to their own node.

No, there are no guarantees if you don't know what you're doing. If you combine coinjoined outputs with "KYC-outputs" (UTXOs which a third party can link to your identity), you potentially undo the coinjoin advantages.

They didn't know. They assumed it based on the user's previous withdrawals (because those previous withdrawals ended up directly in a Wasabi mix). It's not possible to know which wallet an address has been generated with (assuming you haven't been reusing addresses).

You need to use your own full node for that. This is a little more complicated and requires some effort to set up and use with a Trezor.  
One option (disregard the Lightning part):  - It's all free (you need to buy your own hardware though) and open source. 
Another option:  - not very familiar with them, they cost money but probably this is a bit more beginner friendly.

I agree here and would never discourage anyone to run a node, even if it stays without a connection to user's wallet. I know from my own experience that it just takes a whole to figure out and set up everything, and it's better to have a node already up and running when you need it :)  
I also think that perhaps running such "dummy" nodes also might increase privacy for other nodes, just by obscurity (higher numbers of nodes = more data to analyse for tracking companies)?  
Having said all that, I see a lot of people wanting to run a node "to help the network". My point is that a node ran for this reason alone is not very helpful, if the user doesn't use it with their own wallet. It's not the primary function of a node to be an altruistic piece of the network (but the network becomes more solid, as more people validate their own transactions, as you pointed out).

Ah, I think I get what you mean.  
Yes, running a node gives some level of protection against "abusing" of hashpower. F.ex if 60% of hashing power introduces some kind of incompatible protocol rule change (hardfork), your wallet provider might follow this rule change for whatever reason and you will be forced to accept this change. While when using the same wallet with your own node, you will stay on the current chain but have the option to change to the new chain if you desire so.  
This means indeed that you are better protected by using your own node in such a scenario.

It's not. Hashpower has to conform to consensus rules, otherwise its "power" is meaningless and will mine worthless altcoins.  
F.ex, if something like 80% of bitcoin miners suddenly start mining incompatible blocks (blocks over accepted size limit, blocks including doublespent coins etc), their work would simply be rejected by the rest of the network and those miners would let all of their electricity and hardware go to waste.  
Miners don't decide consensus, they have to confirm to it (although miners do play a role in the overall consensus, of course).

This depends on what particularly you are concerned about.. Is it time sensitive? Does someone know the amount of btc you hold (this won't be helped much by coinjoin, probably)? etc   
If it's not time sensitive, I would try to read up as much as possible on what coinjoin and coincontrol are and how UTXOs work on the basic level. Because "coinjoin" is not some magic pill you can take and the currently existing implementations (Wasabi, Joinmarket, Whirlpool) have their trade offs and disadvantages. Also, you can screw up your privacy post- or pre-mix somewhere (although you probably won't make things worse than without mixing at all, just reversing the mixing, so going back to where you were before coinjoin). And perhaps simply try one of the coinjoin implementations, until you understand more how it works.  
I collected some resources here, so perhaps a good place to start reading:

It's somewhat beginner friendly, I would say, esp. if you are already somewhat familiar with how bitcoin transactions, private keys, seed phrases (backup) work on a basic level. I would recommend to practice deleting and restoring your backup with a hardware wallet, before storing larger amounts on them, just to get the gist of the basics.  


Most of them have their own software, but you can also use them with Electrum (or other wallets like Wasabi) instead.
@_date: 2019-12-10 12:03:41


No, you can transfer back to the same wallet, but be careful not to reuse addresses and not to send all the funds back at the same time (if you sent 1.258 btc to Wasabi, mixed them, and then transferred back 1.257 btc, it's easy to make the connection between those coins for any observer).

You can setup Tor on a node which has been previously running on clearnet, and that node then receives a new onion address, which is not related to the previous clearnet IP address (the "old" node basically disappears from the network). So as I understand things, it's ok to upgrade your node with Tor at some later point, but depending on your paranoia/privacy concerns you might want to consider never setting up a clearnet node in the first place.

A big point to use your own node in the first place is mostly not mentioned in such articles for some reason: it protects your privacy. By default, a bitcoin wallet connects to third party nodes, which are able to collect and track some sensitive information (your transaction data, clustering your UTXOs etc).  
By connecting a wallet to your own node, you don't leak such information anywhere. Everything is going through your own node. Plus you don't have to trust third parties to tell you if your incoming bitcoin transaction is valid or not (= to tell you if you hold any bitcoin at all).
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:05:24
That's informative, thank you!  (tagging u/fresheneesz so he doesn't miss the reply)  
What do you think about the increased privacy argument (= people running unused nodes contributing to better privacy of other participants, i.e. obscurity by numbers)? Does this hold any merit? By "unused nodes" I mean those that are not connected to an actual wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:41:37


Yes, it has value to you, not to the network :)   


Not really. The bottleneck is almost always the verification that needs to happen locally when downloading/verifying blocks. Having a few milliseconds faster download times (although I don't actually know how much it is, perhaps not even that much) because a node is nearby geographically does not help in this context.  
The point on marginal redundancy is true, but we're long past the point where new, unused nodes help here (there are currently 50-60k nodes on the network already).
@_date: 2019-12-29 12:10:30
Since such threads almost always invoke comments "what is a node for" (which is a good thing, questions should be encouraged!), I'm going to go ahead and post an answer in advance.  
A node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from "fake" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's default nodes, f.ex).  
Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't mention the privacy aspect, which is imo as important as the trust aspect):

Some of the valuable properties in no particular order:  
- highly divisible 
- highly portable (try to take larger amounts of cash or gold across borders, or transfer your savings to a foreign bank) 
- censorship resistant (no trusted third parties required)  
- difficult to confiscate by third parties 
- provably scarce with a clear, immutable emission schedule
- total current supply is easily verifiable 
- every transaction is easily verifiable 
- permissionless 
- borderless 
- open source (no single entity in control of the code, critical changes cannot make it into the code without consensus) . 
What makes bitcoin unique is that a lot of these properties cannot be simply copied, and neither can they emerge from scratch when the incentives for founders to enrich themselves in various ways (premines, "developer grants", some particular mining algorithms that might benefit their mining buddies etc etc) are so large, and when regulators are more aware of the space in general nowadays.  
Considering these factors, bitcoin's inception was unique because it allowed it to develop without attention from state actors and various other potentially malevolent players and because its founder doesn't seem to have been motivated by money/fame and gave the community the generous gift of disappearing without cashing out or continuing to use his authority in whatever way.

If you ever thought about setting up a node but didn't want to run it on your laptop/desktop (because it would interfere with your work), or didn't know how to connect your hardware wallet to it, or were worried about your privacy... Or just wanted to learn how bitcoin works on a more technical level - I really can recommend this guide.  
It requires buying a hardware (Raspberry Pi + external HDD) which comes at about $150 (this is half the cost you would pay for a Casa node, which has essentially the exact same hardware). It also involves installing over command line, but most of the time you can simply copypaste commands.  
You will have a node that you can use with your hardware wallet (instead of leaking privacy to third party nodes), run Lightning, or install additional software like Joinmarket. And everything on Tor by default!  
Thanks Stadicus :)

No, a hardfork is implementing new rules that are incompatible with old rules (speaking broadly). Halving has been in the code since the beginning (halving the number of newly minted coins every 210,000 of blocks), so no new rules are necessary.

Isn't this some kind of "chicken and egg" problem? I.e: what comes first, the impulsive consumption (resulting in an inflationary currency), or an inflationary currency (resulting in impulsive consumption)?  
I guess it's a mix of both, as so often. But probably we should be avoiding the (probably faulty) conclusion of "the reason we have inflationary currency is that it suites human nature the most".
@_date: 2019-12-19 10:59:38
Coinjoin is obviously not an infallible solution, because there are plenty of ways a user can screw up pre- and postmix, but having something like multiple rounds of 20 inputs/20 outputs *does* add more to privacy (protecting from analysis from third party observers) than having 1 input/1 output transactions :)
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:28:59
Every wallet that is using the wallet's nodes is able to track your transactions. You need to connect the wallet to your own node in order to avoid this privacy leak.  
For this, you need to look up a set up guide how to run a node, and set up Electrum Personal Server on that node. It's a bit of a clunky process at the moment, but hopefully it'll get better when Bitcoin Core implements hardware wallet integration directly.

2016 was the year in which the whitepaper was written.. You don't go from whitepaper to a "finished" product within a year or two in a complex open source software with multiple implementations. There is also no "finished" stage for such a software for a long while, as it's in constant development, just as bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-12-19 13:31:22
My understanding is that there is the secure element which is the closed source part of the hardware, but all the software components are open source. I wasn't aware that the secure element came with some closed source software as well, but the details are beyond my level of expertise anyway :)  
Probably it actually doesn't matter that much, because it would be logically inconsistent to accept the closed source nature of the secure element but taking an issue if it came with closed source code. If one trusts Ledger with the secure element, one as well might accept the trust risks for the software linked to it.  
But yeah, in my understanding the software is open source but I haven't dug too deeply here.  
Probably u/btchip is a better person to ask.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:59:41


No. It's not possible to change the rules of bitcoin only with hashpower. 


You need to understand that in order to be a miner, you need to be heavily invested in bitcoin in the first place (because your hardware is expensive and all it can do is to mine bitcoin). So in order to start an attack you will have to devalue your hardware investment (and other operational investments) potentially all the way down to zero. As well as your reputation etc.  
This is all even not taking into consideration the practical issues of acquiring (and running/maintaining) a huge swat of mining equipment in the first place.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:46:59
It's a little more subtle than that.  
The more people independently verify their own transactions, the "healthier" the network is overall (as there are less opportunities for malicious player to wreck havoc). So the node count is a metric that gives us some indication how "healthy", how decentralized the network is. But a node is only meaningful if it is actually used for verifying transactions (even if it's every once in a while, or in a potential future). Simply having a lot of nodes that just sit there and do nothing does not contribute to the health of the network in a meaningful way.   
New nodes that are just starting need other nodes to download older blocks from, but for that purpose there are already "enough" nodes on the network (I would think, at least). So while your node adds some kind of redundancy, it doesn't really help that much if it's not used otherwise. Its primary purpose is to help **you**, not the network :)  
re: benefits of using a node for your hardware wallet:  
You verify all the incoming transactions yourself (well, your node does that). Otherwise you are relying on the node of the hardware wallet developers to verify for you. Also, you leak privacy to their node: they can spy which transactions you are interested in (because your wallet asks their node for specific tx's etc) and can link your transactions together etc.  
Not to say that the developers of your hardware wallet do that, but you have to trust them that they don't. Using your own node for a wallet (hardware or otherwise) mitigates that risk .

The design choices made in bitcoin lead to properties like censorship resistance, open source, permissionless, trust-minimzed and so on. All these work just fine without the price being absolutely flat.  
Volatility has actually something good, too: you cannot go from value of $0 to value of $X without volatility, simply because people don't know how to value such an asset. Adding to that, there are still many uncertainties regarding bitcoins future (although less now than there were ten years ago, which is also reflected in the higher price).

Well, you have to understand that all you have on Skrill is a number, pegged to bitcoin's price, and a premium is applied on that number, too.

Fwiw, I think Skrill is going down the drain slowly. They're ramping up fees (for bank withdrawals, transaction fees), as well as introducing inactivity fees just recently, and so on. I don't think they will stay compatible in the upcoming years. But that's just my opinion.

Just a word of caution: treat such sites as malicious, until you are reasonably certain that they're not. Also, treat your "secret" address as not so secret anymore and don't put any money on it (because it is created by a possibly malicious site and because you already typed it in into another site) ;)  
I don't know why the "receive" address isn't found, but probably because there are no funds on it. The "secret" address is probably the private key, and under no circumstances should you share this private key with anyone (including any kind of website or other service/device).

I think this would largely depend on how the hell all the maintainers managed to die/get imprisoned at the same time :)  if this was a consequence of some state actor's actions f.ex, there would be a need for a platform that is beyond such actor's reach.  
I don't have any doubt that in such an extraordinary (and unrealistic) situation the other developers' goal would be  to avoid any further fragmentation of the development work and converge on a new platform quickly. F.ex there is already a mirrored Bitcoin core repository on a Tor hidden service (although it's more of a backup than an alternative platform):

adding to that, the only disadvantage that bc1 has today is that some exchanges (looking at you, Bitstamp) don't recognize this address format yet. Most exchanges and wallets do though, and it has a few advantages to use those addresses (less error prone, more savings in fees).  
In any case, you won't do anything wrong by using either of the address formats. There is no "wrong" one. Both are controlled by your own private keys ;)
@_date: 2019-12-22 10:56:55
This question is tricky to answer. A large chunk of the post is about Lightning, which has a throughput of magnitudes higher than the on-chain protocol. And while it doesn't influence the TPS on-chain directly, it takes some of the "working load" off the chain (by transferring usecases like micropayments and instant payments on the layer above the on-chain).  
The Schnorr/Taproot improvements do influence the throughput (scalability) on-chain directly, by making certain kinds of transactions much smaller. How this will influence the TPS number, I don't know though (I doubt it's possible to calculate anyway, esp given that the proposals are still "under construction" and because the TPS number is not a fixed variable but depends on different factors, i.e which type of addresses are used in transactions, what types of transactions are we talking about and so on).

Decentralization is not the point. It's just a necessary feature to achieve a single point of failure and censorship-resistance.   


Security: amount of energy/hardware required to attack the network is much higher than other coins; amount of eyes on code looking for bugs is higher than in other coins; hashpower, amount of users running nodes etc etc  
Also things like network effects, [Lindy effect]( "immaculate inception", longest running project etc etc.  
There are also technical things but it's tough to explain in a short format and I don't have enough knowledge to go in depth anyway. But bitcoin development (on the base protocol level) always emphasizes security and stability first. And while it shuts out wild experiments and "move fast and break things" mentality, this is exactly what a "sound money" project should be like, at least for me personally. Experiments can be run on other projects.
@_date: 2019-12-13 07:53:19


A custodial wallet typically doesn't give you the option to connect it to your own node. It wouldn't make sense anyway: even if you do connect it, you still have to trust the custodian with your money and your privacy, so your node doesn't do anything for you in this case.  
Btw "connecting to a node" means here that you basically tell your wallet  to "monitor" for transactions on the blockchain that is stored on **your** node. By default a wallet connects to the nodes of the wallets developers (f.ex Ledger wallet conects to Ledger nodes, Samourai wallet connects to nodes run by Samourai and so forth).
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:58:51


Why are we talking about security all of a sudden?  


Bad analogy, imo. There are no actual coins (or cards, or other "physical" objects where such an analogy would be suitable) on the bitcoin network. There are UTXOs which get "melted" and "reforged" with each new transaction.  
Perhaps a better analogy would be gold bars. Sure, if you shuffle around goldbars you still have the same goldbars in the end (same shape, same weight, same stamps etc). However, if you melt them down and re-cast them into a new bar (or coin, or whatever), it's a wholly different thing. This is a bit closer to what a coinjoin does. Although of course every analogy has its flaws.

I'm not sure what "coinmine" or "1 click installers" are, but I can guarantee you that both are unprofitable in the best case, and scam/malware in the worst case. The same goes for 100% of cloud mining (or whatever else "outsourced" kind of mining offers) you come across the internet.
@_date: 2019-12-08 13:26:08
Currently the channel capacity is by default 0.16 bitcoin (and I think there is also a max payment limit, I don't remember how high though). It's not "hardwired" in the protocol though, so if you want to have more than that in a channel, you just need to tweak the code yourself a little and have a channel partner who has the same/similar tweak, so you both can create a channel with a higher capacity than 0.16 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:04:09
A proper wallet (= open source, free software) does not have any age restrictions, because it does not know your age, your gender, your location and your identity in general.  
You are confusing a wallet with an exchange though. An exchange (where you can exchange fiat money for bitcoin) needs to know your identity, your age and so on.  
You can simply download a wallet without giving any information whatsoever (and be highly sceptical if a service asks you for such information). Buying bitcoin without ID requires some effort though. Try using the search here with something like "bitcoin as minor" or similar, there were a lot of questions like yours in the past.
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:00:41
Well, I agree that it's a problem. It's a hard problem though, because bitcoin needs to be transparent in order for the users to be able to verify to total coin supply and the validity of transactions on their own, without needing to ask any third party. Complete anonymity would make this impossible (or introduce a whole another set of difficulties), so there is a fundamental trade off between "total anonymity" and "trustlesness" (or "verifiability", not sure which word to put here).  
So for now, coinjoin, coincontrol and using your own node are the best tools available for privacy (or just avoiding KYC services in general). 2nd layer solutions such as Lightning (or off-chain transaction methods in general) are also an option.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:09:27


I can put up a malware on GitHub and as long as it stays under the radar nobody would report issues with it.  


In the worst case, you could import your backup (the 24 words) onto another device (from a different manufacturer), or just to a software wallet (such as Electrum). Your seed is not "hardwired" to a particular device.  


You can write down as many copies of the seed phrase from the hardware wallet as you like ;) You can even throw away the hardware wallet afterwards and be completely fine (not that it accomplishes something anyway, just to make a point that you are not bound to the device itself, as long as you have the backup phrase).  
You could use something like Coldcard that creates your seed offline and has open source hardware and software. And it's a popular device in the space, meaning that a lot of people looked over the code.
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:38:46
You are rightly concerned. It is crucial to use an open source wallet for that reason (and also to write down the derivation path, when you create a seed). "Proprietary algorithm" for seed creation is highly likely to be some kind of a scam anyway.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:00:58
I would be strongly sceptical against anything that has "blockchain" in its title/pitch and wants to have money from you. A "blockchain" is simply a very particular, clunky way to structure data, there is nothing magical about it, although it usually gets pitched together with buzzwords like "decentralized", "permissionless", "innovative", "borderless" and all that.  
But it's not "the blockchain" that enables f.ex bitcoin to have all these properties: it's cryptography, PoW, economical incentives, very particular trade-offs in design (giving up efficiency to gain security etc), and open source development.  
Please be aware of such buzzword-y things. I'm not sure what else to recommend except not being too quick to jump into this "blockchain" thing. Perhaps this article will offer some more insight:   
This one is good also:

Because transactions are on the blockchain forever, and if you have personally identifiable information linked to some of those transactions.. well, it stays "out there" forever.

No, because how would you force someone to pay a higher fee? And what would be the way to discern which transactions deserve a lower fee, and which higher? You'd need to introduce some sort of central planning committee for that, and it (probably) would trivially easy to circumvent it anyway.

Make absolutely sure that he (or you) has the 24 words seed! Firmware updates can be dangerous, especially if the device hasn't been updated for so long.  
IIRC you have to probably install at least one update before doing the most current one. In the worst case you might not even be able to update at all (in that case Ledger probably will replace your device), but I am not an expert.  
Again, it's crucial to have the 24 word phrase in case the device bricks.
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:58:05
A project being "open source" doesn't guarantee anything when there is nobody who is actually checking the code. A scam software can be completely open source. If you (or someone you trust, or at least a bunch of independent people) don't check the code, you won't know if an open source software is legit or not.  


This doesn't matter if the seed generator of the software is flawed (= not random "enough").  
I'm not saying the software is a scam (I haven't checked the code), but I want to point out that "open source" is not a guarantee for not being a scam, and generating offline is not a guarantee for your private keys being leaked.  


I would use a hardware wallet tbh. You still would have the same concerns as above, but you would at least know that plenty of people have looked over their code and the reputation of the hardware devices manufacturers is at stake (as opposed to a completely random internet page...).

You can't control bitcoin (in regards to bitcoin, the protocol/software) if you own a lot of it though. You also cannot control bitcoin's issuance.

Yes, that's correct. I should have said "to have the same or better level of security as today". But you are of course right: it's not that mining will stop if none of those three things happens (difficulty adjustment is one of the genius things about bitcoin), but there will be much less security.

it's a software which verifies transactions and blocks on the bitcoin network. Basically, when you receive bitcoin, you can ask your node if the transaction is valid.   
The easiest way to run a node is to download the [Bitcoin Core software]( and let it sync. You can run it on your laptop/desktop or on a dedicated hardware device (f.ex a cheap mini-computer like a Raspberry Pi, see [this guide](

The configuration is totally up to you (although I am not entirely sure what your definitions of "public" and "private" are in this context). You can also run a node through Tor. But this is all details, it doesn't matter much for the actual purpose of the node.

There is no essential difference between LN and "regular" bitcoin. Both **are** bitcoin.  
To transact on LN you just need a LN compatible wallet, send some bitcoin to it and open a channel. Which wallet to choose depends on your system (desktop/phone? which OS?).  
Zap is a good option for iOS, Eclair for Android. Breeze or Bluewallet seem like good options, too. Not sure what people are using on desktops nowadays preferably.

From my experience, when politicians/bankers talk about "private digital currencies", they don't mean it the way a bitcoiner would mean it. They mean it more like "non-sovereign currency" (i.e., not issued by a state authority).

Congrats! Now try to figure out how to *use* it (connecting your wallet to it for better privacy of your transactions), or how to run it through Tor (also for privacy considerations), if you haven't already :)
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:46:17
I assume you treat "fungibility" synonymously with "privacy"? On the protocol level, there is already "perfect" (whatever this means) fungibility, because the only thing the protocol cares about is if a particular UTXO is valid or not.  
But when dealing with KYC/AML obliged services, it's on the user to care for their privacy, by practicing [coincontrol]( and using various coinjoin services like Wasabi, Whirlpool or Joinmarket. Or simply opting out of dealing with KYC/AML services in the first place.

@_date: 2019-12-24 12:34:09
This is not what a node is for. Setting your own fees is a standard function of every proper wallet nowadays.  
The function of a node is to be independent of third party nodes for checking if your (incoming) transactions are valid, and for maintaining a higher level of privacy on the network (not leaking sensitive information to third party nodes).

You probably should set up your own wallet and withdraw to it. Otherwise, you are implicitly trust CashApp with your coins. And even if you do trust them for the moment, it's still is a good practice to know how to set up a wallet, back it up etc.

@_date: 2019-12-26 17:41:18


This is similarly wrong as to say that bitcoin is private.  
The reality is more nuanced: if you buy bitcoin without going through KYC-compliant services and if you store/transact "properly" (i.e.: using your own node, practicing [coincontrol]( using coinjoin mechanisms such as Joinmarket, Wasabi or Whirlpool, don't use blockexplorers etc), you have quite a private asset. So privacy does cost a little of effort and education, but it's not rocket science either (and also "privacy" is not a binary, it's more a shade of grey and depends on what kind of privacy threats you are trying to protect yourself from).
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:36:47


That's correct. But as I understand it, every today's coinjoin implementation (Joinmarket, Whirlpool by Samourai) are also identifiable easily on the blockchain, so it's not only Wasabi's coinjoins.  


Simply withdrawing to another wallet first should mitigate this problem. Or not even to another wallet: you can withdraw to Wasabi, then make another internal transfer from one Wasabi address to another, and then initiate a coinjoin.  
Remember, it's not possible to recognize which wallet an address is originated from. No one can tell if a particular address is created by Wasabi, or Electrum, or Samourai, or Ledger or whatnot.
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:43:08
You don't know it by simply looking at the transaction info on the blockchain, but you could manually label every incoming transaction, f.ex (this is part of the coin control feature in the more advanced wallets). So every transaction you receive from an exchange you label "KYC" or something, and all other transactions with "non-KYC".  
Or you can just mix all of the transactions your receive with Wasabi before using them further (or mix only the "KYC"-labeled transactions to save on mixing fees etc).

@_date: 2019-12-27 17:42:30


Personally, I see is as some kind of "save haven" asset that is not subject to inflation and capital controls. "Safe" in quotes, because obviously there are uncertainties in bitcoin that are not present in fiat systems (and vice versa), and the majority of people wouldn't agree to the safe haven thesis. But that's why there is a premium as well in bitcoin (number go up); a much higher one when compared to something like savings account, gold, or even stocks.  
So there is certainly a speculation element as well (regarding the future price), although bitcoin's properties like censorship resistance, portability, "sendability", open source, divisibility etc etc are valuable for certain usecases already today, without the speculation part.  
Another thing is a payment mechanism which, although not as efficient as modern western fiat systems, still is useful in situations where those modern systems are not accessible or not a good option for various reasons (privacy, censorability, surveillance, micropayments).  
So bitcoin can be a mixture of "save haven", speculation and payment railway usecases, weighted in whichever way the user sees fit.

1) blocks are frequently over 1MB in size nowadays ;)   
2) I haven't done any in-depth research on that, but looking on that second graph it seems that the tx fees within one block are a bit higher than ~0.15 btc (you can see this buy looking at how low those spikes drop from their highest point). Not by much though, so compared to 12.5 btc newly mined each block, the tx fees are a small percentage of mining rewards currently.

I understand and share your sentiment about posting of tweets here in this sub, but that Ammous dude is actually worth a listen: 
@_date: 2019-12-02 11:32:02
It mostly depends what you want to use your node for. If it's only to verify your own bitcoin transactions (and have a higher level of privacy), you might do it on an old laptop/desktop (preferably one that you don't need for daily work, so you can leave it on for longer).   
You could set a node up on a dedicated cheap device such as a Raspberry Pi (~$50) that you can leave on 24/7. But it requires a bit of effort to set it up. F.ex this is a good beginner guide:   
You also could buy a pre-configured Raspberry Pi node for ~$200-300 (same hardware but you don't need to install everything on your own).  
In any case, it doesn't really depend on the amount of btc you own but on the level of effort and cost you are willing to spend.  
Of course, if you only ever will have some pocket change in bitcoin, it's probably not worth it (apart if you have fun tinkering with software/hardware and/or are curious to learn).

There is the Bitcoin protocol (without a formal specification/code) and the Bitcoin reference client, called Bitcoin Core. All of the code of Bitcoin Core is open source, meaning that anyone who wishes can look into it, copy it freely and make suggestions how to improve it. You can find all of the code here:   
This implies that you can print out the code as many times as you like :)  Note that it's not "THE bitcoin code", because there is none. There's only code of different protocol implementations, of which Bitcoin Core is the most popular one (but there are also Bitcoin Knots, Libbitcoin and some others).

You ask many questions, each of which requires quite a bit of explanations because they are not trivially easy to grasp for a beginner (or don't have easy/precise answers in the first place). Also, many of them are of sort that gets asked daily on this sub.   
In order to avoid trollish/flippant answers, I would recommend you to focus on 1-3 questions in one thread, and to try use the search function here or on google. Showing that you've done at least some basic research will be more likely to attract higher quality answers.  
I also can recommend you r/bitcoinbeginners for basic questions :)  
I'll address some of your questions.  


"Blockchain" is just an inefficient database by design. It is inefficient because it needs to make certain engineering trade offs in order to stay censorship resistant, permissionless and secure against all sorts of attacks. A limited blocksize is one of such engineering trade offs. Simply increasing it will have certain consequences (as well as tinkering with other variables will have certain consequences). Also, changing consensus rules is difficult in decentralized systems, because to change something critical, you need the vast majority of users to agree to it. Meaning, dangerous changes will not be able to make it into the codebase.  


It's wrong because even with the majority of hashpower (which China doesn't control btw. Please look up how mining pools work) cannot *destroy* the network. It can certainly disrupt it temporarily (but miners will make much more money by behaving as they are supposed to). Also, it's not to say that geographical/jurisdictional mining centralization is not a problem, but it is not a critically dangerous problem either.

No, the bitcoin on an exchange is on **their** private keys. When they send you the bitcoin, they send it to **your** private key, after which the transfer is irreversible. The exchange doesn't need to know your private keys to send you the bitcoin. They need to know only your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:24:21


1) how do you know that the bitcoin you received are "real"?  
2) are you aware that you are leaking substantial info about your bitcoin balances to third parties (i.e, your wallet's third party nodes)?  
3) are you aware that in case of a contentious hard fork your wallet's node provider will decide which fork to support (giving you no other choice than to follow along)?  
4) are you aware that in case of a coordinated miner attack you are dependant on your wallet's third party nodes to not misbehave?  
If any of those questions matters to you, you should use your own node. You are using a node anyway already (if you hold/transact bitcoin), so it's better to make sure it's your own node instead of a third party ;)

There is no cohesive, homogenous bitcoin community. There are groups of people with cohesive, homogenous political opinions (or dietary choices, or whatever) who also happen to be enthusiastic about bitcoin, but such groups are mostly a minority within the larger group of bitcoin users and there is always another group with opposing or conflicting opinions and choices. None of those groups defines the bitcoin community*, or bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is for everyone.

2140... Off by 100 years ;) 


This is not how it works. It's not a democracy where miners vote for something. Having a majority of hashpower allows for potential doublespends, but implementing a different supply cap would need a) new code for nodes, b) users voluntarily updating their nodes with that code, c) miners running that code, d) social consensus on different levels (exchanges, businesses, users/holders agreeing that this is the "new" bitcoin) AND that there is no contentious debate after the inevitable split from people who want to keep the current supply cap (and this will be the vast majority of holders - why would anyone of them see their stash dilluted)? Good luck getting that on the most contentious issue of them all in bitcoin. Not gonna happen.

If there are no people who value bitcoin enough to hold it over longer time periods, it's also useless as a payment method (because nobody would want to accept it in the first place).  
Also, hodling = using by transacting in time to your own self ;)  
In any case, both (hodling / using) are not two binary options... You cannot hodling without at least one transaction, and you cannot transact without at least some period of hodling.

I think as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable and storage techniques become more secure, the loss rate will decelerate. People will be incentivized to take much better care of their bitcoin and have much better tools to do so.  
I mean, ten years ago bitcoin was worth nothing and there weren't any hardware wallets etc around. Of course nobody really cared to secure their private keys. The landscape is much different now. Losing one bitcoin is already quite painful. Ten years ago losing ten thousands of bitcoin was just "meh, who cares".

Stop posting screens of your bitcoin wallets or other private data!  
Even if it includes no direct possibility to steal your money, you show the whole world: a) how much bitcoin you hold, b) you are most likely to live in HK or at least use HKD, c) what wallet software you use and so on. Someone motivated could now sniff out your bitcoin address and keep track on your transactions, or hack your reddit account, get hold of your email address and try to impersonate you to your friends, asking them for money (ok, this is not directly related to the screenshot here) and whatever else someone might come up with.  
Don't leak information without need! Reversing leaked information is much more difficult/impossible than just to not leak it in the first place for some internet points.

A full node verifies that the bitcoin you receive is "real". A wallet (software or hardware) is asking a full node to verify the transactions. If you don't run a full node yourself, you implicitly have to trust Ledger's full nodes (which your wallet connects to by default). You also leak privacy to their full nodes (because your wallet asks for particular transactions and addresses).  
Running a full node is as easy as downloading the software from  and let it sync.  
Connecting a hardware wallet to a full node is a bit trickier, as you'll need another piece of software (called Electrum Personal Server) as a workaround. But it's not that hard either :) And "soon" Bitcoin Core (that's the name of the full node software) will implement necessary steps for hardware wallets being connected to it directly. But "soon" in open source development is not very well defined ;)

Correct so far, except that the reward is not for "rebroadcasting" (your transaction is already "out there" and other nodes already propagate your transaction for free), but for a miner to incorporate your transaction into the next block. Mining is expensive (costs for energy + hardware + maintenance), and the fee you attach to your transaction incentivizes a miner to mine it. This is why the bitcoin network is secure (because it is profitable for miners to contribute to its security).  


Why should a miner go for the cheap fee first? They would lose money doing that (by leaving more profitable transactions on the table) :)

@_date: 2019-04-09 10:02:11
It's technically correct, but this will matter much sooner than 2140, as already ~80% of all bitcoin has been mined, and by ~2032 the block rewards will be less than 1 bitcoin (compared to today's 12.5 bitcoin per block). The long tail of the following years after 2032 is just negligible amounts of bitcoin issuance.

A node protects you from leaking your privacy and verifies your receiving transactions for you. But it doesn't protect you from your phone being stolen or hacked, or the software of the phone wallet malfunctioning etc.

@_date: 2019-12-12 23:01:24


Amen to that. A node does not contribute substantially to the network, it is supposed to contribute to its maintainer's privacy and sovereignty (independence from third parties when receiving/verifying/broadcasting transactions). There are some minor benefits to the network though, like increasing "privacy by numbers" for other nodes, but it is negligible in comparison to the primary purpose of a node.  
Nevertheless, using(!) your own node contributes to the robustness of the network indirectly, because as more people don't have to rely on third parties, the less the network is prone to certain types of attack.  
Also, it shouldn't be discouraged to run an unused node for whatever reason. Who knows when you might need it, and it is also a great learning experience :) So well done OP! :)

Anonymity and convenient is not cheap, convenient and cheap is not anonymous etc. You need to think if you value one or two of those more than the others and adjust your choices accordingly. For anonymity, you have to go either the ATM route (expensive) or find some in-person sellers (inconvenient), or use something like Bisq (has its own trade-offs), etc.  
All regulated exchanges (cheap and convenient) ask for your documents and other info, so you can kiss your anonymity good bye there.

Bitcoin won't replace fiat any time soon. But even if all CBs in the world somehow manage to "fix" (what does this even mean?) the currencies that they control, who can guarantee that they will behave well and make optimal decisions in maintaining their currency in the future? But besides that, what guarantees me that my wealth won't be confiscated by politicians or by other figures of authority? That question goes beyond the utopian scenario of CB's being perfect, because a central bank behaving badly is not the only scenario where bitcoin can shine (although an important one).

**not tax advice, seek out opinion of a professional**  
As I understand the laws commonly applied in such situations, the important point for you here is the moment of disposal, i.e. when you actually are mailing out the device.  
I guess the more interesting question is: if the price jumps (or falls) considerably while the device is on its way, which cost basis will the recipient have to assume (for later, when they decide to sell/dispose the bitcoin)?  
But in any case, I have no idea, just thinking out loud.

Your understanding is correct. You either have to balance out your channels (simply spending, or balancing manually by sending LN payment to an exchange/service and then withdraw on-chain), or to request an inbound channel opened to you (Eclair itself offers that afaik, also other services like LNBig, lightningpowerusers.com, bitrefill.com etc etc).

@_date: 2019-04-08 12:59:39
The primary purpose of a node is to verify your own transactions. Otherwise you implicitly trust the miners (and blockexplorers etc) to tell you the truth about the transaction you are interested in.  
A full node verifies every transaction on its own and gives you certainty that a transaction (or a block) is valid. The node also stops invalid transactions from propagating in the network (it doesn't really "stop" it, but it doesn't broadcast it further and potentially blocks the node broadcasting invalid txs/blocks).  


Just nitpicking a little bit, but since we're in the mentor thread... :)   
There is actually no THE pool. Every node maintains their own "pool" of (valid!) transactions that it has seen broadcasting from other nodes. No nodes = no "pools". That's another purpose of a node (validating and broadcasting tx's). 
@_date: 2019-12-22 08:55:02


What does this even mean? :)  
"HW" is commonly an abbreviation for "hardware wallet". A paper wallet is obviously not a hardware wallet.  
To answer OP's question: if you don't have any plans to transfer out or into your paper wallet, you probably don't need a hardware wallet. The implied assumption here is that your seed has been created safely, offline and by a "legit" method (not some random online wallet generator site or something like that).

@_date: 2019-04-10 12:39:41
Just a minor correction:  


It's only a rough estimate and might be wholly incorrect in particular scenarios. The bitcoin network does not deal with time. It deals with blocks. Difficulty adjustment occurs every 2016 blocks, and if the mining power drops down very harshly, it will take (potentially) much longer than 2 weeks to adjust, because it would take much longer for those 2016 blocks to be mined.  
Two weeks is just an estimate how long it would take to mine 2016 blocks with the currently available hashing power.

This is exactly the same issue with any wallet that is not connected to your own full node. Lightning or no lightning. Only way to verify if your bitcoin balance is "real" is to let your node verify it. And if you run one, you can also be sure that the bitcoin you receive on lightning is real.

It depends on your bitcoin usage and how you are taking care of your privacy. In general, since every transaction and everything on the ledger is public, the activity is trivially to see. Although transactions are pseudonymous, as soon as there is a link to your identity (because you identified yourself to Coinbase f.ex), there likely will be a connection to your other transactions.  
Example: in your wallet you already have 1 bitcoin hat you bought in person anonymously. Now you bought 0.5 bitcoin on Coinbase and transferred on your wallet. So you have two coins (1 and 0.5 bitcoin) sitting there. As long as you don't move them, no one can make a connection between those two (assuming you didn't reuse the address!). But if you make an outgoing transfer for 1.2 btc, those coins will be linked together and an outside observer (Coinbase or an analytic company that works with them, i.e Chainalysis) will be able to link both coins to your identity. Or at least know that both coins belong to the same entity (even if they don't know your ID).  
That's why it's important to understand and practice coincontrol, and use coinjoining mechanisms such as Wasabi or Joinmarket. You'll find the links to further reading here:

This answers OP's question, but the question itself is stated kinda incorrectly.  
It's not the "blockchain" that makes bitcoin (and Lightning) secure, it's cryptography, proof-of-work and the possibility to verify all the transactions for yourself in a permissionless, cheap and trustless way. "Blockchain" is just a way to structure a database. It's worthless without cryptography and PoW (as well as economical incentives and other things).

Your understanding is correct, everything that is sent to that address will be accessible with the 24 word seed. The 24 word seed is basically your private key in another format.  
The usual way of how the Nano is supposed to work is that the private key never leaves the device, except as an emergency back up in form of the 24 word seed. Now that you imported that seed onto another device, it has lost this advantage (in case your laptop/smartphone is hacked, someone could gain access to the seed). So I would recommend to create a new address on your Nano (in case you want to use it in the future) and transfer your funds on that new address.

You are right, too.

However, as with every software, the user is most likely the weakest point. If you don't practice coincontrol or have a weak understanding of how bitcoin UTXOs and privacy works, your privacy might be not as high as you hope (but in any case, it cannot be made worse by using Wasabi). You might want to read all their docs and FAQs carefully, and also look through other sources (f.ex here:

Just FYI: if the code is "bad"/compromised, f.ex if the randomness in the seed generator is rigged or just weak, it doesn't matter if your machine is offline or not, as the attacker might have an easy time simply guessing your seed (or already know it in advance).  
Not saying bitaddress does or does not do that, but I never would store any meaningful amounts on a key created by such a generator and you should make sure to let the recipients of your gift know that they shouldn't either.

The first version(s) of the Bitcoin software needed other peers in order to start mining, so Satoshi most likely wasn't mining alone. Although this is something that is difficult to prove (he could after all use multiple nodes), he ensured that everyone interested could mine right from the start by announcing the release two months in advance and introducing a single-click mining feature in the software. Also, ~~there was 8 hours time passing between the [genesis block]( *edit: 8 hours gap between the first [software release]( and the [first block]( mined (indicating that Satoshi didn't simply turned on his mining node just to race to mine as much as possible for himself).    
The evidence of how much he mined is also not robust, but somewhat reasonable to assume that he generated [around 700,000 btc](
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:56:56
Miners will be paid by transactions fees only (after the block rewards stop). Either this will provide sufficient security (meaning, there is a high enough price for bitcoin and/or sufficient demand for block space), or bitcoin will fail for the lack of economic incentives for miners to keep it secure.

It doesn't make sense to look at fiat volume when the local currency is (hyper)inflating. You'll get all time highs every week, even if the amount of bitcoin being traded is going down.  
edit: "All time high" in bitcoin volume is true for Kazakhstan though. But.. It went up from the previous all time high of 24 bitcoin to... 27 bitcoin traded per week. So it's not much by any standard (nevertheless, I'm happy about any increase in such countries, of course).

This already exists as the concept of "blockheight". It's not very precise (because there is mathematical variance between blocks, but it evens out to 10 minutes average time), but it's as universal as it gets. I don't think it would be possible to implement actual "human" time on-chain without having some kind of a trusted oracle source as input (the protocol has no way of knowing of "outside" events except of the hashpower).

No, the seed words are a back up of your existing wallet. If you import them onto another device, you'll have the exact same wallet (exact same history), just on another device.  
You should google what "coincontrol" and "coinjoin" is, and use something like [Wasabi]( It's not a magic wallet and you will need some effort to understand how transactions on the bitcoin network work, in order to use it effectively.

Be prepared to put in a bit of time and effort into learning. Practice with a small amount first, if this makes you feel more comfortable (f.ex try to delete and restore your wallet to see if you understand the process, before storing meaningful amounts of btc on that wallet).

Yeah, I think you just answered your own question with the second part, nice one :)  
In a catastrophic scenario, where a huge part of hashpower suddenly vanishes, the long adjustment time has its negative sides. However, it still will be possible to mine a block (will just take much longer than ~10 minutes) and sooner or later the difficulty will adjust itself (or more hashpower will come online again). Shorter adjustment times have more disadvantages (are more easily gameable/exploitable), but tbh, I am not entirely informed on those myself. So perhaps there'll be more qualified answers (and you most likely can find out more infos with google, those questions have surely been asked from the very beginning of bitcoin).

It doesn't benefit the network at large directly (besides some minor factors). But at the same time, the lesser users are dependent on third parties, the more robust the network overall.  
Basically, the primary reason to use your own node is to benefit yourself (higher privacy and less dependance on third parties). The benefits to the network are secondary.

Your question is a bit confusing, to be honest :)  
What you can print out is the private key, which is a long string of characters and which lets you control all the bitcoin associated with this private key. Perhaps this is what you are talking about?

Who is "we" and how are they connected to Hodlonaut? Is there some kind of proof or at least indication that this is legit? I've seen at least one lawyer mentioning on Twitter that they are working pro-bono (=for free) for Hodlonaut, why is there a need for donations at this point?  
Not making a point that is not legit, but I would like to see some answers to these questions before donating/promoting the site. The site itself doesn't say anything about this, which is a really bad idea if you solicit strangers on the internet for money.

The reason for that is that only the two participants of any given channel can see the transactions between themselves, no third party observer can see them. That's why gathering statistics on transaction amount is very difficult/impossible.

Never experienced a power loss while running a (lightning) node, but isn't that exactly the same as a restart? Depending on how long the power was out, it might need a while to catch up with the blockchain, but shouldn't be a problem. Don't think I had issues after a restart, at least. Also done some restarts where I simply had to pull the plug, because SSH was unresponsive and everything came back online by itself smoothly.

Fair enough :)   
But:  


Yes, in this case, your fiat is "deflationary" because it gains in purchasing power against the phone. So in this regard, my example is relevant, imo.  
But what do you think about the second point?
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:26:24
All of exchanges that touch fiat payments are working with chain analysis companies like Chainalysis, Ellipsis etc. They have to work with those due to regulations and anti-moneylaundering laws. Those companies have access to your personal data and their job is to link together your transactions on the blockchain, in order to ensure that exchanges that employ their (the chain analysis companies') services can show the regulators that they did their job with AML strategies.  
It has nothing to do with being paranoid. Those analytics companies make money from collecting your data and this data is entrenched on the blockchain forever. They might not use this against you directly, but they will do everything they can to maximize their profits, which means to squeeze everything information they can out of your transactional data.  
And I'm speaking only of the "good guys" here, not of the firms that are actually surveilling the transactions for other, more nefarious reasons.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:52:17
correct, it links to blockchain.info. Apparently you can buy Bitcoin through one of their partners (I think it depends from which country you are registered), and they are not shy to advertise in their wallet as well (web version).

May I ask what the point of this will be? You'd be able to restore your wallet from the private key, but it would be much more prone to errors (with a seed phrase you don't need to worry about getting a letter wrong, as long as the word itself is obvious... with a private key, if you get one digit wrong, you're screwed). Handling seed phrases is supposed to lessen the impact of human errors. And if you are going to store the private key written down somewhere anyway, you might as well just store it as a seed phrase.

Correct. Reusing addresses is strongly discouraged for that reason (privacy).  


Well, if you use KYC ("Know Your Customer") services, like any exchange that asks for your ID, they would know your receiving address.  
Furthermore, the way bitcoin works is this: let's say you received 1 btc from a KYC exchange (they know your receiving address and can link it to your identity). Then you receive (independent of the first transaction) another 1 btc from an anonymous source. The transactions are not linked so far.  
But if you at some point need to send someone 2 btc, your wallet will combine the two previous transactions into one, and the party which knows your identity (i.e, the exchange who sold you the btc, and the chain analysis firms that this exchange gives data to), can now deduct that the second transaction has been yours as well.  
There are ways and tools to mitigate this (coinjoin, wallets with coincontrol feature, wallets like Wasabi, and just maintaining good practice in the first place) though.  
Hope this makes it more clear :)
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:34:27

A decoy wallet would be handy in such a situation, I think (assuming the burglars don't have information on your exact stash amount), like with 10%-30% of your overall funds, just to let the attacker to get away with something and give them a reason to leave you alone.

“The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain. If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.".  
I'm guessing this means that if you want to use bitcoin officially (offer it as a payment method in your store etc), you have to give up the anonymity part of it? I am not sure how this will play out...
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:12:05
You are free to use bitcoin as you see fit, of course. That's the beauty of it :) 
But it's essential that syncing up and using a node is as easy as possible in order for bitcoin to stay trustless, decentralized, permissionless and censorship resistant though (because all those properties depend on bitcoin being easy to verify in terms of transaction validity, supply cap and so on).  
See f.ex this reply by Pieter Wuille why running a full node is important:

It's not a community because it's neither a cohesive, homogenous group nor do the members of this "group" share all the same views, goals and interests. Actually, the views/interests are at times quite in conflict with each other.  
There are definitely sub-groups with overlapping views/interests, but a "bitcoin community" at large doesn't exist in my view. Except if you define the bitcoin community as everyone that holds bitcoin, but if this is really the only qualifier to belong, it's pretty vague and doesn't encompass the various (opposing) views within this "community".

The seed phrase is just an expression of the private key, they're both the same thing basically. The common practice is to store the seed phrase, instead of the "raw" private key, and that's what I'd strongly recommend to you, too. Make sure though that you make a "test run" with your seed phrase before deleting anything though.

The rules of the game can change overnight, while your data is out there, on an immutable ledger, for anyone to see and analyze, forever.  
It's very difficult/impossible to "unleak" your privacy. Much better to implement good practices and not leak it in the first place. Why would you give it away, having to trust that the entities which have your data won't abuse it?  
And even if they don't abuse it, they profit from it. And you carry all the risks, while they reap the rewards. And companies can be hacked and data can be stolen etc.

So I understand it right that segwit blocks consume the same amount of resources regarding bandwidth, but less amount regarding disk space, cpu etc?


Could you please give some examples of what "bad things" might be caused by segwit? I.e, what would be some possible risks?  
And yeah, it makes sense that a doubling of capacity is already a huge change in a big, running system.. That was a helpful example. But at some point in the future (assuming further adoption of bitcoin) it will be necessary to increase the capacity again, which has to be then on the block size level (because segwit cannot provide further increase "by itself"), as I understand? This would mean that bigger blocks are likely to happen anyway? edit: ah, I guess segwit would enable further scalability solutions like LN etc, instead of bigger blocks?

Exodus has knowledge about your conversion of ETH to BTC, and Gemini has knowledge about the initial BTC transaction to Exodus.  
If Gemini and Exodus are subject to the same regulation, or share the same chain analysis company, it's trivially easy to link all your transactions together, and link your identity to them.  
I don't know enough about Exodus and what jurisdiction/regulation they are subject to though. Just pointing out that on-chain transactions are not anonymous by default. Pseudonymous at best. But not even that if you touch KYC services like Gemini (and don't know how to unlink your transactions from your identity further down the road).

@_date: 2019-04-17 08:41:28
There is no "best" solution. It all depends on your level of technical skills/understanding (a more secure set up requires better understanding in order to not screw anything up), and your threat model (what's the most likely kind of loss/attack that might happen in your circumstances?).  
If you want to go a company route, I suggest checking out Casa. They offer a very well thought-out multi-sig mechanism and the people involved are highly regarded in the bitcoin space (Jameson Lopp). I don't know about insurance though, I don't think they offer one for their storage (and it wouldn't make sense in their model anyway, as they don't store anything themselves... just one of the 3-of-5 keys, I believe).

They could in very specific circumstances: when their transaction has been constructed as RBF (replace-by-fee) transaction, AND hasn't been confirmed yet. Then they'd be able to replace this transaction with another one (going to a different address), if the original transaction still has 0 confirmations.  
This is why it's a good idea to either wait for at least one confirmation, or to ensure that the transaction is not RBF, if you know how to do it.

They are free to use (except hardware wallets, which are an actual, physical piece of hardware). But you always have to pay a mining fee when transacting, which you have to set for each transaction. Most wallets have something like "low - medium - fast" options, and if you're not in hurry, you usually can choose "low" in order not to overpay fees. Don't worry, you'll figure it out when you play with the wallet of your choice :)

A "blockchain" is not a technology, it's something you download. Literally, it's a chain of blocks with data. The data in the blockchain is not secure just by itself: it's secured by proof-of-work, cryptography and economic incentives. This system is costly and inefficient, but it has some very valuable properties, such as censorship-resistance, immutability, permissionlessness etc.  
But it gains it only in combination with the mentioned components: PoW, cryptography, economic incentives. People/organisations trying to sell you some miraculous "blockchain tech" for the most part are trying to make money with bogus claims.

There is no person B and there is no promise to pay me in the future.

I must have missed the news, so not sure what you mean here.. But do you really believe that someone in their position would **honestly** announce such kind of things in advance, getting much less $ for their btc because everyone is panicing? :) If I were in their shoes, I'd announce it before I actually buy, so I'd get in cheap :)

@_date: 2018-03-24 00:40:57
i appreciate your perspective, although I lack the necessary insight to speak about these things with any level of conviction.  
My understanding is that there are two scenarios. One: Bitmain has monopoly with covert ASICBoost. The other: Bitmain has less power, but that is enforced through defensive patent use by other players.  
It looks to me that both scenarios suck, but the latter one is much more preferable to me as a user.

I'm not familiar with any of them (used blockchain.info though in the early days). In this case, I wouldn't worry too much what's open and what's closed source (as long as it's a known wallet). If they are on your laptop or in a webbrowser, they are generally at risk, so I can't really recommend any of those names particularly.  
I guess your choice is either to spend some money for a hardware wallet or accept the risk. Depends on how much money is at risk, so up to you...
If you are really have only a hundred bucks or so, I'd at least move them from the laptop to a smartphone wallet, it might be slightly more secure if you plan to use cracked software and whatnot.. But really it's like moving from frying pan into the fire :)  
Generally, you should only have online as much, as you'd be comfortable carrying in your wallet with you in cash. Not your savings.

@_date: 2019-04-11 10:24:58
Hmm, this doesn't make it much clearer. The only way it makes sense to interpret this, is to assume it is about printing out the private key (a paper wallet, essentially). But since it talks about the "code", this is probably something different.  
Either I don't understand something here, or the author has some kind of misunderstanding of bitcoin. Not an unsurprising sight in academia circles, I'm afraid. Or perhaps something is just lost in translation. But I'm not able to make a lot of sense of what the author tries to say, sorry :/  
In any case, "a bitcoin" doesn't have a code "behind it". There is actually not even "a bitcoin" (or coins) on the network. There are only transactions in different sizes, which are comprised of inputs and outputs. You cannot locate a coin on the network, all you can do is to locate UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). Perhaps this is what the author doesn't understand? Just guessing here in the dark :)
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:24:03
it is in BTC. Coindance displays it wrongly, but if you look closely in the upper right it says "switch to VEZ", which means that the graph is in BTC

Thanks very much for the write up. Exciting stuff!

@_date: 2018-11-29 16:17:03


Well, in theory, yes...  
But the avg user leaks privacy on many ends... How many times have you pasted in a bitcoin address into a blockexplorer? And how many of those were your personal addresses? A reasonable guess would be: most of them. So the person/entity behind the blockexplorer can link those addresses to your IP/computer type/ISP/whatevs, if you haven't met some precautions.  
Or: do you run your own full node? Because if not, your wallet (be it Ledger, Trezor or whatever else) is asking a  third party node for transactions, which also can (theoretically) be linked to your persona, or IP address etc...  
Then there's all kinds of social engineering and whatnot. I'm not an expert even, so who knows what entities with a lot of know-how, time and resources are able to find out about people who are sloppy with their privacy. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:12:20
Totally agree, but you can't take the capabilities of the current LN-wallets, which are mostly not even in beta yet, as the final state of things to be. LND client for example, has now an autopilot feature which opens a channel (or multiple) automatically, when you load up your LN wallet. It's all gonna be much better than it is now :)

By "stupid" I meant something like sending coins to a wrong address or losing your back up key :)  
In that sense, you have something "at stake" indeed, but it's not the primary purpose of funding a channel (compared to models like Proof Of Stake, where you lock up coins not for transactions, but for other purposes)

You have to factor in bandwidth, CPU power, propagation speed of blocks through the network etc, especially if you are trying to sync a node from scratch. Storage space is a quite minor issue compared to those.

Things like this have been happening (kidnappings, ransom), and will happen in the future, as the prices rise. One of the most important things is not to boast about your bitcoin holdings. Also, keeping your seeds safe and secure. 
I'm really not sure what would be good against $5 wrench attacks though. Multisig?
Perhaps locking up coins for a while? But still, the attackers could get their hands on the private key for later use, or even if not, they could get angry that they're not able to get it and do physical damage...  
No guaranteed protection in any case... Best to just keep a low profile :)

It's only impossible if you don't accept the lending of non-existent assets and demand "the real thing", or at least a undeniable verification of funds.  
If I have one bitcoin, but create two certificates of one bitcoin each, and lend them both out, there's nothing the blockchain can do if the two fellas I've lent it to simply accept the deal.

The propagation (your outgoing transactions) is not so much of a problem with third parties. It's the incoming transactions that are more important, because you want to validate them on your own, without third parties (so no one can give you fake bitcoin).

1) If I close channel manually, will the LND autopilot also try to open a new one? Or does it only jumps into play when I create a new wallet or something?  
2) I've tried to send, but got a "payment_error": "unable to route payment to destination: UnknownNextPeer", so I guess I should try to open another channel (perhaps close the current one)  
edit: although if I type "lncli queryroutes [destination] [sat amount]" (with the destination/amount derived from your invoice), there seems to be a possible route over multiple hops

Well, I think you could fool a regular, non-sophisticated chainalysis by doing something like five "hops", at least you'll have some plausible deniability.  But yes, it's not "anonymized" by that or anything, only a little.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:37:40
I'm not sure I understand you right, or if you perhaps misunderstand something. You don't need to do anything to sync a wallet between two devices. You can even install two completely different wallets on two devices, but as long as you use the same private key/seed on both of these wallets, they are "synced" automatically.  
The "syncing" happens because both of these wallets use the same addresses on the blockchain. You just need to make sure that you use the same private keys on the two wallets. F.ex, you install two fresh wallets (wallet A and wallet B) on two different devices, create a new private key on wallet A and import that key on wallet B. Voila - it's "synced" :)  
But you should read up on what private keys are and why you need to keep them safe and secure.  
P.S.: basically every wallet nowadays will create a new receiving address after the previous address has received a payment, it's pretty much the default nowadays.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:41:13
You are correct in your findings about the bitcoin twitter handle. It's mostly for (not so) covert marketing of BCH.  
Bitcoin Core is a very vague term for the software implementation and people contributing to its code on the github page. Due to the anarchic, open source nature of the whole project, there can't be a unified voice (like a twitter handle) speaking for the whole group. It's kind of a side-effect of decentralisation :)

Fees won't stay that low forever, that's correct. We are much better prepared now though, with things like Segwit (basically bigger blocks), best practices like batching ("compressing" of transactions). Better fees estimation algorithms. Other improvements (MAST, Schnorr) are in development. 2nd layer solutions like Lightning.  
Don't get me wrong, far from "perfect", and we will hit new scaling ceilings, and then another round of FUD and complaints, and then another efforts to scale... Exactly like with internet itself.

Why should you get a discount for large amounts? Bitcoin is scarce and there's no shortage of buyers...  
 
And buying from a miner directly will actually (probably) cost even more, cause the coins don't have any history.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:02:31
To add to that, I'm sure there will be small, but powerful "tricks", like using the change output from a transaction to fund/fill up a channel when you make a non-LN transaction, thus not creating an extra transaction for opening a channel. Basically a smarter UTXO management, which results in a much more efficient on-chain usage.  
 
Also, channel factories (though I haven't heard anyone talking about it lately). 
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:11:40
Will it hurt you financially if you lose all or most of those $1300? Are you willing to put in a little bit of time and effort in understanding the basics of bitcoin (how to transfer it to your own wallet, how to back it up safely and why it is important)?  
If the answers are "no" and "yes", then you should consider it :)

Yes, I was just describing what I am seeing (in the Slack channels, dev groups, Reddit etc etc). There are currently very few people who are able to transact on mainnet Lightning and mostly they do so for testing reasons. Again, that's my personal perception, which is obviously very limited.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:01:00
Short answer: no, there aren't. Every trustworthy exchange asks you for your personal data. It sucks but it's a trade off for convenience/security.  
As suggested here, you could use a P2P exchange like bisq (what I don't like about it is that you have to flash your bank account to an unknown person, but perhaps they have also more anonymous transfer options, I don't know), or localbitcoins.com

First, learn a bit and do some reading, especially until you understand why it's important to have control over your own private keys (and not let third companies hold them for you).  
Bitcoin.org is a good place to start, but also this list of resources:   
When you decided to go ahead and accept bitcoin in your shop, you either can have customers pay you on your (mobile) wallet, or if you want a real Point-of-sale, read this (the first comment, which is a copy of the deleted post):

That's true, but in this case he got invited to talk with the purpose to give the government members a neutral picture about Bitcoin. And now if some of them go online to verify his points, they'll see that the topic is quite charged and inflaming, and if
 they become aware that he had some financial incentive to make these statements specifically, it will undermine all the other points the speaker made. Like, "what other agendas did he get paid for to push on us?"

I did the "sudo apt-get update" command and was about to do the "upgrade" one. It says that it needs "130mb of archives" and wants to upgrade a whole bunch of "packages".  
Can I just proceed with it? Feeling a bit skeptical if the 130mb data will go to the mounted HDD automatically? And also if that's fine to do while the bitcoin service is running on the Pi, or should I first stop it or do anything else?

1. All these explorers are not 100% reliable, they mostly depict the network from the point of view of one, single node, which not always sees everything.  
Imagine you are in a room full of people. From your perspective, there will be people hidden behind others, so you won't have the "bird's eye" view on the whole room.

Not a stupid question :)

I'm not an expert, so can't answer that one really. I assume that these will be only some edge cases (because vast majority of the nodes will see the vast majority of the network). My understanding is that if you (your node) doesn't see the receiving node on the network, you have to connect and open a channel with that node directly. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:58:53


There's two kinds of closing: one where both parties agree/sign (called "mutual closing"), and one where only one party agrees (called "unilateral closing").  
The main difference is that mutual closing is instant (since there's no dispute possible between parties, as they already agreed everything is cool), while unilateral closing takes a bit longer (as there's a tiny possibility that one party wants to dispute the final balance).  
This all happens automatically btw. Disputing, agreeing etc is all done by the software, not manually ;)

if they actually don't allow bitcoin withdrawals to your private wallet, then they don't sell you "real" bitcoin. Your best bet is then to withdraw the fiat money (to your bank, debit card etc) and buy bitcoin through other means.  
Alternatively, you could try and find a bitcoin exchange that accepts Skrill deposits and buy bitcoin on that exchange. I think BitPanda is one of those.

A plug and play device that serves as a Lightning node/wallet certainly will help broader adoption.

A little plug and play box is much better in that regard.

The "safety net" in this all is an educated community who is very interested/invested in self-preservation and its own wealth/sovereignty. There are no authorities who can provide you with guarantees, that's just not how anarchistic, self-regulating communities work. But I think exactly because of the nature of this system (where everyone involved has skin in the game), it's highly secure. People become very motivated to be critical and educated about the code, when their wealth and their freedom is depending on it :)

@_date: 2018-03-31 16:18:49
Ah, I see, thanks for explaining.  
I'm very far from being an expert in Bitcoin, much less so in "blockchain", but my current view is something like this:  
While blockchain is an excellent tool in areas where trust between two (or more) parties is absent, it (blockchain) has to be secured by a valuable token (such as bitcoin in the Bitcoin protocol), which in turn provides incentives for actors to secure the blockchain in form of some kind of work (electricity/hashing power in Bitcoin's case).  
This token cannot be issued/controlled by a third party (government f.ex), because otherwise you'd just again introduce trust in a supposedly trustless environment. And in order for this token to have value (while staying trustless), it has to have demand from buyers. And why should there be demand for something else than Bitcoin, if it's already proved itself trustless, immutable, censorship-resistant for almost ten years? Every other with a trustless token will need to compete against bitcoin in demand, and by now Bitcoin has also a longer track record, which a new blockchain cannot overtake in time.  
Also, if Bitcoin fails or encounters some difficulties along its way, this will be exactly (or similar to) what the "next big blockchain thing" will have to deal with, and it will have to solve exact the same problems (like we see now with Ethereum space, they have to deal with scalability, mining centralisation, community disputes etc) AND win the trust of the users back again, after the fail of the first and biggest blockchain.  
 
TL;DR: It just seems unwise to me to study blockchains while leaving out what the most important of them all actually does right now and which problems it has to deal with (and which ones it already has solved). From the outside, it looks like "blockchain" is on its way to become a new buzzword with a diluted meaning (like "dot-com" in the past). 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:28:32
I appreciate you taking the time to write down your explanation, thank you.  
However, I still don't understand where the "owe" part comes into this. When I have a balance on my side of a Lightning channel, I possess a fully valid, non-broadcasted bitcoin transaction, which no one can take away from me and which I can broadcast at any time I wish. Who or what owes me something in this case? The network?

It's most likely an attempt of a "dusting attack" (possibly breaking your pseudonymity):   
If you use a wallet that allows coin control (where you have a choice which UTXOs to send), you should mark this UTXO "unspendable" (Samourai Wallet does this automatically, I believe).

It's all in alpha phase though and no one really knows when and how such things come to live.

It's not up-to-date with modern tech standards (promising Segwit since 2017, I believe), so you can only guess how good their security is.  
Also, "can be accessed from any computer" indicates that you are looking for a web wallet? Those are inherently unsafe in the first place. But I guess ok if you want to store very small amounts of bitcoin in them for convenience reason. Don't know about good web wallets unfortunately, as I don't use them myself.

You must have missed the discussion surrounding the creation and use of decentralised exchanges :) Bisq is one of those.  
Also, centralised infrastructure around a decentralised protocol doesn't change the decentralised nature of the said protocol. If one (or even all) of those exchanges fail (as many already did), bitcoin still will be fine.  
A certain degree of centralisation in the infrastructure is btw necessary as a trade off for convenience. But again, it doesn't necessary change the underlying bitcoin protocol.

The article by New York Times describes how Georgia bets on bitcoin as "a ticket to get onto the world map", and the role Bitfury plays in it.  
It's pretty huge imo: it's the first state actor which explicitly encourages bitcoin and mining industry to set up business in their country. They're doing it right (although I'm sure there were some funds exchanged "under the radar" to get that one approved).

That's false. Plenty of people made satoshis from routing. But it's correct that it's not profitable at the moment to run a LN node purely for routing fees.

Thanks!

So I successfully installed LND (and updated the config files etc). I created a new LND wallet and am able to unlock it and use the commands "lncli walletbalance" and so on.  
But when I try to create new address with "lncli newaddress np2wkh", it hangs up (= nothing happens after I press enter and I can only use "ctrl + C" to go back to the command line). I gave it quite a lot of time (few minutes), but no success still. Any ideas?
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:16:37
You will need either a special wallet (such as Zap, Eclair, LND) or your wallet developers will need to implement lightning.  
The wallets mentioned above are not ready yet for "mass production", but you can use them if you are not shying away from configuring and using everything with command lines. Check out the github pages (searching for the mentioned wallet names)
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:26:56
Ah, I see what you mean now, yes. You are saying that because the off-chain transaction is not yet broadcasted, the blockchain is not up-to-date? But you can broadcast at any time you wish, so what is the issue?  
As I mentioned, for critical sums I also would stay on-chain, at least for now.. But if you want to save on fees or want to use micropayments (not possible onchain), you can make the trade off of broadcasting later. It's not like you can "trick" the blockchain in any way, it just gets updated at a later point?

Pull request for rebranding to "Bitcoin Core" (from 13 Dec 2013):  It was controversial at that time (and probably not the best idea, but here we are). Originally it was proposed by ~~Gavin Andresen~~ Mike Hearn (see Aaron v. Wirdum's reply below).     
A bit of history is also described here: [Who Controls Bitcoin Core?](  
 
edit: but yeah, you got it right:  


@_date: 2019-01-29 14:53:45


I see. Well, that's quite a noble reason :)  
Speaking for myself, I don't think bitcoin's price will increase "astronomically". But I am somewhat confident that the price in, say, ten years, will be higher than it is today. And I am also fully accepting and prepared for the price to be lower during those ten years or even forever. Nothing is impossible.     
But it is not only the price: it's also voicing of disagreement with (parts of) the banking system in general and with (parts of) the financial practices of my country, as well as monetary system as a whole. Obviously I am aware that my voice doesn't count much, but I am doing something that I find right and good, and that's all I can do as an individual: withdrawing my participation (at least as far as I can) from a system I find flawed, and transferring my time and money into a system that I find better. 
 
To your second group:  


I am actually hugely optimistic for the world in general. I think bitcoin will empower people in general, and it doesn't have to overthrow the banking system completely (I don't believe it will, at least probably not in my lifetime). It is enough if bitcoin offers a viable alternative as an exit from the politicized financial system, abuse of authority, and abuse of money printing press. Better to have an exit option (even if not perfect) from that system, than no option at all.  
Imo bitcoin will do well even without a catastrophical system failure and I am definitely not wringing my hands in joyful expectation of any kind of economical crashes.  
Furthermore, it's also interesting from a research/technical point of view, and having "skin in the game" motivates me to learn more about it and improving my understanding, as well as OpSec (operational security) skills, such as taking care of my keys, my back ups etc.  
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:49:31


I guess the problem is that our definitions differ here. "Bitcoin maximalist" for me is someone having a high degree of conviction that in the long run one cryptocurrency will accrue the most amount of value/users, and it looks like it will be bitcoin.  
This conviction can be arrived at by logic and reasoning, and doesn't need to be expressed as "loud, demanding, invasive" (as you describe). I've seen plenty of people arguing in an opposite way of that. Not saying that being "maximalist" protects somehow from being a troll, but screaming and shouting is not what makes one a maximalist - in my opinion.

I doubt that people involved in bitcoin would ever claim to foresee every possible outcome. It has a very good reason why the whole thing is in constant development, getting fixed and patched and updated as we go.  
The way I see it, a group of people had a neat idea how one of multiple (!) scaling solutions could look like and started writing code for it. Users seem to like that idea (myself included). Of course everything has trade-offs somewhere, especially in cryptography and economics, and no system is perfect on its inception, so we'll have to see how things develop.

What does "on the QT" mean?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:39:13
This is all mostly true. However, "the more nodes the better" is not that simple. If I spin up 1000 nodes on AWS today, it won't matter at all, since they are all on one server and not really under my control. Also, they are not doing anything since there is no activity (actual transactions) going through them.  
A node which you fully control (your own hardware) and which you actually use for incoming/outgoing transactions is more important (mostly for the user than to the network itself) than 1000 idle nodes on an Amazon server.  
An idle node (without in-/outgoing transactions) on your own hardware is actually also not that important, except perhaps for bootstrapping new nodes (and perhaps being of value to the owner to learn about how the network works etc).

No, I realized it.. OP makes an argument **against** the argument, that on-chain scaling is somehow superior to off-chain scaling, because off-chain scaling might be considered money transmission, while on-chain can not (this is usually a flawed argument by Lightning opponents and on-chain scaling proponents, which OP seeks to refute). Which is a little bit tricky to understand in itself, and especially since people tend to read only the title without bothering reading further.

It doesn't give power to hubs. Since everyone can run a node and connect to everyone, hubs (= nodes with more connections than other nodes) won't be able to exploit their position, because if they misbehave (trying to take high fees, going offline etc), the payments will simply be routed around them. Hence, they have no power (as no node does on the network).  
Also, it doesn't steal miner's business, because it aims at instant small- and micro-payments, which are uneconomic (or not possible at all) on-chain. Users still will want to move bigger amounts over on-chain. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 13:34:25
You might wanna use Samourai or Electrum for Android. Keep in mind though, that phone wallets are inherently less safe than hardware wallets. It depends on your usecase though (it isn't worth getting a hardware wallet if you only have something like $20 bucks worth of bitcoin).

@_date: 2019-01-21 17:36:59


No.  


what is meant by wealth equalisation? I guess emerging economies could make an asymmetric bet (bet with small downside and big upside), and if bitcoin is still around in the next year/decades, those countries might have increased their wealth tremendously (also not from the price itself, but from nurturing related start ups/talent etc).   


backwards states/people are very quick to ban things and technologies they don't understand and don't feel in control of  


Difficult to say. Can go both ways (you could argue, it might get more corrupt, as it gets easier to hide your wealth). Depends on the implementation, I guess.

I don't have enough cryptographic knowledge/skill to see a solution to the following problem: if your users are anonymous, there is no way to ensure that the payouts from the game are fair. The only way is to give up anonymity and introduce KYC (know your customer), but since I am sure no one in their right mind would agree to such a KYC lottery, I would just give up :)

It's not *that* hard either tbh. For an avg person it's absolutely fine to just use a hardware wallet and store your seed phrase wherever you store your valuable documents.

I suppose it depends on what exactly the pools are colluding on, in your scenario?  
Very broadly speaking, the economic incentives to behave according to the protocol rules are higher than to try and "cheat" (again, depending on what we actually mean by cheating).  
If by collusion you mean that a majority of miners try to alter the rules of a protocol, they just fork themselves off the network (and create an altcoin), if the nodes (with economic activity), businesses, exchanges (and users in general) don't accept their rule changes as valid.

Yup, I already admitted somewhere else in this thread that my analogy sucks in that regard :)  
LN is different in this case though, because as soon as I (person B) get the transaction, my channel partner (person A) cannot doublespend this transaction anymore. And if they try to cheat (broadcast an old state of the channel, where they have a higher balance than the new state), I get their channel balance as a penalty for their misbehaviour.

Ok, after another restart and waiting for a while LND opened a channel automatically! Yay :)  
Two questions:  
Are multipath payments already possible? I wanted to order some things from the Blockstream store, but don't have enough funds in the current channel, and neither in the remaining balance in the "on-chain" wallet. Both together would be sufficient though. Can I just open another channel (direct to Blockstream) and then fulfill the invoice sending funds over both channels?  
I'm assuming that's not possible yet, but just making sure it's correct.  
(I guess my other option would be just to "top up" the existing channel with more funds and hope that it can find a route to Blockstream? Would topping up be possible at all? Couldn't find anything on the LND API reference page)  
2: do you know any cool possibility where to make a small transaction to see if everything works? Want to give me an invoice for a small tip perhaps, like $2 or so? :)

Exchanges (custodial wallets) can also be considered 2nd layer. Other methods of transacting bitcoin off-chain, like Opendimes, are sometimes also called 2nd layer.  
The article in the OP describes a (custodial) transaction, which is settled on the 2nd layer (LN), which in turn is based on the 1st layer (bitcoin on-chain), so I think it's fair to say it's 3rd layer. But this is rather semantics, I guess. 
In any case, it wasn't possible to earn (and withdraw/deposit) single Satoshis in the past, and this is changing now and creating such new usecases (micromining) like described in the OP.  
P.S.: my username is mentioned in the article. I guess I'm famous now! :D

I'm not familiar with localbitcoin's wallet, but I assume it's a custodial one (which hold bitcoin on your behalf, but doesn't give you access to private keys, which is crucial). So I'd recommend to withdraw your bitcoin to your own wallet to have the maximum amount of self-sovereignty and independence.  
Generally recommended wallets are:

Why fighting? You can earn it, buy it, trade it...  
The individuals who were early in the game will get wealthy, yes, but they had also to carry a much bigger risk holding the bitcoin in the early stages, so they are rewarded more if it gets successful.  
My point is, the concentration of bitcoin is dissolving over time. In 2009 it was only a handful of people having bitcoin on their hands, and over the years it became more and more.

It's way too early for marketing. [No one understands bitcoin yet]( even people who spend years in the space. How do you market something that is so new, disruptive and constantly evolving?  
It's actually dangerous and counterproductive, I would argue. In the past, people tried to market bitcoin as "anonymous, no costs transactions", f.ex. And a few years later the realization started to settle in that no, it's absolutely not anonymous, and we need fees in order to subsidize for disappearing of block rewards.  
What we should strive for though is to make education and explanatory content, on-ramps etc as available and accessible as we can. People can then make up their mind what bitcoin is and what they can use it for.

No, as I understand it, each sell is calculated individually, not with averages. Only the buys are averaged. So if I buy 1 bitcoin for $50, then another bitcoin for $100 and then a third one for $120, my avg cost basis is  $90 per bitcoin. So when I sell one bitcoin for $150, I would make a taxable gain of $60 ($150-$90).

Re: Lightning: yes, indeed it improves the privacy, as all the transactions that happen within a channel are only visible to the two channel participants. Furthermore, if the payment is routed (not sent directly from A to B, but from A to E over B, C and D), the "hops" don't know the origin and the destination of a particular payment, only the previous hop and the next hop (onion routing).

Yes, to open a channel a node is needed. This node can be run by you personally (better, because you are in control, but requires some efforts at the moment), or by your wallet provider (easier, but you delegate trust to a third party). 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:59:51


Literally the highest reply says "it's always a possibility".  
It's unlikely though because there are quite a few skeptical eyes on every code change, and even if there were a malicious change in the code, it's up to node operators to install this code. So it's not like it can easily be "injected" into the network by malicious players. But no one can guarantee anything.

That's true, but it doesn't automatically means the opposite either. Besides, before bitcoin there have been already bitgold, hashcash and whatnot. You could easily make a comparison to those as myspace, yahoo etc, and bitcoin as facebook (uhmm... probably not a good example anymore)
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:12:53
I'm not sure, I think so yes. My understanding is that it looks for all possible paths before the tx is actually going out, so when a node is "blocking" the path, the transaction won't take that path in the first place. But yes, in this case it will automatically choose another path (one that is available)

"Prime time" is a little over-optimistic :)  
As far as I can see, it's being used for very small test payments mostly. Shouldn't be anything that has a major effect on the on-chain tx's. If any, it creates on-chain tx's, because people opening/closing LN channels for testing reasons.

A word of caution: the Lightning Network visualizers are not a 100% reliable source for stats, as they are mapping from a view of one particular node. F.ex, [this one]( shows 1347 nodes at the time of writing, and [this one]( has 1362. Same goes for the amount of channels.  
It's not a huge difference or anything, but something to keep in mind.  
edit: also I believe they don't show nodes that are not broadcasting themselves/their channels, as it is possible to have "private" channels

@_date: 2018-11-09 23:09:46
It kinda depends against which kind of "attacker" you are trying to protect your privacy. Generally, doing more hops between your KYC/non-KYC wallets is a good idea, but a sophisticated tool could still make a connection, based on some heuristics regarding time of broadcasting or some other patterns.  
You leak information by using the node of your wallet's provider, or pasting in addresses into blockexplorers (which can see your IP and also can assume that every address you type in is yours). So theoretically, someone or some software behind a blockexplorer can link all your addresses to you, based on the assumption that you are checking your own transactions.  
This is of course all very theoretical and probably no one will ever care about your transactions. Just trying to explain how much data you could potentially leak if you are really want to be private.  
Maybe read up what coinjoin is and on the Wasabi wallet. Thats probably the best way to assert privacy against non state-level actors.

Not exactly a replay attack, but there's an attack vector of broadcasting an older channel state (with a balance that benefits the attacker), but the preventive measure is that if the attacker gets caught, he loses his entire channel balance. Also note that this is only relevant when you receive payments (because if you're on "send only" mode, every older channel state is beneficial to you only, it cannot be beneficial for the attacker)

* immutable  
* censorship-resistant  
* open for all (permissionless) to participate in and build applications on top  
* inflation free  
* an exit from/alternative to the existing monetary system, although the reason "why" might not be obvious if you are living in a first world country with unrestricted access to the financial system
Also interesting from scientific point:  
* it solves some of the fundamental problems in computer science ("double spend problem" -&gt; digital information is easily copied, so if you send a photo to someone, you still have the exact same photo on your computer)  
* decentralised database (blockchain), where no single participant is able to tamper with it (see the points above) .

I cannot speak of "we", only from my own views. The problem is not the "big traders" in the markets, but having a few people/entities being in charge of the monetary system, as well as printing/issuance of money in the first place. This makes the monetary system (including payment railways etc) subject to censorship, exclusion, rent-seeking, corruption, "bail outs" on costs of regular people, power plays etc etc.  
People who have a lot of funds and splash them around on the markets are an insignificant annoyance compared to those problems above.

Stay away from custodial wallets where third parties are in control of your funds (Coinbase is a custodial wallet, f.ex). "Custodial" means, a third party holds your funds (= the private keys) on your behalf and has ultimate control over them.

I don't think they count it by the utxos, but by mapping the network from a view of a few well-connected nodes. It's not perfect either though, and doesn't take into consideration private channels... f.ex Eclair mobile wallet opens only private channels by default, afaik.

Thanks for the correction :)  
I see your point regarding Visa transactions. I think it's fair to say that third party payment systems such as Visa are a better medium of exchange at the moment, IF there is no need for censorship resistance, pseudonymity, and IF you have access to the banking system (which most of us here are privileged enough to have, but we are not the average world's human, we have to remember). If these attributes are desirable/necessary though (or you belong to one of the unbanked groups of humanity), bitcoin still outcompetes all else that is known to us yet.  
Also I would argue bitcoin will make vast improvements on the "medium of exchange" playing field as well. I'm curious what your opinion on the Lightning system would be in this regard?

In my opinion the following attributes make bitcoin valuable to me:  
* censorship resistance - no one can stop or undo my transaction    
* not confiscatable - one can make a point of $5 wrench attacks or other physical extortions, but no one can take it from me without me actually making a transaction. Which is different to all what we've known so far: gold, investments, bank accounts, houses etc etc, can all be taken away by someone through power without asking you. 
* highly transferrable - I can cross borders with my whole net worth in bitcoin just by memorizing the seed phrase. Try that with your net worth in gold or cash :)   
* consensus-based - the rules of the system are very clearly defined and cannot be altered by "someone in charge" (like with fiat).   
There are more things like immutability, permissionlesness, fungability etc, but they are linked to the points above. And the main point is of course: the actual value is determined by the participants of the system, but for me the said attributes have a very high value and I am willing to pay for them.

According to [Luke DashJr's script]( there are currently ~64.000 full nodes (including non-listening nodes, which most statistic sites don't include). Nobody knows how many bitcoin users there are though, so it's difficult calculate the % amount of how many users run their own full node.  
Also, how do you define a "bitcoin user"? Is someone who holds some btc on coinbase a user? Or someone who bought a tiny bit of btc five years ago? Etc

Just very briefly... I hope I can process/address more later. Again, thankful for your detailed feedback.






I don't think the bold part follows necessarily: first, I would not recommend anyone buying bitcoin without being mentally/financially prepared to actually lose those funds for real.  
Secondly, it should be self-explanatory that my opinions are not some objective truth, but my own personal convictions which seem reasonable and rational to me, but not necessarily to other people, and nobody is without biases and fallacies. I should not be held accountable for not adding disclaimers to every post of mine, like "this is only my personal, biased truth - not financial advise", imo.    


This would be a ridiculous statement to make: of course I don't believe bitcoin will outperform every other asset **at all times**. We see frequently that some altcoins pump harder than bitcoin in bull markets. But for the long term, I definitely would pick bitcoin over every other (currently known) cryptoasset.

Not really harm directly, but f.ex the two receiving addresses you posted are now linked together, as you combined the dust inputs into one transaction (or so I assume), so the attacker knows that the two addresses belong to one entity.

They might be able to see your IP.   


No, it's a trustless (trust-minimized) network  


Yes, the network is in an experimental phase still. Besides, if you don't know what you're doing, you're always at the risk of losing funds, so proceed accordingly.   


No, worst case is that you'll have to wait for a bit for your funds, if you want to close the channel and the other side is unresponsive  


You are only at the risk of being cheated if you receive payments. In this case, the other party can broadcast an older channel state (from the past where they haven't yet sent funds) and cheat you. But if you catch them doing so, you "win" all their channel balance (it's a punishment mechanism). For this your node needs to be online every now and then (and this is also the reason why you have to wait, if you want to close the channel and other side doesn't response - it's so they have a chance to check if you are broadcasting an older channel state or not)
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:20:33
No, you have the "withdrawal" option on every exchange, to get the actual bitcoin to your own wallet of your choice. You also don't get to keep forks of bitcoin if you leave it on Robinhood/Revolut and others. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:29:31
A very quick answer is that there is no universal price for mining. It heavily depends on the region (electricity costs are very different between geographical locations/jurisdictions) and other operational costs. Also there's something called "difficulty adjustment". If miners drop out, the mechanism adjusts downward and it becomes "easier" to mine again. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:11:56
it's possible theoretically, but it's not as easy as just throwing some huge amounts of money. You have logistical challenges of getting the equipment (it's not easy in such amounts and no hardware manufacturer will want to contribute to a plan that renders their entire business obsolete), getting the electricity, getting the space, transferring the equipment to the space, labor/maintaining cost etc etc etc.  
Then you will want to stay anonymous, which is not possible on this level of logistics you need to work with.  
If you reveal your ID, and you're a state actor, it will become clear to everyone that you don't want bitcoin to succeed and this will only motivate people to make it succeed, by letting the chain survive with a PoW algorithm change. Sure, this will be a huge blow for bitcoin short-term, but long term you won't be able to kill it and you'll reveal your hand and will spend an incredible amount of resources, for no pay off at all. And you would have made a huge amount of money, if you'd just mined bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:11:22


The fact that you don't just open the channel with the balance, you have to send the money through that channel, too ;)
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:38:19


But this doesn't make sense in my eyes. You don't tell the network "he owes me" in any form. You have a valid, on-chain transaction in your possession exactly the same moment, as soon as you have any balance on your side of the channel, and it's completely up to you when to broadcast this transaction. No one owes you anything and no one need to enforce some debt?

The diffifulty adjustment mechanism has no way of knowing what the prices are. It only "knows" how fast the blocks are produced. If the blocks are produced too fast (more than 1 block every ten minutes on average), it adjusts upwards (becomes more difficult). If the blocks are too slow, it adjusts downwards (making mining easier).  
The prices is not reflected in any of that. Although you could make a connection that the higher the price = the more people mine, but this is not necessarily the case. More people could mine because mining hardware becoming cheaper/easier accessible, or electricity prices are cheap for some reason, f.ex

Since there's no unique node names/identifiers, it's not really comparable. You might get some extra points in case there are later some algorithms that evaluate your usefulness as a routing node (for opening channels with you) based on metrics like uptime, "age" of the node etc, but it's unlikely to be of importance in majority of usecases (and I'm just speculating here anyway).  
Also it might give you an edge in technicals knowledge/skills, if you're an early adopter. But nothing directly quantifiable (like reserving some kind of a name, as in your example with domain names).  
edit: actually, there's a good way to find that out, OP. Set up a LN node today, report back in 2-3 years :)

Well it's normal that your wallet is empty then, no? :)

Well, even if the number of transactions stays the same, but the $ value of bitcoin doubles in the future, the $ value of the fees will obviously double as well...  
Also, I think it's pretty likely that the sat/byte fees will increate with increasing adoption as well. In something like 12 years the vast majority of bitcoin will be already mined and the miners will depend on transaction fees in order to be able to secure the protocol, so a fee market might not be a bad thing (although there exists a contrary opinion to that...)

What would be the point of a fork, if the evil entity would be able to mix/disguise their transactions? Since such a hardfork would be highly contentious and needed to be prepared in advance in public, the evil entity can easily avoid their coins being "forked away" by simply transfer them beforehand to other addresses through various coinjoin mechanisms or other privacy-enabling features.  
Another option for the evil entity would be to "donate" part of their funds to random's people addresses, such that in case of a hardfork many "innocent" addresses would be tainted, too (because you'd need to include those innocent addresses in the "blacklist", as you don't know if they still belong to the evil entity or not). Imagine the outcry when innocent people suddenly get hardforked away :D  
Interesting question though.

I'm not an economist, but since Bitcoin is deflationary, it is an alternative to an inflationary monetary system, so why shouldn't that be mentioned? If it's a better alternative or worse, it can be debatable... But that it *is* an alternative, is a fact, no?

For now, you need a full node to run lightning on it. Also, quite a few people would want t run a node for other reasons, but are too afraid of technicalities to set it up on a dedicated device, that can run 24/7.  
Such devices could contribute to further decentralisation of the network. You still have to put some trust into the manufacturer though, so it's a trade off between convenience and trustlesness here, of course

You cannot divide energy usage by transactions to estimate the cost-per-transaction, because the amount of transactions doesn't influence the energy usage (and vice versa). Also, it's a common misconception that proof-of-work is wasteful or inefficient.

I think in this case, "financial security of the network" is basically what arises when individual user run a node for their own good (to make sure they are not relying on third parties, miners etc). I would still maintain my point that running a node first and foremost serves the interests of the user running it, and contributes to the security of the whole network as a consequence (not the other way around - but I don't know, it's just a point of view.. I don't think we are disagreeing in any fundamental way).

All right, another question then... Are you sure you won't need the $1300 within the next 6-12 months (or better, 12-24 months)? Because if you will need them, you should be aware that bitcoin might fluctuate in value a lot within this time period, so if you're unlucky, you'll have to sell them for a lower price. It's not a short-term investing opportunity or anything :)  And no one can predict how the price will be in the next few months.

I assume they don't want bitcoin moving in/out of their app because of regulation concerns. They have an obligation to KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti Money Laundering), and would be getting hell from regulating government agencies if they'd allowed their customers to move pseudonymous funds over their app.  
The point people making against Revolut in this regard is that bitcoin's point is to be trustless (meaning, you don't need to trust a third party to hold your bitcoin), but with Revolut, you have to put trust that  
* they actually have the bitcoin that they're trying to sell  (it's so easy to fake that... fractional reserve banking etc)  
* in case of bankruptcy/hacks you'll get your funds back (your fiat funds are insured, but not cryptocurrency afaik)  
* they won't block or confiscate your account funds in some points in the future (try to research what PayPal does to its customers, blocking accounts/funds)  
Also, if you ever want to withdraw bitcoin from Revolut to your own wallet, or use them by sending it to a merchant, your friend etc, you are in bad luck because Revolut won't allow you to.  
And yes, learning stuff about private keys and how to store them securely does seem a little complicated at the first glance, but there are a lot of resources and solutions how to do that and freedom doesn't always come easy. But give it a try :)  You can always ask here for help and there are many resources available online for further research.

So to close a channel I type "lncli closechannel [chan_id]" - but this returns an error message (rpc error: code = Unknown desc = channel with chan_id=5395870150526552560000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 not found). Trying to do the same but with remote_pubkey or channel_point (instead of chan_id) also returns errors.  
To open a channel manually, I am trying to type "lncli openchannel [publickey]", whereby I try just public key, or public key with  at the end (plus the satoshi amount).. But so far no luck, and I am not getting smarter from the API reference site yet.  
Would be great if you could include an example or two in the guide how to properly construct a command for those actions, please :)

Note that constrained/unconstrained is not a value judgement here. It's just a framework to understand the current space better. I find myself on the constrained side of the argument. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:03:55
Lot's of people (me included) are using [Samourai]( which is awesome, but it is still in beta and it has quite a lot of (privacy) features, which are really cool, but perhaps not the most beginner friendly. Although maybe it's good that beginners have these tools for their disposal from the start?  
Otherwise I see often [Electrum]( and [GreenAddress]( mentioned around here, but I can't say how beginner friendly they are. Seem solid in any case.

The other replies answered your question already, but I wanted to add that I would strongly recommend ditching the blockchain,com wallet, as it is not up-to-date with modern tech standards and is not a secure wallet for any meaningful amount.   
Generally recommended wallets are:

@_date: 2019-01-21 18:46:10
It needs to sync (= download and verify) to the blockchain, which can take quite a bit of time depending on your internet connection and hardware specs. This is probably the reason why you don't see any transactions yet (if you already have any on your wallet)

**edit: either the connection to Sleepyark or just the time passing have solved the problem below :)**
Progress!  
Blocks "catching up" took me about 1,5 hours. Probably more overall, because I think the first 110000 blocks it caught up with before I've stopped the time. Counting that possibility in, it should be around 2h.  
Next hurdle: getting a large amount of those messages:    
Is it something I should just wait out or anything I can do?
edit: otherwise I guess I am almost done... Have sent some btc to my LND wallet, and connected to Sleepyark.. Only thing left is to open up a channel and get some stickers! :)

But I dropped a bunch of files from my laptop's SSD onto the external HDD, copied the "bitcoin core" file to my SSD and let it run over night. Then transferred "bitcoin core" back to HDD and the files back to the SSD and that saved a lot of time for me.

I don't use it* because they don't give you control over your private keys, which means you don't possess any actual bitcoin with Revolut. Also, it's not possible to withdraw (nor deposit) bitcoin with them.  
Please do some research what private keys are and why you don't have any bitcoin if you don't have access to he private keys. 
  
  
* Not using the crypto function. I love Revolut for fiat functions though

This sounds like a huge red flag.  
I don't have a lot of advice to give, except to never use this service again and for god's sake move your funds to a wallet of which you control your private keys (= non-custodial solution). Don't store your coins at exchanges/services where you are at the mercy of their will.

Not going to look for links, but some of the more articulate (but still making partially or entirely wrong statements about bitcoin, so proceed with caution) opposition writers have been David Gerard and Francis Coppola. They don't display a deep (or any) understanding of bitcoin, so I don't consider them "good" critics, but if you want to understand some of the more articulate "naysayers", I guess you want to look them up.  
Other than that, I don't know of many technically skilled outside of bitcoin/crypto, who offer valid criticism. Best critics are actually people from within the bitcoin community (Matt Corallo said that for different reasons he gives bitcoin a 90% chance to fail, a year ago on a podcast). I guess you also want to check out some of u/killerstorm (Alex Mizrahi) posts (quite technical).

While a figurehead might make things easier, I doubt it would be beneficial for the system as a whole. It just makes another point of failure (what if that person has biases, or just becomes corrupt in the process, or has a wrong understanding in an important question down the road?). Also, no single person or entity can combine *all* of the views (that are oftentimes contradictory) that are present within this ecosystem.  


 
Did you really understand in-depth what he was talking about or did it just feel good and sounded smart? :) Vitalik was trying to sell quantum computing miners for bitcoin a few years ago, ffs (not a joke, he was trying to raise funds for that).
Anyway, I strongly reject the idea of having someone speak on my behalf in bitcoin. I mean, I like Andreas and he's doing a great job, but I disagree with him in some things, too.  
I think it's better that everyone can speak for themselves in bitcoin. It sucks having assholes portray themselves as someone important, but I'll take that trade-off, as such people won't be able to stick in the long-term.

I paid around $70 for a Raspberry Pi package (incl. SD card + adapter, protection case, power adapter etc), and something like $50 for the HDD. You don't need any additional cables, keyboards or mouse, because you are connecting and setting up everything from your laptop/pc.

Completely disagree. If you see bitcoin as a risky asset, those will be the first ones liquidated in a "financial apocalypse" type of scenario. No one wants risky assets in such times.  
Also there are different types of crisis, some might be beneficial, some might be less beneficial for bitcoin's price (bitcoin itself will do fine regardless).  
I also disagree that a crisis is in any way needed for bitcoin to flourish. Bitcoin can be somewhat of a hedge, but I see it having an important place in the world even if things go right in all directions.

Well, in Bitcoin there is testnet ("fake" bitcoin, not real money, used for testing purposes by devs and users) and mainnet. The news was that the developer team of one of the lightning implementations (there are three) has officially announced that their software is in a state which is ready for mainnet. Meaning, it is stable enough and free of critical bugs, so that users can run it on mainnet. Before that, it was recommended to just run it on testnet because not all the bugs were ironed out.

That's a lot of questions, so answering only briefly.   


That's not correct. Mining costs are (mostly) depending on a) local electricity prices and b) current difficulty level.   
A) is very different from country to country and B) is dynamic. Meaning, if the difficulty gets high and miners drop out, difficulty will adjust downwards.  


Transaction speeds are instant. It's confirmations that take time - and that's for good reasons. Transaction costs have also their reasons (protection from spam and also subsidizing for lack of block rewards -&gt; incentivizing miners to mine even without block rewards -&gt; securing the network).  
Basically, everything you do in a distributed system is a trade off somehow. Want to make it faster? Need to trade off either in security or costs. Want to make it cheaper? Trade off speed or security. Want to make it more secure? It's going to be slower and more expensive. And so on.  
Now, you gotta look what kind of trade offs the altcoins make that claim to be "cheaper, faster, more secure" than bitcoin. Distributed systems are hard to scale. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:43:05


Despite what you might have heard from mainstream media or whatever pundits/outlets there are out there, there is no "crypto community". There are various sub-groups with different interests and "endgame goals" that might overlap, but not necessarily. There are developers, which are rather interested in coding/building stuff, and their reputation in the tech space...  
There are traders/speculators, that are interested in making the most money possible within somewhat short-term frames... There are cypherpunks which are interested in developing solutions empowering privacy and independence from the state/third parties... There are users that just want to use bitcoin to buy stuff online... There are miners that want to maximize their profits from their mining hardware...  
Each of those are also not consistent in themselves and can contain contradictory viewpoints and so on and so on.

In order to pay out of your wallet, there must be funds there in the first place. In order to get funds into your wallet, there must be incoming transactions (inputs). If someone sends you twenty multiple small inputs (each $5 worth, f.ex), and then you want to pay out of your wallet for something $100 worth, all these $5 inputs need to be "packed" into the outgoing transaction.  
This outgoing transaction will be "bigger" in size (because it consists of twenty inputs), compared to a transaction consisting only out of one single input.  
As a counter example, if your wallet was funded with one single incoming transaction worth $100, and you make an outgoing transaction for the same dollar amount, it is "smaller" than the previous example, and you end up paying less fees.
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:35:09
There are a few misunderstandings in your post.  
Bitcoin doesn't "try" to eradicate an economical elite. It gives you an opportunity to transfer value without middlemen, or censorship, or anybody able to stop you.  
The way bitcoin is built (pseudonymous, if not anonymous), it's very difficult to gather statistics like you quoted, and they are most likely wrong.  
It's true though that there are bitcoin addresses that have a lot of bitcoin on them. In majority of cases, those addresses belong to exchanges, which hold bitcoin custodially for large groups of people, making such statistics, again, misleading.

At the moment it seems that people rather decrease the fees, as the "competition" is quite high (a lot of people want to route, which creates a downward pressure in fees).

Thanks for quoting me in the article :)  


that's a good point. The awesome thing in a layered structure is that you can make trade-offs on higher layers, which would not be possible (or undesired) on the basis layer. F.ex giving up trustlessness and censorship resistance for convenience, or adding further layers of privacy, etc etc. You can also experiment and play around on higher layers, while the basis layers stays untouched and unharmed when the experiments go wrong.  
But it's also important to understand what the trade-offs are. In this case, you have to trust the site with payouts, but this doesn't matter for such miniscule amounts. For meaningful amounts, you probably would want a more trustless solution. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:13:01
That's because every method has trade offs and nothing is completely fool proof from every angle.  
Personally, I would never store my seed phrase online. You can lose access to the storage, your encryption method might be flawed, you could forget the encryption method/access information etc.  
Storing the seed offline on a paper is safe against all cyber attack points, but obviously also subject to theft, loss and destruction. You can mitigate it somewhat by hardening your storage method (laminating, using something like cryptosteel), or dividing the seed in multiple parts and store them in different locations.  
But the more complicated you design the storage, the more failure points you introduce. So it's tricky. You have to think careful about the attack points that seem most realistic to you.  
And yes, it's annoying and seems like a lot of hassle (obviously you wouldn't need to think about this for a few dollars). But it's worth it in case you want to store meaningful amounts at some point. Financial sovereignty has its price :)  
And it's good to understand basics of computer security in the first place (regardless of bitcoin), before bad habits and complacency take over.

No, the network doesn't require you to be fair :)  
You just have to "stake" btc to your channel in order to send bitcoins over it, that's all. Kind of like putting cash in your wallet to be able to pay for something off-line. You don't actually stake anything, you just put money into it in order to use it

Well, you do use it for funding and settling transactions, when opening/closing channels, but the actual Lightning transactions are not using the blockchain directly

@_date: 2018-03-24 00:03:15
No no, it doesn't have to do with any particular wallet. It's just when you copy&amp;paste an address, it might be replaced by the malware (while the address is in the clipboard of your computer), and if you enter the wrong address in the "send" field of your wallet, your coins go to the attacker's address. It doesn't matter which wallet you use in this case.  
Always check the address before sending/receiving, even with a hardware wallet (usually something like first and the last 2-4 digits are enough)

The problem is that the best criticisms, in my experience at least, come from people with deep knowledge of bitcoin (Matt Corallo comes to mind, and other Core developers). But although they can be quite vocal about it, I don't think they systematically wrote it out somewhere.  
In any case, I've yet to find a good criticism write up from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. They might exist, but I haven't seen one yet. Although this article comes somewhat close: [Real Bitcoin FUD](  
Then there are some who can offer hints of somewhat valid criticisms, like David Gerard, but it is usually mixed with some downright falsehoods or misunderstandings that I cannot really recommend their writings as legit.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:54:49
Well, you already transferred the $2 within the channel. So if you (or the other party) don't want to use the channel anymore, you can both agree to close it, and the $2 balance in favour of the merchant will settle on-chain on his bitcoin address.  
If you don't agree to close the channel, the vendor still can close it and settle it on-chain, but he will need to wait a bit longer (this is a fraud prevention mechanism, so in case a party wants to cheat and broadcast a "wrong" settling balance, the other party still have enough time to react and "punish" the cheating party... which is ensured by another mechanism)

You are basically sending "approved" (meaning, valid but not yet settled) transactions over the Lightning network. Both partners of one particular channel can choose to settle their channel's balance at any time. Also, the funding transaction is fully settled and valid, so you don't have to trust your channel's partner that he'll send you "fake" bitcoin or whatever.
@_date: 2019-01-26 09:54:12
In order to receive money, you'd need at least one channel having some balance on their end. You can achieve it by various ways: make payments over lightning yourself first; open a channel to an exchange, make a ln payment and then withdraw on-chain; ask (or pay) someone to open a channel with you (so the funds are on their side) etc

Absolutely, it's already possible to open private channels and not announce them to the network. There shouldn't be anything in your way for creating a private network, if that's something desirable (I don't have deep technical insight though, so perhaps some details need to be taken care of first, like your node not announcing itself to the rest of the network, setting up TOR/VPN etc)

You are entitled to your beliefs/views, even if they don't coincide with my own observations; f.ex I don't fall in either of those two groups you mentioned, and most bitcoiners I know don't fall into them either (and this includes devs and other people who work full time in bitcoin space). Your observation might be a case of skewed perception, resulting from observing high-noise/low-signal soc media sources (although I cannot deny that group 1) and 2) exist).

It's not on the "plebeians" level yet. As you see in the OP, it's still in the beta phase 0.x for now, so there needs some work and testing to be done, and improvements around the user interface, until it can be rolled out for less technical users.

Sorry, I don't understand why it's not a technological development?  
But besides that, what is your desired outcome here? You won't be able to stop people using Lightning by words of caution. The genie is out of the bottle and people want to use it. The only way to stop them is to offer an alternative solution for instant and/or micropayments with no or sub-satoshi fees, which on-chain transactions cannot offer. But I see nothing on the horizon offering that, so...
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:16:49
No it doesn't. And even if you think it does, you'd be wise to have some expenses saved up in fiat, because bitcoin might go sideways or down for an unforeseeable amount of time.

I don't see the reason why it should concern me? High divisibility doesn't mean you create something from nothing... If you divide a cake in smaller and smaller parts, it doesn't mean you suddenly have two cakes.. it's still one cake.

It's tricky to explain I guess, if you don't know how inputs/outputs in the transactions work. But basically: you have a receiving address A, which received this dust transaction. You also have a new receiving address B, which received funds from someone else (because your wallet creates a new receiving address for every single transaction). So far, an observer doesn't know that address A and address B belong to the same private key (or to the same entity).  
But now, when you make an outgoing transaction, the address A and address B suddenly get combined into a single transaction, which gives the attacker the information, that they do belong to a single entity/private key. And if the analysis is more sophisticated (and made with other addresses, too), the attacker can make address clusters, telling him which addresses can be grouped together, and he can follow them around better, if he needs to.

Bitcoin is doing amazingly well, as a tech. Mindblowingly well, in fact. Not that it's perfect, far from it, but the development and progress are so much more interesting than the daily/weekly/monthly price fluctuations.

Maybe it's region dependent, but I vaguely remember I paid something like $50 for a Pi set (incl SD card, case and a wireless keyboard), and $100 for a 1tb HDD. I guess you can get it cheaper without the case and perhaps a cheaper HDD, but I haven't looked that deeply into it.

The reason no one answers is because no one knows how the fee dynamics will play out. At the moment it looks like the fees on Lightning will be a fraction of a cent only (a few satoshis). So in order to make any significant amount of money, you'd need to route A LOT of transactions. In order to be able to do that, you'd need to have channels open which are able to handle that traffic (you have to fund those channels with your own money).  
Given that you seem to be on a very tight budget, it's probably not something you want to do.  
That said, there are no really high costs to run a Lightning node, especially on the Pi. The on-chain transaction fees (to open up a channel) are on their lows right now as well, so you can fund a channel for just a few cents. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:55:49
Note that he speaks about "bitcoin economy" needing to be on their own full node, not just simply some people firing up thousands of nodes to "help the network".  
Just having an node up without it being actually used for verifying incoming transactions does not help the network. It might help the user to learn about how the network works, or might be useful for having it handy at a later point in time, but it doesn't help the network in this case.  
Running a node makes you independent of third parties and gives you a higher amount of privacy, **if** you point your wallet at it and have some kind of transactions being verified by it.  
That's just to combat a popular narrative of "running a node to help the network". By any means though, do try to run your full node (and point your wallets at it), there are many guides available. If you don't want it run 24/7 on a dedicated hardware, it's as simple as downloading the current [bitcoin core client]( and let it sync.

That's exactly the point of bitcoin, yes :)  
And Revolut is the third party that keeps the control of your bitcoin. If they disappear, all your bitcoin disappear with it as well, because you are not in control of them. This could be very easily circumvented by having bitcoin on an address of which you control the private key.

I have no idea, but that's not the point. The point is the fake video cannot exist earlier than the original video, and if you're the creator of the original video, you have the chance to timestamp it before any fake gets produced. So you can verifiably claim that your (original) video existed at an earlier point than any other (edited) video, giving your version much more credibility.

This is a neat analogy: [Understanding Lightning Network using an Abacus](  
In a nutshell (in addition to the linked article): Lightning Network consists of channels between individual nodes (run by private persons or entities). Within those channels the connected nodes can send bitcoin (fractions of it) instantly back and forth between each other. They also can send bitcoin to nodes to which they don't have a direct connection, provided that there is an indirect path through their neighbors and neighbor's neighbors.  
To open up such a channel, you have to make a transaction on the bitcoin's blockchain. This means, all the bitcoin (or rather, fractions of a bitcoin, expressed in satoshis) in the channel is "confirmed" to be genuine. It can be sent and received on Lightning without waiting for confirmations. And it can be also "withdrawn" back to on-chain at any time, when you close the Lightning channel.

There are already products like Bitseed (bitcoin node only) and Casa (bitcoin + lightning node) which offer an out-of-the-box node, and it doesn't make much sense for a private person to compete with them with basically the same product.  
Stadicus' guide is more for people who want to have it either cheaper (roughly half the costs of Bitseed/Casa), and/or really trustless, as you build everything yourself and not relying on third parties. You also learn quite a bit in the process, or at least I did. Thanks Stadicus :)

Your wallet creates (or should create) a new address for every transaction that you receive. So if you had ten incoming transactions, you'd have ten different receiving addresses (created from the same "master" key).  
If you have one more receiving transaction, you have yet another new key and the party who is sending you bitcoins will just see their transaction appearing on it.  
This is why it's important not to re-use addresses, as you  potentially lose privacy if you do.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:27:03

Why do you write "BitCoin" in some parts, and "bitcoin" in others? No one writes BitCoin btw ;)  
Also, "blockchain" is not the technology that enables "all the cool features". What enables the cool features is proof-of-work, cryptography, the code itself and incentives for people to protect the network. And yes, blockchain too, but it's less a technology, but something that you can actually download... It's a "read-only" database with a particular way to attach data, and it's completely worthless without the other components (proof-of-work etc)

u/renepickhardt - I think you're doing great work! But I'm curious, is a book a good medium for something that is changing so quick and sometimes quite dramatically in this infancy phase, as the Lightning network?

Quality (= connectedness, uptime) attracts more channels. There necessarily will be nodes which will be better connected than others. But they won't be able to exploit this fact (like taking too high fees or "misbehave" in other ways), because if they do, they'll lose their channels very very quickly in best case, and lose money in the worst case.

I don't see anything in the future that can "handle e-commerce real-time with minimal TX expenses" AND be as decentralised and censorship resistant as Bitcoin. You can trade decentralisation for cheaper transactions, or for some other feature, but as far as censorship resistance, dev power, hashrate, decentralisation and network effect go, bitcoin is still on top. Also, [Lindy effect]( 
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:42:47


The transaction backlog on-chain shouldn't have any effect on the difficulty on the "thwarting" of the cheating attempt, in my understanding. The only thing I can think of is that if the fee is too low, you might have to wait a little longer for the settling transaction to be confirmed. But it shouldn't be a problem for the Lightning mechanism itself.  


I suppose since you have a fully valid on-chain transaction when a channel is closed, you can do CPFP. The second question I assume yes; why shouldn't miner honor those?  


The default time frame seems to be 144 blocks (24 hours), but my understanding is that you can configure it yourself, so you can set up a week or two. I also think it depends on the particular implementation of the protocol, of which there are currently three and I am only somewhat familiar with one of those. 
Disclaimer: I'm only an enthusiastic noob, so no guarantees all this is 100% correct. Just my understanding of things :)  
P.S.: Just saw that there is actually an example of thwarting a "cheat attempt" (wasn't really a cheat) on the frontpage here:

Yep. I don't need my coffee transaction to be recorded forever in a block on a tamper resistant, immutable ledger, so I'm fine with that trade off. If, however, I am transferring my life savings to another wallet, I sure as hell will make it on-chain. But it's good to have options for microtransactions and for less important ones on a second layer. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:36:56


Have been wondering the same.  
Luckily, as you mentioned, Lightning Labs does not equal Lightning Network and there are different implementations. Also, they haven't ICO'd and raised a very humble sum from the investors (2.5m), compared to the insanity of the funding sizes in the crypto space lately, so I am quite positive about their integrity.
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:03:47
Partially agree (I also will probably use on-chain to make large transactions). But LN is bitcoin, you transact with actual bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:59:49
I don't know tbh. From my limited point of view, it seems that devs don't prioritize pc/laptops for "light wallets" (without a node), but rather smartphones. And pc/laptop more for the "full wallets" (which you need a node for). But this might be wrong and someone might get an easy to use wallet out soon. Tough to say in an open source environment :)

You seem to confuse an important detail. While I agree that storing bitcoin on an exchange is a stupid idea, having a "third party wallet" is not as bad, provided this wallet gives you full control of your private keys (which the overwhelming majority of wallets does.. even if some of them suck badly in other regards).  
Your private keys are not dependent on the wallet where you "hold" them. If you know your seed phrase, you can just delete the wallet and import the keys to another one, or just hold the keys offline.  
But the best practice is to have a hardware wallet and a safe back up of your seed phrase. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:23:24
Nr 3: running a full, verifying node is actually very easy. Just download the [Bitcoin Core software]( and let it sync.  
Connecting your hardware wallet to it (so you don't have to rely on Trezor's server, and also don't need to leak your privacy to them) is a bit trickier. You'll need the [Electrum wallet]( and [Electrum Personal Server]( for that (see also [this explainer]( on Bitcoin Magazine).  
Don't worry, it all sounds a bit confusing, but you'll wrap your head around it ;) Ask here or r/bitcoinbeginners if something's unclear.  
P.S.: another link you might be interested in is [the beginner's guide to Lightning on a Raspberry Pi]( It's a guide how to set up a bitcoin node, a Lightning node, Electrum Personal Server etc, all in one, on a dedicated, cheap hardware (so it doesn't interfere with your computer work and you can let it run 24/7)

Re: hardware wallet: yes, you should be fine waiting for a few days until you get your wallet.  
Just a small advice: when you get your wallet, consider sending a small amount on it first, then wipe it (make sure you wrote down your seed before that!) and then re-enter the seed to bring your balance back on the hardware wallet. This way you learn how to handle the whole process without having bigger sums on the line, and it'll give you a bigger peace of mind, knowing how it all works. 


Yes, it depends which location you are at, though. Just a few names of major ones: Bitstamp, Gemini, Kraken.

By default, just the transaction fees that you would pay for a regular on-chain transactions. There are things being thought of like [channel factories]( and I assume it will (is?) possible for your channel partner or some third party to pay the fees for you, so you can fund your channel without fees or they fund your channel etc (if you are their customer f.ex). 
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:26:25


There are some best practices, like using receiving addresses only once, trying to avoid KYC services if possible, etc.  
The most effective practice though is to use a wallet that allows something called "coin control". This means, the wallet gives you options to choose between different inputs, when you are about to make a new outgoing transaction. So f.ex you could use only those inputs that are already "tainted" with your personal information, for a certain types of transactions (if you want to send them to another KYC compliant merchant).   
For other types of transactions you might want to select inputs that are **not** tainted with your personal information and so on.  
This is all a bit tricky, but doable if you value your privacy (which you should do). The most advanced and user friendly wallet right now is [Wasabi wallet]( It not only allows you to do coin control, but also something called "coinjoin". Which basically mixes your inputs with the inputs of other users, to such a degree that a chain analysis software cannot differ anymore between your inputs and the inputs of other users. There are some videos on youtube that explain it a little better, as well as some info floating around on r/bitcoin (and I think Wasabi might have their own subreddit).  
edit: I misread your question (in my quote) thinking you are asking for a better (more private) way to do transactions, sorry! :) 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:08:08
A bit off-topic, but an important point to consider is that one transaction can include multiple outputs (recipients). So a transaction is not always equal a transaction. "Compressing" multiple recipients into one transaction is called "batching".  
Another point to consider is that one transaction can transfer any amount of bitcoin, and a tx with a larger value costs the same as one with a very low value. So very low-value transactions can be somewhat cost-prohibitive, while high-value transactions are incentivized more.  
As Nic Carter made the analogy about what is being transferred on the network: "it's containerships, not parcels"
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:24:41


The whole point of bitcoin is to be not dependent on someone else's server :)  As you do more research, you hopefully will understand this point. The basic thing is that your bitcoins are secured by yourself, not a third party.  
If you know how to back up your private key (don't worry, it's not THAT complicated) and have a basic minimum of some security mechanism on your phone (pin lock, not downloading random apps all the time etc), you should be fine with an online wallet. But you shouldn't trust an online wallet with your life savings in any case.

Minus the amount which is reserved for fees when closing the channel. So if you put in 1 btc, you'd be able to send something like 0.999992 btc (you can send those back and forth indefinitely though, in whichever amounts you like, and as often as you like, or use them for routing etc)
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:52:03
Well, it depends how you create your private key. If you just take the first 24 words from the [Bip39 word list]( (which is used in many/most modern wallets nowadays), you'll get a valid private key, but it's obviously not secure (because it is created by a very simple, non-random pattern).

I don't have any stats at hand, but I highly suspect that number is incorrect. I assume one of the reasons is that there are custodial addresses, such as exchanges, holding vast amounts of bitcoin, but the actual ownership of those bitcoins is distributed among the users of the respective exchange. Also, Satoshi's coins (I believe around 500 000 btc) are also skewing such stats.  
Another reason is the pseudonymous nature of the network, making such statistics difficult to gauge. I agree that it seems a male dominated field, but that &gt;95% figure I don't see it holding up from my experiences with the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:45:51
I don't think there's anything announced at the moment.. I suspect that at least LND won't have any breaking updates anymore, but other implementations might (although not necessarily). Pure speculation on my part and I'm not an "insider" in any way, so might be completely off here :)

I don't like some of your conclusions and I disagree with a few points that you made. F.ex,  


You will see your bitcoin transaction instantly as well, it just needs time for the settlement. You would be wrong to think that a Visa transaction is settled instantly, it can take up to days "behind the scenes". 
But you've seem to have read more than me on Austrian economics and you seem to argue reasonably, so I'll upvote :)  
One other thing though, you compare "bitcoin core" with "bitcoin cash" which is misleading as well. Bitcoin Core is a name for an implemenation of the Bitcoin protocol, while bitcoin cash is a name for an altcoin. It would be correct to either compare "bitcoin" to "bitcoin cash", or "bitcoin core" to another implementation like "bitcoin ABC". Small, but important distinction :)
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:29:45
Argh, you can't transfer bitcoin in or out from Revolut. You hold only crypto "IOU's" on it. Pretty much useless in that regard. But it's useful for depositing fiat and paying in foreign currencies, as you don't pay exchanging fees from your "base" currency.

No, you don't have anything at stake. Perhaps you are confusing Lightning with Proof Of Stake?  
In Lightning you can lose something only by doing something stupid or due to a potential bug (it's only in beta stadium at the moment).

I also don't like the fact that I have to give my name and bank address to an unknown third party (the actual seller/buyer). Privacy concerns, but also if this seller/buyer gets involved with the law for some reason, now my bank account is potentially under investigation.  
Doesn't apply to cash trades, obviously.

Well, it kinda defeats the whole purpose for which bitcoin was developed.. To be your own financial sovereignty and have control over your bitcoins. If you don't own the private keys for your bitcoins, they are not your bitcoins :)  
Revolut just gives you numbers that move up or down with the price of bitcoin. There is nothing behind those numbers. It's actually quite misleading, if I think more about this.  
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:05:06
But who is owing what to whom?  
If I give you a fully signed, valid transaction, which transfers funds from my wallet to yours, and you are free to broadcast this transaction to the network at any time you wish... What is the "owe" part of that ordeal? You own the funds the instant I gave you that transaction, and I don't "owe" you anything after that (nor you me)
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:48:01
Holy shit, I feel not comfortable answering that. Amount of bitcoins I hold, the wallets I use, if those wallets are password protected/encrypted or not... Nothing against your intentions OP, but this just feels such a bad OpSec to answer all that :D

Impressive analysis! :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:21:56
You are withdrawing value from the "legacy" financial system and gaining freedom from it (to a degree at least), or at the very least keeping your options diverse. Also by holding bitcoin you become interested in the network to keep/ appreciate in value by contributing to the network (code, education, mining, running a node etc etc, or by simply holding bitcoin)... Which in turn profits you as a bitcoin holder.  
Again, I don't know exactly what the definition of meritocracy is, but I would think that since bitcoin is  
* opt-in, you only participate in the network if you find it valuable (financially, intellectually, politically etc), not by force or habit (like our current monetary systems)    
* rewarding your participation in direct or indirect ways  
it would fit the "meritocracy" description
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:24:51
No, you can turn your "bitcoin IOU" back to fiat in the app and then cash out the fiat. But you cannot (at this point, at least) buy bitcoin and withdraw bitcoin from the app.

There will be nodes with more connections than other nodes, but the cool thing is that they won't be able to exploit their status as a "meganode". If they take too high of a fee, payments will be routed over nodes that take less/no fees. If a meganode go offline or behaves maliciously, it just will be routed around.  
So at the moment, I don't see why a clustering of channels through some meganodes will be a problem, as long as it stays trivial for users to run their own nodes and connect to any node they desire.

I'm legitimately concerned this could be spun up into some court case, prohibiting/restricting the use of full nodes (which store the full blockchain) in some jurisdictions. We can only hope that if such reference court case finds place, "our guy" will have a good lawyer with an excellent understanding of the technology, which is probably hard enough.  
For miners it shouldn't matter because they don't need to store the blockchain, but full nodes are different.

@_date: 2018-02-10 14:54:20
You alone are responsible for your contributions to the path bitcoin will take in the future. It starts with your choice of wallet, your choice of storage, if and how you contribute to the code development/testing/reviewing, education of your peers, running your own full node etc etc.  
If we want to be free and have financial sovereignty, we have to put in some effort, too, and not trust our valuable bitcoins to third parties. It's all your choice, don't forget that! Don't worry too much what others might or might not do, or if bitcoin might be misappropriated... Just do the thing that you think is right :) 
By the way, I love Revolut myself, but just not for buying/storing bitcoin (which is in my view, not "bitcoin" anyway).

No no, the command just gives out the possible routes, just as a stat gimmick (you do `lncli queryroutes [node_id] [amount_in_sat]` and it shows you how many possible routes exist from your node to the target node for the entered amount of satoshis. The routing does the client, don't think there's a way to choose manually?

It's similar to having cash in your wallet that can be stolen by physical force. Is it a "major flaw" or, rather less dramatic, a trade-off between security and usability? You can put your cash in a bank vault so it's safe, but then in order to pay someone you have to actually go to the bank, unlock the vault, get the cash, go back and pay the said person.  
So you accept the "major flaw" for day-to-day transactions, or something that requires a quick transfer etc, but of course you wouldn't carry your life savings in cash in your wallet.  
Different use cases, different trade offs.

Synopsis:  
 &gt; In the Bitcoin discourse community, much of the fud that is dissipated is cyclical and completely refuted. One purpose of this article is to show that there is whole set of unique concerns within the Bitcoin community that are being discussed constantly. It is a truly vibrant discourse! This article also aims to document new forms of fud that need to be addressed by the Bitcoin community. If these points are not addressed, Bitcoin will struggle to gain traction among new potential adopters. So instead of rehashing the same old boring narratives like “mining death spirals” and “proof of work is not energy efficient,” let’s look at some less cyclical and much more interesting fud narratives that may emerge as Bitcoin advances.

Very short version: decentralised, trustless system seem not to scale well on-chain without trade-offs in decentralisation, security or other areas. People don't want to give up these attributes, hence other solutions are being tried out.  
In the long run, on-chain scaling solutions will probably be employed, too, though.

You also could make the case that Lightning attracts use cases that would never be possible on-chain (as I wrote earlier, those micro-transactions, or tx in need of instant delivery etc). So by opening a channel you still have "1 transaction 1 fee", but everything else that happens in the channel wouldn't have found usage on-chain anyway, so you could argue that Lightning only introduces new use cases, instead of "stealing" on-chain use cases.  
Granted, it's a speculative point, but so is the whole debate so why not.. :)

Why forced to sell? You still can withdraw to your own wallet (shouldn't be keeping it on an exchange anyway) or your own bank, if you have anything on there.

@_date: 2018-03-12 23:39:59
It gets created by the wallet of your choice (theoretically, you can create it yourself using a source of entropy, such as a dice f.ex, so you are not really dependent on a wallet here). After the wallet has created the private key, it automatically creates a receiving address, derived from that key. And then you can cash out your coins from Coinbase onto this new address in your wallet. I hope it doesn't sound too complicated... Because it isn't :) most of it happens in the background, I'm just describing it in detail for you to understand how it works. 
The important thing is that since no one knows your private key, no one can take them away from you. But also this means that if you ever lose your private key, your coins are gone. The good news is, you can back up your private key by a 24 words seed phrase (you'll see what it is when you install and set up your wallet).
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:30:27
Phew, no one can say really. It's a gradual roll out (right now only developers and technically minded/curious people, then by and by less skilled people will join, as software matures). Also tough to say because there are three independent (but compatible) implementations of the protocol, and different wallets, which are all at dif. levels of development.   
The point is, there is no single "finished product" which is being deployed on a specific time schedule.
My **guess** would be something between few months and end of this year, before an average user without a full node and without particular technical knowledge will be able to smoothly transact on the lightning network, but my guess is really as good as yours. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:09:31
The apps that you use are by companies who have no interest in you being anonymous, as it would violate their KYC/AML obligations. If you want to buy bitcoin anonymously, you have to use other channels (or earn it for any kind of goods or services that you can provide).  
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:55:42
Yep, gotcha... Thanks for detailed explanation :)  


Certainly seems like it! That said, I am figuring out/doing things that I have assumed to be too complicated for me just a few days ago... So it's all a constant progress :)

If this gets detected, you "win" their balance in the channel as a penalty.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:19:03


By "directing part or all of the funds to a different address" do you mean broadcasting an older state of the channel (where they have a more favorable balance to their side)?  


Yes, you are correct, that's the more precise way to describe it than I did :)  


That's a good point actually, I haven't considered that previously. Although it still doesn't seem right to call it an IOU, because it is fully in my power to broadcast the balance at any time I wish, so I am not relying on my partner to actually pay their debt (or relying on them to stay honest, as it is quite trivial to thwart their cheating attempt). But I have to think about it some more now, appreciate your input.

@_date: 2018-02-11 15:35:35
If you buy something worth $100 and pay it in $5 bills, your transaction is "bigger" than if you paid it in one single $100 bill. In bitcoin, if you received many small inputs (like many $5 "bills") and you want to send $100 worth, your transaction consists of many of those inputs and has much more bits than a transaction consisting of only one input and one output. There are more factors to that, but this is the rough example how it works

So just to paraphrase in order to not mess anything up:  
1. I create a "bitcoin_mainnet" folder on my Pi's HDD and copy the contents of my "bitcoin core" folder from my laptop into this new folder (will I be fine if I copy all the contents, or will I need only the "blocks", "chainstate" and "database" folders?)  
2. I open the newly copied bitcoin.conf file on my Pi and copypaste the contents from your guide (except for the "testnet=0" line) and save the file  
3.  Now with the symbolic link removal I am not entirely sure what to do. Do I just type "rm .bitcoin"? Or "rm /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin"?  
4. When I successfully removed the symbolic link, I type "ln -s /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin" to create a new symbolic link to the mainnet directory - correct? Since the newly created bitcoin.conf file is also in the mainnet directory, I don't need to link to the .conf file explicitly, right?
5. At which step should I update to bitcoin core 0.16? Is this the right way to update?    






Sorry for the wall of questions :) And thanks a lot once again!

The development progress is far from "putting it out and see what happens", as far as I see it. The devs have been quite responsible and thorough with their code and the bug fixing work has been enormous (judged by github activity etc).  
The true implications of the new technology on the macro scale only time will show. But this is also true for bitcoin itself (Satoshi couldn't foresee how exactly his invention would influence the world), as well as for other disruptive technologies like the internet.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:46:26
I don't know how it works on the technical side, but it seems that it just (custodially) holds balances, linked to reddit usernames, and you can use the balance linked to your name with a `!lntip &lt;satoshis&gt;`command (of course, first you need to deposit some funds into your balance).

I think it's important to make it clear that this is not a sentiment against scaling in general or even bigger block sizes, but only through a reasonable proposal and with broad support of developers and users. If this point is not made clear, it will look like that people are against increasing the blocks/scaling in general, which is not the case (at least as I understand the comments here and the general sentiment on Twitter etc)

Thanks for the detailed explanation :)  
I was curious if the idea of a block size increase in general (beyond SegWit) further down the road is something that is rejected by the community in this sub and the developer community, or is it merely the manner in which it has been proposed at the NYA, which seems to implicitly try to "fire Core". Your post has been helpful in other regards but I am not sure if I found the answer to my specific question. Sorry if I didn't formulate it precise enough :)

What are you complaining about? ATMs are convenient/not requiring ID (depends on the ATM though) and you are paying a price for convenience/privacy.

The electricity costs are very very minimal (don't confuse this with mining, where the energy costs are enormous!).  
You probably won't make any significant money with your lightning node. The incentive is to be in control of your own funds without relying on a third party, contribution to/participation in a network and the joy of tinkering with hard/software. :)  
Check out this guide, if you're still interested: [Beginner's Guide to Lightning on a Raspberry Pi]( It's for testnet at the moment, but the mainnet version will be published in the next few days. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:03:28
I'm not an expert myself, so take it all with a grain of salt :)  
I understand it so that the knowledge of one single node about the whole network is just not perfect in reality, because there are nodes coming on- and going off-line frequently, channels being opened and closed, channels being re-balanced and so on. Information like that has to spread over the network and if some things happen "on the other side" of the network, to which this particular node has no direct connection, it might be that the node is not entirely up-to-date. The information has yet to reach the node.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:00:25
They are kinda separate, yes.  
There are transactions being broadcasted by users, and a miner takes those transactions, packs them into a block and then tries to solve the puzzle. If he succeeds, he gains the block rewards (12.5 btc currently) plus all the fees from the transactions in that block.  
He doesn't actually have to validate the transactions, but if he includes invalid transactions into the block, this block will be rejected by the nodes (and other miners) and the miner won't gain any rewards (he will lose money on the electricity consumption).  
So you kinda can separate validation and block rewards, but a miner has an economical incentive to make sure he doesn't process invalid transactions. It's kinda unlikely anyway though, since an invalid transaction won't be broadcasted by nodes in the first place.  
*disclaimer: I'm a noob in mining myself, so this is only a very basic description and might be wrong :)*

That's not correct. Variance plays a huge role even for top crushers (10bb/100) on a very significant time scale (1 mio hands). You can plug in different numbers in order to see how much deviation from the observed/assumed winrate there can be even in the long run:   
It's correct to describe it as a game of both skill and luck, where skill factor is coming out more pronounced over longer time periods, but never reaches 100% (luck, or variance, is always involved, even on very large time scales/sample sizes)
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:21:12

In short:  
* by using it as the store of value  
* withdrawing my bitcoins out of the market, making them more scarce/valuable  
* exercising my choice to (partially) withdraw myself from the traditional banking/fiat system
I guess it depends of the definition of "using it" and if the definition is "using = transacting", I would argue it is too narrow, but that's just my humble opinion :)

This is confusing... So you sent them bitcoin, but it was too late and they sent it back to you, I understand?  
Did they send less than you originally send? If yes, it might be a small fee for the miners (transaction fee). If it's a substantial amount there might be some error on merchant's side, in which case you should contact them directly (which you apparently did?).  
What do 30% refer to? 30% less from your original payment?  
I guess it could be helpful if you find out the transaction id and post it here. If you are using blockchain.info, it's the first blue string of digits and letters in the upper left corner.

You can either just download the Bitcoin Core client from the bitcoin.org link as suggested earlier, which is the most easiest solution.  
Or, if you want to have a node on a dedicated hardware (which can run 24/7 without interfering with your work etc), or perhaps even run a Lightning node, I warmly can recommend this guide for setting up a node on a Raspberry Pi for beginners:     
If you are really lazy, you could order a pre-configured node from Bitseed, but in my opinion they are too pricey (around $300 afaik) for something that I can build myself (Raspberry Pi set + HDD should cost aroun $100).

After you ran your coins through a coinjoin, please keep in mind there still are various ways to leak your privacy afterwards: f.ex, if you send them to your trezor/ledger and don't use them to connect to your own full node, the wallets will connect to the nodes of the hardware manufacturers... Who might also have your name and home address (if you ordered your hardware wallet from them directly), and they might be able to link your new, "clean" addresses to your name.  
It might be quite unlikely, but just something to keep in mind when defending your privacy.

I had to google what those were :)  
Anyway, I tried it recently as well and my internet connection is shitty and I cannot do anything about it. That's bottleneck nr 1.  
Then I have to use an external HDD because I don't have &gt;200gb space on my laptop left. Although I am almost done downloading the whole blockchain, the blocks need to be indexed/synced, which is painfully slow, because the USB connection is an extreme bottleneck nr 2.  
Storage is not the main bottleneck, but if the blockchain grows even faster than now, it will surely become an issue 10, 20 years from now, and kicking the can further down the road, hoping that by then everything will take care of itself is irresponsible, in my opinion. 
Granted, these are hardware issues that could be improved on my side, but I am really thankful that I can participate in the network with humble budget/hardware, because otherwise my node very likely wouldn't have gone online and I am sure many others wouldn't either, or would have gone offline if they couldn't handle the traffic.  
It seems to me that keeping hardware requirements low is very helpful to keep the network decentralised and accessible.

Decentralisation is not a binary property. It's more of a spectrum, and bitcoin is the most decentralised asset/currency/whatever that has been invented. It doesn't mean it can't be more decentralised: hashing power is still quite centralised f.ex. Further decentralisation in geographical locations of full nodes is also desirable and so on.

The main and the most important difference between the tipping bot account and a proper wallet is: you control your own private keys with a proper wallet and don't have to trust anybody, while a tipping bot account is a custodial solution (the creator of the bot controls the private keys).  
This means, you have to trust the bot creator to not scam you, while with a proper wallet you alone control your keys (= your transactions).   
A custodial solution might be more convenient and simple, but the trade off is that it is not trustless.

Implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, you can find all the code here:  
  
(it's a software which runs on the Bitcoin protocol, not a "coin" like Roger is trying to depict it)  
Just to clarify further:  
there are different coins - **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Bitcoin Cash/Bcash (BCH)**, and there are different implementations for those two, like Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots (for Bitcoin) and Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited (for Bitcoin Cash/Bcash).  
Comparing Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash doesn't make sense, since the former is an implementation, and the latter is a coin. You could compare f.ex Bitcoin Core with Bitcoin ABC, or Bitcoin with Bitcoin Cash.  
Hope this is not too confusing :D

I am not the right guy to ask I guess, because I am myself quite new in the space. But block size increase seems a much much more contentious and technically more dangerous solution than an implementation of a second layer. First, block size increase is temporary solution anyway. Second, it has immediate effects on crippling the decentralisation of the network (nodes drop off with increased bandwidth/storage burden). Third, it's contentious and users either have to keep up with it or "fork off", which makes it a much more "forced" solution than second layer, which you are free to use or not use.  
You write  


But how is a block size increase not something that users are "forced to comply with"? You don't have to comply with Lightning at all, just don't use it! While with block size increase everyone is "forced" to comply.   
That being said, I am not dogmatically against a responsible, unrushed block size increase after all other solutions have been explored. But it seems to me not the best solution at this moment.

**edit: nevermind plz, I think it works now, although I still have no idea why :D (I deleted ".bitcoin" a few times and tried to create it anew, so that seems to have done the trick)**
So I am at steps 3 resp 4 now.  
I tried to remove the symbolic link with "cd /home/bitcoin" and "rm .bitcoin", and then creating a new one with "ln -s /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin"  
After I checked with "ls -la" though, it didn't show up   
So I tried to repeat the steps, removing the symbolic link again, but now it says "rm: cannot remove '.bitcoin': Is a directory".  
When just trying to create a new sym. link it says "ln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin_mainnet': File exists"  
Doing something wrong here?  
No idea if it's helpful, but if I go to "cd .bitcoin" and type "ls -la", it shows the following:   
edit: I figured out I can do "unlink bitcoin_mainnet", which allows me to create a symbol link again, but it still creates a symlink as shown in the latest screenshot. So something seems to be off here? Should .bitcoin have the content that it has on the screenshot at all?  
edit2: so I understand now that there shouldn't be any files inside ".bitcoin". I deleted it using "rm -rf .bitcoin" and tried to create a symlink again, but again this fills the ".bitcoin" file/folder with the stuff that is visible on the screenshot.

You can find all kinds of evil shit on the internet, and still it is a transformative and immensely helpful tech for humanity... Same with blockchain.

@_date: 2017-09-25 08:01:18
If you cannot answer this question for yourself (or at least have a vague understanding of the answer), I'd suggest to do nothing but reading up on bitcoin for a couple of days. Then read some more. Understand how and where you'd want to keep your bitcoins, how to secure them. Ask questions, keep on reading. Then pick an altcoin and read about it, too. Don't just buy stuff to "diversify" (they mostly move together more or less). Buy only something which you understand at least on some basic level.   
But if you just want a basic answer from a random internet person, I'd say 100% bitcoin and forget about it for a couple of years.

Yeah, I also have a Seagate :)  
One thing though: I had troubles syncing and fully indexing the blockchain to the external HDD over USB 2.0. It would have taken days, so I have done it mostly on my laptop's SSD and transferred it to the HDD later, when it was downloaded and synced fully.  
It may be that USB 3.0 is a little better in that regard. Or if you don't mind to just let your node/laptop run for a few days, it doesn't matter, I guess.

I guess it depends on how you measure it? All the tools necessary for printing/storing/securing/transferring physical money, buildings full of staff, endless paper trails etc etc..

No, it's not a scam, but it's not a good place to buy cryptocurrencies, because all you get is a kind of certificate... Not the actual bitcoin which you can move onto your private key.

My running Pi is not doing anything useful right now and I've finished syncing the bitcoin core mainnet version on my laptop. I was wondering if I could just switch my Pi onto the mainnet (just in order to keep it up-to-date) by copying the "blocks", "chainstate" and "database" folders from my laptop to the "bitcoin core" folder on the Pi and changing the bitcoin.conf file to "testnet=0"?  
I don't need the Eclair part to be functional for a while, just wanted to switch the bitcoin core part from testnet to mainnet on my Pi, but I don't want to mess up anything in the process, hence the question..  
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:30:41
You chose quite an unfortunate title. It is very dramatic and jumps to extreme conclusions based on some vague assumptions/ideas and on many unknowns (f.ex. the usage of Lightning network and how much influence it will have on on-chain fees).  
Perhaps bitcoin/lightning usage will explode in such a way that transactions for closing and opening channels will be so many that they will make up for declining block rewards. If not, perhaps on-chain transactions will become so "unfairly cheap" that it becomes reasonable for entities to put non-transactional data onto the immutable blockchain.   
But it's all speculation at this point (exactly as your reasoning is speculative). We have to wait and see.  
Bitcoin technology is permissionless, that was its whole point. If people want to implement/use Lightning, no one can stop it and if technological development leads to the decline of bitcoin, so be it.. It hasn't deserved to live if it can be killed like that.   
Besides, people have been *screaming* how high on-chain fees will kill bitcoin.. And now low on-chain fees will kill bitcoin?

Yes, I understand that. I am asking if the same method of expressing my private key in a 24 words phrase would work for expressing my public key as well? So if I want to give someone my receiving address, instead of a QR code or a string of symbols, I could give that person a list of 12/24 words instead. Would make transactions over telephone or whatever a little easier.  
edit: "seed" is perhaps a bad choice of a word. What I am trying to find out is if I can encode my receiving address in a more convenient way than a long string of symbols or QR code :)

Yes, good points. I haven't considered the possibility of the "core chain" going dead at all, but I guess it's &gt;0%. Still, SW2X has both to come to life AND stay alive, while current chain is already alive, so the probability of SW2X not happening at all for whatever reasons is greater.  
Anyway, I'm not planning to swap anything, nor do I support SW2X in whatever form, just wanted to point out the skew in the bet offer, at least in my opinion :)

Eclair as implementation will be send and receive, but Eclair as mobile wallet will be receive only at the beginning, so I've read in their Gitter. 
I am guessing the reason is that because their wallet is streamlined to be very intuitive and beginner friendly, they wanted to avoid the technical humps and bumps of the receiving function at the start. Only guessing though.

Well, you need a node to verify that all your transactions are indeed valid but it (the node) is not involved in the process of mining itself (although miner will run a node also just for verifying the transactions). My understanding is not complete, so I guess it's better to read up on it yourself or maybe someone with more detailed explanation feels to chime in

@_date: 2018-02-12 18:03:49
The comparison is valid up to a point, yes.  
The difference is, I'd say, that bitcoin's properties make it possible for its holders to keep full control and autonomy over the coins, so the way Revolut and Robinhood are selling it is contrary to that idea.  
If people want to use it this way, it's totally fine of course, as long as they understand that they are not actually holding any real bitcoin in this case.

In Revolut's case, there is plainly no withdrawal at all, doesn't matter if they "verify all info" or not. Robinhood seems intentionally vague on that in the moment (see my "edit2" in the OP).

But no one is "fundamentally" alters bitcoin? Second layer makes use of the bitcoin technology, it doesn't touch the bitcoin protocol at all!  
If I decide to give you a fully valid transaction in a written form, that you can broadcast to the blockchain at any point you wish.. I am not altering the bitcoin protocol, but utilising it in a way that I see appropriate in this particular situation for whatever reasons.  
In no way do I hinder the protocol in its work, nor do I force you to accept this kind of transaction, nor forcing you to transact in the same way. But if others want to transact this way, they surely should be free to do so? And in fact, no one can hinder them, precisely because they use bitcoin's permissionless, censorship protocol. They are **using** it, not **altering** it. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:50:25
What do you mean by "generating a second set of seed words"? I assume you created a second address (on mycelium).. Did you transfer your balance on that second address? If yes, and the original address (with the lost seed phrase) is empty, and you don't intend to use that address ever again - then yes, it doesn't matter that you lost your seed words for it.

Aha, thanks. So dilution means here mining of new coins by the miners, and since the users/holders accept this mining as an ingrained part of the system, they are carrying the costs of inflation/dilution (since new coins on the market increase the supply = lower the price), right?
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:32:36
Multiple reasons. Some are:  
- there are not enough possibilities to oust bad actors/scammers from the space. That's why communities are perceived so obnoxious and loud sometimes, which is true, but also serves a purpose of self-regulation/self-defence.  
- ego, magnified by the anonymity of the internet  
- actors with some interests/incentives to stir up shit in a particular community, to cause divisiveness and chaos (and then point out how bad this community is, and how community of "coin Y" is so much better and flourishing)

Hmm, I guess I'd download the mainnet blockchain in multiple time periods (when you use the Bitcoin Core client, you can just shut it down when you are reaching your cap and start again when you want), or closer to the end of the month, when you know that you'll be ok with 30% of your internet speed for a few days (you can leave it downloading over night, too).

Well, sure, I guess this would work, but I don't see what you are trying to achieve?  
First of all, a wallet is simply a software which holds your private key (= access to your coins). You can do whatever you like with your wallet, but usually you cannot buy and sell coins directly through your wallet: you need to send them from your wallet to an exchange (or to your trade counterparty).  
Secondly, every time you buy or sell coins on a KYC compliant platform, they are able to link your ID to those coins, so I don't see the reason why all the steps in-between? Or maybe I misunderstand what you are describing :)

Don't feel overwhelmed with the amount information.. We've all been there (and still are! no one really can say he "gets" bitcoin, it has so many layers and implications). Also, don't ever feel shy to ask any kind of questions, as long as you are willing to read the answers. No matter how harsh the online environment seems here, there always tons of people willing to help :)

If, let's say, 90% of the miners do indeed mine at loss, because it creates greater rewards for them in the future, wouldn't it create a huge incentive for the individual miners to deviate from that strategy, because they can mine profitable on the original bitcoin chain AND having the rest of the group mine on the other chain at loss for the future rewards? And as soon as one miner group splits off the cartel, the other ones will follow, because no one wants to mine at loss and be the idiot in the end.  
This splitting off to the profitable chain (assuming it's the original bitcoin chain) could only be prevented by means of coercion, use of force or legal means etc, but it's not an optimal strategy from game theory perspective. Game theory perspective solution in such case is to deviate (= mine the most profitable chain). At least, from the assumptions that I have at my disposal right now, which are probably incomplete.

I don't see how it undermines the permanence and accuracy of the blockchain. The blockchain stays as immutable and accurate as it is, regardless if I decide to make some transactions off-chain or not.  
If I want to make an instant transaction without fees and where I (or the merchant) don't want to wait for the confirmations, I have now the option of using lightning. If I am transacting my life savings, I will surely use on-chain, because I don't care for speed or cheap fees (or not as much).  
Both scenarios serve different use cases. How is having more options undermining the security of bitcoin's blockchain?

@_date: 2017-10-03 07:59:27
The other party exposes themselves to two events of risk (fork happening/not happening and SW2X coin succeeding/not succeeding), while you bear only the latter risk event. This makes the trade highly unfair in your favour. You'd need to give better odds to find any takers or agree to the cancellation of the trade in case of fork not happening. Nothing to do with convictions, just basic math/odds/risk analysis.

What you mean is called "batching": constructing a transaction with multiple recipients (most exchanges do that f.ex, to save costs). It has nothing to do with Lightning directly.  


I don't have any math at hand, but I assume it is orders of magnitude indeed. I mean you and I can open a direct channel without even connecting to any other node on the network and simply send a transaction back and forth every second just for fun, and it would be already more tx's than an average bitcoin block carries every ten minutes (although of course our transactions wouldn't carry much economical sense... but they're nevertheless possible).

Phew, I wish I could help! There are still many quirks in the implementations, as well as all kinds of different scenarios where it is something with the set up itself.  
If no one answers here, probably your best bet would be to check out the github pages of the respective software and have a look at opened issues, or perhaps open an issue yourself... Also check if there are slack/gitter channels and ask for help there, or try to contact the article author/software author on Twitter etc... It's an untested field for now, so unfortunately, no straight-forward manuals how to fix things in case of issues exist yet.

Wait, so if I consider bitcoin to be a better store of value than fiat, or if I consider it "sound money"... And on the other hand, I have some fiat money... Why should I give away something that I value more, instead of giving away something that I am valuing less (fiat money)? This doesn't make sense.  
Other example: if I have USDs and Bolivars, and I can pay a merchant in both... I will sure as hell pay in Bolivars because it will be stupid to pay in USD while the Bolivars on your hands are depreciating in value every ten seconds.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:15:20
Ah, I think I got it... So you sent them fiat money through Coinbase, which got converted to bitcoin by Coinbase, and the company send you bitcoin back, so with the price going down, you have less fiat money than you originally sent?  
Phew, not sure what to do here. I'd just keep the bitcoin and see if the price bounces back soon.. If you don't wanna do that, I guess the only option would be to write to Coinbase and demand your fiat back but I'm not sure how your chances of success are here.  
Alternatively, perhaps try and convince the company to actually send you the product for the amount of bitcoin that you have now?

If you build up your business on being dependent on low fees, and bitcoin doesn't accommodate your idea on how it works - it might be that your idea is wrong/unsustainable, and not that the bitcoin network has "failed".  
Plenty of companies thought that they could rely on the network to accommodate their "low fees" business model, but it turned out to be not supported by reality. I would say it doesn't mean that bitcoin failed (on the contrary).  
I mean, I see your point and I don't think we'll find an agreement, based on what I understand from your posts, which is also fine :) Bitcoin is bigger than the "low fees" usage model (and it doesn't fit that model very well imo, at least not on the base layer), but I guess we're free to disagree here.
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:59:27
1) you still need to download and verify everything before you can prune it down (although it happens as-you-go)  
2) quite a bit of advanced usecases require txindex and a non-pruned blockchain  
3) independently of node maintainers: larger blocks also slow down propagation of blocks (between nodes and between miners), leading to increased likelihood of orphaned blocks, re-orgs and chainsplits

@_date: 2018-02-12 22:03:55
Thanks for the extensive reply. Just to check if I got it right: so basically, they would let the user enter some private information in the software (name, address etc) plus some password or an information only the user can know. Then the software would produce a hash of that information and put that hash on the (bitcoin) blockchain.  
In order to verify themselves to some third party, the user is asked to reproduce the hash by entering his private information + password into the app (it stays invisible to the third party) and if the hash is the same as in the blockchain, the verification is successful. In that way, the third party doesn't need to know the actual data (address etc), only that the user in question is indeed someone that he pretends to be.  
Did I get it right?

Not dumb at all. The chain is around 170gb, but if it is fully indexed, it is around 212gb, I think. If you set it up on a raspberry pi, prepare for a bit of tinkering. The windows/macos versions are pretty straightforward.  
I personally used this guide for raspberry pi, which includes a lightning node, but it's still testnet, although the switch to mainnet should be pretty simple.  
Again, on windows/macos it's much easier than the linked guide, so don't be discouraged :)

Well, no one really knows. A few years ago people thought $1k for a bitcoin was insane. Two years ago some people thought $18k was a fair price. No one really knows what will happen some years down the road (or not even a few weeks from now), although bitcoiners are of course generally quite optimistic on a long time scale.     


Only as much as you can imagine to lose without being hurt financially (or emotionally). You can get something like $20 bucks worth just to learn how to properly secure it and safely transact it, before buying any larger amounts.  
And for the love of god, don't buy altcoins. There's a reason why they are so "cheap". And no, none of them will be "the next bitcoin" or "bitcoin 2.0" or something like that.

According to Trezor and Ledger, no xpubs are being shared through their software. I think it is reasonable to believe this since their software is open sourced, but I haven't checked myself (nor do I have capabilities to check on my own).  
What their clients do though is to ask for balances on single addresses of your wallet, which then can be linked together at Trezor's/Ledger's backend, thus creating a cluster of all your bitcoin addresses and tracking all your coin movements (not saying they do that, but it's definitely possible for them and it's safer to assume they do).  
I don't know if they are able to track the IP you are connected from (or other sensitive information like your PC info, times you are connecting at, frequency of connections and so on), too.  
Edit: I just realized you mentioned that you use Ledger over Electrum. This means, Ledger cannot track your addresses, but the random Electrum Server you are connected to still can. There are all reasons to assume that chain analytics companies (Chainalysis, Elliptic etc) run multiple Electrum servers, so it's not much better than using Ledger software (although at least random Electrum servers don't know your name + home address as Ledger does, if you ordered through them directly).

"what is bitcoin" is a though question when there is a contentious split, as it is not as simple as just hash power majority. We'll have to include full nodes, users, wallets, exchanges, merchants etc into the picture, and that's where it gets messy, because it's not a simple mathematical fact anymore.  
At the moment, bitcoin for me is what my node decides to be the valid chain, by validating all the blocks and transactions on their own. Because I run my own node, I'm "safe".

I'm not sure how all the lightning wallets are managing that. Do they let the wallet user be an own lightning node, connecting to the wallet's own bitcoin full node? Or is the wallet user not a lightning node but has to connect/trust to one in order to use the wallet? A bit unclear here for me.

It can in theory, but it requires an entity with authoritative powers to define such a checkpoint, and it's unlikely that such entity will exist (users have all the incentives to be against such entities, as this would diminish bitcoin's decentralization and weaken one of its most important value propositions).  
Nevertheless, by default Bitcoin Core software comes with "assumevalid" feature. This means that it doesn't verify signatures until some defined block (saving time on initial syncing). Note that this is different from a checkpoint: with assumevalid, your node can still re-org to a longer valid chain, while a checkpoint is less flexible (it prevents re-orgs). Also note, that you are free to **not** use the assumevalid default and run your node without it (making it verify all the signatures from scratch).

You have to choose your info sources more carefully. There is purely technical discussion on the [developer mailing list]( or on  you can curate your input on Twitter, you can find/create Telegram/Discord/Slack/Gitter channels, also full with technical discussions etc etc.

"Inconclusive"? No one in the "early bitcoin community" has been even slightly positive (as far as I'm aware) that any of the claims of the new faketoshi could be true. Also, from your own article:

So how is that "inconclusive"? This is a very clear case of an impostor, unable to verify his claims with very simple actions.

Good thoughts, thanks for sharing :)
As you wrote in the beginning, the fees structure is a bit too complex to understand for the mainstream public, it seems. Alone the fact that you are paying per byte and not per amount of btc transferred is very counterintuitive and then to ask to check for the current mempool and fees is too much to ask for the average Joe...   
Interesting idea with third party.. although it probably will not be liked by many "old-school" bitcoiners :)

To get more precise: your time (f.ex surveys, referral programs), your privacy (potentially anything you participate in, esp. KYC compliant exchanges such as Coinbase and any other) or you taking on risk (no risk = no interest) is the product. There is never a free lunch.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:24:32
Well, an exchange or a service provider can refuse your deposit/payment. F.ex, exchanges don't typically allow withdrawals to third parties. Of course, they can't prove if the wallet you are withdrawing to belongs to you or a buddy of yours, but if you try to withdraw a public address of a gambling site f.ex, they might block your withdrawal.  
But that's what you get if you let third parties hold your funds. No one can block your transaction if you make it from a wallet of which you control your private keys.

This is not a problem for bitcoin itself, it's a problem for people who lost their keys or heirs who cannot access their deceased relatives coins etc.  
The more valuable bitcoin becomes, the more attention people will pay to proper storage, inheritance mechanisms and so on. And with time, education about storage will improve, as well as better technical solutions (see f.ex hardware wallets, which didn't exist five years ago or so in that retail-accessible format).  
So there is no systemic risk here, only personal (which I think will lessen over time, imo).

Before you transfer your funds to a hardware wallet, send first a small amount and then try to back up the wallet and re-install it with the recovery phrase.

I'm not sure what you mean by client support in this context, none of the older bitcoin clients is "supported" or "not supported", they're all backwards compatible (with some exceptions of very old clients, but afaik they can be made compatible with more current clients by small tweakings).  
But yes, if an older client turns out to have a critical bug, you'd be "forced" to update. "Forced" in quotes, because literally no one forces you to do anything. It's all voluntarily.  
Work on the code is also voluntarily. You are asking voluntary contributors to maintain a feature that they don't see as useful (and there are usually long, public debates about every change of the code), basically to do work for you for free.

I wonder, staying on the SW2X cannot be nash equilibrium at all then, except if that chain for some freaky reason is valued at a higher price than bitcoin? Otherwise, it's either optimal strategy to just stay on the bitcoin original chain or deviate from the NYA agreement quite quickly. Don't know how miners want to fulfil this non-binding (?) agreement when they risk getting out of business by honouring it. This all assuming the original chain being valued higher in price, which seems to be the case on bitfinex right now.

As far as my understanding goes, you can only have one seed phrase for each address. So either it displayed the old seed for the same address, or you created a new address with a new correlating seed phrase.  
But anyway, if you move your coins to a new wallet, and you don't intend to use the old wallet (or the old address in this wallet) ever again, you don't have to worry. Just be sure to have a good back up of the seed phrase on your new wallet :)

- don't touch other cryptos, except if you're in for a gamble  
- dollar cost avg reduces volatility but also the expected value. Depends what you prefer (higher variance + higher return or "smooth sailing" with lesser profits). Most people are probably better off with averaging in.  I would argue it doesn't really matter if you hold for 5+ years anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:53:40
Usually, when you click "receive" in your wallet, it gives you an address. When you made a transaction on that address, and then click "receive" again, it should show a new address. I'm not sure how MEW does that, but every wallet I've used so far showed a new receiving address, after the old one has been used.

Mostly for privacy reasons: you make it very easy for outside observers to see your balance (especially when you combine this balance with other addresses/UTXOs of yours, thus revealing your other balances).  
There are also some concerns about reusing addresses when it comes to cracking private keys with quantum computers, but since (at this point in time) quantum computing does not seem like it is going to be relevant for bitcoin any time soon, the privacy thing is a much more realistic threat.

While true in vacuum, this is not the most important goal overall. You could achieve this by increasing the throughput (bigger blocksize, f.ex), but this would externalize the costs pressure on node maintainers (storage costs, bandwidth costs, verification costs, initial blockchain download costs and so on). Higher costs (not only monetary) = more difficult to run a node. More difficult to run a node = less people use their own node. Less people use their own node = network gets less decentralized, less open, less censorship resistant, requires more trust being put in into the "big players" (wallets, block explorers, miners etc).  
So it's a little more complicated than "low median fees = good". ;)

Quoting this, as this is a very crucial point. There is a huge likelihood that there are things that are wrong in the draft, or at least can be improved in phrasing, definitions etc. That's totally ok, everyone starts off as a beginner, but you'll gain immensely in understanding when you allow for reviews and accept feedback from others. This also will improve the quality of your writing by a lot.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:45:33
You seem to conflate/misunderstand multiple different things. They are subtle and not intuitively easy to grasp, so be patient with yourself (and us) :)  


Running a node by itself is not some sort of a magic shield that protects from attacks. But: by using(!) your own full node you withdraw trust from third parties (miners, blockexplorers, your wallet's nodes) and put this trust into your own hardware, in your home, running software **you** chose to run. This means, those third parties cannot cheat/defraud you.  
To enable average user to run a full node, it needs to be affordable and not require expensive hardware + good bandwidth etc.  
The more people use their own nodes, the "healthier" the network is (because miners, your wallet's nodes etc) have less trust put into them, meaning they have less power). But: just spinning up a node doesn't contribute to the health of the network at all. A user needs to connect their wallet to the node and use it. If only a tiny minority of users use their own nodes, the majority implicitly has to trust third parties (miners etc) to play by the rules.  
Now, to your questions:  


You don't need technical knowledge to confirm if a transaction is valid: that's what your node is there for (although you of course do need some tinkering to set it up initially).  


I'm not sure what this means tbh? What does it matter on which layer an economic activity happens? Are you concerned about the fees on the base layer?
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:27:39
I'd say it's profitable for merchants to accept the risk of being "scammed" on a $5--$10 transaction than not taking 0 confirmations tx at all. Most people wouldn't bother to "scam" anyway, so this is an acceptable risk.

I don't think their user base is one that splashes with funds... It's neither whale money there, nor institutional. Besides, since you can't withdraw bitcoin from their app, it's not even attractive for people who actually want to 'have' bitcoin. And the average user who doesn't know what bitcoin ist, but just wants to speculate on the price, will perhaps get some $100's worth, but even if that's like 500k people, it's just a tiny blip in the daily btc volume.

Does the string of numbers and letters start with a `1`, a `3` or `bc1q`? If yes, it's just an address which anyone can use to send bitcoin to that person. It's disposable and probably not much of value at all to that person (he can recreate that address or just create a new one).

I haven't thought about it deeply and it is not my area of expertise at all.  
You make a reasonable point. I think the (theoretical) danger is that for bitcoin addresses to become quantum resistant, either all(!) funds will need to move to a new address format, which is impossible, given how many private keys are lost (f.ex Satoshi's coins). Or there will need to be some sort of a hardfork, which can become a  very messy situation as well.  
But in any case, we are talking about a purely speculative scenario at this point (as far as my understanding of quantum computing goes, which is not that far).

I absolutely agree with you. Still, it makes a huge difference for the headline's perception to leave out a fact like this.  
It would be like a mainstream media outlet (theoretical example) writing "US government  shuts down bitcoin's mining", when in reality US government shut down one particular mining operator for whatever reason. Still very bad and news worthy, but very different headline, imo.

"Escalating on-chain fees" is what will let bitcoin survive over long-term (when block subsidy disappears). No one cares about fork wars (and the average user doesn't know of them in the first place, imo).  
That said, I actually don't think mainstream adoption will happen any time soon, nor do I think it's really that important. Bitcoin will do what it does without mass adoption. But perhaps it's an unpopular opinion, I don't know :)
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:38:01
Whichever way you decide to proceed, I recommend you to learn about coincontrol (and use a wallet that allows for it, like Bitcoin Core, Wasabi or Electrum).  
The concept is not that difficult actually, just a best practice for better privacy. Coincontrol means choosing which UTXOs (= coins) you want to pick when sending a transaction (by default the wallet chooses them automatically). This means, you can choose UTXOs which have been associated with your real name for non-sensitive purposes, and you can choose UTXOs which are not associated with your name for more sensitive purposes (the VPN thing, f.ex).  
I think this is also treated in the Wasabi FAQ, which you probably found by yourself by now :) but also more in depth here: 
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:53:22
"Privacy" is not a binary state, it has all kinds of shades of grey and forms. It also depends whom you want protect your privacy against (your credit card company? Your coworkers? Chain analysis companies? etc).  
To achieve "full privacy" (whatever it means) is very difficult, especially for a beginner. You will be leaking some information at some point. And you will need to put a lot of thought and reading time in order to understand what you are doing.  


Those are two are ok. But: just by using them you don't automatically have full privacy. You have to understand (at some surface level at least) what they are doing and how to use them right. Also keep in mind that even if used right, they don't guarantee full protection against very sophisticated actors (but chances are high you don't need that high level of protection).  
You need to start learning, f.ex here:  or here:  The [Wasabi FAQ]( is also a good place.  


It depends, but for the most part: any exchange that lets you deposit fiat will know your information, yes. The credit card company/bank will also know that you deposited on a bitcoin exchange (nothing wrong with that in the first place, but yes, your anonymity is gone against those, at least).  


Cash in person, or p2p exchanges like HodlHodl or Bisq, or a bitcoin ATM.  
In general, you will need to pick two of three: private - convenient - cheap. Private and convenient will not be cheap, cheap and convenient won't be private and so on.
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:24:09


Not quite. Only in case where there has been a temporarily split in the chain, caused by a block simultaneously found by two different miners. Then the cumulative difficulty is the metric on which the network decides which chain is "correct".  
In case of a permanent split (when someone forks themselves off from the bitcoin network, like BCH did), the cumulative difficulty is less relevant. If, f.ex, BCH would gain a majority of hash power, it still would be BCH, not bitcoin.

Your question attracts flippant answers and trolling because a) this gets asked a lot (just try to type "whale manipulation" and similar terms into the search), b) implies a certain misunderstanding how markets work and c) implies a certain misunderstanding how bitcoin adoption happens.  
There are a few good articles addressing bitcoin's volatility, f.ex this one:   
or this one:   
In short, bitcoin's volatility is mainly caused by a highly illiquid market (where "whales" can have an impact on the short-term price movements). This is "good for bitcoin", because it contributes to adoption (people getting in because they want to get rich, but stay because they are "forced" to learn about the tech in order to survive). It also will smooth down over time, as more money flows into the market, making it more liquid and less prone to impacts of large orders.  
I also invite you to remember, that ten years ago the whole tradable bitcoin market was only a handful of people: Satoshi, Hal Finney and a few other OG's. Now it's millions of people. And it grows each year.  
A "whale" won't stay a whale for long if he splashes around with bitcoin.

Is the point being that it has no inherent value (or pegged to anything)? If so, I agree :)  
My assumption (based on hope :D) is that it will reach a some kind of equilibrium in price where it doesn't fluctuate as wildly as we see right now and can make a step further to being a medium of exchange and unit of account.    
Doesn't the question of inherent value apply to any kind of currency though?

This.. is not how price discovery works. If you try to estimate the value of your house by valuing it purely in bitcoin terms, without looking at the fiat/btc price*, you deprive yourself of a very crucial piece of information, thus making a catastrophic mispricing very likely.  
\* or at least researching the market what bitcoin value other, similar houses in your area would have (which, again, implies a look at $ valuation).  
By all means, do take bitcoin for whatever goods or services you are selling, I think this is fantastic.. But the $ value still has to play a role in estimating the fair price.. (for now).

There are currently around 60-70k nodes on the network, all over the planet. And at the moment, new blocks propagate between them within a split of a second or few seconds max (I don't know tbh how fast, but very fast).  
This won't be possible with 10mb blocks.  


I guess I am a "geek with a bitcoin node" and I have no optical fiber and really shitty bandwidth. If we only let people with good resources (hardware, bandwidth) participate on bitcoin's network - why not just go all the way and use the current, permissioned fiat system, where only a few large players decide on the rules? Because that's where we would be heading if we make it expensive and burdensome to run nodes for verification.

This is managed automatically by your wallet. You just need to enter the amount you want to send, the wallet then automatically picks one of your addresses (UTXOs) it wants to send **from** and creates a new address to receive the change.  
Some wallets (Wasabi, Electrum) offer slightly more advanced features: they let you choose which UTXO you want to send funds from (this is called "coincontrol" and allows for better privacy, if done right).  
There are also wallets that are far more advanced and let you construct a transaction manually (including entering change addresses yourself) but this is quite difficult and not recommended, except if you really know what you are doing and/or for educational purposes (to learn how tx's work on a deeper level, f.ex).
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:04:52
Bad analogy. Imagine whoever owns the keys can transfer the house to a new location, only known and accessible to the key owner, and then you'd be closer to the truth.
@_date: 2018-07-09 06:13:49
No, you can have a practically infinite amount of receiving addresses generated from the private key (that's what the wallet does "in the background").  
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how this works in detail, but generally I think it's that you have a "master" private key, from which you can generate new public keys, which then have corresponding recieving addresses (which again, is what the wallet manages automatically).  
There are some more technical infos here: 
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:22:25

"Consensus" is a somewhat vague term in this context, but in any case: it's only regarding changes of the Bitcoin protocol itself. All the infrastructure space (to which BitPay and other companies belong) has nothing to do with the protocol directly and doesn't involve consensus for changes (at least the way Andreas means it).  
What you can do is simply not use BitPay services and let your merchants know about alternatives (Btcpayserver).

Check out this guide, it has basically everything what you ask (on a Raspberry Pi), esp. the bonus sections:   
You'll definitely need some tinkering and patience, but don't worry: it's all manageable. The guide above is mostly copypasting commands. Unfortunately, at this moment in time, this is needed until more user-friendly solutions come on the market. And imo it's worth it, as you'll have much better privacy (compared to simply using your hardware wallet's software) and a higher degree of sovereignty (independent of blockexplorers and hardware wallet's software etc).

So what's the difference to previously being a bitcoin wallet in a nutshell?
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:49:18
For the same reason as for on-chain transactions: you can't make bitcoins out of nothing (=you cannot construct invalid transactions). If you have 1 bitcoin, the highest amount you can send is 1 bitcoin. Otherwise the transaction is simply invalid and will not be accepted by validating nodes.  
LN transactions are signed bitcoin transactions. You cannot fund a channel with an invalid transaction. Hence, no fractional reserve (or comparable cheating is possible).  
Meanwhile, fractional reserve banking means that by having 1 dollar, the bank can loan out 10 dollars to other people.

The same as you uninstall any other software from mac.  
The bitcoin blockchain is what takes up the vast majority of the HD space (around 200gb), at least if it's unpruned, so it might be an option to use an external hard drive, or dedicated hardware, or make sure to free up some space on your mac to sync the blockchain (and transfer it to the external harddrive afterwards)

That's the tricky part that can become very very messy if there's contention. But f.ex nodes can signal for a specific BIP by modifying their nodes version name, miners can signal as well with their software/their blocks, there's social media, polls and so on.  
But yeah, everything of those can be gamed and is also not binding at all (one can signal as much as they like and still not go through with the hard fork, like we saw with 85% of miners signaling for Segwit2x and not going through with it in the end).  
Contentious hardforks are avoided for this reason (plus a few others). Again, when in doubt, the safest thing to do is to do nothing (and continue to use your own node).  
edit: as u/maxcoiner mentioned, there's also a possibility of a futures market to find out how the market prices different fork versions, which is probably the least gameable option of all (because it costs money to game it). This isn't a consensus measurement mechanism directly though, but still an interesting way to find out which version is worth more in the eyes of market participants.

The USB (2.0) or something on my external HDD  seems to be the bottleneck for certain. I have tried different configurations and different OS (Mac and Windows), and wasn't able to get it to an acceptable speed (it would take me weeks and weeks).
I managed to free up some space on my internal SSD temporarily and there it was much more speedily (I managed to get it to 90% progress by running it over few nights on my laptop... Unfortunately, I only can use it overnight and move lots of files in order to do this on my laptop).
I really hope it's not the same issue with the Pi, but given that you're able to run mainnet+lightning w/o issues gives me hope :)  
Perhaps USB 3.0 makes all the difference? Or my old external HDD (my HDD for the Pi is a newer one, ordered it just for the Pi) is slowing things down this much...  
But either way, I'm almost there with mainnet sync, yay! :)
@_date: 2018-07-01 09:08:04


Not "steal", but doublespend (which can be used for effectively stealing though). It works only for your own transactions though. F.ex., you buy something with your bitcoin, receive whatever you bought, and then (with &gt;50% of hashing power) you publish a new, "alternative" version of the blockchain where this bitcoin transaction didn't happen and you still have the bitcoin under your control.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:48:52






@_date: 2019-09-20 10:30:55
Well, that depends what "little bit of privacy" means to you :)  
I guess the easiest way to achieve that is to simply not using KYC services (the ones that ask you for ID, address proof etc) when buying bitcoin. And use a non-custodial wallet (a hardware wallet, if possible). Then just continue to educate yourself as you go and build up your knowledge. You don't have to understand everything at once, be gentle with yourself ;) But also continue to ask if something's unclear.

For those who don't know what PoWx is - it's a company/organisation proposing proof of work change, which is obviously a very contentious topic. I'm highly sceptical of their proposal, but I'm curious about the interview.

That's true, but overpaying entities are making it more expensive for all participants in the network: f.ex if the highest fees right now on the blockchain are, say, 20sat/b, but then someone like Coinbase comes along and fires out tons of transactions with 100sat/b, now the people who want priority confirmations have to pay over 100sat/b and then the competition upwards starts. But the opposite is also true: when everyone tries to be efficient with the fees, everyone benefits.

Not entirely sure what a "pre-build crypto management solution" is (not familiar with the examples you gave, unfortunately). Do you want to accept bitcoin, or do you want to have a payment processor convert it into fiat?  
If the former, you might want to look at 
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:50:37
Important nuance, yes. Not debatable :)  
Mining hashpower alone doesn't get to define what is bitcoin. It gets to decide which chain is the valid one **within** the valid rules of the bitcoin system, in case of a temporary disagreement (such a two simultaneously produced blocks).  Not if the rules have been changed in a backwards non-compatible way.

This doesn't say anything how "most users" use LN though? I mean, if I load up a node + multiple channels with 20 BTC, I'd be the biggest node on the network, but still that wouldn't mean anything for the usage statistics that we are interested in this case?

You actually kinda can, it's just not profitable, scalable or easy at all. In 1980 a man named Glenn Seaborg managed to transmute "several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold. [...] His experimental technique, using nuclear physics, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms": 
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:22:27
Not sure what you mean exactly?  
In any case, the SPV model has been widely criticized, as it kinda sits in the middle between "convenience" &lt;-&gt; "trustless validation/privacy" trade offs, without actually giving the full benefits of the latter, and introducing further attack vectors (it still has to trust miners not to misbehave in various ways, f.ex).  
Edit: I guess you mean the point of using your own node for verifying your transactions? Since SPV is mostly used in wallets (not as a standalone node), it doesn't really apply here: if you use SPV model, it's most likely **is** your wallet. While with a full node, your wallet (Ledger, Electrum, Trezor, or whatever you use) needs to be connected to the node (except if you use the already integrated Bitcoin Core wallet functionality).  
I hope that's not too convoluted of an explanation :) Let me know if you want it to have explained better (I know it was confusing for me when I was digging into all that).

If you can "brute force" the private key, you don't need to tinker with block hashes though, or introduce "shorter proof of work blockchains"... (I don't mean to imply that QC is a realistic threat, just saying that in theory they don't need to introduce alternative blockchain versions, if they "simply" can brute force the private key)

Just FYI, the three most popular/developed lightning network implementations (LND, c-lightning, Eclair) are all in beta phase now officially (although c-lightning and Eclair have only entered it very recently... LND has been in beta since a couple of months now).  
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:00:28
You indicated that it is from Lightning Labs, so I assume it's an LND wallet and their seed is not compatible with Electrum, that's why it thinks it's a new wallet without balance. I don't think there's another wallet where you can import the seed, unfortunately.  
It might be some issue that the LND wallet is not syncing correctly for some reason and doesn't display the right balance (yet)?

@_date: 2018-07-08 19:04:54
BCH has already more blocks (longer chain), because miners exploited their diff. adjustment algorithm for a period of time. So if 80% of miners switched to BCH right now, it would become bitcoin somehow by your logic? :)
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:11:43


in vacuum, perhaps. In the "real world" I think losing half of all hashpower overnight will shake the markets quite strongly and have a depreciating effect on the price (at least in short term). It also depends why and how the hashrate disappears, of course.  
In any case, I think the equation `lower hashrate = higher price` is a little too simplistic (it assumes that demand will stay exactly the same, which I very much doubt in case of such disruptive events).
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:41:40


nothing at all, afaik there are some (be careful, there's a very high likelihood to encounter a scams/malware). But it's unrealistic to guess the right words AND the order to find a particular private key. It's basically like throwing darts into the universe to find a very particular atom.   
You write that you have 10 words. This is odd, as usually wallets give 12 or 24 words as backup. So perhaps you just miss two words? In that case (and if you have the other 10 words in the right order) it might be actually possible to brute force the lacking two words.

Not an expert in mining, so take it with a grain of salt.  
Afaik, most pools use the [Stratum mining protocol]( (and probably some own GUI on top to interface with it/with their pool). The problem with that is that it gives the pool operator a lot of power about which transactions to mine, or even which chain to mine. So essentially, power to misbehave. I don't think we ever encountered a mining pool operator misbehaving in this context, but it's still a danger.  
There's a proposal by Matt Corallo, called [BetterHash]( which gives the individual miners more power (taking it away from the pool operator). But it hasn't been widely implemented in the pools yet.

@_date: 2018-07-08 18:35:53


The length (nor the difficulty) doesn't actually matter in this case. If 90% of miners would get together, introduce some non-backwards compatible change to the protocol and create a longer chain, they would simply fork themselves off the network (if they don't have agreement of the nodes and the rest of the users).  
The length of the chain is only important if there's a block found simultaneously by two different miners, so it's a temporary split.. Then the longer chain is decisive, on which of those blocks to continue. This happens basically every day in bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-09-01 22:55:00
Your plan sounds alright as far as I can see, and kudos for bothering to actually set up your own node.  


A mixer is commonly used to unlink your identity from a particular UTXO (transaction). Since you plan to buy at an ATM, where you typically don't need to present your ID and other KYC details, sending the coins through a mixer seems unnecessary, but you also could take it as a good opportunity to learn how Wasabi wallet (and CoinJoin in general) works.  
Not to discourage you from looking deeper into running your own node and so on, but if really all you want to do is a single one-off transaction, you might simply use Wasabi wallet (it runs on Tor by default). But if you want to keep using bitcoin, then yeah, your own node is advisable for better privacy and minimizing trust to any third party.  


You essentially need your node only when you check your transactions (or want to send one). But if you have been offline for a while, it can take some time for the node to sync back up. The longer it was offline, the more time it needs.  
Edit: forgot to mention - Wasabi requires 0.1 btc to join a mixing round, so keep that in mind if you plan to use it!
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:17:38


Good question.  
You know this by running a full node (short for "fully verifying node"). It's a software that verifies all the transactions that ever happened on the bitcoin's network (starting from the very first block, called "genesis block") and ensures that those transactions are properly signed (with cryptographic signatures), haven't been doublespent and so on. Those nodes also check the total supply by verifying the blocks created by the miners, which create new bitcoin. Should a block include more newly created bitcoin than allowed, it will get rejected by all the nodes on the network.  
In short: you know for sure when you run (and use) your own full node.  


Bitcoin has no inherent value (like any other object in the universe, but we can get into a long philosophical debates here). But it has valuable properties such as being permissionless, scarce, very easily transferrable, highly divisible, open source, verifiable, borderless and censorship resistant.  
To be honest, it's really difficult to say what these properties are worth, that's one of the reasons why bitcoin's price is so volatile right now. It will get less volatile as people continue to learn and understand it better and can price it more accurately.

Tbh, I'm also not sure which venue might be appropriate for such type of input. It might be not technical enough/too vague for the lightning-dev mailing list and too extensive for LND Slack channel or Twitter.  
I guess what I would do is to write down these thoughts as clear and concise as I could on Medium, and then share the link(s) in LND Slack/Twitter to have people with more knowledge look at them in hopes of a fruitful discourse or at least raising awareness for the issues that you mention.  
The trick is to not make it seem like subtle FUD, because there are already a few of those out there and for the avg reader it's really tough to distinguish because of the level of complexities involved. Even a more technical reader is in danger to dismiss a "wall of text" if it looks like FUD at the first glance.  
Anyway, I'd like to encourage you to share more input, and to join the LND Slack (though it's rather a chat format) and perhaps put together some articles on Medium for easier referencing and, hopefully, for a better discourse. :)  
P.S.: Link to the LND slack invite (very bottom of the page):   
It seems that the majority of the LN devs and many users are hanging out there :)

- although the last satoshi being mined is still something like 140y away in the future, the miners incentive to mine will need to be carried by fees already after the next 2-3 halvings (so after 5-9 years). So the price of bitcoin and/or adoption need to increase quite a lot in order to make up for the halvings. I'm positive that this won't be an issue, but it's an unknown variable nevertheless.  
- it's quite difficult to use bitcoin with a high degree of privacy. An average (uneducated) user will leak information on every corner (not running their own node, use blockexplorers, use KYC services, not practicing coincontrol/coinjoin etc).  
- if bitcoin's price rises dramatically, the fees denominated in $ will rise appropriately, even if fees in sat/byte stay the same (or even decrease slightly). This will disincentivize smaller transactions, so hopefully by that time off-chain solutions such as the Lightning network and others will gain more traction and be even easier to use.

There are some reasons: development power, hashing power, network effects, user number, the most tested chain against time and  different kind of attacks, most decentralised chain. 
Obviously, all those are not guarantees.. No one can predict the future and there is &gt;0% chance of bitcoin being overtaken by another currency or failing for some reasons altogether (Matt Corallo, one of the core devs, estimates the chances of bitcoin to "succeed" at 5%.. however his definition of success is).

I'm not aware of such stats (how most users operate). Do you mean that most LN users don't run their own nodes? At the moment it seems to me it's the other way around, but it's just my general perception, not backed by stats.

Great advice. Except don't do paper wallets OP, except if you just want to experiment a little with transacting bitcoin or holding very low amounts.  
Get either a hardware wallet (such as Trezor or Ledger) for larger amounts/long-term storage, or a phone/desktop wallet for lower amounts/funds for short-term spending. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:43:25


Electrum + EPS seems like the default setup in such scenarios. Electrum is the go-to advanced wallet because it is compatible with most hardware wallets (and different seed formats, multisig setups etc), plus it has advanced features such as coincontrol, message signing and so on. It also is one (if not **the**) most popular open source wallets, so it has a lot of eyes watching over the code, fixing bugs etc.  
But it has to connect to an Electrum server, which you can run with ElectrumX or Electrum Personal Server (the latter requires less resources afaik, that's why it is used for raspberry pi's).  
Afaik, Coldcard hasn't even their own wallet software (to avoid different attack vectors), so it needs a third party wallet such as Electrum (but you can use any other compatible one, too).  


Yes, you run EPS on the raspberry pi node and connect to it with Electrum from your desktop/laptop.  


Haven't checked recently. I paid around $50 for the Raspberry hardware (incl keyboard) and $100 for the HDD. This was roughly two years ago or so.
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:19:48
Your node is probably still syncing up or (re-)indexing the blocks. Nothing to worry about, it's normal. Just might take some (or a lot of) time.  
If you're syncing up everything from scratch on the node itself, it potentially can take weeks though. Usually the initial sync is done on a "regular" computer and transferred to the HDD of the raspberry.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:20:04

There's no "the risk". There's risk you can take on according to your personal (financial) circumstances, your personal risk acceptance (mentally/financially), your understanding of proper bitcoin storage and some other factors.  
If you have money that you can afford to lose and which you won't need within the next few years: sure, why not dabble with bitcoin and learn about it as you go. Getting a small amount is a good incentive to learn about storage and other important things.  
I strongly suggest educating yourself first though. You can start with the side bar in this sub (or "about" section, if you're on mobile), and browse through some articles here:

Hi Jamie. If bitcoin is a fraud, why do you sell it to your customers through your company?
@_date: 2019-09-27 10:39:50
This is impossible to answer in any serious way without knowing your situation. The default answer: if you have to ask, you most likely shouldn't.  
The detailed answer is: it depends on your financial situation (debt? income? financial plans/goals? will you need money you plan to put into bitcoin within the next 3-5 years? will you be financially/emotionally able to stomach a full loss of your investment?), as well as how well you understand the basics of bitcoin storage and why you want to get some in the first place.

Hey, cause I see your nick again: a few months ago you have been raising some very technical questions regarding LN (esp on privacy and routing) that were too complex for me and looked interesting, but didn't get much discussion going on here.

You are right about his connections (it's not a secret he's affiliated with bitcoin,com), but tbh I found the article quite neutral. I also watched the interactions on the LND slack (Andreas with devs and other users), and I really couldn't interpret anything as a malicious intent, rather as a desire to learn and to set up things.  
There's no shame in describing steps how to set up everything from scratch, and he doesn't complain how complex it all is, or makes other interpretative assumptions/conclusions, so I'm fine with the article, even as LN fanboy.

You are speaking of "two sides coming together in a mutual agreement". Which two sides are these? No one asked the users or the developers about their opinion (perhaps because it was clear that they wouldn't agree?). That's why there is an uproar about that "mutual agreement" - the group in question represents only one of the constituents of the overall bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:03:14


I doubt it really trades (apart from some faked volume). If the last price was $1 (or whatever it was) and after that no one is trading it, the price stays at $1. It simply is a side effect of a dead market (and also why marketcap statistics are largely a silly metric). Nothing ever really goes to 0 on paper.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:50:05
If there is no consensus, you simply don't do anything and you'll automatically be on the "correct" chain. Because when there's no consensus, status quo prevails and all attack attempts (or attempts to change the protocol rules) end up on the "wrong" chain.  
This is simplifying technical subtleties somewhat, but the basic rule is: in case of doubt do nothing and you'll be fine (at least if you use your own node).

@_date: 2019-09-24 09:40:23


Nitpick: simply adding unused nodes doesn't do much for the network. Getting more people to **use** their nodes is what matters.  
F.ex, if you spin up a node and let it sit there, while continuing to use your wallet's default node doesn't give neither you nor the network any benefits. In order for a node to be useful to you, you need to connect your wallet to it*.  
\* but of course it's also fine to have a fully synced but unused node, who knows if you might need one later in the future, and syncing does take quite a while (depending on the hardware/internet connection)

@_date: 2019-09-23 17:23:49


I don't think this is correct. Nothing is being pushed, you are free to maintain an older version (or a software fork with the compatible changes).  
For exactly this reason there is no push update mechanism, so you have to install a new version manually - if you want to install it in the first place.

If you buy bitcoin without showing anyone your ID/name/face, and then don't mix those inputs with other inputs that are linked to your identity, you're pretty private, I would say.
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:48:07


Not quite: you can "do the PoW" without running a node (which is a bit dangerous though). F.ex. people contributing the mining power to a pool (which I guess is what most miners do) don't run a node on their end. The pool operator does though (hopefully).

It really depends on the curiosity level of the listener, their background (technical/non-technical?) and their time/attention span.  
A version of this might work as an ELI5:  
Every bitcoin address has a correlating "secret" (private key, something like a very long password). In order to spend from a bitcoin address, you need to know the "secret" correlating to that address. Typically, your wallet creates this secret/private key randomly and then derives bitcoin addresses from it. The holder of that private key can spend whatever funds end up on those addresses (and so can anyone else that gets hold of that private key).  
With cryptography/math, it's possible to prove to the world that you know this secret/private key without actually revealing it.  
Not sure if it's actually helpful or not for someone who never heard of bitcoin, public/private keys and so on?

it depends if it will become possible for quantum computers to perform meaningful tasks, which is debatable (and it won't happen all of a sudden, if it's possible at all). We don't know ultimately though, but there are much more realistic dangers to the network and users, so it's not a priority anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:56:56
1) go to  and look up (beginner) information on bitcoin. Come back here to ask questions if something is unclear. There is a lot to learn but also many people to help you out, in case you feel stuck. Consider posting questions to r/bitcoinbeginners if you feel you have difficulties grasping something basic (don't worry, we all started from zero).  
2) when you understood how to set up a wallet and how to back it up safely, you can put up a bitcoin address on your page and let people know you accept bitcoin for donations.  
edit: please don't ask for donations here directly (it's not allowed by this sub's rules, and for a very good reason). 
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:37:15
Kinda, but this doesn't have to do anything with 51% of users being able to change protocol rules. But sure, they could go ahead and create an altcoin, nobody can stop them. For this altcoin to become "bitcoin" the rest of the space has to come to consensus with that group though, which is basically impossible, since if there was consensus, the split wouldn't have happened in the first place (this is different for forks where is overwhelming consensus that the new version is bitcoin, due to bugs f.ex).  
The basic property of bitcoin's protocol: if there is no consensus on a protocol change, status quo remains. This means, if there is no consensus to take satoshis coins (there will never be, at least not for the foreseeable future), status quo remains, and no 51% of anything will be able to change that.

I guess you could do that, but first try to check if you perhaps misspelled a word or something. You might also want to try a different wallet such as Electrum, to see if it's something wrong with your Mycelium wallet (perhaps it cannot get a connection with the internet or something else).

Those are only listening nodes (port 8333 open). The number of non-listening nodes is much higher (~60-70k currently). There is no difference in their functionality for the node maintainer.  


How is this number derived and what's the attack scenario, if &gt;66% of nodes go down? Also, the structure of the quoted sentence doesn't make any sense :)

Just a small nitpick: Shapeshift is not non-custodial at all. At least their exchange isn't (I don't know if they have a wallet separately from the exchange). You have to fully trust them to pay out the funds to you when you send them.

OP says that in case of fork not happening, both BT1 and BT2 tokens should be either made worthless or refunded. I don't understand this logic. If I bet on BT1 (current chain) and no fork happens, how is it fair that my bet is nullified? No fork happening = current chain wins, BT2 (SW2X) coin looses. Why should the bet be nullified?  
edit: I guess one could argue that the BT1 token has much better odds to survive, since chances of fork not happening &gt;0%, but that should be priced in in it's price, hence no bias. Just price discovery.

I'm just curious, where in the linked article did you read about voting? I searched for `vote` and `voting` but didn't get any results.  
There is no "voting" in bitcoin like in a democratical system. Bitcoin is not democratic at all, rather anarchic.

you can use commands like `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo` (to see if you have connections to your node) or `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo` (to see if your node is synced up with the rest of the network - check f.ex if the "blocks" number is the same as other blockexplorers show).  
You could monitor the .log file to see if everything is going as it should (probably with something like `sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log`).  
You also can go on  and enter your node's IP and see if it comes up (if it doesn't show, it doesn't necessarily mean that your node is not working as intended; it also can just mean your port 8333 is closed, which is nothing to worry about, at least if you're not running LN).

Every platform that touches fiat needs your KYC (Know Your Customer) details (ID scan etc).  
If you are privacy minded (which is a good thing), your options are buying on peer2peer exchanges like HodlHodl or Bisq, or bitcoin ATMs, or finding people offline (on bitcoin meetups etc) to trade. Or try to earn bitcoin by selling goods or services.
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:28:09
I can't answer these questions with a good conscience. Some feedback:  


One party controlling &gt;50% of mining power does not equal an attack. Is your question asking how likely it is to occur that one large mining entity controls &gt;50% of power, or is the question how likely they use it to attack the network?   


Here I would answer "rare" for bitcoin and give a much higher probability for ethereum.  


What does this even mean, "wrong data"? Invalid transactions? If so, you can't publish invalid transactions on blockchain, they get rejected by full nodes. I mean, you can broadcast them, but they won't be "written" into the blockchain.  


again, needs to differentiate between bitcoin and other chains (see ethereum DAO, where data has been rolled back)   
Generally, most of the questions I would answer very differently if there was a differentiation between bitcoin and ethereum, f.ex

Ehm, nobody forces you to  use their software. You can create your own version of bitcoin core with all the features you desire, or you simply can choose not to update from your previous version. Literally nobody is taking something away from you.  
You can run your node with any software you want, but if you don't like what is available "on the menu", you have to create it yourself, or contribute to its creation, or pay someone to create it for you.
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:45:39
It makes sense to run a node regardless of mining activity (mainly for higher privacy and for removing the need for trusted third parties when transacting on the bitcoin network).  
If you solo mine, you should run a node for the additional reason of protecting yourself from mining an invalid block (because you included an invalid tx, f.ex). If you mine in a pool, you probably trust the pool operator to run a node and not to feed your miner invalid tx's in the first place though.  
disclaimer: I am not very familiar with mining, so might misunderstand something here.
@_date: 2018-07-21 08:56:14
Are you aware that bitcoin's blocks have frequently been &gt;1mb, sometimes even &gt;2mb in the last six months?
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:26:37


It's safe to do so usually.. It just will continue where it stopped, after you turn it on again. By turning it off you just slow down the process a little (depending how long it stays turned off), but nothing "bad" should happen otherwise.  


the `sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log` (modify accordingly if your installation path is different) can give some indication what the status is (although it is can be quite confusing to read as it is mixed up with a bunch of other things usually).  
The `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo` shows a number called `verificationprogress`. The same command also can also give a hint if you compare the number of blocks it shows to the number in some blockexplorer such as blockstream.info.  
There might be some other commands, but I don't recall any right now.

There is no guarantee for that. Only your node can tell for sure if a particular transaction is valid or not. If it's valid, your node propagates it to other nodes, and if it's not valid, it doesn't get propagated.  
There is no list of all transactions "that are yet to be mined" somewhere (nor is it possible to have, because new transactions are being propagated constantly), so of course it's possible that someone somewhere sends out a transaction that is not valid. Chances are though, that it won't arrive anywhere, because no full node will propagate an incorrect transaction.

No.  
I can confirm that you don't need VPS for Electrum + EPS on raspberry pi, at least as long as you use both from your local home network. I don't know what the case is if you want to connect to your raspberry remotely from another network.  
 
I also don't know what the case is with Zap. Since for Lightning you need other nodes to connect and open channels with you, I assume it needs to be able to be connected to remotely, for which it needs a fixed IP (which you get with a VPS, but also with Tor).  


The issue is that Bitcoin Core doesn't have hardware wallet integration directly. It still is being worked on, and I think you actually can use it through command line already, as an experimental feature. But it's not yet possible to use it with GUI (graphic user interface) directly yet.

I'm not an expert and also perhaps I misunderstand your question, but "sync" is essentially "validation" mostly. If you don't validate the chain on your own, how do you know that it is the correct one (doesn't include doublespends, inflation, has the longest chain, most PoW etc)?  
Also, there is something like pruning (deleting the blocks after verifying them and keeping only the headers), and `assumevalid` (skipping signature verification until a specified block). Perhaps this is what you meant?

If I send you a signed, guaranteed valid transaction (guaranteed by your own node, no need to trust me), which simply needs to be broadcast, is it "truly" bitcoin or not?

Do not do paper wallets. They are much easier to screw up in multiple ways (both while set up and storage). See also this video:   
Get one single hardware wallet, like Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

It's too new to have a calculator. At the moment you might route a few transactions if you have liquid channels with inbound capacity. But you'll get 1 satoshi per routed transaction, and 1 satoshi is a very small fraction of one cent, so...

Well, don't forget that the quality of a reddit sub depends on what users post, which means that there's a lot of noise, but it also means that if you want to see more of a particular topic, YOU have to post it yourself :) And also make use of up-/downvoting and so on. Complaining about what other post is fruitless, you only can influence your own behaviour.  
And even more fruitful is to help generate those news you want to see yourself. F.ex you could explain [BTCPayserver]( to merchants, or help them set it up, or explain why you want them to accept bitcoin and so on. That's the property of an open source space: contribute if you want to see something done, otherwise chances are it won't be done at all.

There are no answers for your questions, because they depend on what kind of "upgrade" it will be (if it will become necessary at all, which is an open question at this point in time), and nobody has proposed anything concrete yet. Again, it is yet an open question if QC will ever be sufficiently advanced to break (bitcoin's) encryption.

The point of the quote you are citing is that incentives matter. The man who is depending on a salary has all the incentives not to question the entity who pays out the salary.  
The man who already has a fortune though, has all the incentives to be paranoid about his wealth and to watch out for threats to it. And bitcoiners are by nature quite adversarial thinkers (on average at least).  
What you are describing is more of a gambler's fallacy or investors bias (I think there's actually a better term for that), and your point is not entirely wrong in this context.  
In any case, the quantum computing threat does not exist for the foreseeable future and its questionable if it will ever become a real threat at all. Not an expert though.

The difference is that mining rewards, however small, are still "guaranteed" (even though there is an element of luck/randomness), while trying to crack (= guess) private keys of wallets will stay an unprofitable business for the foreseeable future, as far as we can tell with our current knowledge of physics + computer science.
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:13:28
That's the whole point of 2of3 or 3of5 or similar multisig schemes: you can lose *n* amount of keys and still be able to access your bitcoin.  
I would advise you not to put your money on a relatively advanced storage system like multisig, if you don't know what you are doing. Higher complexity = higher risk of loss.  
But by all means, don't be discouraged to learn about it!

1) Miners do not care about the value of your transaction. A $1 tx is exactly the same to them as a $100.000.000 tx, so I don't see your point re: "making anything less than a $100 transaction charity to miners"?  
2) if you paid "exorbitant fees" in the last few months, your wallet's fees estimation algorithms might be broken, or some exchange tried to rip you off charging too high network fees.  
3) to your actual question: the transaction fees are kinda correlated with BTC price in fiat. Say your transaction costs 50 sat, so obviously in fiat it would be cheaper today than it was in december 2017, wenn 50 sats were much higher in $ price.  
But generally, fees are directly depending on the number of transactions, that compete on being included in a block. The more competition -&gt; the higher the fees.

There is a huge drop in tx volume, as the linked chart suggests, from the peak of dec. 2017 to where we are now. But keep in mind, the chart is a bit misleading, since it doesn't incorporate batching (one transaction can have many outputs, but is still counted as one single tx).  
Basically, the drop in fees is explained by a comination of following reasons:  
- batching (see a great analysis here:  which many exchanges started using in the last few months    
- drop in transaction volume (as your chart suggests)  
- SegWit (allowing for lower fees), which found much broader adoption since Dec 2017, as seen here:

How are those numbers arrived at?  


The most used counter argument is that this encourages better investment allocations (when you are not "forced" to spend by inflation, you can make better choices, and price discovery is more efficient, since bad/risky investments are not "enforced" on retail customers etc). Which makes sense to me personally.  
Another argument is that you still buy a new phone when you need/want it, despite you **knowing** that 2-3 years later you'll get a much better phone for the same money.

Yeah I missed that point initially, sorry - see my edit.  
I don't think connecting to random Electrum servers is much better (although it mitigates some of the concerns with Ledger Live/Trezor). I'd definitely recommend you running a node yourself and setting up Tor + Electrum Personal Server on it, so you can connect Electrum (and your hardware wallet) directly to it and not to random stranger's servers ;)  
I setup mine with this guide:   
You can disregard the Lightning part completely if you just want the full node + Tor/EPS (see the bonus parts for that).

With all investments, you need to take on risk in order to make a profit. But you need to carefully assess if the profit is appropriate to the risk you are taking, otherwise you lose money. It's very likely that you are not able to make this assessment correctly. And you will be competing against players who are able to do this correctly.  
But even if you are a good trader: you also can lose money simply by variance (if you bet money that a coin will five time out of ten flips land on tails, you are making a correct"investment", but you will still be losing money just for mathematical variance).  
You also guaranteed to lose money in fees and taxes.  
TL;DR: you most likely will lose money by trading in the long run. There are no "safe" trades.

Theoretically, it is not strictly bound to the internet. You already can download blocks by satellite, propagate transactions by SMS or radio waves, and transact coins in "physical" forms on devices such as Opendime.  
I'm sure if a necessity arises, these and other things would be developed further to reduce the dependency on the internet.

1) + 2) are objectively correct and I fully agree here 
3) is subjective and also debatable. $20 payments might fail at the moment due routing problems (see 1 and 2), but I don't think it's going to be an issue in the months to come. Still, even then it won't be advisable sending your life savings over LN :)

"Starting trading" is the best way to *lose* bitcoin. For getting *familiar* with it:   
The way to earn bitcoin is as with any other money: offer goods or services in exchange for bitcoin. I know it doesn't help much probably, but if you want to have money, you have to work for it somehow. Ask to be paid in bitcoin. Or at least find a way how to exchange your earned money into bitcoin. This can be a little tricky as a minor, but there are multiple different ways if you want it enough (bitcoin ATMs, in-person purchases at meetups or through friends, asking parents to buy at an exchange etc).  
Visit r/bitcoinbeginners for questions if you don't understand something. Take your time to learn, but it's better to put in effort beforehand, so you don't fall for scams or screw something up etc.

you have to copy the whole "bitcoin core" folder to the new destination, in order for the software to pick up where it has left.  
But don't worry, your coins are where are they supposed to be (as long as the transaction went through correctly and has been confirmed). It's just that the client needs to catch up with the blockchain in order to display it correctly.  
Your other option would be to export the private key (the 24 words) and import it into a new wallet (hardware wallet, preferably), which then would show you the correct balance.

Fair point.  
So in UK you have options to buy it for GBP from something like bittylicious or ATMs, but you'll pay a high premium (5-10%) for the convenience (no acc, quick, anonymously) and your buying amounts are quite limited.  
You can go to localbitcoins.com, but they have introduced KYC lately, as I've heard. Also usually a premium.  
Exchanges: not sure if there's one taking GBP deposits (Coinfloor does, but they introduced a 10k deposit minimum). You can get Revolut (banking app), deposit GBP on it, convert to EUR without fees and then deposit at Bitstamp (very solid exchange, low fees and reliable). Full KYC though.

You don't need to turn on the device in order to receive coins, only to generate the receiving address. If the transaction went through smoothly, your coins will be received even if the device is offline :)  
You could keep your blockchain wallet if you want to, sure. Just keep in mind that your funds are safer on a hardware wallet and don't keep savings online. 
But this way you'd need to make another transaction from blockchain.info to the Nano S...  so just to understand right: why do you want to use blockchain.info? Just for convenience, so you won't have to generate a receiving address on you hardware wallet?

I guess most people use it for testing/developing purposes right now, but there are some merchants offering things like merchandise (mugs, shirts), SIM card top-ups and VPN services.

Long shot, but since both Bitstamp and Coinfloor (and possibly more exchanges) have offices in London, perhaps reach out to them (or some of their folks on twitter) and ask them if they know where a functioning ATM might be, or know people willing to buy?

I am aware of two types of different "inefficiencies": in countries with stricter capital/monetary controls (India f.ex), there is a premium on bitcoin.  
The other one is a premium on bitcoin which is obtained through anonymous ways, like ATM's, localbitcoins or directly from miners (as opposed to KYC/AML exchanges).

Copying my reply from the other thread:  
There still seems to be a misunderstanding here. A node doesn't put transactions into a block, that's the miner's task. A node validates that the propagated, unconfirmed transactions are valid (no double spends, correct inputs/outputs etc), as well as the blocks (that are mined/propagated by miners) are correct as well. If they are not, the block or the transaction get rejected by the node.  
The node doesn't put transactions into the blocks.  
Edit: small addendum: you replaced "money send" by "traded" in the top right corner. I'd say, "send" is more correct, because you can send bitcoin without trading it for anything. The blockchain doesn't confirm if a trade happened or not, it only confirms that a transaction has happened.

There's a page which you can tip u/nicolasdorier btw :)  
  
If I want to have a similar tipping page for myself, how'd I go about that? I understand I would set up a BTCPay server account, then set up an own website and integrate the BTCPay invoices function on that website, right?  
Or is there an easier way to do that?

Glancing over the article, it seems all right, but a node doesn't have to be a "powerful computer". It can be run on a spare, old laptop or something like a raspberry pi (mini computer), or even on an old smartphone. 
Mining is different, that needs a specialised hardware.. but running a full node is purposefully less resource-draining, so as much people as possible can participate in the system

Usually, you get some back up passwords when you first set up the accounts on the respective sites. You can use these passwords to log in without the 2FA device, so you should save these somewhere offline.  
Not sure, but if you don't have these passwords anymore, you probably can de-activate 2FA when logged in and set it up again, so that you'd get a new set of passwords. But perhaps clarify it with the support first.  
Another tip: don't use SMS authentication!

Miners are trying to guess the solution to a hash in order to "win" the privilege of adding the block to the blockchain (thus gaining the transaction fees and block rewards as their prize). This process simply ensures that in order to add a block to the chain, you have to spend resources (hardware and electricity).  
It's called Proof-of-Work. There are many in-depth articles available, f.ex:

I just realized that bitcoin core doesn't support extraction of seed words, as it seems. You'd have to export the "raw" private key, as described here, f.ex:  .  
If you are not sure what you're doing, it might be easier to just let your bitcoin core finish the syncing and then access your coins from there. Are you sure you gave the bitcoin core client the correct path to the new destination of the copied folder?

This also needs clarifying. Accumulated work matters mostly if there is a chainsplit on the same chain. F.ex, if one miner and some nodes got out of sync with the rest of the network for some reason, started to build on a different new block and unknowingly split off themselves from the rest of the network this way for a short period of time.   
When they catch up again, their nodes see: ah, that other chain has more accumulated work, so we abandon our chain and sync ourselves to that other chain again.  
The accumulated work doesn't matter as much in this regard (it can matter as one indicator of consensus and other regards) when there has been a chainsplit resulting from changing certain parameters (changing the blocksize).

Here's the text (with some formatting), because it's a great thread by Giacomo (see the original [here](   
----------------------  
It's fascinating: w/ negligible exceptions, almost every single line that you can read on newspapers about Bitcoin &amp; related topics are ABSOLUTELY wrong/false. Not just slightly incorrect or oversimplified: the complete, exact OPPOSITE of reality!  
My favourites:  
* 1) "Miners use computers capable of solving VERY COMPLEX computations!"  
No, those "computers" solve one of the LEAST COMPLEX you could imagine: just guessing random numbers. Pretty simple. Then they have to check them against a SHA2 function, just like any other non-mining node.  
* 2) "Mining hardware VALIDATES transactions, ensuring they respect Bitcoin's rules!"  
No, mining hardware doesn't validate ANYTHING at all. It just receive (hopefully validated) transactions from full nodes: sometimes the farm operator's one, more often the mining pool's one.  
* 3) "If somebody controls 51% of hashrate, he controls Bitcoin!"  
No, even if somebody controls 100% of hashrate he still cannot turn invalid transactions into valid (stealing, inflating, changing rules). W/ &gt;50%, he can just CENSOR transactions, in the future in the past (reorg).  
* 4) "Blockchains are more efficient, faster &amp; cheaper than traditional, centralized technologies. We can replace them to save costs &amp; time!"  
No, "blockchains" are LESS efficient, SLOWER &amp; more EXPENSIVE (to run but also to setup/mantain) than traditional centralized technologies.  
* 5) "Blockchains are EFFICIENT, FAST &amp; CHEAP compared to traditional centralized technologies. We can replace the latter w/ the former to save costs &amp; time!"  
No: "blockchains" are INEFFICIENT, SLOW &amp; EXPENSIVE (to run but also to setup/mantain) compared to traditional technology.  
* 6) "Blockchains use encryption &amp; they are PRIVATE, compared to traditional centralized technologies. We can use them to encrypt/protect sensitive data!"  
No: "blockchains" are generally unencrypted, cleartext, PUBLIC to EVERYBODY &amp; FOREVER, terrible for privacy/confidentiality.  
* 7) "Bitcoin can be surpassed, but the underpinning blockchain tech is revolutionary (cf. 5&amp;6). We should research blockchain w/o Bitcoin!"  
No: blockchains can be surpassed (cf. 5&amp;6), but the underpinning bitcoin asset is revolutionary. We are researching Bitcoin w/o blockchain.  
* 8) "Bitcoin is mostly used by violent people to commit crimes!"  
No: Bitcoin will be mostly used by honest people to stop/mitigate/fight/escape/avoid/neutralize/nullify horrible crimes, today routinely committed by violent people: taxation, prohibition, market manipulation, etc.  
* 9) "Bitcoin's tech is trivial &amp; nowadays obsolete, surpassed by other, most advanced "crypto" projects!"  
No: Bitcoin is by far the most advanced, up-to-date, bleeding-edge innovative FOSS/Crypto project out there, w/ likely one of the highest concentrations of brain-power ever.  
* 10) "Altcoins invented new stuff that Bitcoin devs couldn't imagine!"  
No: ALL selling-points in altcoin marketing (tangles, ZKPs, etc.) have previously been evaluated &amp; dismissed/deferred by Bitcoin pioneers, sometimes even before Bitcoin itself (eg: PoS in bmoney, AD 1998).  
The end? Probably not, but I am sleepy, and 10 is a biblical number anyway (even if I confirm my absolute devotion to the tonal cause, 
And anyway, they were 9 points, not 10...I double spent 4 &amp; 5!����

You already are able to receive blocks over satellite, without an internet connection (google for blockstream satellites). It's not possible to upload transactions over those yet, but you could send tx's over SMS and there are studies about transactions over short radio waves (google Nick Szabo and Elaine ... Forgot her last name sorry!).  
I'm assuming if shit hits the fan, such developments will be accelerated and reach broader adoption. Not worried for fragmented internet with that in mind.
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:38:26
Be careful. Paper wallets require a fully airgapped/clean machine, so if you don't exactly know what you're doing, you are much better off with just a hardware wallet (such as Ledger or Trezor). Make sure to do your research to avoid scams and pitfalls. Always better to ask than to be sorry.

Do they do withdrawals at all?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:19:43
Yes, it should be all fine when the syncing is finished.  
The coins are not lost, so in the worst case you can get access to them by doing extra steps with extracting the private key etc, so don't worry :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:02:29


No, your IP address doesn't have anything to do with it. Your receiving bitcoin address (= public key) is generated by the underlying private key. When you export your private key to another wallet, all the incoming and outgoing transactions belonging to that key are transferred too, as well as the full control of all coins on that key.  
That's why it's important to never let anyone know your private key and also why you are not committed to a specific wallet.. Because you can always export your private key, import it into another wallet and then continue using your coins as before.   
Hope this all makes sense, it can be a little overwhelming when you are just starting out :)

I'm not a tax professional.  
I think the safest option would be to assign a fork (BCH in this case) a cost basis of 0 and go from there. So if you sold 10 BCH right now at the price of $1500, you'd made a taxable gain of $15000 and can calculate your tax accordingly.  
I think it's reasonable to calculate the gains at the time of selling, not at the time of splitting.

I'm not a merchant myself, so not speaking from experience, but I've heard good things about [BTCPay]( You need to tinker a little bit in order to set it up though, but the developer (Nicolas Dorier, u/nicolasdorier) as well as people here are generally happy to help.  
There is a whole Reddit thread with explanations and a guide, check it out:   
edit: I'm not sure what you meant "without losing money due to market fluctuation" - do you mean you want to transfer into fiat as soon as you receive the payment? BTCPay doesn't support that (immediate conversion to fiat) at the moment afaik, so you'd need to figure out another solution.. or just hodl bitcoin :)  (perhaps selling whatever you need on an exchange or through other means)

For your purposes, you don't have to figure that out. The software takes care of everything automatically.  
You'd need to figure out your private key only in order to back it up (offline) or for exporting your wallet's balance into another wallet. To be honest, I don't really know what the best practice for Bitcoin Core would be in such a case.  
I think it's enough if you copy the wallet.dat file on an external hard disk/USB, so you'd be safe in case anything happens on your desktop wallet, but perhaps someone else with more experience will chime in here.

Because it's literally just a blip in variance. There is variance in mining, there is variance in hashrate estimation algorithms (because "the hashrate" is not an absolute, clear number). The hashrate is already back to the level where it was yesterday:

No, the monetary policy is set by code, and users and miners follow that code. If miners decide to introduce contentious changes to it (raising the supply cap, f.ex), there's no way that the users will follow.  
We've also seen in the recent example that even 90% of the hashing power (that has been signaling for SW2x) doesn't mean much if the community doesn't follow.

I guess because there is no official price finding mechanism for the USD/Bolivar trading pair (because the government doesn't want people to find out the "true" value of Bolivar), so the government created an official website showing the (rigged) prices.

There is a set of risks inherent in an ETF (third party risk, mainly), but also a set of rewards (regards to taxes and "free money", as was pointed out).

Also, a bit OT regarding my previous question but concerning the overall topic of the thread: how likely would you estimate BIP148 to be successful?

Yes, sorry, they're not contradicting, I meant that the first one is answered with yes and the second one with no.  
Seeing your edit with the examples: no, your example is not possible at the moment.  
edit: to address your additional points:  


well, being able to close a channel at any time you wish is one of the most important features of LN :)  
"Force closing" means that the channel partner is unresponsive, btw (f.ex if your channel partner node went offline and you are closing the channel in that moment). Normally it's a mutually cooperative close.  


At the moment it's not very user friendly yet, I agree. Also, for larger payments (such as monthly salary) it probably will be better to use on-chain payments.

It's not like you take an address, do a google search and find out who the owner is. But you can use analytical algorithms, databases etc to make connections to identities. It takes effort and time though, which takes us to point 1. again

Ah thanks, this addresses some of the things I was wondering about the hashing power in this context.  
What would be the reason of BIP148 coin being valued at $2000 and the legacy coin at $200? Most (all?) the miners seem to be on the non-BIP148 side, as well as big businesses etc. Not that I like that but it seems to be the case right now. I assume vast majority of users don't really care either. So the scenario that the BIP148 coin is valued that much higher right at the beginning seems very unlikely to me? Am I missing something?  
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:12:11
I guess if Jihan changes his mind and starts signaling segwit it would be the smoothest way to proceed, but isn't it against the core principles of bitcoin to have any single person/organisation being able to block its evolution?  
Besides, is it any likely at all that Jihan changes his mind anyway? Which of the three scenarios are most likely to happen?  
Sorry if the questions are silly, my understanding of the bitcoin space is not so deep yet.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:57:41
Yes, that's all correct from my understanding as well. Thanks for clarifying.

To be fair, it was not only the "core dev team" that was saying that.  
Also, there is not really a "core dev team" that can be quoted saying such things. There is a Bitcoin Core Github repository and a loose, undefined group of people contributing to it, without commonly articulated goals or statements and without some kind of defined membership, status etc.  
So to say the "dev team" has been saying something particular is not entirely correct, although I guess not entirely wrong either. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:56:50
There still seems to be a misunderstanding here. A node doesn't put transactions into a block, that's the miner's task. A node validates that the propagated, unconfirmed transactions are valid (no double spends, correct inputs/outputs etc), as well as the blocks (that are mined/propagated by miners) are correct as well. If they are not, the block or the transaction get rejected by the node.  
The node doesn't put transactions into the blocks.

What is then the talk about signaling for particular BIPs or SegWit etc when running a node? Is it just a measurement for consensus?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:03:47
What would be a scenario where I'd need to pick a chain? My understanding was that if I don't move any coins as long as there is uncertainty, I can just ride it out as a holder?
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:49:25
1. go to   
2. click "fork" repository (it copies all the code to a new repository)  
3. change whatever code/parameters you wish  
4. You now have a forked copy of bitcoin. Which one is the "real" one?  
I'm simplifying here obviously. There are more subtleties and "Bitcoin" is not really properly defined, as well as "consensus" is also not very defined/difficult to measure.  
Proponents of BCH will argue that BCH has the same genesis block and shares the history with BTC up to the point of the fork, and follows the white paper more closely and so on.  
Another point to make, is that when you spin up a node with software from, say 2013, it won't be able to connect to the BCH network, but it will connect to the BTC one.

Sorry, should have been more precise. I was mostly referring to the upcoming UASF/BIP148 and the uncertainty and potential chain splits accompanying these scenarios. I agree that long- (and medium-)term bitcoin is likely to thrive but it seems to me that the BIP148 scenario possibly comes with risks or at least big turbulences (technical as well as regarding the price) in the short-term (around August).

Does it have to choose the *best* route every time? If my payment goes over 12 hops instead of 4, and I'm paying 12 sats instead of 4... It might be not the "perfect" route but certainly still great in the bigger scheme, as long as the payments go through reliably and fast.

Be sure to write down the back up seed (12 or 24 words phrase) and keep it secure and hidden (offline). That way, if anything happens to your wallet provider, you can import that phrase and all the coins/previous transactions onto another wallet. Be aware that anyone who has these 12/24 words would have the full control over your funds. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:44:34
Ok, that makes sense. Is the current outlook promising for a sufficient adoption (if it is possible to say at the moment at all)?
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:14:11
*disclaimer: only theoretical knowledge, I'm not used to accept payments in practice, so perhaps there are better practices/ideas*  
Usually it should be enough. There is a tiny risk that someone will broadcast a transaction with very low fees and then, while the transaction is still unconfirmed (but has shown up in your wallet) and they got their lunch, do something called "replace by fee".  
This means they can modify the transaction at a later point in such a way, that it goes back to them, so effectively they could scam you for lunch.  
BUT, this is a very tiny risk and given that it's so small, you shouldn't make the vast majority of your customers wait until the first confirmation (it can take more than 10 min, as there is variance in time between the blocks).  
Also, you should learn what "replace by fee" and "child pays for parent" mean, because if the transactions get stuck for a longer time, you should be able to know how to get them "unstuck", if you are not willing to wait for the transactions to clear. It's fairly easy to google. I'm not sure if the blockchain.info app does support these practices though.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:21:43
Thank you for explaining. This makes sense, of course SegWit and Lightning and other 2nd layer solutions seem to be a desirable implementation (for users). What I'm still struggling to understand are the reasons why the UASF chain will be valued $2000 and the legacy chain $200 in your example, given that all the major players of the space + the miners seem to support the legacy chain at the moment? And also the question of the hashing power... That newly activated [user mining pool]( seems so miniscule and only allows solo mining (and seems to be off at the moment). Not that I'd want BIP148 to succeed, but I couldn't find reasonable solutions in the discussions here yet. Or maybe I missed them, I don't know :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:01:30
What exactly do you need help with? Generally speaking, you just need to send the balance from whatever you have on your encrypted USB to a new address generated by Ledger. After that, you probably shouldn't re-use the wallet on your USB.

@_date: 2018-04-25 23:16:57


Yes, your old address will still be functioning and able to receive funds. It's really not encouraged to re-use addresses though, as it takes away your privacy. The person you give the address to will be able to look up all the incoming and outgoing transactions on that address and will know that they are linked to you, and also will know the current balance on that address. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:52:22
Interesting, thank you. I hope things will run out smoothly, or at least in the right direction :)  
As I understand the support is counted by signaling nodes, right? Is it not an easy thing to manipulate for UASF opponents, by creating a bunch of nodes (as they are cheap to run) and let them signal something else, to push the pro-UASF signaling percentage far down?
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:14:11


I agree with everything you wrote as far as my understanding of the whole situation goes, but I am not sure if a hasty solution would be better than an impasse. That impasse also could be viewed as a sign that changes are difficult in bitcoin and no particular group has control over it. There have been a few critical voices, urging to be cautious and not to rush things from people with a technical understanding much deeper than mine or of an average user and those concerns seem to be well-founded, too.

You're getting there :)  
1. "several systems called miners [...] hear about this transaction" -&gt; it's not only miners, but the nodes, who actually propagate the transaction and make sure that it is valid (if not, it won't be propagated). I guess you should formulate it as "Nodes propagate/validate this transaction, and miners are free to pick it up for mining" or something.  
2. " [...] into blocks called blockchains" -&gt; no, it's just one blockchain. It consists of several hundred thousands of blocks (hence "blockchain".. a single chain of blocks).  
3. "Miners apply a cryptographic hash function..." -&gt; I'm not sure if that's a good expression but to be honest, I don't know how to express it better. "Miners try to find the correct input to a cryptographic hash function" perhaps.  
The rest sounds allright.

Still roughly 2140. There is a mechanism called 'difficulty adjustment' that ensures that a block is found every ten minutes on average. So if suddenly a lot of hash power came in (or would leave), it would adjust so that blocks are generated in the same rate as before (it needs some time to adjust though) 
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:32:19
Thanks, great, I think I get the gist of the explanation!  


With this paragraph (as well as with the linked article) I think I am a bit stuck though. What's the difference between full and non-full blocks in this scenario? F.ex. the first graphic in the linked article: I understand the two options a miner has, and since the second option is more profitable to the miner, it creates an incentive for him not to prolong the chain but to "fork it", right? Do I understand correctly that this scenario only would happen if the next block he'd get to mine doesn't contain enough tx fees?  
So if blocks are full (= lots of tx fees) -&gt; miners don't have an incentive to "fork it" (is this the same as "orphaning blocks"?), as there are enough tx fees in the next block, which is an incentive enough to build on top of the longest chain, as required for a smooth blockchain building process?  Hope this makes sense :)  
edit: [this example]( by u/4n4n4 was helpful, I think I got it now :)
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:33:13
That helps a lot, very insightful! I appreciate your input, thank you very much :)  
You are speaking of "mismatched incentives" (only miners profiting directly from supporting the network). Is it an indirect approval of the proof-of-stake idea? Also some other things that you mention seem to be pointing in the direction of Ethereum (a more clear roadmap, distinct ideas etc). On the other hand, ether seem to offer more complexity (failure points) and centralisation (Vitalik as figurehead).  
But overall I think I'm getting your point what to look at in order to balance a portfolio properly. Good food for thought :)  thanks again

Sorry for your loss.  
I guess the most convenient thing to do would be to ask someone whom you trust and who understands something about bitcoin to have a look through your brothers computer/phone. It has to be someone trustworthy because as soon as he/she finds a private key or a 12-24 words seed (which are like a back up of your brothers bitcoins), this person would get full access and control over the bitcoins.  
Chances are that your brother has been diligent with securing his bitcoins without thinking about ways to provide his next of kins with a possibility to recover his funds, as his passing happened suddenly. In this case, it is possible that there is nothing you can do. But this is speculation at this point, just to make you aware that this is well within the realm of possibilities.  
As long as you don't have his things back, I suggest you do some research about basics of how bitcoin works, what a bitcoin wallet is, a private key, a seed and so on. Perhaps you'll get an idea what to look for on his computer or you'll remember something he mentioned in a conversation or so (f.ex. a particular wallet he uses or where he stores his private key etc). The information about bitcoin is plentiful out there and it might sound too technical, but don't worry, it's understandable with some effort :)  
Also perhaps you could talk to the police directly, since they must have thoroughly searched his computer, maybe they could give you a hint if they found something relating to bitcoin.  
That's about it what I can think of given the somewhat limited nature of the input you provided here. I wish you good luck.

The public key is derived from the private key. To know the private key is essentially having control over bitcoins "stored" on that key. So it would indeed benefit you knowing (and backing up) the private key and making sure no one else gets to know it  :)

Correct, that's why in India there is such a premium on bitcoin (because INR is not valued that highly by the market).  I guess the main reason for people to sell bitcoin for rupees is that they have to cover their living expenses or to buy something with rupees that they cannot buy with bitcoin or whatever other reason they might have. But the demand is higher than the supply in any case and thats another reason for this higher cost of btc in India

You have to decide, are you a hodler (= long term investor), or a trader? If you hodl, you just buy whenever you can, or monthly average into it (smoothes out the variance, but also the gains a little bit). Or, if you have "enough" in, you just hodl without letting the price influence your position.  
If you are trader, that's different. Listen to people, learn, read, think.. But for god's sake don't let anyone tell you what the price will do. It's a probabilistic anyway, no one will ever tell you anything with 100% certainty (and if they act like that, it's a moron at best and scam at worst).  
You alone are responsible for your financial decisions.   
P.S.: just because we went up quickly lately, doesn't mean we cannot go back down. To think like that is exactly the same fallacy that brought OP in his current mindset. There are no guarantees which direction the price will go.

I guess you could import the derived private key into another wallet of your choice and then you'll see if the balance/transaction history etc are correct.

That's what I am concerned about. The majority of the altcoin world just seems to be quite hyped up because of the number of new money coming in into bitcoin/altcoins. So if bitcoin starts to have big issues, this new money might start to panic and I am not sure if it will leave crypto altogether or sticks with it. The former seems more likely to me (I'm not very informed on that matter though), hence it doesn't seem like a good idea to try to hedge through altcoins. Perhaps going to fiat is a better move. Just thinking out loud, not a very well-informed opinion :)

Well, it is and it isn't. It's proven to be workable, but it's pioneering in so many things (economical, technical, social) and it's just at the beginning, so there are much bigger challenges to come than those that already had been solved. 10 years is nothing in a bigger picture.

Sure, if you held a large amount of bitcoin throughout the times, you'll be able to cause some splashes in the future. But it seems that individuals willing to hold for such a long time, are typically not the ones that would willing to sell it all in ten years just with the simple intention to disturb the market :)  
And such "whales" cannot splash it around indefinitely, because this involves quite a bit of risk and at some point you either get rekt, or made enough money, and you need to pay bills and other stuff in the meantime.
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:23:56






Yes, hehe, should have been more precise (edited my post above) :)  
If you bought X in the past and it appreciated in value, this difference in value (at the point of selling it for Y) is what is taxable. It's the same as buying an art painting in the past for fiat ($100) and ten years later exchange the painting for gold worth $500. You made a $400 taxable gain, even though the second trade didn't touch fiat money at all. In some jurisdiction capital gains are not taxed, but most would treat this trade as a taxable event.   


Yep. People have gotten rekt exactly because of that. Subs like r/personalfinance were quite full of such threads at the time of bullmarket in 2017  


Absolutely agree. Sadly, this is not the case in the vast majority of cases.
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:31:10


Critical bugs (not that bitcoin is guaranteed to be bug-free, but the more people test/attack/try to break the software, and look over the code, the better), hashrate attacks, liquidity exploitation on the markets, central figures of authority which can influence consensus/code changes, and who are also potential central points of failure, weak security in general etc etc etc

In the exact same way that every other transaction on the bitcoin network: by your (or someone else's) node, and mined into a block by a miner. A channel opening is simply a regular on-chain transaction.

It still is dependent on a network, it's just that the person with the shortwave radio is not dependent on an internet connection, right? Or could the whole bitcoin network actually be running on such a shortwave network (theoretically)?

Do you realize how centralized mining was, when it was only Satoshi and 2-3 other people, and how much more decentralized it is now? There is a trend there to see :)   
Also don't forget, pool operators are not equal to the pools hashpower! It's quite true that pool operators have too much power at the moment, that's why we need better mining protocol such as Betterhash.. but even without it, miners within a given pool are free to leave at any time.

There is "cold storage" and "hardware wallet". You can use Electrum with a hardware wallet (you can consider this cold storage), or just Electrum by itself (this is considered "hot storage", as the wallet is on an online machine).  
In any case, you cannot transact in or out Revolut, and as I pointed out before, you don't have any bitcoin there. When you get bitcoin, it's recommendable to withdraw it to your own wallet (preferably, into cold storage).

As I understand it, it doesn't matter for now, but it's important for the end of August (when SegWit actually activates) to see if pools "misbehave".

This is a really bad idea, esp. if you don't know what you are doing. See here f.ex, why paper wallets are bad:   
Use a hardware wallet, such as Trezor, Ledger or Coldcard. They are essentially an offline wallet, because the private key never goes online, and never leaves the device (except in form of a back up, where you write out the seed phrase on paper). But you get the advantage of being able to transfer in and out of that wallet (which you cannot with a paper wallet or other kind of "offline" wallets).   


Yes! Good thinking :)   


You don't need to "insert" anything into the blockchain. It's math and cryptography, but probably too much to explain in a brief post (and I'm not really qualified anyway).

Well noticed :) This is indeed a current problem, and although there are solutions being worked on (BetterHash by Matt Corallo gives more control to single miners, instead of their pool operators), it's yet unknown when (and if) they will be implemented broadly.  


There is a lot of additional cost though. If your plan fails for any reason, you burned money for absolutely nothing. You also have social costs (people might want retaliation, or simply avoiding further business with you). Also, if you manage do damage the bitcoin network badly, you kill off your own future profits (killing the golden goose), even if you manage to make profits by shorting the futures or something.  


Yes, BCH's hashpower is something like 8% of bitcoin's hashpower, so in terms of monetary/energy costs it is much higher, and I assume it's also much more difficult to get miners to collude together, because the miner network is bigger.

@_date: 2019-05-27 14:04:13


You don't own any bitcoin, until you actually have access to private keys. This means, as long as the coins are on an exchange (or any other custodial service), they are under their control. It's better to have everything under your own control, so no one can stop you from doing whatever you like with your bitcoin.  
Trezor or Ledger are the most popular hardware wallets. Make sure you store your seed phrase (24 words) properly (offline!).
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:58:07


No, you always have fees when you send bitcoin, but if it's not time sensitive, you can put in the lowest amount possible (perhaps check something like  beforehand). You might have to wait for a while for confirmations, but no worries, either it will get confirmed, or your coins won't move anywhere.  


What does the "history" tab say? You should see there all the transactions that occurred.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:39:54


One of the main reasons, as I already pointed out in my post (which you seem to ignore), it would require a (contentious) hardfork, which the network is kind of "allergic" to... One of the main value propositions of bitcoin is the immutability and stability of the basis layer. A contentious hardfork which would threat this stability is most likely to be rejected.  
The protocol is very hard to change for a reason. A contentious change would simply be rejected and the best it would do is to create a split-off chain.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:09:21
In theory, it works like this: you have your own local node (on a laptop or a dedicated device, such as a raspberry pi) and a wallet (can be on a separate device, such as smartphone or tablet) connected to it. For every transaction that goes in/out of that wallet, the wallet validates it through the node it's connected to.  
That way you know that the transaction is validated by your own node, so you are not relying on any third parties to validate the transaction.  
In practice, it can be a bit tricky. Setting up a node takes a bit of time (syncing it), as well as setting up your wallet to connect to it. There are some easier ways that involve a bit of trust (to the software), and some ways that eliminate the need of trust, but take more time to set up.  
The way you do it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to the process, I guess :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:52:25


Yes. That's the whole point :)  
You get the advantages of bitcoins on-chain security (because it still validates any opening transaction and you can settle back on-chain at any time) paired with the advantages of transacting off-chain (speed and extreme cost-effectiveness). Tradeoffs are involved, but they're deemed acceptable for the particular use cases that lightning enables.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:15:17
A market is a good way to estimate the monetary value of something. And volatility is expected at this stage. Think of bitcoin as a start up: any start up will have a lot of volatility (in its valuation and otherwise) in the beginning, as things are unclear and nobody knows what will become of it.  


This creates awareness too, though.

Will it still not hurt if your investment drops like something 90% of its value for a long while? If you can stomach that, then it's probably fine, but again, it really depends on many variables. And should definitely not be a financial advice.  
What I would advise you is to learn **beforehand** what bitcoin is and how to store it properly. Perhaps get something like a $10 worth and learn how to set up a wallet, how to back it up etc.

Trezor is a good hardware wallet but doesn't contribute much to privacy.  
OP, use Wasabi wallet (it can be used with a Trezor, too) and use its coincontrol and coinjoin features. Never reuse addresses.  
You'll need to understand what "coincontrol" and "coinjoin" actually are, but no worries, only as a broad overview. Maybe start here:

I have no idea what there is to complain about, given that all the presentations are being streamed live and there are recordings incl presentation slides afterwards.

Thanks for the explainer, this makes it much more clear!
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:42:00


when another round of same procedure happens (tx's going out to addresses O, P, Q, R, S, T, U and so forth), will you ban the same addresses as well? How many rounds will that continue?  
What if some of those transactions went out to well-known figures in the bitcoin space, or politicians or celebrities? Banned? :)  
The point is, "banned" coins can be propagated throughout the network and "taint" other coins, so at some point you need to give up the banning, as it becomes impractical/impossible. They also can be mixed with other coins (coinjoin). And not all services/merchants will care about accepting "banned" coins.  
This just won't work in practice. At least for someone who knows how it all works.

Appreciate the explanation.  
So I guess the way to regain privacy would be just to set up a new seed, by initializing my device directly with Electrum (not using Trezor's/Ledger's software interface!), and send my coins to that new address (over Wasabi)?
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:26:59
I guess I'd recommend either Electrum or Wasabiwallet nowadays. Wasabi has coinjoin feature built in, in case you want to "unlink" coins from their past.  
Be careful to download Electrum only from the official source (electrum.org), there have been cases of malicious versions! Even if you see a message in the wallet itself with a link to an update, don't use it. Just get the current version from their website.

Perhaps you want to look into something like   
But be careful, storing it like this (burying your seed phrase underground) has its disadvantages. F.ex, you are not very flexible with making transactions **from** this wallet. But even incoming transactions might be a problem, if you want to make multiple transactions onto this wallet (it's still doable, you can pre-create multiple receiving addresses, but this requires a secure computer solution, like a hardware wallet in combination with Electrum or similar setup).  
Also, you still need a method to create the seed phrase in the first place (don't use any online websites!), which is probably best done with a hardware wallet or a safe, offline computer.  
edit: just saw that you want to use your own machine to stamp out the seed. The concerns about the transactions and creation of the seed phrase still stand though ;)

This question needs a few layers to be answered in depth - economical, social, also it's important to understand how open source software/development works, and mining as well...

But there are a few things that are completely misplaced in an article for beginners.

Furthermore:  


Please don't recommend any kind of trading, especially TA for beginners, especially making such generalizing statements as above.  


Litecoin's lack of liquidity is not the only downside to bitcoin, come on. "Being faster" is also quite misleading, as it doesn't mention the trade-offs at all.

I guess somewhat valuable for establishing some kind of reputation/trust, but since nodes are free to go off- and online at any time (voluntarily but also as a result of attacks, f.ex), it shouldn't be of a big importance.  


Because they are not unique or give any reliable information (I could spin up ten LN nodes, all named "Microsoft" or " or whatever). I think it's actually not a good feature, as names can be used to mislead people (don't know if that's an actual potential attack/scam vector though)

I'm struggling to parse this. Is it possible to dumb it down somehow? I think one of my difficulties are the units - what are "megaweights" and "vbytes" exactly, and why do we have new units here in the first place, instead of bytes, kilobytes and so on?
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:40:57
You can use your node with a separate wallet, even a hardware wallet, although the setup is currently a bit tricky: you need to setup Electrum (on your desktop)  and Electrum Personal Server (on your node) and open your hardware wallet with Electrum (instead of the usual interface of the hardware wallet). So you don't have any "hot wallet" on your node directly, but you still use it for verification of your own transactions.  
Afaik there are also possibilities to implement some basic block explorers on your node, too, but tbh I haven't looked deeply into it.
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:28:30
*edit: I should preface by saying that I am in no way an expert, or representative of some kind of "community" here. I might be wrong in something, and I'm writing things as I currently understand them. These debates have been had for many years now and you probably will find better write ups/arguments/discussions by searching for them on the appropriate sites.* **F.ex, here's a surprisingly civil (moderated) debate between Jameson Lopp and Roger Ver on blocksize increase, which is quite educational:   
-----------  


Nice way to start a discussion with strawman/sarcasm :)  


There needs to be a hardfork for that, which is guaranteed  to be very contentious, and very likely to split the community, halt the ongoing development, cause massive chaos and disruption... For a 0.5-1mb increase in blocksize? Reminder, SegWit was a blocksize increase, we frequently have &gt;1mb blocks now.  
Further, let's say we increased again by 1mb. A few weeks later there is a fee market again and blocks are full. What now? We kicked the can down the road and have the exact same situation, but with a disrupted (see above) network, most likely a split one.  


Have you done some research, or do you have at least some credentials to give weight to this opinion?   


It's not about storage cost, it's about bandwidth/the initial blockchain download (which already takes days, if not weeks) and its verification. Also block propagation time: new blocks need to be propagated reasonably fast by the network, otherwise the likelihood of short-term chainsplits and reorgs increases. Increasing the block size directly increases the block propagation time, which is one of the issues here.   


Well, there is bitcoin cash with bigger blocks now and the market seems to have made a decision: it's currently worth 5% of bitcoin, and something like 8% of bitcoin's hashrate. Wouldn't you think this is a good indication of the market's sentiment?    
Another thing: you are saying "we". Who is that we? There is no community who gets to vote on something, or to rally for developers to code up something. It's not a democracy. You are absolutely free to make proposals, or better yet, code something up and let the people decide if they want to implement that code on their nodes.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:50:44
How do seed words reduce entropy? Do you understand that you don't *choose* the seed words? They are an expression of the private key, which is created by randomness (only if you use a legit method/hardware or follow best practices, of course).  
Also, you can use an open source hardware wallet, and connect it to an open source wallet, and to an open source node client.

That's all right, there are multiple ways of expressing the private key, and some wallets use the 12-words method, and some use the 24-words method. Generally, the 24-words method is more secure, but it depends on other variables, too (it's more important that the private key was generated in a random way, f.ex).  
If you don't have an amount of bitcoin that requires a hardware wallet, you probably will be fine with a smartphone wallet. But yeah, the human part is always the weakest link ;)  
Generate a wallet, write down your 12/24 words, never let your backup phrase touch the internet, never re-use addresses. Don't try to be fancy with "encryption". Keep it simple.

There are no specific rules in place. The code is out there for anyone to see/change. The most popular (by far) code repository is  If you want to see a change in the code, you submit a pull request. For a complex (or potentially controversial) pull request, usually there is a BIP first (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal), which gets discussed heavily, mostly on the [dev mailinglist]( but also on various other platforms. 
If there are no objections to a BIP, someone has to write a pull request (to write the BIP, which is theoretical nature, into "real" code). Then there is a review round of the code (on GitHub), by anyone who wishes to participate.  
After there are no objections by anyone, the code gets merged into the repository (by the maintainers of the repo).  
But still nothing yet happened. The new code has to be manually downloaded, reviewed (most users skip that part though...), AND manually installed by the user themselves. There is no one who forces you to update, or who does that for you (assuming you run your own node).  
And if something that is very controversial and contentious still manages it into the code somehow, user simply stop downloading the software, someone creates a copy of the previous repository (remember, all of the code is open for anyone to see and copy), and people continue to download the code from there.  
So in order for any (meaningful) change to happen, it needs to pass multiple stages and review processes, AND to be used by actual users.  
So if the blocksize didn't have consensus, nobody would use this software (and it wouldn't have made it into the software in the first place).  
edit: this describes the whole BIP, code review etc process in a greater detail (not relating to blocksize debate):

If the costs are justified or not - how should we start to address that question? Personally I'd say yes, it's justified, and the market seems to agree (otherwise bitcoin/mining just ceased to exist). But obviously it's highly subjective, as all value is.  
Besides that, it doesn't seem to me that bitcoin mining is as destructive as other enterprises/systems are.

What does "prepare accordingly" mean in this scenario?
@_date: 2019-05-04 08:22:26
What you think should and shouldn't be taxable does not really matter. Almost all jurisdictions I'm aware of treat crypto-to-crypto as taxable trades (except perhaps jurisdictions where capital gains are not taxed). So be cautious and research for your particular jurisdiction. Keep good records. And go to a tax professional (accountant), if you're unsure.

Yes, your concerns are absolutely valid.  
You have to understand though that the software (Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard) is open source, and anybody can look into the code to see what it actually does and if it behaves as advertised. And a lot of people did exactly that, and also tried to break the code, the hardware and so on. The devices got "battle-hardened" in this way and tested by many hacking attempts.  
In cases of Trezor and Coldcard, they also use open source hardware.    
Another thing is that encryption can be a beast and if you've done something wrong, you're screwed. Hardware devices can somewhat save you from royal fuck ups, because you don't need to come up with difficult encryption mechanisms and so on. And you'd still need a wallet, if you ever want to make another transaction from your private key.  
If you feel like challenging yourself by coding something up, go for it though! But treat it as a hobby and not as a hardened way to store any meaningful amount of money.

Correct. You need one node though to verify that you aren't getting cheated by the miners, or that they don't change consensus rules. This is what it is about (keeping costs for verification low), not about spinning as much nodes as possible.

It's not "in the hand of few people".  
Also, for critical transactions you're supposed to wait 3-6 confirmations for exact the reason of reorgs (intentional or unintentional). It becomes exponentially harder to reorg after a few confirmations.

Tough to disagree :)  


It's not about "mass consensus" (although of course network effects are important). It's just that what you mean by "same or better technology" is reached by trade-offs that a vast majority of people cannot recognize. There is no "better tech". Cryptographic, distributed, open source systems are inherently slow and inefficient and tough to scale. You can make them faster, but you have to sacrifice something else in the process.  
Obviously that's not the absolute truth (with time smarter solutions will be found, and it will be better understood which trade-offs are acceptable etc), but generally speaking.

Yes, unfortunately. Probably a lot of sites recommending paper wallets are somewhat old and obsolete (a few years ago hardware wallets weren't around, and in the beginning even software wallets weren't matured enough to be used by average users).

You can assume that outputs from Coinbase are already known to (tax) authorities and act accordingly. If you have "clean" outputs, you either need to keep those separate from Coinbase outputs (use a wallet that allows for coincontrol, such as Wasabi or Electrum), or learn how to mix them (use Wasabi, and understand how transactions on bitcoin work).

Trezor or Ledger is generally better, as those are hardware wallets (your private key never touch any online machine).  
Greenaddress is fully open source and there are known developers behind the project. Not that it is a guarantee for anything obviously, but popular, tested open source wallets have a higher degree of trustworthiness than unknown/untested projects.

This has been possible from day one and will remain a theoretical possibility forever, or at least for a long while.  
In practice, this is easier said than done. There are economical incentives to remain "honest" and there are real life/social costs. Also, mining pools consist of individual miners (and that's why we need BetterHash btw, so pool operators have less power over where they direct the hashrate of the pool), which can withdraw their hashrate at any given time.  
Lastly, there is also the "nuclear option" of a fork and change of mining algorithm.

Each additional confirmation = one new block mined on top on the block which contains your transaction. The average time between blocks is 10 minutes, so for six confirmations you should need 60 minutes on average. Note that there is a lot of variance involved, so a block can be found after one minute, or after 40. Ten minutes is the average time though.

You can connect your Trezor/Ledger to your full node, but it requires quite a bit of tinkering.  
You'd need to work through this guide (leave out the "Lightning" part):   
In short, you need a full node and set up Electrum Personal Server on it. Then install Electrum wallet on your computer and connect it to Electrum Personal Server. Then you can open your hardware device on Electrum (instead of Trezor's/Ledger's software).   
Basically, it looks like this: full node -&gt; Electrum Personal Server -&gt; Electrum -&gt; hardware wallet.  
It sounds a bit confusing at first, but it's manageable, don't worry :) Take everything step by step.

That's correct. Miners will be "paid" in transaction fees after the block rewards run out. If the economics work out that fees will be enough to provide a "high enough" security, is still open though (as well as the definition of a "high enough" security).

I'm a GitHub noob myself, but the way it works in general is like this:  
For a new pull request (actually updating some part of the code) you fork (copy) the repository to your own GitHub page, change whatever part you wish to change, then create a pull request in the original repository with the reference to the changed part. People can then review your code, make suggestions, comments etc, and if all is good, your code gets merged into the original repository.  
This is for actual code though. You don't need any of that if you just want to start a discussion or make a suggestion or have a question or whatever. For this you just open a new "issue", which is as easy as writing a post on reddit :)

Good read.  
I don't get the part of the argument, that miners will lose on fees, when they reorg. Wouldn't all the same transactions (except the ones with the stolen coins, which have been reversed) be also in the new chain ? It's not like the reorged chain would be all empty blocks, no?
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:08:16
I think this implies that other coins somehow avoided the trade offs required for low fees (security, decentralization, speed etc), which I find highly unlikely.  
But sure, usecases which are dependant on low fees but don't care about censorship resistant or security will be better served by those coins. That's all right, these usecases are probably even better served by current fiat payment networks.   


I've read these arguments in posts/articles in 2014-2016, when the "block size debates" started to heat up, and the urgency with which those increases have been proposed seems not to have aged well, so I am quite sceptical of such prognoses that encourage quick tweaking on very system-critical variables :)

No, if it doesn't get mined, bitcoin stay where they are and nothing happens (the transaction will get dropped from the mempool after a while). Then you can re-send it, or if you really want to have it mined sooner, you need to do something called "replaced by fee" (which might be a bit tricky, depending on your wallet). In any case, the worst case scenario is that you'll have to wait. Nothing is lost ;)

My personal opinion: it's not the day traders that are hatred, it's just people oftentimes mistake it for everything there is about bitcoin. And especially when newbies come here and ask how to get rich through trading coins I think it's mandatory to educate them that vast majority of individuals will lose money with trading in the long-term.

Yes, I think you're mostly getting it right :)  


Sure, making small testing transactions is reasonable at first. But over time your wallet will generate lots of new receiving addresses (all derived from the same private key), and you'll get poor by testing every one of them first ;) But yes, by all means, if you're new, make some smaller transactions first to see how everything is working.  
Btw, if you're "paranoid" (which is not a bad thing in bitcoin), you should run your own node. Otherwise you are trusting random blockexplorers and your wallet's node to tell you if a transaction has actually happened or not.  


Yes, it cannot be chosen. It has to be created by randomness, otherwise you open yourself to brute force hacks (not enough randomness = someone can guess your private key).

Thank you, I assure you that I'm not though, so don't take what I write for the "final truth" or anything... I'm still very much learning :)  


It's difficult to discuss from that starting point (as there are so many possible scenarios), better to come up with more defined attack vectors (like you did in the OP) and think about what they might do to bitcoin. In general, the whole system was designed with adversarial conditions in mind: assuming bad actors and hostile conditions everywhere, be it on the technical level, economical level, regulatory level etc etc. It is mandatory that no party/entity is in full control, otherwise it's too easy for a bad player to corrupt or overpower those in control and take over the network. So this attack vector is gone (at least, all attacks so far failed, but maybe we haven't seen the really big ones yet).   
Perhaps, for the sake of discussion, you can come up with some points how exactly "the wall street" can control bitcoin by creating paper bitcoin? I agree that this might cause a lot of damage and financial loss for people falling for those paper bitcoins, but ultimately, on the protocol level, there won't be any damage or any gain of control over bitcoin for "the wall street".

To be precise: nothing gets sent back. Nothing leaves in the first place, without being mined into a block (=without confirmation).  
An unconfirmed transaction will simply be dropped by the nodes at some point, and nothing will have moved in or out of the wallet (if the wallet/user doesn't rebroadcast the transaction again).
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:43:58


This is correct. But it only matters if you receive transactions through this node (= you need to know if your transaction has been included in a valid block without asking a third party). Otherwise it's irrelevant information, more or less.

So the issue is here to get a new seed from Trezor/Ledger without actually connecting to their backend, right?  
I'm actually not sure, but is creating a seed independent of the software? Meaning, that you should be able to attach a wiped Trezor/Ledger to a computer and create a new seed without opening up any software on the computer?

You described a mining pool. This is how most of the mining happens: individuals (or smaller entities) join a pool in order to "smooth out" their mining rewards. But your phone or old computer are just not powerful enough to create any meaningful return, because it's all ASICs (specialized hardware) nowadays.  
Btw, you might be confusing phone nodes (such as [ABCore]( node for android) with mining hardware. Both serve different purposes: mining is for attaching new blocks to the blockchain, a full node is for verifying and broadcasting transactions.

Paper wallets are not safe at all:   
Especially if set up by a website! Airplane mode will not save you if the website is malicious.  
Also, in order to sent **from** a paper wallet you'll need a software/hardware wallet anyway.  
A hardware wallet is the safest solution. But if you don't want to spend money at the beginning, a smartphone wallet will be ok too, to get accustomed to bitcoin. You should get a hardware wallet though, if you mean to hold any meaningful amount of bitcoin.

This wouldn't do anything for the network. You are correct in the fact that just spinning up some nodes is irrelevant.


Here it gets subtler. It's not about simply having as many nodes as possible (this wouldn't do anything for decentralization by itself, as you pointed out), but to have as many users as possible validate their own transactions. So yes, economic nodes, if you will.  
The point is to enable this for as many users as possible, because if only large players can afford to run a node, smaller players have to rely on third parties for verification of their transactions. Yes, there are SPV wallets, but they are horrible for privacy, as Aussiehash already pointed out. And the main thing is that they can blindly follow the hashpower in case of a hardfork, giving miners a degree of power which full nodes wouldn't give.  
u/luke-jr also claims that there needs to be some kind of a minimum threshold for validating nodes in order to ensure a decentralised/anti-fragile network, perhaps he'll chime in.  
But no one would argue with you that non-economic nodes (the ones that don't verify the transactions of their maintainer and just simply sit on the network) are important in some way and that we should increase their count at any cost. But the costs to spin one up (initial blockchain download/verification) should be kept low, so new users can participate on the bitcoin network, without outsourcing trust.

And yet this part of the community ("big" is debatable) continued to run the software and continued to use bitcoin, thereby giving their consent. I think what you are missing is how open source consensus works. There is no governor on top, who asks around what people want and then implements it if it has enough votes or something.* Anyone can create any change in the software at any time, and other people are free to run this changed version of the software at any time, too.    
And the blocksize was not changed **precisely because there was no consensus to do so.**   
Something cannot stay in the software, if there is no consensus to keep it there (at least if it's something that controversial). If people are using the software, they give their consent that they agree to what the software does and how it works.  
\* I mean, the structure of the GitHub repository kinda resembles a hierarchical structure, with only few people having commit access/maintainers, but the difference is that if people don't like what the maintainers are doing, they just copy the code (fork) and create another repository.

There are no such guarantees on the protocol level. If you leave your bitcoin with a custodian, there are probably ways to insure it in different ways/for different scenarios.   
By the way, you got this completely wrong:  


It is not protection from a compromised account. It is a protection from your bank going belly up. But even then, in a systemic crisis (where all or the majority of banks go belly up) this won't help much.  
If your account is "compromised", it's a different case and depends on the particular circumstances if you'll get your money back or not.

as far as I understand it, you can sync from scratch on your own. It's just an option.

You can't calculate like that, in a linear manner. If you ever tried to sync a node from scratch, you'd notice that the first few years of those ten are syncing very fast. That's because there were barely any transactions in the first years. As bitcoin gets more popular, blocks get full and there's lots more data. Two years ago the blocksize was even increased, so the blockchain will grow even faster from now on.  
So it's not linear growth, but possibly exponential.

Compared with the gold, stocks, forex and whatever else markets there are, bitcoin is a highly immature and illiquid market. This means, it doesn't take a lot of funds to move it. A large player can buy or sell large amounts and move the price significantly, additionally triggering changes in the short-term sentiment of traders and retail.  
As the bitcoin market grows, the impact of such "whales" diminishes. If back in the days you'd be able to cause significant price movements with a few millions USD, today it's absorbed very easily. Today you might cause turbulence with something like 100mln (arbitrary number), in a few years time it'll be less significant.

It is safe (assuming you use authentic software) in terms that your coins cannot be moved by the software (beware of other malware, clipboard attacks and so on though!).  
But you massively leak privacy to ~~both companies~~ Ledger, because they can see your transactions, group these transactions together, link them to your IP and so on.  
If they're doing something malicious with this data, is a different question, but by using their software, you implicitly trust them not to.  




@_date: 2019-05-10 15:38:48
just a few things:  
- there are no IP addresses on the protocol, so the ending of the letter doesn't have a correlation on the protocol ;)  
- there is no "reasonable amount of time" in the protocol language either  
- you don't need a fee for someone to check your transaction, this happens automatically by all participants of the network (those who run a full validating node), for free

No that's now how it works. It's a bit much to explain it all from scratch. Perhaps this is a good starting point:   
Very briefly explained: bitcoin's transactions consist of inputs and outputs. Input is what goes "into" an address, output is what goes "out". Usually you don't spend the whole amount (the whole input), which means that there are two outputs: one that sends the desired amount to a recipient and one change output.  
So if I have one bitcoin and want to send you 0.7 bitcoin, the protocol requires that the transaction is 1 bitcoin, of which 0.7 goes to you, and 0.3 goes back to me as change output.  
This has implications for privacy. F.ex, if you know my identity, you can follow the change output and see what other transactions I make. Especially when I combine this change output with other outputs in my wallet. But this you can avoid with an advance wallet, which shows you all the outputs, so you can avoid combining them: when I know that this particular output is linked to my identity, I can avoid combining it with other, "clean" outputs in my wallet (this is called "coincontrol").  
Or you can use Wasabi wallet to "coinjoin" such outputs with outputs of other people, so they are unlinked from your identity.  
Take some time to understand how this all works, it's a bit tricky but you'll manage. ;)  
P.S.:  


Don't open your 24 words on a computer wallet, even on Wasabi. Except if you don't plan on using them ever again. The point of a hardware wallet is to leave the private key (the 24 words) **within the device at all times**, and never expose them to another machine (except perhaps another hardware wallet). When they are exposed to an online computer, consider them compromised and move funds to another (hardware) wallet.

Yes, but cannot the transactions in the reorged blocks be simply taken over into the new chain? What's stopping the miners from simply "replaying" all the transactions on the new chain?  
edit: ooh wait, because if the reorg chain starts one block before the fraudulent transactions, all the transactions in the following blocks (on the old chain) will be invalid on the new chain (because those transactions are linked to the "malicious" block, which doesn't happen on the new chain), right?
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:43:27
the main reasons are twofold: 1) to verify incoming transactions on your own, without having to trust a third party. 2) to not leak privacy to third parties (like your wallet's nodes, various blockexplorers etc), which can see your transactions and link them together, link them to your IP, perhaps even real life identity and so on.  
Other minor reasons are: learning about how bitcoin works and having a node handy when you need one.

It's not the number of transactions that is important here, but the fact that it costs a lot of money/electricity to mine a block. The more blocks you want to reorg ("undo"), the more money you need to waste. Six confirmations (= six blocks have been mined after your transaction) are considered safe for critical transactions, because the costs for a miner to undo that many blocks is just astronomically high (and yes, a collusion of miners costs them money as well).  
There plenty of explanations, articles and vids available online on that, as it has been a topic since bitcoin's inception. I guess you might wanna research 51% attacks.

But there is no such thing as "temporarily implemented" in an open source project without a central authority figure.

Every other change afterwards requires consensus again.  
Although you also could say that every change is temporary, until there's consensus to remove it again, but this is semantics at this point.

Well, f.ex if you run a node but your own incoming transactions are not verified by it (but instead by the node of your wallet's developers), it doesn't do anything for the network. Simply having a node up without actually using it doesn't help the network, except maybe adding some more redundancy, but it's definitely not the main point of running your own node.

It's costly for the miners and requires a collusion with (majority of) other miners, so everyone of them will have to send transactions with high fees. If this collusion happens, it becomes more profitable for the single miners to deviate from that strategy (to **not** send high fees tx), and the whole incentive structure is back at where it is right now.  
TL;DR: it's not a profitable strategy.

As I understand it, it's correct that the private key (of the receiving address) is needed for the recovery, which Coinbase doesn't control. But it's an outright lie to say "funds are not recoverable" instead of "they are recoverable but you need to take extra steps to do so" or something similar to make the user aware that the funds have not disappeared completely.

we've already seen what happens when the majority of miners plan to hard fork against user's will and economic incentives (&gt;80% of miners were for Segwit2x but didn't follow through because they'd just split themselves from the network).  
In your scenario, you'd just create a highly contentious hardfork/altcoin. You'd need to convince the whole ecosystem of users, devs, businesses, exchanges etc etc to join the fork, but guess what: since the "wall street" with their 5 million bitcoin is a major "user" now, they obviously won't join you. So you just create a huge shitshow.  
If someone gains control over such large amounts of bitcoin, it's not your business, you can't stop them. If someone creates and sells 5 million "paper bitcoin" out of thin air, you also cannot stop them directly. You just don't participate in the scam, hold your private keys and educate other people not to buy the scam and hold private keys of their bitcoin. That's all we can do (and it's the best countermeasure, imo).

There are no other answers, except either a very subjective one (how much is a bitcoin worth to **you**?), or the answer provided by the current market price.   


Highest security, most well-tested by time and attacks, most eyes over the code, its code is simple and robust (compared to competition), network effects, it makes sense for a group of people to converge on only one strong currency, most developed infrastructure (wallets, exchanges, businesses, software layers on top).  
Edit: not saying that bitcoin is perfect btw, far from it ;)
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:15:54
Because it requires research and grasping how the current monetary system works, as well as either some basing understanding of certain subjects from fields like economics, computer science and game theory.  
Either that, or... some life experience (once you experienced inflation, censorship or confiscation of your property in some way, you don't need someone to explain to you what makes a censorship resistant asset so important for you).  
Add to that blatant misinformation that exists on the internet and in the mainstream media, which makes it harder to sift through the noise and find the signal for the average person.

0.5sat/byte is somewhat of a unusual amount (usually people go 1sat/byte as the lowest amount), but since the mempool has not been very busy last days, the tx has a good chance to be mined, I would say. Perhaps within the next 24-48 hours. If it doesn't get mined, nothing will be sent from your wallet (you might want to re-send the transaction in this case, or look up "replace by fee", if it's kinda urgent).

Stock market and gold are not perfectly inverse correlated, it's a bit more complicated. Bitcoin has gold-like properties, but it's very new, illiquid (compared to gold) and volatile. You might want to view it as some sort of a promising start-up, rather than a mature system/hedge.  
Besides that, on a short-term scale (hours, days, weeks) there is a huge ton of volatility involved and things don't move predictably correlated, or predictably at all.  
And also don't listen much to people saying "bitcoin is this or that", and for the love of god, don't base financial decisions on whichever simplistic statements other people make.

This is incorrect. Algorithms are not unique to devices! You can use your seed phrase from Trezor also with other wallets, such as Ledger, Electrum etc.  
Sometimes wallets use different algorithms though indeed, then it might get problematic. But there are only a few different ones afaik, so you most likely will find another wallet that supports you seed phrase.   
You also won't need a USB to re-import your seed phrase, if it falls out of standard. Then there will be hardware wallets that connect in other ways, or don't need a connection to a computer at all.

Because the latter doesn't do anything, as was pointed out many times in this thread already. It was only effective if people/businesses switch to UASF nodes to verify their own transactions*. One entity running a myriad of nodes simply doesn't have any effect on the network.  
\* also I would argue that it's not the absolute amount of nodes, but the sentiment overall (reaching a critical mass of users etc).. It's just that "sentiment" is a bitch to quantify, and at least the number of nodes is something that can be put in numbers (and yes, the number can be sybil attacked).

You have a blacklisted address A. You see a transaction happening, where coins from that address move to another address, B. This address receives ten other coins, all from different addresses. An outgoing transaction happens from B, to addresses C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N.  
Which addresses do you ban now?  
Furthermore, what does banning mean in particular? If I am the owner of the banned address A, and I know your bitcoin address, what prohibits me to send coins from my address to yours?

I guess if you can't figure out how to get Electrum to work, another option would be to import your seed phrase into another wallet and make the transaction from there.  
But after that, you probably should get your cold storage up and running again and not store a lot of bitcoin on an online wallet.

You'd be able to use it, but it is better to set up a new wallet because of higher privacy. If the hardware wallet gave out the public key to your wallet's server (so they can show you your transactions), they might be able to see all the future transactions to your addresses (because receiving addresses are generated from the public key).  
But to be honest, I am not quite certain if that's what hardware wallets do. I haven't received an answer from Ledger (which is kinda suspicious, tbh), and Trezor said that they don't get the public key, see the reply from u/stickac (he's from Trezor):   
TL;DR: the setup is usable with your current hardware wallet/seed, but perhaps it's better for privacy to create a new seed.
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:59:54
Good thinking :)  
Keep in mind that you still leak(ed) tons of personal data to the exchange. If you are interested in privacy, consider learning about Wasabi wallet, and set up your own full node. Both give you a higher degree of privacy (with your own node you don't have to leak your transactions to Ledger's software, f.ex).

Yes, creating a paper wallet with an online website is kinda pointless. I strongly would discourage using a paper wallet anyway, except perhaps for educational/experimental reasons. See   
The point of cold wallet is to never let your private key (which is essentially your bitcoin "account"... anyone having access to the private key can move your coins) touch an online machine. This means higher security, because it lets you use a hardware wallet even on a virus infected machine (because the private key never leaves the hardware wallet).

Major issue is privacy. There are analytics companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic etc, which specialize in analyze/scraping blockchain data, transactions and so forth, so you'd make it really easy for them to build address clusters and link them to your wallet, or even to your real life identity, if you reuse addresses.  
Vanity addresses are just the result of searching for a private key that would generate the desired address. Brute forcing, so to speak (though you don't really crack anything, you just look until you find a private key with very specific properties).
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:32:33
Because there is no authority to say "the fees are such and such", if you see high fees while the [mempool]( is empty, it's most likely that your wallet sucks at fees estimation. Change your wallet or learn how to set fees manually.

Public **address**. Public key is something different (it's from what the public address is generated from).  
OP, bitcoin transactions are irreversible. If the buyer is trusting you enough to send bitcoin first, you're all set. Perhaps wait for 1-3 confirmations (or maybe six confirmations, if it's really a life changing amount of money or something).  
Other than that, you just need a good (= open source, non-custodial) wallet.  
Generally recommended wallets are:  








Before doing the transaction, perhaps practice setting up a wallet with a small amount of bitcoin (like $5 worth or so), deleting the wallet and re-importing the back up seed, so you know how this all works and you'll feel comfortable storing a larger amount of bitcoin.

I don't see much in terms of some advantage of being an early adopter, except for technical skills/understanding, which provides you with an edge over your competition later. F.ex, Alex Bosworth, a very early dev/adopter on the Lightning Network, figured out some things about routing payments more efficiently (by balancing channels properly and "smart" choices about which nodes to connect to), and he managed to earn more routing fees than someone with much more funds and much larger channels capacities (Andreas Brekken).  
In both cases the earned fees are absolutely negligible, but just to illustrate my point: there are no early advantages of reserving node names or similar, but the edge of gaining some technical understanding (or establishing a brand etc) in an early phase can provide a valuable advantage in the future.

No, a blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, which are filled with data. It's just a kind of  database, similar to an excel spreadsheet, but structured in a particular way (you can only append new data in form of a new block, and you cannot rewrite/delete data in previous blocks).  
What makes it secure is cryptography, a writing mechanism called mining (for which you need to expense outside resources, such as electricity) and economical incentives for miners to mine (because they receive rewards from mining).  
Just putting a "blockchain" into a device does absolutely nothing. And storing data on a "blockchain" is absolutely senseless, because it's an expensive and slow database, although under the right conditions it is extremely reliable, immutable and trustless.
Perhaps this will provide more clarity:

"slow and expensive" are very relative terms.

it's very likely that at some point, the (unencrypted) private key on your USB drive either will touch your (not secure) computer, or already have touched your computer, f.ex when creating the private key or for transactions. With a hardware wallet, the private key never leaves it, so you can actually make transactions even on a virus infested computer (beware of bitcoin address detecting malware though, which can change the address when you're copypasting it).  
So a hardware wallet is more secure *and* more convenient for transactions

I'm sure Andreas Antonopoulos has addressed this with more eloquence than I ever will be able to express. Perhaps there are more videos than these, but these two come to mind:  
[Why permissioned blockchains fail](  
[Money as system of control](  
Basically, one of the central points is that as soon as someone's in control (be it the government, or a corporation like Amazon), you lose the whole purpose of being a permissionless, censorship resistant, immutable currency. There are more points though (permissionless nature attracts innovation and enables "innovation from the fringe")

this. OP, learn from your mistakes. Don't use paper wallets to store meaningful amounts of bitcoin.  
Why you shouldn't use one: 
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:26:36
You could import your current seed into a wallet that supports sending to bech32 addresses and then make a transaction to your new destination. You could use Electrum for that (only use a version you downloaded from the official electrum.org site, don't click any links, even in the software itself, that ask you to update!).  
Be aware that you shouldn't use your seed phrase afterwards, if you have used it as your "cold storage".

You absolutely can, but the critical question is always, how many people will join you? Having a multitude of your own nodes might signal something to other people on a social level, but ultimately, on the protocol level, it's completely irrelevant.  
I think during UASF times there were some people who spun multiple nodes on some Amazon (or similar service) servers, but if those are not used for verifying transactions, they are not important indeed, and cannot do anything (except some sort of social signaling).  
The most important thing for a node is to provide its maintainer with trustless verification of their own transactions, to ensure that they don't get cheated by miners (or other third party) and to provide them with a higher level of privacy (compared to SPV). That's it. :)
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:07:39
There are more levels to bitcoin though. As an avg user you obviously don't need to know much about the underlying protocol, scaling debate, HTLC's and whatnot, but it's crucial to be educated on the basics of secure storage, proper back ups, that the tx's are immutable etc. There is a little more on the line for the user (their funds), and bitcoin is very much in its infancy, so education is more important in this regard, than the technicalities of the internet.

Coinbase, as any other exchange, has the control over the private keys. This means, they have full control over your bitcoin.  
Also Coinbase is really unpopular because they have supported many protocol changes, which are considered attack on bitcoin by many people. And other shady decisions, like hiring a hacking team that has been selling their services/surveillance software to oppressive regimes, helping them prosecute dissidents and free speech advocates.

No, receiving addresses are derived from public key, which is derived from private key. So you can have a multitude of receiving addresses derived from one single private/public key. Any modern wallet handles that automatically - it gives you a new receiving address as soon as the previous one has received funds.

Say your domestic currency is Z. At the moment of trading X for Y you calculate the **current** value of X in Z, the 
 current value of Y in Z, and and establish the gain (or loss) of the trade in Z (your domestic currency) by calculating the current price of X (in Z) against the price you paid when you acquired X in the past. Basically, you treat it as if you were selling X for fiat, and acquiring Z with the same fiat. If X appreciated in value since you bought it -&gt; taxable gain.  
Then you need to figure out what (if any) taxation applies.   


It obviously depends on your circumstances and your jurisdiction. If you trade currency for a living (Forex trader), f.ex, this might get classified as income tax.  
We are speaking very broadly here and this wholly depends on the jurisdiction. My point is that most jurisdictions I'm aware of would treat crypto-to-crypto trades as taxable events. But again, it all depends on **your** jurisdiction, so discussing broadly is kinda a waste of time :)  
Just wanted to make people aware that crypto-to-crypto trades can absolutely rekt you tax-wise, if you don't know what you're doing.

How can one miss the point so badly as an economist. Bitcoin is nothing like private monies, as those rely on an entity for issuance. Which means, there is an entity in control of the monetary supply, with all the implications that this brings. Bitcoin is completely revolutionary in that regard, making the supply uncontrollable by anyone (as well as enabling permissionless usage/transactions). The comparison between private money and bitcoin doesn't make any sense in this regard, imo. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:49:36


It's not that easy. You have to convince a lot of different actors (miners, exchanges, users, "whales", businesses etc), which have different incentives and goals, and are economically and geographically dispersed (different jurisdictions, different cultures), to implement some highly contentious changes in a protocol. I would say this will be next to impossible for a single government to do so, or even for a group of governments. They might fool a number of people, but not the entire ecosystem.  
And just "steering 51% of users" into something doesn't matter, because a user does not equals a user. 51% of what, node runners, miners, businesses, developers? 51% of the overall population of a country? They can go ahead and create a fork of bitcoin, but the market can still decide that it is worth much less than the actual bitcoin, and then the 51% will simply have their own altcoin.  
And in the absolute worst case scenario (which is highly unlikely, in my view), say bitcoin gets forked off to a version where there is KYC requirements on-chain or something, and 99% of current users go with it because they have been brainwashed/coerced by a globally acting agent... As long as you have your own node, and someone is willing to mine, you still have the unchanged bitcoin version ;)

I didn't want to be snarky with my comment, it's just that this is the way how things get added to bitcoin.org, and how decisions are made, so you'll probably have better answers there (you don't need to be a dev to open up an issue), or perhaps it gets added by your initiative.

You calculate the fiat value of each crypto at the time of the trade. If you bought 1 bitcoin for $100 USD, then its value appreciated to $10000 and you bought 100 ETH with the 1 bitcoin, you would have a taxable gain of $9900.

I think this is a scenario that is contradicting itself. If fees are high = enough people value the block space to pay those fees. Which, in turn, means that bitcoin is far away from collapsing. "The market" you mention also includes the people who are paying the price for transactions, implying that at least **this** part of the market understands that the blockspace is worth the fees.  
Of course, certain use cases will be priced out, but other use cases will be still deemed worth enough to pay the fees (otherwise they wouldn't be that high in the first place), so I cannot see how this will lead to a collapse.  
Besides, if bitcoin goes 10x in price or whatever, as most bitcoiners expect, fees expressed in USD will rise 10x as well just by the price rise, even if they stay the same in sat/byte. I don't know how this can be avoided by anything reasonable.

I'm assuming that Paxful "wallet" is actually an exchange? This would mean, they batch customer's withdrawals (sending a bunch of them at once, rather than one by one), that's why you are seeing a lot of inputs and outputs.  
Probably you should just mention to Olymp trade that you've sent to their address from an exchange, give them the tx id and hope that they understand how this all works.  
This is just a guess from my side, I'm not familiar with Paxful and might be wrong.

Yes. Keep in mind though that for the channel closing on-chain fees still need to be paid (I don't remember right now if it's by the closing party, or by the party who initiated the opening).

It doesn't on the protocol level, but it might on the "real world" level. I think receiving over satellite is more private, as no one can sniff/block your internet traffic, and it's probably increases the censorship resistance, as internet can be shutdown more easily than receiving satellite signals. Depends on the threat model though, of course. And afaik rather theoretical for now, as you still need internet for broadcasting transactions, f.ex.  
If it makes sense or not, depends on the particular situation.

* Those standards are widely expected to subject crypto exchanges, wallet providers and others to the “travel rule” long followed by correspondent banks.
* Industry representatives say this requirement would be onerous if not unworkable for crypto businesses, and bad for user privacy.
* FATF “recommendations” aren’t legally binding, but countries that don’t follow them get blackballed in the global economy.

That's kinda incorrect. Running a node is **not** done "mainly for helping the bitcoin network become more robust". It's done for being independent of third party validators of your own transactions, and for becoming a sovereign user of bitcoin. The network doesn't rely on altruism. But it's obviously a nice side effect if more people are sovereign (=having their own nodes).
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:29:53
In reality, you spend crypto on Coinbase with this card. Physical retail gets fiat and doesn't touch any crypto. And if they do, they let themselves be ripped off with fees and KYC procedures.  
Furthermore, as you don't hold the private key to the bitcoin on Coinbase, it's debatable that any bitcoin has moved at all in the transactions involving a VISA card ;)  
It might seem that I'm nitpicking here, but it seems to me that such cards do absolutely nothing good for the bitcoin space (except enriching Coinbase and other middlemen businesses), and I think if you dig deeper into what's actually happening behind the curtains of such services, you might see it the same way.

There always will be some level of trust to something, because ultimately, you cannot verify every piece of code and hardware that you use for running bitcoin (your laptop, your wallet etc etc).  
But a good start to learn would be f.ex settings up your own full node, which lets you verify receiving transactions, without relying on third parties. There are different guides how to set up one, the easiest way to do so is to simple download the bitcoin core software [here]( and let it sync.  
But for your goals (to learn), you could set it up from scratch, verify the software yourself, straight from GitHub, on a dedicated hardware. That's a good guide:   
Another good place to start is to read "Mastering Bitcoin", available here for free:  (or as paperback/kindle on Amazon, or as free PDF on the internet).

It's a strange comparison. It would make sense to compare dollar cost averaging vs lump sum investment.

Just to avoid misunderstandings: the actual mining process happened with Monero, but the payout is happening instantaneously with Satoshis on Lightning (and the balance is updated instantaneously as well, as soon as the mining is stopped/paused).  
But the actual earning &amp; transacting of the Satoshis does indeed happen on a "third layer". Which is not trustless (as you trust the site to pay you out), but super convenient (as the user does not need to have any wallets/channels set up).  
That's the beauty of a layered system: you can do trade offs (here: gaining conveniency for losing trustlessness, and also enabling micropayments, which are not possible on-chain), which are not possible on the basis layer (which is trustless, permissionless and censorship-resistant, but not always easy to use).

Because it's still early and some important things need to be implemented first, like AMP (multi path payments, where your payment can be routed over multiple channels in parts), watchtowers (ensures that you cannot be cheated when accepting payments), splicing (topping up channels).  
Remember, this is all freshly new, the implementations are all in beta phase, and you cannot let loose technology on retail users without testing it thoroughly.  
That said, Thomas Voegtlin, the Electrum creator, said that "every wallet that doesn't implement Lightning will be obsolete in 1-2 years", so there's that.

In this case, it seems as his gf specifically asked OP to get her some bitcoin and he is just trying to maximise the bitcoin amount for the fiat on hand. But that's the catch: by trying to time it, OP actually enters some kind of a gamble (the price might never drop lower from now on, so you miss out if you wait, or it might drop right after you bought, in which case you got a worse price). Just get some (if she specifically asked you to do so) and understand that price is highly volatile and you cannot do anything to predict it.

Depends on the scam scenario. Do they just stop shipping devices and disappear (not a big deal at all)? Do they install faulty (gameable) RNG code, where they might be able brute forcing user's private keys? Big deal, but given that there are quite a lot of eyes on their hardware, it should be discovered pretty quickly, so I think the damage would be limited.  
In any case, bitcoin protocol itself would be fine as always. The infrastructure around it is always the weakest link.

They probably are, if you absolutely know what you are doing. But I think it's safe to say that vast majority of beginners don't know, and for them there are much more pitfalls with setting up a paper wallet than there are with hardware wallets.  
Besides, if they need to spend bitcoin from their paper wallet, they'd need to put the private key online anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:46:22
This a repost but a justified one imo, as coincontrol is a practice usually unknown to beginners and even to more experienced users.  
Example:  
You received three transactions in your wallet: one bitcoin from an exchange (which knows your address, your name etc), and two transactions (1 bitcoin each) from people who sold you bitcoin for cash in person (they don't know your name, your address etc).  
Now you want to make an **outgoing** transaction to someone else. You want to send them two bitcoin. The way bitcoin works, is that your wallet would combine two of your three UTXOs (because each of the UTXOs is one bitcoin, but you want to send two bitcoin) into one and broadcast it.  
But here is the tricky part: a simple wallet won't give you control over which UTXOs it will send out. With a more advanced wallet however, you'd have the option to choose the two anonymous UTXOs. Because if you take the UTXO which you received from the exchange and combine it together with one that you've received anonymously, a third party analytics company (like Chainanalysis etc) will be able to see that both UTXOs belong to the same owner and your privacy is ruined (as well as potential pre-history of those receiving addresses).  
This might sound a bit paranoid, but you should remember that every transaction ever happened in bitcoin (on-chain) will be there forever, and open for anyone to see. And exchanges, which store your data, are not an exception to data hacks, data selling, or complying with the law, as well as simply working with chain analysis companies voluntarily.  
**Dumbing it down further:**     
Treat every incoming transaction as an actual physical coin. If your identity is known to someone who sent you one coin, you reveal your ownership of your other coins to them when you combine coins together for an outgoing transaction. Manually choosing which coins to send is called "coincontrol", and is a required practice if you value your privacy.  
-----  
More ways to increase your privacy:  
- avoid KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant services in the first place, if possible  
- use coinjoin features of Wasabi  
- never reuse receiving addresses   
- open your hardware wallet not with their default app, but with Electrum or Wasabi (the default apps ask the nodes of the wallets creators for transactions, and reveal which one belong to your wallet). Bonus point: you get the coincontrol features (which are lacking in Ledger Live, f.ex)    
- if you use Electrum, consider connecting it to your own node (you'll need Electrum Personal Server for that, at least until Bitcoin Core hasn't implemented hardware wallet integration)

You're probably on the right path, but  


This is very stupid.* Get a hardware wallet, withdraw your coins there and **keep your 24 words offline** at any cost.  
If it's a meaningless amount of bitcoin, it doesn't matter anyway, but you really should adopt better practices of securing it in case in goes "moon" or you acquire more bitcoin in the future.  
\* humans overestimate their abilities to "encrypt" anything, they overestimate their abilities to remember anything, and they underestimate the ability of other humans/machines to decrypt some very weak "encryption". Especially considering the fact that your seed phrase already is online and a potential attacker has all the time in the world to attempt to "decrypt" it.  
TL;DR: your coins are not safe.

I already run my own node + Electrum Personal Server, but getting to realize now that it's kinda useless, if my public key already has leaked to my hardware node/servers :/

Your email is probably as easy to "hack" as a blockchain,info account without 2FA. It's possible that the attacker got access to your email and authorized the withdrawal from there. Or they switched off authorization completely or something like that.  
Only speculation on my part, without knowing details.  
Sorry to hear. Learn how to secure your bitcoin better in the future. Stop using blockchain,info and get a proper wallet (a hardware one, if possible). Set up 2FA on every account that allows it.

As a layman, I think after formatting your OS you should be good to go. Pay very good attention to where you are downloading your software from though! You should be all right with Electrum otherwise.  
Although I'd also suggest setting up your own node, like here:  and connect your Electrum wallet to it. It requires a bit of tinkering, but you won't leak your privacy to random Electrum servers.  
Or consider Wasabi wallet instead of Electrum. It has a good layer of privacy (coinjoin, coincontrol, Tor).  
But yeah, the safest option is always a hardware wallet. You can actually connect it to an Electrum or Wasabi wallet, so you are able to combine the advantages of a hardware wallet with the features that those wallets offer (and you don't have to leak privacy to the hardware wallet's servers).

I've seen your [thread]( in the u/bitcoinbeginners sub and it's nice that you engage with redditors, although personally I don't see a lot of value in another KYC-compliant exchange. I'd rather see something like anonymous buying of bitcoin vouchers in kiosks/shops which you can then redeem in a bitcoin wallet (like the Azteco guys seem to do). Even if it would be for smaller amounts, this would mean more for adoption imo, and for stronger privacy of the customers and, consequently, for the network as a whole.  
Will you at least implement bech32 addresses, Lightning and batching? :)

10+ bitcoin in your channel won't do nothing if your channel is not balanced and well-connected. And it is generally more effective to have more (balanced) channels than just one large one (if your goal is to route as much payments as possible). But earnings are completely negligible in any case.

It's a complex question and depends on your risk appetite, your overall situation (family? Debt? Work situation? Other obligations? Etc), your age, how much fiat money you have as a cushion for a rainy period etc etc... All questions I would advise against disclosing on a bitcoin related sub.  
A **very** general rule of thumb could be: have 6-12 months life expenses worth of fiat at any time and pay off all the high-interest debt before getting into investing at all. But any detail above that depends on the questions above.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:35:32
Bugs can never be ruled out in somewhat complex code. Destroying bitcoin is quite unlikely though, as 1) there are lots of people watching over the code and reviewing/testing any detail, before any change find its way into the protocol. And 2) even if there were a critical bug, the software can be patched and continued to run, and in a catastrophical case (where the bug is exploited in a bad way), can be forked off and continue. In the latter case the confidence would be shattered for a while, but most likely it will continue to run. Depending on the circumstances and the details of the bug etc.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:26:56
If everybody stopped mining suddenly, no transactions would be mined. But this is highly unlikely to happen. Look up "bitcoin difficult adjustment" - it ensures that it will be always profitable to mine bitcoin. And even if it's not profitable, because the price is at 0.1 USD, the difficulty adjustment makes it easy enough for people to mine just because they want to, thus ensuring transactions being mined at all times.  
edit: it's a valid question indeed, but it has been explained in much detail on uncountable occasions, and in better words than mine, so it's for your own good to try and search for answers before asking

The point of having a bitcoin node is that you don't need to trust any third party to verify your transactions, and you don't leak information regarding your transactions. But it needs to sync up to the network and be kept in sync (although you can also just switch it off and back on, whenever you need.. but it will take some time to sync up again).   
A node on a dedicated device can run in the background without interfering with your work on the desktop/laptop, so you'd have the node always ready. This is also important if you want to route transactions on the Lightning network: it needs to be online to route.

The issue here is that it does **not** let you accept bitcoin directly. Blockonomics is a middleman/-service, as well as Coinbase, which doesn't give you the keys of your wallet even. "Third parties are security holes", as Nick Szabo says. That's why the troubles in the first place with leaked passwords, sensitive information etc.   
I strongly suggest setting up  instead, it's open-source, without fees, without tracking, and you have full control over your private keys. They have a wordpress plug in as well, afaik.

The price volatility will decrease at some point, as the market gets bigger and more difficult to move, although this point might be a long time off.. who knows.  


Yes, being a sovereign bank requires a degree of responsibility and education. There seems to be a infrastructure evolving of custodial solutions, which make the point of bitcoin a bit obsolete, but if people want to use them, that should be their choice.  
There are also "partially custodial" solutions involving multi-sigs mechanisms, so that the "custodian" cannot move funds by themselves (they only hold a part of the multi-sig key for back up purposes) and the user has full control.  
So there is a spectrum of solutions available already now and it'll become more mature over time. But holding your own private keys and continue to learn about the whole thing is the best thing that one can do right now in order to get the most out of the things that bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:29:35
And regarding your 2nd point: you calculate the avg price of bitcoin you bought (overall amount spend divided by overall amount of bitcoin bought), and when you sell, you use that avg price/btc for the profit calculations.

There is always cost for storing data. How do you imagine it to work otherwise? :)  
In a decentralized network like bitcoin it's the individual nodes who are carrying the cost of storing all the transactions that ever occured on the network.

Those people will get pissed if you try to modify the network rules in order to store your holiday pictures on it :)

Just one of the ideas (copying the post from somewhere else), but be very careful and try to figure out what the local authorities' approach to things like this is, because they might want to get you for some kind of money laundering suspicions!   


There will be people wanting to send money to Syria, and if they can do it using Bitcoin some will go that route. All they need is someone local in Syria with cash who wants to buy their coins.  


Let's say a guest worker in the Netherlands wants to send some money to family in Syria. In Europe, Bitcoin can be bought easily with Euro -- using Cashila, for one example of many.
Then that party, (the seller ... i.e., the person in the Netherlands using Bitcoin to send money) opens the Buy ad from the Syrian buyer (your friend, for example). The Buy ad (on LocalBitcoins.com) shows the desire of the buyer to do a local cash trade in Damascus, for instance.

"Congested" is not a very meaningful term. The protocol does not know what "congested" is. It's the same as to ask, "is $1000 per bitcoin expensive or cheap?". It's all relative, and depends on who you ask. The only objective answer is what the market price is at this moment, but this also might change at any given moment.  
So "congested" might only mean something in relation to how large the mempool was in the past. But even then it's quite meaningless. If two days ago the unconfirmed tx count was at 100k and today it's at 30k, is it "congested"? If tomorrow it goes up to 200k, was today's 30k "congested"?

Bitcoin,com is pushing bitcoin cash as their "vision of the original bitcoin".  
You really should do more research on these things.

I'm not familiar with LCD screens at all, but if I remember correctly, I just connected my Pi to a regular screen with a HDMI cable and it worked right away. Might be the same with LCD? Although again, no idea.  
Some other things:  
just a heads up (cause you might have to ask more question regarding set up in the future): for tech questions, try to express them in a concise format, as detailed as they need to be, but without stuff that is not related to the subject. The reason is that most people who would be able to help don't want to scroll through long texts to find the actual question/issue.  
Re: helping the network: it seems a common misunderstanding that you are helping the network in some way by running a full node. The bitcoin network doesn't rely on altruism and goodwill of participants. Running a full node lets you verify incoming transactions (so nobody can send you "wrong" bitcoins) and gives you better privacy, because you are not relying on third parties (nodes of your wallet, blockexplorer etc).  
But also it's of course fun and educational to set up your own node :)  


This is really awesome! :)

No (or likely, yes, but they don't disclose it), they say it's an "algorithm" (although not sure if their wording is exactly this) and afaik you won't know it until you hit your limits and need to verify source of funds etc

You can declare it as a loss afaik, but you better have a convincing story.

Yes, you're right, given sufficient persistence and time the adjustment will eventually happen... Hopefully, our hypothetical doomsday scenario would happen shortly before the adjustment period, not the full 2016 blocks before :D  
And also correct that it's a highly improbable event, basically impossible for everyone on the planet to suddenly stop mining at the same time

Why so?
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:41:30
No, you're right on point.  
Small correction: blockchain is not the network, it's actually something tangible, something that you can download (you do that when you run your own full node) to verify transactions. It's literally just a chain of blocks with data. It requires cryptography, proof of work and economic incentives to make the data secure, immutable, permissionless and censorship resistant.  
 Without cryptography, PoW and incentives, it's just... A chain of blocks. A particular way to structure the data storage. But it's a nice buzzword to write articles about and pestering investors for money with.

Not sure why you mean it's a special case? The cap was an uncontroversial thing at that time (I wasn't around and I don't remember the actual discussions though), and later there was not enough consensus to remove that cap again, so it's pretty much exactly how consensus works?

In short:  If miners would cooperate, they would be able to "reverse" (doublespend) the transaction. But every attempt to do so is  playing with fire and gasoline for them, as a failing attempt can result in going broke or at least hurting them financially + possibly rendering their equipment/business obsolete. It's safer and more profitable for them to not cooperate.   
Doublespend attempts is nothing new in theory (it's described in the white paper). In practice, no one has attempted (at least, I'm not aware of) it because it just makes more money to mine "honestly".

She also has no idea what a peer-to-peer network is, apparently :D 


So it's a p2p network, but she is the one who brings clients together? Then literally every exchange is a "p2p network".

Speak for yourself, please. 13 months is nothing if the outcome is consensus and improved code implemented in a safe, secured way. At least if we speak about long-term sustainability of bitcoin.

It's by far not the "first since 2017" (and Bitmex deleted the tweet claiming that, because it's factually incorrect). 
It's a somewhat common occurrence and is simply the mechanism by which the network decides which block to use, if there occur two new ones simultaneously.  
But yes, an increased blocksize would lead to a more frequent orphaning. The title of the post is still incorrect though ;)

theoretically, you calculate how much BTC you gained in that trade, calculate it in $ value at the point of that trade and voila, that are your taxable gains
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:19:55
Ok, but why link it to a post that is totally contradictory to the title (and not even debating anything in the said post)?

I wish I could give some advice but I have absolutely zero idea about the infrastructure in Syria.  
Just some vague pointers: can you offer any kind of services online (coding, translating, f.ex?) and ask to be paid in bitcoin? There are some subs that you can look for offers or advertise your services, like   
Can you find out if there are any bitcoin meetups somewhere near you (you can make some connections there)? Perhaps there are some on meetup.com?  
Keep an eye on peer-to-peer exchanges like Bisq and Localbitcoins. Perhaps there are locals willing to trade bitcoin?  
Lastly, join Twitter and look out for like-minded people. A lot of bitcoiners hang out on Twitter nowadays and perhaps you'd find connections or at least some ideas how to proceed further. Or maybe there's another social network that is popular in Syria.  
So I guess finding ways to get paid in bitcoin and trying to form some kind of a personal network with other (local) bitcoiners might be your best bet.  
All the best to you! :)

Well, it has to do with the fact that there is no central point of control, which would be able to implement a democratic decision. Every actor has to either obey by the consensus rules, or find himself rejected by the network.  
The bitcoin network resembles more an anarchic system, instead of a democratic one: there are certain protocol rules, but no rulers who can change/enforce them, except the users themselves. It's a peer-to-peer network, where each peer decides which rules to follow, and if you want to change something in the protocol, you have to convince other peers to implement that change as well, otherwise you'll be the only one following the new rule set, and end up on a incompatible network.  
So without consensus (so that the vast majority of the participants agrees to a change) the rules of the protocol are impossible to change (at least, for a backwards incompatible change... for backwards compatible changes the implementation is much more likely).  
Tbh, I have no idea if I am explaining this clearly enough. Perhaps you might read the last paragraph ("Who Controls Bitcoin?") of this excellent article:  for further insight, or let me know if I can explain something better :)

Get a proper software wallet then, or create a private key with dice or by flipping coins yourself (even this you only should do for educational purposes), but for the love of god, don't ask random websites to give you a private key. It doesn't matter if what data you put into it, this is an absolute stupid idea (except if you never intend to put money on those private keys).

But why cannot the miners simply replay all the happened transactions? The tx's are out there, and can be included in the new version of the chain? There's no need to resend them, or to re-do any trade, because the transaction in question will be simply repeated on the new chain. What am I missing here?

there's r/bitcoindiscussion and r/bitcoinbeginners, but both have significantly less traffic than this sub. The best way to avoid price posts though is... to not click on them and specifically seek out threads that are about other topics.
