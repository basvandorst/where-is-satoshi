I agree, it's fun when your life savings are not at risk. The same reason gambling attracts people.  But not realizing why it's considered "the end of the world" for some people is absurd. When the strongest coin can lose it's value that quickly, it will always stay a niche market

This is stupid, whales can always buy in large portion of it, and frankly it's quite obvious the market is controlled by now.

Anything that lose 50% of its value is volatile and not stable. Yes this is a big thing for investors, and thinking otherwise is just childish

Who said it's a loss? there is still a long way down, 10K was the price early Dec. People here are just greedy.

Korea? it's not like all the money in the world was invested into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:48:51
just what people used to say when bitcoin was over 1k usd. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:15:37
I don't think BCH is the main reason, market is inflated with new coins every day

This is volatile market, you'll never have the right answer

It's hard to tell, bitcoin doesn't have enough history to even try to predict how it's gonna end. So I think for now any level is a very high risk investment. Nobody will be surprised if the market goes to 3k levels...

Or you know, invest in the stock market instead.

I wished it was humans who sell, the way it's done, it's quite obvious it's all algo trading

Maybe crypto already hit the moon, and it will always remain the legend of 20k usd coin
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:31:04
Honestly, if you are looking for stability just put your money in bonds. volatility is the mixed blessing of crypto

If bitcoin is used as investment it makes sense, inflation and interest affect all kinds of investments.

It only means it can easily correct to $800 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:17:21
heard there are some nice gains in Fiat, you should invest some of your money there

But we only hodl we can't use it to pay our taxes :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:48:06
Because bots in uncontrolled market can easily manipulate the price and create trends. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:39:31
If you understand why it trended up, you should understand why it goes down. Nothing special, just the herd is switching to selling position
