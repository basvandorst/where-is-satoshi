$200 billion in presents? If you have that kind of money, you don't withdraw investments and wire the USD to your checking account to buy presents. You buy them with your Visa Black card which gets paid off next month.  I wish people would stop using this excuse.

Bitcoin is currently ~$16 per tx.  Visa is 3% per tx (you usually don't see this though, retailers just incorporate it into sticker prices). I'd say 20 cents is a bargain for electronic payments.  Unless you have a mattress full of cash you use for everything.

Bitcoin isn't "hard money".  It's hard for you and me to compete with the megawatt chinese mining centers, yet it's easy for them to make money.

There's a big hole in your argument: altcoins and ICOs.  They absorb $billions and there could always be an infinite supply of new ones, just like starting a new dot com penny stock.
If crypto reaches full global adoption, there's no guarantee it will be with the original BTC. A lot of people believe BTC could get sidelined for something else (like the MySpace vs Facebook transition)

Objectively wrong on multiple counts. The federal reserve is not counterfeiting money, they adjust interest rates which increases or decreases the incentive of all investment vessels. Leases increase with inflation upon renewal. Pensions increase with inflation. Life insurance increases. If you actually think that's a threat, you must be a very young adult who has never worked towards a pension, owned a life insurance policy, signed or managed a lease as a landlord, or owns mutual funds (correct me if I'm wrong).  The market literally already accounts for everything he's listing and therefore has stronger growth thanks for the "tax" on hoarding cash.

So is that actual real-world adoption/usage, or just trading/speculating?
Anything to backup your claim?
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:28:44
The federal reserve TARGETs a 2-3% inflation rate because it's healthy for economic growth. Significantly more inflation than that is bad (hyperinflation). Significantly less inflation than that is bad as well.
This is economics 101. If you don't understand why, do some reading before you make this community look naive or uneducated with more posts like these. No one is going to take us seriously.
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:20:18
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:25:52
The federal reserve doesn't print money to adjust inflation, they slightly alter interest rates to bias investment incentive up or down, which in turn changes the overall amount of liquidity in the economy. Printing money is how you get hyperinflation (see Venezuela). Read the links I posted above.

$0.64 is actually kind of high.  Higher than the standard merchant debit card fee, and for no real-world reason (adoption hasn't necessarily gone up in the past week to drive that, only trading).  The market is still relatively quiet right now (more of a medium simmer than a rolling boil), but once things go 20x again, if transactions follow (like they always do), fees can very quickly go back to $10+

Someone who's been watching the crypto markets over the past few years would never, ever, ever, buy at the top of a bubble.  Those rapid 3-7 day skyrocketing green candles have never sustained in the history of any market.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:31:50
On the contrary, if someone were to start DCA'ing right now, and the price were to start rising, that would damage their portfolio vs. just buying the dip.  DCA is a good investment strategy for mutual funds that have steady appreciation, but not very good for speculative markets driven by bubbles.  There's a lot of despair from frustrated DCA'ers in r/bitcoinmarkets and other forums right now because they thought they were putting in a lot of long term effort doing the right thing, but it did not pay off.  I don't see any complaints from people who did single buy-ins during the low, long term trough of 2014 or early 2017.

Say I have $x,xxx,xxx in NANO on Binance. Nano only trades for BTC, there's no USD on binance at all.  Say there's a huge spike and one of my sell orders triggers and sells my NANO for BTC.  I'd want to cash that BTC out for USD so I have to transfer it all to Kraken (which doesn't trade NANO).  There is a 500 BTC/day equivalent withdrawal limit out of Binance for level 2 accounts.  I don't want my BTC to lose value from the spike while I transfer a portion of it to Kraken over the course of a few days, so I will tether it all until it makes its way to Kraken and I can cash out to my bank account.

If you've been DCAing since start of 2018 you would be pretty far in the red. If you've been on the sidelines and just now pulling the trigger, you're going to have 2-3x as many coins, easy.  Again I've been watching the crypto markets for 6 years now and have only bought in a couple times. These markets are easy to time, and very cyclical (scrolling over 6 years and looking at past bubbles). People always say "this time is different", but no, every single one of the 5 major bubbles in BTC's history look identical. Sure you can claim past history doesn't predict future movements (as people spouted in 2012/13, read those threads), but humans and their patterns of market speculation are a constant, and BTC's price is about 99% speculation driven.

Agreed, and that extra layer of security, redundancy, and usability requires funding and management...by bank fees and big institutions.

Good luck with mass adoption then. This guy made one dumb mistake and lost millions in unrecoverable assets. He's probably more tech savvy than the average Joe. There will always be lapses in personal responsibility, especially if you consider a global scale with a billion+ users. That's why it's super easy to replace a lost debit card, reset your PIN, issue chargebacks, etc. You're not going to lose a leg if you're irresponsible with your credit card info, bad analogy. These safeguards are a requirement for usability by the masses.
Several million $ (billion?) have been lost in crypto over the years due to hackers, lapses of knowledge, mistakes in security, permanently losing keys, corrupt players, etc.  What you're calling "promises" backed by corrupt institutions have proven to be far less corrupt than the current crypto scene.
