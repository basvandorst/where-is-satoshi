Typical first world leftist, 
The Venezuelan regime sets all wages and all prices, and seizes private property on a regular basis without any compensation and without a legal base
I get my propaganda from speaking with venezuelan refugees (I'm South American  not a privileged american like you)

Do you have the capacity to maintain a logical argument? It seems you cant, you are just some first world leftist wannabe, go visit Venezuela or Cuba and see what real socialism is.
Im a working class south American, you wouldnt last a minute in my neighborhood
Keep larping and defending a murdering regime someday you may open your eyes and reflect on the stupid you were

Typical leftist argument 'but but what about (insert other country)"
Communism still has the absolute record of mass genocide and human suffering
Pinochet could have used the same argument when throwing you off a chopper "but hey The soviet union and pol pot have killed more people! Now off you go"

Keep supporting failures, from your lofty position, are you angry because your mom didn't pay your allowance? 
If you think you are a shill in capitalism wait till you see a socialist regime the state decides what little food, toilet paper and medicine you get and no chance to complain 
I'm tougher than you privileged first world leftie have no doubts about ir
I dont need mental masturbation I just need to see some basic economic stats like the absolute destruction of Venezuelas currency by the regime 
But no, all those millions of Venezuelans have it wrong and your privileged ass knows the "real socialism" 
Keep dreaming its not gonna happen maybe you will outgrow it kid (when you get a real job), then you will know what a massive idiot you were cheerleading for a murdering, corrupt tyrant as Maduro
Also try to read some basic economics (Hayek or Friedman are a good way yo start)
I'm not gonna keep wasting my time with a bitch like you

They dont have a capitalist free market system, the state sets the prices and wages (a big reason for their massive inflation as the market cant regulate itself) they dont respect a minimun of private property the state can and will seize your means of prodiction at their first whim (the reason for the total lack of consumer goods as the state run companies are chronically ineficient).
They dont have liberal elections, they have commited fraud in the last 2 and police enforces total subjugation to the state (no freedom of expression)
They are a socialist dictatorship by any definition of the word, they are not communist because communism Is imposible to achieve (just ask the: Soviets, bulgarians, romanians, polish, chinese, cubans, or any other failed communist attempt)

And you can continue supporting a murdering dictatorship that has killed thousands starved one of the Rochester  coutries in South American and forced millions of its own people out of its homeland
