This is the process for creating an image:
1. Flash the SD card with Raspbian or any compatible Debian OS.
2. Run the setup scripts (on mynode github) to install all the components (like Bitcoin, lightning, electrum, docker, etc) either using their respective source-code or compiled binaries, and the peripheral web-dashboard.
3. Create a clone of SD card to create an image (which is published on the website)

There's no script to make the image from source code. Images available on the website are built after installing this myNode package and its dependencies on top of Raspbian lite, which you can do yourself.
Check the instructions and scripts in "setup" folder to install the package and its dependencies on buster lite or any other Debian OS.

Sorry, you're mistaken. It is open source. Few pre-built images are only available on the main website

Fair point

Ya, I would recommend it. It's simpler than RaspiBlitz and you get to control everything from a web dashboard. You can choose to use the free edition or pay $100 to unlock premium features like remote access.
It's being regularly updated and exciting features are expected soon. Check their website, Twitter and Telegram, and make an informed decision.

Ya, convenience needs trust. Hopefully there will be helpful scripts available soon to make installation more trustless.

Using 3 trillion USD as current money supply M0 of USA, if you want to be millionaire now, you would need 1/3rd of a millionth of total supply.
So, in the future where Bitcoin takes over, you should have 1/3rd of a millionth of  21 million BTC = 7 BTC to be rich.
