The customer has to opt their card in, but if you offer it and the card doesn't, you still get indemnification against most chargebacks (the ones where the customer claims stolen card or "I didn't do it"). It's not that common in US, but you should look into it.

These cards represent a MASSIVE security risk for (and from) whoever prints, ships, and sells these. 
I know several companies who offer this service easily enough and very very cheaply. 
So you order a few hundred thousand dollars worth of cards. Where do you store them? How do you ship them? 
The reason the prepaid card networks function is because these cards use remote activation upon purchase.

@_date: 2014-12-30 00:33:11
Absolutely. 
I'm pro crypto, pro tech, but super bearish on price. 
The problem we face is consumers have no reason to use Bitcoin to buy things. No reason at all. Large companies outside the U.S. do not face "3%" card fees, or indeed high chargebacks (due to 3Ds and pin), so will never offer deep discounts for using it as a method. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:21:27
A bit of both. 
Fact 1: 
Fact 2: 
Alas unprovable, but I have professional contacts in companies that process payments. Bitcoin adoption by consumers is not awe-inspiring (especially when compared to other new-to-market payment offerings). 
Feeling 1: 
There is no killer app type use case for the consumer. There is no good reason for a person to spend Bitcoin on their PS4 or their coffee rather than use existing payment instruments. For those who have limited access to payment instruments, it's a different story, but getting BTC to these people is hard, ironically because it is hard for them to buy the BTC.

Re: Refunds.
Refunds DO have something to do with the payment system; some payment systems support it natively (VISA, MasterCard, Discover, ACH, Skrill, Paypal, Neteller, Ukash, Abaqoos, some bank transfers) and some don't (PaySafeCard, iDeal, Sofortuberweisung, Przelewy24, Poli, etc). 
Some merchants require a robust automated refund protocol to keep admin costs down (e.g. Amazon). 
Re: Chargebacks
It is a great strength of the system, but it is also a hindrance to consumer - and hence merchant - adoption. Big merchants don't want shopping-cart attrition or intervention. I understand bitcoin very well, but I understand consumer and merchant payment infrastructure and attrition even better. The reason Amazon primarily uses cards (despite poor card online usage in some of their big markets) is because their process requires the refund / redebit model, AND consumers can self-solve non-delivery issues. Yes, if they accepted Bitcoin they'd never have a chargeback, but they'd have 20x the complaints, emails, manual cases, etc... which would cost them a lot more.
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:51:59
Nobody can give them a good reason to buy, other than the fact that they might increase in value, or the fact that they can be anonymised for use on grey-market or black-market service providers. 
The people Circle serve are (not coincidentally) the people already well served with online and in-person payment options.
@_date: 2014-07-23 12:20:31
I'll add; Credit cards cost 3%
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:49:34
Bingo. Way above the 1% that Visa / MC will accept, so the solution has to be a bit more creative. 
By the way, you could easily cut this in half by using a different processor for customers' third and subsequent transactions (where the chargebacks are much less likely). 
Your welcome.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:39:04
1. Many of the people invested in bitcoin are invested in the coins, and not the protocol. These people will stifle the growth of blockchain technology, as diversification and innovation that does not directly increase the BTC/USD price will be suppressed by this group. I forsee a future with a small number of BTC hoarders as a sort of "cargo cult" trying to steer the discussion to purchasing of coins, while blockchain technology spreads across the world (as predicted) and everyone else chuckles at the quirky "old days" when people cared about the BTC/FIAT exchange rate. 
2. Widespread merchant acceptance of cryptocurrency payment methods is BAD for consumers. The lack of appropriate reversal, refund and dispute protocols is a massive - MASSIVE - limitation. Amazon want to be able to refund you. They also want to be able to charge you twice if they need to. This is why Amazon don't take them today. They don't fit their model. They are working to fit the crypto model to their business model, but it's hard. It's not just a "pay with bitcoin" button, people. 
3. Burning all that power to keep the network humming is a massive, MASSIVE waste of energy. Something so wasteful is not sustainable. The day will come when blockchain infrastructure users will just switch blockchain rather than update the bitcoin protocol (see point 1.)
4. People want to trust authority. They want to know the ambulance will come when they call 911 because it is someone's job to drive it to them, not because the ambulance driver cares about their welfare. Decentralised and trust-less technology is awesome, but people (for better or worse) prefer someone they "know". People don't really trust themselves.

In the industry I work in third party management is a key part of what we do. Mitigating their operational risks, credit risk, reputational risk is literally a full time job for several people.
The irony is that on this forum people say "use Bitpay to get rid of the exchange risk" and several businesses are not doing business with third party processors exactly because of the risks in doing so. It's not that we don't trust them, it's that they themselves are subject to risks outside their control. 
A good business owns their risk, measures it, and manages it effectively. Manage your holes, so to speak. 
Other security holes include customers, employees, and garbagemen. I've been burned in various companies by all three.

Number of AtMs is not a fundamental. 
There is no mass market use case for consumers to use Bitcoin above other payment methods.

Offering a subscription service for bitcoin is really not a good idea. Much more attrition and declined payments than with cards. This far outweighs the small cost saving (fees / chargebacks). 
Also; as a consumer cards are preferable due to the ability to chargeback, right? 
The only merchant benefits for this type of service are reaching new customers who want to use bitcoin. 
Alas, these are few and far between. The hoarders hoard. The investors hoard. The actual spenders, are very very niche. And they pretty much all have credit cards.

You would need a peer-to-peer request matching service with the ability for the seller of the coin to accept cards (e.g. using PayPal or Square or similar). 
However the issue here is that trust becomes a massive issue, as fraudsters and carders would flock to the service, causing many sellers problems with their card-acceptance channels.

"that's one hell of a logical fallacy. you're assuming bitcoins alone and not any other crypto needs to handle the whole world's commerce, or that because bitcoins are artificially limited versus other cryptocoins that we must respect that limit with a higher valuation per coin instead of just using a less-limited crypto with a lower price per coin?
Like, you're literally just counting on people paying more and more for bitcoins because bitcoin owners say they are so important and you shouldn't use other cryptos even though they work the same and other cryptos aren't 10% owned by thieves"
I completely agree. I'm very pro-crypto (for money transmission and other applications) but I believe we are about 6-12 months from the "Bitcoin" application being more or less a millstone around the technology's neck. 
I work with a very large online merchant, and when reviewing our BTC acceptance plans have basically realized that our whole short term business case is getting existing BTC holders to spend with us (a la overstock).
Long term any crypto that can be reconverted to FIAT is of equal value to us.

The blockchain-protocol concept is the innovation, the genius, the creation... that is the thing that will almost certainly persist for a long time. 
The bitcoin / flat exchange rate has meant that miners and investors have had incredible fiat returns over the past couple of years. People want to be part of it, so invest in "bitcoin" by buying it. 
However, I believe the next wave of innovation will be creating further APPLICATIONS of the protocol. Investors are investing in blockchain related businesses, that will succeed irrespective of the base coin. 
What bitcoin has going for is is a LOT of miners being paid to create the infrastructure. The BTC/USD rate will be sustained as long as that is the case. If miners can be incentivised to switch to an easier blockchain, they will do so, and that will spell doom for the hoarders.

Masterpass is old news. And it is NOTHING like PayPal. 
It's basically an online account that stores all your card information. When paying online you click "MasterPass", log in, choose the card you want to pay with, and that's it. You never enter your card information online.
However this part "There they enter their MasterPass username and password, which authorises the transaction without passing the payment-card details to the retailer." is not true. They basically send the customers chosen card information BACK to the merchant, from where it is sent as normal for processing. 
From the MasterPass merchant information page ( "MasterPass then securely transfers the consumer's payment and shipping information to your website's confirmation page, where he/she then completes checkout. Finally, you submit the consumer's payment information to your acquirer as usual for processing."

Sure. 
When recreational players gather to play poker it is to have a bit of fun, maybe win some money, etc. They want a fair game, a nice player experience, etc. 
Serious poker players gather to win money. They focus on their winrate, their BB/hr. They want to be able to cashout, and they want the site to provide them a steady stream of weaker players, and they want low rake. 
All poker games (other than very friendly home games) operate on this principle. 
I have seen plenty of poker sites come and go focussing on attracting serious players to play serious poker. However no serious player worth their salt will actually sit at the table with only other serious players. They want people willing to inject money into the game, repeatedly. They will turn up every night if you can guarantee this, filling several seats at each table, keeping your revenue flowing, and your games going day and night. 
If you don't provide producers (even a single, HUGE, producer), the serious players stop coming. 
Bringing in recreational players is ex-pen-sive, especially online. 
EDIT: I see you are not trying to create a revenue generating site. This makes your proposition a little more feasible. Just bear in mind that you will never - ever - get serious players to play poker in a closed club.

Re: chargebacks... I am painfully aware of the cost of chargebacks, but know that with the right internal processes a large business can mitigate most of this cost. I've seen 1%/2% thrown around as typical chargeback rates. I can tell you that those numbers are grossly overinflated (the schemes wouldn't tolerate &gt;1% rates for more than a month or two). Many large businesses have sub 0.20% loss rates.

It's because your CUSTOMERS want to use PayPal, that you accept Paypal. 
I work for a very large online merchant. We have well over 50 payment methods worldwide, some as small as 20-30k per month in volume. Some countries have over 10 methods on their own! 
The reason we do this is to increase reach, and hence increase revenue. Paypal fees are worth paying in some markets because they give you easy reach to their customers. 
It's not always about price. Some payment methods cost &lt;1% or less, some cost 7-10%, some cost less than zero, each of them has a place in a big business.

Nope. I work in the private sector, but I will try and elaborate. 
Consider the subscription model; World of Warcraft, Barkbox, whatever. A critical part of your business - arguably the most critical part of your business - is the ability to have frictionless recurring payments. So in Germany you use ELV, in US / Canada you use NACHA or equivalent, and everywhere else ( more or less ) you use cards (with a small niche for PayPal). There are dozens of other payment solutions worldwide; cheaper, faster, more widespread, anonymous... but they suffer from the lack of a reliable recurring payments protocol. For example take PaySafeCard; it's huge in Central Europe, especially for digital content, but must be topped up or repurchased. So you can subscribe to WOW with it, but any month you forget to top up or pay, the subscription ends or is suspended. Merchants rely on this stability of service - so WoW need to deal with thousands of customers each month reactivating their subscriptions with all the account complexities that entails. Also, lots of customers just don't renew. In the Barkbox example, the supply chain management depends on a reliable payment - they start packing the boxes BEFORE the card is debited, knowing a pre-authed card has a very high approval rate. 
The bitcoin solution is "reuse same address" but that's fine for a smallish percentage of users, but many don't keep their addresses loaded with much coin for day-to-day use. So you get a lot of declines, you've packed your barkboxes (cost), and you contact the customer (cost) and he says "oh sure here you go" or "maybe next month" or "I'll pay in a few days". Doesn't suit the sub model. 
If you work in the subscription business (or know someone who does) the above will be very very familiar to you.

When I talk about bitcoin, this is what I talk about. 
Feel free to edit as needed. 
1. Bitcoin is a big public ledger maintained, verified, and updated by thousands of worldwide users. No central person or company "owns" or "operates" bitcoin. 
2. Your entry on the ledger is public, but only if you choose to say which one is yours (by sharing your "public address"). 
3. Only you can spend your balance on the ledger - by using your "private key". 
4. A huge network of Bitcoin users ("miners") is constantly working to process transactions, update balances, and keep the ledger up to date. This is done publicly, but using cryptography to ensure security. They are paid for their work.
5. Anyone can send bitcoins, anywhere, at any time - all you need are your own private key and the recipients public address. 
6. Many companies and individuals are investing in infrastructure, technology and other services based on the bitcoin network. 
7. Many companies and individuals are working to develop enhancements to the bitcoin network, to make it faster and more user-friendly.

(relevant for sales, not payment, but relevant nonetheless)
The problem at the moment for Amazon, is that when people use single-shot payment methods it is much more difficult for Amazon to manage the transaction. 
When you use a bank account, or card, they can refund easily, debit again easily (which they do for double-shipped items or recovered lost items) etc. The protocols for this are well known and well established. 
You need to convince them that the marginal cost of card / bank payments (fees and fraud) is worth the reduction in hassle and operational cost. And the additional hassle of handling refunds to players who use one-directional payment methods without automated refund protocols. 
They also would be taking on a massive amount of credit risk by dealing with an exchange; before screaming "THERE'S NO RISK USING BITPAY", Amazon must look at the durability and credit-worthiness of Bitpay (or any exchange / processor) before entrusting them with a large amount of money. 
I can 100% assure you that Amazon's payments guys are not supporting BTC out of choice, not out of apathy. That choice may change, maybe very soon, but you better believe they've thought about it.

"I'm now inviting you to suggest any change that they may want that can't be implemented either via a service, or is unlikely to make it into a soft/hard fork"
I'm not taking the bait. I'm sure changes that are worth doing are likely to make it into a fork. I'm not sure that that will always be preferable than jumping to an alt-chain. 
There are 3 reasons to accept BTC as a merchant;
1. To get access to the massive stored values of BTC held by adopters and investors.
2. To attract consumers who like using bitcoin for it's own sake. 
3. Philosophical reasons
4. Getting payments from consumers whose only access to online payments is via bitcoin
However what we merchants know is that 








And the dirty secret? Amazon / eBay / etc could have a bitcoin logo deployed in their paywall in &lt;12 hours if they REALLY wanted too. If the above changes, they can change (fast). 
However let's imagine that amazon believed that item 2 had grown so large as to be worth their while. They look at bitcoin and decide "hmm burning all that electricity is bad, as we have a policy of zero emissions for our business. let's see if we can get bitcoin to proof of stake."
And then some smart guy says "lets just use darkcoin, it's reasonably secure now, and with our support we'll have nodes and miners aplenty in no time."
By the way, the above is not entirely hypothetical; these discussions ARE happening in VERY LARGE merchants, right now, today.

Interchange (the amount the bank gets) is set in Europe by VISA at; 




(this info is in the public domain)
Depending on who your processor is (and your size), you can get scheme fees (paid to VISA) as low as 0.05% and the PSP fee (paid to the processor) as low as 0.05% + 0.015 per transaction. 
So for debit that's 


And for credit that's 


For debit (vast majority of European cards) that's just under 0.25% for $200 transactions and 0.35% for credit. 
EDIT: OK I misspoke in OP. More like 0.3% overall for European card processing. 
And this is NOT the company we use for my day-to-day banking, they settle direct to our bank account though. 
NOTE: We are a large merchant.

There is no killer app type use case for the consumer. There is no good reason for a person to spend Bitcoin on their PS4 or their coffee rather than use existing payment instruments.

Answer; enthusiasts. Not holders or speculators. 
And trying to make money from enthusiasts is ... shall we say ... hard. 
So a serious suggestion to increase the price? 
(a) reduce the mining reward by 10x or even 100x
This will make mining a race to process the most transaction blocks with the biggest fees. Faster tx will cost more. Slower tx will cost nothing.  
Yes, this will have a catastrophic effect on the mining community, but they are in the middle of a catastrophe anyway with the hashrate growing exponentially every change.

I am extremely positive (and investing) in crypto technology and digital currency technology. I think this is the future. 
But I also believe that the BTC/USD price is going to drop significantly in the next 18 months. 
I believe a peer-to-peer no-trust-required network is going to transform financial services and communication, but not in terms of the price in USD of BTC. As BTC becomes more and more scarce relative to use, the incentive to fork to another blockchain grows. With enough big players independently invested (say, for example, Amazon), it only takes a few of them to 'fork' to another chain and bring mining infrastructure with them. 
Bitcoin's power today is it's massive mining infrastructure. That's what gives it it's trust, it's power, and it's value.

So it looks like that it is entirely possible that miners will demonstrate their ability to force change in the protocol. 
As I've previously posted, those who want to preserve the deflationary nature of Bitcoin better hope the miners don't consider changing the reward schedule and increasing the theoretical cap of 21m. 
This IS now a possibility. Miners who don't hodl can easily convince themselves they will profit from this. As I've stated before if they increased the cap to 210m, it is conceivable that the price wouldn't drop to less than 10% of current prices. This would INCREASE the overall market cap.
Hoarders / hodlers would be - literally - decimated. 
Miners would profit. 
Speculators would be hit, but arguably would find opportunities in the inevitable re-rally in the price (as happens with a stock split). 
Merchants would be meh. PSPs would be meh. 
The impossible is now possible, gentlemen.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:27:22

Holders don't make the rules, miners and nodes do. 
If Bitcoin became a widely used method for payments via PSPs then the PSPs would wield a lot of power. All it takes is them to work together with a quorum of miners on a protocol change and declare it to be "Bitcoin". This forum and many more like it would erupt in anger but the wider public would not. 
There is no reason why this wouldn't work; the only people who lose would be hoarders/holders and speculators. 
Let's say the announce a new cap of 210m to take effect one week from now using a new halving schedule. First thing to happen would be a large sell off, dropping the price. Next thing a group of holders and devs and miners would refuse to budge and maintain their loyalty to the old protocol. Once the sell-off ended and price re-stabilised at something greater than 1/10th the previous price, the miners would start to defect to the new fork as they realised that the old fork was worthless. Merchants working outside the PSPs would switch or risk accepting worthless coins. 
The dust would settle and the holders and speculators would gnash their teeth and complain but ultimately commerce and adoption will have marginalised them completely.  
If you think there is no good reason for this to happen then you are mistaken;
- total market cap would most likely increase; a big net gain for miners long-term 
- large merchants would be on board beforehand, as large merchants use PSPs
- average non-holding user would not lose out much 
- sell offs don't kill the protocol

So many people misunderstand this. Consensus is not required before deploying and propagating a change. Why? Because it is impossible in a trustless p2p system. 
All this talk of pre-fork agreement is damaging Bitcoin. In fact the lack of hard forks to date has damaged Bitcoin. We should have regular forking that all participants are used to dealing with it, rather than it being treated like a black-swan sky-is-falling event.

I've spent a lot of time looking into methods for applying subscriptions to push stored value payment methods (like crypto, paysafecard, and others). 
Ultimately it requires a trusted service to know "send money if available, don't send if not, don't lock up my money, keep doing this forever". 
From a merchants point of view they don't provide the same value as a primary funding method (debit on bank account or credit card). They just don't have the same cancellation attrition. If walking-around hot wallets become commonplace, then the problem isn't so serious for small value subs (Netflix, hosting, Graze, storage) but merchants won't switch until they see similar retention rates to cards and direct debit.

The point of consensus is not to reach agreement before the fork, but to do the fork and let consensus happen afterward as users flock to their preferred chain.

Well, I was thinking that as well as lucky blocks he could also get a crazy mining fee. 
Anyway to answer your question;
The fastest GPU rig does about 2500 mh
The network is currently 400m gh 
That makes the chance of a PC rig finding the next block at about one in 160 million. 
(2,500 in 400,000,000,000)

Block size is no longer a technical challenge, but a human challenge. A test of the concept of consensus. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:36:42
But a split forces actors (merchants, users, miners, nodes) to choose a side where their own interests are best served. This is consensus. If the smaller chain wants to continue for some specific reason, then we have two chains and two coins. I am sure some would call their smaller chain the "real" bitcoin (and maybe they are right!) but the reality is that the economy will most likely follow the longest chain, and will call it Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 07:51:24
I don't necessarily agree. 
If we 10x rewards from midnight 1st December (so block rewards are 250, then 125, etc) then the total lifetime cap will hit 154m or so. 
The price will immediately drop but I don't believe it will drop to less than 10% of current price, as the darknet markets would still be transacting to keep their businesses afloat. 
This means miners would potentially GAIN by doing this, as the block rewards would be higher in dollar terms. Arguably the lower per-Bitcoin price would attract new speculators. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:35:44
Agreed.

Mostly made out of coal.

No consensus afterward means two chains. It means two groups of actors have felt in their own best interests to keep two chains. And that's ok, right?

I believe that we are less than 12 months, and probably less than 6, from one of the major players in the merchant processing market announcing either shutdown (Buttercoin style) or restructure (i.e. layoffs, firesale).

Holding cash is not good economically. Much better to put it to work investing (apart from rainy day money etc). But your point is still valid. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 07:24:09
They believe they represent consensus; in fact to me it seems they think they define consensus. 
They've fixated on the idea that Bitcoin is ultimately a vehicle for decentralised transmission of value, not a day-to-day payment network. 
The issue is that many others in the economy (including some merchants, users, holders, hoarders, psps, service providers) want to expand the day to day usability of the network. 
I've come to appreciate the core devs perspective more over the last few months; however the methods they use to protect their own worldview are very - ahem - libertarian. 
Gavin and Mike's approach of "we think this is better, here it is, use it if you like" is exactly what was intended by Satoshi in the Whitepaper. 
Consensus is post-fork adoption not pre-fork discussion.

The Bitcoin network expends a lot of processing power (not just mining, but relaying between nodes etc) for very little output (transactions per second). By design. 
It is NOT a good model for a computer system. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:27:31
I want Bitcoin, but these bullshit soft forks and talking shops are not consensus building. Just ship it, and let consensus decide. The economics will push the miners and third parties to the "best" chain and your precious goddamn USD price-per-coin will be safe.

Bitcoin is always "almost" at the moon. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:58:39
Exactly. Ten years ago a table was 60% losing players. Today, it's 5-10% at best. This is because of the massive increase in multi-table grinders using coaching and videos and other tools trying to eke out a living. 
As the ratio gets worse and worse, the grinders look for the sites to "do something"... reduce rake, increase VIP benefits, wave a magic wand. 
The sites are feeling the pinch from giving out these benefits and spending more and more to attract new players. Now the sites are all reducing VIP benefits (the largest site being the last to do this in recent weeks) and the suggested solution is move to another site or create a new site that's pro-friendly.
Good luck in finding a site with a large population of losing players that allows mediocre grinders to win.

I'm a big fan of Bitcoin technology and the trustless payment infrastructure it promises. 
I've worked with Bitcoin alongside other payment technologies, and creative uses of the blockchain and the currency. 
However the two things in r/Bitcoin I dislike are (A) the unthinking bias of some posters for and against individuals, companies, altcoins, etc. Extreme views are the calling card of the person who prefers not to think for themselves. (B) the specific belief that Bitcoin is currently viable as a mass payment system and is better and cheaper than the legacy systems. This is completely misguided but somewhat understandable for those in the US where payment tech is way behind Europe. Thankfully this particular issue is reducing as the core dev group have made people realise that the future of the tech is as a settlement mechanism, with trustlessness as the real USP not scalability. 
So it's fun to poke fun, and actually productive too.

My point was they are not super useful on their own. Certainly usable for illicit stuff, but not on a huge scale.

Log is not inherently better or worse, just different, depending on purpose. 
10-100 is different from 100-1000 in one important way; the first requires a way smaller investment (in fiat) than the second. 
That is especially relevant to Bitcoin which is subject to daily sales pressure from mining (unlike comparable tradable assets).

There's nothing stopping an exchange or payment processor going fractional.

You can get a vanilla MasterCard in any gas station. One of the most popular in Canada for online purchases. 
Oh... but will bet 100 Canadian that they don't work with spendbt

It would actually be pretty hard for anyone outside a very small group of people to do this at Sony. 
And certainly not anonymously. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:54:17
And almost nobody is spending it. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:00:39
Understood. I'm just spreading info here as I have a fair bit of expertise in both also.

Give me the country that the person who showed it to you works in. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:48:31
Varies dramatically by country, also depends on the business line. 
Also large companies pay a lot less than small ones.

You are using the 1% fallacy. 
"if our product had 1% of the market, it'd sell X units / be worth Y"
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:04:38
The legal situation in Canada has certainly been hard - would it be cool if we could just use our debit cards or interac? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:06:28
Are you saying unprofitable companies are worth nothing? That's silly. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:29:14
So your solutions are 
1. Things that aren't Bitcoin
2. Things that aren't really invented yet

Yep me too.

Brute forcing a CC is not hard. It's just trying the various combinations on the card networks IS hard. What you are proposing won't work for that reason.
Bitcoin - in that and other respects - is a lot more inherently secure. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:12:22
By getting the private key from somewhere.

" I see no reason why they wouldn't allow US players."
Just like that? I believe you are wrong; no chance Bitcoin re-opens any international licences poker site to US. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:56:05
This is not "fiat" just a specific implementation of fiat. Don't confuse implementation with protocol. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:59:34
It also happens to be the most commonly recommended implementation of Bitcoin, except Bitcoiners suggest "paper" not the more resilient linen blend used here. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 10:59:46
Outside of holders and investors, I would say less than 10k people per week spend Bitcoin in a retain (online or in person) fashion.

In the US. Chip and Pin obviates this in the part of the world with proper credit card 2FA systems (ie all of the developed world outside North America). 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:01:34
He can't even predict the present. Amazon does not pay 3% for credit cards. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:08:46
5% is a pretty good number, and a lot higher than I predicted. Interesting, and positive for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:58:44
A fair point if that's what you want to illustrate, over the lifetime of the asset. 
If you wanted to show 1 year of price changes, or any other short period, log scale is misleading. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 14:31:21
Just contact Paul Ryan directly and ask him.

They are ponzis
They pay some people who get in early with later people's deposits. So there will be some people out there who double their coin. Then they stop paying. 
The theory here is that people try a small amount and once it works, try a larger amount. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:48:56
UK debit cards can cost a lot less than that FFS. He’s probably including the 10/15% fee he pays uber or mytaxi for hailing. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 08:02:53
That's not true. Plenty of bank transfers are push. You can push with PayPal. Push is not a magic unique property of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:39:53
I think it's BS. 
The issues facing a regulated poker site accepting Bitcoin are massive. 
Although I've been wrong before, I'd probably bet it's a good while away yet.

They don't have just one licence, they have about a dozen each with their own restrictions. If you've read the law on gaming in Isle of Man or Malta or any of the big gaming territories, deposits ARE a concern, but as you correctly say most focus is on cash out as presumably they are much less frequent (!) 
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:04:38
ACH in the US is about 20 years out of date. 
No verification, no validation. 
It's only power is the fact that it's ubiquitous and easy to process. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:26:10
Actually the Bitcoin protocol currently in use is one of many variants (we've had hard forks, we just happen to call one of them "the" Bitcoin block chain).
Bitcoin is not the bottom layer. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:39:19
I'm bullish on the tech. Bearish on the price. 
I work in the payments business, and have spent more time on Bitcoin than most. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:51:00
The main issue is the fact that it could be seen as a way of facilitating deposits and cashout from blocked countries (like the US). 
Anonymous payment methods exist, but believe me are tricky to comply with regulations around them. 
I'm willing to bet they won't launch Bitcoin in Canada this year. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:52:26
Yes. Change Bitcoin so it fits their business model. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:07:21
It's absolutely horrible % for even a new payment method. 
I've worked with niche payment methods that have gone from "an idea in a guys head" to 1m+ per month in under a year. Niche market. Niche countries. 
Why are they successful? Because they solve an actual problem for a potential consumer. Bitcoin does not solve any consumer level problems except for anonymity, hence is relevant only in darkmarkets. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:53:33
Your assumption is invalid. Horribly invalid. Look at the big markets (UK, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Germany, Russia) and there are a Zillion options.

In the US, online payments are expensive. 
In the rest of the world, they are not. $0.25 would be horribly expensive for a EU debit card or bank transfer. 
I've done the math for my business, and the case isn't there.

"Well everyone tells each other to spend them"
Succinctly put.

Well then you have the wrong apps, or are in the wrong country, or are using the wrong store. I had this exact same thing happen to me (lost wallet, not card impairment) in Toys R Us in Atlantic City. The clerk told me I could use my paypal account, or use my card using the touchscreen. In the end I remembered I had my NFC watch on (watch2pay) which allowed me to make a contactless card payment to buy the Team Umizoomi car.

There's no way New York can unilaterally shut down an online initiative located outside the state just because some of it's users are based in NY. 
Oh wait; 
Massive companies, based in Europe, with solid legal opinion, and a relatively small number of NY customers. Shut down over 2 years ago, forced to leave US.
