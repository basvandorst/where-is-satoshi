@_date: 2016-04-13 18:14:16

@_date: 2016-04-23 00:40:02

@_date: 2018-09-08 03:46:44

how can u connect to that?
@_date: 2018-09-28 18:25:17

how do you fund ur account? just regular bank transfer or is there multiple ways to fund ur indodax account.
thanks in advance for info
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:47:05
oh i see. so how does the device get internet? is there Ethernet cable?
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:50:43
For sure, it may take 3-6 months, sorry we can't give a more solid timeline.
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:39:22
taste of things to come
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:17:51
please do. can you do the pdf and video now? or you need the parts?
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:55:18
that was one of the best intro to bitcoin ive seen.
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:53:59
nice. wish u luck.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:43:15
that was gentlemen
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:02:52
We do plan on doing this at some point. Right now Korea and US are where most of our users are.
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:28:29
haha nice
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:50:47
yeah i love this. can you let me know how you set this up?
i dont have a lot of time to set up a new device nor am i a very technical person.
let me know the details and ill be glad to pay in BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:32:16
super cool. any plans to sell these?
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:19:26
for sure losers
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:08:16
people are just over reacting in case. this way they can buy back lower.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:42:41
i laughed at that. someones smart idea at google to write that.
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:16:41
yeah, of course people are gona pick gold. give bitcoin another few years :):)
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:35:46
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:17:09
exactly. all the while Australia gives up another opportunity to diversify there economy 
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:58:11
yeah he asked a pretty loaded question and interrupted him
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:08:37
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:42:40
nice. its also a pretty cool song too.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:32:53
they r going to make this profit! just u watch!
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:18:43
man... that so looks like mark of beast stuff...
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:26:04
good news
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:13:01
Patrick Byrne is becoming a legend.
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:40:21
fark pretty high.... but here in australia we pay 2%...
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:48:15
bitcoin code has soo much use. keep the ideas flowing!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:15:07
good luck
@_date: 2014-08-27 05:06:40
yeah that is good advice.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:01:00
please share
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:37:01
cheers mofo
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:10:11
holy crap. fiverr is not huge but still well known.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:12:34
 watched the ads before and i dont get why they are good. anyone understand why they r any good?
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:11:45
so? private wealth does that mean everyones money? and one time levy wtf is levy man!
@_date: 2014-09-03 04:53:38
youtube now steals the video makers money
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:48:16
come to think of it. maybe u r right.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:07:51
wow just had a look at BitVC.com so far i like what i see, nice interface and responsive.
anyone tried to interest account yet??
@_date: 2014-09-13 05:34:28
i feel like they ask stupid questions because majority of people have that question in mind.
@_date: 2014-10-17 03:49:06
wow seems like a risky ass move, i hope this works out long term.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:12:02
so whats the real reason you could not speak?
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:24:02
just keep pushing the fact that its a new protocal like email, bitorrent or http/tcp for money.
its a matter of fact now. say that its growing like as fast as facebook and saving people LOTS of money.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:32:27
haha, he slipped a bitcoin mention at the end.
fix the banks/financial systems first then we fix politics and goverment then we win
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:16:20
holy shit did u guys hear his prediction at the end. rather interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:29:54
honestly i dont think its as much as what people are saying.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:53:43
lol nice
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:56:58
well said
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:05:40
well if buy out happens this guy will be active on it 
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:45:06
they should stop being so scared and just roll out btc ticket buys. ill need a ticket soon.
@_date: 2014-07-10 10:37:06
LOL! thats how this sub feels sometimes.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:01:46
what a suprise
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:04:16
dude just buy some bitcoins and sit on them for awhile. its only 5 years old still plenty of time for it to grow.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:04:50
no worries man. just put in what u can logically afford to loss and see how u feel after awhile.
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:41:01
lol true
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:25:10
USA is fucking insane u know they control everything. especially finance. USD after all is the world currency.
but back to this topic, it is very very plausible this is just a scam on mark behalf.
but i want to note i still believe the gov story more so.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:46:31
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:19:46
if u making this much its not that big of a deal u can afford it. its not really late, its like saying boy the internet is old at 5 years old.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:01:56
cleaver ad
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:01:59
maybe dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:16:55
look interesting. would like a took like this.
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:41:03
good point.
the road is clearer now.
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:46:22
haha, yeah after maxcoin fail i doubt more than ever he invented bitcoin.
then again he was super early on in adopting it and not afraid to pump it on air.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:21:03
RemindMe! 11 days "wtf happened to Tom Butterfield?"
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:12:03
i agree that the bitcoin mining system is getting out of hand.
i dont understand fully how this bitshares work but the general concept sounds interesting.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:52:33
just watched that video the otherday. this btc thing is everywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:16:07
im coming after ya
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:46:06
really good stuff. this could be great for digital currencies as a whole.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:18:15
i agree. im just worried this coin is going to be worthless and so i think its important to drive the points of how this coin can gain more value. I dont fully understand how mastercoins work but they seem to offer a lot of options.
you did mention how people could contribute premined coins to goxcoin and would be a interesting way of distributing a new coin certainly.
u say there are more reasons why this is a good idea, id like to know them all. this idea has to be sold to the users that lost 500 million, thats a tough sell.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:00:41
id like it sticked to the top. some might ignore it but its cleaner this way.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:05:50
@_date: 2014-08-21 12:23:12
if a guy who runs a mining business cant even imagine difficulty going up then how can anyone predict price.
looking at you TA mofos.
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:52:56
good work, looks useful. small things count man.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:11:57
cant believe blockchain has got this far without being funded. freaking love the site, use it all the time.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:25:45
sure is. that is the origin of the name!
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:15:13
next step, actual mention of of btc.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:42:50
maybe a good question is: how long did it take for the internet to really catch on in the minds of people? i know for a fact even when i had the internet for a few years it still took me awhile to really grasp the power of it.
@_date: 2014-05-24 11:02:15
so roger is gay? or was the hacker trolling further?
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:40:30
doesnt look real. looks shopped to me. those stuff stuck on to the board dont look right.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:09:54
well i hope so for the sake of people that got scammed. they r probably looking back like its a mtgox moment. u need to implement a punishment fee so people have no way to scam.
there was recent development in this type of escrow where people put a part forward and if they scam they loss a significant amount of money.
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:57:22
this seems to happen a lot. once you research bitcoin enough you start to appreciate it despite price.
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:45:23
exactly, i went and had a look at coinjelly. hardly any info and u cant even sell/buy yet.
need more SOLID proof and facts, before pushing this stuff publicly.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:51:03
so if they keep using bitcoin for a year they could possibly make 90million at this rate.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:45:46
is this done already or what. all i see is offline. come on!!!!!
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:17:48
thats my fav shirt!
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:02:59
dont forget to add paypal in there somewhere!
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:55:28
yeah u say that but u probably dont live in cyprus or the money other countries. your money is getting stolen from you without you knowing through money printing and adjust met of bank interest rates.
bitcoin just takes time to get used to.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:42:58
i think bitcoin would be convenient for people that would like to watch 1 film once in a blue moon but dont want to go through subscribing and giving out details.
bitcoin is pretty much perfect for small transactions (because there is hardly a fee) and the speed of bitcoin could pretty much feed the impulse of sex perfectly here.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:47:24
exactly !
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:49:57
bad luck man! u will get it back one way or another.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:46:27
na u can spend them. as the prices rises bitcoin gets spent.
@_date: 2014-02-21 11:25:56
that guy is part of history
@_date: 2015-12-05 09:31:23
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:50:42
nice quick vid. cheers.
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:50:07
"the central point of something, typically a difficult or unpleasant situation"
it says 'typically' so not in all cases. ive seen the word used for the center of stuff.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:46:33
we also cant pretend gox has zero value. it largely propelled bitcoin to where it is now.
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:14:09
keep hitting this horse hard...
@_date: 2014-07-15 09:41:29
well done!
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:28:44
another scam?
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:38:30
dear god bitcoin is surveillance coin. we need it to be private for real.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:45:49
annnnnnnnddd the price of mtgox is going up
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:55:31
im open to this idea. keep working on it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 15:55:24
i disagree i still think the people that actually try to understand it and hate it are tiny. most people dont put in the time to understand it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:30:41
i cant fking believe that the desert like coffee is for real. cant say i know that about my goxbtc...
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:13:23
i thought lithuania was suppose to be pretty cluey with the netm software and technology
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:24:02
what is the source of where people suicided over this
@_date: 2014-02-03 15:44:27
its a little hard to understand because i dont know programming but it does feels like the way to go.
decentralize everything!
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:16:44
100% agree. this whole situation is really awesome in the sense that it will show how powerful the blockchain is.
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:33:36
come to think of it cars do sit unused a lot of the time. would be brilliant if the car u bought could pay itself off by acting as a taxi during off times.
what other high cost things can be automated to pay itself off?
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:38:50
wat r u on about. r u targeting dogecoin here?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:47:05
yeah i think so too. im even afraid to say it now.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:11:25
got to be the dumbest thing i read from such a advanced country: "It’s also not a payment instrument, because the law stipulates that a payment instrument must have an issuer responsible for its operation”
get with the times.
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:06:44
lol yes. do they still use children for work?
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:39:57
noticed this a few months back, might have to get a few friends to migrate.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:48:54
but more than if it was falling
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:02:16
suppose to be support here but people just keep bashing people for losing on gox. great support... great community.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:03:09
i think its very important the fee remain competitive. but also adding new exchange features would give new incentive to trade again and even bring in new traders. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:28:14
this is gentleman... that is brilliant 
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:25:45
there bloody well should be an incentive to run a full node. this will be a good example of bitcoins being used in file sharing and for running tor networks.
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:44:56
cool calm collected
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:51:56
what r u ignorant in?
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:57:58
its amazing
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:48:58
are LMAX big?
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:41:48
what what was there reaction. far as i know the fed is evil.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:36:23
double-dipping! exactly. what r they thinking making it out that they are difference entities 
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:48:21
interesting that its canberra. would of liked to see it used in melb syd or any other populated town.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:38:44
true. but i have to admit for some stores this might actually look pretty cool.
price in BTC looks very futuristic.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:13:11
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:36:51
u can get interest at bitvc.com
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:40:08
thats what i say now
@_date: 2014-02-21 11:29:31
but what is your stance on doge?
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:26:48
shaking my head in disbelief.
good for him.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:31:53
how dare u start with bla bla.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:03:16
what is this???
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:06:21
haha, i dont know about that. im starting to think that dogecoin will be the next best option due to the network.
mind you litecoin would logically be next being a little faster and different mining system and relatively large market.
wat the other alts dont have though is a community that actually enjoys using the currency, only dogecoin has this.
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:31:33
these big companies sometimes move too slow.
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:20:04
dude if u look at the chart long term it looks fine
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:20:41
time to buy some ron paul coin
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:48:15
 Stellars forces you to use facebook, this is really really of putting.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:32:29
should do one about blackcoin and how its mining other coins and selling them for blackcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:28:47
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:20:24
what about pantless guys?
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:38:19
Hard to tell if he even has firm information.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:23:57
cant find the rates, fees and all that hidden bs. where is the transparency? edit: some info in FAQ.
What about the fees for the debit card and upfront cost. i wana know this stuff..
wtf. tried to sign up twice now and each time it asks me for a 2 fac on log in before i even set one up. cant even sign in once.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:10:05
i have to say the design and the photography look a little sinister
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:47:46
wow guys im just asking, i read the whole thing and was just curious. so sensitive in here.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:18:06
yes! this is a good idea.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:11:58
thank u
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:58:54
this looks really nice.
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:42:12
despite all the doubt about the exchange it is still running and still earning interest. It has plans to ad more coins such as dogecoin.
From my experience it trades much faster and smoother than cryptsy.
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:50:44
is this new? think ive seen this ages ago?
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:50:55
am i reading this right. it has a count down. does this mean it is live or wat?
please explain.
@_date: 2014-07-17 05:43:13
screw u dude.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:07:30
this blockstream, boy! they have an insane amount of smart people on the team.
@_date: 2014-09-10 02:23:02
exactly, unless apply makes a super cheap phone this applepay isnt standing out to me yet.
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:57:24
lol! took him awhile didnt it. i remember when he was bashing it and speculating max kaiser invented it.
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:40:14
sounds interesting. i would like to see pictures and location!
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:41:47
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:14:39
i used to think coinjar but recently found out that zhao tong is running it. unfortunately there isnt much choice in australia.
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:08:53
didnt see that but man that looks wild...so u would like to do this kind of stuff?
@_date: 2014-01-14 10:59:46
give me a break dude
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:31:44
How likely is it that the exchange will continue to run to recoup losses?
Is it likely that Mt.Gox will be bought out in some fashion?
Can we force Mark to give real facts and details through the courts?
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:46:12
lol cheers...
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:40:55
does look interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:35:41
i know the manager too! can confirm.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:51:35
not so bad then. i was under the impression it was real big problem. people keep bringing up scalability way to often.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:10:09
remind me! 5 days "real_federales claims worked in fed"
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:41:05
cool idea indeed!
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:45:20
interesting. seem a lot of people want to buy goxbtc
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:25:24
thank u
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:12:52
whats the catch? fees and exchange rates no doubt
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:10:36
LOL brilliant
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:20:00
usa still rules the world. specially in japan they are like buddies since the ww2.
when it comes to money usa is still number 1.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:26:11
gogogogo develop it NOW!
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:31:06
bali really suits biting
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:56:26
seems awfully fast then setting them up.
when you suggested they accept btc did you also mention bitpay?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:56:21
this is wrong from my own experience when the price is falling i hold on tighter.
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:56:05
control f and no mention of bitcoin. felt a tinge of disappointment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:09:22
well do u remember a few weeks ago if u had just 1.3 btc?
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:51:50
thats it
@_date: 2014-10-14 10:00:45
yeah, i know they are everywhere! was there for a year, ended up going to family mart more often than 7/11 by chance.
still cant believe it, going to get a friend test this out.
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:55:03
powerful stuff in part 2.
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:03:20
where is that from?

australian internet cant stream, upload is hardly ever a megs worth.
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:14:02
looks sick.
im afraid this kind of mining will be history not too long from now.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:53:58
cheers, interesting location. it looked almost part of the environment. im guessing people cant access it 24h a day
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:42:52
well in chat he even said something along the lines of “well, technically speaking it's not 'lost' just yet, just temporarily unavailable.” meaning he knows where they are but cant access them for watever reason

it appears good for people that dont have the knowledge or the time to obtain real bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-13 11:49:36
that is a great video. it would can target the gamer market pretty well.
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:33:34
is it a good article?
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:31:07
my experience is bitpay is instant, as a buyer that is.
@_date: 2014-09-16 04:59:20
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:41:50
its just utter hypocrisy. they advocate 'be different' and blatantly strangle true unique innovation. more like 'be nazi'.
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:16:58

if u can log in tell me cause when i try to it ask for 2 fac before i even have one.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:40:52
freaking awesome. could this be in anyway practical and useful? could you have a song linked to bitcoin in someway...
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:29:32
kidding me. i just bought some not long ago. coinjar price is freaking bs.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:50:55
can we please upvote this and get eyes on it. we need to change the tone here and get things worked out.
edit: holy shit i just realized this is one day old. i feel like this should be front page... are people down voting this?
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:45:47
shut up u mouth. then u win.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:22:37
yes, why only now.
edit: not saying this is true but we need more proof.
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:34:07
dont let others discourage you, if you are safe to do this you should do it. you got to go with your gut.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:24:32
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:25:50
wow interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:59:23
guys nerds will be nerds and i feel like mark is a big nerd. they dont communicate well and like to show everyone up and prove people wrong. i feel like the turning point really could be mtgox being sold off to hopefully a more competent party/team.
honestly if mark has been reading anything on reddit he is probably over it by now and like screw it! i want out.
i just hope there is some light at the end of the tunnel here. 
nerds will be nerds.
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:59:16
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:01:15
thought so but didnt seem that obvious or that particularly interesting. some guy was saying it was such a good campaign, but im not seeing it.
@_date: 2014-01-18 15:17:22
im really upset about this. i thought bitcoiners were much more layed back about meetups...
come on coinjar drop a little more...
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:22:25
DUDE 16% is soo low
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:01:53
calling what do you think of this?
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:38:38
interesting idea. 2nd being more important than first.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:01:26
lol man... hope u learnt something today
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:06:57
agree fully.
ive gotten used to using bitcoin to tip, donate and pay for things. i cant wait for really well made torrent tipping system rewarding uploaders and seeders alike.
in this case not sure if it is greed on the part of the creators or some contract issue with vemo not allowing other avenues for a period of time.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:24:05
screw u man, take my downvote on me.

@_date: 2014-10-13 06:53:37
Bitfury is getting a lot of attention it seems. they are working with digitalBTC an Australian company but it is not clear what the relationship is.
anyone clued in on this?
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:11:22
you could day trade using this? lock when things looking bad and unlock when things looking up.
@_date: 2014-05-07 09:50:50
imagine it going to 262 or 75. its just too odd for that to happen with all the news and awareness of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:43:19
to bad  u have to order 10 and only in US
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:29:37

this is cool thanks for link.
germany is a btc epicenter
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:04:05
 &lt; take a look maybe u can find something you can do.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:53:37
this should be an option. alternatively if u want to change your default address there is a grace period and the owner is obviously warned in email or sms.
thanks for sharing this. simple but good.
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:59:00
wow no kidding. i felt like they cut him short there though.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:11:26

they love talking about it cause it gets viewers. thats ok keep going bloomberg.

@_date: 2014-03-03 20:31:16
the story isnt finished yet. there is an investigation on what happened and they are looking in to all the transactions.
the law is getting in invovled now and there are lots of people sueing gox.
you can join irc at  and 
you can also sign this 
and join in on a case in the future.
this might be a long and drawn out thing but peope are going to be talking about this like it or not on bitcoin for a long fucking time.
i dont know how much we will get back. honestly there isnt even a reasonable explanation thus far on where these bitcoin are, we need to answer this first.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:24:21
'can't be evil'
Brilliant line.

hope all the best with the business. seen it awhile back and it is pretty desirable product.

cheers, ill keep this in mind.
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:07:50

hope something solid comes out soon!

welcome to the party mofo.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:40:28
i feel the btc community has been less and less coordinated, so this could be an important opportunity to strengthen bitcoin at the very core.
i hope mark reads this and we least attempt to work things out.
@_date: 2014-09-18 07:16:18
that btc logo needs work, should have a hairline boarder around it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:13:00
thats a pretty massive cut on fees! looks like a good sign to me.

she is so distracting.
@_date: 2014-01-29 09:04:16
shame on u asian guy. get out of the way! future is coming through.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:49:48
i agree. bitcoin users would value this more than usual. i dont see why it isnt more common place here amongst exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:50:45
where is your address: sent a milli
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:41:43

im real butt hurt these days. come on btc give me a break.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:55:54
mbtc is better imo. ive switched a lot of my accounts to it and it reads better.
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:39:27
good! hope something comes from this.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:07:43
RemindMe! 6 months

they said their motto is 'cant be evil' can only hope.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:19:33
lol this should have a news article...
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:17:52
thanks... im still working out how to send change back. the old tipper was way easier.
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:57:32
who is this guy talking? never seen him before.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:21:30
i feel like we need to run this ad again. get this serious bitcoin vibe out of the air.
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:36:15
sell the damn thing to him right now!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:27:15

@_date: 2014-01-30 14:56:24
the idea you can do capitalism without risk is ridiculous!
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:07:54
chance for Tim Draper to dollar cost average down.
@_date: 2014-08-26 20:55:39
thats what i thought but it seems some of these big companies are not taking full advantage of bitcoin and going half arsed. i dont see any risk to them.
i think only dell was brave enough to go international.
Expedia really should be the one to take advantage bitcoin with air tickets.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:11:25
@_date: 2014-01-25 07:33:36
doesnt matter if dogecoin is successful so will bitcoin. if bitcoin gains further traction so will the dogecoin.
no need to worry me my friends its all connected.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:29:55
as a graphic designer coinbase website scale and proportions are to large.
text and font lay out looks too loss, probably would look better tighter.
i dont use coinbase because its only for yanks
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:37:19
it is a fallacy. we have been been through this so many times on reddit and bitcointalk.
for the love of god when the price goes up there is always people spending bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:31:01
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:53:19
lol thats what i thought.
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:38:33
coinjar seems even worse cause its only australian on top of that it is like a prepaid card and i suspect even heavier fees then xapo.
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:45:15
is this for real? i see the systems going for 50 dollars. i thought these would be rather rare by now.
i remember seeing on ebay orginal NES and sega megadrives going for over 250-300 bucks.
what gives?
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:14:20
how does the thumbnail work, seems pretty random to me and if so that should be changed.
@_date: 2014-01-18 10:06:43
lol. this is probably truth.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:46:04
omg the mtgox bounty is soo low its SAD!
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:57:54
last i checked they wanted bitcoins all to be traceable. they wanted to make some coins tainted and bad and some clean, this would really screw bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:05:49
cheers ill have a look
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:59:55
i thought the whole idea was group funding. i guess its just started out. ill be watching it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:43:08
yeah looks alright but the fees are high as
@_date: 2014-10-12 13:39:14
does feel pretty fair to buy now.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:17:52
yeah, exactly. it also ended on a good note!
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:31:58
get this fucking done now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:43:00
i love this. if only if i was a writer i would so use your service. how about colour and graphic? how much would that cost to make?
i do graphic design and would be cool to do a art/design book.
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:31:31
crono yeah because i think there was a limit on characters u can use and that is how they shortened it.
@_date: 2014-01-30 10:19:20
LINK NOW!! where is it
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:03:14
lol that guy in the background disagrees!!!!!

amazon. too big and too slow to make any moves these days.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:40:56
was looking at that today and it is interesting to see such a long depression. im used to it now but what a painful year...
iam still concerned because this bounce is really weak and making me unconfidence, i suspect others feel this way too.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:59:02
nice illustrations
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:35:33
i think you're right.
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:02:39
holy shit i remember watching this. a year already ... :(
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:25:16
:) its coinjar... its just coins in the change jar for them.
give a little back with 2% fee o boy.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:33:56
ahh i see. just didnt seem that good of an ad to me but if its working like that.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:29:04
most people use windows so we need that out quickly so we can test it.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:09:55
nope. pretty disappointing.

@_date: 2014-03-23 07:04:46
there is no evidence that they have obtained personal info
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:39:03
would like one of these cheap smart phones to test out.
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:53:27
boy i love the sound of that machine! it sure is a beautiful mix of old and new technology. not to mention the lighting! i kind of want one.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:16:26
i find it funny this has not been addressed. should be a public move to clear this past event clearer. i had to dig through so many old threads to get some of this info.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:46:00
interesting product 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:12:15
cheers for links. i belive the bitcoinmarkets one isnt a suicide though. the other our unconfirmed but certainly possible. :(
@_date: 2014-08-26 20:56:27
wow what a deal!

log it please
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:20:57
cya man
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:55:59
i realize its necessary step. i still wonder really what is the figure on the bitcoin to fiat conversation that is weighing down the price due to merchants, i guess bitpay would have the best figure.
on top of merchents is the constant mining of bitcoin always been sold.
i wonder how much business dish is doing in btc that could be a massive draw down on btc price. in fact this is probably the most negative sell pressure on btc to date.
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:17:57
to the moon?
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:29:19
look trust me. watch dogecoin and it wont go away. it fills a much needed market, noobs, younger kids and well the fun of the internet.
take a look at the dogecoin reddit thread and u will see that it is growing really fast.
if i had a good computer i would be mining it but the fact is i dont. so i just bought some instead.
watch it grow my friend.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:53:47
can someone read this and sum it up
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:40:51
ah i see. was it the french one?
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:37:01
holy shit. thanks for this info...
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:06:07
is tigerdirect a USA thing? never really heard of it?
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:27:53
so does this mean 2 people have to be using greenadress.it?
im trying to understand, if i have this greenaddress.it/multi sig wallet or whatever it is and send bitcoin to anyone will that bypass the 3 confirmation.
so far it seems the 10 minutes wait time can only be broken in a closed ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-01-21 13:05:21
only took 5 years to figure out. duh....... real life.... digital? matters???
@_date: 2014-06-14 07:46:59
its yahoo. some of the worst comments on the subject of bitcoin is read there.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:06:07
hmm badluck!
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:12:13
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:06:46
yeah thats why if u are creative with your business u can think of otherways of making profit. many people r going to be on the site because there is no fees so u got much users to profit from.
im suprised no western exchanges even attempt this. bit revealing.
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:32:50
purse.io seems interesting. but i cant help but feel the person using dollars to buy the item is getting ripped?
@_date: 2014-10-17 11:06:08
haha this is happening now!!
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:32:57
this is pretty interesting to see this old timer talk about bitcoin like this. verge getting a little better on reportin.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:14:57
shit i wish i knew this before
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:01:23
i dont know. its all speculation. no one knows how much they are really in debt. maybe they lost a lot buy maybe it wasnt in the 100ks....
they are after all the most well know entity in bitcoin. they have the biggest amount of traders accounts and they are well known. maybe some party wants to have a crack at it.
@_date: 2014-07-15 17:40:56
we did it!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:25:20
yeah this is a good idea.
@_date: 2014-08-26 11:45:14
as for the recording everything part wouldnt the payment processor you use record all the details if you maybe need it?
that is the advantages of using a processor or a bitcoin webwallet. all is recorded for you.
i doubt the accuracy is a big deal unless you are transacting large amounts in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:50:03
didnt work :(
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:55:36
still a good chance google will do what apple does. i mean after all they made google wallet and google loves to win at everything.
@_date: 2014-08-22 11:48:23
truth right here. 
was checking out the chinese exchanges and man they r surprisingly good.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:30:26
ah come on. the fact he was supporting bitcoin before anyone is pretty good foresight from him
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:00:31
dont send to bitstamp send to an australian exchange
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:01:59
nice chart
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:41:37
get fucked thats fud. the keys are held ransom is more likely the story. mark cant simply despair.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:10:03
LOL exactly! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:37:44
actually think its a good name. good play i say.
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:09:17
we need better examples for robots using bitcoin.
so far its the same stuff: taxi robot service and home electronic self maintenance.
drones would be the most interesting use case. the drone delivery business is taking off.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:44:50
i see, thanks.
i likely is it that bitocean will out bid sunlot u think?
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:31:49
well it seems america has almost everything.
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:04:02
well doesnt a lot of things start in the west anyway. just a matter of time.
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:54:19
kind of worried some big church is going to say mark of the beast at some point.
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:59:34
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:31:08
this is well made...
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:10:46
fark.. thats interesting information.
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:29:54
thanks for sharing and doing this interview. i always wondered about fidor bank.
@_date: 2014-10-01 11:56:14
bitcoin is already so closely tied to reddit, just seems naturally reddit to use bitcoin. duh.
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:38:17
lol do u really have to do this infront of a massive gun that u have to work over.
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:03:02
come on man make something new zhoutong!!!
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:28:37
yeah but u missing the point. that this coin can essentially be speculated on and donated too in different ways. so there are other variables here.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:55:37
i guess a good question is if there is a vote would be be weighed by how much btc u had in gox?
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:31:25
well done
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:39:17
Can i have some color coins?
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:08:58
ah yeah, that would the origins of the pale horse quote.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:05:27
fix your declining dogecoin first. soon fundraising, donating and tipping in dogecoin is going to be practically worthless at this rate.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:01:16
yeah for sure.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:25:52
well keep going! we need more answers here.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:51:14
people are kept busy. chasing time chasing money chasing balance. much easier to misinform people now.
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:21:40
LOL agree.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:15:45
I can do any graphic design work for this non-profit.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:49:27
i have to agree with the mtgox part. the way the community in on this case is disgusting. the only people that seem to care r the ones that lost. ignore the fact that the exchange is down there is so much unknown factors in the event and not enough investigation.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:09:44
this is a off topic question but do you know anything about mtgox deal and what is okcoin wanting to do?
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:34:01
might be unpopular opinion but i like using the decimals.
0.001 looks more futuristic than 10,000. Lower units are a symbol of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:02:19
haha so funny. 13 years later, took long enough.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:31:04
yeah i dont get it. people seem to think if there is no regulation you can act like animals. come on common sense here please.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:50:31
that be true. its been going on for 2 months none stop.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:12:26
this guy loves bitcoin now, i can tell.
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:51:59
kind of dumb not to hire a few guys to give these out too. what if u like men.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:29:07
banks would be moronic to pass it up. tell them to research cyprus germany and england, they have much going on with bitcoin and finance.
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:07:54

@_date: 2014-08-18 19:13:01
yeah i agree with this, ive been trying to DCA all year and its not doing so good. its just a lot less emotional though, buying large amounts of btc can be stressful but my advice to not put in crazy amounts.
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:25:31
LOL i know
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:47:49
haha, good observation

@_date: 2014-02-23 11:03:59
u didnt say it was going up.
@_date: 2014-03-21 06:31:17
yep color work need to be done. otherwise i think its a good idea.
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:00:13
why dont u feed this in to justdice reddit also?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:31:18
wow sounds pretty big right? do they do international business?
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:24:13
wow that quote is beautiful.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:39:50
na to me it sounds like he can access them for watever reason. maybe blocked from the bank that holds the keys.
or its under watch and is frozen. gox has many issues with the law and possibly old SilkRoad money which is bs cause all money seems to link back to drugs.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:59:14

@_date: 2014-10-15 08:27:06
gets me angry just reading all this... dont know what to say, keep reading all this crap plaguing the Bitcoin space...
mintpal and moolah on top of this in recent times.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:16:28
this most likely would be the answer.
by the way your username is from the book, Behold a Pale Horse?
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:59:27
hope this works cause im starting to get a sick of all these new altcoins. u guys see that isrealcoin, are u kidding me now..........
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:39:17

@_date: 2014-03-08 00:51:10
if u have kids u cant do this
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:22:04
u dont even understand.
its human nature to want to spend when they have more to spend. this isnt hard!
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:50:53
makes a lot of sense. explains why there were fuck all people really working at gox. essentially 1-2 guys know what is going on for real.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:08:01
i found one on the daily mail. but i also read somewhere the mother said he had a high IQ in a recent french interview with her. i believe the french source would be the first instance of the info.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:08:08
so far nothing really
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:44:16

@_date: 2014-07-05 18:13:19
good idea
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:20:34
i thought google bought it. man the media sucks.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:42:30
exactly people are betting both ways. its silly that people even criticize people for buying goxcoins when selling goxcoins for goxfiat is the same difference.
@_date: 2014-01-23 14:32:24
need chinese people to confirm this right now!
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:50:50
im disappointed to read this.
@_date: 2014-10-16 06:06:37
isnt this an old video?
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:18:45
people are focused on the word 'money' and paying but i think there is a very high chance that bitcoin will be used for value storage and that something else could be the internet money.
the btc slogan should be more open ended and not focused on the currency money aspect.
these are some i like but certainly might not fit for an official slogan but u get the idea:
to free to fail
free money.
transaction complete.
bitcoins more than money.
bit more than money.
bitcoin currency online.
bitcoin bit faster bit fairer.
bitcoin value online.
bitcoin your bit of value.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:17:21
so chain is an app creating company for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:32:27

@_date: 2014-03-01 19:35:23
i agree. this news report is a bit of a taint on him but u know im suprised i hvent heard it before after all the eyes on him.
i still think its highly unlikely he is trying to pull a massive scam, like u say he cant get away with it.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:14:43
really good artist

would like to see way more easier use of .bit
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:01:15
i for one am interested seeing this play out.
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:30:49

@_date: 2014-07-02 14:57:05
funny i was just reading and brushing up on super.
australian super is such a joke. we should be able to access it whenever. just found out one of my accounts is losing money on fees! the whole idea of super is to gain money and its doing the bloody opposite.
if i had a choice id put it all in gold or bitcoin or even manage it myself in stocks.
superscam more like it.
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:30:33
pretty much.
time flies when you're having fun.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:29:35
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:22:48
ah, still too scared to commit.
question should be "The blockchain, are you a believer?"
bitcoin is a dirty word.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:34:14
thanks for link!
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:04:02
i see. well i hope they dont get stuck in testing.
so much good news recently but nothing solid.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:01:59
lol! what now russia... the news never stops with banks and these ponzi currencies
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:24:30
for a tech merchant they are bloody slow to get on board with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:35:07
the bigger u are the slower u r. amazon needs to loss a bit of weight at make things happen.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:38:10
o yeah lots just forgot about gox. it isnt a finished story fool, there is way too much unexplained. this guy just wants the market.
@_date: 2014-09-14 15:20:15
where can i get one?
@_date: 2014-09-13 05:26:29
Australia is pretty big on that list surprisingly.
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:10:54
cheers, o man this is funny. bitcoin is too useful ay.
@_date: 2014-06-02 12:23:07
better question is what can you afford to live without for a period of time.
if you invest $100 and u can live without that $100 for few months id say you are safe to invest that now.
now try that with $1000 and ask if you can live without that money for at least a year.
if bitcoin goes under you can wait it out and maybe get it back later.
no risk no reward.
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:29:41
holy shit that is interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:42:54
if u can follow through with this and coordinate something that would be amazing. keep us updated. im very interested.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:26:41
what is with all these weird comments... this is a good article i always wondered more his thoughts on bitcoin and how he got in to it.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:00:36
never heard of them before, doesnt paypal rule all here anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:34:48
because u cant convert dogecoin in to fiat easily yet. its safer to go dogecoin&gt;bitcoin&gt;fiat
@_date: 2014-08-29 01:03:53
this is sad... talk about stealing from the people
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:49:48
u can try mycelium app. it has a buy sell fuction that helps u locate traders.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:12:19
hope this takes off
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:26:45
how old is your account and how many comments have u got on it?
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:00:52
what is the bet they cashed out.
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:18:09
good stuff!
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:43:50
yeah for now but after gox u never know when a zhao tong gox is gona happen. i mean for gods sakes the guy responsible for one of the worst btc failures is running again
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:17:35
i dont know why everyone is doubting it. it sounds interesting wouldnt mind seeing what will happen with it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:13:18
sending any amount of value anywhere in the world for free.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:33:33
man, eric is so sure. i feel like he just doesnt want to go back on his word or its just his way of accepting a loss.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:19:43
yeah, i think only for public keys. but that is a good idea create open source for running offline for private, why not pimp out your private keys ay.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:43:25
get a group funding going on and it will be worth your time.
@_date: 2014-10-16 07:42:02
pretty sure broke is just trying to dip his fingers in to everything bitcoin related. unfortunately a lot of those ventures  a ran by fools.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:47:26
sounds like the phone for me and im in australia. honestly i dont like holding a phone around that costs a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-31 14:28:41
he is a very logical guy. i dont think he can pass this up as something lame.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:20:32
well good finish at the end.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:25:58
lol well thanks for that extra piece of info
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:10:37
i hate the going to the bar and using cash. they have give back change and whole process is slow. i dont get why its so hard to just scan a QR code and be done.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:28:01
nice page to show people.

@_date: 2014-11-24 14:12:24
hm, seems unusually steep...
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:19:01
yeah, i feel like there is a lot of payed shills in bitcoin reddit now. even some well known redditors with old accounts are getting a little dodge. just unfortunate that reddit bitcoin is still the fastest way to get news.
i might consider leaving reddit bitcoin very soon though and maybe just read coindesk.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:23:09

dude! we will get through this. i have hope man!
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:37:47
most important part was when he explained the hoarding issue. he did well.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:08:39
foreigners can use them, u cant withdraw fiat unless u got korean bank account though.
@_date: 2014-05-03 10:46:07

@_date: 2014-04-07 08:40:40
This Naomi Brockwell sounds Australian.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:38:03
haha interesting info. mark does appear a little arrogant in the sense that he feels he can solve everything himself. he could of let go of mtgox and let someone else manage it a long time ago and just control from a distance.
i feel he has the attitude of old nerds doing all the work themselves in the garage and changing the world from nothing.
i dont think this scenario is as common now though.
we shall see ay.
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:17:17
i read it twice!
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:26:33
none. that is what i find so annoying about peoples discussions these last few days. pure FUD.
everything u will find does not have any clear source or proof.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:23:14
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:57:32
i agree, it's really hard to read in to what he really means/thinks.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:20:08
cheers. im interested in brock because he wants mtgox.
SWEET, got downvoted for no reason.
@_date: 2014-07-04 17:34:46
kidding me....
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:33:59
i feel like dell acceptance was big news
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:36:15
im always surprised how much comments are posted on yahoo whenever bitcoin is the topic. is it typical to have 50 or so comments for articles such as this, it wasnt even a lot of information in here.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:38:20
fuck me something else is going on. there is so much hidden when it comes to the 'lost' bitcoins. im surprised even up till now nothing has been leaked.
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:14:27
i remember u could still deposit fiat and buy bitcoins from gox but couldnt withdraw. this was before aprils mass crash.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:02:13
i tissue like kleenex is not good for this job. u need something more absorbent.
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:38:23
watch it buddy, u hanging with the big boys now.
@_date: 2014-08-05 11:51:00
ay thanks for link timestamp.
im not against alix jones. just frustrated cause i thought bitcoin was right up his alley and seemed hypocritical that he didnt give it a chance.
but now he figured it out.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:18:28
sounds pretty big...
@_date: 2014-01-23 11:46:04
jumped up pretty fast last few dayz
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:18:55
yeah would be good.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:40:12
there are some trusted people i believe are known to recover bitcoin they have been proven good folk with a history of only talking the % someone might know the guys name. maybe on bitcointalk
@_date: 2014-07-23 23:24:12
more like they are investigating a lost cause with a huge amount of unnecessary secrecy or something big, yes.
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:04:04

what a cyber bully
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:38:27
just looking at 4.4% looks insane now....
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:24:49
bottom line is
"Officials have said that they were unsure whether the disappearance of about 850,000 Bitcoins from Mt Gox’s vaults was a result of theft, fraud or mismanagement, or a combination of these."
so anything goes, including we found bitcoin magically. this just sounds shady because of the lack of transparency. although this is good news we still feel ripped off.
Make this problem fully public knowledge so the community can work on this mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:46:03
i hope so man cause they like own the world.
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:50:58
nice concept.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:21:15
Games are won by players who focus on the playing field – not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:23:26
i love that ad
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:38:01
one thing i noticed is the location thing is so accurate it actually puts down your house number. i think this is potentially dangerous. the location should only give a location of area and perhaps screet only. not number. i didnt notice this until later.
put it this way. if someone is selling lot of bitcoin he doesnt want the world to pin point them.
EDIT: i know u can edit this but I see people making the mistake of first using the auto locate and leaving it. telling the whole world where they live.
@_date: 2014-04-25 19:46:20
great minds think alike
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:10:16

ha, i like how u explained that.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:23:54
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:40:09
i believe you, it sounds terrible. the only places that seem to do ok at it are low cost labor countries, do u agree?
for example china where they make everything anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:24:03
mtgox stuff was the most recent one.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:04:27
well said.
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:30:34
dont get it?
@_date: 2014-06-14 07:40:01
good job bitcoin, good job.
@_date: 2014-08-11 09:30:06
whats wrong with it?
its from it shows stable periods of bitcoin. people are obsessed with the volatility but this chart/graph shows stable periods.
a new perspective can be helpful.
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:32:20
id like some review of this. it seems to convenient and sudden to be true.
would someone in argentina go test buying btc out and report back?
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:20:06
taxi drivers hate using cards due to the processing fee. bitcoin and taxi services would be a perfect match. not to mention the speed of scanning a QR code on the go as apposed to swiping and inputting a pin.

said this before, we need to change the logo from clipart to something legit looking.

who designed this? looks freaking confusing but a nice style.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:37:42
these are collectors items now, should keep it or sell it. the irony in them, such speechless.
@_date: 2014-09-13 09:56:51
wow that is a lot
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:47:11
shut it u commy. he supported it early enough.
@_date: 2014-10-16 04:14:04
good question, how big is Actuaries?
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:45:28
this happens all the time in bitcoin. hype and announcements with half done ideas.
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:33:16
where can i watch this ipo price?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:06:50
:O !!
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:16:41
yeah but spendbitcoins.com they provide annon service that is why its expensive i believe. the only good thing about coinjar is there semi ok fee. although they seem to price the bitcoin more expensively anyway as veroxii mentioned. so dunno beginning to think same difference.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:48:32

I would like to add to this. If trading fees are the key here for paying the gox debt, there needs to be a larger incentive to use this exchange.
Some of the following exchange features could make this exchange appealing to new users:
- alt coins trading
- variety of security options (safe address, time lock out, 2fac)
- have extra trading features for payed accounts (extra trade data, info, charts and speed? suggestions needed)
- introduce trading points (internal exchange currency)
- introduce programmable coin features (would need ideas for this but this hasnt been explored enough)
- redesign trading interface and have a few options for traders (could purchase different interfaces)
this could be a good opportunity to create something much more interesting and bitcoin centric to what we have now. right now most exchanges dont offer anything unique besides the odd coin or fee rate.
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:16:41
sounds good. dont know why this has never been talked about in depth before.
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:05:07
this is a good idea. especially if a street performance video goes  viral!!
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:52:19
cheers! good caution
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:09:48
TulipCoins is pretty famous troll-lo
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:18:38
5 btc sounds like a lot now. feels good.
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:18:24
i like the idea behind it cheers. i really dislike facebook cause of all the noise, adverts, feed and the whole they own your pictures thing. would welcome something that you own and control.
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:09:26
i think a lot of people are doing this now, its fighting the negative pressure of merchants and newly minted coins, hence the some what stable price over the last 2 months.
 &lt;-- this shows from the orange line the stability.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:28:34
i would like to make some bitcoin contacts in Korea. i should be there mid year.
going to add you guys to my friends list.
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:00:49
yep... well if it gets bad just switch to another coin.
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:17:01
so much waste!
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:13:37
god old and still struggling engineer programmer, the real american dream.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:32:11
yeah... our high standard of living as made us the brunt of being ripped off.
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:46:13
yeah nice. im appreciating the fact you can get set up with a btc processor fast.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:22:36
let me correct u, its going to be gox now.
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:08:47
its either silly police investigation leading no where or something pretty interesting. most likely something to do with silk road and money laundering.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:13:21
shills man
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:21:32
yeah i know ay!
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:30:16
looks fast ay
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:36:50
it went good imo!!!
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:03:47
omg just use name namecoin. distribute the power. dont just use bitcoin.
i really dont understand this.
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:07:47
this is what im waiting for. the device needs to be fully tested in the wild before i get one.
from reading and researching the device does seem attractive as a btc storage unit.
@_date: 2014-01-25 07:27:22
this def a sign of a start of a bubble!
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:17:13
dont know why this isnt more common, seems like a efficient way to get attention.
@_date: 2014-03-19 09:30:57
yeah, no body knew for sure what was going on. only gox did and they should of closed shop or been honest so people could make a better call.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:32:24
yeah just didnt seem obvious they were talking about the banks
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:47:43
yeah i need more information. how about if u r in australia? will this cost anything?
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:54:00
lol who would of thought! over 100 or over 1000
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:24:52
id like to see this!
@_date: 2014-10-20 10:10:58
guy looks cool.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:50:26
hard to read all of this. but sum it up: bitcoin is safe for a couple of years at least.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:15:48
i see its not a robofail. should be all good to go!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:49:44
send me owl coinszzz
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:12:42
good job
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:24:32
please make this happen!
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:38:40
if you are basing this of public information there is still way to much missing from the story. for example there is no details what so ever on these points:
- evidence of coins stolen (on the blockchain)
- if it was stolen how, when and was it over a long period
- how much is really stolen
- why is he quoted as saying "unavailable". what does it mean!
also this recent conversation on IRC:
[23:30] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [13:23:56] &lt;hrumph_web&gt;  &lt;- he basically describes what we are doing, in slightly different (and illegal under japanese law) terms
[23:30] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [13:29:41] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; if you try to avoid bankruptcy now you will be dragged down again by creditors &lt;- civil rehabilitation allows us to make creditors owners of the company in exchange for the debts
context of above: 
seems to me a possibility a new exchange will open at some point and mark may not be as in control of the exchange anymore. but how can this happen if none of the above is explained. bottom line is there needs to be an explanation and saying "the bitcoin disappeared" doesnt fly.
unless you have more information.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:08:59
share the jerky when u up and runnin
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:37:40
nice interview. good work.
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:53:37
luck is with u!
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:14:47
all i can think of is mark trying to one up the twins again. he wont just leave bitcoin alone imo. i mean facebook bought the VR company, how random is that, btc intergration small or big doesnt sound far fetched at all.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:27:43
wow thank god still people alive to do bitcoin in ukraine
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:50:44
can anyone confirm if the exchange ANX would be a good option here, since they are HK based and they might have connections in Australian banking?
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:34:56
man! keep going!!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:01:43
well fuck i just hope whoever takes over can resume withdraws.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:24:18
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:16:31
You are a scholar
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:00:33
So fuking funny. got down voted for sayings its going up and look at it now. u guys are a joke here.
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:52:19
nice job man nice job
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:09:55
LOL i love that Jesus part.
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:53:42
i agree
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:17:42
not surprising as there bitcoin news was always really dodgy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:43:15
yeah we do. what kind of computer fraud did he do before who else knows  about it and how come nobody knows about this info for 5 years
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:41:01
hey pretty good
@_date: 2014-09-05 04:56:00
they need a windows version god damn it.
@_date: 2014-10-14 09:59:12
wow crazy!
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:24:44
the whole idea of bitcoin is global payment non friction. get this done duh.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:12:01
a little bit. but u got to focus on the community here, trying to solve some problems here not do wat everyone else is doing... being hopeless.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:11:41
good idea!
but i could see people giving the private key address by accident here. just looked at the position of the words private key and then next to it the private key.... very confusing.
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:26:40
is this thing accurate?
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:42:13
what do u think. u would to have this inside your body?
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:59:56
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:40:44
LOL 11 is good
@_date: 2014-11-26 08:49:15
is this for real, i dont know how kraken can afford to payout creditors. half a billion dollar on hand yeah right.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:32:55
last part was pretty speculative. but yes there is strong evidence that much btc is probably in goxs control.
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:21:30
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:34:04
o man this is too soon too the robocoin fiasco.
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:37:11
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:52:09
i agree tiger needs to give more incentive.
@_date: 2014-06-29 13:49:02
man i hope they will do a good job if they get it.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:53:23
if u can think it, it will happen
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:20:17
just take them!
@_date: 2014-10-13 08:49:58
i see. do u know if there are any figures?
bitfury has a massive mining operation in Iceland, i suspect it probably produces the most BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:38:15
yeah u should do a test run with decent colors and try and source some good paper and methods to do it. Id love to see an example because your regular book looks great!
ill have to make some new stuff and gather some old stuff again but id like to make a art book one day. Here are some random things ive done: 
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:36:18
just watched there ad, god thats funny.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:56:18
wow 200. well good for u. stay strong and move on!!!!
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:26:09
shouldnt this be a coinbase thing?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:23:32
stop speaking french it hurts my eyes.
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:21:39
are u even a bitcoin noob? they said they wanted to invite noobs.
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:11:26
i called it. people already factored in what they will do and u can see it in price well before the news.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:33:08
interesting. i suppose if there was more nuke plants we could really get a proper study. if new plants are made to withstand worse case scenarios maybe it is better.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:35:16
$0.05 @_date: 2014-08-01 17:24:56
still puts me off, what if u dont use facebook.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:09:45
hope it happens but i think people r right, they r going to be to slow to move.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:29:58
thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2014-01-31 14:29:37
ahh bitcoin could do so many interesting things with games
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:17:51
wow interesting. how popular is  ?
from the stocks chart they look resonablly big for games such as farmvil
edit: hole crap 2,183 ranked web site in the world is pretty big right?
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:02:35

@_date: 2014-02-13 16:45:46
yeah i see what i wrote. ill be watching this fed.
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:41:04
Can someone explain to me why it is so hard to do this internationally?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:09:59
Falkvinge is a legend.

just relighting the cigar. sometimes u need to do it.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:23:16
the site doesnt look like its up. it just says future home of something cool
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:24:55
arent they still splitting? i tired to do this but ended up giving up it took to long
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:31:56
yeah im finding if i bring up bitcoin to random people there is a much bigger chance they know of it. compare that to only 6 months ago the difference is large.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:53:37
interesting. would of liked it more if it was goxes coins
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:08:18
annnnnnnnnd i smashed my iphone...
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:43:45
i need to watch this doc now. please someone give access to it now.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:07:16
doesnt look real. looks shopped in.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:55:15
arent these guys suppose to be rioting right now.
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:32:36
gentlemen like.
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:45:39
i like the ad but i fee like another ms paint ad would be in order. perhaps a come back of the wizard or not. either way ms paint style.
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:48:04
fuck ya! they r using my edited animation.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:39:51
if u r for real u deserve funding from the foundation
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:41:05
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:02:42
would of been better if they said "magical internet money"

do u really? how do use drones in your business?

@_date: 2014-07-04 14:12:23
brilliant. a true artist.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:33:55
silly waiting for 1 confirmation for low amounts of bitcoin. the effort put in to double spending wouldnt be worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:58:09
yeah just be careful
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:22:15
dont forget halving in 2016
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:15:28
is this serious? who cares what he was wearing...
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:39:38
maybe if bitcoin does become a 'surveillance coin' people will move on to something more private like zerocoin.
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:48:03
has the silence got anything to do with gox???
@_date: 2014-05-07 09:49:18
thats smart. so incognito is not effected by your google use history?
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:59:17
typical, overlook investing in design.
@_date: 2014-10-08 19:32:49
she always does this, she asks the same questions for the noobs to learn.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:35:07
it is totally unfair for them to take out money before all the other poor sods.
infact they should be last because they most likely had inside information and using it at the expense of everyone else.
the foundation is suppose to be looking out for the little guys and further bitcoin but seem to be doing jack and behind closed doors.
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:01:41
LOL nice
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:28:16
really? i guess its different in some places.
on the radio i heard taxis have have a love hate relationship with the card processors here. mostly charging customers way more than neccecry when using a card: 
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:18:53
LOL why does everyone keep saying this. he is not that bad. seems people want hollywood winning actor or Martha Luther King.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:19:26
gox price is no longer accurate. but if anyone has money on gox u can still trade at this price. its just really hard to get money in and out of it now.
@_date: 2014-08-21 12:33:11
he might not be wrong about the war part. war/conflict has been known to cause gold prices to go up.
Maybe btc will be a sort of refuge in times of strife.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:25:26
yeah, kind of gathered that but just the title of post was misleading.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:45:05
damn so in otherwords still dont know what happened.
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:46:13
oh namecoin. you are so underrated
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:25:42
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:24:45
angers me
@_date: 2014-01-24 09:57:31
lol so true
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:00:17
agreed. this is a quality one because its true.
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:47:48
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:34:17
hope he wins. he will put those coins to good use.
@_date: 2014-08-10 12:19:29
do i like it that i what i mean. im going to miss seeing this in the future,
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:55:45
what is this?
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:59:10
cheers i learnt what Laissez-faire means.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:09:26
hah cool game!!
@_date: 2014-07-25 00:19:21
nice words
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:39:52
holy shit
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:44:59
is that true? can you dig for a source for me? i always wanted to read the book. never got around to it because i thought id be disappointed but might change my mind now.
@_date: 2014-05-03 03:46:38
he is a smart guy but he is a bit too old to care about technology like bitcoin.
probably doesnt even have a ereader yet.
@_date: 2014-10-13 10:25:04
probably selling OTC to a big investor that doesnt want to buy on exchanges.
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:57:59
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:07:39
yeah im pretty sure u cant do too much with coinjar they have limits unless u really get your identity reveled with them and build up a withdraw deposit limit. there is no way around it.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:17:40
if i threw pennies at your body u would like it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:21:51
u guys see to the moon guy on twitter there. he is awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:08:55
they didnt really fix the article. the part of the story describing mark k's beverage is incorrect. from a direct source i know for a fact it was a 'desert-like coffee beverage' not a starbucks coffee.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:19:26
The Twins bail out gox!
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:41:29
bit disappointing but it wont matter in 3 months, the how r u gona regulate the net.
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:42:52
this was settled and decided ages ago.
'Magic Internet Money' is what it is and what it will stay for me.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:26:11
let us know what happens.
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:58:35
barely any cost to set up and all to gain really. just need to put some minds on it.
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:29:21
isnt this good for africa since they r the ones that using phone for money
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:03:25
man... was a pretty dumb thing to do....
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:35:34
yeah, it was a good strategy so that he cant be a type of martyr which he most likely would of been.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:41:12
my god that logo is BAD! when will it die!
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:36:30
respect for wiki went down a lot due to this. no excuses. something doesnt feel right in the internal workings. probably so buddy buddy with paypal and the old banking system they are getting funded by them to manipulate the 'free' source of information.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:49:53
:) heavy stuff
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:28:58
yeah this is what i think too. problem is the QR readers in pretty much all the wallet apps suck so bad they cant read these.
there is zero awareness of this.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:05:13
god why is she playing this role. she used to be pretty open to the idea but now she is playing around.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:07:25
the card isnt as good as i thought because there is too many fees. for example:
i want to buy 10$ meal. i use card and xapo converts 10$ worth of my bitcoin in to USD for a fee and again convert USD to AUD for another fee. plus there is probably a small transaction fee with that.
now if u do a 500$ transaction you can imagine the fees are going to be insane.
this card is only ok if you are local to the euro, pound or USD, and even then it is unknown if this is even worth it because u will still have to pay for a conversion fee and perhaps a hidden spread for buy and selling on xapo part.
unless xapo eats the conversion fee on some level. maybe for lower buy amounts this is really a round about way of using btc and expensive one at that.
i was really hoping for a decent card to be used internationally but it really isnt.
this is not just xapo but for all the card that claim to implement bitcoin with glee.
we need more CLEAR information and examples.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:34:12
it mean that if people sue they can not take from the people that 'lost coins'
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:49:32
i remember that. the first one is pretty damn good. id like to see that used despite it being far from the mspaint style. we could always revisit the mspaint style.
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:11:08
Lol this happened to me in perth
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:59:34
wow really nice. perfect example of what is going on.
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:27:49
calm before storm ay. lets hope so.
@_date: 2014-04-26 10:34:56
how solid is this??
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:58:00
bitcoin bounties for seeders and original content loaders should be a whole area. i hope there is more integration at torrent sites where you can advertise wanted goods and place bounties and also have others add to it.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:20:26
well if they are under a gag order than gox is highly likely under a gag.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:33:35
can someone really test this out and report back. i watched the video but dont think i get how it works.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:08:59
can anyone translate this?
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:32:16
i think maybe it was a bit to long. but this kind of thing i guess cant be rushed right?
maybe i was just impatient.
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:23:41
too many crowd-funding crypto sites now, it is sort of diluting any projects from getting funded because they are all spread out. 
this might be a case where more isnt better?
i suppose this is open source and that is why its different? goodlucky anyway my the best platform win.
@_date: 2014-09-15 06:02:52
after having a look online there seems to be a lot of smartphones that are near 35-50 dollars. not sure how special this is anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:22:06
moscow ay? this is interesting
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:36:15
if it does i might buy a lot. ive been pretty careful about buying now but im ready for any dips.
@_date: 2014-08-02 12:07:34
what r u on about. he is right in the sense that banks and the money system is complete joke.
fractional reserve banking x 100000000 everywhere, how is this sustainable.
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:12:51
that guy talks really strange but he knows what is going on with bitcoin and where it could go. decent video to watch.
@_date: 2014-09-03 00:32:05
Google is so wealthy its hard to fathom. these fees are way too much. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:50:38
:) watch and learn my friend. trade on the news.
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:17:19
im thinking of amazing using drones to deliver everything.
i can imagine individuals buying drone to deliver there own goods. if u have a business it could run itself.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:23:46
yeah i kind of was like wtf wow how can he be so sure. there was not official info. but for the most part he is awesome.
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:15:45
btcjam has soo many scammers and the support and control on the site is so bad.
maybe its changed but it looked way to unusable last time i looked at it a few months ago.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:46:29
cheers man. ive seen those renders around a lot. they r good!
@_date: 2015-05-07 12:51:30
so beautiful. it's alive.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:30:35
to the moon man.
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:58:42
nice looking site
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:44:19
should of left out that u are a girl. this is taking up valuable btc reddit space now.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:48:41
o man i want to get one of these but they said it would take 3 months just to arrive. its hard to estimate if its worth waiting that long.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:30:59
yep, this is interesting. i remember when this was pointed out before. it was right on time with much of the gox news.
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:49:23
is this true. i dont understand enough to judge.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:38:05
people will be interested. just tell us. when the site is up
@_date: 2014-09-25 10:08:45

@_date: 2015-05-13 15:16:36
"World Wide Ledger" = WWL
Now that is a useful set of words.
Will use this.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:02:21
well i got a corolla. these things never die i tell you.
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:36:28
they just dont understand it and that makes them insecure.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:36:20
this. u could learn a few things on the way too.
@_date: 2014-09-19 07:29:40
yeah i dont mind it. like says: as long as it gets people talking about it.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:38:36
god such a pity about the price.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:23:46
pretty cool. id like to see some videos and demonstrations and examples of usage. im sure that will help with sales.
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:50:28
same. first ive seen of this chat log. also dont see dates only times and what time really is this.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:19:09
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:02:39
Ƀ = better
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:18:45
tell me about it.... ive read like 2000 pages worth of text and information these past few weeks.
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:43:58
good info here.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:04:31
yeah im wondering. how can we confirm this 100%?
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:29:19
i like the logo. looks like we dont give a fuck.
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:34:56
lol that looks so lame
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:33:55
annnnnnd still no blockchain proof. i call bullcrap.
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:51:59
wow i feel so offended by this
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:58:26
calling @_date: 2014-07-03 11:46:30
max kaiser suggested it first i think.
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:25:13
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:46:08
knock them dead man. keep it real.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:35:32
pretty cool.
I must say that art work for over 20 bitcoin is way over priced.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:25:21
I've been aware of all these concern from some of the smartest people but what if yes AI got so superior what would be the reason to even harm humens?
i imagine the AI would go do their own thing, perhaps go off in to space where they can actually survive better than us.
seems almost insignificant issue for AI to deal with humens if they ever get to a point of extreme intelligence.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:47:45
very nice
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:43:21
im unclear here. when i click link it asks for registration. this information is not reliable this way.
@_date: 2014-08-14 10:04:07
above is NSFW
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:47:46
someone smart+time summrise this please
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:04:11
@_date: 2014-04-30 08:40:45
bring it on i say. let the price fall as far as it can, i want to see where it goes.
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:05:03
I think what he is trying to clear up is that the bitcoin protocol is secure. A lot of people still think you can hack bitcoin itself.
He was just making a bank comparison because everyone knows banks and pins.
I actual think Bobby is a great speaker, he uses simple examples to get an idea across, in this case, bitcoins insane amount of private keys.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:32:13
we need this equilibrium. right now things are uncertain and nothing is moving forward because so much bitcoin is locked.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:24:17
lol true. least there is some sort of foundation.
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:12:36
sounds awesome
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:59:35
they cant just take btc because u are underage there should be a path to solve these issues, inquire about it. probably parental consent like others have mentioned.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:39:54
really doesn't surprise me that the news is getting the information wrong. they are jumping to conclusions like making people have.
how many time has the mainstream reports been wrong on bitcoin and pushed FUD agenda. to many times to count if i recall.
why is it different here. sure there is a problem but it is not clear yet.
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:23:58
do you work in bali?
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:13:28
interesting styles.
noticed some korean wording. no wonder the style looks the way it does, know ive seen it somewhere.
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:03:05
i enjoyed that very much
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:05:43
this is great for anyone that wants to learn about bitcoins and why it is interesting.
any doubters should give this the time of day.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:40:21
well they would be in a bank in a safe deposit box. if there is any such thing as hard-copies in existence and he has trouble accessing them maybe higher powers like government/bank r holding it ransom.
tinfoil hate but more believable frankly than the story 'mark lost the keys'
@_date: 2014-09-10 03:24:00
i dont think so but things might of changed.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:24:34
i remember first getting in to bitcoin and not knowing what was going on. your comments always stood out to me and helped me see past the FUD.
for anyone knew to bitcoin feeling a stressed out about the price just wait a few years. think long term!
dont double down unless u can realistically afford too.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:57:03
stay strong!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:33:21
crazy watching the fed talking about bitcoin, a year ago it was a joke.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:58:53
that youtube promotional video is freaking different. i like it.
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:55:24
who gives a fuck. its open source anyway so people can make there own and rename it. 
the original will always been known as darkmarket and frankly its pretty cool.
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:53:32
so what country is Szabo from?
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:35:48
is this new news?? they got told this give me a some more information.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:36:19
exactly! all speculation and people are blowing it up like fact. god damn maybe charlie was right after all?
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:37:02
im watching the device like a hawk!
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:53:31
 god damn!
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:14:49
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:49:11
no proof no way.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:52:37
yeah true.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:48:49
Local Trader... come on hurry up!!!!!

@_date: 2014-03-20 16:42:13
bla bla bla. too volatile, cry me a river.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:19:18
this is actually a bit hard to follow. but good to have this out there anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:19:31
actually think the fee idea is dated. its better to use the chinese method and provide additional services.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:07:35
nothing wrong with it. i just thought it addressed it well.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:37:43
.......... impossible. my mind is blown by the vary theory someone could lock themselves out of this much btc.
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:54:21
can believe im seeing comments down voted. i read the whole thing and its far better idea any other exchange has put forward by far!
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:29:26
annnnndd i lost much $ cause of this crash
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:49:01
great stuff, his point is relevant to many things in life. Being an expert in an area can make one inflexible to other ideas.

they are advisers. im sure they will help xapo along.
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:08:20
thanks. really should be info on what this is about because its long.
@_date: 2014-01-29 08:43:52
HAHA what do u mean! u mean the troll lolos?
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:43:49
only double... i think he could be wrong there.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:04:28
i find it pretty interesting. depends how you package it.
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:32:53
for me yesterday. it is good to know im not alone man.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:24:03
good point
@_date: 2014-10-13 10:47:04
'fair rate' i cant believe they even market this as so.
always thought i was getting ripped each time and now its even worse.
it is going to be a struggle for coinjar unless they offer something different.
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:45:29
that was beautiful
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:06:33
haha boy that was near the despair, so much fear there.

those are all subject questions. seems pretty wrong to say there is a perfect answer.
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:18:08

is this worth reading? why is it always AI = Humen extinction.
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:02:28
yeah maybe...
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:41:40
great interview.
@_date: 2014-05-18 12:34:59
same news recycled?
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:25:39
i was under the impression this is the creators upload? if not this is a scum move.
they creators should have released this video like this before hand...
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:25:42
have to say this is really nice work.
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:13:41
or maybe he is beginning to believe.
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:31:13
wow nice!
@_date: 2014-01-25 09:58:23
this angers me a bit
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:26:49
i recorded your email for the future. cheers.
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:38:55
dont know what to say. im so sick of reports like this. watever!
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:39:15
tell me about it.
this cut off at 30 is depressing.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:04:52
i just want to get off........... resume withdraws!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:08:53
your a legend.
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:24:57
buying and using bitcoin is a pretty fast way to learn. just buy a small amount.
@_date: 2014-10-20 10:26:50
boy i hope this counterparty system takes off. it is going to help show just how useful the blockchain is.
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:09:58
same reaction as everyone else here; surprised by how positive they speak of btc.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:05:03
still transparency for this sort of thing seems damn important. I for one am curious.
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:30:52
im not the greatest catcher but practice makes perfect.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:45:56
yes it is
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:42:21
yeah functionality of mycelium is the best!
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:04:46
ive been waiting for this.
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:58:34
i see too much friction with m-pesa.
bitcoin is international.
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:39:06
good point i doubt it will be any of those
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:36:06
look at the exchange right 
just insane.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:03:08
yeah but there is more and more ways to make it more untraceable. darkwallet and various alt coins for example.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:35:42
compare that too other countries that dont even have exchange, id say its good.
@_date: 2014-06-20 10:30:28
man everything is coming soon... getting pretty damn annoying i must say.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:17:33
it is him.
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:24:22
i dont see how this is going to work. how will they recreate the network and mining bitcoin has.
they are going to create a small ecosystem that will be vulnerable.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:47:56
makes btc look really cool.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:06:33
of topic but does anyone think the mastercard logo is a mess now?
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:15:16
contact the foundation now
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:39:06
holy shit they look good.
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:22:54
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:07:04
Good job!
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:47:37
yeah not sure about that. maybe dont have as much knowledge on it but more and more have heard about it. they do have news here u know.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:38:38
korea is the shit when it comes to bitcoin. yes, not many places accept it but there is an active community here and a lot of smart people working on infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:54:56
how many coins did ross have?
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:56:51
pretty weak ad i must say....
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:35:45
they should make it 25% max after all the bs they put everyone through.
@_date: 2014-08-23 11:20:59
cheers. that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:57:39
he speaks alright. he isnt hyping anything. just telling it how it is.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:39:45
damn, i cant wait for this!
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:10:51
haha sent them a little bit. super responsive ay.
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:09:52
i like the cross on the letter b on the logo. hipster b. cool app too.
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:02:23
yeah right. try buying anything with m-pesa online internationally.
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:34:01
i like this idea. id put in a little to see this happen.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:54:12
blockpay.net has some spelling errors. surprises me these apparently big and rich Chinese players are too stingy to even hire a real English speaker to proof read.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:01:07
damn well said
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:06:42
they are pulling a wiki. take forever to accept and missing out on the hype.
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:59:37
this is awesome. but all this btc accepted news i cant help but feel merchants are putting most of the negative pressure on btc price atm. thoughts?
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:48:31
i approve of this. hopefully it will reduce clutter.
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:00:43
ah thanks, didnt hear that.
@_date: 2016-03-13 13:52:04
U can try Bitholla, not a wallet per say but you can use any wallet you like with it. More user friendly.
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:49:48
hurry up!
id lol if these come out and an exploit is found soon after.
i think the sooner these r out the better. least we will find out how solid these are.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:30:16
Will u bring back korean won?
Why was it removed?
So far there is no other exchanges that deal with the currency outside if South Korea.
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:14:41
i agree with the GUI. they need a fucking update its almost at the joke point now. the site just looks scammy as and all they need to do is spend a little on the graphics.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:33:38
lol hypester!
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:17:11
me too. have to reload site from address bar.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:35:27
that was nicely said
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:20:59
From all the months of reading about blocksize and bitcoin direction, this article is what i believe bitcoin should be.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:17:10
i agree. noticed this too. luckily a lot of the good mtgox stuff is getting through. although surprisingly not high enough.
could also be a lot of people sick of hearing the gox news and if u are one of those downvoters the gox story isnt finished and it is important for the btc community to figure what happened.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:39:08
Checkout bitholla.io or search google play. But basically u can use any wallet. Still early stages but u might like the usability of it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:39:02
wat exchanges is this?
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:41:25
would also like to know best source
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:18:08
the article goes in to the options part, its not about bisq.
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:17:57
This exchange software allows anyone to run an exchange, as for regulation that is up to the individual to handle. A load of countries doesn't even have clear rules for crypto holding so up to the exchange operator to self-regulate.
@_date: 2019-11-19 12:17:18
Adding another category to this list under [opensource exchange]( software I think would supplement this list.
The issue with these P2P marketplaces is that they are rather slow and fiddly and are a totally different user experience to a real exchange, not to mention a [massive lack of liquidity (this is AUS orderbook).](
Instead of more zero liquidity P2P exchanges, there needs to be more actual proper exchanges that create competition amongst major exchanges. If more business offered well ran exchanges there would least be a larger poor to select from.
@_date: 2016-06-09 08:41:24
 has been working fine for me.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:49:38
this is good for bitcoin, more exchanges will lead to more adoption! how we get there is through mass trading.

lets hope for the best. 0.01! lets make usa good again.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:13:44
I agree
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:21:53
hey this was alright. should get more up votes.
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:34:58
tried it but only see contacts that seem to have used telebit only. cant you send to all of the telegram contact list.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:36:55
almost as bad as the current bitcoin logo
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:48:33
this was awhile ago.
still a good show.
@_date: 2015-07-22 06:52:40
the guide does seem pretty long but it was much needed. good to see more how to bitcoin stuff.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:35:15
very cool!
keep developing it.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:33:33
nice line
@_date: 2015-08-13 10:00:29
i see thanks for response.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:44:17
is there a video for this?
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:20:53
Everytime bitcoins price goes up the bitcoin transaction fees edge towards expensive territory and I think because of this we have to have that reality.
  
It is also creating an opportunity to go for broke and just reduce the block size to 300kB as proposed by This will spawn more full nodes to help decentralize the network while simultaneously incentives second layer solutions (great business opportunities).
If a full node can sync on the shittest of phones one day that would be the ultimate.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:40:21
enjoyed reading that. just the other day there was an article on minecraft and bitcoin. seems gaming and bitcoin have many cool uses.
i can see people trading items more efficiently via blockchain
@_date: 2016-02-17 07:25:23
When did you post a claim? If you did it awhile ago just sit back and wait for more info, Im pretty sure they will send email or u can just find out more info from other people on reddit here.
alternately u can check here:
There is a meeting tomorrow in Japan for this whole Mtgox thing. We should find out more after that is done.
Chances are we will have to wait for another year just to get our BTC. The gears of justice move slow.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:06:34
nice vid
@_date: 2016-02-02 03:14:01
This is a good idea. Dont stop at video subs, u can do books and all sorts of publications.
I know ive ran in to a lot of asian magazines and art books i wish could be translated quickly and efficantly.
@_date: 2016-02-17 07:15:07
Can find a better view of the artwork here:
I got a lot more designs but just wanted to see if there is an interest in some alternative BTC shirt designs.
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:47:35
Is this new? Seems rather risky.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:31:51
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:50:33
seems a lot like bitmex? what are the differences?
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:29:39
Actually it was great. Might steal that :)
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:42:56


i left it open to all 2nd layer solutions although LN network is the first and most promising.  
I even think its okay to have a load of tx handled internally say on an exchange or on other internal networks.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:29:02
doesn't this have the same problem in that once you give the data to [revealer.cc]( company now know private key?
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:42:22
is it me or does that article read weirdly.
@_date: 2016-09-27 03:27:45
So this is an atm in seoul. Far as i know coinplug a bitcoin exchange has connections to an atm network. Its pretty impressive but as far as i know volume of btc used here is low. Particularly with atms.
I still feel proud for btc when i see it at the atm though  :)

@_date: 2015-04-02 17:08:36
well all the Chinese and Korean ones are free.
Kraken:  (they charge both buy and sell)
Bitstamp is also on sell and buy but near the same if not cheaper:
all exchanges are slightly different. i think gox was 0.65%
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:33:44
na, only ever saw bid and ask and buy and sell.

@_date: 2015-04-15 13:12:02
 
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:30:58
wouldn't this include some insane fee and costs like xapo?
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:55:49
taker and maker, first ive seen using those terms.
normally its bid ask or buyer seller.
fee doesnt seem that bad.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:36:24
Hi Bruce,
Sorry for late reply.
I was thinking mostly where funding goes.
But I think what everyone else suggests would be better and more detailed.
@_date: 2015-04-24 03:22:57
wow disappointed to see yet another coin. put effort in to developing something in and for bitcoin, god damn it.
@_date: 2016-10-05 08:19:33

ultimately he hasn't bought (bitcoins) but still learning and trying to keep up with the tech. seems to understand its likeness to gold.
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:16:04
can u link me to his work? im curious.
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:01:22

@_date: 2018-04-19 11:56:57
when i did the demo looks good but was expecting a fee somewhere to help u see the damage using the payment system. am i missing something? or is it only once u pay you will see the fee?
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:11:05

@_date: 2015-03-21 17:53:28
If one chooses to invest will there be a bitcoin option?
edit: nevermind, looks like no bitcoin option.
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:04:09
not for profit right?
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:54:49
where can you get these printed and perforated?
@_date: 2015-03-11 06:13:52
sounds lovely
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:11:32
yeah, would be good to get this used more.
but the few people ive shown it too dont like or get it. they all seemed confused when they look at it.
maybe use 'what the heck is cryptocurrency' or 'digital money'?
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:21:59
@_date: 2015-03-28 05:18:56
i love that feeling... thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:40:59
can confirm. close also because thought it was paywalled.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:57:45
used this service other day and was awesome. had so many alts all over the place but didnt want to make new accounts at the different exchanges.
this site gives u an easy out of alts.

once u have a network of friends that use it, it becomes really useful.
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:05:57

@_date: 2015-03-10 15:04:50
Love this place!
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:15:47
Although complicated, working out a way to get direct bitcoin investment would be great. Please let it be known if you work this out.
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:14:09
still thing the single horizontal line on the bottom of the be is more elegant.

@_date: 2015-03-17 08:34:51
i need someone to work on the copy. something more commercial and less historic, at about 125 words.
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:30:16
come on!
id like to know how the blockchain can be recreated without the bitcoin incentive?
maybe they can create there own blockchain that is semi decentralized, where they spread the servers across the globe?
@_date: 2015-03-06 16:49:50
really cool!
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:22:34
good software this is
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:10:54
was this not under a different name before. i cant remember the domain.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:54:41
I hope this works.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:31:04
My process was:
1. Hit big red button 'skip preview'
2. Read "UNLOCK FULL VIDEO"
3. The 'No thanks' was only button looking thing on screen.
Honestly didn't even read or notice the option 3.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:48:30
if that is the case then what if there is more of it?

thx. its depressingly low ay. what is the deal!
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:00:21
what if we come around to what we have today? as in just more bank like crypto services and a majority just storing their btc with third parties?  
Will that hurt btc because then we start getting the same problems of blocking transactions, freezing accounts and blacklisting coins etc?
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:43:33
The article goes over the rapid trend towards centralization of digital asset storage services. It goes over some surprising statistics and the cons and pros of digital assets custody solution's
@_date: 2013-05-10 09:23:20
if u want to day trade just set up a 2 authentication on mtgox, its just way safer that way. not forever safe cause gox can still have problems itself.
if u dont wana trade u should just split the bitcoin up. some in cold storage some in gox and some in what u suggested carbonwallet if u feel thats great.
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:55:15
wow they let this air??
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:00:35
do u know how to check volumes for this?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:32:28
should go to top.@
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:05:38
ok, ive used this site mcxNOW and its pretty good if u sit on bitcoin on it. the returns are really good.
On the other hand the mcxFEE is really volatile and I'm currently down by investing in them.
Still if the site comes back online I'm hoping the mxcFEE will revive.
I would still deposit on the site because it was a great site. I after all withdrew all my btc and there was no problem.
People are dogging the site but its been around for a few months and if it comes back id probably consider using it again.
@_date: 2013-10-05 15:24:35
so its like ebay&gt;?
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:39:39
dont know much about this game but id love to see any game in general use bitcoin as a currency. it would almost be a natural thing to happen.
i mean if i was a game developer id seriously consider incorporating bitcoin in to the game.
edit: if developers injected even a tiny bit of bitcoin in to the game, players would go nuts just to earn them and infact would play longer. problem with this is bots, if bots are already farming in current mmo there will be even more bots now if 0.001 bitcoin was on offer.
it still would create a massive incentive to play. if the game gets wrecked with people buying stuff with bitcoin id like to see how an unregulated game economy would turn out with such a real currency like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:36:22
if you figure it out try and spread the word.
@_date: 2013-05-29 08:43:59

@_date: 2013-04-17 22:57:04

It is really hard to get any discussion going in bitcoin.org you have to have a lot of posts and you have to fight a lot of traffic.
I posted the idea and only got 2 comments.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:26:11
probably smart to sell small amounts as it goes up very quickly. this will help the speed of the rise slow down (other people do this) and if it does go faster and cause a crash at least u have some dollars to convert back in to coin.
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:48:09
doesnt matter he is just putting an idea out. someone else will make it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:01:17
: and 
a) as more true people who believe in it come in the higher the lows will be. we might always have people making it unstable but as it gets more and more expensive the new lows and new high are just going to be more and more higher overall. people that have a lot of bitcoin will always hold some bitcoin. the technology is too useful to give it zero value. how do u put a price on bittorrent for example.
b)there are systems in place that make bitcoin less risky to use as a vendor (having it instantly convert to other currency to avoid any flux) just need more time for people to accumlate more bitcoin and more systems and vendors to be in place.
c) if bitcoin keeps rising as it has 1% will be massive!!!
d) dont understand question.
at the end of the day it is both 1 and 2 because as the price gets higher i think it will stabilize somewhat but still have some live action the current nature of it being volatile is unique and it is annoying right now but it is getting a lot of attention and new people on board. it will continue to rise steadily on average.

this makes me want murder someone.
as much as id like to have bitcoin take off because some rich cunt put in some pocket change. i think id much rather them all be buried.

@_date: 2013-04-29 11:21:23
Listen to me. If you can buy a small amount do it but do it safely so you dont get scammed.
If you spend too much on bitcoin at 17 I'd say thats a silly risk and its probably wiser spending the money on what you need right now.
@_date: 2013-06-05 07:02:28
 if u watched that recent tax guy talk about bitcoin you should know if you get any pleasure from doin this you cant exactly deduct it from your tax.
@_date: 2013-03-09 11:41:33
Cheers imgur is better.
I agree I do think the italics is a bit phony.
I think using italics is a good way to ease in to a change of the logo, because there is already much blind love towards the current design.
Having some resemplance to current paying systems has its advantages because people will instantaneously recognized this visual quirks.
If you look at paypal, visa and mastercard they all tilt the logo or should i say italicize.
It is a visual mechanism I believe to communicate speed and moving forward but it also is, like i said a bit phony looking...
Linked is a revised version: 
@_date: 2013-03-17 07:38:56
the new bitcoin client is much faster than before be thankful of that at least.
agreed though it is a problem and it pushes people towards online wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:04:52
apparently as the price goes up more and more people spend them. look this up, its not that surprising really. people wana blow a little steam or just want blow.
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:14:55
got half way. this is seems really good for the technical stuff.

@_date: 2013-04-25 08:39:46
well im verified too and i cant take out more then a 1000 a day. i have to get  varified even further apparently. i suspect this is a Australian regulations so they can watch me and tax me or might have to do with probable use of bitcoin with narcotics.

fucking hell dude that address looks DODGE! the address is near fremental that could be graet from ozcoin. anyone confirm? EDIT just confirmed who is running it. shouldnt be a problem just small. probably need to communicate with people on ozcoin webIRC to get anything going on the exchange.
@_date: 2013-08-21 09:16:39
Yeah, sell a bit if it goes up a lot!
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:19:19
this is great advertising here... people should save this link and direct people to it that are interested in bitcoin.
pretty much the strongest point of bitcoin right here in a table of %s
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:11:45
i advice u to buy a large sum of bitcoin when u really feel like the price is right so u wont have to risk the volitility each time u wana to international transfers.
in others words stock up on bitcoin on the next dip.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:39:52
that is the first and second rule the third is to buy things with bitcoin as they rise.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:57:20
i find it hard to spend bitcoin if they are going up. the only way i would buy stuff with bitcoin is if the seller really reduces to BTC price to match the potential growth.
someone has to grow a pair and start selling cheaper.

@_date: 2013-11-29 02:52:04
actually i use coinjar. they are pretty good but only after u have set everything up and gone through the verification. you also need to keep depositing and trading because they put a limit on you in the beginning.
the shit thing is coinjar doesnt hold $. for example if u trade in to $ it goes straight to your bank accout, which u know takes a day or longer.
the limits are starting to get bad too, now that bitcoin has gone up. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:12:24
go bitcoin, of the grid man!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:47:35

as of right now things are very hard to predict. its not like before it going up so fast. its more steady it seems. but id advice just to buy a little bit first to get warmed up to it. your feelings will change once u have a few coins and u can buy more later or sooner.
just be comfortable with the fact that u could loss it
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:10:02
think about this; if most people use gox and most people dont live in japan it takes 2-3 days to wire cash over there. if you send it on monday look to thursday for action.
the people that have no fear and want to buy after the crash would of sent the cash during the weekends and should arrive today tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:54:15

@_date: 2013-10-07 21:46:43
yeah this seems like a great idea. have a similar thing to mining so people host nodes.
question is where does the money come from to pay of the nodes? and what about abuse. whats stopping small groups contributing most of the networking power creating a not so distributed network?
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:31:21
pfft the cell phones alright. if they fixed the phone and made it none expensive and not break when u drop it id be happy with it. i still think the phone could be taken further. you know in australia it costs over a lot just to connect this thing.

oh thank you. just think about it some more. i actually think even having a little bit of bitcoin is fun and also wise.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:42:21
too risky, unless you really know what you are doing.

hmm i have to agree. but when i was watching it really got me thinking it was very very strange for me.
a lot of emotions start coming at you but at the end of the day for the people that dont have much money the emotions are so strong u cant look any further.

lol so if people dont spend bitcoin that the value goes up. i wonder if u factor in people that buy bitcoin and cash out.

you really need to beat coinjar. right now they are cheaper.
potential arbitrage but hard to tell with this site.
i welcome the competition.

can be used to by pass western union and banks and for overseas workers sending cash back home could maybe do it more economically. (unstable price still an issue but might be preferable risk compared to other options or no options)
also bitcoin in fact could offer more stability and safety than local currencies.
bitcoin makes for easier entry to the online market world because there is not bs bank, gov, regulation or company body to stop or siphon anything.
it has been discussed before that bitcoin can be small countries currency, i dont see why not.
biggest point would be donations, because bitcoin has no fat you can send tiny donations of 50 cents (because there is hardly a fee). the middle man is cut out and once bitcoin gets super user friendly sending micro transactions such as 50 cents would be normal.
bitcoin can be more durable than what 3rd world countries are using (paper) in the long run running on bitcoin would be more economical and would obviously last much longer than paper.

@_date: 2013-04-15 10:38:36
hmm u suppose it would be a nightmare for them to set such a thing up. but the whole value of there own bitcoin would be banked by the banks themselves and government. people are too sacred to trust anyone else still. so this is what im guessing could happen.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:27:29
omg who gives a fuck if they are mining. you need the general population to be involved. that is numbers!

the way i think of it is. if people are saving and people are hoarding yes they are holding wealth back but down the line some way some how they are going to have to spend it on something and so it pays off down the line.
people saving will eventually put larger sums out. got to release the pressure someday.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:42:57
lol... bl...

god man u dont even know ok!
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:33:10
i think thats the next thing. systems that pretty much convert straight away in to another currency to avoid fall outs like that.
a good system would be as follow; joe makes some USD and wants to send it to africa. the new system requires him to go online where his hard earned USD is converted in to bitcoin and in a split second it is on mums account converted back in to USD or watever currency.
to me that doesnt seem hard. just need some big dog with a pool of bitcoin and some contacts that hold different currencies.
maybe all the converting will be less expensive or more, i dont know. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:19:22
hmm i dont know if you will find anyone selling. im certainly not selling at anywhere near 110. despeit what market rates say they are worth more. the fact that they are so hard to get is one reason why the price is high.

lol when gox had trouble last week i tried to withdraw some bitcoins in to a wallet and it took 12h that pissed me off but really when u look at a 3 day and as u said up to 6 day transfer 12 hours is lighting. current banking is floored and so obviously so, most people just dont see it because they dont really take to time to link the dots.
why is everyone else so fast but money.

Actually this is a really good idea for any game.
I'm more of a competitive gamer and so I would like to see people play games for money even. Maybe a starcraft 2 mod where you can pay .1 bitcoin to join a pool of players and whoever wins out of the lot gets all the coin at the end.
Or simply have one on one games where both you and your opponent put in cash and winner takes all.
cheating would become business but only playing with trusted players would be fair.

Yeah, I was going to go ahead and test the waters here first and just get a general feeling of what other people are thinking about the current.
I'm expecting a lot of people to appose the idea of a redesign.
It has been a few months now and I still have not gotten used to the current logo and I retain me initial reaction of the logo which is mistrust.
At the end of the day I think the technology is going to succeed with a crummy logo or not so for most part this doesn't matter. But as a designer I do notice these things.

they didnt destroy the money because that just made everyone richer. also you cant create new wealth because it pretty much devalues everything or takes value from something else.
if we can keep creating wealth over and over, which if u think about it every single humen being is pretty much trying to do there would never end and thing would essentially become worthless.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:01:21
sign of aging.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:25:28
it be soo dumb to fight bitcoin. any modern company/industries has to learn up and get with the times.
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:18:47
Shut up and use it!
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:08:58
lol, keep me updated please.
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:56:08
did u read it?
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:46:08
1% seems reasonable but i did notice it is a limited time offer. so what? going back to old fees?
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:37:41
weird... trust me these are hard times... everyone is flat out busy, panic mod and rich and poor all at the same time. just keep plugging away send an email. it took me 5 days to get a reply back from mtgox recently and it was obviously some japanse person because it had some grammar mistakes in the email. but watever, just as long the bitcoin isnt gone.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:23:40
if it goes up fast its bad because lots of noob are in to it and they just sell and loss money and fuck thing up.
if it goes up gradually we are safe. right now it feels somewhat safe.
for what will happen to the price in a few years its too hard to tell.
somedays im like fuck ya no worries it will be a lot. somedays im like there are too many dumb people it wont work cause they simply cant understand it.
good news it there is a lot of good news. ive been watching the reddit thread and anything with bitcoin and it does seem to be growing.
bitcoin in its nature is going to be up and down so once u get over that its no big deal.
@_date: 2013-07-05 08:16:44
looks good but i dont know how to use it yet all i see is a list of unknown files.
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:10:04
i feel really cool ay
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:08:52
ah, interesting. i always like hearing australian on the ground stories.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:51:42
damn man...!
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:02:37
hmm at this rate by the end of the year there will be too many place to list that accept it.
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:12:38
no harm in competition mofo
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:49:15
CNN is getting more and more positive about btc, reluctantly so
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:54:09
yeah good point i guess. liquidity.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:34:10
father of the year!
@_date: 2013-10-10 11:30:49
god i wana smash someone for this
@_date: 2013-07-18 06:36:39
thanks for clarifying. u should do a TLDR.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:00:45
OMG thats slow!!.. they need a 2 floors of workers on it at least. i bet u they only have a medium size office of part of a floor.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:53:33
give me a break man... if u get it early your safe, i looked in to it last december and i realized i wouldnt get it till its too late.
@_date: 2013-07-03 08:24:58
why would u use a ° degree symbol.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:41:08
for non starcraft players this is the biggest amount of money ever for a starcraft 2 showmatch. unfortunately most people on teamliquid pretty backwards. might need a few more btc funded sc2 events, before it sinks in.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:37:36
it would still work, just look at silk road. it would take a huge hit but it will survive or another version out. just be napster story all over again.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:16:19
im up voting because i want criticism on this. making a far out predictions like this puts ya on the spot.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:24:31
yeah to bad its the weekends and to bad it takes days just to wire money. i would like to buy just a few coins right now but its just annoying using banks....
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:14:14
yeah kind of, i feel like we need some real big boy tech heads using bitcoin. bill gates, facebook dude, wiki dude, some google guyz maybe some mac dudes./
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:01:51
if you are new then just get with it. bitcoin is unstable because its new and unregulated. if you are a short time thinker than the  lows are going to hurt you but if you are long term and like the technology the price fluctuations are no big deal.
once u do a bit of research and if you understand and like what bitcoin is you wont be upset about the price.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:52:35
can more nerds look a this.
i think outside services (bitpay) fix the volatility of bitcoin.
the great thing about volatility is that its honest. we can see everything going on and its fascinating.
@_date: 2013-07-18 09:02:00
id say what is this tron or something.
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:18:32
really cool vid and place.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:26:45
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:55:46
lol u sold them!
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:05:31
golds taking a beating these days. so dont know why!
@_date: 2013-03-09 12:09:19
Yeah you are right. I have not put in the time to fine tune it. But overtime I'll have no problems getting this done and more ideas perhaps.
Just unsure if it is a waste of my time or not. I was expecting more people to talk up about this.
 Yeah, I do overall like the current font (minus the tilt) but it does look a little bit weak. I'm more leaning towards the heavy solid set look.
But I think I will experiment more with the type. Such as your suggestions. I have to admit I like the american express logo in many ways, it bleeds off the square which I think it rarely used in money related identity. It also has a strong heavy feel. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:39:17
man seems strong around 90-110. lol in real stock or currency terms that is insanely unstable but in bitcoin thats calm
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:25:27
all i can say is DISGUSTING!....
to me this is worse than murder because the damage it does is immeasurable.
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:11:50
WOW! 22560? picture that line... still backed up.
Still doesnt make sense the price is still low imo. maybe a lot of people just sitting and watching and to scared join.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:24:36
dude i wish wish wish we change to that symbol. if we had that symbol people wouldnt have panic sold. it is easier to hold bitcoin when it looks strong.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:23:15
first thing i noticed was the fee.... well its a start i guess. massive room for a competitor!
@_date: 2013-06-23 14:41:30
if its for drugs u gona have to work out how you going to safely get it mailed or you will get nailed.
to your questions just say its for an investment.
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:06:48
that be true my friend that be true
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:19:56
thats a huge list but would like a clickable category section at top so u dont have to scroll down while damaging the eyes.
@_date: 2013-05-18 07:47:10
yeah! its the future.......
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:54:32
yeah its gona happen. simpsons is one step forward!
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:02:15
haha! thats pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:39:25
this should be a feature for everything
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:43:40
you and many others.
its nice and warm feeling.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:06:52
great find. restore some logic and faith back in.!!!
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:57:48
i dont really get it mind you i didnt read to deeply in to it. someone else further dumb it down for me.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:55:02
not to bad here but def cant do good trading yet.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:32:10
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:52:06
hmm, simple. i like the logic. i have to admit while it was going up i didnt really have anything in mind to buy. but next time ill get a few things. i think this is sound advice.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:48:14
well keep posting and keep contributing because your account new. if you start building up your rep on here, tis only way to get some respect yo.
@_date: 2013-06-07 06:01:24
watched the first part and seemed pretty damn positive...
@_date: 2013-07-01 15:43:16
yeah i missed it or he didnt mention it. i live in o-stratlia so its a bit far 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:00:11
yeah, thats what i thought 2nd market was for.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:55:33
feels shady only because u havent got a big gov controling it and putting a stamp on it. its shady because the current design and graphic is rubbish.
once thing start to settle and infrastructure gets in place more money will be pumped in and overall better image will arise.
this is just a side effect of having an underground thing emerge.
just think of some music that arose and even art or the cell phone. on first arrival these new things are a freak show.
you have to provide identity now because one of the biggest things about bitcoin is u can do some natughty things with it. but hell give me a suit case of cold hard cash and id do naughty things with that too.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:20:44
if i told you how much i held and how much i could of cashed out u wouldn't believe it. bitcoin is pretty unique and the price is well pricless
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:34:48
i saw some cum in the back seat....
id still buy it.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:08:46
god when is this coming out... looks perfect!
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:28:34
emas are estimated moving averages i think
blue is sell and orange is buy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:07:28
o ok ill have a look in to that.
Iam talking about transferring away from gox
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:05:42
NICE! 
@_date: 2013-07-27 19:50:53
but as mentioned by swordfish if you wana use coins for naughty stuff you might wana mix the bitcoins around the place.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:31:40
u should get on an exchange then. its really really long and hard now but best bet is to go with smaller exchange, mtgox is backed up. but i do believe maybe u can still put money in and buy but they limit u in someway if u arent verified or something. i think u cant take it out if u arent varifed but u can buy and put in cash.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:43:05
it isnt a bad news report at all. that lady speaking seemed pretty switched on, she knows what this technology means us.
@_date: 2013-05-25 07:28:01
god man i want an atari with with that many games...
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:42:38
It is trivial because i think the Bitcoin will succeed regardless, but communication is important.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:32:20
politely ask and if doesnt happen move to better phone.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:52:45
i dont know what offchan tracscations are or mixing?
might need 5 year old version explanation for safety
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:38:44
i wonder how much energy is used by the people that manage all the dollar bills that have there whole life in it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:55:19
it works with wealth as well.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:19:37
Oh man so this is the source of the graphical problem....
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:47:24
that large of a sum only in exchanges. but you probably will have some bitcoin nerds out there that will do it u just need to keep shopping around. its gona be hard but if u wana be off the grid u have to take the time to do it right.
@_date: 2013-06-14 03:59:17
Another one bites the dust!
@_date: 2013-10-02 15:41:43
LOL really?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:14:06
what, u r too good for drones now?
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:14:44
a lot of people use this quote inline with bitcoin did u know.
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:26:01
snark pit
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:30:25
same here
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:51:20
This is what i sent once:
If you guys accept bitcoin you will:
1. tap in to a generous user base of the technology (you will see people already giving bitcoin to each other for comments on redit, called tips)
2. speed up money transfers and less fees also, plus huge sums of money will be less drama
3. bitcoin is not controlled by any bank or government
4. bitcoin price is rising (bitcoin obtained now can potentially be worth way more)
5. supporting a free innovative technology, not unlike kickstart
Sticking it at 5 points, but i think its in kickstarts best interest use this easy flow of money technology.
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:17:57
haha agreed. people like day trading because its like a game and like gambling.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:15:54
Thanks Miller. Thought u were a bit of tool to begin with but changed my mind pretty quickly.
Lets make BTC happen.
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:13:43
what another pub???
another bites the dust!!!
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:00:58
let the man do his thing
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:27:44
hmm wow... good news i think. so how much are u going to buy? are u going to day trade, sit on it, or buy stuff with it or what? are u a spartan?
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:42:43
isnt doing great but it isnt doing bad.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:51:55
wtf u talking about. are u plugging.?
@_date: 2013-03-09 11:30:16
I have to say the current double vertical line B has a few negative connotations and if we ever want more global acceptance of Bitcoin it should not look like some sort of gangsta, blinged out mula.
1. The current logo looks cheap and my first impression of it before understanding Bitcoin was that it was a fake currency. (it seriously just doesn't look legit)
2. It bares a strong resemblance to $ which is the old system and I dont see why we should stay with this.
3. B is already more heavy and so placing 2 horizontal lines makes it look over done. S, Y, C are very light in comparison and striking lines through these works.
4. Bitcoin is very fast! and currently it doesn't communicate that. It should bare some resemblance to technology.
I'd like more people to reconsider now what we are accepting know as the identity for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:39:20
pretty cool even if some of these places are pretty shanty. makes me wana buy one and renovate.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:10:50

good job elux!
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:32:50
why the fuck is everything on him deleted???
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:03:50
screw u dude i got so much fiat waiting for this
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:35:32
coinbase is american though? im down under.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:34:47
totally agree. make some native African friends for god sakes.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:49:12
wow that guy talking about bitcoin was frosty man!
@_date: 2013-12-28 12:28:31
rigged the whole world is rigged!
change is coming!
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:58:35
hmm i didnt understand what his idea was. sounded like a money/time currency with computing power on the large cloud computing websites.
anyone care to explain it because it sounded really different to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:19:22
i found the thread but i have not read through it. report back.
@_date: 2013-07-02 11:39:57
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:11:25
id kind of like bitcoin reddit not to be about price. its stressing too many people out.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:02:35
god i wish i had some food right now.
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:22:56
oh i see its just so its code to set up a site. pretty cool ay!
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:49:13
man she got trashed for talking about bitcoin imo and its a reactions when you cant explain 100%.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:17:06
kind of looks like 111 is the lowest
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:38:43
seems to be better. give it a few more days...
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:15:42
Try this! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:42:37
my god... the comments run so deep, it just keeps scrolling down and down and down. i remember when btc was in the news it would have a few negative comments and forgotten.
200k shares as well. network effect has begun!
keep the news flowing bad and good.
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:17:55
give me a break u stupido
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:22:25
could be a troll...
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:29:41
finally, they were falling behind.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:38:10
this! i hate to regulate but its hard to get good information now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:44:02
fortune favors the bold!
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:26:40
dude think long term. anyone that puts money in to a stock sometimes waits 10-15 years...
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:25:25
if u serious just take the time with bitpay
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:16:36
good job.
I got the feeling she wanted it explained like she was 5. A lot of what she heard probably went over her head.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:45:59
id like to see this. i havent seen a example how this actually works. i get the time stamp but what about the files u upload?
@_date: 2013-06-11 10:56:59
spent some time looking in to this. i think this would be a very cool step for introducing people to bitcoin and would be fun to watch.
i really hope it gets filmed
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:13:42
yes i feel the same way. if more and more people feel this way its a sign of people really staying long and true to bitcoin and want to see it used and implemented in to daily life.
good type of people to have on board with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:42:00
yeah. its massive!
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:13:03
i dont know if it will be a massive currency like a dollar but maybe a small percentage of the world currency. a small cut of the world is still great though. if u have money people will part with bitcoin u just got to pay a little extra.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:09:39
its very funny cause you are right. but every time the price goes down people buy more so what does that say??
the value is a bit unbelivable so people dont buy until it goes down and that brings it to a new high and we keep finding new values but its still hard to say what the real new value is.
i think we are going to see this ride a few times.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:21:43
i did some more research and you seem rather knowledgeable with the backup.
its ok you work on parseltongue.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:59:32
doesnt matter. its a feeling. u can do a bit of research by searching the "wealth is never destroyed merely transferred"
its not a pure fact or science like energy but it has a ton of merit.
if no one had money but needed to trade, somebody will come up with something everyone wants, that somebody has all the value in the world. people want it so they trade with whatever he wants and all the value he had is suddenly distributed.
and thus the value is set and begins its transfer forever and ever, amen.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:55:02
i just photoshoped the utility bill.
pay a graphic designer to do this.
anyone need forgery contact me ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:04:30
all i read is some unintelligent people saying its not good. mostly non techies i suppose. well we will see what happens.
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:42:07
bit expensive....
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:36:09
lol none. all the makers of these mining rigs are still very very new, slow and experimental.
the mining rigs are often preordered and if you order now it will take god knows how long for you to get it and by that time difficulty will be high.
if you really want to mine you should invest a lot of money in to it, it is just like mining gold or other stuff the more money u put in the better the chances of it working. otherwise its just a huge waste of time, energy and money.
@_date: 2013-06-27 07:34:05
ill stretch u if u dont watch it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:16:53
Put me in there:
And there was Bitcoin and it was good.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:26:01
ive talked about this in the past: 
Most of the older users actually really love the current identity and so its very hard to get any movement on this issue.
Ƀ is the way to go its very unique and actually looks like bitcoin if you can say that.
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:54:38
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:35:58
actually i see one black in the top right hand corner. the photo cuts him off slightly.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:00:05
id use this straight away
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:04:28
yeah lighten up! drink a little beer and let the bit flow.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:20:18
in Australia they have been on the news and all but not good.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:24:03
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:57:53
thanks a bit better. but when i click on the places they have no detail of where they are exactly
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:43:49
yeah, i read somewhere that anonymity of bitcoin might be not so anonymous with time. but i still think by using tor, proxy and vpns it would be very hard to track people down doing shady stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:23:04
this is classic. to bad about bitspend.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:37:04
finally a face and image of mtgox. like he said though anything could happen. the people have the right to take everything out if they want.
but hell 5-20 mill a day going in? thats like 150-600  mill a month!!!! that fucking Japanese bank working with gox must be making a killing on transaction costs alone.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:52:30
shut up your mouth
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:39:08
cheers, this is true.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:13:58
man just show me something
@_date: 2013-03-25 10:35:31
o ok thanks
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:26:11
dude just check yourself. i know it there it was posted.
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:39:50
did seem sort of weird. why the fuck would they let bitcoin happen but not allowed to use it by anyone. how the hell u gona control that anyway.
makes more sense to let people speculate on it and use it at there own risk. gov sees how it goes and makes further discussion after the fact.
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:22:31
so funny i love it!
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:07:28
if u wana be a day trader u better have deep pockets for that, u will probably loss more then u gain. otherwise just sit and grin, money will roll right in.
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:34:37

hmm its totally shit for someone that has no understanding and is unopen minded. but you know these coins could be potentially worth way way more so that stupid waiter that throws that stupid piece of paper is going to feel pretty god damn stupid when only a short time down the road its worth 10 times more.
moral of the story, dumb, tired and overworked people do dumb things.

Lol thats what i thought but figured uber nicky would of indulged beyond a latte the fairy
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:09:05
not going to lie, its a pain in the ass, but its not much different from obtaining other rare commodites or money itself. try looking for money, its not going to be easy.
people place different values on bitcoin. some value it and dont wana sell some are short term and wana sell now (for a price) but once these services iron out i think it will get easier.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:40:13

500 is safe but considering what you said, being in for an experiment and having the flexibility and all id honestly just put all in now if you have the choice. if it goes down dont worry and dont sell because u still bought cheap imo.

@_date: 2013-04-24 16:28:58
i thought u said u sell it and take it out of the exchange. i know everyone says to take everything out of gox but if you take everything out and you want to buy at a good time example being a drop you cant because u took everything out of gox. thats what i mean. i think what you are doing is really safe.
guess u got to risk a bit to get a bit.

ahh so u are not staying in korea. that is fine buddy!
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:34:04
god man dont worry about what people are saying. i know how it is if u buy at this high price.
a lot of people here are sitting happy because they were lucky and have a few coin laying around for watever reason. maybe they bought a few at 30 and there isnt anything much to buy with bitcoin so they sat on it made a lot and now say they are emotional disconnected from it
well its easy to be emotional disconnected when you are already in the clear and not lossing anything.
i get the post but it might need to shorter and sweeter.

god damn taiwan could play a bigger role here. come on Taiwanese people get a little smarter
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:25:23
fair fears id say... if you are in the USA u can use bitspend to buy anything with bitcoin, so consider that.
buying bitcoin i admit could be easier but i think this will get easier as time goes on. the quickest way might be just to buy of people that a willing to part with the coin.
security is an issue if u do online banking also. so if you play safe with online banking u can probably work a wallet safely as well. just keep majority of money offline and make a another wallet for your cash u wana spend.
just having a few bitcoin is not only fun and exciting but they can be used to buy stuff if u look around. it might grow or it might not, but try and enjoy it thats my advice.
its razor edge!
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:29:47
dude! id much rather not have every bloody thing recorded, i kind of like not being surveillanced.'
you do realize that people are already retarded checking there phones all the time. guess whats going to happen when people get over how crap they look. people will be hooked up to that thing all the god damn time.
im not saying it shouldnt happen, im all for it, bring it on but its def not going to be something i like. ill find something useful to do with it but im pretty skeptical about it at this time.
when they actually make the google glass look none retarded maybe people will use it.
if i see someone use one of these id tell them to take that thing off and not record or take my picture thanks.

If i put bitcoin in to bips and i travel to japan does the site convert bitcoin in to yen and somehow i get that?
@_date: 2013-05-25 06:27:05
do it in tech areas or rich busy people that have some bitcoin id say.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:54:33
that will be true!
@_date: 2013-06-24 08:00:50
basically says nothings going to happen until it gets bigger, but be aware that transferring money to gox or exchanges via your bank is still traceable.
just dont exchange back in to $ unless its done in person.

if you can explain it in 1 sentence and then if they show interest follow it with a 2nd sentence explaining it, its fine.
I find it hard getting to the 2nd sentence though.
I'll leave the explanations to the beautiful and charismatic.

it is also somewhat of a neutral piece which I'm surprised about.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:11:26
take out too much and put it in your bank u will have goverment watching your cash... ready to tax the shit out of it.

Man, I like Jeff Berwick. I feel like he is doing a good job talking about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:28:47
omg give me a god damn break. if the chinese really actually understood and knew about it we would obviously be in a different place right now. dont you guys know that they have a censored internet and that most Chinese people live in there own god damn world in china and its freaking massive!!!! trust me 1-2-3 even a 100 sites talking about bitcoin in chinese is soo freaking little they will need 1-2 maybe 3 years for the population to catch up and learn about it. thats how censored it is there.
when i was living there most a lot of people hadnt even seen or spoken to a white person. and still the majority of the population is really really old school.
if anyone knows someone that is chinese and that can translate well get them to do it this will be the only way.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:31:38
I made a post about 1 week or more ago about this 
I still think the horizontal line (intersecting or not) is much more unique 
c-r-u-x and I have discussed the tilt/italics style previously and we both agreed that it was a dated and a trivial detail.
The current design and options out there are too fancy and communicate the wrong kind of message (bling and greed are some key words)
Another thing I never mentioned in my original post was the weak font we currently use. I don't think a medium or regular type is good enough, instead bold or heavy is much more appropriate for a financial logo.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:04:06
we need something like this for people thinking about day trading. at the moment that is the biggest reason we have swings, this and people trying to jump boat each time it gets high. if people are more educated about bitcoin in regards to price and rise we might see less panic attacks.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:18:47
yeah soon as i saw this i thought damn i wouldnt mind one at the right price. quickly sell sell sell!

nice site overall but at first glance there is a lot of text and information that made me wana bail. luckily i know what backing up is so that calmed me back down.
hope bitcoin treats u well.
@_date: 2013-10-05 09:06:19
also cant access the site... any news? there needs to be a just-dice reddit now i think.
i just made a justdice subreddit (r/justdice).

hard to read a wall of text like this. but the last paragraph goes in to pushing HK people to make apps for bitcoin. this is a good idea because the asian languages are not going to be able to pick up on all the good english resources for bitcoin.

god u lucky bastard

wow thats a brilliant idea......!! upvote this!
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:32:02
this is true, all it takes it time to set up and you arent taking any real risk. you can take a risk and hold some bitcoin, it probably will go up (who knows) or you can play it say and convert with bitpay system.
accepting bitcoin is a sign that a company/business is forward thinking.

this is true. if they are smart they would do this. i watched or read somewhere that they do take risks and move quickly but i feel like they might miss the boat with this one at least for a very very long time.
i dont know why. maybe because i havent seen facebook do anything good for a very very long time. slowing down and making the wrong moves now i feel.
i also dont trust them, im not the only one that feel that way.

give me a break man! bitcoin, if you put in the effort can be used for coke too u know. maybe later in the future that could change, but for now its a mind fuck tracing anyone doing anything with bitcoin.
try putting your savings in a bank. they lock it and u cant touch it or you wont get interest, bitcoin is so different its like funny u compare it so easily to a bank etc.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:22:09

i like this app. im glad to see the improvements on it. im still curious if the app has gone through a rigourse bug and hack beating just so we know its secure enough to handle really really big amounts of btc.
anyone tried hacking it??? im still a little afraid to use the app for large amounts of btc on my phone.
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:23:14
o yeah i read about this, its a good start. I'd like to see bitcoin used in more competitive games.
@_date: 2013-10-14 23:09:11
exactly what i thought
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:03:18
perfect. bookmarked and will most likely order a fuck ton. are these really tough chewing jerky or are they more less soft. im much more in to the real tough jerky.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:53:31
yeah this is just the same pub i saw a few days ago. but still seems to be a lot of news about people accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-12 16:17:00
man why did u fap... thats kind of trollish
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:22:25
ive come to the same conclusion. like lebrontourage commented it might fall a bit or hang around 200 for awhile.
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:08:16
yeah, probably. i read it as inconclusive but highly likely a bug a client. but come on it is very interesting.!
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:29:53
i ended up canceling my withdraw. it took i think over a month and couldnt wait anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:03:46
you r right.
but this is the point im trying to make.
you give the example that if bitcoin fails tomorrow some will cash out and become extremely wealthy whilst the others will be poorer. this is exactly what i mean the wealth transfer.
I originally wanted to make the point that bitcoin is not necessarily creating new millionaires and billionaires its essentially a transfer.
I dont know if bitcoin is making the poor poorer or the rich less rich. I like to think btc is gaining its value because all other currencies are falling. btc is essentially picking up what is lost everyday from the devalued fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:37:55
man the winks had the idea for facebook and now they see a another idea with btc. they arent just some jocks after all.
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:15:25
had the same idea. no idea why this is no implemented. i would use this. all bitcoin wallets and storage places need this pronto.
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:33:38
watching this makes me realize what a waste it is using current paper cash. so inefficient.
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:42:19

@_date: 2013-04-13 11:42:38

@_date: 2013-11-12 18:12:29
sounds like a tool which has value but ultimately at some point someone will buy it or the app is going to make some money and thats where the value is going to show.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:09:21
did he just say bitcom?
@_date: 2013-10-16 09:55:08
this true. cant count the times ive had to read the same explanation.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:46:31
sounds good. i want to move forward. let the bit flow.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:51:51
lol... troll?
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:57:32
such important information and mtgox doesnt even explain it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:42:24
false! your mumma
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:22:08
they will work together likely. they both are pretty nice to 'hold'
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:20:43
i agree with u
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:06:42
yep kodak moment coming up
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:40:34
i agree i think it is here to stay for a long time. i think there will be services using bitcoin such as ripple which helps and coexists well together possibly.
also got to note how bitcoin is getting really intrenched now. rebuilding a whole new blockchain, public faith and trust, value and software all over again is going to be hard. i think its more profitable for people to build on to bitcoin think of ideas to make bitcoin more useful and offers services implementing bitcoin.
if someway somehow they can make bitcoin more user friendly, easier to get and change the fucking clip art logo bitcoin might have an even more solid footing.
@_date: 2013-05-31 07:07:41
ok btc6000 stay intouch.
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:49:17
i love u man...
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:18:20
this is a bit concerning no? can the bitcoin foundation assert suggest more distribution even if its just a slight.
maybe BTC guild could take the lead on this and somehow distribute pools.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:19:07
bargain price!
@_date: 2013-09-23 07:20:23
cool vid!
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:45:30
not a bad piece 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:42:45
everyones bagging dogecoins but they are missing the point. the market wants something like this.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:32:12
oh i see. well the verification thing isnt too important than i was under the impression that this was holding back money but it isnt really right? dont know...
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:59:31
thanks man. best of luck.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:52:23
id like to know this one as well.
Why are u in japan, explain...
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:18:08
dude if your account got hacked there is a high chance your computer systems have viruses, spyware, Trojans and keyloggers.
you might want to totally start afresh.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:39:32
fucking idiots should of made something like this ages ago.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:34:06
hmm true... is it just a matter of computing power and network power? i mean how much money would it take to stop having these issues? what does mtgox need to buy/hire to get this done.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:31:26
we should do something along the lines as the magic internet money wizard.
maybe something like a 90s themed style ad a lot like this 
i dont want bitcoin to appear like some company or business. it should be presented as something that is around no matter what.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:08:30
bs that map i cant zoom in and it has no details. all look phony to me.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:56:04
wow dude... just buy in again because if you are keeping track there is a good chance it still going to go up.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:18:12
all i see is more people mining bitcoin who want to probably sell it and might reduce the price. i think there are a lot of miners who have a fuck ton of bitcoin and for watever reason a whole group of them want to sell it will bring the price down
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:55:52
this worries me:
"But, in the future it won’t be surprising to see Amazon promote the product as an easy way for account holders and merchants to send each other money. Similarly, we could see a bank, or group of banks launching a low cost P2P network for their clients."
Because bitcoin is open source would it not be easy for a few of the big banks, visa, master and amazon ebay all to agree to using there own P2P currency using bitcoin technology... if they someone agreed it will be an oligopoly and they could all agree to a lower transactions fee but still control everything as it is.
maybe if they did create there own it is still better than what we have and getting on board early would be intelligent.
despite what people say about these big banks and companies they arent stupid. i think they realize that its stupid to try and kill bitcoin, its just easier to make there own. the code/technology free!!
Edit: i realize bitcoin is has its foot in the door already, but it has not won the trust of regular folk. having your 'trusty' visa card turn in to a bitcoin card (mind you it wont be obvious) will be pretty easy for them to do... can please debate this with me&gt;?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:21:55

hey guys i missed on on the ripple give out can someone send me some ripple rUuJXHsNQHPeJjLNTWYYLszp6y6dryGKHe
@_date: 2013-03-24 11:22:23
sounds good...
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:59:50
well sometimes they can offer no ads for while watching the stream and for players that play a lot and give significant entertainment bitcoin is a good way to keep them playing.
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:52:02
yep but this feel different
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:23:20
just hold u fool, you are making it unstable for everyone else.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:50:47
WOW... that really put things in to perspective... 
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:40:16
brave, beautiful and stupid at the same time.
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:49:33
just sit and grin, money will roll right in.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:30:10
lol yeah fail logic greenspan
@_date: 2013-09-07 22:04:20
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:52:15
much wealth
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:03:11
smarter just to buy a few coins. getting in to mining is really really fuzzy now.
the only people that are really getting in to mining are the ones that did it early who got some early coin and now using the early coin to buy even bigger mining rigs.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:38:03
fark seriously. there is so much people saying just to hold. why did u do this.
@_date: 2013-10-04 09:15:56
he mentions trading volume. can bitcoin handle such large trading volume?
also what would be the 3 top things to stop btc from succeeding? 
my ideas:
1. super regulated/banned in most countries (but if there was only a few it still would work, no?)
2. alternative superior protocol
3. some how hacked
a lot of these situations are out of our control. if we could make btc protocol better how could we do that?
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:36:25
hmm its hard to say if that is too much. i view my bitcoin has worth a lot more than what everyone else is valuing it.
guess how many people are having trouble buying bitcoin, now that is a value in itself.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:23:59
US has a few options... I dont live in US but I have read many people talk about this... dig a little deeper!
@_date: 2013-03-17 07:34:07
i kind of feel like this guy right now
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:19:16
well i hear that paypal has a never ending fight with customers already. putting bitcoin in to paypal now might be a bit early.
maybe an example would be email. once everyone know what the @ sign ment and knew where to place it thats when moving in to email is profitable. think gmail hotmail etc.
maybe bitcoin just needs a little more clearity. people are still arguing its not a currency and not like gold. eventually everyones minds will get that its both and both is possible.
@_date: 2013-03-10 08:20:10
I agree. The whole thing looks a little bit cheap and fake. But everyone seems to like it. It shows that people still like the feeling of real coin, money, gold.
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:35:34
i thought it was pretty good
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:55:46
$0.15 @_date: 2013-05-04 23:39:01
too old too left behind its not the 90s anymore get with it.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:08:47
i had to study it for 2 months before i was fully on board.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:51:43
not a lot of information but im taking a risk and spending time on an application.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:07:56
do you know who made the MS Paint Wizard ad?
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:56:57
yeah true... no you do not but your visa wont last long u will have to do a visa run.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:19:30
hmm yeah not allowed to use this area as a market. markets get really really messy.
id sell you a tiny bit but there is just soo much problems of how you would pay. im not risking it.
how much is escrow? we need something so uncomplicated and free so randoms can do these things.
@_date: 2013-05-04 03:15:14
That coworker just sounds like a lucky loser, forget him.
I think you need to change your approach to bitcoin. I have been burned also. I could of sold at a very high price but i wanted to hold because i thought bitcoin was awesome. I also didnt realize how many noobs and speculators there were in on the game.
now i think a better strategy is to buy stuff when the price rises and save them when it drops. Also buy in the dips and only sell tiny bits on quick rises.
buying on the rise supports bitcoin merchants but you also protect yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:55:04
lol it says the shares went up over 100% after the news. wonder if that means people that dont know how to get bitcoin just buy these shares instead.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:44:33
can u update us if there is any random deposits made? i wonder if this will catch on if it works.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:55:57
duh, but there isn't enough coverage of it in Chinese stupid
@_date: 2013-05-19 02:37:32
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:22:23
what about some guys dude!!! u will make more that way@
@_date: 2013-05-26 11:28:49
man even back in the day people knew wtf was going on
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:05:06
FINALLY logic!
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:33:16
im going to take that coin mofo! sellers beware!
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:09:34
perth is very very very expensive now because of fucking miners making money brining up the price. that and aus put all cash in to house and make bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:52:55
i really wish i could do this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:38:39
yeah the site is very neat.
can anyone tell me if 2.5% withdraw fee is a lot? compare it to exchanging currency in person what is the difference in price.
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:44:40
that was great!
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:18:23
people give a lot of info on facebook, no?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:02:04
well if u been reading the news there is 9000 people in que for mtgox and im guessing they mostly want to buy. so wait for the bubble to pop when there isnt such a long line just to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:32:24
totally i agree. it was expensive then and its fucking over priced now.
they should honestly give back some of the bitcoin to the people that gave them funding so early on.
if we look at % they probably profited much much more than anyone would of expected.
share success mofos share.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:54:08
hmm im same and i think many many more people are on the way. i sort of understand what daytraders, business freaks and stock market people are like now. money consumes but its even worse with bitcoin because it moves like nothing else out there.
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:19:07
what a legend@
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:15:53
its a bit of a personal question but my first buy in was about $500 at about 30, that was really scary lol man humens dont know shit about shit ay.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:25:39
wow your family said that. your a fool?
man im sorry to hear that...
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:10:03
if u wana take out 10k euro you have to wait. the limit is like 1000 day roughly so give and take a bit.
this sucks i know but the first thing u have to deal with is; shit takes forever with banks and fiat but bitcoin is much much quicker.
nothing new.
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:44:44
high risk high reward. if u can take the loses do it all at once. if u cant imagine lossing it all then do it bit by bit.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:06:36
i read it as bitcoinbeggars LOL!!!
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:01:57
horrible. very sorry.
hopefully they will contact u though and u get it back 
@_date: 2013-05-28 13:28:29
man that thing looks fattening
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:47:53
this should be the number one site to direct new people to
@_date: 2013-09-07 22:12:35
All you need to say to the CEO is 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:13:53
wow i half understood this but it sounds amazing!
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:30:04
translate the site in to lots of languages and it will be golden.
@_date: 2013-06-12 13:44:44
looks like a few things on it already. hope people start funding things.
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:25:08
lol does look like the price chart
@_date: 2013-03-16 09:23:36
this is a good explanation and helps me understand a lot about how this works.
@_date: 2013-07-01 07:28:50
I'm disgusted by the face control crap.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:09:41
lol he just did say bitcom!!
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:38:07
god man i wish i could throw money around like a king pin on the streets of LA!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:09:31
im verified but why dont they just set the limit to 10000 anyway...
isnt that the whole point of getting verified?
@_date: 2013-11-03 08:07:46
looks warm
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:14:10
 man are u sure...
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:50:51
yeah well we need this to be more obvious to people. that they dont have to play in the uncertainty they can just use bitcoin as a vechical. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:42:35
oh please!!!!!
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:45:56
are u living in korea? Ill be there next year for long term and will need to exchange bitcoin in to KRW. we can stay in touch till then.
as for right now i cant really help.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:42:43
ill buy if your selling
@_date: 2013-07-03 08:11:02
what do they offer different from all the other online wallet services?
@_date: 2013-07-27 21:47:20
sadly Colombia is pretty much stereotyped as cocaine world in international eyes.
its ok us Australians are stereotyped as dumb drunks. wat u gona do?
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:45:44
just use bitspend
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:39:30
buck ya!!!
@_date: 2013-06-27 06:20:31
This is a good idea. I'm guessing there are a lot of people that would rather talk to someone and have them physically show them the steps instead of researching it themselves.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:45:00
i think so but u know that sort of information is probably secret. i would imagine some of the btc would of been saved.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:07:01
hurry up israel make things happen for once.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:07:21
i thought it was russian
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:06:01
i like to think of it as "some lone genius sitting in a basement that accidentally changed the world"
lets face it.... u snooze u loss.
@_date: 2013-07-16 10:02:43
cant take this seriously until they hire a designer.
talk about stingy looking.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:00:13
lol she has 10k viewers i think mostly because of the plug here.
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:25:42
did u get my email? do u have .uk .au .se at the end?
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:29:00
man i just think of it as investing in a cool stock that i can actually use anytime.
i dont think of it as chasing nothing. i basically bought some useful currency, store of wealth and a stock all at the same time.
BANG!! where else can u do that?
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:36:14
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:23:56
lol. well its better than mining.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:18:43
hurry the hell up korea. you are suppose to be tech savy.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:13:21
this looks very interesting and long with great charts detailed and lovely but can u summarize it for me?
I did a very short skim over it and it looks like a article of exponential growth of sorts.
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:41:41
lol ... yeah i wasnt sure if u misunderstood or was offended easily
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:53:25
vk interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:28:06
had another read of wiki's Bitcoin and man it has sooo many references...
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:45:05
just be brave man. hold on to it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:17:09
i would sell you some of my bitcoins but im holding on really tight. its so volatile now that im not sure whats going to happen.
best bet is paying a little high so people will be willing to let go of the coin. localbitcoins.com seems to be where everyone goes if u cant get in to an exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-10 09:21:48
250... your a boss...
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:56:23
i couldnt do anything was just static
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:57:08
$600 is insane!!!!!! what are more key products with this much saving??
@_date: 2013-05-25 07:28:45
man u are lucky to get this atari...
can you guys tell me what was the cost?
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:32:46
wow!! i dont even know what the stuff is
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:22:28
true, if only more of them learn fucking english. ive lived and worked there its very very hard for them to find out about anything outside of china and outside of the language.
if there were more Chinese people actually translating then we going to see the boom.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:31:17
haha! it was erik that wrote this. thought it was rather sharp for a grandparent letter.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:33:07
LOL! wow great find.
I thought the coybow bebop electronic currency was cool but this is too.
@_date: 2013-03-19 12:23:23
On the one hand you can go with paypal which is trying to be speedy, easy and invisible. Or you can be visa, mastercard or american express which communicates a more bold solid and steady image with some connotations of speed and convenience. Or you combine the 2 which Ive attempted.
In recent times I have become pretty at odds with the orange/gold color of bitcoin it is a color that doesnt look right (it looks dirty). What bitspend ( has done with blue I think fits very well with grey type.
Here is an example of blue with bitcoin:   Using blue will also connect to paypal and a huge range of financial logos.
Here is my source file if you have any ideas based upon what I've said: 
Overall imo being very understated and quiet would be a HUGE welcome change to Bitcoin identity.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:22:28
thats awesome!!!
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:39:24
LoL!! forces me to give them my email just to check if i can get broadband. bad!
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:41:15
Interesting. thanks for sharing. i will ponder this as it applies to my life somewhat.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:05:30
LOL! the chatbox is always right!
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:35:36
u are a beautiful true nerd.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:35:45
good on u
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:00:20
true... it needs to face up...
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:15:31
I dont think its a waste of time if the face of bitcoin looks like a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:42:50
wow such bad luck dude. all i can say is dont worry about it a girl that leave so suddenly like that wasnt worth keeping around anyway.
and second if u just stay strong bitcoin will go back up again, just dont be a silly person who sells and buys in all the time you will probably loss a lot that way.
@_date: 2013-05-26 11:29:30
absolutely beautiful
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:16:41
lol!! hmm... ok look at this way. if you dont buy a car you can have some of this money laying around. its just most people but money in to shit so quickly&gt;car, house, tv, net, comp, phone, bills, beer, bla bla bla i can totally see how someone middle class can have this amount if they let go of some things.
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:34:58
hurry the hell up and break shit zuckerberg
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:14
keep up the good work
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:06:04
it was a joke that someone wrote. if bitcoin could talk that is what it would say.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:24:34
hmm, you dont understand.... if people want to give you money but you are lame and dont accept if you are not really running a business. accepting money is the soul of business and buy not accepting bitcoin more and more business are going to be lossing out on people that want to throw money at them. if they figure out a system like i mentioned in my OP that is easy to set up with no risk they are going to have another pipe line of money in to there business.
rule is never deny someone giving you money no matter what currency.
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:35:11
not going to lie he already looks pretty dodge the first i saw him.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:41:00

god damn that grocery looks delicious!!!
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:37:37
yeah cheers matt for giving bitcoin a try and dealing with any negative Nancy out there.
watching bitcoin being used like this and talked about on tv gives bitcoin a reality.
free flowing money. lets make it happen.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:39:33
cool man make sure you update us!
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:30:38
looks wrong to me?

god damn no love for backwards perth.
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:34:08
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:16:37
i remember when the first car was being sold for bitcoin that was big news.
now it just seems normal.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:16:10
good way to start is dogecoins. pretty much the same thing and cheaper.
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:38:49
agreed. but i doubt it will happen. i kind of wana see them fall to be honest. used them once and it was the worst.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:57:01

namecoin is really cool. i would love to see websites under .bit !!!
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:49:52
win win !
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:11:38
yes there would be a demand for that if your are good.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:31:00
bitcoin market = what goes down, must come up.
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:12:05
in the same vain as gaming i think twitch.tv would benefit from bitcoin.
twitch.tv is pretty much where everyone watches every type of game played live. its the sports center for video games.
right now i hate paying to watch things because frankly using the $ system is too slow.
often if i want to watch something its a spur of the moment thing and i dont plan it. by the time i deposited $ in to the system the live LIVE game is over or a i missed part of it.
LIVE content+bitcoin= good games!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:07:07
up vote, id like more information out of this guy. still how do we know you are a honest dude.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:48:54
cheers. now im hungry.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:45:48
dude, at this current time we cant do anything about it. you just have to take advantage of the situation and buy low if it goes low. hopefully a lot of smart people get the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:29:53
very quick clear and responsive site. please make it even better.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:50:40
is this site read by many?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:17:33
i got this.
@_date: 2013-07-18 07:41:32
drops so fast rises so slow these days.
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:47:00
just set it up so the site tells me.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:43:56
the other day cnn money was bashing bitcoin but now they give a balanced report. is this a different writer?
@_date: 2013-06-23 10:41:18
well that was fast
@_date: 2013-09-24 10:35:42
anyone used this? what is the process like?
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:42:03
id like it more if they bought Facebook and cleaned it up
FB is currently trash. When your using FB u are interacting in a dumpster while being surveillanced and recorded and refed your own waste over and over again.
@_date: 2013-07-28 09:24:56
wouldnt this scare people doing shady business or even legit business trying to hide there business working?
i know with a little work u can find this information out anyway but this is getting faster.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:29:48
i would love to shower that store with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-12 15:22:03
maybe u are right but to fully ignore it and not mention it? why would u do that?
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:05:28
yeah something new and thoughtful... beautiful...
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:56:03
i dont think they would be that stupid to blatantly ban bitcoin. at the end of the day it would cost way to much to enforce and would probably make it explode even more.
there are so many alt coins now its like never gona stop.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:45:49
well, its pretty easy to get that impression of bitcoin from the current identity. Just look at the backdrop in the video where they are showing the rise in price, tell me that doesnt look like phony money.
@_date: 2013-07-03 08:09:25
not a snake after all
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:25:39
so does this mean i dont have to deal with international wire transfers and can just use netbank to give u guys AUD and start trading in to BTC?
i think commbanks gona start hating it when all the AUD starts to fly away.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:38:37
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:05:58
please man im just angry... i feel lied to!
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:58:32
dont worry guys i had to wait like 6-8 hours for mine to get through. my guess is they are really backed up at gox and in the shit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:00:41
as rough as this is, i do think its pretty accurate.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:33:07
it seemed she was always trying to cut in and rush things and talk about the soon to be regulation. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:24:39
dear god man thats good news. i know a lot of people just werent that lucky in getting them on time.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:14:33
not lost  but frozen.
still bs. you put money somewhere and u should be treated like u own it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:19:37
really? try withdrawing less bitcoin a 100 is a lot. Edit: because sometimes it takes awhile even for small amounts.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:30:10
if i understand correctly, to embed bitcoin in to life charity organizations should accept it and so bitcoin users should at least give a tiny bit of donations around to help with this.
sounds logical actually...
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:22:32
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:55:37
bad luck dude! dont dwell on it and btc on!
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:55:53
i know its annoying but its going to get better. try buying any rare currency quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:36:15
i dont care about the lag... as long as the bitcoin cant be destroyed or stolen from government or hackers.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:32:59
yeah i wont all the price stuff to go...
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:19:01
Matt Miller, what a legend.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:00:37
not really. because they are so invested that would have to be reasonably educated on it. plus im sure they have a few contacts and inside knowledge on the happenings.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:06:13
it is worth something but only because the value of money transferred in to the app.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:56:24
more like i dont understand it so im scared
@_date: 2013-05-25 06:28:11
god damn pakistan is rough ay. steal your money in just one year.
@_date: 2013-06-20 11:49:06
sounds crazy. crazy good!
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:32:45
how is this a big thing? i dont see anything to read....
edit&gt; never mind i found it. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 11:49:06
yeah i also dont think u know like u just said!
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:40:25
if u start a business share it here so we all know!
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:45:33
hope you guys talk about good things!
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:59:39
u need to post a few times before u can post on the threads. go to newb area.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:06:11
doesnt matter i know it all
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:02:25
ahh he talks well
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:16:23
i think it fills a market want. crypto has been so serious this came at the right time and it has actually introduced cryptos to people that would otherwise wouldnt have cared.
perfect timing. i predict the 'joke' to stick around for a very long time.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:27:38
good advice, actually went and did a whole bunch of password changes because i just didnt trust btc-e.
btc-e is still useful for litecoin and checking price, so dont discount the site.
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:49:28
win or loss the site is very very interesting and i hope to god its kept pure and stays alive.
there is no way to prove that dooglus is manipulating anything so dont go on a witch hunt.
least not yet!
edit:  &lt;(((ursula&gt;
@_date: 2013-06-11 07:49:25
dude i just lost 1 mBTC... ;}

thats what i do!
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:57:46
GOD!! dont jinx it u fool!
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:26:07
read about this before and i still dont understand it. maybe have could play around with it, i would know.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:47:35
finally some perth action. its happening.
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:37:27
sounds complicated but i suppose business people love this
@_date: 2013-09-30 20:06:02
well dont play lol but used to play dota. still would like to see some decent game bet sites that dont look shit
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:47:04
hmm i feel a rally going....... 
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:00:09
i would too, this would be simply amazing.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:04:29
crux i agree u have good taste
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:59:45
seriously this is wrong!
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:54:45
search the dark web and u can find even more fun stuff
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:02:39
real losses, real dice, just-dice
@_date: 2013-07-05 11:31:38
“I expect the price to hit four-digit numbers by the end of 2013 or in 2014, with further exponential growth continuing in coming years. This is great time for large players with long time investment horizons to enter the market.”
when i read that it is a bit like a tease. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 08:01:32
interesting music. there is a problem downloading the zip file. just not enough download speed and it disconnected. 
had to stream it.
interesting graphics also. very old style tech look.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:12:44
im in the same boat made me miss out big time
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:01:48
num num num! i love buying those bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:39:34
yeah possibly. i can see both paths here. i want the technology to work because the world is getting more global and im sick to death of being charged more money to use my own money overseas.
edit: also id be happy to donate more often if i could donate small amounts but with the current system its so clunky and slow.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:52:12
good luck to the person that bought it!
@_date: 2013-07-27 11:34:58
dude he is fucking old. i honestly think he doesnt care cause this technology isnt going to benefit him in his life time.
probably a big factor in what is holding back bitcoin are the people with power/money and influence holding back. it just happens to be all the oldies.
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:35:34
wow the man needs a drink!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:33:27
yeah sounds good. to bad that exchange didnt send me a verification email.
@_date: 2013-10-25 05:55:48
keep seeing small bits of news about Africa but im just waiting for some real pictures, people and stories.
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:23:36
dude when u finally get in the low prices are going to be gone! but u can still buy right? u just cant withdraw?
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:38:16
ok cheers. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:44:28
hard to read but the thing i got was Ireland might get rapped dont know how true or when it could happen but if it does more use for bitcoin, no?
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:19:14
Sounds good... but im going to make my noob predication and say that next 2 weeks we wont see much rise or fall.
remember who called it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:51:38
legend right here
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:58:31
you will need roughly 1000 dollars to day trade i think. anything less and the fees are going to start hurting you too much.
before i warn you about the obvious floor of daytrading bitcoin im just going to say that im from australia and im with gox. to wire cash to gox you will need to pay roughly 30 dollars; your bank will charge you 25 or so and when it gets to japan some more money gets lost there. more or less...
mtgox has a trading fee of 0.06% roughly and so if u trade 1000aud in to coin u will loss 6 dollars. not so bad really but if u day trade a lot its going to build up really really badly. the trading fee will go down the more you trade a lot, but not by much, like 0.05 on going 0.045.
what i have not confirmed is withdrawing your AUD back to your aus bank, you will probably be hit with another fee of 20-30. and gox will only let you take 1000 out. you can sign up for 10000 but they really want to see all your details and a real letter post of the copies of your id. freaking pain in the ass.
taking bitcoin out of mtgox is easier and u can do larger amounts. you can always withdraw bitcoin if u make a profit put it in your wallet and trade it in Australia for aud, that will take awhile i guess but you wont hit the fees or withdraw limits on gox or your banks.
before you day trade id warn you that its not really easy to day trade bitcoin, im finding more and more that its probably better to hold and its probably better to just buy in dips. all the rules of daytrading and stocks in no way applies to bitcoin. you will pretty much be gambling and guessing.
as time goes on owning bitcoin is more and more valuable so you dont want to loss them.
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:04:52
 they actually did a few studies and seems to be a lot of evidence. I have even read this material in a book unrelated to this clip.
 i think we are more easily influenced then we actually realize.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:47:02
looks so small it is not going fullscreen for me
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:39:44
can some one please tell me how the hell am i suppose to know what my player number.... doesnt make any sense
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:38:41
-_- give me a break dude
@_date: 2013-06-19 11:38:25
just looks tacky but ive always thought the gambling scene is tacky looking.
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:53:10
when i first read the title i thought it was already done and was excited.
was a bit disappointed reading all the comments talking about tall the problems of why it isnt done.
this to me is a really cool idea and there should be a way to attach bitcoin to the tor network.
like bitcoin you should be able to work anonymously if u put the effort in it. most people know now that bitcoin isnt anonymous unless u put in work to be. tor is also not 100% anonymous, you still need to take extra measures to be so.
if say, tor and bitcoin mining or something alike was somehow introduced than i suspect most people donating there computer power wouldn't really care too much about being anonymous.
@_date: 2013-06-16 08:17:16
seems pretty high considering all that negative stuff you just mentioned is going on.
id say i attribute the low cost to a bit of all of the above.
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:06:51
someone needs to invent a more cost efficient paper/ink and for receipts.
@_date: 2013-06-20 05:37:37
nice model on the site.
its also nice to see the bitcoin logo below.
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:05:56
i couldnt agree more. getting any topic looked at on bitcointalk forums is surprisingly hard. the older thread users dominate all conversation and new idea/questions are very quickly answered or stomped out.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:51:57
o boy keep the news rolling!
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:31:22
probably wont get any sleep now.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:51:52
another bites the dust!
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:18:16
pretty good indeed!
@_date: 2013-07-17 13:50:59
its missing some of the cheapest airlines
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:17:55
what country?
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:12:51
good injection of reality. thank you for sharing. i do hope something like this comes in the near future.
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:17:40
lol that screenshot almost likes identical to my screen
@_date: 2013-04-21 13:33:10
man this guy is good!
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:17:08
wtf is that logo they are trying to look more futuristic now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:34:17
lol so funny. all white people. information elite.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:12:38
he doesnt understand how the internet works. you have to word things correctly or at least do a bit more research. def brought this on himself. but yeah anyone who is being super rude is a bit over board.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:35:12
well thats a good way of looking at it. but another way of looking at is that lots of fearful noobs are selling there bitcoins to the more experienced bitcoin users.
im certainly catching a few on the dips.
its a bit hard to know for sure if large sell offs are going to new bitcoin users or the more experienced ones.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:01:59
cool cool.!
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:49:25
this was damn good.
lots of examples presented well.
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:26:36
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:44:21
this kind of looks wrong... can someone look more in to it and is this a good thing?
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:04:11
where are the results!?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:08:29
yeah, dont even have to use this i know its good
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:49:06
Thanks for sharing and being honest. This information helps other people learn security.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:52:14
this information is pretty good. nice rand down with some stats.
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:13:20
i dont get the site background pics its all too epic and vague.
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:00:40
wow really puts in to perspective, doesnt it.
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:03:41
although this is becoming true for nation bank transfers the fact is the world is getting global.
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:22:48
i got the same response. maybe they are serious maybe they are not.
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:14:30
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:56:24
Rothschild what SOB. Probably rigged the markets thats why.
@_date: 2013-09-11 14:58:38
is this like Expensify
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:24:53
its not impossible. if the market keeps acting like it has the last 4-5 years then this is actually a pretty obvious prediction.
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:31:20
what a story!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:18:03
cool design.
anybody heard any comments from this article? 
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:12:19
good good!
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:46:36
haha yeah right they would do this. i think all the big dogs now wana stay clean.
just need a new dog to do the more shady deals, its a market opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:04:32
nice! looks yum
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:19:15
key word. SOME! cashing everything imo is very short sighted.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:33:22
easy the blockchain. do a little research.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:56:12
let him...
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:20:10
its a good questions. i think ultimatly it will always be better if the wealth is spread. but because this is new its super hard for anyone to get in to it so only people that a risky and people that have money jump in first.
when the water is safe the rest will jump in and then the wealth will spread a bit more.
not sure how to spread the wealth more. maybe just give donations and tips more often i think. more and more of the bitcoin big dogs should do this.
also an intelligent post released today was on the price going on. if the price goes up instead of cashing out just buy a few things with bitcoin while the bitcoin is high. if it falls buy some more bitcoin but least u didnt cash out u just used the advantage of high bitcoin cost.
in many ways if your are american you can take advantage of bitcoin more,
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:18:03
still has to list everything.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:32:02
who keeps buying at a 100. why isnt there a wall ????
@_date: 2013-06-23 13:47:31
omfg that is gold...
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:53:00
wow poor guy! its not to late. just go back in to bitcoin slowly and naturally and use it simply because its a good thing.
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:37:50
Sorry for replying so late. But I agree, it does seem a bit too corporate and inpersonal and infact complicated. But overall I would prefer this logo over the current so I still like it on some level.
I think using black personally is very difficult because it does communicate a little bit of hostility.
The only bank I know that uses black successfully is commonwealth bank of australia and even now they are using grays more often then blacks.
I think bitcoin logo should look similer to paypal. no bullshit just some basic simple communication. the techology is already complicated and we dont need the logo to be.
Im still in huge disbelief over the love of the current and established and when i saw the new 3D coin on the front of bitcoin redit, i just found it pretty laughable on so many levels.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:35:22
thanks, you made me sound like a kid but i needed that.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:28:41
anyone who sells is going to be met by my buying
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:49:40
anything below 90 is really cheap, to bad i dont trust btc-e with large sums. small sums maybe
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:25:06
well see. well see.
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:14:35
im still waiting on mine and its been 3 days... and now its the weekends. so should be done by monday if not monday then there is problems.
going to try and take out more on monday and see how long it takes from the beginning of the week.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:47:15
cant wait for the next show...
@_date: 2013-09-08 08:57:35
I think for where we are in bitcoin history this is relevant. Not many people know what BTC so I think the logo and maybe even the bar code is relevant (for the time being). Besides people use the cell phone for nearly everything now.
The Bitcoin font is pretty cheesy for sure! LOL!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:18:24
dude use a friend that has an address or get a local library, post office or some official building to help u with the address they can be the proxy if u know what i mean?
this does sound like a shitty problem. i myself found it bothersom to come up with all the identity stuff.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:51:57
first ive seen this. ill look out for the nerd next time.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:50:19
get this stuff going!!!
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:47:49
just a quick look at the site it looks a little weird?
@_date: 2013-09-08 09:39:21
dont worry ill change it eventually...
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:39:38
really wow, she sounds good man...
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:19:30
dude just be safe...
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:28:07
lol yep!
@_date: 2013-10-15 18:31:01
alexis dont do insider trading. soon as you dad asks about bitcoin tell us!
@_date: 2013-09-26 19:51:39
drop dropbox. hasnt done anything for anyone
@_date: 2013-06-11 11:24:23
ok when i think back to the first time i wanted to understand bitcoin i went to the wiki page back a year ago and gave up trying to understand it because it was so technical.
it took 6-8 months later to try giving bitcoin another chance and it was only when the price started rising did i put more time in to it.
bottom line, skip the technical crap and get to the good bits.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:06:12
id love this. it give incentive for people to create more if bitcoin contributions become common place.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:08:27
he is good!!! tips coming up!!!
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:19:43
for a tech business its pretty funny how behind they are. wired is becoming a bit of a lagger and incosistent resource for technology.

better down vote this guy because giving such advice when actually nobody knows what is going on.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:44:17
man i just look at the bitcoin logo and those crappy clipart coin and it looks so phony...
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:43:36
this could be huge...
edit: waiting 2 days for a bank transfer (hope dont miss the boat on this one)
edit2: its only for the anti-DDOS service.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:32:49
yep yep truth be told here. just the idea if mining was so interesting when i first read up on bitcoin. so i imagen a lot of nerds droll over this crap.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:30:13
what about someone not pretty girls? bitcoin should not discriminate.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:13:28
LOL that meme is real funny for me.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:38:35
with a graphics card?
@_date: 2013-06-20 10:30:50
well might use it if its actually cheaper and legit
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:18:51
link? this sounds like bs...
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:20:40
wow its old and slipped through the cracks. fucking good!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:58:20
it does look star trekkie. i like it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:50:57
agreed i gave up looking for bitcoin and just take the posters word for it.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:34:54
Im in this same weird situation... On the one hand I'm glad I'm making a profit from my current BTC, but on the other it feels more and more risky to buy bitcoin because of how expensive they are now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:22:29
depends where u r in the world. 
 if u are in australia
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:13:55
he looked almost close to being convinced of the btc techology.
then again its pretty easy to be convinced when u have people sending u money.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:48:11
yeah streamlined. good timing too.
the guy sounds swedish or something?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:33:01
this the truth. youth has the advantage of time and being able to make mistakes. this is a good risk and a great technology to have a crack at.
as long as the son keeps most of his bitcoin overtime, it will teach him a few things.
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:55:41
dont worry about it so much. all time highs dont come often so let people enjoy it a little bit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:01:58
seriously... again.. another ddos attack.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:30:43
lol it be smarter just to buy bitcoin with that money. id say a lot  of new people are getting in on it and not really understanding it.
edit: mining seems to be the first thing you think of doing before buying some.
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:40:02
If worse comes to worse and we really do accept the double vertical lines. The lines should not intersect the B, i agree.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:09:06
its going up pretty fast but i like to think its because it went down so fast. just a lot of people buying back. if it keeps going at the speed i dont know what to do, but if slows down abit id say its organic.
SOO hard to read this bitcoin crap.
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:29:09
I'm trying to get involved in the current discussion on the Bitcoin identity but the bitcointalk.org restricts new users and all the threads are locking me out.
Its a bit hard to get any alternative discussion going.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:44:09
hmm bring on the ads... if it gets to much and once bitcoin has a foothold start cutting them out again.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:27:44
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:14:13
still a majority of people on the site are negative nancies when it comes to bitcoin.
still good to see those id be curious of the stats for who uses btc on the site.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:45:40
totally agree....
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:53:41
sounds tasty!!!!!!!
can u get home dilvery of mc donolds
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:42:59
i always thought china would take years to warm up the the idea. good for them good for current bitcoiners that they are wising up.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:10:04
your loss
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:14:23
id like that.
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:45:18
so far it looks steady
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:37:31
for me its linked. but from the 2 comments i see already it seems a lot of people dont see it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 07:29:11
yeah! go australia!
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:56:44
lol. if that was true man what a douche. isnt it enough that he owns everyone's personal information.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:34:54
hmm i always thought a group. but the Mahn makes  good point.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:21:01
yeah well nice change from the upstuck know it alls
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:24:45
brilliant thanks
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:02:24
people dont panic as much when the price goes up. when the price does sudden drops fear really gets real.
common tactic is be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. in other words buy when people panic (at the lows). sell when people are driving the price up to quick. (only sell some)
@_date: 2013-11-06 09:10:20
ill try and find it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:42:06
exactly this is what many people were talking about.
if this works then many others business will follow.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:28:41
i dont even understand dude????
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:57:44
all i need to know is does this benefit bitcoin in the long run and how can i measure this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:43:39
funny because i seem to be ok. mind you i dont have much invested on the site.
it did take a long time to get the email verification working
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:10:42
no worries. we can take that.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:37:11
man  up you women! this is bitcoin. be bloody thankful its not lower than 50!
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:44:02
i lived in china for 8 months yo.
i ment be safe with handling bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:53:56
Buying bitcoins to replace the bitcoins spent. i really wonder how many people are doing this now.
it would be a massive deal if this was a common thing. everyone doing this means bitcoin price wont fall as much. it would also mean whole 1btc will become very rare.
problem i have is the speed of sending fiat to trade it to bitcoins. guess the best way to get around it is just to send fiat long before u wana buy and sit on it until u need it. Is this what u do?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:31:05
yeah that. i know he is the founder of lsd but im not sure of 10,000 is really worth it.
how about the guys that found penacilen, MDMA, meth. this is the first ive seen such a high price placed on a signature of a chemist.
plus it said it would go up in price. if anything 10,000 is as high as it will go? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:21:24
exactly what ive been thinking.
there were people lining up to buy btc. people that understand btc will see this as a good time to buy.
its been all over the news, more people are aware of it the fear just needs to slowly fade.
btc is still too useful to throw away.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:33:06
why hasnt this come out earlier.
We had a media report on isreal but not on finland.
Finland is much more interesting with there technology, software, politics and location
@_date: 2013-09-26 16:38:36
looks good i wonder if it is good
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:49:59
wow low 6 figures, man you are strong. trust me thats a good thing u going to get more anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:31:52
I looked for a little while and i dont get how to assign a webpage to a QR code.
I generated a QR on 
but when do this i dont have the option of assinging a site, it seems to link to a HK style website for each new QR i generate.
someone explain to me, im 5 years old
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:34:52
i want updates on this in detail
@_date: 2013-07-27 11:31:31
post it. why not?
I feel they didnt want to endorse bitcoin too much. i watched the piece and it seems neutral.
@_date: 2013-04-27 12:41:31
man oh man gl trading....
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:02:29
how much bitcoin did u make in tips for this?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:07:52
wonder if there is any women that actively learn, research and invest in bitcoin or is it 99.9% males?
strip for bitcoin does not count.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:18:08
lol good for you piggy
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:57:18
god u sound dumb
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:20:33
dont just tell us to adobt btc. we already have. go tell others how easy and useful btc is.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:25:27
god!!! the more people talk about the price and the more people pull out charts like this the more its actually really going to happen.
its called a self fulfilling prophecy, now mix that with some herd mentality and a touch of sink loss fallacy the price is def going to go up and down for a long long time but the steady rate of climb is for sure.
by me saying this a lot more people are going to read and understand what i said and get self educated resulting in a new breed of newbie day traders; enforcing this self fulfilling prophecy.
but yes it will reach new high highs and new low highs thus averaging a steady climb.
edit: you will loss a lot of money if you are not careful. only put in and accept it as a loss before u actually loss it.
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:22:27
cool video but its so funny they missed a thing like bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:21:29
yep this is true. id say the floor would be pretty small but its still a floor.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:43:36
that will do pig, that will do.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:41:57
read the comments, yahoo users are pretty dumb/... 
@_date: 2013-03-16 05:59:53
this is really really good!
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:57:36
I dont know dude, just ive never seen you before and you were just really convincing and ones got to be a bit wary of that.
dont worry take it as a compliment in disguise.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:52:19
are you a fool... just look at it. its growing. just because its small doesn't mean it isnt a economy. what are you going to say small local tribes out in the desert or wherever dont have there own small economy.
also players that use mmo to trade that is a economy too. open your mind people live in different ways.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:37:42
hope bloody builds that exchange quickly!!
