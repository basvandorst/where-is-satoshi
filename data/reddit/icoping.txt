If you want monetary freedom, I suggest you diversify into altcoins. Bitcoin's fees are only going to keep going up. Lightning network is 2+ years from being deployed and by then, another coin will have taken the  spot. Do you want to take a guess as to which one it will be?

Yes, everyone pointing out the obvious is a shill. Do you like having your head buried in the sand?

No I definitely read the whitepaper. It says a peer to peer electronic cash payments system. As far as I know, it doesn't cost $25+ to hand someone cash and it doesn't take 2 days or fail completely if your fee is too low. How are you going to act high and mighty when you are the one telling people to go use paypal? Yeesh

They are, but they are too delusional to see it. Everything is an attack. Everything is spam. Everything is Roger or Jihan or Coinbase etc etc etc. They have no ability to open their eyes and make the realization that it is their own ignorance that is the problem, that and the intentional FUD designed to smear anything or anyone that supports a bigger block size.

At this point Bitcoin Cash is much more likely to hit 50K than Bitcoin Core. Why? Because Cash is actually useful as a currency. Legacy Bitcoin is now a HODL-only "store of value" coin which is only useful for day traders and HODL'ers to make money off of. It's not the technology that will change the world like we had all hoped years ago. It will almost certainly lose it's  spot if not in 2018, then the year after. That's the cold, hard truth that you people don't want to accept. You did this to yourselves by the way, because you refused to listen to reason and you gave in to divisive rhetoric - and you believe the propaganda about the blocksize. Bitcoin will never scale, EVER if it does not increase from 1mb to higher levels. Lightning Network is perpetually "18 months" from being released and is basically vaporware at this point. Congratulations on your Banker-controlled High-Fee coin. Everyone who wants to see Crypto actually CHANGE THE WORLD and not just get Rich, have already moved on to other coins and projects which are far, FAR more innovative than anything Blockstream could possibly dream of.

Bitcoin no longer transfers any value at all quickly or cheaply. Bitcoin transfers are now more expensive than a bank wire and sometimes are also slower. It's sad and this is not what it was meant to be. Stop apologizing for Blockstream, they stole the Bitcoin name, divided the community and turned Bitcoin into a slow, expensive settlement network to benefit themselves. Why make excuses for them? edit: The fact that you recommend using credit cards or paypal speaks volumes. Bitcoin was meant to replace them. Do you work for a bank?

When you know that the mempool shouldn't be getting full in the first place because they should have just increased the effing blocksize already. LN itself doesn't scale to mass use without a blocksize increase either, as on-chain transactions are required to open, close and top off channels.

What are you smoking? Lightning Network is 2-3 years off from being deployed, at best. The title of this thread is false. By then everyone will have already moved on from Bitcoin to something that scales on-chain and doesn't intentionally restrict growth or intentionally introduce $20+ fees to their network.

Your problem is that you are assuming that your position is the correct one and not the other person's. Have you considered that maybe BCH is not defrauding anyone but is actually following the original whitepaper instead of deviating. You become like a radical, fanatical core believer but what backs up your belief and why must you rabidly label someone an "enemy" based on what is nothing more than propaganda?

Ver is a major investor in shapeshift. How does it feel to be a major Core tard? You people act like you have rabies, everytime something does something minorly offensive to Core you freak out and have a fit. What's with the idol worship?

I don't know. Maybe because Adam Back is a disgusting liar?
Bet $5 I will be banned for this post.  The censorship here is laughable
