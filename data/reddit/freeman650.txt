/s will suffice.

Completely misrepresented Bitcoins.  Couldn't even figure out how to buy any. .  Craigslist?  Really?  Completely untraceable?  You should know better Adam.  I did enjoy Colbert's antics on the subject, however.

Thanks, it appears I was just clicking on wrong shit.

The reference number is given after payment, correct?

Yes, you are the only one.  The SilkRoad is no secret.

This works similar to Bitstamp, correct?  Wherein you get the money on their site first and then purchase bitcoins rather than directly from ZipZap, or bitinstant?  It would cost less than $100 in all fees to purchase BTC on bitfloor, if the calculations I've done are correct.

sellers gonna sell

Have some enthusiasm!
@_date: 2013-03-09 06:49:18
sell it on bitstamp, or hold onto it.  You never know if it'll be worth $1,000,000 eventually ;)

Sorry I haven't been taking notes, but they interviewed Coinbase and BitPay and the the reddit bitcoin tipping service was mentioned!

I am guessing some type of escrow system.

Any idea when we will be able to safely make deposits again?  
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:03:53
I'll drink to that!

how do I make a deposit on bitme?  When I click the "make a deposit" button it just sends me to the top of the page . .

I don't usually do this but your post instantly made me think of [this](

Holy butthole, that's a nice chunk of BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:00:31
I've never had to show ID using moneygram and use cash to keep it completely anonymous.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:04:48
No, you're thinking of BMR (Black Market Reloaded).  SilkRoad has rules

I keep getting "Invalid Exchange" when trying to buy &lt;500$ of BTC through blockchain.info, any ideas?
