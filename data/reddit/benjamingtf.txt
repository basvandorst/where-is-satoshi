Wouldn't this be just as feasible with gold? I don't think Bitcoins are uniquely useful as a method of inheritance tax evasion.

The problem is with "**Lol** whore"

It can if they find your wallet file.
Similarly, gold cant be taken if its well hidden.

It seems like there is no quick way to cash out or buy in 'completely', meaning that going from dollars in your bank account (or cash, CC, etc) to raw bitcoins in your wallet.dat file, or the other way around, always takes at least a couple days.

This is the first I have heard about 'CoinedBits'. They are just novelty coins, no value.
I looked into them because I was thinking that it would be cool if independent organizations created a physical bitcoin that you could redeem at any time for a bitcoin value. Basically a 'silver certificate' or liberty dollar, but backed by digital bitcoins instead of physical metal. This would allow bitcoin spending in situations where there is no internet access or electricity.

Do you want to advertise the Bitcoin subreddit or Bitcoins themselves? I'd personally rather promote Bitcoins than a subreddit.

Thanks! That is pretty cool.

I am sort of new to bitcoin, but why to do people do this? If you have a lot of BTC, put it in a 'savings' wallet. Encrypt that shit with a STRONG password (at least 10 characters with symbols, numbers upper and lower case), that you have memorized. Then back that up like crazy, email it to yourself in case your house burns down etc. Keep control to yourself. Isn't that the point?

So is this 'wolf' person saying that more people using bitcoin is a bad thing??

probablly mean to create an encrypted container file that contains the wallet (with something like truecrypt), and name that file with a .jpeg extension (this works just fine in truecrypt) and then email that fake .jpeg file.

I would assume that most people who want to donate dont already use bitcoins, and will thus have to purchase some, driving prices up. So the inflation of them selling their donated coins should be somewhat balanced out by people buying them to donate.
Also, as markio said, it gives bitcoins more publicity. I would argue that is even more valuble, and will overall *increase* the value of bitcoins.

I mean, as far as pure probability, this type of thing is probably relatively unlikely to happen to someone. And by accepting paypal donations, you will probably end up getting a lot more. Also, the chance of loosing money, I am not sure, did they get charged $10 total, or $10 per reversed transaction?? If it was just a flat $10 for all of them, then I would say the calculated risk was the right decision. 
I am not trying to defend PayPal at all, that was fucked up of them to do. I am just saying that as far as *expected value* goes (as in the [math term]( its probably still a good idea to accept PP donations. Still good to accept multiple methods of payments though.

Im talking out of my ass here but I'm guessing that G and Amazon choose not to be in other countries more than the countries restricting the companies.

This looks like just the type of program I have been looking for. However, how is it open source with a GPL, but the source code is not available? (Also boo for no linux version)
