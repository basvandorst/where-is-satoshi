Omg, the medication alone for my oldest dog is about $200 a month. She's about 14 1/2 now, and doing great though! 
And then there's the jack russel who just cost me about $500 in surgery bills to remove three of the twelveish fatty tumors she's growing. Thankfully, they're benign, but those three had just gotten too big.

Or random people from claiming to be good breeders.

Bad rep for contributing to asshole people abandoning dogs when they get bored or overwhelmed. That's also been my experience with the breeder I do know in the city I live in. They're just fucking dumb as shit people who keep breeding pits and this other kind of dog, like a yorkie or something. Like, they had a small yard, too many dogs, couldn't get rid of them soon enough, ended up euthanizing some of the puppies and couldn't afford to treat simple illnesses like a respiratory infection. They're disgusting humans and they keep doing the. same. damn. thing. Over and over, because people keep giving them money. 
So that's why I personally hate them, but there was one breeder out in the country who treated their dogs really well that I met. But then they gave one of the dogs to a woman who immediately euthanized the pup because he was too much to care for (he had a bum back), so they inadvertently contributed to that shitty situation too (which I don't fuuullllllly fault them for). 
Adoption is better than contributing to those situations imo, even though you still run the risk of people treating the animals poorly, at least you're not further adding/paying to raise (or breed) the likelihood of something terrible happening, like inhumane treatment. And you're giving a loving creature a new home when it would otherwise DIE.

Tl;Dr, still want a cigarette

I'm not arguing, just pointing a fact out lol

Thanks! It's a pain in the ass.

It isn't a stupid example. They're just advocating for adoption of abandoned animals over purchasing from breeders. And people are getting super defensive about it because it's reddit. Lots of abandoned animals are really sweet and trainable, too. I personally have four rescue dogs, one of which is less than a year old and knows about 20-30 words and at least 10-20 tricks. She is absolutely the most well-behaved dog I've ever had.

Lol, yeah that is shitty. Dogs can be such dogs.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:18:06
I think you're responding to the wrong person lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:08
Awuh, I'm sorry to hear that! She must've been super smart with that kind of mix. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:21:28
Lol, that's funny though. Have an upvote.

I always end up finding my pets randomly. The concept of paying for them is pretty far removed from my reality, but you're right. We don't know how op got the puppy, and they have it now so it doesn't matter. The best thing people who care could do is encourage adoption over breeding in general. All dogs are good dogs though &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:17:08
They're advocating for adoption over breeding. A lot of animals that have been abandoned are very sweet and trainable.

Puppy mill people consider themselves breeders and use the label too. 
But barring puppy Mills from the example, we still have a major issues with fucking idiots over breeding dogs, euthanizing them and not treating infections when they get overwhelmed. There are some decent ones out in the country, but we still end up having breed specific rescues to help counter the amount abandoned pure breeds once people realize that a dog is kinda like having a smart/dumb/hairy kid in the house all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:17:57
I've been told it's worth the suffering in the long run. Gotta keep going strong!
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:24:28
Lots of pups in shelters are problem free. I've always gone rescue and have never had a problem. My family also volunteered with a rescue agency when I was younger, so we'd have TONS of pups at our house. It was amazing. All perfect little snuggle buddies. I miss those babes. ;-;
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:28:36
But so sweet though. I like to think they help keep the heating bill down in the winter through cuddles. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:18:41
Noooo, I'm trying to quit, lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:16:51
I can just imagine the look in her eyes with that kind of personality. My childhood best friend is 14 1/2ish now, and while she's doing pretty well, it's getting more and more difficult for her to move around. I've had her since I was 9 years old, so I know it'll be the hardest dog death I'll ever face. :[
I feel for you &lt;3

Puppy mill people use the label breeders. And there are some seriously shitty breeders who don't qualify for the label puppy mill. One of the breeders in the city I live in euthanizes puppies when they get overwhelmed and can't afford to treat illnesses. People keep giving them money though so they keep doing it. Because they're "reputable breeders" for pits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:42:23
I get that too. Like, I LOVE huskies and would love to have one, but I personally still wouldn't contribute to breeding. I also really want a cigarette right now, but I know it's bad for me and the environment, so I'm not going to have one. Even though I really want one. really bad. goddammit 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:06
Oh yeah, without a doubt. We have a pug rescue that I know of in my city. But it also goes to show you that pure breeds are being abandoned by their owners too, who likely first bought them from a 'reputable' breeder. I have two border collie mixes myself! Ones an Australian/German Shepherd collie - beautiful coat. Collies are the best damn dog breed there is imo.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:51:37
Sometimes the issue lies with the owners if the problems continue, depending on the severity of it obviously. Like just barking isn't that bad, but biting at people is. One of my rescues (the youngest) did chase someone down the street, but I corrected the behavior and now she's the most obedient dog I've ever had. That being said, I think it's pretty natural for dogs to misbehave like that occasionally so I personally didn't see it as a problem, but an opportunity for training. 
Sucks that you hate the dogs though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:12:35
You're definitely right. I'm hoping they didn't buy from a breeder too. :[
still a super cute puppy tho
