No, unfortunately Mt.Gox doesn't support stop loss orders yet.

I think the only really bad news is that we started February 2013 at 20$ and we ended it at 34$ (Not to mention Feb is the shortest month of the year) The rise has been quite something. Personally i almost find it too good to be true, and one lesson i learned quite early on in life: If something seems to good to be true, it usually is. 
I got in at 9 Euros (~12 USD) so it can drop a long way before i lose my initial investment, but people buying at current rate don't have that luxury. There is no way of knowing if we are at the end of a rise, in the middle or merely at the beginning. Its a gamble to some extend, but i'm in it for the long run.

Yes, you can sell them on Mt. Gox for more, but good luck getting the money out! 
With the recent Mt.Gox bank troubles, the 43$ per bitcoin is your risk premium i'm guessing.

Yes, if it is a bot that placed it and it does not take it down, it means at least $399,000 worth of bitcoins need to be bought before the price can rise above $21

Yes you can, but then you can not spend them. This "whole other installation" is about being able to spend them too, by having the offline pc sign your transactions and sending them with the online watch-only client.

The "wall" in this example is an ask order (to exchange BTC for USD) at 21$ for a grand total of 19K BTC. I  believe it is called a wall because you will need 19K BTC of bid orders at 21$ to raise the price beyond 21$.
So you can see it acts as a "wall" preventing the price rising above 21$ for a while.

You do indeed have a cold-storage wallet that cannot spend bitcoins on its own but only recieve them. 
I'm pretty sure the private key and chain you printed out can be used to "recover" your wallet with other clients too, but at the moment i'm hard pressed to mention one that can do it, but there might be others here that are more experienced with other wallets.
