Ya but they didn't have the internet back then

As someone new to bitcoin with a limited understanding of the technical aspects of the cryptocurrency I cannot imagine a scenario where spoofing blocksize would give anyone anywhere an advantage. Can you go into more detail on a scenario like you've described? I would like to be better informed on this subject since it seems to have cropped up here frequently over the past week or so. Thank you.

Oh I guess that is my mistake then. I was under the impression that to utilize the full features of segwit a hard fork would be required as there is a (variable?) blocksize increase in segwit as well. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:33:40
This just seems like the free market at work. If you're one of the 49% who can't accommodate the increase then you need to adapt or die. I don't see the issue with that. It only increases centralization if no other 'competitors' can also create larger blocks.
The second item you mentioned could already be a problem, no? The largest pool(s) could theoretically refuse to acknowledge blocks other people create, couldn't they?
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:06:27
There is already a massive incentive to have the largest mining pool and it doesn't stop competition.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:28:51
I guess I don't understand why there can be smaller pools of miners but not one big pool of EVERY miner. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:31:47
Is there any reason why there are pools at all? As someone who is mostly an outsider to bitcoin it would seem more beneficial to the network to pay miners as if everyone was working in one big "pool". That way there wouldn't have to be competing pools at all, everyone would get paid based on their total hash contribution.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:14:17
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:03:03
I understand what a pool is and how it functions. What I don't understand is why they exist rather than having it function as one giant pool where people are rewarded based solely on their hashrate rather than based on the hashrate and which pool they're a part of/how big the pool is/whether or not that pool ultimately mines the reward.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:49:25
If there isn't a 'threshold' level of hash power that needs to be devoted to one or the other, how do they decide when to switch?
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:09:36
You're confusing the gambler's fallacy with investing.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:37:16
I thought miner support was the only thing holding back either upgrade? My understanding was that once they reach consensus support among miners it would switch. Can you explain that a little further?
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:24:27
Right, but why isn't there just one pool that everyone is contributing to by default?
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:00:49
The same way the pools currently do the exact thing you're asking?
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:27:03
So how do they decide when to switch then?
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:07:56
So everyone not in a pool splits the block reward based on individual contributions to the hash rate?
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:08:51
You could then flip around your original premise on segwit: doesn't matter how many miners support segwit if the rest of the ecosystem doesn't.
My point being that a hard fork will be necessary in either case so making a case against a hard fork seems silly.

Thank you for your contribution
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:07:00
I still don't see the problem with that. If you cannot compete with the better hardware then of course you're not going to do as well as the competition. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:25:57
Ah. Thank you for the info in any case.
