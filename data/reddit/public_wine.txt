EFT as in Electronic Funds Transfer, not ETFs, but thanks for the insight re: transaction fees.

A technical question from a non-technical person: 
What is the mechanism by which funds are transferred from an online bank account into a BTC wallet? Is it basically an EFT? And, further, is there a cost associated with the transfer of funds from a bank account and into the marketplace where BTC is exchanged for hard currency?
Generally, I am curious about the transactions costs of shifting an amount of currency X sitting in a bank account into BTC and vice versa.

BitCoin needs to lose the hyper-volatility if it ever wants anyone who isn't already a convert to take it seriously as a useful store of value.

As far as I can tell, there really isn't any other reason to hold BTC. Either you need a digital currency for online/discreet transactions or you are investing in an asset with the intention of generating a return - for my money, I'd just as soon use other, more reliable options to accomplish either goal and I certainly wouldn't try to use one vehicle to accomplish both simultaneously.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.

Primarily - it's not a good method of payment because BTC is not widely believed to be a reliable store of value (the primary requirement for adoption of any currency)
Secondarily - aggregate transaction, time, and exchange costs are comparable to the costs of existing methods, providing no real incentive to shift
