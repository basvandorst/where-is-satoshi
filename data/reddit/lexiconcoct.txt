I don't think it is double taxation. We would only get taxed on the capital gains, not the cost basis.  It would be like buying gold, and then using it to pay for something.  If the price of gold went up in the interim, then we are taxed on the gains only.
Now, the details of the efficient accounting of it all is an entirely different matter.

Not a bad article.  I just sent a link to a friend who was inquiring about bitcoins, and what they were.

I am also quite new to this space (only 6 weeks), so I am still learning... however, if I understand it correctly, the BTCs are not stored on any computers.  Your wallet on your computer only stores the public addresses and the private keys.  The actual BTCs are recorded in the blockchain as associated with those addresses.  You need the private keys to access the BTC.
So the real focus of the security is to not lose access to the private keys.
Please correct me if I have any of it wrong. Thanks.

Great answers. Thanks.

I invested 0.5% of my wealth in BTC, and am pleased that it is now represents 3.3%.  From here on, it will be dollar cost averaging, unless there is a big crash, and then I'll shift other assets.

dollar cost averaging makes any second-guessing go away

The reason I want to do the K1/K2 approach is that I want to be able to reconstruct a set of encrypted private keys entirely from a single starting passphrase.  I have a (large) set of insanely long initial passphrases, which can each generate a repeatable series of encrypted private keys through this process.
And if it is reasonable to use the same brainwallet initial passphrase for each of the subsequent BIP38 private keys, then I only need one passphrase to generate and unlock every private key in a series.
In my last sentence, by "reasonable" I mean from an algorythmic sense, are there any issues that erode the security of the private keys.  I don't think there is, but I do not understand the code and how it works.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:32:43
Thanks.  I was playing around with creating encrypted brainwallets, and yes, the new private keys all begin with 6P.  I guess I'm going to have to experiment with a fractional bitcoin to figure out how to control the transactions.

oh yes, one additional question... does anyone know how safe, open source, trusted and vetted bit2factor.org is?

I'm not able to get in either with Authy, SMS, or a call back.  I've been using it successfully for the past few months, so this seems like a system issue.  Best to just email support to let them know, and hopefully they will fix it soon.

1) yes
2) each one should be consistent, but not all may share the same algoritym
3) good idea to keep a copy of the one you used initially
4) yes

IRS hasn't ruled yet, but I would be surprised if they were not treated like stocks.  In which case, you will have to keep track of the cost basis of each BTC when it was acquired, and when it was sold, or used in a transcation.  Messy.
And it will get messier since the price of BTC is all over the map at any given instance across the various exchanges.  So, if I buy something for BTC, which exchange price do I use?  Is the merchant required to disclose the final fiat price?
What is the cost basis of a mined coin?
Lots of questions that the IRS is hopefully working out so that we can get some clarity.

Focus on the reality that regular people will begin to understand how much of their money they are paying in transaction fees, annual fees, product markups to pay the credit card fees, etc.  As these realities become more evident (and vocally articulated by bitcoin users), people will want to switch to bitcoin.  At the same time, new startups will be backed by serious VC money to make the current complexity of bitcoin much more approachable.  It is very hard to image that these things won't happen, and then there will be an exponential uptake in participation.  These executives will not want to be left behind.
In fact, you should challenge them to try to find out how many resources they are currently investing in innovating in financial transactions.  My bet would be approximately zero.

I appreciate the clarity.  I think I'm understanding this better.  Let me describe a detailed scenario explicitly to see if I've got it.
I have a paper wallet (PW) with an address (pwA) and a private key (pwK).  The private key is encrypted with BIP38 security.  Let's say it contains 5 BTC.
When I import it into my blockchain.info account, I will first be asked for my security passphrase, and that private key (pwK) is now in the blockchain.info wallet.  Are the 5 BTC still still associated with the pwK private key?  Or are the 5 BTC already moved to another address in the blockchain.info wallet?  (I would think they are moved, but I'm not sure.)
If the  5 BTC are still in the imported address (pwA), when I want to send some of those BTC, will i need to use the security passphrase that is associated with that private key?  I would hope not, because it would start to become complicated to keep track of which passphrases are part of which address in the wallet.
A better question is whether all of these nuances are explained anywhere else.  I can't seem to find it.

Natanael_L, thanks for the explanation.  Just to be clear in my understanding of your answer... an imported address pulls in the entire address and its contents?  Does that mean that when I look at my addresses in the wallet, I will see the same address in the blockchain.info wallet?  Will I then still need my passphrase for the imported private key that is now in the wallet?  That does not sound intuitive, or maybe I'm not understanding it correctly.

This is very cool.  Thanks.
Here is what I tried, which prompts just a few more questions for more learning.
I used bitaddress.org to create brainwallet private key (K1) from a complex passphrase.  I then used bit2factor.org to encrypt K1 and it generated a new address and private key (K2).
I then tried to import K2 into Coinbase, but it was rejected due to being the wrong format.  I then tried to import K2 into my blockchain account, and that worked fine.
1) Is it safe to assume that (just like I experienced with Coinbase) any system that does not incorporate BIP38 will not be able to use the new encrypted key?  (Since it starts with a 6 instead of a 5, it will just be rejected?)
2) In my test I did above, I used a particular brainwallet complex passphrase in bitaddress.org to generate my private key (K1).  I then used a different passphrase in bit2factor.org to create the encrypted key (K2).  Is there any reason that I should not use the same passphrase for both parts of the process?  It would make the whole process easier to remember and manage.

I love this idea.  However, I wonder how the transaction price in equivalent fiat currency would look differently to the buyer and seller relative to their exchange's BTC prices.
For example, if a merchant manages their BTC at BTC-e, then their BTC have (as I am writing this) a value of $651.  I want to buy a new Intel SSD Drive from this merchant.  The same merchant sell the drive on Amazon's merchant program for $770, so they price it for me at 1.1828 BTC.  At the moment, the buy-price at Coinbase is $711.  For me to spend the required amount of BTC from Coinbase, my replenishment cost would be: 1.1828 * $711 = $840.97.  I would be much better off just buying the SSD drive from Amazon directly.  (And if Amazon had their own stocking of that item, they would vey likely undercut the merchant's price anyway.)
So this difference in exchange prices will force a careful look at the relative pricing to fiat.
The small purchases get penalized by the transaction fees, and the large purchases may possibly get penalized by echange price differences.
