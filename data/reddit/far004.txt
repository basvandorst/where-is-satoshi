You might want to ask this question in the subreddit for an accurate answer. I don't want to mislead you, as I am not sure on how they handle things for first buy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:03:46
Yes, the notice seems to have gone.

I think everyone should switch as soon as possible to a smaller unit, whatever that be...

I have bought from coinbase and it was some time ago, so, I don't exactly remember. Also, I waited for more than a month after my first buy, so, didn't face this problem.
Finally, how exactly is your reply relevant and adding anything to this discussion?
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:01:57
That is my understanding. However, if you are not completely verified, I am not sure how does that apply then. If you are verified, you can buy some instantly.

China bans bitcoin... again!!!

You can buy right after and it does not take 30 days for the bitcoins to arrive in your account., it takes about a week.

Will like some, if I am not late...

I would like an invite as well. Thanks!

I know that it does not solve the problem but perception does matter. However, educating new adopters is the way to go in the long term.
I just switched my wallet to mBTC, it is definitely easier to comprehend now...

Guys we are developing a strategy on the chat. Just keep things clean for now and we can start working once the script is ready...

Can you come over to the chat and discuss it there? Someone is already working on a script. It would be nice to have only a single script and no in-fighting.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:04:14
Some folks were running a script that had a hard coded font size in it. If those scripts are still running, you will basically be fighting against them...

This seems fun! I am going to replace some blue with black and orange.
