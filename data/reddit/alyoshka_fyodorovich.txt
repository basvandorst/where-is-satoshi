Well you can do it in monero just not broadly. They have a view key which, when given to someone else allows them to see your transaction history without being able to actually spend any outputs.
Not exactly the same, but it would provide some transparency to people. Useful especially if you were a charity or something.
edit: oops, I see hybridsole already mentioned the view key

General things? No.
Storing or transferring wealth outside the government controlled financial system? Yes.
You think there isn't a market for that?

Foolish in what way? Most people who invested in btc have been outperforming every other asset class on pretty much every time frame &gt; 1 year.

To each their own I suppose. Bitcoin does things that nothing else can, censorship resistant value transfer being the main thing.
There is value there, but it seems some are unable to see it. meh.

You aren't describing only pyramid-schemes, you are describing pretty much every market ever. Of course the last people in during a bull market lose. Same thing happens in the stock market, forex, gold, etc. Now as you said, the people who were selling at the top are buying again at 6k. Order books are looking fairly thick below 6k. Dumb money won't get in again until we cross 10 or 20k and the process will repeat all over again.
Bitcoin is being used and adopted, I think you are just using incorrect metrics. Bitcoin doesn't need to be a currency, it just needs to be an asset outside the legacy financial system with a unique value proposition. If we keep seeing the market cap increase 10x every few years, it will keep attracting more capital over time.
I don't mind if you think it won't or whatever. None of us can really see the future, I just take exception to the idea that the whole thing is built on manipulation only when the evidence over 10 years shows otherwise. This market certainly has its fair share of manipulation, but it is easy to see that there is a lot more here than that alone.

Ok. Bitcoin has done very well for me so far, we'll see how the future goes. Good day to you sir.

The Dao and the resulting eth split was what got me as well. Sadly that means I sold all my eth prematurely, but fortunately it means I don't have any now :P

Here is the book used in the course:

Bloat because confidential transactions are larger in size per transaction, thus resulting in a much larger blockchain size over time. Bitcoin is just a bit over 200GB, while monero is already at 60GB, with a lot less transactions. Fortunately they are working on some efficiency gains through something called Bulletproofs that should reduce the transaction sizes fairly substantially.
I'm not sure what they are referring to in regards to transparency.

I read the article and don't think much of it. Reads like an obvious shade piece. What if I told you that there is manipulation in all markets. Yes, all of them.
You sound pretty smart though, so I'm guessing you are selling and buying back on a daily basis and making a fortune like you said. You must be loaded now.
I wonder if you'll be here during the next inevitable bull run, or if you'll pop up only after that bubble pops.
Doesn't seem like you know much about bitcoin in any case, but you could consider reading a bit before forming an opinion from a shitty washington post article:

How many heads do you have? And who are you to laugh at people adopting masts? Some of us live on the coast you know.

That debate was with John Corvalho, not Richard Heart (Heart did a different one).

I don't think fluffy's stepping aside had anything to do with the asic thing. I'm pretty sure he supported the movement actually. But either way it looks like there is discussion around moving towards asic-friendliness eventually, and probably pretty soon at that.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:04:01
Pretty much

1. The fee. You can likely get into the next block for around 50 sats/byte right now, which is going to be less than 2.00 for most transactions.
2. The fees don't make it unusable.
3. Lightning is not too complicated to ever work.
4. Store of value is relative to time horizon. It certainly is volatile, but most people don't care as long as it performs well over time. Crypto is high risk...nothing new here.
