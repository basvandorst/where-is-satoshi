Im not looking anyone to pick up the luggage. Ive reported the bags as missing. I'm simply offering a baggage handler an incentive to speed things up. I don't have anything particularly valuable in there except stuff thats not replaceable. Family photos, university certificates etc.

Brad, maybe you should make a plea to Mark to tell the truth about how he lost everyone's money.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:29:53
Apologies for the delay in replying. The emissary and I went out in Tokyo last night and i only just got up. I spoke with the “early adopter” last night by telephone and he asked for the video not to be released yet. It contains personal details of his business with Gox, and he wants to find a resolution first. This may change. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:22:56
I've used them on multiple occasions and found them very good. Although, this report is worrying, so you haven't received any response to the support tickets at all? I did notice they changed the bank account number at oner stage. Would that be a factor?

I think this wins the funniest comment prize. Laughed so hard. If only i had the footage.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:04:24
Great work!! haha
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:23:07
I haven't given them a good test drive yet; hold on, ill stick them on now and do a few laps around the office.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:21:04
I am sorry but Mark has your coins now.
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:03:40
Great work guys! keep up the pressure. Hopefully they'll do the right thing and return everyones BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:52:49
It is worth pursuing. The unfortunate thing is though, most of the circumstantial evidence comes from the mouth of Mark, and he is a liar.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:07:13
Extra-ordinary; at the time of writing they were missing approx $750m and they thought it wasn't worth mentioning.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:51:26
Too late Mark, they are already talking.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:39:22
Maybe it was necessary as a plea to the other exchanges for help. I reckon this was authored for them. A final act of desperation by Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:57:08
I'm guessing Gox's lawyers have their hands full already.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:49:52
You send your exact measurements, and they make them to your size. I agree, it is a bit of a gamble buying clothes or shoes online, especially from somewhere so far away. It paid of this time though.
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:10:38
Can you please make a definitive statement on this? along the lines of "no person who has contributed to, or is involved in this project is aware of any information that would suggest MtGox bitcoins have been seized by a government authority". 
I would use this service to trade my trapped coins, but i am concerned it may be set up be people who have more information than me.

I always wondered what a ponzi scheme SWOT analysis would look like. Now i know.

After seeing an article on Coindesk about how an ordinary Iranian shoemaker was dealing with the fallout of international sanctions using bitcoin, i decided to give them ago and see if the shoes could make it all the way to Australia. At first, they didn't have any shoes i liked, however they were more than happy to introduce a new style based on a photo i provided. Here is the original article:  
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:18:26
Hats off to you lads! The live stream is a brilliant idea! Any ideas what the withdrawal limits are going to be 2mw? I'm guessing some ridiculous amount like 4 BTC a day, and 40 BTC a month. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2014-06-03 03:21:54
I recommend this approach, it worked for me.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:08:19
check their website; its persianshoes.com i think.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:25:01
I posted this article because I believe it is in the public interest for people to know the information I obtained on my trip. In particular, the information obtained in the Q&amp;A, and also the fact that the big players are affected by this as well. I have no interest in the personalities involved. As of two weeks ago, I didn’t know who this Mark guy was.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:53:17
What are you talking about you clown? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:52:53
I actually visited Iran in January and found widespread opposition to the Iranian regime amongst normal people. Even the mullah's sons and daughters were rebelling against the theocracy which has them deeply worried. However, this was matched by their equal disdain for the sanctions regime. Their daily lives are made harder because the elites of both Iran and the US can't cut a deal. Hopefully that will change.
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:44:50
Well, as you can see lightin242, i'm now sitting beside you again at the hotel. Just my luck; the worst snow in Tokyo in 45 years. Got stuck in a taxi for 6 hrs on the Motorway and had to walk for another hour to get off it. Will try to leave again 2mw.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:19:59
Nice, they sort of match your carpet too.
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:30:16
i went there and sat in the lobby until they spoke with me.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:54:19
Is this some sort of joke? Are you the same delerium from IRC who was representing MtGox? Informing everyone that things were fine and not to panic?
What is your connection with this buy out attempt? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:00:41
Not sure actually, the persian shoes guy is actually on reddit, maybe he can answer.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:34:35
Charlie, did you ask Mark to publicly prove MtGox's solvency? Its easy to do and MtGox did it before using their internal BTC wallets. Are you concerned that you are being led up the garden path?
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:26:46
I don't break laws, therefore i don't worry about watch-lists.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:42:40
Folks, a couple of people have made legitimate comments regarding the necessity of posting a BTC address. On reflection, i did not post this report for financial gain. Any donations recieved to the published address will be donated to charity. I haven't decided which one yet. But when i do, i will post it here and you can check it out on the blockchain. Thank you for all the comments.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:18:02
I think you could be onto something here, the shoe maker did have a beard and all terrorists have beards, therefore........... that's it, the shoes are going back.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:10:32
I spoke with a NAB business relationship rep and he said NAB aren't prepared to accommodate any other BTC exchanges at the moment. The impression i got was that they were just about tolerating Coinjar. I think they agreed to take them on before they realised how big bitcoin was about to get and the regulatory questions it raised.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:49:13
Is this ethical? Roger Ver has a certain status with MtGox. If they do fold,  one could speculate he may receive preferential treatment in retrieving his BTC balance.
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:59:57
You'll soon be able to bet on this
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:43:31
I have a lot of BTC stuck on Gox and I want the truth no matter how ugly it is. We shouldn't be treated like children. No more lies, no more cover ups, just the facts. twobitidiot is doing the right thing, lets end this charade here and now.   
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:34:02
Well done mate; its important to keep up the pressure. The more they feel the heat, the less likely they are going to do a runner with people's money. If you PM me, i can give you some tips and contacts while you are there.
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:30:25
One thing that surprises me is that they are still making shoes by hand and yet they can compete with high volume factories.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:18:17
You should turn yourself in young man.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:29:08
It wouldn't surprise me if the document was legit. It looks like something an external consultant would draw up. Gox probably shared it with other exchanges and asked them for help. That's when the other exchanges probably threw up in their mouths and decided to hang Gox out to dry with simultaneous press releases.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:39:42
When i went there two weeks ago, I made contacts.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:52:42
Just to clarify, i am not the insider. If i was an insider, i wouldn't be Searching for my Coins.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:47:49
It was clearly an external consultant drafted in to offer a potential solution.

This is a very interesting question crypto. Is it the U.S. or Japanese authorities putting the squeeze on Mt Gox? I have an attorney friend in the U.S. who recently sent me some information suggesting it was the U.S. authorities. I haven't had a chance to look at this properly (still trying to leave Tokyo), but as soon as i do, it might be worth asking a few more questions and get to the bottom of it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:15:55
Sorry, i did a few more laps than i originally intended. It was like walking on clouds. Their maneuverability was excellent; handled the corners superbly. The I.T. lady also said they looked "suave".

I sat on that Hydrant for 3 days during my protest. Pretty comfy as far as hydrants go. Keep up the good work lads! We are all behind you.

The company is called Persian shoes. I believe the guy has responded to a post below. I agree, an Iranian BTC exchange would be very profitable.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:00:05
Great work lads, keep up the pressure.

@_date: 2014-02-28 02:56:46
I was starting to speculate the same. Maybe we are just clutching at straws here out of desperation but i think it’s worth pursuing. 
I did the interview with Gonzague that is mentioned in edit 9 of the original post and I’ve been thinking about it for a couple of days now, and i have 3 things to add:
1.	Here is an elaboration on what Gonzague actually said. "Look, we would love to just tell everyone in the bitcoin community what is really going on, but we really can't, there are ongoing investigations, which we cannot talk about."
2.	The second protester to arrive was told that they couldn't process his transaction alone because that would be "illegal". Initially i thought this was referring to some insolvency law which prevented them from favoring one creditor over another, but as far as i know they haven't filed for insolvency yet.
3.	If you look at the bitcoin days destroyed in the weeks / days leading up to the withdrawal suspension, there are two huge spikes. If you assume these coins moved had a medium age of 1 year, you get almost 730,000 BTC. i.e. divide the total days destroyed by 365. 
Again, this doesn't prove anything by itself, but maybe worth exploring further.

By including Mizuho Bank in the case, Greene has spooked major banks across the world from doing business with crypto exchanges, including here in Australia where NAB bank has just cut off Australia's only exchange. Extremely stupid move.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:11:24
more like the insiders are getting paid off
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:32:08
Roger Ver has a lot of questions to answer
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:26:14
I think there is more chance of that happening in Tokyo right now.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:26:52
Can you ask everyone else involved in the project whether they are aware of any information that may suggest the coins have been seized by a government authority? This is an important point. It would rule out any insider trading for your proposed project.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:26:48
After seeing an article on Coindesk about how an ordinary Iranian shoemaker was dealing with the fallout of international sanctions using bitcoin, i decided to give them a go and see if the shoes could make it all the way to Australia. At first, they didn't have any shoes i liked, however they were more than happy to introduce a new style based on a photo i provided. Here is the original article:  Note: There are currently no trade restrictions on shoes from Iran. However, ordinary Iranian businesses have been unintentionally caught up in sanctions regime as the international finance sector has cut off the whole country as a precaution.

I promised not to say. But apparently he used to have a lot more resting at Gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:20:51
interesting, what do the Iranian authorities make of it all? have they said anything publicly about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:37:58
Apparently if its just one person it doesn't count as a demonstration anymore. Although, i'm not sure if the media scrum counts or not.

@_date: 2014-03-05 00:09:25
Let me ask you a question; are you, or anyone involved in this project (including the Mandalah guy) aware of any information which might suggest the missing MtGox coins may have been seized by any government authority?

Is 180k of Goxcoins moving through the block chain consistent with MtGox explanations? I think we should be careful about giving MtGox statements any credibility.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:10:37
Does the mtgoxrecovery project advocate treating FIAT and BTC holders differently? i.e. BTC holders are not entitled to a share of remaining MtGox FIAT and future MtGox trading revenues. In essence the approach put forward by Adam Levine in the 'goxcoin' proposal.
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:16:50
Or simply use a private coin like dash
