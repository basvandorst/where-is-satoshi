How do you expect the masses to get an uncompromised gpg executable if they can't get an uncompromised bitcoin executable?
Ignoring the unlikeliness of such an adoption, if gpg were to suddenly become the de facto way everyone understood to verify their new bitcoin client, you've just introduced another vector for attack - a bad gpg executable.
If we're assuming everything is still safe right now, then I think the better solution for the masses would be adding upgrade signature verification to the official client, à la Sparkle.

It would be redundant, but not more than the libraries Bitcoin Core already uses, such as libssl, libboost, Berkley DB, or QT. They are all very common and redundant.
This approach worked with Mac for years before the app store came along, and it earned Mac the reputation - even if it weren't true - of being spyware and virus proof.
Perhaps Windows 8/10 store has an upgrade feature that verifies checksums securely, which would make this approach redundant. In which case, the program should be on the app store.
I can only see benefits in such an approach.


Every program that does this makes one less hole. You have to start somewhere.

It would be nice if the old client could verify the signature of the new client. Then, after downloading the client, you open your old client and select "Verify and Install Update". Too late now, but would be good to get into the binary as soon as possible to prevent future attacks.
Edit: A strong mediating step that can be done right now is to force SSL (https) on all bitcoin.org connections. Even state sponsored MITM attacks would have a rough time with that - and if they could MITM an SSL connection then you'd have more than Bitcoin to worry about.
Edit 2: Also, there's a chance this warning was pushed to the site by an old webmaster who just shorted Bitcoin, as [this change]( was suspicious in itself.

When the end game comes, it will be identical.
"Hey Bob, download this free app, and click '*generate address*' so I can scan it."
For 12 bytes more in cost, your $5 transaction will not only send Bob $5, but open a Lightning Network channel! This is called a *Single Funded Channel* because a single source - you - funded the two way channel.
Now Bob is connected through the LN through you! He can send or receive from anyone you have access to, which if you've used the LN for any amount of time, will likely be the entire network.
This $5 transfer to Bob should still be practical despite fees. Segwit has already reduced the on chain fees to super low amounts. While it may be temporary, we saw a block today with 1 satoshi/byte fees. The LN will only reduce the load on the blockchain even further.

And where would he put that money? Into a bank account where he's only guaranteed $250k (through FDIC insurance) if the bank goes under/is robbed/etc? Stocks are far from a sure thing.
Once you have that much money there is no "retiring" your risks. What are his risks? If the price were to drop 90%, he'd have $40M+. If it dropped 99% he'd still have $4M+.

You don't have to reply - I'll just assume you don't agree with anything I say. You seem to come at this assuming Bitcoin is a fraud, so your mind may already be made up up. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you aren't locked into your opinions, and try to answer this for you.


I believe the intrinsic value is in the secure distributed ledger. The title for your house or car that proves you are the owner follows a human chain of trust. This chain is only secure as the least trustworthy notary. Whereas, you can prove, mathematically, that you are the owner of a Bitcoin private key.


There are a lot of valid answers here. The biggest probably being the proof of work that has gone into the network, and the fine tuning of the mining hardware.
If you wanted to rewrite the ledger to give yourself freshly minted coins, you'd have to redo lots of mining. In fact, given that other miners wouldn't stop mining, the cost to make enough of your own miners to outpace the existing well developed mining hardware (while the miners are actively improving their miners at the same time, I might add), would be so great, and the risk so high, that you'd be better off simply mining legitimately rather than trying to rewrite history.
The value of Bitcoin also puts immense pressure on "breaking" Bitcoin. If there were a way to exploit signatures and take someone's Bitcoins, it would have likely been done by now. We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars worth of value - a quarter trillion dollars currently I believe.
Miners use the same proof of work algorithm that users use for their Bitcoin addresses: SHA-256. Algorithm such as this don't instantly break, mathematical weaknesses or flaws are slowly found over time. If a weakness were found, this would be worth millions to miners as they could use it to mine faster. It would quickly find it's way into production. This serves as not only an indication that there are currently no known weaknesses in SHA-256, but also acts as a canary in the coal mine. If such a weakness were to be found, we would quickly know about it. This gives you time to either move your value out of Bitcoin, or for Bitcoin to come up with a solution. Again, this protection is strongest for Bitcoin, because it has the most value, and thus the most pressure for smaller incremental exploits to be exposed/leaked/sold, rather than being held secretly.
Another angle to look at this from is from a development and progress point of view. As someone looking in from the outside, it may be hard to filter out the FUD and the actual truths between the different warring cryptocoins (and they are warring). Bitcoin development has been relatively stable, with no major exploits, for longer than any other cryptocurrency. Segwit, despite all it's controversy, makes smart contracts practical and allows for a second layer to be built on top of the first layer of Bitcoin. Many of these second layer technologies are nearing production readiness. This will allow Bitcoin to not only do things other cryptocurrencies have introduced, but to go even further. A lot of this is still in development, but it's not hard to see the potential. For example, the Lightning Network could easily allow for Bitcoin payment speed and scale to outstrip the entire credit card industry. 
Let's not also forget that Bitcoin has an established "market." That alone is the biggest reason a bottle of Coke is more valuable than that of RC Cola. The two are all but identical, and I've met people who swear RC is better (or Pepsi, etc). Yet Coke maintains its lead.


Don't put too much faith in one man. He can't be that smart to not know his own company deals with Bitcoin. They brokered a huge bitcoin transaction/exchange right after he said he'd fire anyone involved with Bitcoin. People say he just said that to drive the price down before the big Bitcoin transaction, but I think with all the legal implications, had he known about the upcoming transaction, he would have been smart enough to wait until after the transaction to say anything.
I think the real reason a lot of these big companies and established "players" aren't shorting Bitcoin is because deep down, they are smart enough to realize they don't fully understand it. I think it's human nature to make bold statements when you don't understand something. I've done this myself, saying rather boldly, "that's impossible" or "that can't be right," only to be shown that it is possible, or is correct. Perhaps such things are even said as a challenge - a "prove me wrong, please" sort of thing.


Well nothing can last forever, even the USD will go to 0. It may not be Bitcoin, and it may not even be a proof of work system, but cryptocurrency is the future. Mathematical proof that you own what you own is the next logical step past notaries.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:31:55


The counter argument here is that the fees are just growing pains. And that other cryptocurrencies would have similar struggles under this level of adoption. While an outsider looking in might think Bitcoin is stagnating, there's [a lot of development going on](
There are some vocal outliers, but it's generally accepted that fees are too high. There are also lots of people working on solutions. Perhaps that solution will be the Lightning Network, perhaps not, but there's a lot of fame and money to be made in this space.
In the meantime, the price of Bitcoin has put a huge "bounty" on Bitcoin exploits. Any SHA256 weaknesses or Bitcoin related bugs are literally worth millions of dollars. This makes both the Bitcoin protocol and reference client (Bitcoin Core) some of the most closely scrutinized protocols and corresponding pieces of software.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:28
I think it's pretty easy to argue that scarcity is already a property of Bitcoin. There's an upper limit of 21 million Bitcoins, and some 4 million Bitcoins are estimated to be lost by early adopters (when Bitcoin was worth pennies). People like to mention there are 33 million millionaires and only 21 million Bitcoins, but really there are only likely to ever be ~16 million active Bitcoins.
I see what you're saying though, if there were a huge sell off it would put a lot more coins into circulation which makes it less scarce. I think the big argument against this is, as more institutional money gets involved in cryptocurrencies, you're likely to see it swoop in to buy the dips and sit on that extra supply.
Bitcoin has a long history of crashing. That's why the traditional price meme is a [Bitcoin in a roller coaster]( At one point in 2013 Bitcoin lost nearly 75% of it's value *overnight*, falling from $237 to just $67. However, Bitcoin also has a long history of recovering. It took 6 months, but the price did eventually break the previous peak of $237. So even if we can't identify the mechanism, there's clearly stabling forces at work.

In China mining farms pop up around new power plants to use excess electricity.


I don't believe he said ***the***  driving force - I think the main driving force is always going to be profit, but Bitcoin allows them to profit sooner and quicker. So, at least for now, Bitcoin is only *indirectly* driving decentralization of energy production.


Your wording is worse than his! He never said they "build a new power plant because we want to bring in miners." Again, all they are thinking about is profit. Sure some governments might incentivize power plants to try and plan for the future, but it still mostly comes down to profit. And I can all but promise you, when these businessmen are talking about building new power plants, Bitcoin mining comes up. Even traditionally there's talk about how to advertise cheap energy to bring industry into their service areas. And while there might not be a public record of these business meetings, none of this is a secret.


I believe that's what he was saying.


As mentioned, there's roughly ~15 years before a power plant hits full capacity. This point of time is still far off in the future, but I'd be willing to bet companies are more than willing to shift around their mining rigs to places with cheaper electricity. Mining companies have very few employees, and of those, only a small amount of them are skilled laborers. (And we know how cold business can be when it comes to their employees.) Then add in how fierce mining has become, and that all the mining rigs are designed to be portable... No, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see miners move when electricity prices go up.

It's most likely the bitcoins will be sold off, and everyone will be repaid a fixed percent of the combined value of bitcoins *and* USD in their account. As for calculating the BTC in USD, they'll probably use the value of BTC as it was *the day the exchange closed*. Using a live value would be complicated and is likely something they would try to avoid. Using a more recent price would get everyone upset with the date chosen, no matter which date they choose, and in the end, I suspect less trouble will come from of the exchange value the day the exchange closed.

I think the first thing that would happen if a large, and obviously divergent blockchain appeared and dispersed everyone's coins to millions of random addresses, is a hard fork. They'd simply invalidate what would appear to be the first future transaction and the rest of the chain would instantly be invalid.
There are a lot of interesting things you could learn by analyzing the transactions. Of course all of this works better the more mainstream Bitcoin becomes and the more you adopt it in your day to day life.
You could check your balance and see how many of your original coins you have spent before you either died or lost your wallet. If you check the timestamps of all transactions relating to your current private keys, you might even be able to figure out when you die. Even if your private key is handed off to friends or family, they'd probably divide them all at once rather than spending a little at a time, so you'd be able to look for a transaction where everything remaining is split evenly X ways.
Larger transactions in your history could coincide with certain events: a marriage, buying or selling a house, a divorce. You could mark dates on your calendar and if you don't have anything coming up around that time you could consider other events that might cost you. Do you have any uninsured property? Check on that. Do you currently have health insurance? If not, go get some or at least go get a checkup. That sort of thing. Or back to the divorce thing, has your wife been distant? Have you been cheating on her, maybe she knows.
You might even be able to predict the weather based on your transactions. If you get a cup of coffee everyday before work except when it's raining, you could look for days where there's no purchases and you know it's going to be raining - or you're going to be sick. Since payment addresses would likely change you'd have to watch more for the time of the event, 8:15 am everyday for example.
Using this same pattern you could even follow the price of bitcoin by seeing how much your daily coffee costs you far into the future. At this point it doesn't even have to be your own daily coffee purchases. If woot sells new shirts at midnight for $12, all you need to do is find a bunch of $12 purchases that happen around the time the new shirts come out and check those to for repeat transactions (frequent buyers). Even if it's not a shirt you end up following, it should be good enough for following the price. Works better the more price points you can tease out, but I guess your own coffee purchases would be more dependable. Perhaps companies like bitpay would be in a better position to match price to dates.

It sounds to me like a variable size block and segwit would be a good combination. They could even activate at the same time to avoid the hard fork concerns.
If the miners decided to make the blocks really small to force fee increases they would push everyone to 2nd layer protocols (i.e. Lightning Network), and if they decide to make all the blocks 8mbs they will end up empty anyway if the 2nd layer protocols are everything they claim to be.

I feel if everyone picks one thing then we could tell you more easily.
Gavin Anderson has become increasingly less popular, to the point where he's actually hated by much of the community. Personally I'm surprised to see all the vitriol. I think his position on "simply" increasing the block size to 2mb is what did him in. The rest of the core development team is against "just" increasing the block size, and claim doing so would just delay inevitable and unsustainable increases in the future. (Core is attempting to increase the blocksize to 1.7mb and pushing other improvements with [Segwit]( My guess is the anger against Gavin comes from the fear that he could force his ideas on Bitcoin by simply using his popularity and fame.
He met someone named Craig Wright (CW) who convinced him that he was Satoshi. Not only by talking to him about their history, but by signing a message with a known Satoshi block key. Gavin announced to the world Satoshi was back, and then CW failed to any solid proof to the rest of the world - instead making elaborate proofs that ended up proving nothing, and never signed another message, which is what is expected for someone with the private keys of Satoshi. The two most probably theories are that 1) CW was simply a brilliant con man, or 2) that CW was only one part of the original "satoshi team", and doesn't have the keys to the old blocks to prove or sign anything - which would still mean he faked signing a message right in front of Gavin, but allows people to believe CW is Satoshi.
Either way, this pretty much crushed Gavin as everyone started saying he couldn't be trusted, was too easily fooled, etc. Saying his blog could have been hacked to make a post about Satoshi, his write privileges were revoked from git. Sighting his now untrustworthiness, they were never restored. [His activity on github ]( had dwindled off along with his popularity, waiting to push other changes until the block size issue was resolved first. So some claim it's not a big loss, but some feel otherwise.
This all feeds in with the popularity of other Bitcoin forks not intended to run as altcoins, but to replace Bitcoin core. But that's for someone else to explain.

Perhaps I'm using the wrong term, but didn't headers-first greatly speed up the initial block download? I was under the impression that headers-first was what made the official blockchain [torrent bootstrap]( obsolete.
Either way, that's not what I was trying to say. And maybe it's not related to headers-first, but I was under the impression some changes allowed clients to be productive members of the community (ie sharing new blocks) without first downloading the full blockchain. Which would mitigate at least some of the negative side effects of a long IBD.

If faster than light communication hasn't been solved by then (perhaps with some sort of quantum entanglement solution?) then you'd probably just have another crypto coin that works on a slower scale than bitcoin. Kind of like Litecoin, but in reverse. Perhaps adding one block every hour, or even every day (on average of course).
You'd just switch over to your currency exchange of choice and convert your Milkycoins to Earth's Bitcoins. I'd imagine things would be quite stable by then, and if you were one who travels between planets often you might hold some of your currency in both BTC and MLKY.

You are thinking of the slow but gradual theft of coins that happened 2013. What people are referring to is the 2011 event where one of their private keys were stolen and a large sum of bitcoins dumped on the market all at once, causing the price to fall to one cent.
This is similar because neither ETH nor Bitcoin were at fault in any way in the case of DAO or Mt Gox, but due to poor security, coins were stolen and the whole community/market affected. The 2011 Mt Gox crash was actually worse in regards to this than this DAO was.
The fact we didn't hardfork to take back the stolen bitcoins and "set things right" is the silver lining here, and something to be proud of IMHO.

There are a couple reasons I expect the price to fall. The biggest reason is hyperinflation.
Two weeks of miner rewards are collected in just a few days. So the BCH inflation rate is somewhere in the range of 5 to 10 times higher than was originally planned. To make an off the top but conservative estimate in my head, I'd say the BCH inflation rate is somewhere in the upper 20s (&gt; 20%).
And this is cyclic. As the price goes down, to be profitable to mine, miners will have to mine more blocks per hour. So they will wait until the emergency difficulty adjustment makes BCH easier and easier to mine before jumping back over. They are still able to find a point where they are profitable, but only because they are mining EVEN more blocks per minute. All of this will increase the rate of inflation even more.
And to make matters worse for BCH, if this continues, BCH will have a block halving event in as soon as 2 to 4 months. This means miners earn half as many BCH per block than they do now, and will have to wait for even more extreme difficulty adjustments. I'd imagine they could even be mining blocks in just seconds.

Why is noone talking about the hyperinflation going on with BCH right now? It must be at least 20% already. Inflation drives the price down. And it will go *higher* the more the price falls because miners will only switch over when they can mine blocks faster and faster (to stay profitable).

I didn't realize you were referring to a shortage of full archival nodes. Perhaps the official torrent should be resurrected, if for no other reason than just to encourage people to keep the full archive around. Perhaps a quiet update when we hit block 419999 would be useful.
The only complaints I remembered seeing about IBD were on IRC. People would fire up a node, download all the blocks and then shut it down once getting caught up. All without giving anything back. For some reason I had assumed this was fixed when headers-first came around. It's been a while since I heard anyone complain.

If your only source were the Blockstream satellite feed, you could be fed only privately mined blocks. After some difficulty adjustments, blocks could mined by a single cpu miner and fed to you alongside the valid chain. You might not know a longer, more valid chain exists on the internet.
I'll admit it's a bit of stretch, but it is a vulnerability if it's your only source. And it doesn't require Blockstream to be a bad actor, you could have hackers take over the datafeed for example. If you weren't connected to the rest of the internet such news might not reach you.

I don't understand why one should wait to try SegWit. I mean, of course don't go making transactions just for the fun of it. Don't spam the network is always good advice. But if you can use SegWit to pay someone you're going to pay anyway, why not do it?
I think the better advice would be to use SegWit transactions in place of standard transactions whenever possible. These transactions will be "easier" on the network because they are weighted less and allow more transactions per block.

While it is convenient and miners do allow some variance, this is the real reason.
Offtopic, but in the same line of "why" questioning: I've always wondered why a sliding window wasn't used. I realize there's more variance that way, but it's still being averaged out over 2000+ blocks. And if there was a string of randomly long or short blocks, wouldn't the effect be less pronounced with a sliding window?

Technically, it's the longest valid chain. What makes a chain valid is consensus. Anyone could make a longer chain by simply forking and declaring the difficulty to be less. In this case, BTC1 is run on only 162 out of 8843 nodes on the network^[1]( That's less than 2% of the network. That's why I said they dropped the ball on adoption. If all you do is change the rules you're mining with you're no longer part of consensus.


First, let's not put too much weight on this news. Anyone can pay to broadcast data over a satellite. And that's all that's happening here. If someone else wanted to pay to broadcast different block data there's nothing stopping them.
However, Blockstream is invested in Bitcoin and are likely to pay to broadcast whatever helps Bitcoin the most. I don't know how much their business model depends on segwit, but segwit2x is still segwit. My guess is if the core and BTC1 node/support numbers were reversed (or become so at some point) they would broadcast those blocks, but they certainly don't want anyone to think that they would. Bitcoin thrives on certainty, so that's the path they are aiming for, the most certain. Which at this point appears to be the unforked 1MB segwit path.

Thanks for your reply.
I agree the bitcoin relay network sets a dangerous precedent, but with the code for compact blocks looking so promising on git, wouldn't you choose compact blocks over halving the block size? And if the technology/code were there to transmit a 2mb block as fast as a 500kb block, wouldn't a 2mb block be reasonable?
The IBD is obviously too long as is, but I also feel it's less of an issue now that headers-first allows the client to share new blocks with others much sooner.
I just feel people use your analysis of the network as fodder for their own agenda - I see the community being torn in two directions with *absolute statements* when something more descriptive like your reply above is less polarizing when taken within the context of block transmission and IBM.

[But it does.]( There's even a version number for segwit scripts for future upgrades.


First, the second layer is all about smart money. Second, why would you come into and then call Bitcoin "bCore"? I don't go into and call it bCash. If you're trying to convince anyone of anything you don't do that by offending people. I can't tell if you just came here just to troll and get people angry, or if you're just naively repeating things you've heard.
Bad actors can't block your funds any more than they could if they simply didn't exist in the first place. There's no net loss or harm done to the network.
The web-like connection topology lets anyone make nodes. Nodes with larger balances do have more "bandwidth" for transfers, but they aren't favored over nodes with smaller balances when the amount is sufficient. That is the definition of decentralized. Well why would people make a node? Because they collect fees when their node is used. Essentially earning "interest" on their Bitcoins.
As for needing a large number of connections, have you ever heard of the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](
The payment routing I've done on testnet has been able to overcome a surprising number of potential problems. Of course only time will tell how it holds up to a large number of unpredictable payment patterns, but seeing the progress from even a year ago has completely changed my outlook on the Lightning Network.

This. These sites are watching **transactions with fees**. This is an effort to filter out spam transactions and it *does* traditionally work as an indicator of legitimate tx activity. Since otherwise, as says, the mempool sits near full capacity at all times.
I don't blame gmaxwell or others for thinking these charts are 100% FUD though. There seems to be a concerted effort to make this whole block size issue into a much bigger deal. I think a person can't help but get a little jaded. I'm just worried real issues might get overlooked because of all the blocksize FUD going back and forth.
That said, what we're seeing here isn't necessarily an indicator of a problem. Perhaps seeing a pending tx chart with an increasing delta and/or hearing about all of these "pending transactions" causes people who would otherwise send with no fee, to tack on a small fee, thus making the problem look worse than it is by the same metric.

This is by design, but not surprisingly, it's completely exploitable. I believe when blocks are further than 30 minutes apart, on average, for 12 blocks, then the difficulty drops by 20%. I might be off with the numbers, so you might have to adjust them a little, but this is how the miners exploit it:
When the difficulty resets, the miners wait 30 minutes after each new BCH block is found to start mining (they can mine on BTC in the meantime). After 12 blocks the difficulty will start to drop, by 20 blocks the difficulty will have dropped by 80%, at this point the miners can focus on BCH full time and mine the remaining ~2000 blocks in a single day. Then when difficulty resets, just repeat. Each cycle the miners pull in 25,200 BCH. Knowing this won't last they'll want to sell as soon as possible, which at the current value ($650) is about 16.4 million USD of downward pressure on the market. 
At the time I'm writing this, the current BCH mining rush has already taken it's price down from &gt; $900 to ~$650. The miners are getting rich off all the BCH investors and don't have to worry about destroying it in the process because they can fallback to mining BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:27:49
I don't know how it was originally implemented, but if you're just going back and looking at timestamps to calculate the difficulty, doing this more frequently doesn't require more code. Rather than waiting for block count % 2016, you just do it every block.
So I agree fewer lines of code is better, but I'd also argue this results in fewer lines of code. You'd be removing the conditional test and simply doing it for each new block.

There's actually 3 parts to the activation.
For the first part, the miners decided to signal SegWit support. This happened before August 1st, but was assured by the UASF nodes on August 1st.
For the second part, SegWit has to lock in, which occurs when miners have been signaling consistently (95%) over a roughly 2 week period. This is what happened a few days ago.
For the third part, SegWit will activate. This happens roughly 2 weeks after SegWit locks in. This is simply a count down period. Since SegWit is now a sure thing, this is to give anyone else interested an extra 2 weeks to upgrade their client. Only after this happens will SegWit be active on the blockchain.

I feel you have been mislead in many things, but the thing to realize here is this "power" to stream blocks is entirely unrelated to segwit2x adoption. The Bitcoin nodes everyone has installed for years are incompatible with 2MB blocks. Only BTC1 nodes will function with the 2MB blocks. And the miners seem to have dropped the ball in node promotion and adoption. Even if the satellite were to broadcast 2MB blocks, a vast majority of the nodes wouldn't even be able to accept them.

This has become incredibly long, and I think anyone following this conversation has long since moved on. I've had to break my reply down into two parts. Feel free to private message me for an email or even phone number if you'd prefer to continue this conversation in a more convenient manner. Although I suspect neither of us will be able to convince the other of anything.
 &gt; Oh, is that so? I guess I must have been completely misinterpreted the "by working on extending them", as referring to mining. Am I somehow mistaken in my understanding of what (modern) nodes actually do? Could you please then explain what "extending them" means, in the very phrase you quoted?
Initially you said the term or concept of a consensus wasn't in the white paper. It is, and even if the term isn't used frequently, the content of the paper is talking about building a consensus on which transactions are valid. Then you said the concept of "valid" blocks is a brand new, but it's also in the white paper. Then you claim nodes weren't designed to relay data, and the white paper mentions nodes relaying data to other nodes that have been offline. Now you want to know the method of "extending" blocks.
You want to know what nodes do, but now you're asking for the modern equivalent of a node, and then you ask for me to put that in the context of the white paper. In the white paper they are gathering and verifying transactions, relaying those transmissions, relaying blocks from the blockchain, and using their CPU to work on Proof of Work. Using the literal definitions from the white paper there aren't any miners left, and what we have now isn't even Bitcoin. The white paper never accounted for GPU, FPGA, or ASIC mining. It even used the term "one-CPU-one-vote."
This is why I've been talking about Bitcoin in practice vs in the white paper. The nodes have diverged; they have specialized. Some focus on relaying data, some are just used for transmitting transactions, and others focus on proof of work. This is the reality of Bitcoin. For some reason you keep chasing something from the white paper with this line of questioning.


This only proves my point. Satoshi didn't foresee anything surpassing CPU mining when he wrote the original white paper. Since everyone has a CPU, why wouldn't a node also mine? The nodes have become more specialized than just general purpose all-in-one nodes, but even nodes that don't mine still provide value to the network.


I'm not sure what we're defining a "full node" as. Do you mean a node that has the full blockchain but isn't mining? I think the paper failed to predict the specialization of nodes and their benefits. But this specialization doesn't make them less of a component to the network. If you want to argue that users weren't *ever* intended to run nodes, I think the one-CPU-one-vote shows that it was at least the intent to have some of the more advanced users doing so.
As far as the section on SPV, he obviously wanted users without a PC or without any technical knowledge to use Bitcoin, and this facilitates that. It's suggested that businesses without such access (a PC or the technical knowledge to run a node) would want to acquire it as opposed to using SPV.


This is in response to what users see as valid being important. Users are what give Bitcoin its value and purpose. If you were a miner and decided to suddenly double your mining reward, Bitcoin hasn't changed for a vast *vast* majority of users. Even if you suddenly brought 100 times the hashpower of the entire network online with your change, everyone else still thinks of Bitcoin as it was before your change. It's unsatisfying to say, but what users see as Bitcoin defines which chain is really Bitcoin. And the name carries a lot of weight. That's why the BCC people freak out when you call it BCash. They are quick to claim it's the "real" Bitcoin.
I'm worried this is the hangup we're having. I don't believe any individual component of the network has control over the network as a whole. I would hardly call it a proper system of checks and balances, but I do think this standstill Bitcoin's come to is better than either the miners or one set of developers running rampant with what appears best from their point of view. And I think nodes adoption of new rules and its propagation or lack thereof of blocks is as much of a feature as it is a problem.


But the problem is it's only take two miners to go off on their own and making a chain with the most work and claim their definition of Bitcoin is the real one, when almost no one else is changing their definition. To use your own words, "it just won't be Bitcoin." I feel this is where segwit2x has developed a problem. A small group of mining pools and businesses have signed up. Most users don't query the miners directly for their balances, and most of the businesses listed don't seem to be wallet services (although I do see a few exchanges, which will be important). But I was really hoping to see a list of wallet software which had agreed as well. I've been wrong before, and maybe this will be all it takes, but it really feels like a disaster on the horizon.

I think a lot of people there have traded their BTC in for BCH, or are buying directly into BCH. So far it's following a traditional alt pump where everyone tries to get rich by saying it could be the next Bitcoin, only this time it's based on a simplified version of Bitcoin (the argument against being that it's an overly simplified version at the cost of second layer development). So people who have traditionally not bought into the get rich quick schemes are jumping on this. I'm not saying that's everyone's motivation, and this is only my opinion, but I feel it's the largest motivating factor for what you're seeing.

These things *should* just balance out. BCH is a smaller market. As miners switch over to mine it, they also switch over to selling it. This isn't a huge amount of downward pressure but with a smaller market it's likely to adjust the price back downwards. For example, if 30% of the hash power jumped over, they'd find blocks in about a minute, this would result in about 750 of BCH mined an hour. Since the motivation for the switch was more money and not philosophical, they'd probably be selling most of that, which would put ~18000 BCH on the market each day pushing the price back down.
I doubt there'd be much of a switch by the big pools, due to the possible risks related to such speculation and the affect it might have on their longer term profits of Bitcoin.

The section I quoted is *literally* talking about nodes **relaying** data to nodes that have been offline. The line before section I quoted is:


Those nodes are literally relaying data. I don't understand why you are even trying to argue the point. I think what you're missing is this paper isn't just describing miners, it's describing a *network*.
Users are just as important as the miners. If users' software (or whatever interfaces) don't see the block as valid, then in their reality, it isn't valid.
For example, if the miners suddenly forked to change the proof of work, it wouldn't mean anything for the rest of the network except that the miners disappeared. Sure the rest of the network could change to accept this new rule, but it could just as easily agree on a new proof of work that didn't put a few powerful miners in charge of their entire network. (Perhaps with something that gives weight back to general CPUs over ASIC farms?) It would require *just as many* nodes to update their rules for either solution. And even without the threat of replacing the miners by selecting a new PoW, there's always a chance the miners would just see no one was accepting their nodes and go back on the change.


Beautiful ideas in theory aren't always as beautiful in practice. Outside forces often cause a certain ugliness in name of practicality. Even this unfortunate 1MB blocksize limit that was hacked in was in response to real world forces. This reality, warts and all, is the *real* Bitcoin.


You can find Bitcoin projects all over the web. I think maybe you are asking for a single source? All Bitcoin node software, no matter who has written it, nor in which language, has the a concept of a valid block, and they use this to build new blocks on previous valid blocks.
It worries me that you are looking for one static undynamic unadaptable definition of Bitcoin. This goes back to my fear of people seeing the Bitcoin white paper as some sort of religious document that must be followed at all costs.


I'm not talking about one client's code. I'm talking about nodes that are compatible with the *network*. Even if you stretch that definition a bit, forks such as BCH and segwit2x have blocks which are valid and those that aren't. And they use their definition of what's valid to continue adding new blocks to their network.


I appreciate your idealism, but technology doesn't stand still. All through history, if technology stopped advancing, it was replaced. Bitcoin has become a living, breathing thing. It has changed to adapt to it's environment (some argue too slowly), and I think this adaptability is healthy. Strictly adhering to one formal design would be the death of Bitcoin.


Oh, I agree. I realize you're saying segwit2x's prospects are underrated, but I feel public opinion has the ability to weigh in heavily on such outcomes. In the end, even the miners are human, and if they are thinking the same thing and one of them capitulates, then it's likely others will as well.
Personally I'd prefer a 2MB block. I've even posted here trying to talk the BIP148 nodes into supporting Segwit2x. But as I first mentioned, I feel BTC1 has dropped the ball in terms of adoption. I was waiting eagerly to see how they were going to promote their client, but I've heard nothing. I even tried contacting them directly with suggestions, but have gotten no replies. I don't see how going radio silent helps their cause. If nothing else it's turned public opinion against them in most public bitcoin forums of discussion.


Yes. And I've also met a fair share of users who don't go to meetups through my listing on localbitcoins. If you are suggesting users in the general public are strong segwit2x supporters, I'm afraid you're in for a surprise. Although perhaps it varies locally. But I've met a lot of users, and it's been my experience that most are clueless as to specifics, and easily influenced by public opinion. Even when they hold strong opinions, they only seem to be parroting what they've heard others say.

I've only seen one BCH block mined by bitcoin.com in the past 4 days: 
I don't see any blocks mined by Antpool on BCH. As far as I can tell they are still mining full speed on BTC: 
Perhaps they have mined some of the "anonymous" blocks we are seeing? And if so, why aren't they identifying their blocks like they are on the main chain?
I only see BitClub and ViaBTC. And ViaBTC has been around the whole time.
This has been the biggest surprise to me. The profitability of mining on BCH has been &gt; 100% for over 22 hours now, and even more so since the difficulty adjustment. But BTC blocks are still coming, on average, in just under 10 minutes. It's been a couple hours now since the difficulty has adjusted for BCH, and none of the larger pools have switched over. It looks like some smaller miners may have switched over, but there seems to be more than short term profits motivating the larger pools.

I think you are missing the possibilities that will have opened up for Bitcoin when segwit has activated. The big thing most often overlooked about segwit is it allows contracts similar those found in ethereum.
I've used the Lightning Network on the testnet and it's amazing. It's as fast as they say. And the system is protected from bad actors with 100% enforceable scripting/contracts. Most of the technical issues that came up years ago have been solved. For example, the timelocked channels design has been replaced by unlimited lifetime channels. Another, the risk of centralization through a "hub and spoke" network topology, has also been solved. Channels can now route your payment through other channels in a weblike structure, going from node to node until it gets to it's destination.

The lower the price falls the quicker this all happened (as you need lower and lower difficulty for miners to switch). And the hyperinflation caused by mining blocks faster will make the price fall faster. It's a tsunami of disaster for BCH and they don't even see it coming.

At first I thought this was a joke, but I see the post is 5 days old and only now popping up as "new."
What's most likely happening is Reddit is thinking your posts or comments are spam and hiding them by default. It's actually quite surprisingly accurate *most* of the time. This means valid posts are often hidden between a bunch of real spam in the subreddit spam filter.
Reddit "learns" which posts are marked as spam and uses that information to further predict which posts to hide by default. Unfortunately, most other subs consider cryptocurrency talk as spam - just like we would if someone came in here and started linking us to websites that sell gold. Other subs mark those as spam and Reddit "learns" to remove those as spam.
I don't know how closely this information is tied together between subs, but from my experience they are connected.

Thanks for the reply. I appreciate talking through this with you.


If there were a difficulty value that worried users and resulted in a call to arms, this value would have the same affect whether you were adjusting each block or only once every 2016. The only difference is now it'd take a full 2016 blocks before people felt secure again.


This is still 2 weeks of blocks (on average), so the term "plunge" feels overly dramatic. It wouldn't adjust by more than 1 in 2000 per block. This is a factor of 0.0005, or one twentieth of a single percent. The variance isn't enough that you shouldn't be able to tell if something has gone wrong.
This does raise question the psychological affects of only adjusting once every 2016 blocks. There's always variance and seeing the difficulty wobble a bit might make them irrationally uncertain. It's also led to long periods of consecutive increases, which might also add to confidence and wouldn't happen with more frequent adjustments simply due to variance.

Part 2


Of course these nodes have a role in the network. When I check my balance I don't connect to a miner, I connect directly or indirectly to a relaying node. Ignoring or discounting the node specialization that's occurred by saying "all they do is X" is a mistake. And while node count is easily manipulated, these nodes do provide a service to the network. It's just really hard to measure.


Since seem to believe the white paper limits nodes to only those who are mining, I'd like to remind you it had the concept of one-CPU-one-vote. And in that situation, a proof of work change could potentially restrict mining to CPUs again.
However, this is offtopic as well. I don't see miners as part of the problem. This was an example I gave as to why you *shouldn't* just change the definition of Bitcoin. It was also an example of how the chain with the most work is arbitrary and based on rules anyone could (but not necessarily should) change.


I legitimately think a 2MB block would be better for Bitcoin, but I do think the miners failing to garner adoption of their BTC1 client and compatible wallets as a big problem. They are a small group of people who have overlooked what I feel is an important aspect to the 2MB change. I don't believe they are bad actors, of course they are incentivised to make the best decision for Bitcoin. I just feel they've dropped the ball, and that this coming fork could be more damaging than then had expected when making the decision due to this lack of continued adoption.


It wasn't a specific definition, I was just referring to Bitcoin "in the wild". The real definition of Bitcoin, as it's become, is what the nodes on the network are running. I'm referring to Bitcoin "in practice". I simply felt you had been mislead as to the importance of adhering to the white paper.


I feel there is more likely a breakdown in communication. But I'll skip over this section if we're in agreement here.


I was pushing for BIP91. I trying to get UASF nodes to support BIP91 and segwit2x. I've always publicly stated that I felt 2MB blocks were better than 1MB blocks. I feel that core has a bunch of developers who are bad at PR, and their idea of showing the market "confidence" is to appear unwavering. I don't believe them to be a bad actor (although I think any group of a sufficient size has people who do more harm than good), and I believe they are also attempting to act in Bitcoin's best interest, just as the miners are. If 2x adoption had been rampant (or does succeed) they will probably cave in the same way I'd expect miners to cave if 2x fails.


That's not even what I wrote. I said "I was referring to the Bitcoin source code. Not the white paper." I didn't know your technical level, so I was trying to communicate that practice trumps theory.


I apologize. I didn't think this was unclear. This is where the term consensus came in, and perhaps what has led us on our chase through the white paper. Consensus is a set of rules enough of the network agrees upon to function as designed. (I feel the design is obvious, to collect transactions, order them on the blockchain, and to relay that information to other nodes so they can use it.) I imagine where we disagree is to what constitutes the network "as a whole." If a majority of the hash power suddenly has a new idea of what a valid Bitcoin block is, but none of the other nodes are relaying these blocks and are outright banning them (as will happen with the current state of things) then they are also not only not relaying these blocks, but they aren't transmitting transactions to them either. In this case, the network is unable to reach a consensus until something else changes.


I've tried to define it bit more clearly. However, unfortunately, this is that fuzzy spot between theory and practice. When two competing chains appear, I think it falls to the market to help decide which is "the" Bitcoin. Something I think we can both agree is dangerous. However, strictly saying whatever chain shows the most proof of work is automatically *the* valid chain also opens up other vulnerabilities. If BCC wanted to have the most work to show they could simply mine only ever 30 minutes for the first dozen or two blocks to drop the difficulty to near nothing, and then blast through the remaining ~2000 blocks at a lower difficulty. (And they could repeat this as often as they wanted.) I see the value in watching the raw hashing power, but this is something that can change at the flip of a coin. If BCC sticks around and the difficulty drops enough, I can imagine a situation where miners see more profit in jumping to that chain to mine a lot of blocks real quick and then returning to the original Bitcoin chain after, temporarily giving BCC the greater hashpower.


I think we would have come to an agreement on many things much faster in real life. It's hard to read the tone of something said through text and some things that may have come across combative might have come across more smoothly in real life.
However, I feel the PR of all this satellite stuff will positively affect Bitcoin in general. People on CNBC aren't going to be saying, "well if segwit2x fails we lose satellite support." And I really don't think the average Bitcoin user is going to take that into consideration. I guess there's always a chance core will stop paying for satellite time if their preferred path/chain fails, but again, I'd just expect them to cave before just shutting everything down and declaring Bitcoin dead.


I just included the people I've met on localbitcoins to say that I haven't really seen much of a difference. Either the quality of your local meetups is higher than mine, or your idea of what kind of "investors" actually risk their savings on Bitcoin is lower than reality. To be fair, I do think localbitcoin users are of higher quality caliber than of the average reddit user. Most of them use a private wallet and have a healthy distrust of putting their coins in other's hands.

I was referring to the Bitcoin source code. Not the white paper. The white paper isn't some religious bible that needs to be followed. However, it's obvious to me now that you've never read the white paper.
**Technically**, yes the term "consensus" is used in the white paper, and in the same context I used it, in relation to *valid* blocks. To quote the white paper:


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
Then you said:


But as seen in the quote from the white paper above, it's the chain with the most **valid** work.


It's not new. Again, it's in the white paper.


I was reading a post in a couple days ago about trying to get BCH get more miners or hashpower or something, and people were calling segwit2x "dead in the water".  From many people's point of view, they feel the 2MB fork is likely to fail. I thought this was accepted in both subs. I'm not saying one path or the other is 100% likely to succeed, it just seemed public opinion was that segwit2x had an uphill battle. If the 1MB chain ends up dead in the water then it's obviously no longer the "most certain" future.

You are routed between hubs, and while some may be direct paths,  this is not a requirement. You will be routed through other channels if need be. This is closer to how the internet works than how traditional banking works.
Imagine if the government tried to shutdown thepiratebay.org for example. Would that stop you from getting torrents? No, first of all, there are lots of sites that provide the same torrents from the same release groups, and secondly, this did happen, and thepiratebay.org is still there.
Also, you can always just open your own payment channels and even share it with friends (collecting a small fee for your trouble). In fact, I'd expect market pressure will always open paths to wherever you'd like to spend your money.

I see a lot of people comparing layer 2 nodes to banks. But there are actually very few similarities. All of the worst things we've come to hate about banking are gone.
There is no [fractional reserve banking]( ([Here's a good video]( of the problems this causes.)
[Banks manipulate transaction order]( to and get your balance to go negative so they can charge overdraft fees, but these nodes don't have a concept of overdraft fees. Here, if you don't have enough to make a payment, it's simply an invalid transaction.
With banks your [funds aren't available]( for up to 9 days (in the US). With nodes your funds are available instantly. 
Banks have gotten in trouble multiple times for [playing with exchange rates]( to take more of your money. When you are exchanging currencies the nodes you are connected to don't have a say in the rates.
If banking services decide not to transfer your money to someone - and [this has been done for political reasons]( - then you're out of luck. While somewhat related to the off chain crypto service, proposed off chain services like LN can route your money like the internet routes a packet, so if a "PayPal node" in your "group of nodes" doesn't like what you are collecting donations for, then your payment can go through someone else who is willing to send it. And due to the fees they collect, there's financial motivation to do so.

He's not saying something *is* going to go wrong, he's just asking why you say there's no *possible* disastrous result. It's your claim, and it's stated like a fact, so him asking how you arrived at that conclusion is a fair question.
However, since you said you were genuinely interested, I can provide a possible disastrous result. 
At the time of segwit activation, Wu brings more of his hashing power to LTC, bringing him to 60% of the network. He focuses on mining the segwit fork, with empty but completely valid segwit blocks and refuses any new blocks that aren't empty. Since he has the majority of the hash power, the longest valid chain of the segwit fork would have no transactions at all. This would freeze all LTC on the segwit fork but leave the non-segwit fork functional.
It'd be siege warfare. A currency you can't use is no currency at all. 
At the end of the day an exchange is just another business, and I won't I spend much time speculating how far the exchanges would go if the price of LTC tanked. If the price dropped fast enough I could even imagine a "roll back" to the price right before the fork with everyone's coins as they were right at the time of the fork, but now on the non-segwit blockchain.
Users that eventually get tired of waiting and "just want to use their LTC" would start transacting on the the non-segwit fork. It wouldn't hurt that transactions from an LTC address used before segwit activation to another such address would be valid on both forks, but only show up confirmed on the non-segwit blockchain. They wouldn't even have to resend the transaction in that case; they'd just have to check a site following the old blockchain. It's likely that even the withdrawals and deposits panic'ed users had been attempting with the exchanges would be going through on the non-segwit blockchain.
I wouldn't go as far as calling that a *worst* case scenario. A worst case version of the above scenario would be Wu preventing all LTC transactions on both forks indefinitely, just to spite everyone. Users (eventually?) panic and the market price plummets to 0 and LTC gets delisted from all the exchanges. Software and sites dealing with cryptocurrency stops supporting LTC. Online wallets shutdown. Once interested parties (users, developers, and businesses) move to other cryptocurrencies leaving LTC a [broken shell]( of it's former self.

The post you replied to is gone now, but I assume it was blaming Roger. While there's nothing to point to him, there certainly *are* bad actors at play here. It simply isn't true that all these "spam" transactions are legitimate but poorly misguided.
The reason they look like real transactions is because they *were real* at some time in the distant past. Look at the nlocktimes on these bitcoin transactions. Some of these were from years and years ago, when fees were much lower or even free.
I too tried to consolidate my UTXOs at points of lows fees in the past. I put my transactions in at very low fee amounts, and they didn't clear. Everytime the mempool fills up with "spam" transactions I see my old transactions pop up on my wallet again. I like to keep my wallet "clean" and zapwallettxes after they show up. At one point these TXs had been out of the mempool globally for multiple years, but now, during times of high spam, I get those old transactions back repeatedly. 
I've even had **free (0 satashi/byte) TXs** that are *years old* being confirmed as recently as 3 to 4 months ago.

Fiat currency can be minted for free. If distributed digitally to banks, the cost is literally 0. Each one dollar USD bill costs less than 5 cents to print.
Minting (mining) Bitcoins has real costs. There's not only the cost of the hardware, but the electricity costs. I believe, in a recent interview with John Mcafee, whose company MGT Capital Investments mines Bitcoin, said the electricity costs alone were over $1000 a Bitcoin.
With fiat currency the government can always decided to issue more currency and dilute your holdings. Sure there may be politics involved in the decision, but by definition, the supply is controlled by the government.
There's a fixed supply of Bitcoins. And yes, someone could fork Bitcoin to issue more, but even then there aren't more Bitcoins, just more Bitcoin-fork coins.

That article doesn't sound like it leans one way or the other. It all depends on if the IRD declares Bitcoin to be a "security." Which is a tough one, especially since everyone has a slightly different definition. Typically, stock in a gold fund would be a security, but an actual gold bar wouldn't. However, IRD broke that traditional line with gold bullion.


This implies, if Bitcoin is seen as providing "other benefits," it won't be considered income. Looks like what it will come down to is if IRD sees Bitcoin as an investment or a useful currency. And it might be both depending on how you use it - like we have in Japan and Australia.

If you fired up an old Bitcoin node, say 0.10.0 for example, you'd sync and follow right along with the latest Bitcoin Core developments all these years later. Your client wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, Bitcoin Gold fork, or the Segwit2x fork. It would follow the original chain, noted as the furthest removed "fork" (Segwit1x) in the first picture. This is what the second picture is saying.
The owner of Bitcoin.com, creator of the first chart, has made a public bet of 1000 Bitcoins (currently over 6m USD) that Segwit2x will overtake the current chain. The futures market, which allows people to trade on the upcoming fork ahead of time, shows the opposite happening. So it's in his best interest to change the narrative.
I think the censoring has been toned down a lot now, and it happens less and with less abstract rules. But initially some of the censoring that happened here left a bad taste in my mouth. I tried the other sub for a while, but I thought the r/btc users were unusually hostile and found myself coming back here for discussions. I'm still not completely happy with how this sub is run, but I don't think it deserves the hate it once earned.
Ironically, seems to be against BTC now, and in support of BCH (aka Bitcoin Cash). One thing the BCH fork does is raise the blocksize to 8MB, which you could argue is *closer* to Satoshi's original suggestion, but it also messes with the difficulty adjustments in a way he was strongly against. Without another hard fork to fix this difficulty change (called the EDA), there's a good chance BCH will hit their halvening years ahead of schedule, and complete their mining much further ahead of schedule. This is a problem as there isn't enough of an economy established yet to incentivize miners to mine blocks without fixed payments. This change also means blocks are mined at less than a minute for days, and other days blocks are further than an hour or two apart.
Not to get too technical, but the big argument in favor of not having an unlimited block size is that it doesn't scale well. With a 1MB block size, there's a max of 7 transactions per second. On blackfriday there's 150m transactions, or 1736 a second. So the blockchain is growing 1GB every 4 seconds. This is roughly 38TB a single day.
Again, oversimplifying to keep things from becoming too technical, Segwit, while being backwards compatible, makes it easier for offchain transactions, such as those on the Lightening Network. (There was some FUD about the Lightening Network (LN), but it's open source and doesn't give any of the developers kickbacks or patent payments or anything like that. Banks hate it as much as they hate Bitcoin. Etc.) The offchain transactions that are possible with something like the LN can easily crush the current credit card processing limits with just the 2 to 4mb blocksize limit segwit grants.
The two subs still come down to the Bitcoin Core developers vs not. Core is still the most actively developed, and best tested Bitcoin node. The core git repository is literally 1000s of commits ahead of it's closest fork, the segwit2x client. Other attempted forks have suffered from lack of development, bugs, and exploits. This has kept the core client in the strongest position. This is why there isn't much market confidence in the segwit2x fork. A dangerous exploit which could have resulted in the loss of people's bitcoins was recently patched out of the segwit2x client - thanks to core developers btw.
There have been so many attempts from different parties to take control of Bitcoin. But there's so much money and power involved, this is bound to happen. It makes it really hard to judge people's intentions and can lead to some bad actors. I feel the core developers are still working with Bitcoin's best interest in mind, and will win out in the long run. But if not, all the Bitcoins you had at the start of the year will also exist on multiple other chains and you can just choose to use one of those instead.

Everyone in here is complaining about exploiting children or karma whoring or whatnot, but the real issue here is that the Lightning Network *hasn't arrived* yet. The Lightning Network developers keep saying it's not ready, and not to use it on the mainnet. Yet we just keep seeing posts like this and people setting up nodes on the mainnet.

Bitcoin futures allow people to trade tokens before the fork. The market isn't showing confidence in the segwit2x branch and pricing it at a lower price point than the original chain. A 2x Bitcoin is worth roughly 15% of what the 1x Bitcoin is worth.
I'm not sure exactly why there is a lack of confidence, but it's probably because it just doesn't have the developers. The segwit2x fork is thousands of commits behind the original client, and thanks to the eyes of a few core developers, a bug was recently patched out of the 2x client that could have allowed people to lose some of their Bitcoins.
Another fear is there's been talk by some of the miners about extending the total number of Bitcoins to keep paying miners indefinitely. Bitcoin being inflation free adds to it's value (scarcity) and so talk of changing that could also be driving the 2x price down.

If the mood around here can be generalized, then most people are buying into Bitcoin to sell off the S2X "dividends" after the next hard fork.

This is where your misunderstanding comes from. You can send money to anyone on the Lightning Network, even with just one open channel. LN nodes are connected to each other in a mesh-like pattern, and payments are routed to other LN users like your packets are routed on the web. 
So even if you only open a connection to your favorite coffee shop, you can send payments to anyone in the global Lightning Network. Of course if your coffee shop goes out of business or closes their node for some other reason, you'll have to open another channel, but your wallet will probably do that transparently for you next time you try to make a transaction.
It's also worth mentioning, for 12 bytes more in cost, a regular Bitcoin payment/transaction can be converted into a LN payment that opens a channel. So there's very little reason for people not to open an LN payment channel.

He's clearly faked emails and other materials. So I don't think the con artist title is unfair, even if by some chance he turns out to be (part of) Satoshi.

It feels unfair to call the original Bitcoin a fork. Bitcoin Core is the original Bitcoin project, but as many other Bitcoin nodes and wallets became available, the "core" reference client added Core to it's name help clarify thia ambiguity.
If you fired up an old Bitcoin node, say 0.10.0 from over three years ago, long before last year's forkathon, and before segwit was added, you'd sync up and follow right along with the latest Bitcoin Core node all these years later. Your client wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, Bitcoin Gold fork, or the fabled Segwit2x fork. It may not be as efficient of a client, but you could still make valid Bitcoin transactions with that old client and they would act on the current/original bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:15:39
Sure it's possible. I haven't heard any confirmed reports of anyone doing it. It'd likely be pretty profitable though, so there's a good chance it's been done, or someone is working on it. Especially now that this post has brought attention to a security vulnerability with Amazon's stock. (Ledger really needs to put a tamper proof seal on their boxes.)
If you only replaced the firmware, I believe it would give you a "Not Genuine" warning when you connected to the ledger. But if you physically opened the ledger, you could prevent that as well. They even show you how to [verify the hardware integrity]( if you suspect it may have been tampered with. But these pictures are *also* a good guide of how to make them look after you've tempered with the device.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:37:19


I think, technically, it is. And I don't just mean that is BTC the original ticker. The latest core client has come from an unbroken chain of developers working on the original client. Individual developers were removed at times, but there was never anything like a hack that let another group of developers overthrow the current group of developers. Despite all the controversy, it's been a pretty peaceful transition. And yes, some developers have been removed, Gavin Anderson comes to mind for example, but all of them had stopped committing code to Bitcoin at the point where they lost permissions.
The 0.10.0 client came out 3 years before any of last year's forks, and was also before the controversial segwit was added. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that this particular core reference implementation *was* Bitcoin.
If you fired up that node today, it would pick up from where it left off 3 years ago, and follow along with the same blockchain as the latest Bitcoin Core node does today. It wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Gold fork, or any other Bitcoin fork. You could even send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) with that old client and have it show up on the Bitcoin network and view it with the latest Bitcoin block explorer.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:58:18


BCH did a lot of things that weren't part of the original plan. The emergency difficulty adjustment code that was added specifically broke a rule Satoshi made to help keep the difficulty stable.
I think most people would agree that blindly following the "original vision" would be dangerous. For example, Satoshi's original white paper said one CPU one vote. It never even imagined dedicated mining hardware. Things change and the software evolves both when the network grows and when the network is attacked. In fact, Satoshi himself added the 1MB block limit. Who's to say that if he were still around, that he wouldn't still be happy with that limit.


Why? I think that's pretty clear. The 0.10.0 client came out years before any of last year's forks and before segwit was added. I doubt you could find anyone who would argue this wasn't Bitcoin. If you ran that old node now, it would follow right along with the same blockchain as the latest Bitcoin Core node does today. It wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Gold fork, or any other Bitcoin fork. You could even send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) with that old client. That seems to give a pretty legitimate and common sense claim to the name.

I feel the word "faith" is calling segwit into question. It feels a bit FUDdy to me. Segwit is already working fine with litecoin.

Yeah. Seriously.
2010's range was $0.05 - $0.39. Probably somewhere around $0.25 is more realistic. So even if heavily invested meant just $5,000, that would have bought 20,000 BTC, and would be worth just short of $10 million today.
And while I don't think I'd count anything less than $5k as a heavy investment, for some people a heavy investment would be ten times that, $50k, and would be worth just short of $100 million today.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:20:30
Why would they see it as a weakness? I think it'd just leave the miners uncertain if they could have pulled it off without the rest of the community. If it goes through without any help surely they will get a big boost of confidence. "Look what we can do all by ourselves!"
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:43:32
"End goals" refers not to the motivation, which I agree with you on, but the means of reaching those goals and the results hoped for. In this case aren't they nearly identical? The code itself would only need a small tweak to trigger it earlier when BIP91 activates. All the rest of the logic would remain the same.
I realize BIP91 is the miner version of BIP148, and I'm not talking about adapting BIP91s goals, or even enforcing the miner's block size increase. But from this combative point of view, isn't this your last chance to show the miners they needed the users/community after all? Or to at least be able to say they made this possible for the miners?

The miners are **intentionally mining near empty blocks** when they are found so close together like this. This has nothing to do with the size of the mempool.
When a block is found, there is a period of time where it propagates across the network, being validated. Since miners don't have the full information on the block, they don't know which transactions are included. If they include any transaction that was just confirmed, **any block they mine will be invalid**.
This makes miners **very conservative** about which transactions they mine on until they are sure of the state of the network. The result is small blocks like you see here.

Every time I check for news on Bitcoin all I see is FUD. If the price is increasing, then the price is "fluctuating significantly." And if it's decreasing in value, then the price is "in freefall." I went to search for news about Bitcoin on CNN after Steam started accepting it as a form of payment, and the story that came up was one about a hospital paying $17k in ransom via Bitcoins to receive a decryption key for their maliciously encrypted data.

It's too bad it'll likely turn out to be"unnecessary." It would be nice if we could have an extra check in our UASF client to not only check the time for BIP148, but also check for BIP91 activation. 
Something like:

This is done in case you decided to dispute the sale with PayPal. You could say you got nothing, and it'd be your word vs his - and PayPal is notorious for taking the word of the buyer over the seller. So to protect against this they send you a letter or something random in the mail so they have a shipping transaction to show PayPal if you decide to open a dispute and get your money back.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:33:35
I'm not saying they need to signal BIP91, just start enforcing the segwit filtering when BIP91 activates.
If you're worried about changes to the UASF code it's actually pretty small. There's a pull request by luke-jr [here]( The changes are extremely minimal. Most of what you see looking at the code are tests.
All it needs to do is:


The logic for everything else is the same.

This is what I was hoping for yesterday, and I posted about it [here]( but it never got traction.
There's even a [pull request by luke-jr]( that would allow us to support BIP91, but the politics involved is so overwhelming that I don't expect anything to happen.
I could apply the patch myself and compile my own client, and may still, but it won't make even a tiny difference compared to a public release by someone people trust.

There's a misunderstanding about bitcoin that still gets passed around today - just because you can't follow a transaction, doesn't mean it's private. The blockchain will forever hold these transactions. The blockchain is public, so you can look up any transactions that occurred and follow it.
Right now a company could act as a cash only enterprise and get away with it - maybe - but the proper tools should be able to trace enough of the transactions back to your business. Even if the IRS doesn't have that information right now, they could develop/utilize such tools at any time - and start prosecuting tax evasion fraud at least as far back as 6 years ago. Just think how far Bitcoin itself has come in the past 6 years. It's simply not worth the risk of "going dark."

Once you've sent out your bitcoins you have no way of getting them back.
As a holder of bitcoins, this makes trusting any service difficult. If the owner of that service decides to run off with your bitcoins, you'll have a hard time tracking him down. It also means if the service is hacked and the coins are sent off, your coins are gone.
As a buyer, this makes trusting people difficult. If you send someone bitcoins, let's say for printing 3d things, that person could simply take the coins and run. It's very hard to go from a bitcoin address to a person. In regards to this aspect, "don't trust anyone" means to never assume there's a 100% chance you'll get what you pay for. Always way the risks of a person's/company's reputation with the cost of the service/product.
As a seller, you must earn people's trust. This means starting a new venture like this will take time. You generally have to start low, even sometimes taking a loss on every sale, just to get your reputation established. Once you've established yourself, and have some happy customers who upload pictures or proof, you'll find more people willing to take a risk on you, and you can ask for more in return for your services.
