Pretty ironic coming from a person who's 87 and is still currently working.

Bought a couple of good books with a 15% discount. Purse.io is great indeed.

I don't think bitcoin should be considered as any type of investment.

They seem to only provide forex and CFD. I'm looking for regular stocks.

Since I live outside of the US it seems quite a bit of fees ($10 for card, 3% exchange fee + 3% atm / transaction fee).

It seems like it's the old version still..  new version is v5

Thanks for the feedback. From what I gathered seems like there's an issue for pixel devices. I'll look into it tomorrow and update once it's fixed. :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:47:17
Thanks :) if you got ideas for improvements I'll be happy to hear!
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:22:05
Hi, I added your website :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:00:32
Added :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:36:32
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:12:58
I'll probably create a website version as well in the next couple of weeks
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:34:26
Yeah I was considering it as well. Will be added as well soon :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:16:05
I'll add your website when I'll get home. Please submit it via the app so I won't forget. And sorry but I'm looking to keep the app fair, so I won't sell visibility or featuring.

I made an app that lists all stores that accept bitcoin. Check it out: [NoFiat](
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:08:16
I created an app just for that. Listing all online merchants accepting Bitcoin in a convenient way. Check it out - [NoFiat](

Hi, what is your Android version? Has it happened to you with other apps? When you open the app it crashes immediately or did you perform an action which caused it? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:21:52
Okay I'll look into it thank you very much for the feedback. Can you please tell me your Android version and phone model?
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:19:11
Soon will develope a website version.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:02:29
Hi, thanks for the feedback. I didn't quite understand what you mean buy choosing a store. You mean after you click it?
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:50:32
Very helpful. Might be going with Coinsbank. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:12:44
Hi, I submitted a new update to the Play Store. Please check if it fixed the issue for you.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:48:27
Thank you very much for the feedback. I'll implement your ideas in the next couple of days!
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:14:03
Hi there! I've just submitted a new update which includes a better UI, better user experience and new categories. It also allows you to choose whether you see gift-cards or not. Go check it out and tell me what you think.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:19:46
Great! Will add it once I get on pc
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:45:10
Hi, I've just submitted a new version. It should fix the crash issue. Can you please test and report back?

I think that these kind of news should be put into perspective considering this number represents about 1% of BTC market cap. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:36:22
Big if true
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:29:49
Correct. But you'd pay $2 for a large deposit rather than a small amount, which decreases the fee paid in percentage.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:59:30
Well then he shouldn't complain about that. Much like ATMs that are charging you $1-2 for a withdrawal, you wouldn't (and honestly can't) withdraw $5 from an ATM and expect low fees.

It's an exchange which allows users to buy Bitcoin with Bank transfer and credit card. That's why they need a bank account.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:49:39
Why don't you use a prepaid one such as Xapo or Coins.ph. You pay a one-time deposit fee for the transaction (let's say $1-$2) and a small premium in BTC price (about 3%). So if you deposit $100, you "lose" about 5% in BTC value. Instead of 60% on a $5 tx.
