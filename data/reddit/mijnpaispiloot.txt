"Some mf" is probably just a lot of people wanting to sell their bitcoin. It's not like some giant entity is after bitcoin and "driving the price down", it's just normal market fluctuations of a highly volatile asset.

Bitcoin is such a static coin, ETH consensus/secondlayer protocol can not be implemented. Like DAG protocols totally outperform bitcoin and are totally different. Bitcoin is just a slow as shit 6 hours confirmation time, $10 fee shitcoin.

How is it the most efficient?
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:14:56
Efficiency is measured in something divided by spent energy.
Saying bitcoin is more efficient than gold based on mere total energy consumption makes no sense because there is no comparing factor. 
You can divide government and printing energy expenditures by the total amount of transactions and using that and get a Watts/transaction and i'm pretty sure that bitcoin is exponentially less efficient than fiat. Imagine 10^5 times less efficient, if not more.

That's what i meant, because these numbers show the exact opposite.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:29:37
Plus bitcoin uses less energy than banks, it also does like 1/100000th of the transactions. I think if u do W/tx bitcoin loses badly.
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:35:51
No you are just a retard. You don't understand a)what you're claiming and b)what efficiency means. That tells me that you have had no basic education and that argueing you is a waste of time because stupid people can't be convinced.

You'd only have to understand the basics of bitcoin to use it since the normal banking system is a complex system, but you don't need to know how it works to use it as well. For example me: I have no clue how the blockchain works, how blocks are mined and how pools know what to put in the block. I know that i can send X bitcoins to address Y, like i would send X dollars to bank account number Y. That's the basics and it's pretty much the same as normal banking would go.
You're right, making mistakes is indeed permanent and you will get no recourse. Have you checked out the newest version? it has payment request forms where you can request X bitcoin to address Y that will provide you a clickable link and a QR code that will automatically enter the amount and address in the send form.

Surely it is not knowing bitcoins existence, having the time or wanting to understand it. And also, understand that the age of the tech kids has just started. Older people are (generally speaking) not comfortable with new technology. 
My friends that are around my age have heard of it and are asking me questions about it. I'm not the person who can explain in it detail, so i just send them a link, where they can read about it. I get a lot of "i'll read that later" responses from that. So I guess it's that
* older people are generally not into new technologies
* people want to know, but don't want to spend a lot of time on it
* bitcoin probably spends mouth - to - mouth a lot

Because the best technology has the highest market value right. Im pretty sure you use OSx on you Macbook over windows on a PC; Apple has a bigger market value over Microsoft right? Retard.

It only took 4 days to finally chew into 10sats/byte transactions, how are my bank transactions slower and more expensive again?

He did short it you moron, he sold...
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:34:04
Yes, because at the next pump btc dominance will go from 50% to sub 20%...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:19:02
There isnt fud, the market is uncertain and you are better of selling.

Except for the fact that the person in control of coding is somewhat of the leader of Bitcoin. And he has power over what it does. 
You can ramble about miners not following it, the fact is: they will anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:13:11
or not, you would never know.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:46:00
It's just normal movement, when bitcoin's momentum stalls out it will drop again.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:10:31
But who cares? alts go down when bitcoin goes down, alts go up when bitcoin goes up. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:26:56
Bitcoin loses 50% dominance, regains 3% 
"Bitcoin is fading the alts"

It's much better to have a crypto that only costs you the energy of calculating PoW for your own transaction instead of wasting billions of kW's for calculating useless nonces.
Gold is used for far more things than value storage, it's used in electrical component, energy transfering etc.

So if I say gravity pulls you down, and you say that that's bullshit, i have to prove it isn't. I don't have to prove the obvious facts imbecile.

Those are names, not words
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:41:46
And guess what, litecoin didnt get clogged up and fees remained low. Im no bcash fan but the runup of december showed that an increased blocksize did in fact work.
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:34:07
Because there are other cryptos that are fundamentally better and will be far (and are already) better adopted than bitcoin.
E: Oh shit he's right, quick downvote him.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:47:49
Time will tell, the small amount of businesses that used payment processors for bitcoin are dropping it and a lot of big companies are adopting other cryptos. Bitcoin dominance dropping every week. That's surely a good sign for ol' bitcoin.

They follow the same trend yet bitcoin dominance keeps falling

That 230 year old collapse still collapsing, when will it collapse?

You could buy a 48 inch tv with 1 bitcoin once, now you'll be happy if you can buy a 22 inch second hand monitor with one.
I bought my 32" inch tv for 550 euros 6 years ago and i'll be able to buy a new 32" inch tv for even less than 550 euros.

There are cryptocurrencies that are not slow, inefficient and unreliable.

They were looking at multiple alternative better cryptos.

People who say shit like this have no idea what IoT is, or how it will work.

No one has claimed that until ethereum came to a couple of million, you moron.

Who takes his BNB of Binance?
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:46:17
They already stated they are not going to be using bitcoin as it has high fees and is really slow.
@_date: 2019-05-06 08:26:43
A bit inflated since its on bitfinex, no?
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:14:58
No not bitcoin, other cryptos...

Wow sick man, just over half, that's a lot. Lets compare it to 2 years ago. oh lmao
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:56:28
I've been around since bitcoin was $0.20, no one said that. And that statement alone proves you are not around since 30 bucks.
