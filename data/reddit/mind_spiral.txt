Yeah I looked at the source code, and even copied some of it into jsfiddle with the external URI resources and I still couldn't get it to work. Isn't there some snippet of code I can just use as a function to generate them?

I'm looking to do it in Javascript so that I never see the private keys. I know bitadress.org and brainwallet do this, but I don't know what functions/JS source code to link to to do this on my own

I want to do it client-side (javascript). I looked at the git repo and I'm a little confused with all the files in there. Is there a simpler explanation on how to do this? Is there some function I can just write in the javascript portion of my website?

Wow that was the simplest explanation and it works! Thanks so much.

I'm more looking for someone who would like to work on this as a sort of co-team thing. Any later profits from people using the application would be split.

Yep, I've got that built in. Using multisig signatures if the parties agree to have a third-party arbitrator as a party to the contract

Yeah I understand. That's why I am looking for someone with some free time on their hands who would like to be involved with a neat project, even if just for fun

I'm actually a lawyer myself ;) Trying to integrate bitcoin technology in the legal arena. If you'd like to help or have any ideas for a joint project I'd love to talk.

Yeah I looked at that, but I'm not sure how to use it... What directory do I install it in and then what code do I use to generate the keys?

I'll send you $10 to start via PayPal and you send me $10 worth of BTC once you receive the money, in order to establish trust. After this, I can go ahead and send you the rest of the money for the BTC. Let me know - John

Someone answer this

Seriously? The SEC. This "kick starter" method of funding is NOT a violation of securities laws nor is it anything the SEC would be interested in. Have a downvote.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:33:34
Exactly what section is this a violation of? I looked and couldn't find anything. Unless you're talking about the common law definition of an "investment contract?" And even then you'd be wrong.

Yeah let's all convert our fiat to government e-dollars so we will be guaranteed to lose 5% per year in negative interest.
Great plan.

I heard this criticism when I first started looking into mastercoin. I did a lot of research, and determined that the motivation behind the funding was nothing close to what you're suggesting. It is actually a great way to spark development of a project which would otherwise take much longer.

Can you point me in the right direction for learning how to start mining?
