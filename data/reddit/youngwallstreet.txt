He doesn’t have to care he’s a multi millionaire who makes money using competitor processes to crypto- take a look at the sail boat to steam ship transition! Crypto future of everything money but we still need to wrinkle out the issues

Blockchain is here to stay! Whether bitcoin will be the continued champion as blockchain finds its practical use no one knows! Look at palm pilot and blackberry , they revolutionized mobile tech and were the darlings of the early adoption of mobile smart technology only to be eclipsed and permanently taken over by Apple then android! So maybe bitcoin fails- but paved the way for an eventual winner in blockchain! Once steam engines were adopted, commercial applications for the large commercial sailboat never came back!  Be excited for blockchain and research and stay informed of advances! Companies do not need to adopt crypto! People need to! Look for developing world uses! Most of us missed the creation and the first rise in wealth of crypto , but we are at the bottom of the second wave— back to mobile example- many investors missed out on blackberry , but made vast wealth when Apple perfected the tech— HODL and use the currency you believe in!
