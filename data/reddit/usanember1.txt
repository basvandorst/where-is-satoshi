Is just that I am not sure what they are asking for? They want a bitpay link but I didnt even use bitpay?? :S
I found the "hash" of the transaction and I sent them that, the btc address I sent the bitcoin to is their btc address and I already gave them my btc address as well . I am kinda confused here.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:13:22
But can be reversed, bitcoin transactions can't. No matter if you write a wall of text about it.

I used blockchain .info wallet
Thanks for the link I will check it out
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:12:40
But can be reversed. Bitcoin transactions can't , no matter how much you wanna hide it with your little libertarian ideas kid

The fact that the story and a bunch of threads about the article are in the front page of bitcoin is not surprising at all, honestly most here are americans, who believe in stupid american media that lies everyday about everything (changed the channel and cnn said russia invaded ukraine...lol).
Seriously we need a less american-fat-stupid members in this forum or else we will still be called stupid by the whole world.
The story is bullshit of course (anyone with a decent brain can tell by reading it) , but it is funny that dumb americans like you are here argueing about it hahahaha

I was refering to the guy replying to the OP (who clearly knows what he is talking about vs a random deluded kid who doesn't). And come on, I know it is a generalization to call all bitcoiners kids, but I said "MOST", I feel sorry if you felt offended by it, but I said most not all. (And this is true, just take a look at the top posts , top submissions in this sub) 
Also, I wasn't braging about my education, I was just mentioning it because you called me undereducated, which I am not, at all.  I don't really care about being downvoted or "being taken seriously" , it is hard to make a comment in this sub which isn't pro-bitcoin and get an upvote even if yout argument makes total sense and is 100% right. Or hell, it is hard to even get an educated response.  I think you should re-read what I said in my comment, I made another comment in the meantime and another kid in this sub is calling me a "troll" for an argument I made, however, he didn't provide any counter-argument for what I said, just "troll" and some more insults. Kids will act like kids, and most here are kids, simple as that. Read: most. He already went thru my post history and started replying to every single comment I made with "troll hi , hi troll" and downvoted everything. I mean, it is hilarious and sad and it keeps showing me what this sub is made of. People in this sub lack education, financial education ! They make statements daily which make no sense at all, they delude themselves saying bitcoin will end the fed and the US dollar and other sensless stupid shit , like they don't realize that bitcoin market cap (probably 99% if the people in this sub even know what that is)  is barely 5.5 billion atm, which could be compared to a small company in the US if any...... but whatever, I am out, peace.!

@_date: 2014-05-15 06:25:35
Aaand this kids, is how you get brainwashed. 
Notice that at the end of the video he actually says "cryptocurrencies will...." not "bitcoin will...."  
this is because theer are now many cryptos, bitcoin is overpriced and it will be replaced. I am convinced that cryptos are a revolution to the way we send money , but stop deluding yourself thinking that bitcoin is unique, it is NOT . Bitcoin grew the way it grew because it was unique, but it NO LONGER is unique, so other cryptos are now in the scene and some are wayyyy better than your beloved btc, sooner or later you will have to deal with this fact and then you will realize why bitcoin growth has no longer potential (in price). 
And please dont forget to downvote my comment because it is not positive regarding bitcoin and it insults your religion cult.

Here is what the irs notice means to me: 
Nothing, I am not american and I couldnt care less what they do or dont.
You should include MURICA in the title, the rest of the world doesnt care about this, at all.

@_date: 2014-03-26 14:34:41
lol  here claiming that it is not possible or really hard to do tax evasion, seriously be a little creative and you can buy and sell as much coins as you want without anyone finding out, after all we have stuff like localbitcoins, just to name one example of how you could -with a little imagination- avoid being taxed at all. I feel bad for the americans tho, living in a police state with no privacy must suck , they even took away all your hopes with this announcement, that is just sad people. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:18:59
Thanks for the info. Say I wanted a payment to be confirmed within 10 minutes, how much fee should I pay for this? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 08:04:23


LOL ! Again, you don't understand what intrinsic value is. Go grab a book.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:35:22
The article is a beautiful peace of constructed bullshit. I am 100% that fella didnt create bitcoin. American media is spreading lies as usual, just changed the channel and they said Russia invaded Ukraine, hello? Any smart american out there? 
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:45:34
Huh? So you don't understand what intrinsic value is so I must be a troll because I told a guy who doesn't understand shit about gold that he is wrong, right?  You make me laugh, honestly little boy, you and your cult friends here are hilarious, you dont understand something, then downvote, you disagree with a post, you downvote and you call the OP a troll and yet make no argument whatsoever. Hahahaha, go ahead make me laugh again. Sup with my post history, you saw that I made some other negative comments about bitcoin and you concluded that I am a troll? hahahah keep those comming idiot, you  fit 100% the deluded bitcoiner stereotype.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:27:53


I love how you have no clue what you are talking about and then even dare to compare gold and bitcoin, hahaha fucking idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:49:17

@_date: 2014-03-24 07:03:02
Hey dude, I read again what you said, went thru my browsers history and I found the bitpay invoice which is what I think they are asking for! Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:37:27
and dont forget that by using bitpay you will have to pay a monthly fee, which probably wont even be covered by the sells you do in bitcoin. 
Overall is a bad business to accept bitcoin unless you are some online store with very decent orders per month. You could always use the renting money to pay your bitpay monthly bill.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:33:09
you cant expect 14 year old kids to understand economics, they haven't finished school yet. It is hard for me to see you trying to argue with dumb people in this sub, do 2 more comments that are not positive about bitcoin and you will be labeled "troll". Not even that, but your comments will get downvoted and buried just because you made an argument that isnt moon-like.
I love to see this sort of stuff being in the top of this sub, because it keeps showing me and other decent brained people how dumb the majority of bitcoiners are.
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:49:28
lol are you stalking me now? And I didnt even say that but by now I see that you are some deluded soul who cant understand much about privacy :(
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:11:37
you mad little kid? My statement is true. You guys keep spamming businesses to accept bitcoin but no1 in here wants to spend bitcoins because bitcoins' price crashed and most people in here is at a loss. Again, most people here bought bitcoins at the peak or near the peak, then they kept buying "cheap coins" for $800 $700 , omg guise cheap coinnsss look only $600 for a bitcoin, then $500, and guess what will continue to happen. Look at how much bitcoins are being SPENT, it is a joke, you guys hoarding this crypto and not using it as a currency (like dogecoin for example), so please downvote me and tell me some more 12 year old kid insults like you just did because I insulted your religion.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:18:06
Living outside the US does offer better privacy , damn why would you even argue that , are you really that stupid and desperate that you will just look stupid to defend USA ?
Are you really that mad because I trashed your "Tor and PiA" argument in that other thread that you will stalk me now to try to feel a little better about yourself? Hahaha I´ve met some stupid deluded americans in reddit before, but wow you are something else!
