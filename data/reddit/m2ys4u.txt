Zimbabwe has abandoned its own currency and Iran is approaching hyperinflation. Accepting either wouldn't be "responsible and prudent" either. Nothing in the e-mail says that government backing is their *only* criteria.

No, because Microsoft has not been deprived of anything - they still have their copy of the software, and they still own the monopoly over said software.

"Legal tender" just means that something is a valid payment for debt and has nothing to do with whether or not it's legal to accept as a donation or payment.

Because dictionary definitions and legal definitions are always the same...

Bitcoins aren't "intellectual property" (ugh, I *hate* that term, it's so utterly vague and confusing, probably intentionally so but I digress...), but they are probably *intangible* property.

"*far* left"? lol.

Sure, if one dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.

This is patently false, otherwise one single pirated copy of Office would mean that Microsoft was unable to sell Office to anybody ever again. Furthermore, people who have pirated Office have subsequently bought it, which if your statement was true would be impossible.


Except you don't have the money after you have given it to somebody else...

It's not the act of copying the key that's the theft, it's the act of *spending* the coins that's the theft.
If you spend somebody else's coin (appropriating their property) without their permission (dishonestly) they are unable to spend it themselves (permanently depriving).
The thing that Microsoft actually *owns* is the monopoly to control their software. When somebody unlawfully downloads Office their monopoly has been infringed, but they aren't deprived of the monopoly.

Yeah, I'm following it. Still, Falkvinge did jump the gun...

Falkvinge has been a bit premature...
At the moment (00:19 UTC), 27.8% of the votes have been counted and the Pirates have dropped below the 5% threshold.
We'll have to wait and see...
