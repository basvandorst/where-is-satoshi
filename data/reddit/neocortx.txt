Good ones, though not bitcoin related.

You want to pay taxes? I have a hard time believing what I'm reading. Why not just keep your money to yourself, your family and your friends? At least you don't spend it on wars, right?

While I do agree that it will be hard to convince the users to switch to such a system, and while I think it would be the deathblow to Bitcoin to do so, I don't see the logic in your argument. If we went over to an inflationary system for bitcoin, and the miners generated extra revenue, then this would be beneficial for them at the expense of the rest of the participants in the BTC economy.

Good post
@_date: 2013-02-06 02:38:54
Thanks, that's valuable information. 
In other words their service is basically useless for anyone who are concerned about privacy.
It means that all the funds going through that card is under surveillance, and any government who dislikes that you own Bitcoins can arrest you a few years from now when the economy gets worse.

I tend to agree. And I guarantee that it will drop again. Problem is, I don't know if it's going to drop from 21 and down to 17, or if it's going to drop from 16.5 to 14.

How about moving out of the US? I don't have any problems with MtGox, and I suspect the reason is that I'm not a US citizen...
@_date: 2013-01-21 20:30:02
And most media is bought and paid for... and not in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-06 02:29:30
Thanks, updated.
@_date: 2013-02-06 07:23:37
Yeah, lol. I've looked into darknet. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 03:20:33
Come on mate, study up a bit more before you do this.

What's great about getting gov in on bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-01-21 09:09:32
Is that possible with Bitcoin? I don't think it is. It would mean that you could create bitcoins that don't exist, and then transfer them to other addresses. I think that it's not allowed by the client...
@_date: 2013-02-11 20:23:08
If you use version 0.8.0, it's faster. It's just a release candidate, but it works for me.

Yeah, Bitcoin and tally sticks are almost exactly the same. Only tangible difference is that Bitcoin has no central authority holding them.
@_date: 2013-01-21 19:05:44
Agree. I know this might be redundant, but my tip is to immediately take backup as the FIRST THING when you create a new wallet. First thing you do, before sending any money there.
I had a crash on my computer and all files were lost. Luckily I followed my own advice, and had a backup encrypted on a USB.

Always be cautious. What if Bitcoin becomes illegal? You want that transaction on the record for the rest of your life? How about finding a cash merchant instead, leaving no paper trail?

Got a feeling you're going to have a rude awakening a few years from now. Tell me how it works out for you.
No, wait. I guess I'll be reading it in the news.
@_date: 2013-02-06 02:29:21
Thanks, updated.
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:37:51
Don't worry too much. There's another crash coming. It never goes up in a straight line.
@_date: 2013-02-10 10:05:34
I've tested it, it works.
Faster, I like the new organizing of the files. 
@_date: 2013-01-29 10:19:41
That's funny

The most beautiful and simple Ponzi scheme I've seen to date. No promises, no nothing. Just a simple caste in the sky.

Please get out of Keynes economics. It doesn't work, it's why governments are printing to infinity. Learn some Austrian economics instead, and you'll see that this behavior is very beneficial. Instead of wasting all resources today, we can actually behave responsible when we have a proper monetary system. 
High savings and low spending is EXACTLY what we need to deal with the environmental issues. It's also the road to a prosperous economy. 
This is why I think BTC economy will do fantastic over the long haul (way better than the lousy 1-2% growth government run economies can brag about), because people are making so much money by saving and investing only in good projects.

I've asked the writer for his bitcoin address so I can donate. I want to encourage him to keep writing.
@_date: 2013-01-21 20:39:23
I can't see why it should be considered evil to stand on the side of freedom and prosperity for the human race...
Just because you happen to profit from it perhaps?

TCP/IP won the battle because it was distributed. Are we watching history repeat with Bitcoin? What do you think?
@_date: 2013-02-02 20:19:14
Something like that. It uses a massive 2 GB (almost exactly) to have Armory loaded on an online computer. The developer told me he's looking at doing something about it in the not too distant future. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 06:09:51
Latest transactions are about 4 hours old. 
Well, if Blockchain is permanently down, it just means you have to restore the addresses from your backup. Not a big deal, right?
@_date: 2013-02-09 08:48:55
Anyone who can actually explain what this means? I looked up I2p, so it's got something to do with anonymity. Sounds awesome, but can anyone explain? Are there now 2 bitcoin systems, since it's a fork? What are the miners working on? 
@_date: 2013-01-21 07:00:10
Your question sadly shows how good job the central bankers have done in the battle of ideas. People actually believe that if their money becomes more and more worth over time, that somehow the economy will crash.
If Bitcoin becomes something big, then there will probably be no recession or depression. The only reason that you have depressions is because of the inflation boom before the depression.
Inflation is the problem, and having a depression is the solution.
The austrian school has explained this brilliantly, search for example "Shiff was right" on YouTube. Austrians can predict the business cycle, your college professor (and mine) cannot.
@_date: 2013-01-29 03:22:12
Beautiful work.
@_date: 2013-01-29 03:44:09
What's exceptional is the speed the funds are moved by. Many transactions occur just seconds apart. So this person has a lot of addresses.
@_date: 2013-02-06 03:33:58
Volume last 24 hours is 35 710 BTC, so gox should be able to handle another 100 BTC without you moving the price too much.
Just remember to take a backup before you start moving the money to your wallet. Bad things tend to happen when you least want it.
@_date: 2013-01-29 03:26:07
This is not fair game. You should be more kind to fiat currencies. Don't kick those who are lying down.

I know everyone has a learning curve, but I would suggest reading the terms of the IPO for SD, especially as mentioned 2.2 (a) section b).
Seems you signed that you would not do exactly what you did...
@_date: 2013-02-05 19:59:05




Seems a pretty clear breach of the agreement to me. Something I'm missing? And who owns the PGP signature at the bottom there?
@_date: 2013-02-02 20:25:41
I use Armory mostly. It's got many nice features, like you can have multiple wallets. Nice for someone who cares about privacy. It also allows you to see how many transactions each address has, which is very practical if you want to follow the prudent privacy policy of just using each address once.
@_date: 2013-01-29 20:19:20
Yeah, Vanitygen. They also have a program for doing GPU "mining", normally it goes MUCH faster.
@_date: 2013-02-09 10:09:00
I'd argue you can have one P2P monetary system per planet, and then free exchanges between the planets. That way you would be able to process high-frequency local payments rapidly, while if you were doing a long-distance payment you'd be able to do so through an exchange. This would also help import/export imbalances, just like gold did before Bretton Woods.
@_date: 2013-01-26 20:13:55
What a waste of perfectly good bitcoins that would be. The school system is malfunctioning. 
@_date: 2013-02-11 20:31:02
I suggest trying. I think you'd be surpriced about the actual market depth when you start trading. Small orders like 10 000 USD doesn't move the market much. If you got millions, yes, you'll move the market quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-01-21 20:41:38
I'm sure he has thought of that.
@_date: 2013-01-10 10:01:32
I don't see how "need" is a part of the economy. I doubt buyers of bitcoins care about the needs of the miners...
@_date: 2013-02-05 22:22:36
I'd love to get some user feedback on 
1) The simplicity of using
2) The anonymity
3) Any other opinions you might have on it
@_date: 2013-02-06 07:28:43
Yeah, we all have to be politically correct in a society of invertebrates, right?
Thanks, I've updated it with both your suggestions.

I'm just laughing out loud. What planet are these guys living on?




Again, this is just hilarious. Is it possible to be this misinformed? (hint: yes, but you have to see it to believe it)
@_date: 2013-02-06 05:57:58
Just send me 10% of the money I saved you...
Open %appdata%/bitcoin and copy the file wallet.dat to a USB stick or something. If your computer crashes, you better have a backup of that file, or your bitcoins are lost. It's the file where you keep your private keys. Also take backup for every 100 transaction if you use the Qt client. 
It might also be smart to store the files inside an encrypted container. TrueCrypt has proven itself to work reliable.
@_date: 2013-01-10 10:08:38
I would argue that it's better if BTC for now stays under the radar. Why rush it and risk stupid governments getting too interested before bitcoin has become mountain solid? Use the time before BTC goes up to work more and buy more BTC. If Bitcoin works 5 years from now, it will make us rich anyway.
Patience my friends, no need to rush. Rushing usually means putting too much pressure on the system and worse customer experience.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:35:59
This is the most stupid idea I've heard today.
Why would anyone in their right mind willingly hand over honest Bitcoin to something as corrupt as a government?
Let the government have their own stupid paper money, and keep the good money for yourself.
I'll never use your service E-govLink. It's very ironic though. Government picking up a technology that will destroy them. I love it.
@_date: 2013-01-31 20:11:10
I don't think this entirely reflects the truth.
Your numbers assume that the random generator in the computer actually creates a random number. It's not always like that.
And if the seed of the random number is the same, then the output is the same. Thus, bad random generators might have a high chance of creating collision. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 23:05:48
I'm not going to comment on the tax side of this, but did you use Tor or at least VPN to set up this scanonn identity? If not, you could be traced by your IP address.
You have to be careful man. Enough good people have disappeared already. Governments will hate bitcoiners more and more as they get more and more financial problems.
Please build prudent privacy for yourself.
