Thank you! You have been a great help. As you mentioned before, should I claimed that it was a unauthorized transaction?

Thank you, much appreciated!

Is there anybody who has experience with a similar case like this and actually won a dispute case?
Your kind help would be much appreciated.

ugg, should've known that. in this case, is this disputable in either the exchange or PayPal?

Thank you for your reply. Should've known these... :(

I suppose I should immediately start a dispute? He says to be patient and he will send my BTC, but still not sending a screenshot of payment on hold. I'm pretty sure that looks like another sign of a scam.

Could the seller send a dispute back to that though? Since he has not indicated that the trade is ended. I’m afraid he is going to use the WhatsApp chat log to argue back on that case.

Oops, sorry I didn’t mean to say anything bad about them. Just wanted to explain that I’m new.

Not as bad as your, $200 :(

I’ll see how everything turns out

I have issued the dispute ticket and hope it will work. Again, thank you for everything you did.

Not an American citizen, but lives in the US. I have a server seller who only accepts USDT, and I only have USD in my hands.
