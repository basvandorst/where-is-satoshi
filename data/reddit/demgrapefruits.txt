wait what? coinbase reports transferring coins as a sell? that does make sense

What about existing coins in your gdax account did you have any or just cash?

I have the same issue with around the same amount stuck. What can I do @_date: 2017-05-04 18:37:21
I got a reply an am waiting for my pending transactions to complete to be able to withdraw and also still need next steps to withdraw from gdax.

I mean at this point I'm not concerned about that as much as retrieving the rest of my coins from gdax and getting the orders cleared that r still in progress

I'm dealing with this issue now, suggestions on how to best reach would be appreciated. I've emailed, posted on their subreddit, and reached out on twitter, no response.

How is Gemini? coinbase abruptly closed my account today, I'm not sure for what reason but I'm still trying to get my coins out of GDAX (which they do not provide any means to do when they close your account) but definitely looking for a new exchange now...

Have you been able to properly get your funds extracted from GDAX? Or has no resolution occurred yet?

I read the research report definitely worth the time to read. It’s provides good detail. It’s wild how Mining equipment and hardware have all plummeted so closely with bitcoin price. Their charts and data are great
