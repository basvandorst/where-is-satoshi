In terms of the phone, I recovered the device using find my iPhone. It was stolen for approximately 2.5 weeks. I checked find my iPhone every single day and it finally showed up under the lockers at the gym I work at. Whoever did it must have stolen the money successfully, then put the device back in a hidden spot. There’s no evidence of who did it. It had to of been someone that I work with, or trains at the gym. But unfortunately, there’s no cameras in the locker rooms or in the building all together.

Unfortunately, my phone doesn’t have a password and when you open Coinbase on my phone it goes straight to my account. So it was open season for whoever had my phone.

I’m not sure. Just wondering how/if it is possible to get this money back.

I wanted to post this under the Coinbase sub but I did not have enough karma to post there.

Directly through the app. I never had it set up for PIN or Face ID. Never will make that mistake again.

I think I am going to have to contact a lawyer. Trying to contact Coinbase has been a loophole where I have not been able to speak to anyone on the phone. I just wanted to see what advice people had in this sub.

I was using the app

Appreciate that man. Gives me a good perspective and a life lesson. Only being 25, I’ll live. And it seems like a lot now but I’ll overcome it.
