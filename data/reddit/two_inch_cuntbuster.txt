Don't. This current rise was unforseeable and you probably needed that cash then. I'm still predicting a substantial fall soon, so if that happens you will be able to buy back in.

Posted this in &gt;Damn, I guess that game is up then. Not that I can blame the banks too much here. There definitely are concerns about money-laundering and the way banking is so highly-regulated in the UK means it's hard for money-launderers to operate here.

As far as I know Satoshi hasn't commited any criminal offense and it would be a serious lack of committal for the Satoshi persona to suddenly lapse in carrying out a traceable transaction such as this. Even back in 2008 there were plenty of deniable transaction facilities available to purchase things such as these.

It took a while for me to get out of this thought process, but the variety of different places accepting Bitcoin now make this much more feasible. The price is rising a little bit too fast to make purchases valid but once it settles down again, I won't have any problem is using Bitcoin for all my semi-large purchases.
