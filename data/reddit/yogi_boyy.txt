Haha, it's funny you commented, because I was looking through your profile earlier, being entertained by all the arguments you engage in Reddit, thinking to myself, "Boy, I hope I never end up like this person."

Woah, cool. Thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. I am hoping to understand more of how these people think (in terms of the mental or academic instruments they may be using), so I can become an independent thinker for myself over time.
Edit: I am reading up on her analysis. It's interesting because Bitcoin has been floating around $4,000 and has not risen much past that, which is what she claimed. Interesting to know!

That's a pretty neat graph! It seems to make sense to me, but what do I know.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:35:44
Wise words. History does that back that up.

Thank you!
You're the best. I am watching that video right now. I am feeling hopefully and it's only like 5 minutes into the video lol.

Cool. Is that a sub or user? I could not find anything under that handle when I searched here.

Thanks for explaining it to me. It makes much more sense now. 
If my understanding is correct, then one would expect a large collapse in value?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:27:49
Oh, lol.
God damn it.
I am a serious investor.

Haah yeah, admittedly, I do not =)
I read that earlier today. I definitely do not want to trade. I have read and seen enough to suggest someone​ like myself must HODL. Someone proposed leveraging but I think that is a terrible idea because of the volatility. 
HODL it is.

Come on by to IOTA, friend! No transaction fees here =)

If they must had chosen crypto (understandably, the anonymity seems desirable for crime), I wish they demanded some other coin/token than Bitcoin. It would have probably lessened stigma toward cryptos all together and reduced substance for yellow journalism against cryptos. 
But, I ain't worried-$10,000 is around the corner. 
Edit: I can't imagine the sour down-voters of this comment being holders of Bitcoin haha.

Your hubris and haughtiness on this matter absolutely amazes me. An accurate judgement of someone's financial portfolio or soundness of decisions requires knowing all factors and variables involved; I am willing to bet the farm you know absolutely nothing about it, aside from the image above.
And this made me laugh:


If you do not think cyrptos are purely a gamble, you better change your username.

Is it misogynistic, or is the joke actually on males?
Are you man-shaming someone for being sexually attracted to a particular sex or gender?

Great question!

Yeah, I wish this post could have simply been a therapeutic one for everyone involved. I do not invest in BTC, but I feel for my fellow BTC investors.
