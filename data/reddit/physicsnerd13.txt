The article says:
"Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, merely having possession of the wallet file itself is enough to prevent the coins being spent. The Bureau is in a position equivalent to having seized a safe belonging to a suspect with no idea of the combination – and no hope of forcing it open any other way."
Excuse my ignorance about bitcoin, but can't there be multiple copies of the wallet file?  If so the FBI has not prevented the coins from being spent.

I like that too.

The courts still can force someone to produce items, like a key to a safe or a gun (even if they incriminate you), but the courts have found that passwords (or things stored in your head) are protected.  In this case I think he could take the 5th, but the courts could suggest that he needs to provide bitcoins as evidence which is not something in his head?

You give a valid reason why the term mining could be used; however, more people relate the term mining to the fact that bitcoins are getting harder to find just as precious gems get harder to find in a mine.  People should stop using that analogy.

The feds can't force him to hand over the password, as it is considered self-incrimination and is protected under the fifth amendment.  The supreme court has upheld that interpretation of passwords.  Read:  for more info.

Do the feds know what the public address for the wallet file they have, or is that behind a password as well?  Do we know  (it was posted a few days ago where the feds were storing the other bitcoins that the seized)?

The act of finding a hash that is suitable for the chain is called mining.  And this term works a little since the hash also gets you a chunk of untapped bitcoins, but in the future this will not be the case.  Wouldn't bookkeeping be a better (but less glorifying) term?  The hash is really there so you can add transactions to the chain and that is more of a bookkeeping term.  Once all the bitcoins are mined it will be this bookkeeping fee that keeps the chain going.

Interesting to note, the courts can't compel someone to divulge a thought (like your password or combo to a safe) but they can force you to divulge an item of something (like a key to a safe).  For example they can force someone to produce a physical key (if they can prove you know where it is) but not a password (which is in your head).  
TL;DR, if you want to protect something from being seen by the courts (in the US) then it needs to have a password that is stored in your head, and not a key that is hidden.
