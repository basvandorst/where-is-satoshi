I don't think you get it - The BTC you are making does not come out of thin air. For every 1 BTC you make someone else is losing 1 BTC. So when the whole thing collapses, as I think it inevitably will you might be okay but at the expense of others.

I agree, but I think that unfortunately it is not a problem that is exclusive to crypto.

Not saying Dr Kimoto Chan (Megacoin developer) is or is not Kim Dotcom. But given the current issues surrounding Kim Dotcom's legal position and the questionable legal status of crypto currencies currently - it might not be wise, if it is him, to come forward at this point in time. Just a thought...

Cloudhashing are criminals plain and simple. Their greed is limitless.

Not really. By definition all altcoins are alternatives to 'the coin' Bitcoin.

Unless you specifically want to use core use Electrum or a similar wallet, ready to go in minutes.

The trust document does not specify he can take a loan to prove he is Satoshi...? It is debatable whether either of the two conditions that are specified in the document would make it possible for him to take a loan simply to prove he is Satoshi.

A couple of thoughts:
1 - Maybe Craig Wright was one of the original bitcoin developers but lost his keys / or handed them over to someone else. There was reports he entrusted 1.1 million btc to Dave Kleiman. It sounds like Dave died in fairly unusual circumstances after cutting himself off from the rest of the world - could he have taken the 1.1M btc with him perhaps out of delusion or revenge for Craig not letting him touch them and live in poverty?
If CW lost the ability to really prove he is Satoshi, or at least one of Satoshi, this could be his attempt to claim what he was in fact responsible (or partly responsible) for.
3 - Were is it stated anywhere that the blog post is claiming to be 'proof' Craig is Satoshi? Looks more like he is saying 'I am Satoshi' then finishing the post with some strange crypto tutorial type thing. Purposefully ambiguous?
4 - Maybe Craig is Satoshi but wants to make it so confusing that most people call him a scammer once and for all. Whats a good way to do that and stop people (including the government) thinking he is Satoshi? Lie, provide fake or sketchy information and let social media do the rest. Kind of clever if that is the case - social media may be behaving exactly as he planned.
5 - How do we know Gavin did not use his phone as an access point to download the Electrum wallet? I am amazed how quickly the bitcoin crowd are to judge and execute Gavin based on a couple of blog / social posts. Seems we need a detailed account of events from Gavin.
6 - I also find it hard to understand why CW would not just release a signed message to the public - maybe this relates to point 4.
7 - Maybe CW did not invent bitcoin but knows who did and knows they are dead - so is trying to claim it is him.
Seems this whole episode raises more questions than it provides answers.

Agreed!
