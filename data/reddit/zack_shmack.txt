As someone who works in technology and is blessed enough to have it blend seamlessly in my life, this is the only issue I have with the crypto market: there are still many, many people out there who don’t understand internet basics. Lack of common sense, and the wide potential for human error could be the only thing that renders the decentralization idea obsolete.

I have a debit card, Shift, that is attached to my Coinbase account. I keep spending money on that coinbase account to as a way to try and get the bitcoin name out there a bit when sliding my card, even though it’s not exactly considered a bitcoin transaction. Anyway, my point is Coinbase is safe enough to keep a bit of money on, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you are holding a considerable amount.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:36:03
Yeah, don’t spread false information. $10 initial payment, no fees thereafter unless you withdraw from an ATM. Magnificent card.

Well, to be honest, nothing. Since most of the coins are open-source, replication and attempted thievery (or improvement) of ideas are natural side-effects (and why there are so many “Bitcoin ___” copycats out there already). However, it takes a great dev team, lots of time and effort, and a solid plan for any coin to gain the faith of investors and node operators. The trait that is of particular interest to these important node operators is whether the forked chain will be more profitable to mine or not. If they all choose to switch to the new fork, transactions in the old one will take forever to be confirmed and the distributed ledger will become less secure.
There are numerous open-source programs that are successful forks of their predecessors: Ubuntu, LibreOffice, Firefox, etc. These forks don’t work EXACTLY the way cryptos fork, but the idea is basically the same.
Sorry for the info overload, this industry is getting more complex each second! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:43:05
The smallest amount is called a satoshi. A more reasonable unit of measurement that is being proposed for the new norm call it bits. 100 satoshis = 1 bit. Just like 100 cents = 1 dollar. Another way of thinking of it: 1 bitcoin = 1 million bits.

This has nothing to do with volume. Each candle shows the open, close, high, and low price points for whatever time your chart is set to (1 minute, 1hr, 1day, etc.) This is just a method of speculation as to why the price did what it did during that minute, hour, or day.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:31:57
Why would speed or fees matter if you’re just holding...? The technology will continue to progress and improve. The scaling issue will be fixed in time. Investments are long-term, might as well sell everything and go to the nearest casino if you’re wanting a get rich quick sort of thing. Don’t be part of the BCH problem.

Yes, Coinbase sent an official email to everyone saying thy plan on releasing it to its customers “by Jan 1, 2018.” 
You will get exactly the amount you had in BTC at the time of the fork.
It is technically free money. You are selling it to someone who believes it has value.
Devaluation could occur, but has not happened yet. If the community decides that the forked coin is the better project, more people will back it with their investment, which would have an obvious effect on price since demand would be shrinking.

Man, there are some paranoid people in this thread. Just buy a Nano S and move them. You don’t have to do any more than 2 transactions (small for test, then the rest). I’m not an idiot, but I’m certainly not a genius — but I have never had a single penny’s worth of crypto lost after hundreds and hundreds of significant transactions. I spend more time proof reading my f2a numbers than I do with the wallet. 
What’s the point of holding something you think is going to have value in the future if you’re too scared to use it?
@_date: 2018-05-15 04:06:03
What you just said is a reason there are still so many against bitcoin as a deflationary currency. Deflation encourages saving instead of spending. Don’t feed their argument. It’s still a currency. You’re supposed to use it. If you’re that butthurt about it’s future potential value, then buy the same amount right when you spend it. Using it is what will help its growth, don’t expect everyone else to do the dirty work for you. You think the person who bought pizzas for 10k btc regrets it? No. It was a legitimate transaction that only helped bitcoin.

Luck has nothing to do with it and neither does the amount of money. He obviously saw the potential of the system from researching it like every early investor did and he has been *extremely* vocal about bringing attention to crypto. Doing your research and putting effort into its expansion is not luck. Also, it’s the percentage that he risked that matters, not the amount. Anyone who is worth much less than him putting the same percentage in when he did would still have made an incredible amount of money.

What Samsung *should* do with this is give its users the option to choose whether they want to use the Samsung key storage service or only have the keys on the phone itself. They can clearly display the risks of each and let the user decide.
At this time in the crypto world, there are those of us who are here right now who understand blockchain, and then there are those who don’t (and there are many, many more of them). This phone has the potential to be a massive on-ramp for *them* while educating *them* at the same time.
@_date: 2019-02-23 15:02:45
There is no safe way to store keys. No matter what, there is always a vulnerability. I agree, trusting a company like this to manage them is against the point of crypto. But I can’t help but argue that: people are idiots. The vast majority of people out there *need a lot of assistance with technology*. Some don’t realize that getting a new phone or that resetting it to factory settings or even deleting an app will make them lose their funds since they never bothered to write their keys down ( because “what even are keys anyway?”). The stupidity of the general public regarding tech is ridiculously high.
As of now, that’s a weakness of crypto in terms of mass adoption. It’s stupid, but it’s still a problem.

I used it to hold BTC, ETH, and LTC for about 2 months. There were syncing issues when using different devices which caused a little stress. Another time, all of my balances showed zero for the better part of a day. They still have a lot of bugs to work out, which is a shame because I really, really loved the interface. I left ETH on jaxx, but immediately changed BTC and LTC to Breadwallet and Loafwallet, respectively. Eventually, they all went to a Ledger Nano S, which is just as awesome as everyone says.

[This video]( should help answer your question. It’s a fairly recent upload by a man who lives, eats, and breathes Bitcoin. Basically, he notes that we are still well within the early stages of this technology, much like the internet was when it was starting to get a grip in the real world. There’s a LOT left to fix, but certain in-progress projects will be implemented into the system which will certainly help with this scaling issue.

Cryptos are getting stolen due to human error: people do not protect their private keys. It’s the equivalent of a password to your wallet. As long as that is safe, you are safe. The blockchain doesn’t have anything to do with lost funds, unless someone sent them to the wrong wallet or the aforementioned private key issue occurs.

Your money is not stored on any apps or programs, it is held within the address in the bitcoin system itself. Wallets just allow you to access it with a pretty interface. As long as you wrote down your seed phrase like it told you, you’ll be perfectly fine. In fact, you should be able to use that same seed phrase in any wallet that accepts seeds in that format.

I think a good lesson here for you is realizing that the seed you had to write down does not only work in the BRD wallet. It is basically the password to YOUR personal address on the blockchain, so it can be accessed in any other wallet that allows you to enter a seed.
Also, not understanding a technology does not mean you can go out and publicly shame a company. This is still early in the game, obviously there will be bugs. But immediately assuming your money is stolen is simply illogical and shows your lack of knowledge on the subject. Research before you put any real money down, even if it is just an Olive Garden dinner’s worth.

Apologies! Coinbase is a website/app that is usually used by new users’ for purchasing bitcoin. Their fees are pretty dramatic though, so I would avoid using Coinbase. GDAX and Coinbase are the same company, but there are zero fees if you buy with a limit order on GDAX. However, I believe their verification process requires ID if you are looking for higher limits.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:07:37
A wallet is a place you store your bitcoin for safe keeping. Just like your regular wallet that you Lee your cash and credit cards in, except it is electronic. If you are looking to hold your bitcoin for a long time, make sure you keep it in a wallet and don’t lose the password, or it could be lost forever. If you are looking to try and daytrade, you would probably be alright keeping your bitcoin on GDAX, Coinbase, or Gemini, which are exchanges. These have had security issues in the past, so it is usually recommended to just hold them and watch it grow!

You’re absolutely correct about forming your own opinion though. There are a lot of die hard type of people here who refuse to see positives or negatives in certain cryptos. I personally avoid YouTube like the plague for legitimate crypto information, but many seem to find it helpful. You do you.
Simply from the way you’ve worded your response here, I have a feeling that you won’t have a problem thinking for yourself. I would say the only soft rule is to avoid being the guy who asks “should I sell?” Or “how long do I hodl?” It tends to feel like a meme economy here sometimes, but there are truly fascinating new technological breakthroughs happening every day.

Any wallet is perfectly fine if you have the keys. It’s the exchanges that aren’t the safest to keep your money on (Coinbase/GDAX, Gemini, Bitfinex, etc.). They’re still fairly safe though, but it’s simple and cheap to move it to a wallet.

I’m realistic. The majority of people aren’t as risky as you and I. The majority of people simply don’t see the potential that bitcoin has yet. Adoption is the ultimate goal, of course it’s good. You and I seem to have widely differing levels of patience.

Please god, don’t let r/bitcoin turn into a classifieds subreddit.

I don’t think we are in the same page here. I’m neither for nor against Shift. I have one and use it regularly because it’s the closest thing we have. However, it’s not a true “scan this QR to pay me” bitcoin transaction. It’s not a bitcoin transaction at all. When you use your Shift card, the company you are paying *has no clue you are using bitcoin*. I really don’t know how else to say it. 
You turned a civilized discussion into something just... weird. Bitcoin bank? What? Additionally, consumers today are way, way less than 50% of the transaction. It’s 2018, you should probably update yourself on how businesses function in today’s world. Wal-Mart is going to make their money whether they throw out half of their expired lettuce or not. We matter a lot less than you think. And your Visa Shift card even less.

Because 300,000,000 aren’t using it. Also, again, *Shift card != bitcoin*. It’s fun to bring imaginative theory into play, but in reality that’s not anywhere near how any of this works. Once the population has total confidence in bitcoin’s stability, then your theory comes into play. Until then, if anything, the Shift card only contributes to the volatility, since you are buying and selling so often. Do you totally live off of your Shift card? No. Currently, that is impossible. Not every business accepts Visa (again, *because Shift is not bitcoin*). Your delusional daydream needs to be reigned in a bit.
And lay off the Taco Bell.

When you swipe, your btc is converted to USD (because Coinbase is an exchange), since nobody really accepts btc. Therefore, it really doesn’t do anything new or important to Bitcoin at all. Until the businesses we use daily start accepting btc, Shift (or similar) is the best option we have... *for now*.

Instead of withdrawing (supposedly) useless cash, why not spend all the money in your account on bitcoin? Like... duh?
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:47:47
Well, at least they’re trying...

You exchanged USD for BTC to “load” your Shift card. It simply gets exchanged back the moment you swipe. It basically acts as a volatile USD debit card, where your balance in USD is constantly changing and the amount of BTC stays constant. The places you use the card at only care whether or not you have enough USD to pay for whatever it is you’re buying, since they will receive USD.
For their records, your transaction only shows up as a Visa transaction, so if everybody used a Shift card it would just look like everyone used a Visa card (which they did).
None of the transactions indicated above involve the BTC blockchain whatsoever, just the lone wallet you used to exchange between USD/BTC and back.

Haha I’m not generally one to argue, but I couldn’t resist the bait. I’m definitely going back to being a lurker after this doozie...

FYI, you have the ability to [convert pdf files into Kindle files]( and it’s pretty freaking awesome! I actually use this feature mostly to read whitepapers when I’m interested in new coins.

Oh goodness how fast our complaints change. One mention of it on national news caused great celebration just a year or so ago. Now look.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:37:10
I have a Shift card too and love it, but it’s still a Visa card. While it’s a great start, it is not truly considered a btc transaction, as you’re technically exchanging btc for fiat every time you swipe. However, LN stays true to the bitcoin fundamentals and remains virtually fee-less.

The beauty of a large, fully decentralized currency is that nobody is in control. There can be threats to regulate, or laws may be put in place to forbid its usage, or monitoring of web activity could be attempted, or access to exchanges denied, but fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on what side you’re on) nothing can truly be done about the system itself. You could even be deemed a “criminal” in the eyes of some for using it, but it’s still going to e there, as long as it’s being used.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:49:35
I’m sorry but.... no. This is the reason I stopped talking about crypto to people. It’s starting to come off the same as “CrossFit bros” and “Veganists” do. 
e.g. nobody cares nor wants to hear about it.

Sure, that might be the case for a normal market... but as we all know, the crypto market is anything but normal. It has garnered an incredible amount of attention the past couple of years, I would not be shocked if things moved a lot quicker than you say. But I’d also not be shocked if it lasted even longer.
Either way, HODLing has ruined a lot of peoples’ potential gains. I say don’t be greedy, set goals for yourself, and follow them. Support the projects you believe in and do what you can to better the ecosystem.

Excellent article. It shows that at least some of our lawmakers are paying attention and realize the potential this technology has. The fact that it’s a bipartisan effort is the cherry on top. Thanks for sharing.

It’s a shame to see such talent go to waste...
Jokes aside, your art style is great. But... why go political in such a hostile environment? Sure, it garners attention, but you’re only left with half of a client base.
