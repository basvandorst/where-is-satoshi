probably just an update. They say, they have to "change their bitcoin infrastructure". Unfortunately, the users didn't get any notice in advance. I was just trading when the site went offline. There is no info at their facebook page available.
Might be related to bitfinex?

site is back online. Everything as it used to be.

just had a look at the given address. I'd agree that these txs belong to the bitfinex hack. First tx out of bitfinex was way before the big hack on 2nd of August.

Of course he could use coins from another hack back in 2013. But I doubt he's the Bitfinex hacker. Probably some insane fellow playing with other people and looking for an arena. Sky News played well along in publishing "news" about him. In either case I'd stay away from him.

in addition to your comment I got to admit that favoring decentralisation won't solve the 51% risk at all bc it only adds an economic incentive. thus definitely not a sufficient solution.

great work! Unfortunately, I doubt many users will read through this. most of all the part about German/EU laws is interesting regarding other btc exchanges running on a similar business model like mtgox did. I'm registered at 7 different exchanges and bitcoin.de seems to be the only exchanges which thought through this. they have been working on a direct link to its parent Fidor AG in order to supply a similar trading experience like on other exchanges with fiat directly deposited to a user account. your writing gives a sufficient explanation why this hasn't been done yet.

trying to manipulate the market? nice try! go somewhere else with your FUD.

the 51% trouble is not caused by the central mining pools. the current protocol favors bigger mining pools, ie they are more profitable. in order to strengthen bitcoin the optimum in terms of return on investment regarding the size of a mining pool should be lower then 51% - or maybe even the way round: the contribution of a smaller mining pool should be weighted more compared to a bigger mining pool thus driving decentralisation. these rules need to be hard coded without any way to evade them.

I'd say that's the most trustworthy exchange for now. their service works rather like an escrow service. the buy/sell orders are executed directly between the users of bitcoin.de. this might seem to be a bit uncomfortable, but as far as I'd assess is the only way to operate an exchange without the necessity for a banking licence. BTC-e bitstamp etc actually should need a banking licence but somehow still operate without it. Some interesting reading about the topic:

scam! again and again and again! it's going on for weeks now. disgusting.

the transaction delay allowing to cancel a transaction seems to be a nice idea. although 24h might be too long.

yeah! you're right. kind of a finger print...
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:11:33
I'll vote for that!
