I would say QuadrigaCX is the leading Bitcoin exchange in Canada. Just saying.

Ya many of all listings no longer accept bitcoin in my area too.

Well, I asked cause it said to ask all your bitcoin questions. I think putting your personal info on a bitcoin exchange site is still a little sketchy to some. Sites require a lot of ID along with your debit info as well. I'm sure there are a lot of people who still wouldn't do that.

If I send bitcoin to someone in the Philippines or Pakistan or somewhere in North Africa, how would that person typically change that bitcoin into their local currency?

Ya people acquire shit like families to make them happier. What the fuck kind of statement is that and how does it get up-votes? Sad.

Some online exchanges in Canada allow the use of debit cards to fund their accounts and start buying bitcoin. Is this a good idea? Why would one want to do this? Just convenience?

I would totally edit my local area if I had a easy tool to use. So outdated around here.

I think Black Chip accepts bitcoin but its a regular poker site.

You will stop giving me coins :(

So many silly comments in this thread. Most people in here must not be older than 19. Only kids can say some of the shit I just read.

I've been using the Bitsent machine in my city. I think its a Skyhook. All the other places I called or went to that I found on the net either removed the machine for some reason or said it wasn't working. The girl at the store that had the Bitsent machine said it was not working 1 minute after I successfully and painlessly used it. No one at the stores know anything and just say its broken so they don't have to try to figure out bitcoin themselves. When bitcoin gains popularity I think we will see better support from the stores and the businesses running the machines. So far I'm happy with the one I have been using though. Gonna hunt down some more and try them. I'm in Vancouver so there are a lot to try. A lot have shut down though.

I feel lucky that I can just hit up the ATM for my bitcoin.
