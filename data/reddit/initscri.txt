He's still got a point though. Fees may and could cut through the amount quite quick if the amount is below $0.5 USD i'd say.
However. at the point where someone is only putting $0.5 USD, they would only be experimenting anyways and wouldn't care about the fees as much.

It's more of a balance. They use USD, CAD, and other currency codes in order to define value. If they used PPD (for "PayPal dollars") or something of a sorts, then it might be considered a currency. Instead they set their values as "$500 USD", and as such it is not their own currency.

By that theory if we didn't have ASIC's, the general advancement in technology (better CPUs and GPUs) would cause bitcoin mining to be controlled by the elite.
ASIC's are just advancement within technology anyways.
The point that the people originally started or what you call, "the elite" are somehow going to be able to control the market because of the capital and funding they have earned, is natural/evident within any industry or anything remotely close or defined as an investment.

@_date: 2014-02-09 03:08:58
Does not mean it is completely useless.
Companies are and will be maintaining and creating projects to help with the learning curve for "typical computer users".
Example: Companies like blockchain.info (even though it is an online wallet) already provide a very simple and easy-to-use system. When the user learns more about Bitcoin, and begins to develop an interest for it, it is at that point they take the time to research into cold-storage and better use of Bitcoin.

Didn't Dynadot have a controversial issue with Wikileaks involving lawsuits?
Not a marketing scheme that went bad or was controversial, but nonetheless. Point is every company and corporation isn't always great to every customer because different customers have different opinions.
While you may believe this isn't a "gentlemen's" move, I don't believe calling it not a gentlemen's move has anything to do with the actions of Kraken.
Companies cannot cater to every demand of every customer, and a company can only have one "technical" opinion on an issue itself. I'm sure Kraken (as well as many other companies/corporations) have lost customers to actions and opinions they have portrayed, it is inevitable.

Anyone who would completely shut out Bitcoin (or any other object within Business or the economic world) because ONE person does or does not agree with it, would probably not be one to jump into Bitcoin anyway at this point.
Bitcoin is something where research should be involved. Someone who takes one person's opinion (no matter how popular/unpopular that person may be) about something would easily be dismayed within 5 minutes after beginning to participate within/use Bitcoin.

I must apologize for calling them online wallets. Really shouldn't be going on Reddit at 5 in the AM.
But yes, I agree. I think a gateway is a great way to describe Coinbase, with the wallet being a feature which was necessary within their services. An offline wallet is always the best choice.
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:49:14
Coinbase has been great to the community, and they are a great and registered company. However, there can be 2 different flaws with Coinbase that are natural by them being an online wallet.
1. They are online, and have a front-webfacing interface. This will cause an increase of attacks and ultimately might increase your chances of being robbed.
2. Bitcoin is about decentralization. Using an Online Wallet is basically giving control to a third party which you "trust". They also have the chance to rob you, and this must be understood no matter how trusted the company/organization is. Online wallets are the opposite of decentralizations, which is Bitcoin's core.
Many online wallets have been hacked, so there may also be that defaulted untrust within the community, which is rightfully so.

Can you please link the app then. I don't know of any services/apps that will transfer Bitcoin while not transferring to USD without taking a service fee.
The reason I say without taking a service fee is because that would be required for you to use it instead of Coinbase or Bitpay and just turning their deposits off. I would use Coinbase or Bitpay even if I saved on a 0.5% fee because Coinbase and Bitpay are well known and may have a bit more brand and marketing power behind them.

@_date: 2013-12-29 21:19:33
Yes. However, Bitcoin is also powered/funded by legitimate corporations and businesses. Even though a ban is highly unlikely at this point (removing jobs), if it did happen, businesses you know based in those countries (Such as Coinbase or Bitpay in the US) would be forced to desist.
I don't doubt that Bitcoin would still run. However, you would see powerful people within the Bitcoin community leave the community entirely if Bitcoin was made COMPLETELY illegal.
However and like-said I don't believe this would happen. Bitcoin is creating jobs, and would cost a lot for the government to remove something loved by people who actually understand it. The only basis or population they could use to make Bitcoin illegal would be those who don't understand it and think it is causing harm; which as well continue further, that number of people will go less and less.

I used "our" in the form of representing Bitcoin Enthusiasts as a whole; the body you are essentially attacking/bashing. I apologize for not watching every word I type on Reddit. I understand this is a place of professionalism, and as such I apologize.
Sarcasm aside. I am not stating your not allowed to be here; nor am I stating that I have the power to dismiss you in any way.
You can state your opinion about Bitcoin and that you do not find it interesting or that you simply do not like it. However, calling "my" logic "Broken Logic", and proposing that I, "myself" am delusional, can be considered non-constructive and not required by not only myself.
However, just as this is a public forum for you. It is also a public forum for myself (and others).
I, more or less, consider forums to be about open discussion. However, my point in this conversation is that someone normally does not join a forum about a topic if they have no interest in the topic and preferably like to hate the subject of the topic. As such, my response is permitted as well.
Your hostile attention-seeking mannerism is something of which I (as in Myself), do not care to partake in any longer.

Android... I think they are trying to tell us something...
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:00:38
These are my opinions, and shall be treated as such...
Bitcoin as it is now seems to be a lot more than just a "very big experiment". Bitcoin currently has an 8.5 Billion market cap.
However, Bitcoin is peer to peer. Satoshi Nakamoto, even if he did come back, would have a very hard time (if not impossible time) "disabling" Bitcoin. Correct me if I am wrong as well, or have the wrong idealism, but Bitcoin to me seems as something you start, and it runs on its own (with development requirements/updates OFC). It can't really be stopped by one individual person. It's peer to peer and open source, and as such the software has been downloaded millions of times. For example, if the repo was deleted, it doesn't stop someone else from maintaining a fork of the project itself. 
EDIT: This related to buying bitcoin itself, skip (I did not read title clearly)... You can insert questioning here about governments being able to essentially purchase or hold the majority of Bitcoins. However, personally, I do not see this happening. While there comes political effects (which I will not mention). However, what I will mention is that if a government actually went and purchase a huge amount of Bitcoins, it would mean that the government itself, believes on even an institutional level, that there is a currency that could be better than their own, and is risking tax-payers money to essentially put BTC off track.
So to answer your question (or opinion basis), I don't believe this is just a "beta test". This IS internet based financial transactions, brought to you by the minds and is the brain child of not only Satoshi, but many others who have contributed to the project itself.
On the basis of using the Bitcoin Technology itself, the purpose of bitcoin is decentralization. They can use the technology but I doubt it would prosper in competition with Bitcoin. This government currency may have greater control over volatility and security options. However, at that sense, it's also greater control, something that many people in the cryptocurrency industry to be against.

I agree. I wouldn't go handing cryptos to people who aren't interested because IMO it would be a waste of money.

There is a few people in my family who MIGHT have used it on Gyft or something. Only one person in my "family" (sister's boyfriend), would have actually used it because he's interested in it... Guess who got Bitcoins.

Exactly! I've learned more from Bitcoin than I ever expected. The knowledge I've actually learned from Bitcoin more than if not equates the knowledge I would have received from any postsecondary or institutional level education system.
IMO, Bitcoin isn't JUST about the currency itself. It's about something much more. Bitcoin promotes freedom and liberty. Not only if it's goes a bust do we have knowledge from Bitcoin, but we also have a new standard set by those with such beliefs.

When you write an essay, no matter the form of education or grade level, it is, and should be, your decision as to what you write about.
The issue with being an English teacher is that there, in most cases, is always going to be a bias. When you are not an English teacher, you can look at an article, and if you 1. Do not understand it, 2. Don't have the time to read it 3. Think it is inappropriate by your standards: you can simply dismiss the article and go on with your day; without the article being censored for other individuals. Teachers are forced to read these articles which they may not comprehend, and are not allowed to simply "skip" the article. This, in itself, can cause bias. However, the difference between a good teacher and a bad teacher (or one which has no understanding of this concept) is that when they do not understand an article, they either 1. correct the article in a non-subjective grammar-based manner, or they 2. even better contact another teacher who may have a better understanding who can grade the article, or provide feedback as to how it should be graded.
In this situation, I am suspecting the teacher did none of these. Instead, the teacher took a subjective and biased manner.
Even though this is grade 8, teaching is still a profession, and should be taken in a professional manner; which this teacher did not.
TL;DR: If it's an English and the teacher does not understand or want to understand the articles or essays contents, then they should still mark it non-subjectively, or pass it onto another teacher to do so for them.

So I'm guessing you just completely knocked off a few provinces, including Alberta... You do know Cavirtex is based in Calgary, right?

 "It is quite certain that in seeing the people who treat us so well despite their own misfortune, we are more obliged than ever to work hard for their happiness".
Might want to change that, too open for interpretation.

True. Question rephrased... "Sometimes I wish people would choose the smaller pools".
Smaller pools usually have lower fees and as long as they have someone running them that has proven to the community that they are not a scam member, then the pool itself is perfectly fine. Even medium would be fine, but everyone seems to go to the largest ones because they are the most popular thinking they will make the most at those pools...

So basically like a Popup Shop (can be permanent) but with Bitcoin instead.
For example, this was one in Toronto by eBay Canada.

what happens if I upvote?

Awesome! If you do, I'll probably end up purchasing Pro that day and I'm sure others would join in as well.

According to this  it is different for non-apple apps.
Through my research I haven't found a update permitting more than 4 without truncation. Correct me if I am wrong.
Even if it was more than 4; the badge isn't infinite though, eventually it will be truncated (obviously this depends on Bitcoin's Success though).

Evidence probably wouldn't be able to be provided under NDA, or there is no evidence.

I see. I confused WOT with a sort-of "DNS records removed upon enough negatives".
Just to clarify... Basically WOT would be more-or-less a way for individuals to have a sort-of "warning" presented upon requesting a website IF there have been flags from the general WOT public or from individuals they trust. People who are trusted more have more weight than those who are giving bad or fake reviews and are naturally "untrusted" or not trusted.
Thank you for the correction though, I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:49:28
I bet. I'm sure it would be a hit with all the media buzz about both Bitcoin and the silkroad.
I just hope they don't portray Bitcoin as a necessarily super evil, dark and shady currency; because from my experience people will believe anything and everything, even from movies.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:52:50
Likewise. Sorry for calling you out by the way, just thought it was awesome to see.
How long have you been in interested in Bitcoin (even if you just dabble)?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:16:50
I see no reason why it wouldn't be, they are based in Canada (Toronto, ON).
I don't work for Coinkite by the way, I'm just making a observation.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:17:42
At least he admitted it; unlike most Bitcoin opposers I meet IRL.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:16:01
Then why are you here? Don't you have something "better" to deal with... Like fiat?
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:43:28
I can vouch. However, be prepared to lose quite a lot in fees considering Generic fees, and the actual process of converting USD/EUR to Linden Dollars and then to BTC causing quite a bit of fees as well.

Gyft offers BTC payments on their website, see 
Even though there is no reference to Bitcoin through Gyft on the Ellen Show, the marketing for Gyft is great because they reference Bitcoin on their own website, something that will be viewed a lot more because of this.
Humans are naturally (by nature) curious, and as such this is still exposure for Bitcoin because some may view the Bitcoin logo on their website (and I'm assuming app) and may do some research on their own.

What is this commercial going to link to? Or is it just going to be a simple informational video/commercial.
If it's going link to something, I'm a web developer and could throw something together.
Other option could be to just link it to  (If we want to link it to something ofc).
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:26:11
Hadn't seen the video until now. Definitely a funny guy.
Glad to see he earned that much.

Absolutely amazing that you, +are doing this. I'm fortunate enough to not "need" anything this Christmas. I'm only posting here to tell you what an amazing deed you are doing and what a tremendous miracle and help you are providing to those in need this Holiday season. Not only are you representing the Bitcoin community in a positive and amazing way, but you are creating smiles that will last a long time this Holiday season.
Bless you and Merry "Bitcoin" to yourself.

"Bitmit is shutting down on 2013 December 20th. Update 20th Dec: We will let the site some more days online because some users still need access! Please complete your orders and withdraw your funds asap!" SRC: 
Might be a good idea to take the link to Bitmit (under "As a Currency") off your website.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:23:11
Yes, but then wouldn't the web of trust system be centralized; at-least if it held any sort of integrity. Otherwise negative "reviews" could be used against a certain website for it to be taken down much more easily than in a centralized WOT. Correct me if I am wrong.

From r/AMA:
Celebrity requests now banned.
A celebrity request is a request for any single person, or a person in a group of fewer than 20. NOTE: Celebrities are still welcomed to post here, people just cannot request for them to do so.

Thank god he didn't add one more "RAWR" in there; otherwise I would have to too.

Apparently he needed some help with his article.

It could be changed programmatically with IF statements of being above (&gt;=) 1000; and then just firing the change if it is above (&gt;=).
Could be confusing however for anyone just downloading the app or who do not know the difference between mBTC and BTC off by heart (I mean everyone should, but we can't assume everyone will).
It's not that all of these methods wouldn't work; but the fact they HAVE to be used is still a fundamental flaw within the app itself.

I'm a little hesitant to agree with you on this one. I tend not to link Pet rocks or things of which really hold no value and is so easy to obtain to something of which value is based off the premise of demand; demand being lower or higher due to the humorous nature of Dogecoin.
However, I'm not here to glorify Dogecoin. In fact, I'm not doing that at all.
All I am saying is that if someone is able to create and market something, even something as humorous and unserious as Dogecoin, and actually have mediocre success; it just goes to show how the Internet really does allow for innovation and is meant for openness; as well as the fact the marketers of Dogecoin can definitely glorify their own feats of being able to market something that can be so easily targeted by joking and based off literally no seriousness.
