The really is that BTC is limitless for micropayments because of the high fees. For example if you wanna send $50 worth of BTC to someone else and you have to pay $5 fee for that one transaction that's 10% you have to be crazy to do it.
Not the same with BCH since for the same transaction your fee most likely will be 1-2 penny.
Also the block size is 1mb for BTC and I believe is 8mb for BCH.

I know but I didn't mention that POS will be sustainable as well..
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:57:40
All I can say is that if the price of Btc does not confirm after the halving everything can collapse like a sand castle because a lot of miners will shut down they're farms ...will be very risky to keep the operation running without profitability.
I'm very skeptical about the future... POW is not sustainable looking forward... it's an old protocol.
In the end I think  new tech will have last word....investors will follow the future to a new superior digital asset.
This is not Fud just my opinion so feel free to downgrade me if you wish.

Never...no one will pay 100k for 1 BTC.
There are better ways to invest 100k and get better returns.
When you choose to invest 100k you go the safe route without market manipulation and high volatility.

Riple was just an example mate...he even mentioned...it could be Cardano or Eos or any other POS  coin.
Bottom line is that POW coins are not the future.

Funny how you guys think best time to buy is now or yesterday...watch this and judge for yourself if there's anymore a best time to buy.

What dip...this ain't the dip...!!!

In 10 years BTC is not going to be relevant bc of the new technology that is coming... decentralized mining straight from your phone and so on.
Look at this project called Pi Network or XYO Network.
Markets speculation was always based on new coming technology.
Example Amazon, Tesla, BTC.

Not really...if you look from the perspective that 1k or10k is not a  life changer for someone....but 100k or 1mil could have a big impact on someone life.... it's a different ball game.
I'll bet you'll consider different safe options before you'll make that investment.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:05:47
Very true but different dynamics....they invest 100k but they got more BTC quantity for they're investment.
The question is will you invest 100k for 1 BTC or you'll consider different routes for the same money?

I love how you encourage people to take your word that 25% is not a crash. Of course it crashed 25% in less than 24h...Whales pull profits on holders money.
This is all manipulation....tell people to hodl and in a long run they'll make money, buy more if price go down.
Can't you guys see the game....hodl and buy more = long run when the whales sell and take out big profits = short time.
Hodlers maybe will make a 20%/year while the whales....well you figure....big big mulla.

You know this statement with internet was not perfect in 1999 doesn't apply anymore  for BTC.
First of all I own BTC but the true is that BTC is 10 years old tech with no improvements where other coins today have a better tech in terms of scalability and security.
Is just a matter of time people will see this.

My Man,
Keep fooling yourself that BTC will reach 100k or 1 mil.
I'm all aware of how market cap works.
All I'm saying is that the market is very manipulated right now and volatility high.
If I decide to invest 10 mil for example I will pick a different asset more safe.
The way I see it's all a gamble.
My rule is that you can go aggressive and invest in BTC for a small investment like 1-10k and you might hit the jackpot or you go safe for a big investment like 100k-1mil and pick a safer asset for a smaller return.
How would you do it?
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:08:02
The way I see BTC right now is only good as store of value.
Forget about using it as a form of micropayments to buy stuff with it because of the high high high network fees.
I'll give you this example.... let's say you wanna send $50 worth of BTC to someone else and you realize that you are paying $5-6 just in fees.... that's like over 10% in fees... you'll be crazy to do it right.
So you're limited doing any kind of micropayments.
I prefer Bitcoin Cash for that since is more scalable and transaction fees are very very very low... For the same transaction you'll probably pay fraction of a penny.
In the future I think people will look to those differences between the two.

You can call it whatever you want but you can't ignore the fact that they're growth Network in couple weeks reached more than 35k users.
If you can see it I don't have the time to educate you.

Lool...tough guy detected.
Maybe your feast can adjust your  head when you're going to realize how much money you lost in fees...
Do a simple Google search for Bitcoin transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:21:12
I like them both by the way.
BTC for store of value and BCH for payments... they're both great.

This is the Pi Network app project.
Actually one of the best projects in crypto space.
Pi Network the first crypto currency you can mine it straight from your phone. Halving is based on the growth of the network and not based on how many  blocks were mined.
Very interesting project.
