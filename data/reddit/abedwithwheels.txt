honestly, even if it turns out that they've correctly identified the dude, the article is written so poorly, and with so many unaddressed gaps, that it's hard to take seriously.

facepalm for linking my real goddamn name to bitcoin?

that's reasonable. without really knowing anything about the early days of bitcoin, though, i'd defend the assumption based on the fact that people who are extremely distrustful of central banks--and especially those who spend years developing a workaround--tend to be on the paranoid side.

tip for journalists: you're supposed to do this before you publish.

the entire piece stinks with the melodramatic tone of a credulous jackass who really wants to believe that he's solved an important mystery.  you know, without confronting hilariously massive gaps like why this secrecy-obsessed haxor thought that his given name would be an awesome alias.
bottom line--not making shit up, but being way too ready to gloss over crazy gaps with nonsense.

i have no dog in this fight--think bitcoin is basically a gimmick and have no doubt that the creator or creators is/are likely to be a lot like this guy. and i'm not bothered by the idea of 'outing' a dude who's created a multi-billion-dollar enterprise.
but the ridiculous gaps in the published story (dude was highly secretive--but couldn't be bothered to come up with a proper alias) scream editorial laziness.  a lot of the controversy here could and should have been addressed in the original piece.
