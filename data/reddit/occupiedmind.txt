It seems the site may be legit, but he just takes way longer than promised to deliver. Here's to hoping I'm not out my btc. 
I really like the idea of buying games for btc, but I really doubt I'll use this steambits.com again if the service is this terrible. Absolutely no communication from them.

That would be awesome. Though, the moment a reliable btc/steam site gets off the ground, would be the time that steam starts accepting btcs. It would suck to put so much work into it just to have it be obsolete a few months down the line.

I've been waiting nearly a week to receive my purchase from this site, with absolutely no communication from them. Buyer beware.

I wish you would have been able to keep it going as well, sounds like you knew what you were doing. 
I wouldn't mind if he communicated and let us know about issues, but flat out ignoring us and keeping our btc is super unethical.

Still have not heard anything about my purchase. This is getting really frustrating.

Whenever I try to use Gyft on iOS I do not get an option to pay with btc. It just immediately asks for credit card number. Am I doing it wrong?

Still nothing. This is absurd.

I got the code today. Not happy with the service, just glad this is over.

They apparently don't check that email.

I think it's safe to say I will not be getting the product I bought from Ryan Connors (Morphanite). DO NOT BUY FROM STEAMBITS.COM

Alright thanks, that eases my mind a little bit. It sucks that they take a while because I originally planned to make most of my game purchases through them.

Yep, I regularly buy humble bundles with btc. Ill give those other sites a look.

I got the code today. Not happy at all with the service, just glad this is over.

Sure thing.
