What the actual fuck is going on, massive walls just put up on gdax at around 7500 mark... this is fucking retarded. theres some big manipulators out there trying to crash the market to fucking 20x there profits all over again. This is making the BTC market look like trash to experienced investors outside of crypto im sure. How sad this is. I wish i'd had sold allot more at the top...

It wasn't that hard early on. i got lucky being on polo during the initial alt boom and had been watching alts since November last year but hadn't been buying any very regretfully.. Otherwise i'd have multiple millions just from about 10 grand.. anyone thats watch coins like ripple n such with there 50x increases which were common place a few months ago.. i very much hope those times come around again to. Since now i have allot more capital i can turn it into my retirement.. But trading with larger amounts I'm realising comes with allot more stress and it was stressful trading up from .5 BTC at the start which is what i had and it paid $500 (this is where things make more sense for people, when i bought my BTC it was still like $900 US per coin) for it in around december last year. Turned that into 1.5 BTC and that was enough to widen to 3 coins at the time trading daily for about 8 hours. 
Its a job to me now. You have to put in that many hours. But id prefer to grind on my computer than deal with a proper job, and this one has a possibility of early retirement at 32 which is my main goal.

I really need some karma on this site, 15 of it. No idea how to get it... to post in the cryptocurrency subreddit to ask for advice on how to get my enigma tokens. the staff is ignoring me and i paid a half BTC into that stupid ICO and they haven't sent me a single coin. and won't reply to 10 emails now.. so I'm really stuck and need this karma crap to navigate reddit to find the right advice.

Its actually insane how much it's effecting the market.. all you people saying saying 'thank you' now its gone.. i think you'll be regretting those words.. this has nothing but bad implications for future gains in crypto.. Hell.. its even strongly effecting BTC. Who knew a chat box held that much sway... 
I have a feeling Polo will bring it back.. they are going to lose a ton of revenue from less trades. There's allot less incentive to use the site, if volume falls off then its game over for Polo.
I for one say, BRING BACK THE BOX. It induces movement that otherwise we done get. And i for one was enjoying my stable 2-5k a day without any effort.

I reneg on my previous post. Taking away the troll box has brought a stability to trading on polo. Market doesnt get so panic induced i guess.
