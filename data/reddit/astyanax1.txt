I can't get enough of this one
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:14:35
Or 4) invest and get very lucky
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:10:55
Are the BTC fees as bad as the beer prices?  :)
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:38:17
Probably the same as 99.9999% of btc hodlers.  Not a bloody thing
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:30:39
Is this...  Is this a joke?  Please tell me it is?
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:42:18
Dito... Dito
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:14:06
This, as it is if it hits 3K I'm gonna be really hard pressed to not buy; unless that happens within the next couple days
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:30:50
Mars moons!!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:50:01
Sure buddy.
I doubt very much were thinking the same thing if I said anything about big O to you
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:44:29
Bro..  next thing you're gonna tell me you don't know about CarVert
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:15:11
Epicly said
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:45:25
I do actually have a BSc in computer science, but I know little of the actual tech.  Complexities, comp architecture, that sort of stuff is what I do know
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:54:17
Not if the price keeps dropping you won't..  no one can afford it after losing their entire savings (which I can only assume is everyone except me;))
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:35:40
Not entirely sure how that sad story is supposed to make us feel better lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:43:15
It's all luck anyway
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:33:20
Also, this community doesn't have every Bitcoin hodler out there in it
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:54:16
Not if you can't explain the big oh complexities with examples, like most corporate settings with software engineers.
You should post it, u may get lucky
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:44:24
Hitbtc and McAfee, those two are perfect for each other
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:45:06
A lot of the ATMs screw with the price too, make sure they ain't double dipping
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:52:18
So is being married and successful, something that you'll never understand.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:06:13
You sure it's not Chinese New year?
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:48:32
It's almost like despite what he believes, no one really knows what's going to happen.  Anyone that does, put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:50:30
If you really think that, you're a serious moron
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:14:02
Do you know what tails is?
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:43:23
Happy Festivus bro
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:49:22
Yeah, and I think he used it correctly :(  
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:26:15
Man, I'd rather trust fox news than RT, and as a liberal Canadian, I hate fox news
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:39:45
Haha cool
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:41:41
Sane, rational.  Thanks
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:45:37
I don't get it?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:25:04
Very few people give a crap, and anyone who's ok with losing most of an investment for the technology is a moron
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:09:49
Wtf?  Negative price levels?
Who the hell upvotes this garbage lol
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:54:10
I'll hedge my bets by putting 10 whole American dollars down for 2 bitcoins, and leave it for my kid.  Either be a wasted money for a lunch, or really regret not spending 2 lunches on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:34:45
Tails gives a cold storage BTC wallet option.  No information.
I mean, if you're talking about killing people they can likely spend massive amounts of resources to try and find you (apparently if they host an end node, they can try to backtrack all the Tor IPs and maybe get you)
Unless you're an assassin, a terrorist, or the most popular darknet fentanyl dealer, you likely have very little to worry about
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:47:30
you realize in the .com bubble, companies like ebay and amazon survived?  if we have a couple of coins make it through this, one of them should at least be btc
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:28:45
If anyone is stressed about losing their money (whether they can or can't afford it), they over invested?
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:53:58
I agree with your first paragraph, but there's a lot of people that sure had it pay some serious dividends.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:40:00
When it started to tank to 10K and everyone was screaming sell, buying at that point wouldn't have been very smart...  You'd be down over 50%
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:35:33
I was hoping, but very little surprises me in the crypto world now
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:29:14
I'm ok with that, but why are the shitcoins bringing BTC down with it???
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:16:08
People using tails are likely fine too I'd guess?  
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:30:39
Maybe 98%?  Lol
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:27:20
WTF is BTC doing?!?!!!!??!
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:38:37
McAfee has got to be the biggest joke ever.  I'm embarrassed I used to trust his name for virus protection
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:53:05
Hindsight is always 20/20, of course now it's easy to say it was never worth 200 billion dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:56:22
Of course.  Same thing with 5K and other milestones
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:47:16
Correct, but one that's insane about privacy.  Hell after a reboot any virus you intentionally installed would be gone
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:23:33
Gold.  BTC is way too risky beyond 10 minutes
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:52:00
People aren't using it as currency?  Incorrect.  The darkweb uses it for some weird reason, it makes a lot more sense to use Monero or something but irregardless;  Lots of people are using it for currency.
That's not to say its not unstable, it is, and god knows how low it really will go -- or if something big happens and causes it to skyrocket.  IDK.
The S&amp;P500 was down a considerable amount in 2009 for a while; not saying thats the case here, but it sure would be nice lol
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:02:56
Yes they were
