I reached out to people i thought could help me with my investment. someone sending you a link online is NOT telling you how to mix, and i wouldnt even attempt to do that because it seems way to complicated to even fathom.
i was looking to cut my stress on this whole bitcoin adventure and clean my conscience on where my coin came from at the same time. if people believe i am a scammer, then that is completely their choice; however my intentions were just and i would have stayed true to my word.
however when you are already going to be out of 0.6 per coin. you dont want to risk even more by giving it to someone openly.
I stand by everything i said in there. glad i used a throwaway now.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:28:11
i'm also trying to ensure that i dont get my own coin sent back to me, as that would ruin the whole point.
furthermore. what is wrong with the half way house i mentioned
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:24:47
thats the risk i'd take. and it wouldnt really matter to you what i did with them after the transaction would it?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:07:54
I would if i knew how. and at the price i bought them off a friend for, i can more than afford to pay someone to take them off my hands and "mix them" themselves
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:48:45
incentive does not equal intent. i would send you 10 bitcoin and you would walk away $10,000 richer. with my coin, cashed in.
the way i have proposed works for us BOTH equally. as we exchange credentials at the same time. there is no cheat, as you could cancel any transactions from the accounts you gave if someone tried to scam by just making a double transaction

feel free to try it with me now :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:08:51
id rather not have it traced to "me".
this is a TOR throwaway, and the coin i have only logged in on to on TOR via blockchain.
buy them off me if you are so sure?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:18:00
id take that chance. i wouldnt however hold anything like that longer than necessary
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:59:51
what is mixing?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:06:36
here, if you can tell that then wow!
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:23:01
and by me walking away, i lose further custom. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:46:35
not really. he just said what it is. plus a wiki doesnt really show me if it is fail safe.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:30:58
it was, but why should he be allowed to profit if he isnt even going to continue with our aggreed transaction.
either way. he got infinity/1 now, as i got bugger all back
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:18:21
being sarcastic and posting "warnings" about someone trying to exchange his currency isnt really the way to go about it though, is it
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:29:09
I'm going to say this last thing.
I was 100% telling the truth, so much so that i was approached by someone using this thread who wanted to then do the same deal. with the username seen as he had enough karma i was ok with the concept that he was ok to trade with. we agreed that i would send 0.13 btc, he would send 0.25btc, then i would send a further 0.67btc and he would repeat his 0.25. making it a 0.5 to 0.8 growth for him... after conversing enough and [talking on im]( we agreed and i sent my half of the cash. he has since kindly fucked off.
the transcation of me, the "scammer" getting scammed is 


@_date: 2014-01-07 21:22:58
just because i dont want to do something that seems ridiculously complicated, not failproof and time consuming doesnt make me "fishy"
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:32:24
that would be entrapment, and is illegal and cannot be used in court. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:37:11
then it would not make any difference for you to withdraw and put it in a blockchain wallet, then trade with me
