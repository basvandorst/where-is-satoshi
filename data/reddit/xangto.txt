Hah, yeah I missed that!
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:40:58
haha damn you are right! Andreas always deserves a shout out!

Good Job! I think the presentation was fine ����

There is detailed literature on it. I can’t remember if I read it from the book digital gold by Nathaniel Popper (good read for anyone who wants some background on the people in the space) but he had a lock timer of about 10 secs and the agents plugged in a jiggler that would move the mouse constantly so it would not sleep.

Is 12/24 word backups not possible to implement with copay or multi-sig in general? Also great job. So far the experience I have had so far with copay is like being in the multi-sig promised land.
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:41:10
the funny thing is he could share a piece of bitcoin with every single one and still have 90 million satoshis left,
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:24:54
hahaha same!!

That's what I was thinking but I'm not in the mood to get gox'd to be honest.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:59:45
Just downloaded it on every single one of my devices and it works so well! I have to say it feels great to use multi-sig this easily. Thanks Bitpay great job!
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:32:33
Thank you this was a good answer! 
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:22:28

You are indeed right good sir!
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:00:15
If your Trezor is lost/damaged the most secure way to restore your backup is through another Trezor. As you can see from the other comments it is certainly not the only way, but it ensures that extra security. The reason I bought 3 more is they have a discounted bundle on the 3 pack. So I will keep 1 my original and 1 new one and the other 2 will make excellent gifts at Christmas.
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:28:38
Thank God for that!

What if some one does not "solve the magical algorithm/code/math equation thing" who gets the block? What is it exactly? I always seem to stumble at this point when trying to explain.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:04:12
I think this was the problem at the time I tried to read it.
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:26:07
This is so beautiful.
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:59:19
Are there any plans for Trezor version 2 in the near future?

@_date: 2014-12-19 10:31:31
What he said!
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:08:02
To be honest I'm quite comfortable keeping everyday spending money on my phones wallet and every two days or so topping it from the "bank vault" that is my Trezor.
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:26:13
Your comment history just makes me laugh. Useless troll!
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:18:29
To be honest this might be the answer to my worries. If the seed was encrypted I could use Shamir's secret on the password. And hand each family member a fragment of the password and the full seed. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:38:05
I agree. It is one of the most intriguing aspects of bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:40:02
Why would it increase the risk of him being identified may I ask?
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:03:00
As someone from Ghana I will say this: 
1)The way technology is advancing we will see more and more smart phones become available at far lower prices.
2)In Ghana and many other countries in our continent 3G and even now 4G is the norm. We have been able to skip the almost archaic infrastructure, that is cable and broadband. Many people just install 4G wifi boxes in their homes because it just works much better in Ghana. So internet connectivity is not really as big an issue as one may first have thought.
3)Mobile phones are an essential part of the lives of Ghanaians and many other Africans at all income levels. I recently read an article that said the percentage of people in Algeria that had mobile phones was in the high 90s. 
4) Also what you have to understand is that we have 4,000,000,000 unbanked people. Not all of the are "poor african villagers" in Ghana having two phones is certainly not unheard of.
5) For those who are poor at todays price they would be earning more or less 1/300th of a bitcoin a day which is not very much and thus will require less paranoid security. However for mass adoption to happen bitcoin fees will have to reduce. 6 cents is not much in the west however if you are living on a $1 a day... you can do the maths.
6) The reason bitcoin blows mobile money out of the water is, if these huge and often monopolistic companies such as Safaricom's mPesa disappears/goes bankrupt tomorrow you virtual tokens are gone. Next bitcoin opens up the opportunity to do cross-platfrom transactions (You can only use mobile money to and from mobiles on the same network) as well as transactions to different neighbouring nations e.g. If you take a day trip to Togo your money would not be worthless when you arrived as it would be with Mobile money.

Thank you so much I feel like crying!!!
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:29:05
The title really should read "I am trying to increase security on a large amount of Bitcoins."

Would you recommend any tutorials for building such a computer? Because I travel a lot it would have to be a laptop.

:Using Pass-guardian on my offline laptop that is running Lubuntu and has not been online since I formatted it. Then putting the shares into separate documents and then onto separate USBs/SD cards. On each usb will be a document explaining how to regenerate the seed using the shares and the regenerate the wallet. 
I want to print them but I'm not sure how to securely. Please point out any holes you see in the security.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:30:04
I am trying to increase security but at the mean time ensure my family can access them in the most extreme of situations
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:23:53
I meant photocopy without the words lol, should have been clearer
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:34:49
Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I think I will just keep using Coinbase as they have my bank details already. It will take a bit longer with their $3000 daily limit but I might get a better average with a spread of prices. Now I know that there are a lot of alternatives if indeed I am not at all satisfied with their service.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:07:25
The problem is each share is about 100 characters long, maybe more so writing it is horrendous work.
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:21:43
So I want to turn my Shamir's Secret fragments into QR codes that can be scanned and not typed out because  they are hundreds of characters long. However I want to be able to do it offline for obvious reasons. I  am trying to save a website and put it on my offline Ubuntu laptop.
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:58:26
I actually own one already I am very happy with the job it does. However it comes with other complications. One being the 24 word seed. I feel that the piece of paper the seed is written on has become too valuable I don't really have a safe enough place to put it. I want a way to encrypt it further using SSSS but have fallen short. I want my family to have access to my Bitcoins if something happened. I don't want to give them the seed directly incase one of them was careless.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:27:09
That is really cool! Was it a desktop or laptop you built? btw I plan to get one of the recommended printers when my Mycelium entropy arrives. Do you have any experience with Shamir's secret? I am fascinated by the possibilities. What I have been trying to do is split my Trezors seed into partitions so that I can comfortably scatter them around the galaxy knowing they are safe if someone only gets hold of 1
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:23:11
We don't all have another Trezor lying around. However I really am considering it.

I was trying to do this the other day. I was listening to a talk by Andreas and he said he had a version of tails that had all the necessary files to create cold storage wallets for example like a downloaded version of a private key generated site. Do you have any idea how this is done?
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:00:58

Would you say its worth the effort? I'm considering having another go!
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:13:04

If you would like some gold and you can't buy an ounce of gold you buy a 1/2 ounce. You don't say "FUKIT, if I can't get an arbitrary value of something, I don't want it."

Watching this video made me so happy!! It is amazing how much changes in a year. They now have to release videos to combat bitcoin and not just shrug it off as a joke. At parts you can hear the fear in his voice. Damn its cool to watch this unfold before our very eyes. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:16:08
Having an extra one is good for recovery in case your Trezor breaks. In my case my Trezors will not all be in the same country. So I can allow a trusted person (or Untrusted for that matter) to sign the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:22:37
wouldn't this require the laptop to go online? Isn't that breaking the rules
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:27:32
I like your idea as well. It makes the coins hard to spend. But what is great about it is that you can still use it as a daily spending device by just making another seed for daily use. Only thing is Trezor restorations could get tedious.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:00:16
MultiSig is on its way. Also it's necessary for restoring.

SSSS = [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](
It is a way to share sensitive info without revealing the secret.
@_date: 2016-06-16 08:24:46
How about right now?
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:53:30

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:32:17
Honestly this is not great advice. Storing it "online" or on any device that uses the internet is a bad idea. Also trusting ones memory could also end badly.
Just write it down and keep it secure in preferably more than one location.

You are completely right, that was the joke! He was hitting out on Americans for being so apathetic to things that concern them when the are worded with jargon. Hence a congresswoman being cut off for the Biebs. So the Dick pick skit was to patronise people and say "if you want to talk about junk we will give you junk".
