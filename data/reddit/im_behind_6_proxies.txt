This is really cool stuff, never even knew it was possible. Have a feeling I will be saying that a lot in the future.
Keep it up

Mmmm... be careful with that sentiment.. it's the easiest way to get burned in such a raw market. That's probably exactly what the buyer wants you to think

can't wait until we pass the gold, s&amp;p, and then finally dow. gonna be good times.
if we ever hit those values, and then beyond that if we ever hit 50k I will be able to finally afford the house of my dreams (its on the moon)

This is probably the most bullish thing I have ever seen.

Bitcoin was rallied by 1 or 2 maybe 3 large buyers. Not by a concerted effort of a concered populus

Depends on what your reason is based on or grounded in. If you want to talk past performance then BTC is 'supposed' to bubble up again around may june or so

At this rate we will be at 100,000 by next monday.

seems like a bit of a stretch . I would be on downward movement at this point tbh, but im a hodler so I dont care either way . This market moves in bubbles, these short term fluctuations are whatever

I already sold 3MM worth of coins. Too late. Get ready for the drop
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:31:38
What you need is to put your coins in a hacker proof location.
This means offline.
How to do this?
1. Generate the private key offline. This could be generating a raw private key (bitaddress) or making a wallet (multibit, electrum).
The next important step is to put the important data (wallet, key) on an encrypted USB stick, and to make many copies.
You then want to distribute these USBs to multiple locations.
Since they are encrypted, no one will use them or know what is in them. Since your coins are offline, no amount of hacking superpower in the world can touch your money.

This is very true.. which really makes me wonder why the charts have been so consistent so far. It's interesting stuff.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:43:22

@_date: 2014-03-04 04:43:22
200k during december bubble, 100k now (nodes)
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:53:24
haha, moon buggy. I forgot that was a possibility. Drive over anytime. 24/7 laser shows on the darkside.
