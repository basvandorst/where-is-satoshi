Considering I never used bitcoin in my life, what do I do in case I solve one of these?

for  vowels are 0, consonants are 1, then you get 10 ascii chars... too late though :P

You probably used dcode.fr to ROT-5, right? I also did and the results are wrong. It eats up a few letters from the hex.

Congrats to whoever got it! Anxiously waiting for the write-up! :)

There was a hint, actually. The first bytes of the ROT-47-5'ed input are the ASCII codes for "50fff854cf3e". These happen to be the hex representation of the first few bytes of the SHA256 of "CoinGate" (which is why you get a lot of 0's when you xor them). So I guess if you thought of hashing the password and you had seen those bytes before, you would recognize them.

But ROT47 alone will not give you valid hex, right?

There's no option for importing, only "sweep", is that it?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:22:57
That wouldn't make any sense, how would they have reversed sha-256 to give us the actual challenge?

Stuck in the same place as SopaXorzTaker. ROT +/- 47 will give valid hex, then XOR with the password gives the bytes he posted. Tried to generate WIFs from that by "skipping" (extracting all contiguous 32-bytes starting from offset 1) but it didn't work. I find the "hash" hint strange, since usually it's very hard to reverse hashes...!

To be honest I'm pretty sure I have the solution for  so I'll split the money with whoever helps me figure out how to get it! :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:56:13
Give us a hint... :) Should we take it literally and not hash it? Or what type of hash should we be looking at? Is the string Sopa posted correct?
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:17:14
Cool! Congrats! I still have no idea what to do with the stuff I got. :P

Just wondering, but if you send money to someone honest without a reason, that person will probably simply give you back the money. It happened to me a couple of times on paypal, for example. So maybe he was expecting that the real Satoshi would simply bounce back those 5 pounds, then he would come to the spotlight and say "hey, that was me!!11!1". But the real Satoshi didn't, maybe because he doesn't exist, maybe because he doesn't give a crap, or maybe because he intentionally wanted to screw Wright's plan. When the money didn't bounce, he wrote that ridiculous note and slipped back behind the curtains.
