Yes, I agree it is a good reminder that Iran has, in the past, sought to hurt our economy by printing counterfeit US dollars. But you did say "Iran will continue counter fitting billions in US dollars", which is inaccurate. Just trying to clear that up. Also Iran is a country.

That article is from 24 years ago. If Iran had been printing billions of counterfeit US dollars every year for the past 24 years AND getting it into circulation, then we would have experienced hyperinflation a long time ago. Not saying that we won't.. just not from that. I'm still going to keep trading to BTC.

Wait how does the BTC earning work? You buy something in USD, ship it to someone else, and then they pay you in BTC?

How the hell do you buy something? Every time I search for an item or click a category under browse, it just searches for an hour and doesn't load. The web browser does the same thing. 
Edit: Ok it's working now. I think you have to be very specific when you search for something.

The "general public", AKA non-bitcoin users, will associate bitcoin with criminals now, just as they did when Ross Ulbricht's Silk Road got major publicity. It won't last long, and will ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. It's beginning to be recognized as a currency more and more worldwide instead of just a tool for trading. My opinion is that nothing can damage that anymore. Bitcoin will heal itself.
