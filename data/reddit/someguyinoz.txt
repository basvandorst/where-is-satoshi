Hahaha, your post demonstrates why using "bits" will be much easier for the average Joe than using a bunch of zeros - yours are all wrong! ��

Watching bitcoin over the last couple of weeks has made me sad.  I have the same feeling as a guy who *nearly* bought a lotto ticket with his usual numbers, but in the end never got around to it, only to find out the next day that his numbers were the winning numbers! 
I heard about bitcoin years ago, when it was still at just cents, or even less than a cent.  A few times over the years I have come so close to buying a small stack of bitcoin.  If only I had started then!  
I'm just getting in the game now and it's insane to think that my goal is to eventually have just one bitcoin, when I could have had hundreds (or thousands).  I could have retired by now!  I know I'm not alone.

Great advice.  I'll try that next time, as long as I'm using a wallet that lets me control the fees.  Thanks.

I wonder how many random 12 word seeds you would have to generate to accidentally create the same key as someone else...
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:07:06
Either way, it would be a tragedy if the wheels fell off!

Exactly.  I would never leave thousands of dollars in cash in my house, so there is no way I'd leave an unencrytped paper wallet lying around either. 
I do have a paper wallet, but I am using a BIP38 encrypted key with a strong passphrase.  I created it from a Ubuntu Live CD while offline then turned off the computer.  The only issue is that I printed the paper wallet to a network printer; that doesn't matter too much though, since the keys are encrypted and the passphrase was not printed.
I've also stored the private key electronically (online, in case of fire, theft or loss of the paper wallet), but it's encrypted and broken into 2 files, so you'd need to be able to decrypt both files to get the whole key.
I think I'd have to be pretty unlucky to get compromised by doing all the above, but I am still paranoid.

Holy shit! Now it's AUD$15.57 to move my bitcoin to my paper wallet! Fucking ridiculous. And I thought banks were bad! (It's around 226 satoshis per byte)
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:14:52
Don't forget that you guys are thinking in USD.  There are people around the world trading in bitcoin with other currency pairs. At the moment 1BTC=AUD$4856!!  That's just shy of AUD$5000!  That's a pretty magical number for us.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:57:07
I've had opportunities to get in earlier and regret not taking those, but at least I'm in now.  I'd love to have 2 BTC!  One to HODL and one to sell when the time is right (pay off my mortgage, maybe??).  Enjoy your 2 BTC :-)

As a user, I shouldn't have to care why or how the fee is high.  Multiple inputs, etc. Your average person isn't going to understand or care about that.  I told you how much the fee was.  In fact, I never made the transaction, BECAUSE of the fee.  I've left my bitcoin where it was.  It wasn't worth $7.50 just to move MY money to a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:04:32
I guess it's transitioning that way.  A lot of the hype just until recently was using it as a regular day to day currency.  "Buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin!".  Well not any more.  It's a shame, because if it could be both then it would be awesome.
I live in Australia, btw.  I get so confused with American ideas of "wire transfers", etc.  We just go online and transfer money between banks like it's nothing.  It's free for most people, too! 
Sure, sending money overseas is a little trickier, which is where bitcoin might help, though once you add the fees and then the shitty exhange rates to/from fiat currencies (if necessary), it's still not what it was originally touted to be.
I hope this will change in time.  As soon as I get my Ledger Nano S, my bitcoin will be going there and staying there until I'm a millionaire! ;-)

It's a good idea to substitute at least a few of the seed words for hints that only you would know.  That's how I keep my seed secure. Just make sure you really will know what your hints mean.  If anyone finds your seed, they can regenerate your wallet on their own device and take your bitcoins.

At least Coinbase has a bitcoin vault.  That is a great option for newer bitcoiners - it allows you to store your coins securely online.  I doubt anyone would be able to get your coins from there, and there are (advanced) ways to get them out if Coinbase ever goes down.

My weekly limits with Coinbase were slowing me down.  I started using btcmarkets as well, which gave me a much bigger limit, but it was frustrating watching the price rise and being unable to buy lower. 
Various times over the last 6 years I've thought about getting some bitcoin.  What a huge regret I never did!  I finally started about 2 weeks ago.  At that point 1BTC was around AUD$3100.  By the time I finally got a whole bitcoin it was at AUD$4400.  It's now around AUD$4800.
It's kind of felt like running after a train that's departing a station, desperately trying to jump on board the last carriage.  I feel like I've managed to jump on board just in time (before it becomes unaffordable for me).  Now we just have to hope that the train doesn't crash! ;-)

That video was a little repetitive. I watched for almost an hour but gave up in the end. I think I can guess how it ended.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:05:25
It can't work as a currency the way it is now.  I just tried to give a mate a dollar, but the transaction fee was going to be $3!  Tried to transfer my bitcoin to a paper wallet, but that transaction was going to cost me $15!  The way it is at the moment is not usable as currency.  Hopefully segwit can help with this?
(Don't get me wrong - I'm heavily invested in bitcoin now, too, so I want to see it work.  I'm just worried about these issues).

That's real estate... ;-)

Nice! Now that's how it should be.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:18:05
I put USD$110 into a bitcoin ATM 3 days ago and the rate was 1BTC=USD$4068!  Last time I ever use one of those bloody things!
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:30:15
With traditional banking I could do it for free.. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:00:05
There are some hurdles and dangers with paper wallets, though.  I didn't realise until recently that when transferring your BTC FROM your paper wallet back TO an electronic wallet, you MUST transfer the entire amount, otherwise you will lose the remaining balance!  I wonder how many people have found that out the hard way?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:18:14
Yes :-))))) Hahahaha
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:28:51
I'm not bitching, just stating a fact. I want bitcoin to work and become very successful, but I'm just worried that regular consumers will never bother if they are going to get slugged with fees liked this. 
I can withdraw that amount from my bank for free. I can send it electronically for free. I can move the cash from one wallet to another for free. I love bitcoin because in a nerd, but why would your average Joe even bother?
It might be 0.2% today, but it's still a couple of cups of coffee and tomorrow it might be more.
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:32:53
It did - probably about 7 different incoming transactions.  I didn't realise that made a difference.  Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:21:49
Maybe they'll totally fuck it up.  Let's hope not ;-)  BCH didn't have an impact, so hopefully this won't either...
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:44:15
Well, there is a 4th option.  For example, as unlikely as it is, what if someone has generated thousands or millions of keys and one of them just happened to be juta14x's key?  As unlikely as that is, it is still a possibility.  It is bound to happen to someone one day, so why not juta14x now?
