The good thing is that the reddit bitcoin community is becoming more and more marginalized.  The opinions and perspectives of the people here haven't been at all important in the Bitcoin universe for about a half a year now, and as time goes on even the small fragment of self-importance you guys are clinging to is becoming eroded.

*The very minds of the people we are trying to save.*
You hit the nail on the head right there.  Think of your own reaction to all the other people who want *to save* you.  I'm taking about the Jehovah's witnesses, the mormons, various cults etc..
Keep in mind that most of the world considers you guys, or at least the wacky libertarian fringe here, as complete nut jobs who are out of touch with the real world.  I think the best metaphor I've seen is that "Libertarians are like housecats.  They believe they have complete freedom, but really their entire lives are dependant on the system"

My girlfriend is getting her masters degree in psychology, we got really drunk one night and created an experiment.  When a rat pressed a leaver they got food, when they pressed a different leaver a couple satoshies were transferrered to a wallet we had assigned to them.  
Most of the rats chose food, but a couple, the smarter more libertarian rats... Oh let's be honest all the rats chose the food.  Not even after we played Andreas Antonpomplemouse at the canadian senate to them.  But they could have.  They had the choice!

Honestly, imho sidechains are the single most interesting development in Bitcoin in years.  Not sure if they will work.  It seems to me that once you move a coin out of bitcoin and onto a side chain you are exposing the coin to all the security vulnerabilities, counterfeiting potential, and hack-ability that you avoid with Bitcoin's mega mining.  
But if they can do it, and do it securely it will be a game changer.

A negative interest rate isn't about having to paying for insurance, security etc... Rather it is an idea economist thought up to try and force people to use their money rather than simply hold onto it.  The idea being that if you are actually spending your money you are helping the economy.
And personally I don't think this is such a bad idea.  But then, I'm a statist shill.  For the past few years corporations have been earning record profits, but rather than turning these profits into new jobs, or even derivatives, they've been mostly hodling for whatever reason.

Buttcoin does a good job of pointing at the crazies on this forum.  A lot of times in my opinion they take it too far:
1) when they post something obviously fake and over the top in trying to pretend, and get a rise out of the idiot true believers.
2) when they mock someone who has discovered to their horror that Bitcoin isn't the true massiah of finance.
And I'm not entirely sure that some of the regulars on r/buttcoin aren't every bit as crazy and obsessive as the libertarian wack-jobs here.
Still I read their sub every bit as much as this sub, and value both equally (i.e. Not very much)

After college, as a continuing ed course, I took a philosophy/political science class on the subject of social justice.  I thought it might be fun to argue the conservative side, even though I was taking the course at a very Liberal school, and happen to be a liberal myself.
There were four essays due in the course.   Submitted the first and got an F.  Did a hell of a lot of research for the second , got an F.  Did even more research and passed my third essay along to a friend with a ph.d in poli sci from the University of Chicago to look over and got an F.  Wrote the fourth essay in partnership with my friend and got an F.

Unless someone finds another way for it to work, the adoption it has right now is the most adoption it will ever have, and the only people  who will know what a "Bitcoin" is 5 years from now will be trivia geeks and people who write books about failed technological innovations.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:51:58
The "community" comes in with the concept "How do I take the strengths of the protocol without bringing along the wack jobs or their ideology" 
i.e. Libertarians don't like Ethereum or Ripple, but these currencies have all of Bitcoins strengths, let's make them mainstream, keeping the fringe to the fringe.
At certain point Bitcoin's growth will be limited by the community itself. Hardcore Libertarians make up less than 5% of the population in the United States and far less than that in the rest of the world. And when the other 95% of the population falls on a spectrum between "mild dislike" to "I can't stand your values" to "Libertarians are worse than Hitler" people are going to start looking for alternatives.

That's fine.  A lot of people see the numerous security holes in Bitcoin as flaws in the system.  I personally see them as a challenge for innovators to improve security.  That ultimately these innovations will improve online security overall.
But that still brings up the fact that until the people who think they are being clever by using the password "123456" to guard their accounts are safe, there is no real future for Bitcoin.

Though to seriously answer your question.  He's a Senator.  What real political clout he has he wouldn't waste on Bitcoin.  He would pass the matter on to an aide, deliberate on it, maybe if he was feeling really energetic and anti bitcoin, he might try to sneak something into a bill, where it would promptly be debated and removed.  
Worst case scenario, and Bitcoin becomes illegal through the underhanded political maneuvering of Ken Hess and Senator Colburn.  The Bitcoin Foundation would actually do what foundations are supposed to do, and challenge the issue in court.  Patrick Murck would probably have to make an argument in front of the Supreme Court (which is slanted very heavy to the conservative, libertarian side of things.) where he would say something like "Currency is Speech" at which point, the court would probably find that it is.
Bitcoin would gain more legitimacy with this than all the millions of you simple minded plebs begging Amazon to take your pennies, and even more than all of your moronic "We are going to tear down the banks, because they are afraid of us" bull crap.
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:51:16
The last sentence contains the flaw in your argument.  
"Often when discussing Bitcoin we hear, "I'm not a libertarian". But isn't a libertarian outcome what will be achieved if/when Bitcoin becomes universally adopted?"
If Bitcoin becomes universally adopted then yes, you are correct, a libertarian outcome is probably inevitable.  But most people in the world are not libertarians -- quite honestly very few people actually are.  
As a result, the likelihood of Bitcoin being universally adopted is about the same percentage there is of Libertarians -- say about a 5% chance.  And the percentage is probably way way lower than that.
Much more likely is the inevitability that people will look at Blockchain technology and say "here are the good parts" "here are the bad parts," throw out ideological factors and begin creating technologies that serve the other 95% of the population that: 
- doesn't like their bank, but doesn't hate it either, 
- who is suspicious of federal reserve policy but isn't willing to throw it entirely out.

You guys are both right.  It is shitty to steal someone's Bitcoins if they are lying around.  And if you can't protect your bitcoin's you deserve to have them stolen.
Which is exactly the reason why Bitcoin is destined to fail.  The sheer difficulty for even reasonably technically proficient users to protect their coins from being stolen is what will prevent adoption.  And until these basic security problems are solved, bitcoin adoption right now is as much as it will ever get.

I don't get how you "know with absolute certainty" because "competing currencies cannot exist in equilibrium in a truly free market". Those are some pretty monumental assumptions.
The value of any crypto currency exists entirely in its network effect.  Right now bitcoin is king in that regards, but it doesn't necessarily follow that this will always be true.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:43:31
There are no holes in the protocol itself, but the fact that someone can take a private key and irrevocably move any amount of currency out of a wallet is such a gigantic gaping festering gut wound of a hole in the design that it might as well be.
Things like multi-sig M of N transactions will undoubtedly help fix this, but they still as common as breathing yet.

Ah.  But I barely ever spend time on Buttcoin either.  I tried to for a while, but they tend to be every bit as cultish as the people here.  Watching r/bitcoin and r/buttcoin is a bit like watching a Jehovah's Witness telling a Pentacost that their interpretation of the gospel is wrong.

Of course Bitcoin has use.  I still think the block chain is a marvelous invention.  I disagree with Robinson that the coin is unnecessary.  I have never said any difference and I never will.
Do you know what the difference between science and religion is?  
Science is empirical.  You state a hypothesis, you test your hypothesis.  You examine the results.  People try to disprove your results.  As long as the results can be repeated and data doesn't exist which contradicts the position then that theory is accepted.  But people still keep trying to revise or investigate.
Religion accepts arguments on faith.  You accept doctrine because your leaders tell you.  You are not allowed to argue or challenge the doctrine.
So here are two videos:
You tell me which one is science and which one is religion.

You are absolutely right.  If you enjoy something, believe in something, are fascinated with something there is absolutely nothing wrong with sharing it.
I've actually gotten a couple of people into bitcoin myself and don't regret it.  I remember going around in a dizzy haze reading everything I could about the subject.  Staying up until 5 am in the morning watching BTC-e to see if my trades had gone through.  Waking up every hour or two to check the price.
I remember getting into arguments with anti-bitcoin folks about why they were wrong, why bitcoin was going to do to finance what the internet had done to communication.  Why the block chain was the future of technology.
But then something switched.  The community started to act more and more like fundamentalists.  The discussions began to be more about preaching to the converted than productively examining the technology.
I remember when I got started, it was shortly after I discovered the silk roads.  Back then people were absolutely sure that using Tor and Bitcoin and the dark web your transactions were absolutely untraceable.  If you took precautions there was absolutely no chance the fed would ever trace you.  
Then Ross got busted.  Suddenly the dialogue changed.  Suddenly everyone was dogmatically saying that you were pseudonymous.  That the block chain was actually a very good tool for law enforcement.  That you could be traced.
Don't get me wrong... I understand why the discussion changed.  What I didn't like was the bitcoin absolutism.  The willingness to hold one view then diametrically change that view but still fanatically hold the new position.  
I am sure that, had I said that "Tor isn't nearly as anonymous as you think.  That the identity's of the major vendors could be compromised."  If I had said these things in early 2013 I would be called a troll and passionately down voted.  
If you want another example.  Think of the 51% attack.  A little over a year ago, this kind of attack was considered one of the most horrible things that could happen in Bitcoin mining.  When Ghash closed in on it, it was major news on this forum.  People began frantically calling on miners to draw away or switch pools.
Nowdays even bringing up the chance that a 51% attack is a bad thing is cause for being labeled a troll.  People like Andreas Antonopolis have convince you loudly that the only thing that could happen should it happen is "you could buy 1 latte, then the block chain would shift and all the money you spent on the attack would be wasted, and if you had only mined bitcoin..."
I hate to break it to you, but zero day hacks happen for a reason.  There isn't an absolutely secure piece of software in existence.  So far Bitcoin has proven to be remarkably resilient, but that is in no way shape or form absolutely guaranteed.
So I like to criticize.  I like to examine assumptions.  I don't like dogma.  I don't like gospel.  And I'm not a big one on faith.
But in this forum any criticism has become unwelcome.  Viewpoints are taken on faith and repeated adnausium with barely any dissenting opinions.  
So sorry.  Cultish.

I got into bitcoin in 2011.  I switched to Ripple in 2013.  
I am not part of the current libertarian group-think (though I do have a tendency towards free thinking). think deflation would cause massive social issues in our society, and think that the authority of the state to regulate (as long as the regulations are smart and fairly applied) is one of the hallmarks of a functioning civilization.   
As a result I find it hilarious when you Bitcoiner's will happily denounce Ripple as being a Centralized Shitcoin without even knowing the tiniest thing about it, but if anyone makes even a minor criticism of Bitcoin.  Or when someone dares bring up an economic opinion outside of the myopic view presented here.  Or questions that Bitcoin will bring about a world free from hunger, war, poverty, disease, regulations, banks, greed etc  they are then labelled well....  Boom Troll.

Exactly the third one down on the list.  "
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks"

[Susan Athey]( and [Gene Sperling]( both are on the board of RippleLabs.  Tell me again how respected economists don't like Bitcoin?

But the word "all" is ideological.  In that case you are talking about universals and thus enter the realm of absolutes (as in mathematics and science) or mysticism (as in religion).

I don't own any Bitcoin, and I haven't given a damn about the price in over 2 years.  So if you think I wrote something about price somewhere I would be interested in seeing it because it would mean someone has hacked my account.
My bet is though is that you are imagining my name on something someone else wrote.

Personally the discussion -- not debate, but discussion -- I'd like to see would be between Paul Vigna &amp; Paul Krugman.  Neither person is bat shit crazy (i.e. Voorhees v. Schiff) unlike most of these sugested debates, rather both are fairly savy in their areas of interest and can at least understand where the other person is coming from.  Krugman may be an ideologue, but I don't get the sense that he is unable to listen to an intelligent nuanced argument.

And I will say it again.  You would not have Ripple without Bitcoin.

I gave up on buttcoin a while back.  I wouldn't say the circle jerk is worse, I would say it is roughly about equal.

By far the best Bitcoin book is the Age Of Cryptocurrency.  It has enough depth to be intersting to hard core bitcoiners but is really meant as an informative source for regular money people.  Economists, hedge fund folk, stock brokers, journalists etc.  so it is lite on the technical ins and outs of the block chain.

Don't bother you can't change anything here.  is an ideological cesspool.  Appreciate bitcoin for what it is, a brilliant yet imperfect prototype, and then move on.  Let the utter wackos here live in their imaginary little utopia.

What's the point in responding?  One group of cultists shouting at a different group of cultists.  Watching r/Buttcoin and r/Bitcoin fight is a lot like watching Pentecostes and Jehovah's Witnesses yell at each other about biblical interpretation. 
Words like "basically owns bitcoin development" and "centralize all development through himself" are basically ideological/demagogical rather than factual and don't deserve a response.

So what?  The price only matters to the people speculating on the price.  And Buttcoiners.  And Journalists.
The pure libertarians see 1 Bitcoin being equal to 1 Bitcoin and the price in US dollars being irrelevant because they want a parallel system that has no ties to the US dollar.
The people who see Bitcoin as a payment system want a system that lets you buy Bitcoin instantly and then sell it again a millisecond later so the price only matters for that small insignificant fraction of a second you are actually holding Bitcoin.  For them, the trustless network is what matters. It doesn't matter what the value of a single Bitcoin is, only that it has value in the first place.  This system would still function every bit as easily if bitcoins were worth $0.00001 as $1000.

The problem with your logic is that it flows from the 90% of payments are already digital, why should I go with something as insecure as Bitcoin if I don't have to.
Which is circular logic.  
First of all all digital payments at the moment are insecure.  It doesn't matter if they are Blockchain based or not.  The recent Russian banking hack, the Target hack, the Anthem Hack, the JP Morgan Chase hack etc... Our banking system is not at all secure.  What it is is regulated and insured which is something entirely different.
You bring up Google Wallet and Square and let's add Paypal to that.  These are convenient centralized systems that work perfectly for regular people.  I would use any of these over Bitcoin in a heart beat.  That said, Square lost 100 Million dollars to payment network fees last year.  There are reason why the the people behind Paypal, Square and Google Wallet are excited about Bitcoin.
So the question really becomes "How will ACH be overhauled?"  My bet is that JP Morgan, BAM etc... cobble together some sort of Ripple rip off in order to protect their fees and correspondent banking cartel.  So the question is how good will it be, how expensive will it be to use, how many people outside of the US will use it, how much money will they spend to upgrade it regularly, will they focus on innovation or will they let it sit (like they did with ACH) for 40 years.

Let me rephrase that:  who isn't bat shit crazy to the 95% of the population who think Austrian Economics is bat shit crazy.

Honestly a merchant setting up Bitpay is absolutely hamless.  I mean if he paid a programmer hundreds of dollars or there were tens of dollars in fees it wouldn't be worth it, but really... 
Adding a free service simply by turning on a plugin, on the off chance that a customer wants to use bitcoin?  True, I seriously doubt this guy will ever get any sales.  But who cares.  The customer is always right, and if one wants to pay in bitcoin, accpting bitcoin is simply good customer service.

I've read Robinson's book.  I wrote this critique of it elsewhere, but I am repeating it here. 
It isn't enough to know Bitcoin's flaws. You have to first know why Bitcoin is groundbreaking.
Robinson talked to a lot of people. He listened to Krugman and Schiller who said "Bitcoin is a terrible store of value" and looked at Bitcoin and sure enough these world recognized experts were right.
He listened to Mark Andreeseen who said look at the power of the block chain. And sure enough he saw that power.
He listened to the Bitcoin community and saw that they were cultish and frenzied, and said "this is not a good thing" and he was also right.
He listened to the people who are against Bitcoin and heard their opinions. And realized that there was a lot of validity to what they said.
And so he wrote his book. 
But the thing is Bitcoin is much more than the sum of the highly polarized viewpoints about it. He doesn't actually get Bitcoin, he just gets the dogma surrounding bitcoin. His is a shallow surface comprehension.
He would have been far better served if he had asked himself. What is money? What is value? What is ownership? How does Bitcoin fit into this? What objectively are its strengths &amp; weaknesses? Can these weaknesses be overcome? what are the strengths &amp; weaknesses of the current system. Does one clearly overpower the other. Now. In five years. In Ten Years.
If he had bothered to do that, he would have written a profoundly different book. A far better book. So while he got his conclusions sort of right, overall it was a C+ effort.

In a sense the analysis isn't outdated.  In terms of Bitcoin, if I send you 1 BTC, I am the Payer, You are the Payee and the Protocol functions as the Bank.
