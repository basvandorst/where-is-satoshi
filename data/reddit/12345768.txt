because you are living somewhere they own... how is it not hard to understand? your country is owned by your government you have the privilege of living there only because they wrote rules to dictate you can, the only freedoms you are given are the ones they allow you to have.
you are openly forced to give the state money because you are openly living on their land.
it's like if i moved into your land and you found out and gave me 3 choices: pay, jail, or leave.
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:38:56

because OP is making things up. i'm so confused as to why people are under the assumption bitcoin is going to kill banks, it's like these people only have a checking account and don;t realize most people have various loans and investments at their bank.

no, it makes sense, if i parse a attempted transaction where there's actually 3 different potential transactions valued at $1, $100 and $1 million which one should i send?
the answer is none, you should only send a transaction when there's one, the presence of n transactions means n-1 are invalid which really means the entire attempt is invalid, by guessing you have at best a 50% chance of choosing the single correct transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:44:30

i think they take bitcoins and hand out money.
@_date: 2014-08-19 12:18:13
IMO aproblem right now is that companies don't truly accept bitcoin, they use a 3rd party which allows bitcoin to be used to pay for good, but the merchant recieves fiat, this means the bitcoin is sold on an exchange(or somewhere) instantly or soon after it's accepted, this means someone has to buy that back or the price goes down.
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:04:44

yes your opinion as a non lawyer is correct clearly, this is because the judge is corrupt and the guvment is conspiring and taking all your freedums.

1) 100% of your savings is in bitcoin
2) you paid $5 a coin
3) you haven't had losses
this means that you for sure have not bought coins in at least the last 9 months, and the average cost of your coins being $5 means you are saving less money now than you did before if any.
also finally for your math skills.
$5 to $475 is only 9500% you lost 500% of your value since last time you checked bro.

downvoted for harshness i guess.
let's pretend i'm paid in bitcoin and get paid every 2 weeks, if my pay period was last Thursday i would have lost 4.5%(8.4% by 11am) of my remaining funds, that's more than double the inflation rate for my country in all of 2014.

yes and we are shipping things with magic fairies right? "durrr openbazar" is the stupidest argument ever, all that does is decentralize the seller(s) it doesn't actually hide people, if i'm shipping 100 packages a month then someone is maybe going to notice, 10k for sure, it's not rocket science.
you come in here thinking you have a magic solution without a single thought as to feasibility, yes bitcoin is pseudo anonymous and yes so is openbazar but that's as far as it goes, as soon as you deal with real goods everything goes out the door if even 1 person in your supply chain reports things you are fucked, even if no one does you might still get caught.
all that being said, do you think if openbazar took off and took 100% of the market amazon wouldn't just switch over? they have a massive massive advantage with their shipping times and guarantees and only a complete idiot would think they would just roll over and die.

uh no,(according to VISA) for swipe transactions the merchant is supposed to:
1) compare card # to the receipt
2) compare name to the receipt
3) compare the signature
if the card isn't signed you need to check ID and force them to sign the card in front of you and then compare the signature to the ID, if they refuse this you void the transaction and/or refuse to accept the card.

no it's not an here is why
1) your site needs to answer questions that google/stack exchange can't. This represents &lt;1% of programming questions
2) to do this you need lots of highly specialized users who are also very active. 
3 a) the incentive is to solve the question, this means that users will collaborate less because they want money. 
3 b) because many questions are highly specialized the person who answers it might not be giving a correct answer but the user will see it "works" and pay them, and maybe no one will be able to validate the solution until after.
4) who is the primary user of these sites? it's students, since there's better solutions for students they will use those. when they leave school and work they will continue to use the things they are familiar with.
so let's think about this, you have a very specialized site, that the primary user base for this type of site will not use, doesn't necessarily provide the best answers and requires lots of active highly skilled people to be visiting every day. yup seems like a good idea.
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:10:00

I completely understand, but here you are saying that you don't want to be part of a country and then making excuses when i tell you how to do that. 
clearly if you think a passport has value then you are acknowledging that being part of your country has value and that value is something people pay taxes for.
so stop making excuses and leave, or stop complaining that taxes are theft when you are taking advantage of what those taxes provide. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:24:48
listen you are the one that doesn't understand, to create a company in almost any country it requires person(s) to take ownership(aka centralization) and it requires person(s) to ship physical goods.
you have nothing to add because you don't know how to do this, you explained a way to create a decentralized distribution of dividends which is great and all but there's still owner(s) of the company who have complete legal control. hence not decentralized.

the only thing that would put banks out of business is if no one would ever store money in them again, and no one would want loans and no one would want investments.
so let's pretend we live in a 100% bitcoin world.
now you might be thinking "well hey, bitcoin means no one needs to have checking accounts, this means they have no money to loan" and you are kind of right.
but... banks simply remove all fees for accounts and offer 1% interest for keeping your money there, suddenly people would be stupid not to put money in banks, they get 1% interest a year, still insured by the government.
but uh oh this cuts into banks profit margins, but that's not even necessarily the case, bitcoin replaces huge amounts of the existing financial systems that they pay lots and lots of money for(because COBOL devs are expensive), and even taking 0 fees and giving 1% interest banks make huge amounts of money.
Bitcoin doesn't stop people needing loans
Bitcoin(initially) doesn't stop people using credit cards, as long as a store accept credit at the same price, people will sue credit for rewards. 
Bitcoin doesn't stop people wanting investments, it's stupid to keep your money in an account when you can grow it, even if they money increases every year. think, would you want to have 100 bitcoins where the buying power increases by n% a year or 100 bitcoins where the buying power increases by n% and the number of bitcoins you have increases by 3-7%
if you think bitcoin is going to put banks out of business you don't understand how banks operate or how bitcoin works, worst case scenario(for banks) is they offer some better services.
you somehow think that being able to store money electronically is the same as being a bank and it's not even close.

well it's 4(?) developers, they are hired to write things, i wouldn't be surprised if all they did was start coding based on specs. but obviously we don't know without proof and i don't want to point fingers. at the same time if some sort of analysis was done before it would be so easy to post to prove that all this BS everyone is raising is just BS. and yeah when you are getting paid 100k a month it's hard to point at an existing product that will cost 1k for a license and a few months dev work when you could keep yourself employed for years instead.


i'm sure, SMF is only of dozens of forum platforms though, and threaded posts with hierarchical tags do exist.


true and yet not true, php/mysql is pretty performant(event with how much php sucks ass), facebook used php/mysql when they had a few hundred million unique users a day, &gt;100x more than the bitcoin forums. also the issues with scale aren't necessarily with the language used but how fast you can throw more hardware at the problem, which php/mysql isn't as suited for. in this case it might be premature optimization, but who knows. the bitcoin talk forums are never going to get as much traffic as say something like reddit or twitter or facebook so there's also that, many of the problems that these companies have with scale are actual limitations with languages or platforms.


sure but is it needed?


relational databases scale horizontally just fine and have for a long time now, generally programmers don't have to deal with this problem so they never realize that, it's not all that hard to create database clusters and such. but that being said just because you have a database doesn't necessarily mean you will normalize it, there's lots of design patterns for big data, hell mysql's default engine is not even transaction, something a traditional database would not want.  reddit for example is/was(?) using postgreSQL with what was basically kvp table for most of their stuff, something a DBA from 10 years ago would cry over but hey it works. no reason why a fancier solution is needed.


sure it might be a problem with SMF, again there's more products and more solutions, how much of a problem would it be if we could spin up more servers on demand, what if we switched products? these are the types of questions i would normally like to see data for if i was involved in this


Also if you start adding functionality that the SMF architecture really isn't prepared for very well, performance suffers a lot.
oh for sure the new software is going to be(or should be) better, that's not the issue, the issue is shoudl the work ahve been done in the first place

you are stating that the "old way" is going to crumble, yet have no evidence of that.
the most likely scenario if bitcoin ever becomes successful is that it will replace cash, yet all the infrastructure like banks will still exist because things like loans and investments are very useful tools that people want to use.
this means that the "old way" is never going to change for the average person, just the name of the thing they use.

here's your problem, no it doesn't.
so elt me compare where i live, vs the nearest condo(1 block away)
cost to rent a 1200 square foot apt: 1300
cost to buy a 1200 square foot condo: 400k + 500 condo fees + property tax + maintenance
at the 2.54% im approved for and 25% down(cause any less and you pay insurance)
mortage payment: 1200
property tax: 300
condo fees: 500
house prices rise at 4% a year, cost of rent increases by inflation(2% avg) and indexes run at 6-7%(plus dividends), do the math yourself.
 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:03:23


except some things actually need to core to change, that's why there are devs working on the core. for example bitcoin can't scale, this needs to be resolved before it becomes a problem,

@_date: 2014-09-08 12:38:19
no it's not, let's say scalability(or something else) was a problem today, the solution would take 6+ months given current dev times, this means that there's a 6+ month delay where the network has issues.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:28:46

bitcoin also has almost no market penetration and is easily replaced, and index fund is a safe 6-7% a year for 40 years
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:08:37
because the price has next to nothing to do with "good news".
Microsoft accepting Bitcoin via Bitpay means that a bunch of people are going to buy stuff with Bitcoin, Bitpay then sells those coins which puts downward pressure on the market and if there's not also a increased demand for buying bitcoin the price goes down.
as we add new ways to spend bitcoin more and more people are spending them, this means more downward pressure.
there's also 3600 new coins mined a day or a 10% inflation rate this year, more if you ignore coins assumed lost like Satoshi's coins.

@_date: 2014-09-18 12:09:28
the way i see it is that there's 3 things.
1) people that mine bitcoin for profit need to sell it or use it to see a profit, with the price slowly declining over the last 9 months it's hard to justify holding all coins, more and more miners will sell at least a fraction of their coins to recoup costs or running hardware
  
2) all the new places that accept bitcoin are really just taking cash and a 3rd party is converting bitcoin to cash at the time of the sale.
both of these are putting bitcoins up for sale, now lots of people are buying bitcoin but since there are more people selling the price is slowly  going down. 
also there's little reason to buy bitcoin other than the potential that it might be worth more later so it's not like there's a huge demand to buy.
what's even more interesting is that there's a lot of companies who require bitcoin to be successful to operate, i always wonder if they might try and manipulate the price somehow, there's incentive to do so as it's unregulated and could generate more money for them.
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:44:35

social media is a terrible comparison, let's look at Facebook, in 2007 it opened to the public, it took Facebook 3 years to go from public access to having 500 million total users, 3 years after that they had a billion users who used the site at least once a month.

in the free market a big company can make other smaller companies go out of business by either buying them, working with them, or creating a situation where the smaller company cannot compete, in the end you have a handful of companies that exist in a sector that will price things at the price point that generates the most profits.

because they thing the potential is worth it long term.
SP500 indexes are something that are volatile but people invest in long term, in 2000 it lost 30% of its value and in 2008/2009 it might have lost like 50% of it's value, but over 10 years you see gains of 6%(ignoring dividends) average, over 25 years that number is 7%.
that being said it's obviously not as secure a choice as the SP500, Bitcoin is more like investing in something like Nortel or Google, it's new and might go up, might go down who knows, it does have some things which make it potentially great, but that's not the only reason why a product succeeds.

everything pays compound interest, there's a huge difference between &lt;1.5%, 3-4% and the &gt;6% payouts you can get depending on what you buy and your risk tolerance.
why use a savings account for 0.5-1.25% interest when a bond fund pays 3-4%? if i'm investing over 40 years why not have money in things like the  SP500(and equivalents for other countries/regions) the sp500 averages about 5-7% +dividends which are about 1.75%. 
the real issue is that when you go to a bank for investment advice you have a huge conflict of interest, banks will either sell you low risk things like GICs(not sure the name for other countries) because you have 0 risk tolerance and this results in laughable interest, OR the bank/adviser will sell you mutual funds which are profitable for the bank/adviser.
on the other hand just buying stocks yourself is hard, you are up against people with more knowledge and education and more time and better tools, it's a game that you will eventually lose at. 
this is why i think the average person(obviously not everyone) should take a look at index funds, they have much lower fees than mutual funds, perform better than the average mutual fund and are diverse enough to mitigate risk. there's also lower risk funds like bond funds.
[this]( is a canadian example of it, i'm sure there's ones for other countries around too. and to put this in perspective my portfolio has an average gain of 6.5% a year, if i put in $500 a month from 25-65 i would retire a millionaire(not that it means as much in 40 years heh), also the more you save earlier the better, the money you save at 25 will be worth 10x as much when you retire 40 years later,
500/month is not impossible on a 40-50k a year salary depending on the situation, although some sacrifices might need to me made.
it's worth taking time to explore other options as well, this is what i am familiar with i'm sure there's other ways to make money (as well as thousands of get rich quick schemes)

it's not that mutual funds don't perform, it's that:
mutual funds 1) have high fees. and 2) rarely beat index funds when it comes to long term returns.
go check your info on your mutual fund, what's the MER? it's probably somewhere in the range of 2%, this means that every year the fund manager is taking 2% of your money for themselves, if you were to buy the exact same investments you would have an extra 2% returns a year... at the same time index funds(or ETFs) have fees that are about 0.3%.  
so go figure out what your mutual fund contains and compare it to a collection of index funds with the same allocation of assets, does your mutual fund beat that? what about if you look back 10/20/40 years? sure with a managed fund they are putting more effort into making money then just tracking the sp500, but overall most funds fail at this.

technology changes fast, just look at the new algorithms created to solve specific problems this century or even in the last 25 years.
what if someone comes up with a way to solve bit coins hashing algorithm in a non linear fashion?  suddenly they can mine blocks way way faster than everyone else. what do we do? do we change the hashing algorithm and render all current miners obsolete? this weakens the network, but the network is already weak because one actor is able to mine all the blocks.
or what if someone finds a way to compromise bitcoins pub/private key encryption system? bitcoin is now without security?
there's also all the problems and their solutions that we don't even realize exist yet, what if in 400 years humans live all over the stars and light speed is a limiting factor for bitcoin but someone comes up with a coin that has a mining process that can be published instantly once solved regardless of distance.
it's naive to say that bitcoin can solve any problem, let's take data structures as an example, 25 years ago things like MapReduce and NoSQL didn't exist, now they are commonly used to solve certain problems, 50 years ago we didn't even have b+ trees the building block of a SQL database, 75 years ago the concept of a b tree didn't exist, the most basic data structure. 100 years ago computers as we know them didn't even exist, a computer was someone who solved math problems you gave them.
the future of technology is a giant unknown, there's no way you can state an existing piece of tech can adapt, everything gets replaced eventually, the question is only how long can something be used before it's rendered obsolete.
bitcoin is very good today and probably will be for years and years, but it's not infallible, nothing is, and that needs to be recognized.

@_date: 2014-11-12 15:32:30
ok let's compare 2 people
person 1 has 1 million dollars in their savings account
person 2 lives paycheck to paycheck.
when one dollar buys 2% more every year person 2 gets a of 2% raise but sicne they can buy more there's no incentive for employers to also give them a raise, person 1 gains 2% buying power a year which would be 20k+ a year. The rich person can do nothing and gain wealth the poor person never get's a raise because they gain buying pwoer every year anyways
when the dollar buys 2% less a year person 1 needs a 2% but is otherwise unaffected, person 1 is losing 2% of their stored money a year or 20k, 19.6k, 19.2k.... the rich person needs to spend their money or they lose it. the poor person needs to demand a raise every year and the rich person needs to spend money or they lose it.
overall inflation works better for everyone, when there's no incentive to spend money until you absolutely have to it means less goods are purchased which means a smaller economy and all that entails.

and people that buy stocks generally don;t buy things that don;t produce money.
it's like buying a pile of gold vs buying a sp500 tracker, historically both go up, but the gold isn't paying anyone dividends, also 1/4 of the gains you get from a tracker like that is dividends.
not to mention if you invest in bitcoin you own some bitcoin, if you invest in a company you own a share of a whole bunch of assets including future assets, if i own a share of google and one of the devs working there makes something that's worth billions of dollars i profit(like adsense), if i own a bitcoin and a dev makes something unrelated to bitcoin i see no profit because i only own a share of the bitcoin product and not also a share of that devs work(that he produces at work)
this is the main problem with investing in bitcoin and why the smarter players are going to invest in things that complement bitcoin and will succeed greatly if bitcoin does but could also succeed or be worth money if bitcoin doesn't.
like imagine a theoretical world where in 10 years someone comes out with a perfect crypto currency that bitcoin cannot replicate because of whatever technical reasons, bitcoin becomes almost worthless but the companies don't they spend a few weeks and now their software works with this new coin too, they might lose value short or medium term but they are no longer worthless.

@_date: 2014-08-25 11:26:26


what about in 20+ years when bitcoin is "too big to fail"? if systems are reliant on bitcoin and the miners have a reduced reward what is stopping them from demanding more transaction fees? miners would ahve the same power Paypal/Credit cards/banks have now.
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:45:04
the problem isn't that bitcoin is scary or alien, it's that it replaces something that doesn't need to be replaced. payment systems are not a bottleneck for the majority of the world.

i think we misunderstand each other here, i'm not suggesting this. what i am suggesting is that there's issues where if X ever happens (which it will eventually) then we have a problem, these are things that will happen in 5+ years, given that huge span of time they can be worked on slowly and safely.
at the same time if we look and go "oh well we can do this in 8 years" and 8 years later the problem happens now suddenly we are brute forcing things.

but a company can't get bitcoins without first? to buy on an exchange there's a potential markup/fee and to pay out thousands of dollars a week that's going to add up, not to mention they would have to calculate and pay taxes/government fees and shit in FIAT, at what point is that easier then paying &lt;$100 per pay period for a payment processor to handle everything? 
it's a tough situation, and someone needs to bit the bullet eventually, but in a world where everyone cares about themselves and is greedy, who will?

@_date: 2014-07-08 14:18:57
you also have to weigh that against inflation, the longer you defer paying the less you pay, hence having debt is good because buying power of the debt decreases every year. 
credit cards are in now way a comparison to deflation.
also less than half of US households maintain a credit card balance. so clearly it's not the dominant way of purchasing.

@_date: 2014-09-23 17:50:13
he is mostly circlejerking.
in all seriousness though, when a new retailer accepts bitcoin, they usually accept bitcoin through someone like bitpay, this means that the retailer is still getting paid in USD and the bitcoins used need to be converted to USD at some point to fund the sale. This puts more bitcoins up for sale meaning that the price is pushed down as more people use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:57:37

@_date: 2014-09-06 18:58:30
here let me break down the problems for you
1) you need a way for everyone to convert their money into bitcoins
2) you need to train everyone in how to use bitcoins
3) you need to make sure every citizen can use bitcoin(what do people with no internet/phone do?)
4) all shops need to be able to accept bitcoin
5) you need to make sure that all bitcoin transactions must happen at least as fast as cash does now
and there's more, lots more, who is going to solve these? it would probably take more than a year just to do a feasibility report and come up with solutions to major issues.

i disagree, consumer adoption is key, merchants don't really save anything with bitcoin if no one uses it to buy their products and will go all the way down the supply chain, a company can't use bitcoin to cut costs if they can't be paid in bitcoin, not only that but company to company money transfer costs are often lower since it's bank transfers and not people proccessing things like a VISA payment, this means that there's less to save(if anything). Also  given the volatility no one wants to hold on to bitcoin for any period of time, it's too risky, a 1-2% change in bitcoins price over a day could negate any savings.

you need to realize that neither of us are the smartest person here, people are creating solutions to problems that either of us would find impossible, obviously i can't give you an example of something infinitely better than bitcoin because if i could i would have made it.

poorer people don't have money to protect from inflation in the first place and uneducated people with money just don't protect it.
obviously no one keeps money in the bank but in both situations you can invest, today i get 7% a year or 5% after inflation, with deflation i would get 7% more dollars a year and each dollar would be worth more.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:51:44
but the cost of owning eats into the equity, you pay interest every year(3%+), property tax(about 1% where i am), condo fees(if applicable) and maintenance(estimated at 1-2%).
so yes your house is gaining value, but you are paying 2.5% of it's appraised value in fees + &gt;3% on the portion you have a mortgage on.
my investments cost me 0.3-0.35% a year in fees and have an average return of 7%, my reduced cost of living from renting(yes renting is cheaper price wise) also means i save more per year. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:59:22
no it's not, i've been saying this for a long time now but bitcoin does not replace banks. bitcoin is simply a tool people can use to store and transfer money.

ignoring all the flaws with decentralization what if the solution involves a private ledger, suddenly the blockchain no longer works. you aren't a software developer, sometimes it's impossible to take features from one product and add them to another due to the design.


Bitcoin is a product, the format in which the Bitcoin product sends data is a protocol.
that aside, a protocol means nothing, there's thousands of dead protocols floating around, some which have had lifespans of &lt;5 years. 
i don't understand why you think Bitcoin is somehow going to history and become a product that somehow cannot be rendered obsolete.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:20:39
this isn't about bitcoin this is about taxes, the form of money is an abstraction that doesn't matter.
by living in a country you get a whole bunch of services, to pay for these services you follow their rules and pay taxes, if you don't like this then you should stop agreeing to the contract, which of course means leaving. if you don't leave but stop following the rules then you are breaking the contract and will be punished.
seems pretty simple to me.

@_date: 2014-12-27 20:53:58
this is an incredibly naive way of looking at things, for every successful piece of software that has lasted more than a couple years there's hundreds if not thousands of failed or obsolete projects.
If history has taught us anything it's that someone always does something better, the question is not IF they will it's WHEN. this might change when we get close to the hard limitations on what the universe allows but software like bitcoin is not even remotely close to that.
not only that but bitcoin has hard limits like the block rewards, what if  someone comes up with a solution which guarantees a transaction completes in &lt;5 seconds, bitcoin can't use that it would turn bitcoin into something else.
there's also soft limits, code may not be compatible with how bitcoin is designed, let's say someone invents a solution that is better in every way, bitcoin could use the same methodologies to improve itself but it would require major re factoring which means massive testing would take &gt;1 year, now we have a solution that's better today or the promise bitcoin might be just as good in a year or more, at the same time the new solution will have a year of dev time to continue to improve itself.
what if the new product is licensed in a way that the core algos or code is patented and can not be used in competing products? well now bitcoin can never do those things.
anyone who writes software is aware of the risk of someone doing what they do but better, only normally companies like Microsoft or Google will just buy up the smaller companies, obviously Bitcoin can't buy up anything.
If you think bitcoin is invulnerable you should really reevaluate your position, it's pretty much guaranteed that bitcoin will be replaced, the question is will it be in 5 years or 500? or will bitcoin just fail first?
none of this makes bitcoin bad, it just makes it the same as every other piece of technology in existence.

@_date: 2014-10-05 20:06:16


no it doesn't and this is the point, just because bitcoin has limits does not mean every cryptocurrency ever will have the same limits.
im not sure if you understand how software works, but every choice when designing software comes with consequences, some of bitcoins choices are fundamental reasons why bitcoin is bitcoin, now that's not good or bad but because of that something else will eventually come along and be better and bitcoin won;t be able to replicate that, the question is, will that be in 5 years, 50 or 500? no one knows

Yes when you look back it's easy to see good and bad things to invest in.
However the future doesn't work like that, this is why it's a good idea to invest in various things so that you mitigate risk, if we can learn anything from the past it's that diversity means safer while still generating acceptable returns.
For example Nortel looked like a great investment from like oct-dec 2006(if memory serves me right) where it tripled in value, 2 years later it was worth 1/25 of that price. 
I have a portion of my investments in bitcoin and it has generated high returns, but that doesn't mean i should have 100% of my portfolio in bitcoin just because it's done well in one 18-30 month time slice.
i could say the same for my CAD index funds which have outperformed every other index i own, i still don't go all in on it or even up the percentage i own.

if your real estate has made 180% in the last 6 years after you factor in property tax and interest on the mortgage you are outside the range of what normal people would get.
historically the SP500 outpaces housing prices, obviously there's no initial lump sum to invest with the an SP500 index compared to a mortgage, but there's also no fees and no costs.
for many people(like me) renting + saving the difference puts me ahead long term.

but of course let's make shit up because even though 43% is a nice big number 79% looks so much better and it's not like anyone actually fact checks.
the only number that comes close to 79% in that whole article is figure 11 where 80% of people who responded(note people as individuals not  representatives of companies) think that virtual currencies will overtake paper ones. 
also note that 60% of respondents already have virtual currency payment implemented where they work, obviously either this survey has  biased data gathering or people are defining virtual currencies as something else.

classic diversion tactic, but in this case it's you that's spewing bullshit, i'll bite though.


you make a bunch of statements saying that existing forum software is not up to par with what is needed, you have no citations or anything though. clearly you have more insight into this then most people though since you are commenting.
before anyone should have even started making custom software they should have made a required feature list, made a list of existing forum software solutions and doing some analysis. 
you are either pulling shit out of your ass or have actual information, i'm going with pulling shit out of your ass since "extra features no one wants" is straight up BS, these are things you can turn off.
so straight up, show me some cost benefit analysis you have done or a list of features that no existing solution(or 3rd party addon) can provide.


where's the other bitcoin stuff?


ok and? that's not what the money is for, the money was for making things better, not making free projects for everyone


it's a forum dude, it's some nested folders of threads, how freaking hard is that? what custom tailored stuff do we need here?

because someone is spending more doesn't mean that there is inflation, if i decide to live in a house that is twice as large and as a result pay more, it's not because housing costs have gone up.

i signed up for the website when it first came out just cause(i'm on the 3 pages of users)
some things i noticed:
* website is clearly an outsourced php project, not that these are bad but it's a generic site template and the background image for the banner is from [another site](
* The facebook likes were(are) clearly paid for, &lt;20 instructors signed up, the first 3 clearly being employees and already &gt;1.5k likes with 0 courses taught.
* the number of online users is a lie, &gt;70% of joined users are always online? 
* the "featured experts" where always the same 3 people who happened to be the first 3 users to sign up. now it's a different 3 people.
* the categories are lacking and hard coded, even though you can put in different keywords they are never added or indexed, but the ceo was asking what skills he should add if some where missing.
* not a single "instructor" i have ever seen has a review or any classes taught/hours, this means what a grand total of 0 people have asked for lessons? this site has made no money? what's the point?
i applaud the kid for trying but this is clearly him losing money, it makes me sad, whatever company he is outsourcing to or whoever is basically taking his money. i know you can get some great devs for cheap in Asia, but there's also terrible ones and how is a 15 year old supposed to know? also how far does 100k go? that sounds like not much.

yes and those companies still have value, they have a potential product that they own, employees and other assets. compare this to owning bitcoin, there's no assets, no company, no employees, no product even, anyone could make a bitcoin clone.
this is why stocks have more value than bitcoin. bitcoin is 100% speculation, why is bitcoin more valuable than litecoin for example? they both solve the same problem.
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:17:32

obviously not, but at the same time you can't say the solution to any problem will "be implemented when we get to it" when the dev cycle is so slow, they should working on those fixes well before they happen in that case.

if you want a source find the number of sales per day for every single retailer you can then compare it to the &lt;100k bit coin does in total transactions you will find that while the original post may not be entirely accurate, when you looks at an aggregate of all retailers there's thousands of sales per second maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands of sales per second.
[alibaba alone did &gt;3k sales per second on nov 11]( it would have them a whole 31 seconds out of that to break 100k transactions, that's one single(very large) retailer out of hundreds of thousands that exist in the world.

Bitcoin allows people to operate in the digital economy without being trusted or trusting a bank. This is a big thing. And "less intuitive" is bullshit, because scanning a QR code and carrying a balance is not complicated.
bitcoin isn't the first service to do this, prepaid credit cards have been around for a long time.

seriously? it's not exactly a hard concept that a centrally controlled entity is easier to control, that's one for the core benefits of centralization.


The US dollar is going down in a slow steady manner, the value of gold is fairly unpredictable. notice how the gold prices are in 2014 dollars? it's impossible to call gold stable when over 10 years it might go to 1/5 of it's value, or maybe not? this makes something a shit unit of currency which is why gold is a commodity and not a currency.
Even look at house prices(your example) their value is less predictable than the buying power of the dollar.
I get that you hate fiat for whatever reason but the fact is that it's stable and predictable. The British pound is more than 300 years old so clearly fiat can work long term.

countries like Somali are pretty much the definition of a libertarian country. little to no government and everyone has the freedom to make their own choices.
And yes we can cherry pick details, there's some things that you can define as libertarian, you could also look at how in the times of no regulation a  factory forcing 16 hour work days where people slept in a  bunk 50m away from the production line were way more effective when it comes to production.
you can also see that a place where all the basic services like health care, post secondary education, roads, police and even minimum standards of living are free and yet the after tax income is barely effected and is often higher than places that do not offer these.
anyone who thinks socialism is bad is failing to see even part of the bigger picture. you know why America sucks? it's cause you pay 10s of thousands for healthcare and then another 100k for education when other countries get it free/for a fraction of the cost.

bitcoin let's a bunch of people share tokens and prove ownership with 100% certainty, there's potential use cases outside of buying things.

sure but merchants don't charge less for cash, i still gain something by using a credit card.


but I've never paid interest and there's no penalty for that, I stillg et the same rewards.


It would be stupid for someone to get paid in something that they can spend at &lt;1% of the places near them or even in the world.


we are talking about payment methods, since there is no bitcoinVisa the comparison is valid.


Ok and? the majority of methods for buying bitcoin require a bank account.
no matter how you look at it it's easier to use the local fiat of your choice, it's effortless for me to spend CAD, everywhere in my country accepts it and there's entire existing platforms built on top of that. bitcoin not so much, and even if i had bitcoin there's a total of &lt;15 places i can spend Bitcoin in my city of &gt;1million.

The problem isn't even awareness it's that there's basically no benefits for the average person.
I can buy something with my credit card which gives 1-3% of my money spend back as rewards and doesn't even make me pay for 21 days, i can pay my entire bill by clicking a single button on my bans website. 
Or, I can buy Bitcoin, which requires work, then go buy something. that's straight up more difficult. most of my purchases these days are done by tapping my card and forgetting about it for a week or so until i pay my bill and i get paid for using my credit card.
the only people who are going to use bitcoin are either people who have bitcoin they don't want and/or evangelists who want to spread the word. These two groups account for a very tiny percentage of the total population.

The government owns the land and lets people live on the land as long as they follow the laws, the government does not consent to unlawful inhabitants and punishes them. the is a contract that is between the government and each individual, they can either comply, leave or be punished. the government is just a collective of individuals.

So let me get this straight, your entire idea of a libertarian society hinges on the fact that there are unspoken rules that no one enforces but must be followed or it's 'wrong', this is laughably naive and will never happen. The truth is that free markets evolve.


So by creating these policies they actually are controlling everyone...


most actions are not free and there's always coercion. If i sell food or medicine and people need to buy these things suddenly i have power, i can raise my prices this is a market action....


making a market free is the definition of a market action... the fact that a market is no longer controlled in any way is going to have immediate consequences.
The only way your idea of libertarianism could work is if the entire world had no corruption. which means never...
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:19:07
you can't call something an opinion because you disagree with it. 
it's not about the currency being worth more, it's about the value being predictable this is stability.
if you know something is going to be worth 10% less every year for the next 100 years and that's exactly how it behaves then everyone can act accordingly.
yes lets look at gold, in 1940 it was ~$600, in 1970 it was worth ~$300, by 1980 it was worth ~$1800 , in 2005 it was ~$400. this is the definition of not stable, how can you have an economy based on something where you don't know the value?
how does one create a predictable value when the entire market is decentralized?

barely, it took maybe 10 minutes to set up my bank account a decade ago, maybe another 10 the first time i got a credit card, if i ever wanted a new one for some reason i could call and that would be mailed to me in a couple days.

if you need to use coins to participate in a network then it doesn't matter what the coins are worth every single person or entity who uses the network has an interest in keeping it running.
imagine you needed some crypto to use the internet, the crypto itself has no value in dollars but is still extremely valuable. This type of usage is something that can be used to make smart networks where it costs tokens to use a limited resource(like electricity), entities can be assigned tokens on a schedule and then also barter for more in some use cases.
If you think dollars is the only type of value that exists you aren't seeing a huge amount of use cases for a trust-less token. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:39:57
no he isn't correct. Value isn't defined in dollars, if the cost of network participation was maintaining and using a blockchain then it has value.

It would be more like the washing machine wants to run but it doesn't have the tokens currently because i am watching TV and power is more expensive at peak time, so it waits until night time. Or perhaps i want to use the computer but it has no tokens so i go grab some from the TV since they both fall under entertainment. 
this isn't some sort of contract with my power company this is a way for a household to budget power usage with tokens and smart contracts.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:05:50

So how much does oxygen sell for? There's almost nothing that has a higher value to a human yet it's free here on earth.
if i made a private network that ran on a crypto to manage power usage it wouldn't matter if my "tokens" were worth nothing since machines need to use them to be allowed power, that gives the tokens value. However if you used the tokens outside my network they would be worthless.
