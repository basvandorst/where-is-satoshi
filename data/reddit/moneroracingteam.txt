Dear 22% of respondents, 
How do you sacrifice privacy for security when privacy is security?
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:37:37
Watching the blocksize debate; I don't think Bitcoin will ever be able to have anonymity features built into it at the code level which will always make it middling choice as a privacy coin. I think Satoshi knew that using ring signitures would have painted too large of a regulatory target on the first cryptocurrency and decided on a bitgold system rather than a Friedmanesque ecash model. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:16:02
Exactly the way I feel about Bitcoin supremacist. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:41:34
Recommending coinjoin when there are more unlinkable and untraceable and fungible solutions is sad. 
What bothers me that most people aren't aware that you can use services like Shapeshift and XMR.TO to convert XMR/BTC and have the anonymity of a ring-signiture coin with the buying options of Bitcoin.
Would these same people chose to trade $1,000 dollar bills for ones that may have been used in a bank robbery and are being tracked by the FBI?

Nicely said. I don't know why some Bitcoin supporters are threatened by the idea of other coins, but it comes off as imperialistic.
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:26:28
Bitcoin doesn't promote itself as anonymous, nor does anyone who understands it, claim that it is anonymous. It is pseudononymous, and if you do a bunch of research and follow best practices and make sure you do these every time, you can make it fairly anonymous, but still not as anonymous out of the box as a coin that uses ring signatures. So it can be made more anonymous, but it is usually time consuming and more expensive (mixers, trading for alts, ect) than just using it out of the box. If privacy is your thing and all efforts being equal, use a coin that was designed to be anonymous and you'll be more anonymous than the guy using a pseudononymous coin.
TLDR: A Humvee is a better all-terrain vehicle than a Lotus on a lift-kit.

Who said cash will always exist?
Your argument isn't an argument that bitcoin is fungible, it's an argument that cash is fungible and therefore Bitcoin will have to benefit from cash's fungibility--which isn't the case if exchanges of cash for bitcoins are mostly being monitored, and if you do illegal things (or are perceived to be) with bitcoins it will still be monitored by the blockchain whether the on-ramps and off-ramps are cash-based or sidechain-based or tumbler-based--this is why Bitcoin isn't fungible. 
And yes, cash is becoming less fungible each day, but that doesn't mean we should accept a clear blockchain with low fungibility as the solution when there are more fungible solutions available.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:56:40
I guess Satoshi is relatively afraid to spend his btc.
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:25:01
That's not true. You can't spin-off developers, which in the case of Monero, is the biggest edge it has over other opaque blockchain coins. 
Also, are spin-offs real yet? And again, will Monero have first mover advantage in the opaque blockchain market and enjoy spin-offs when they become available? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 07:14:28
You are assuming that if Monero is proved beyond a doubt to be anonymous, then Bitcoin will become Monero? Will that fit the agenda of those that want a public blockchain? Won't Monero already have a first mover advantage (coders, ecosystem, ect) if that day came? Someone will be quick to yell "sidechains!" but that implies the coders will be on equal footing and that a sidechain won't break the very anonymity that you're seeking--a point that is still being debated. 
A metaphor for clear and opaque blockchains:
There are limitations to a Lotus's chassis the same way there are limitations to a Humvee's chassis and this is why you don't see a race-inspired Lotus fording a river or a Humvee jockeying for position in a Formula One event.  
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:21:23
Spoken like a true Bitcoin Supremacist. Basically your argument is that since there's no need for a spinoff, so spinoffs don't exist. Let me spin another scenario for you: some people (myself included) want privacy now and won't wait for it to be incorporated into bitcoin, and by the time you figure that fact out, bitcoin will playing myspace to monero's facebook.
@_date: 2015-05-25 10:27:05
Too bad the watchers aren't invested in Bitcoin and will use opaque coins to hide their transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-25 09:33:48
Yeah, because the US-European  governments never apply pressure to other governments to follow KYC laws. And Russia and China are never heavy-handed when it comes to regulation, never. 
The idea that Bitcoin doesn't need companies, but needs people misses that Governments (US and others) may want your finances traceable and not give a flying fuck where they go as long as they KNOW where they go. Mixer? Tumblers? Who owns them? Even if they are secure, are they mixing the coins properly? Depending on a clear blockchain to do the work of an opaque blockchain sounds like investor rationalization, because why would anyone who needs or cares about privacy use an inferior solution to a problem that seems pretty damn fucking important?
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:55:44
Mixers... LOL

Let's not shill coins here and get off the subject. Dash's masternodes are a NSA wet-dream due to many of them being run on Amazon servers....
How will a sidechain of a privacy coin solve the fungibility issue? You'll still have coins that are easily identifiable by where they are coming from--a sidechain! This is no different than the fungibility problem with tumblers and mixers as the OP outlined. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:59:31
I am reading, just not agreeing.
The lead isn't any more insurmountable then Hillary Clintons lead going into the primary against Obama.
Not to mention that if there were such a compelling need for Bitcoin right now, I think the market cap would be a tad higher. (It's only big when it's compared to alts and it didn't have to compete with them to gain that share--monero does).
Proper mixing hasn't failed anyone that you know of--but that doesn't mean the FBI is tracking you and using the bockchain data to find a slip-up or moniter behavior to gather sufficient eveidence to put you away without revealing how sophisticated their blockchain analysis is--I'm going to use the best tech available while you can try making a clear blockchain into something it's not.
As Bitcoin pointed out the market cap can grow exponentially in a matter of days, so either the market is waiting for Bitcoin to do something major or they're waiting for the better tech--probably both.
@_date: 2015-05-19 05:42:17

And German leadership used this same argument to assume the Enigma machine hadn't been broken, and yet, the British were smart enough to make each successful counter attack look as if it had been launched by  means easily explainable by other factors than the Enigma machine being broken. 
I'm simply not trying to make a clear blockchain private when there is a perfectly good opaque blockchain available. This is the same logic automobile designers use when making an all-terrain vehicle by designing them from the ground-up to be off-road capable rather than modifying cars designed for paved roads for off-road use.

And if that mixer is logging IPs? Or the mixer is compromised? 
Mixers don't provide very good anonymity. Until agencies start monitoring/forcing-businesses-to-block joinmarket, shapeshift, and xmr.to are your best bets. And even then, you may be leaking IP information from TOR or I2p if you are not careful.

One Billionaire could raise Dogecoin to Bitcoin's network. What do you think one could do with a real digital cash that scales with the network's current demand?
Keep repeating the dogma, but don't pretend that that alone will bring mass adoption or prevent another coin from rising. 
And why are you so greedy? Why would another coin's success take that much away from Bitcoin's success?

Says the man person who is not letting it go by posting it again =P
I never said you were dumb, i just think you have the normal r/bitcoin bias. Even the Bitcoin developers aren't making any of the claims that you are. Monero and Bitcoin are fundamentally different and perform different functions--this doesn't make them competitors, so I don't understand the unnatural bias coming from the community.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:36:38
LOL, mixers and tumblers? Even if they aren't run by NSA/FBI/Mafia, they still don't fix fungibility. Joinmarket is really cool, but it doesn't save you from getting coins that may be linked *ad hoc as a tainted gateway. 
As Chaum pointed out, a true digital cash will be unlinkable, untracable and fungible--that's not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the birth of a new asset class and is great, but that doesn't mean we should accept it as digital cash when it doesn't meet all the criteria. 
A ring-signiture sidechain doesn't fix payment gateways and makes the process laborious and inefficient. If you follow the conversation on bitcointalk, even the sc developers can't adequately answer these concerns.
Here's a link to Gmaxwell's Monero address:
^ There's not a reason BTC can't be a better asset, public+immutable proof of ownership, and settlement apparatus, my only point is that I wouldn't use it the same way I use cash, nor do I think you can layer enough services on top of it to make it as useful as a cash without admitting you are playing a cat and mouse game with LE--a sometimes public and always immutable cat and mouse game. It's similar to trying to make a street car an off-road vehicle; sure you can do it, but the vehicle that was designed from concept to last iteration as an off-road vehicle will have the advantage. 
*Thank you for the correction.
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:17:10
An opaque blockchain is not a clear one and vice versa--good luck explaining that away. Think of this as a comparison between the internet and i2p.
BTC was at 91% if the market a few months back--it was at 82% as of a couple days ago, so it is actually losing market share based on the empirical facts.
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:03:19
You can't claim a network effect if they are two different networks (clear, opaque) or if mass adoption has yet to happen--either way, an assumption propagated by the most interested parties seems hardly a convincing or objective statement, but more of trying to game yourself as the inevitable outcome as Hillary did in the 08 primary. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:37:15
LOL. Taint is when andress is compromised validly or without merit--there only needs to be the suspicion of wrongdoing (as Coinbase has pointed out on numerous occasions). In the name of KYC and AML, businesses will eschew any and all BTC with the hint (or even the possibility) of wrongdoing.
 --As long as people like this exist, there is no way for a clear blockchain to remain fungible (at least not for very long), without resorting to off chain solutions that are clumsy and add the burden of time, cost, and risk. An opaque blockchain doesn't have these inherent risks, but you are more than welcome to play mouse to LEA and banking interest's cat--I'll be over here doing it the more proven and less costly way (time and money).
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:58:51
You're right. Joinmarket only has a fungibilty issue as the gateway can be flagged--my bad, still early for me.
It's tumblers and mixers that have issue with being compromised by bad links or malicious actors.
Also, did you read the link? I'd be interested on your thoughts on how the blockstream developers could fix the issues outlined.
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:59:23
No, you are falsely implying that I'm implying that. I'm implying that if you actually use the methods you defend, that your BTC will lose value or cost more to use (time and money to find a non-KYC/AML compliant) or potentially be linked to some criminal activity (not necessarily yours--IE. false positive). 
That's one way to fill in the blanks.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:16:56
XMR.TO is a private enterprise and a short-term solution to XMR purchasing power and Bitcoin privacy. Monero will still be fungible and private no matter what happens to XMR.TO or shapeshift or bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:43:52
That's a lie. Bitcoin isn't as fungible as Monero and I have no problem stating that fact. The whole Bitcoin is fungible enough or anonymous enough argument is the lie; it's not either for me, but you can use it and I don't really care how it affects your life now or later. I own BTC in the form of a 401k deductable asset and own Monero for purchasing with discretion. Don't assume you know my motives--my motive is to be right.

@_date: 2015-07-05 15:57:10
Repeat, "As long as you have an observable gateway, you will have a fungibility problem." Restated for simplicity: a clear blockchain will never be as fungible as an opaque one (one XMR=one XMR, but one BTC doesn't always = one BTC). As long as an analysis tool can  potentially separate or blacklist or ban certain BTC coming form a gateway, it is not as fungible as Monero.
And coinjoin with CT as a sidechain:
Now Coinjoin with a CT sidechain helps (the best solution offered) and is novel, but as dnaleor points out, you get stuck leaving them in the sidechain and the process is less than efficient and leads to use problems. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:15:17
The analysis software is going to keep getting better at making links and the blockchain isn't going to become less permanent with time, so I'll stick with not using BTC for anything I don't want associated to me now or later.

And joinmarket has a fungibility problem. Just because something hasn't broke, doesn't mean it wont. The fungibilty problem outlined by the Evolution/BTCe blockade, showed that the theoretical problem that me, Monero supporters and Bitcoiners (who want to see an opaque hardcode) were right in our concerns and it wasn't some blasphemous illusion baked-up by alt coin propagandists.
As long as you have an observable gateway, you have a fungibility weakness. (joinmarket)*
As long as you have centralization, you have a fail-point. (open transactions)*
The solutions you outlined are not adequate for me-- i want an opaque blockchain and don't care if it is Monero or Bitcoin, but it has to fit all three criteria; unlinkable, untraceable, and fungible. I will add decentralized, but i thought after the lesson of Napster, no one needed to be reminded of the importance of decentralized solutions.

So you KNOW that was Satoshi's thinking? Many have speculated that he didn't use a ring signiture system as it would have taken many more years to develop or that satoshi knew the powers that be would try to squash a true digital cash and a clear blockchain system would act as a Trojan horse and deliver the revolution he wanted. Adding it to a clear blockchain is bad design if you can add it to the core; it is much easier and efficient and secure to layer clear functions on a opaque blockchain than it is to do it vice versa.
Stating speculation as fact is intellectually disingenuous.

1. Monero is by default more anonymous and more fungible, so please outline the steps you are referring to so we can make an educated comparrison.
2. That's assuming LE doesn't have  the capability to use metadate collection techniques to make connections and that you are using best practices every time--either case XMR with BTC would provide greater privacy and make best practices easier to achieve. 
3. There's a viewkey that allows you to show interested agencies YOUR transactions if YOU decide that that is in YOUR best interest.
4. All alt coins are low liquidity at the moment, but on this day Monero/XMR has the 5th highest liquidity--it's almost like the cryptocurrency gods want to spite you for using a moving target.
