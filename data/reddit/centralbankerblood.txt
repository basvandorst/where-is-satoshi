Let's stick to facts and evidence please not subjective blabla
That zerohedge article had a good graph, that the author doesn't even consider to deal with
I've been watching closely, and if you did too you'd noticed the very tight connection between the CNY devaluation and the following Bitcoin rise. CNY has to devalue to keep exports going. Also China has stopped buying blindly into US bonds in August, which seems like a reaction to the decision of not being let into the SDR as a big reserve currency this year despite great anticipation.
The reasons for the CNY devaluation are manifold, but in a nutshell the economy is toast the eternal growth of the last 3 decades has finally come to an end, even the leadership speak of "soft landing" (read as hard landing). The higher ups and the top of the middle class realized this, the bubbles popped may it be real estate or stock markets as well as ordinary biz activity. This knowledge is trickling down slowly down the Chinese 100M middle class - and Chinese discuss money and strategy when the family gets together, one such occassion was the October Holidays, the next big gathering is Chinese New Year in February.
The capital controls btw were not only for international transfer also nationally the govt suddenly imposed 5000 CNY caps for the mobile payment systems! Also bank reserves were lowered and banks are given more flexibility to set interest rates. It's amazing how little even wannabe journalists and "economists" pay attention to this dead giveaway. If they'd be more investigative and inductive in method they'd collect the many puzzle pieces and put them together and see a consistent pattern.
This video offers a good overview on China's "soft landing"
skip the last minute of positive thinking bs
If you wonder why the govt is playing the trump card "2-child policy" it's to ease the masses for 2016 decline, keep them busy, create new debt slaves on paper and provide a massive conservative backlash instead of emancipated population with spending power seeking for political freedom after gaining financial independence.

for the nth time there is no nobel prize in economics, there is a prize by a bank given to vocal supporters of esoteric, yet mutally exclusive and contradicting ideas how to control the economy and market and in such a way to keep the poor poor and the rich rich via fiat pumping - supporters mind you that never created actual wealth for public good, parasites that were on the leash of the elites
