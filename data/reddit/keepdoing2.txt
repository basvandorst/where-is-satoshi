LOL - I like his little faces, especially this one....
And actually I didn't mention Barclays, but yes, this story is very very relevant to the general trend...

Bitcoin becomes digital gold, used as settlement. Circle is already doing it between British Pound and USD.  Circle = JPMorgan/Goldman Sachs.  IBM/Hyperledger is folding in Bitcoin.  Blockstream Code is a major underpinning of the new IBM Blockchain.  They are merging Bitcoin in.  It's happening quicker than anyone realizes.  Segwit is going to make this go even faster.  I believe all of this is going to happen.  Not saying I like it.  I think it is evil.  But I do think it will succeed.

Except to the owners of the SideChain.  They will be required, like Coinbase or your local bank, to acquire and retain ALL of your contact information to meet with Global Terror and Laundering laws.   Sidechains will simply be the new bank accounts.  So while the transactions may be private from the main chain, and government or law agency or court (think civil cases) will be able to access your COMPLETE records.  So lets not spin this "privacy" thing to far.

agree.  although I personally even called for it myself.  I think no one could foresee the eth devs having a complete capability meltdown, which is my opinion of what has happened here.  too many unforced errors.  you can't win a baseball game with unforced errors.  old wisdom.

It seems to me that the biggest legal threat isn't to Coinbase as much as it is to Ethereum.  Ethereum Foundation (and Vitalik directly I believe) have admitted that they new about the issue of the ETC &amp; ETH chains not being split properly - but felt a time constraint and went ahead with the Hard Fork anyway.  Look at the problems this continued sloppy coding as caused.
Coinbase is here rumoured to be hemorraging Customer Funds.  Yonbi and other exchanges have lost funds.  Individuals have lost funds.
**BAD &amp; HASTY CODING once again by Ethereum Developers is having widespread impacts across the Crypto world.**
When are people going to stop worshipping at the altar of Vitalik, and start holding someone accountable for the rushed and repeated HUGE mistakes they keep making. 
This is STUPID!  This is another reason to buy ETC.  Yes, a shameless plug, but also another reason ETC will eventually surpass ETH.  Ethereum Foundation is just a lawsuit waiting to happen, and I am not so sure this won't be the trigger.
Oh, and my guess is that about now Brian Armstrong is pretty pissed at Ethereum.  Just one problem after another.  A match made in hell.

I just did a writeup piece over on EthereumClassic that may be of interest to some.  It addresses some of the fears and fallacies of "Going to Zero" and 51% Attacks post fork.

I agree that question pissed me off.  BUT - on the other hand, I think it is a sign of what is to come as crypto grows.  It isn't just coinbase - it is all future exchanges.  The governments are starting to lean on them.  To Coinbase's credit - they don't make you prove the send as one way or another.
