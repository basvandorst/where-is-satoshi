Good find! I'm coding in another language but using this over the native package gets me 80&amp; speedup on my laptop. I'll have to port my code to something else to get anything more out of it.

IIRC, the address is derived from a hash of the public key derived from the private key and it's practically impossible to go back and derive the keys from the address.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:17:23
So there'll be more? :\)
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:54:52
That's a little disappointing. Some puzzles have taken years to solve and it'll be more interesting if it takes time.

Do anyone know anything OpenCL based for checking valid mnemonics against an address?
Edit: Yes, I have asked Google. I can only test about 500 of the valid mnemonics per second on my CPU so need something faster.

For one, the derivation path is different \(m/49/0/0/0/0 vs m/0/0\) but I believe it's assumed to be a BIP49 address.

Paste into the mnemonic field at [
Choose BIP49 and check the first address. If it matches the prize address, congratulations!

Guessing you're on a recent Intel chip?
Edit: I profiled my program and found most time is spent in the sha512 hash function for converting the mnemonic to a seed for generating the address. Given I can get about an 8th of the speed per core my guess is it's due to my Ryzen lacking the AVX512 instructions that modern Intel chips have, which are said to handle SHA512 about 8 times faster. My program is otherwise optimised as much as I can get it but I guess I'm not going to win a brute\-force race.
I've got my list down to about 13 pairs with some I'm more confident about than others but I'll have to work on this some more.

An existing function to test the checksum isn't hard to find for most widely used languages but it's still impractical to test the resulting very large list for the correct address. Or do you have some other way to filter the list of valid mnemonics?
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:47:44
Would a word not in the whitepaper be significant?
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:08:28
Any of the words could be the checksum so we still have to come up with all the words to create a valid mnemonic.

There was also the 20020801 but someone has already been down that road.

Roger, is that you?

I guess that's what you call an anti-climax?

Thanks. I was going to point out she actually pays a lot of tax but I couldn't remember how much.
That said, she's getting some of it back in the form of renovations on her house.

How is the performance? I've been considering a similar setup myself. Which version of RPi is that (1, 2, 3, zero)?

I remember a school friend ranting about MD and tell me how it was the future of music storage. I went a different route and bought a neat little MP3 player with 32MB of storage that one of the teachers was selling. It even had an expansion slot for a SmartMedia card ( It seemed more practical by comparison so I never expected MD to win that fight.
BTW, the price on the packaging for my actual 32MB SM card (not the one in photo) is £43.99. That would've been around 2002 at a guess.

Looks like you got another chance! Did you buy?

You've prompted me to try generating Segwit addresses in a project but I've noticed the Segwit addresses are not associated with the account that the original address is linked to. I guess it's the same problem as generating change addresses.
Can anyone confirm this?
