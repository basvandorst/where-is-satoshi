If you can't donate, it's not by force, but don't just open up and say shit to anybody, everybody on the Internet isn't a fraudster, get that right!

Begging is better than hacking right?

That won't help the course either, imagine nobody told you about bitcoin, how will you feel if you find out about it like 2 years from now, you will feel pained right? That's why I decided to start a course to help more people know about the online gold

Basically the course is going to be video-based, with some period webinar and everything you need to know about bitcoin
I have 3 years experience dealing with bitcoin

This conversation would have made sense if I was begging you for the bitcoin but I don't think so, I was only begging someone that has enough to spare not you, you don't seem to have nothing either

Don't talk about what you don't know, OK? 
I will contact you and mock you once I start the course, all you are saying are just your opinion, it doesn't stop the fact that I will start the course soon, everybody deserves to know about this gold rush

Nothing bad in asking for someone help, even animals help each other, but human are 'fantastic' afterall
All of you giving downvotes should go get a life, I didn't ask you for bitcoin, I only asked the person that posed the update
I need to enjoy this trading thing too, we can all make it
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:20:46
Exactly, just get by this and say no more, I don't need opinion, I only need bitcoins
I don't understand why peeps are stating their opinion when all I asked for is bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:55
We can all make it if we help sometimes

You think so? Maybe you should be my first student
If I spend my bitcoin for the course, it won't be free, that's why I'm trying to raise fund to make it free, ok?
