I should have just googled it.  Looks like [Coinbase is.](

Are there any exchanges that are insured against losses like this?  Seems like a terrible idea to put your BTC into any exchange not insured.

My friend runs a non profit called [Semper k9]( that takes rescue dogs and donated dogs and trains them to be service dogs for returning vets. They train them for psychiatric alert and for mobility challenged vets. Their financials can be [found here]( They are small, so a donation to them could be life changing for the vets they support.

Just 0.6 BTC away from replacing my broken TV!  I don't think my Antminer U1 will make it anytime soon...

Can you ELI5?  I don't understand the connection, even after reading the article.  What kind of response is it providing?

Maybe you're right, is it legal to sell your hand to another person?  If so, then your bet does have equity.

Can you rescind a bet in Vegas?  If not, then you have absolutely no equity, you have given your money to the casino and are waiting to see if they will give you any back.  Now, if we're talking chips that you physically possess, then sure, you have equity.  But there is no equity in a bet.

This is the closet thing I can find to this supposed quote...
[“Bitcoin is mathematical. There is a finite amount. It is like a house. If you buy a house today and sell it, it is a house today and a house tomorrow. You may think it has gone up in value, but it’s still a house.
“The government just says it has gone up in price so they can tax half of it, or all of it,” he joked.](

I think the problem with your argument is that you assume $1 of gold is always the same weight. This is not true, even when the world used the gold standard, inflation still existed. Your argument needs to be that 1 oz of gold will always be 1 oz of gold, it won't deteriorate. The value may increase or decrease as gold supplies increase or decrease.

Flax (linen) is literally an invasive plant that can easily and successfully invade a forest.

You're referring specifically to the "gold specie standard", which requires circulating gold coins. There are 2 other gold standards which do not require gold coins to be circulated, "gold bullion standard" and "gold exchange standard".

Why is the twitter handle in the window different than the one you just linked to???  The one in the window is for a cafe in New Jersey.
