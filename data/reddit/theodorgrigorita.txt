HODLing is relatively rational now for those who bought at 300-1000 USD :)
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:07:09
I boight high. When enterted the market. Sold higher and took the profits. Now buying back more to get into the market for new highs :) I expect it got back to at least 20k according to all my calculations. But optimistically. Few days we see price growth. And everybody wanting a piece of cake in bitcoin will pump the price to new highs. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:19:20
Let's hope we don't see sell walls and get some consistent growth
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:08:15
I think someone really want to get his hand on lots of bitcoin. That's why we see all of this happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:10:13
Nothing is constantly going up. If BTC will decide to make downturn I will take my profits. And I'd recommend everyone to be aware of it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:27:01
A bit early to say but mostly agree
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:43:38
This is the kind of news we are looking for :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:00:53
Can't wait for another Bitcoin 100%+ gains. Which without doubt we'll see in upcoming 45 days.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:27:57
It does. Setting up for new Highs
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:25:53
I think someone is trying to push BTC price down this way in order to get some at a lower price. After which we should be expecting at least some 50% growth next 30 days.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:04:40
That's a lot of "stupid money" coming into market... but why the market is slow ? Anybody knows what's happening ? My guess is someone is willingly pushing the market down in order to achieve more BTC and this can be observed by HUGE SELL WALLS on different exchanges. Noticed on CEX and Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:24:30
 Base line is the line of support on weekly chart for BTCUSD. It's repetitive and it is strong
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:44:38
I am not thinking it will go that low... but if it will, I will get some more BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:55:39
They  do have periodically some problems.... This december they had some issues that got solved... and that was when I started registering on other exchanges like Bitfinex
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:05:10
no .... I bought because of FOMO at 10K... got out of the market at 16.5k
What I am saying is that most of newcomers do that... That was a mistake what I have done at that moment and I would never repeat that ever again. i.e I would not buy right now any of the altoins because of them being ATH.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:30:56
Best way to analyze the market are Chart indicators... If you want to trade that , get some lessons online, learn how to read the chart and where it is probably going.
As for now I am bullish on bitcoin. And few days we might see all the money people made on altcoin pump into BTC as soon as someone will pull the trigger to push the market up.
I recommend to use Ichimoku cloud, RSI , MACD. Main indicator is Ichimoku confirmed by RSI. MACD is used as another confirmation but usually it is faster the the other 2 indicators.
If you got in at around 2k. I wouldn't bother selling it right now. And BTC is maintaining it's Dominance for a very long period abode 32% which is a sign that it is a strong Crypto no matter where the market goes.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:48:02
I understand that.. but where is the money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:36:35
Much. Less. As much as invested. Not sure what to do with such amount. OMG should have sold it a long time ago. Nice, at least got as much as invested.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:01:11
Uite tot aici in post cineva mia raspuns despre ceea ce a gasit cu linkuri indicate despre ichimoku. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:20:08
Never gonna happen. I guess it might climb back to 50% range and that will be a lot... and beside the 50% range the market cap will increase which will make bitcoin cost over 25k 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:22:44
I didn't buy at 20k. And I made mistakes that I had only to learn from.
Not going to repeat them for sure. 
Now I bought some bitcoin and waiting for it to rise. And going to sell if it goes below a certain price.

Keiser report is one of the best tv shows. And that explains a lot of what's really happening in the Crypto Market
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:33:37
Or new lows :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:50:14
Everyone wanting to trade anything anytime. Learn about Ichimoku Cloud indicator, backtest it and find strategies using this indicator. It has proven worthy to stay on my chart. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:02:13
What about adoption ?  If BTC will not be adopted you think its price still gonna go up ?  Just saying. Major news can influence. Regulations etc.  Thinking its gonna go up forever is a utopia. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:54:09
Right now got only BTC decent amount bought at 15.6k on cex.
Got nothing else for the moment. Waiting now for BTC to rise after that will take some profits and invest in altcoins like ETH and some other decent coins.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:33:02
BITCOIN, now that you have our attention , Pay your taxes to the government
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:02:43
It  is gambling if you are gambling. But, you are trading if you technically analyze the market. Invest time in understanding the way things work. Why one went up while other goes down and the other one is holding position. an example would be Altcoins&gt;ETH&gt;BTC for the moment.
Myself not a trader, but investing time into learning some tools to get into market.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:43:42
What kind of FIAT currency is that ? Everybody is into crypto nowadays.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:08:25
Check youtube vids. They are usually over 1 hour long. Take your time learning.  And don't rush thinking you know the tool and the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:14:44
right now $14,000x1000BTC can't be unseen
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:19:27
I doubt there will be even 9k... 10k possibly. but no less IMO
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:29:47
Callisto is next stop. Who's with me ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:06:42
I agree with all you said and noticed same things happening.
My guess is WEALTHY are pushing the price down to get into the market at a "fair price". 
I am more than sure that during Q1 we gonna see new highs. 
I made a post about COINMARKETCAP.COM that they have the possibility to influence the price of the market only by deviating from the AVG price by 0.5-1% lower or higher. (Most of readers disagreed or suggested to use another website) Why I did a post about it is the fact that they already did this by excluding Korean Exchanges which resulted the market to sell. And my guess is they are still pushing it lower.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:31:31
I will message you :)
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:44:45
Try Hodling when you buy at 20k and see it falling down to about 11k. It can give a heart attack :). But if bought at current price HODLing won't be so stressful :)
