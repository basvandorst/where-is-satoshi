It's primarily a medium of exchange and a store of value in the short term. For long term store of value you use bonds, real estate, stocks, etc.

You can do the same with dollars and euros with the added benefit of low probability of losing 50% of your purchasing power overnight.

Yes but you can surely agree that the risk of all people suddenly deciding "fuck houses, we are all nomads now" is fairly low. You cannot say the same for bitcoin as its value is inherently tied to people willing to buy it.

Well home actually has an inherent value.  You can live in it or rent it out to people to generate cash flow. What cash flow can bitcoin generate?

Nobody is going to start a nuclear war for Latvia or Estonia. Putin will roll his tanks in, the US and EU, embroiled in their own internal chaos, will issue sanctions and maybe send some arms. NATO and US will be shown to the world as a toothless paper tiger. Japan and South Korea, seeing US impotence, will seek their own nukes and new allies, if they haven't started yet. 
Russia may offer Japan a new alliance and  kuril islands in exchange for kicking out US bases from its territory.

The role of currency is to be a medium of exchange not an investment. An ideal currency should neither lose nor gain value and since that is impossible, small rate of inflation is preferable to deflation.

Dave Rubin is a dumbbell. If you need evidence, listen to him on Joe Rogan arguing against building codes and other such gems

Yup. That's essentially a bank run and won't be good for anyone. I can't help but suspect that there may be some Russian instigation at play here.

There are surely legitimate complaints to be made about our financial system but a bank run ain't gonna solve any of  them.
Here I'm talking specifically of trying to create a bank run that would weaken the EU and limit its ability to respond to an invasion of one of the NATO members in the Baltics.
