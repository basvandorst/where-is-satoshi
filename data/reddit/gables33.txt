Serious question: what is the minimum feasible amount to "invest" in Bitcoin for a beginner?  If I was only willing to lose $100, how much of it would make it through paying fees/buying flash drives/setting up a wallet?

Not being a smartass: if you are buying goods and services with crypto, do you agree to a crypto price or a fiat price w/conversion?  When you have times of high usage like December, how do you navigate high fees/slow processing times?  Are you only exchanging crypto with people you trust, or with strangers?

It doesn't take a big part of your life to learn, "Put money into a Vanguard Target Date Fund every month automatically, then wait until you retire to take it out."  That technique may or may not be the best when viewed over a large time scale, but for 99% of investors it's going to be pretty darn good, and will almost certainly be better than not investing at all.

It's got "block" in the name, it has to be better for storing Bitcoin.

I got my Gmail account when it was still invitation only, and that turned out OK.

Sorry kid, your parents shouldn't have had you 12 years ago.  Guess you'll just starve.


Yep, it's a bummer when we make sure kids have food to eat.

But what if you regularly socially drink?

This is what really confuses me.  At this particular moment, is there anyone who is better off using bitcoin (or any other crypto) instead of fiat for any transaction?  Perhaps if you already have BTC and want to conduct a transaction that shouldn't be routed through the traditional banking system?

Currently the plan only calls for $200 billion in federal spending (the rest will be from state, local, and private funds), and it will supposedly be funded by cuts to other programs.  We'll see what happens if/when it makes it through Congress, but massive infrastructure spending won't be a priority for most Republicans.

Is it feasible to buy 10 bucks worth of Bitcoin?

Right... but those trades are all backed by the trust that whoever physically holds the wheat will actually honor the contract when the time comes.
