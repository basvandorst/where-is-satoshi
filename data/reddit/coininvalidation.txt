Same with a gift card.  Some people get offended by that and cash as gifts.  You can't please everyone and sometimes you'll waste money on them, it's life unfortunately.

Your coins have just been invalidated.
Fuck you.

Especially if you're a regular and, i assume, usually tip.  They'd think you just forgot and probably wouldn't want to accidentally run off a regular customer by attacking them in this manner.

Think of it this way: That bitcoin wallet (assuming it has money on it) can be spent on any number of stores that take bitcoin and some stores that take bitcoin for gift cards to even MORE stores.  So in a sense it is like a MasterGift Card.  And I don't see people complaining about receiving a regular gift card that only works at ONE place.

And I'm just a lowly Coin Invalidator.  Perhaps we can join up to cause confusion and division within the community.  We could do these things even better than those "Other Guys".

I would give it back.

I was using the FBI as an example of how seriously you can take a conspiracy.  I use this because I was thinking of Ross Ulbricht's charges.

Soooo they essentially committed a conspiracy to breach the user agreement?  According to the FBI, conspiracy is almost as bad as following through.
