Still 100% no reason at all to go the alt-coin route vs. Bitcoin. Just makes you seem like shills in a pump and dump scam. I'm gonna guess someone behind the scenes is 'helping' you (and will make sure to dump enough coin to get rich INSTANTLY when the coin is released). 
Too bad, could have been fun. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:37:35
With the amount of alt-coins approaching critical mass (100+ who the hell thinks that 'Kitteh' has any real world value?) it's just a matter of time before they start the slow decline towards zero.

Unfortunately for shareholders the 8x value increase in Bitcoin means that the fiat valuation of ASICMINER is quite high at 0.6 BTC/share with drastically falling profits (compare to 5 BTC per share @ BTC value of $90-$110)
ASICMINER is a potentially fantastic company, but at a valuation around $160 million and (until Gen 3) low sales and profit they have a lot to prove and little room in share price to do it. 
Even with Gen 3 'in route' I would like to see share price around 0.15-0.20 to see it as a really solid investment right now.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:17:03

@_date: 2014-02-03 22:35:40
I don't really consider it either. The developers have plenty of incentive to pump the value in any way they can as they no doubt sit on a fair share of the total coin supply. Burning a few thousand BTC does not by any means mean its not a scam.

I would argue that long contract cloud mining is clearly not a scam if the contract terms are clear.

Yeah. I owned some ASICMINER from 1-&gt;4 BTC and it was a great investment both from a dividend view and in share value increase but that was in a world where they were literally 75% of ASIC sales and mining at 10%+ of the network speed. 
Even with a very successful ASIC launch and rebooting their mining operation I very seriously doubt that ASICMINER will ever get back to the golden days of ASICMINER. At current share price, far too much expectations is already priced in for my taste.

I guess I just don't see any value base to support 150+ million valuation purely based on possible future income. It was different when they were mining as a large part of the network, now they are just a small mining operation with a few 5k BTC as development funds to carry the entire valuation. They also have massive competition from other ASIC developers.

Kind of dickish to use technology developed by someone else and then publicly ridicule their work. Stay classy XCP..

First off. Moving is not the same as cashing out. And secondly, you can sell 3000 BTC on several of the open exchanges as well as privately without moving price at all.

Well obviously I am not saying buy hardware from either. Keep up.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:57:20
Not only is it on chip-level but going with 40nm they have also pin-holed themselves somewhat since a LOT of chips are going to have to be mounted on each PCB for a high performance miner. 
Interesting though and it's always good with competition in the space. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 03:06:24
Does not matter. Consumer law protects the customer in the territory the product is sold. As a US customer, making consumer rights claims outside of the US is almost 100% dead end.
Try suing the manufacturer of a US reseller item. And good luck.
You may or may also not be aware that EU law classifies Bitcoin mining hardware as 'non commercial products' meaning you have almost no consumer protection.

Pretty clear difference between being 'involved in Bitcoin' and simply being a greedy copy-paste programmer that makes alt-coins for pump and dump schemes though.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:20:10
People that have the view that they 'invest' in new exciting projects based on them quadrupling their investment in a pump and dump should just create their own copy-coins. I think most people that supported Ethereum did so because they find the proposition and team exciting, I know I did.

Part of why they are taking in cash (they are profitable or close to) is so that they are able to hold more BTC and not have to liquidate. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:50:37
Not telling anyone to buy mining contracts at all. Just saying, it USED to be 100% stupid, but with difficulty plateauing there is a case to be made for some of the cheaper options maybe reaching ROI.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:24:25
For all intents and purposes 90% of all alt-coins are just re-branded packages of the same code as Bitcoin/Litecoin/Primecoin.

Huge profit margins... That's a guy who has never mined..
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:55:41
This is just a dumb statement. Of course there is money to be made mining, or no one would do it. If you have cheap power there are plenty of ASIC currently available that can make you money.

Well thats odd. I have a friend who got an RMA in a fairly reasonable time. Have you tried sending them the data from the advanced tab of the miner? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:47:18
You have to be a complete idiot to believe that the explanation given by 'OP'. Malability would not cause transactions to automatically be re-sent and any solution that would allow that has to be coded intentionally for that action.

Dogecoin.. So many people see this as a 'funny concept' or 'joke that became serious' while the truth is that it was and is a scam to begin with. This entire 'joke' thing hides the fact that the founders and early adopters are using it to extract maximum profit from the Bitcoin community.

How would a bank specifically do this? With FDIC insurance its also not needed with checking/savings accounts. I was talking about other financial businesses. Unfortunately we have way too long ago accepted fractional reserve banking for Banks.

No they dont. Scrypt ASIC is out and CPU coins are just botnet-heaven.

Exactly my point, any exchange should be able to pay out 100% of customer funds at any point in time. Anything else is a failed business. As a matter of fact, a fair oversight of any financial institution should be one day a year, they withdraw ALL funds to customer accounts for just say an hour to prove solvency.

Best I can do is about $50 a coin. They are probably in pretty rough shape if you mined them way back in 2011. Then of course I have to frame them, and who knows how long it will take to resell them, not too many people interested in Bitcoin these days.

MtGox has NO bank contacts to transfer funds directly to US banks. Basically they transfer the money out to some random European bank and then into the US from there. Oh and unless you are looking at $1 million+ they just WILL NOT process your request (they have bigger fish to fry).
