Wrong. He IS hodling, for the wrong reasons admittedly but technically still hodling.

Is this announcement confirmed as real?

Just halariuos the recap of his speaking is like this "Come on guys, we invented the banking system and USD-currency for you... we like the because we can contr... monitore it. Why won't you stop using these drugdealer-terrorist kind of thingies, we don't understand or have sufficient matters of contr... monitoring. Every body I asked agrees it's a bad thing so won't you stop using them. It's for drug dealers only! Terrorism... drug dealers... Terrorism. TERRRTORRRISM! Thanks, these were my arguments. Never mind your answers, I already have my fixed mindset."

Sorry for miss-accusation (if it was one) it is just that answers like "here use this web-tool for seed-word-retrival" without a word of warning by default raise a red flag for me! Ppl who come here for advise and don't know much about programming can be scammed all to easily...
I admit that I did not review the site you quoted.

From a philisophical point of view I disagree. Once humanity does no longer exist, no one knows the value anymore and it will be 0!
So there will DEFFINITLY be a point in time where is goes to 0. Just be careful when using a superlative like "never" those statements back fire pretty quick ;-)
Also are you sure that every Currency survives time long enough for your statement to be true? I would argue the there have been early tribes which used shells as currency and nobody knows about it anymore. To guess that out modern computers and the Internet will last FOREVER is a hard claim which I would doubt to be true!

Just asume both scenarios might be possible and try the following in this order:
1. Try recomputing the last word based on the other seed words according to BIP39-spec and look if it unlocks your funds (best possible outcome)
2. If you know which word number you are missing, you can try all the 2048 possible solutions (will take roughly 100ms)
3. If you DON'T KNOW the position of the missing word nor the order of the remaining other words, you will have to try the 2048 possible "missing words" in all possible permutations which will be 2048 * 12! possibilities (I guess, would take quite a while to compute).
3.5 If you have some knowledge of the order of your words, you will end up somewhere between 2 and 3 but will likely be forced to calculate everything like in scenario 3

Red flag alert! High possibility of scam that only wants to steal your funds! Might be legit but only if you can review the uncompiled code and if you can do this, you might as well just write it yourselve. If neither of both is possible: DON'T USE IT!

Good code, not malicious for all I can say. However I think you can do even better for automated checking even when staying offline. It is a little depending on how the HD-Wallet is implemented, usually the seed words are calculated something like this: get a bunch of 0s and 1s (from your PRNG) which are your entropy-input (the words are just another way to display them, just like binary =&gt; hex you can do binary =&gt; words) feed the entropy-input through a hashing algorithm like SHA256, keep only the first x bits of the hash-output and interprete them as the last word (with 24 seed-words I think it is the last 3 words which are generated in this way). This procedure ensures that you have some check-sum-procedure which will check the correctness of your input. You can use this in a way like this: asume the missing word is in the position x (obviously use a loop for that), asume a word (another loop) then calculate the last check-sum-word for this set of words and see whether it matches the last word you have in your word-search-list. This way you need to check only one or some seed word combinations manually that satisfy this criteria ��

That is exactly the time I want to start playing around with it ;-)

Funny where people "see" Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:39:40
I hope that it is self-explanatory that you should move your funds to a new wallet if you found it. Purely for safety reasons as an additional measure... you will have done a lot of brute-force searching with your seed words all over your machines memory for quite a while... Also you already told people that you are about to search for the seeds and you probably can be identified via IP-adress for any hacker to mess with your PC or device. Just be extra careful!

Seems there still is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in the general public that does not yet understand crypto-currencies.
Maybe we need even more Andreas Antonopolusses for the world. I myself try to be one and started a educational lecture-serries for my co-workers on the technical design of crypto-currencies with Bitcoin as a starting point (all the way down to SHA256 and ECDSA with Secp256k1 and how a gossip-protocol works). They liked it and asked smart questions about the system already in the first lecture-serries.

Sure it might work technically but the transmission lines have already been built. So the cost for that have already occurred. These "old" wind turbines have been in normal commercial use before. Today they're ratio of upkeep for maintenance ect. compared to the revenues you can get from the still dropping power prices is a lossy business model. You can keep operating them if you pay yourselves a price per kWh of roughly 15 C. Though keep in mind that these turbines usually only have about 1000h/year of equivalent full load hours...
After crunching some numbers, to me it still appears to be a lossy business model. Though ecological justified ;-)

Rather the oposite is true, see 
It is a pretty stupid idea to use BTC for shady business as everything is publicly recorded. BTC is not anonym but pseudonym, if you can associate the BTC-adresses with a person you can almost instantly see all his prior money movement and who he had contact with. Modern data analytics and forensics make that quite easy... that's a bad characteristics if you want to use it for drugs and terrorism.

The last word usually is composed by a checksum of all of the first words, just read the algorithms specs. If it is the last word, you are missing, you can just recalculate it by applying the algorithm.
If it is one of the leading ones, you can check it against the last check-sum-word by trying all 2048 possibilities which will roughly take about 100ms with a simple python script.
Warning: do all of this with an offline machine and don't expose any of your seed-words to ppl on the web!!

Schön, dass die deutschen Ingenieure so hilfsbereit sind ;-)

I am a huge BTC fan but OFCOURSE will Bitcoin be down to 0 one day. Latest if humanity got extinct but probably earlier. Be careful when using superlatives ��
Also I have to admit to all the advocates of gold that there is a high probably that gold will out-last Bitcoin and be more valuable in the (verry) long run (talking 500+ years)
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:03:49
Still: how to put a value on a non-physical abstract concept (BTC) if nobody knows about it anymore (extinction scenario)? The value would be 0 then.

Heard a guy in Germany with the same plan: use old wind turbines with little power to do BTC mining to give a second live to the wind turbine instead of shutting them down due to low energy market prices. 
Still not sure if this plan really works... It is a great thing to "save" old wind turbines for ecologic reasons but from an economic point of view it seems just folly since you can get the energy much cheaper...

Very good advise! I agree to 100%.
