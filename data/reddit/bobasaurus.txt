We just need a new ebay that accepts bitcoin.

Thanks for your work on something I use every day.  I'll have to read through the code someday and see if I can contribute.

I love free firewood posts, as I can do green wood turnings on my lathe.  It turns like butter when the wood is green, so much fun... just have to carefully dry and final-turn the piece a few months later.

I've been following this subreddit for a few days, and now my interest is piqued.  I do a lot of hobby woodworking and some knife making, and I've been considering selling some small items for BTC.  I wonder if there would be any interest in wooden bottle openers, cutting boards, small boxes, baby rattles, pocket knifes, wine stands, and the like.  I also make unusual wooden things like disc golf discs, bicycle bar end caps, and computer cases.  It would be much easier to accept BTC directly than deal with the quagmire of Paypal.

Seems as good a time as any to try out tipping.  Good luck.

This is very depressing.  I use KeePass regularly and that seemed like a solid backup plan... gotta press the save button.  Maybe look into the keepass source for how passwords are seeded.  It's usually based on time, so you could potentially re-seed passwords over a range of times and try each one.

Don't have a site for it yet (and definitely no physical shop... I'm just a guy making stuff in my garage), but I could create one easily enough.  The auction sites are a good idea too... didn't know they existed.

This is the set I made for my bike out of mahogany:  
People seem to like these.  I think I would make future ones with an overly-small plug diameter, then include some bar tape to wrap around, making them adjustable to the right fit.
