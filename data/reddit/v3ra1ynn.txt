I'm sorry that happened..really.  Truthfully, no matter what subreddit your in, it seems there's always kids that tend to be shit stains on society.

I believe it, I'm just curious as to when this was?

What most people don't know is that Uber complies with all the laws and regulation in New York, and Lyft wasn't at all when they opened in August, and still aren't really.  Uber requires all of its drivers to have a TLC license as well as TLC insurance.  Regardless of what you may think, this actually does protect both the driver and the passenger/s. 
 One of the main reasons I didn't end up driving for Lyft is that if as a driver you get into an accident and its your fault, you're screwed and will be paying for it all out of pocket.  They do have insurance that is supposed to cover drivers and passengers, but its deceiving.  Before they will cover your claim, you have to submit a claim to your own insurance company, and if you're driving for Lyft, you aren't required to have TLC insurance, meaning that you're driving under your own personal insurance and in most if not all scenarios, your personal insurance company probably doesn't know what you're doing and if they did know you would be kicked off your policy.  So they say that if your insurance company denies your claim, they will cover it, but what they don't tell you is that if you actually try to file a claim with your personal insurance, you're going to get kicked off it, leaving you insuranceless and unable to continue as a driver.  So yeah, you get that claim paid by Lyft afterwards, but then you also don't have a job anymore.
I honestly don't even know why Lawsky is being pinned as the bad guy in this scenario, he was doing his job.  Would you run a stop sign in front of a Police Officer and expect not to get pulled over? Being a professional driver/chauffeur in NYC, I've been following Uber and Lyft for quite some time and I was really surprised that, even after having Uber as a model, Lyft came in completely disregarding *all* law and regulation in New York.  I think someone just forgot to do all of their homework.

What are your thoughts on alt-coins role in the digital currency world? As a strong supporter of both Bitcoin and Litecoin, I find it hard to believe that Bitcoin will be the only prevailing Digital Currency in the future if it continues to grow and succeed.

I don't quite understand the logic in that brother, but okay.  So maybe if there was just 1 type of fiat it would be worth more, but that doesn't mean it's better to just have one.

Not siding with OP but even this is a little misleading out of context. Here's the quote in its entirety:
“Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous. You know they’re willing to be known so **the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or** you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.“

You didn't directly ask for donations, but you have to realize that the way you setup your post is how a lot of cons are setup, not directly asking for money but still putting a viable method of receiving donations out there.  The article you posted above is a good start though for proof, I'm much more willing to believe now.
One huge mistake you did make was keeping your coins online.  Even though Coinbase is a well reputable/high security company, when dealing with coins online through a browser, your risk is much higher than if you were dealing with coins using an encrypted QT wallet.  I think a lot of other users have already posted that if you are going to use online wallets, 2FA is an absolute minimum requirement on all methods that are involved(your wallet, and email).

Ditto, a tidbit disappointed in Coinbase right now and I don't understand why they don't just release their own again, why wouldn't they? I wish they'd at least comment on it a little more extensively.

Ah, I thought he meant so no one could clone the firmware and use it on one of their own devices.  I completely get that they need to pay for R&amp;D still and that it in itself was way more costly than the hardware.  That was my misunderstanding, but I think they would make the $ back quicker if it was cheaper, more people would buy.  If it was $60 I would buy one in a heartbeat and I'm willing to bet that goes for a lot of other people as well.

As a strong supporter of Bitcoin, Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin, the amount of division and one way thinking, on all sides, baffles me.  I do everything I can to contribute to the economy of all of them, partake in charities, purchase goods/services at every opportunity, mine, and stay active in the community and each of them have their own merits that I can only see as helping with adoption.  It seems a lot of people here think that if you're into Litecoin that's all you're into, but a lot of people that have Litecoin or Dogecoin or whatever else have Bitcoin too and are just as into it and believe in the crypto/blockchain technology and only want it to prosper.  I don't see the sense in hating on one crypto or another, there are a vocal few in every crypto community that do it and it does absolutely nothing to help your coin, if anything it just hurts it.  Unless you have a crystal ball there at home(and if you do, I want proof), give it a rest, would ya?
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:55:23
Why have you, and many other companies(Zeus), decided to stop distributing newer/updated mining hardware and focus strictly on cloud hashing? Doesn't this detract from what Bitcoin stands for, decentralization? 
You guys were one of the biggest sha-256/scrypt hardware distributors(and Zeus one of the biggest manufacturers for scrypt) in the industry for a while and you made a significant amount of money doing so, very well could have been millions.  This, perhaps,  is where a lot of your Paycoin/Paybase funding came from.

So where can we catch this deal? I would buy one in a heartbeat if they were under $50 even. $119 though, just can't afford that right now.
PS: I would NEVER buy a BWallet or ANY clone for that matter.  Would rather just wait for the price drop on the Trezor.

I used to hang and help out people there all the time, one day I got banned for posting something completely related to Bitcoin from without any warning whatsoever.  Banned.

Okay you asked!  Personally when I first learned about Bitcoin I wanted to get into mining, looking in depth into mining I found out that it was actually more profitable to mine LTC, even if you were just going to convert it into BTC.  I fell in love with both but LTC as well because the community was so welcoming and eager to teach me the ways of mining(not saying BTC community wasn't).  I don't mine anymore as in NYC electric is just too damn high but I came to like the creator of it who seems to be a stable, honest and genuine person who's extremely active in the crypto industry with great credentials and it has arguably the second most stable network/infrastructure.  It has things it needs to continue to improve upon just like Bitcoin but being a believer that there will never just be one crypto currency, even though no doubt that Bitcoin is King and creator, I don't see why Litecoin won't keep its place and continue to grow as well.  Additionally it has shorter blocks which leads to quicker transactions, which regardless what anyone says and whether or not this will serve a legitimate purpose in the future, to me right now it does(for example I don't wait nearly as long for a deposit to go through on BTC-e).  Tried keeping that short but I think that covers a couple of the biggest reasons.

@_date: 2015-02-20 21:55:11
This article's  main points aren't at all accurate..


If anything robbing someone in person of their Bitcoin leaves way more evidence than doing so online, especially in NYC with how many people and surveillance cameras there are.  Investigation wise this scenario is no different then if it was cash involved and not Bitcoin.


Yes, using an analogy with something that's illegal is completely appropriate here, because you know, Bitcoin is illegal...right?


This statement is true, in regards to a year ago..maybe.  An online US regulated exchange seems way more secure to me than meeting someone random in NYC that you don't know.  If you don't want to go 'centralized', stick with BitcoinLocal, but I'm pretty sure way more people do so using the online routes rather than actually meeting up with someone.  That's how I started out anyway, I sure as hell wasn't trying to meet up with anyone(I'm in NYC).
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:03:44
I figured that this could surely be the case, was just trying to be conservative as my knowledge of cash tracking capabilities(with serials) is non existent.

Not exactly, Tenebrix was indeed first, but it was pre-mined big time by its maker Lolcust(7.7 million coins).  Fairbrix was created in part by the very developers that created Litecoin in order to create something that was not pre-mined.
Also, Tenebrix and Fairbrix were anti GPU, Litecoin was not anti GPU.
