OK. This did clear some doubts about the paper wallet. But, for example, the online service where I buy bitcoins, has my verified personal information. So they know of every transaction I do with them. Can I use the same address with them without extra privacy security issues?

Thanks. I'm starting to understand slowly.

Not at all. I personally know someone who already invested several thousands of Euros in one of their plans. And he is not computer savvy at all although he can handle a computer. And all he knew before he invested is that a friend told him that he has earned money from that same cloud mining company. Since it takes 1000 days to take 50% of your original investment out again, I think something will surely go wrong. I am curious though in any case.

I was thinking of bittaddress.org ability to generate random pairs of  addresses. Plus a transaction ledger that records and publishes each addresses interaction. In an election process, it would record every addresses decision. The only thing missing is how to limit the amount of votes received and to give the voters the ability to generate their address -ballot-.

*Can the coin have more than two faces? *Can I vote before the election? *Can I change my mind after voting before the election? *Can I protest if I feel that my vote was intentionally changed-hacked after the election? *Can I lie that I voted one way and still protest that someone changed it after the election?
