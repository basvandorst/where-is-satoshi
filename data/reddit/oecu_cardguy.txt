This boils down to poor authentication practices prior to issuing device tokens on the part of the issuing F.I. 
It's certainly a problem for the 54 FIs who support Apple Pay. Hopefully they will move to a stronger authentication model quickly.
I haven't looked into it, but would there be a way of storing BTCs within the encrypted chip in the iPhone or would it need to be connected to an online wallet... hmmm.
NFC transactions with BTC interchange level costs would certainly make for a win-win-(lose) for the Retailer-Consumer-(Issuer) - I'm sure smarter people than me are working on that :)
Appreciate the link, despite it not being especially BTC related.

Not so much "Tax Evasion" but under Money Laundering Regulations, most financial institutions would be *extremely* ...let me emphasize that again: **extremely** reluctant to make that option available.
See: [The Internet Archive Federal Credit Union](
The main problem is that in order to fully satisfy regulators, you'd have to spend a very long time addressing examiners, auditors and regulators concerns - so much so, that you wouldn't have any time to conduct any actual business.
Having said that, there is definitely some momentum brewing. But in terms of timeframe I'd expect banking for industries in states where marijuana is legalized to come prior to F.I.s accepting BTC or any other cryptocurreny as payments. 
edit: I always mess up links

There were many people who took loans to speculate in the booming 1929 stock market.
I'm happy that his gamble paid off.

Hadn't seen this linked yet, apologies if it's old news but I found it (and the linked articles in it) very informative.
