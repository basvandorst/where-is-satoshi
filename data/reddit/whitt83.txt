Again though, things do stuff for people.  They belong to someone. Give the money to the person.  They themselves don't need to have money.  I get  bitcoins, and I get IoT, but I can't fathom why a thing would need money.

Why does my thing need any form of currency?  It's a thing.

Do not taunt the IRS. Hell,  even the Joker feared them!

Not sure how I feel about that.  I'm concerned that the rise in value is too large too fast.

I thought there was no block reward once all the bitcoins have been mined?

Do not taunt the IRS (or your local equivalent).

I suppose.  Why not just prefix bitcoin with the SI unit?  mBTC = 0.001 bitcoin? I think Mt. Gox was the first exchange I saw do that.

versus what? Dollars &amp; Cents? Pounds &amp; Shillings?

Whois shows the domain was registered on 03/23/2013...  Awfully suspicious.

Why BS? I mean, that's the sole purpose of exchanges: to change currencies to other currencies.  If I want to buy a cheeseburger, I don't send my bitcoins to Wall Street first, I send it directly to McDonalds (someday...)

The exchanges are just fiat to bitcoins -- this doesn't mean bitcoins aren't changing hands.
