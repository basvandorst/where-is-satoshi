but aren't we a few thousand blocks away yet?

i had no choice in terms of picking the fee. It was paid by the site that I used automatically. But thanks, i hope so.

I get that, but since they are taking such a high fee, they shouldn't be stupid about the transaction fee.

its not urgent at all, I just don't like the idea of blowing 710$ into nothing. Had no idea that it can take that long

ahh good to know, thank you. I have a transaction that is stuck for over 36 hours already now, because the website didn't pay proper fees. so I'm more then looking forward to it :)

I wonder how many of the btc-owners know about this issue :|

Since you seem to know a bit more than me, I'll ask this offtopic question aswell if you don't mind: How many transactions / sec can we expect after Segwit activation?

can just say the same again: i had no choice in terms of picking the fee. It was paid by the site that I used automatically.
I assumed that they wouldn't be greedy on that since they take a fee of 3% already

it is not a bitcoin-exchange, its a site for virtual goods, and thats just their terms for cashing out into "real money"

No fee with the tenex card. But the deliverytime is very high sadly
