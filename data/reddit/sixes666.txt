One step at a time. Fix today's problem then work on tomorrow's.


There are many more who want the immediate problems fixed. A permanent solution can wait 6 or 12 months, as you said.

I didn't say that. From my POV, the problem is I'm getting a crap service. Core could take a small step to solving that without breaking anything.

I'm a Bitstamp fan. They have a good API.

    It can be phased in, like:
    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
        maxblocksize = largerlimit
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:03:37
Double the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:41:51
As a user, I wish both sides in this argument would simply STFU and fix the problem.
Core: Double the blocksize overnight and fix the backlog.
BU: Gracefully accept that the immediate problem has gone away and work with core on BU ideas, Segwit and whatever else will make the users' lives better.
Thank you.

Just been looking at OpenBazaar. The client seems less than stable.  Is anyone using it with any success?
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:13:35
I agree. That wasn't really the point I was trying to make, though I admit I put it badly.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:59:49
Worked like a dream. You're a star.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:45:10
I had not noticed that feature. Thank you for pointing it out.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:34:51
Nope.  Looks like they're not going to any time soon.

If you're unregulated, you'll find it hard to get a bank that will accept USE for you.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:06:15
Jokes aside, what fee rate did you use?
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:39:35
My bank charges 25c to move money from one bank to another via SEPA.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:19:20
Urgent, no but now 28 hours later, it's beginning to feel like this is an extremely slow network. I'm using Bitcoin Wallet and, going forward, I'll increase the fee.
Many restaurants and other businesses give excellent service at first and then they get popular and the service level drops off. I feel that that is what's happening at the moment with Bitcoin.
I'd hate to see it go out of favour because of poor service.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:47:26
Actually, you've all been very helpful and informative, other than the first two responses. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:39:01
Why do you think I am a troll?  I'm making what is, to my mind, a valid point.  I needed to move 2 BTC from one walet to another and it's taken more than a day.

Would you trust a site that uses apostrophes like that?

Isn't that how all betting works? Roulette, for example, has a 37:1 chance against winning (38:1 in the US) but only pays 36:1.
Bookmakers set the odds so that they (usually) win.  What did you expect?
@_date: 2016-09-11 13:17:09
About 3.7 million to one.
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:20:59
That's 75 BTC they were laundering.  How is this news?

How could someone steal your coins?
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:24:29
Why do you need all those permissions?
