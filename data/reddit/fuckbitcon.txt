Just happened to me.  Sold my stellar Lumens (XLM or STR)  and I never got the USDT.
Then I cancelled my orders and never got the USDT.
Wall street JPM Jamie Dimon organized crime Mcafee are using this scam now, I guess they hired the people behind it, and lets not forget korea china and europe.
Wow these people are pure evil with no conscience and as God is my witness I will not stand silent as they attempt to get further into our lives

Omg I hate bitcoin with a passion.
I just discovered how they con altcoins.
They found a way to take all the alt's money under everyone's noses.
I was battling against them the last 2 days.
If you own alts you need to get yourselves some protection wales asap.
SPREAD THE WORD - SECURITY FLAW YOU'RE CRYPTO ASSETS ARE AT RISK :
BITCOIN WHALES LIKE TO STEAL ALT MONEY AT NIGHT ON TRADING EXCHANGES - Be careful!
sharks and whale working for BTC have been spotted in the middle of the night  manipulatinig artifically  their  values  the steal from the bots
1) they lowball the price
2) they buy cheap from trading bots or anyone up panicin
3) they pump back up, 
4) bots get all excited and follow the scam signal
5) boom you wake up in the morning and you're like wtf
6) rinse an repeat.
BTC squad just played you and made away with millions of dollars
Where do you think BTC was getting all its recent pump money from?
'us my friends:
the volatility of Bitcoin is  by design and exist for this purpose..
WARNING: please take the proper security measure to protect the whole market cap of your coin, from these criminals..
BTC tend to be more organized...
example: its easy to write a short script that contantly monitors the price to keep the at ASKING pricwe
a single person can drop the value by bidding low (they startby buying all the bids then they put a wall of lowballed  offers to by )
When they have real walsl ansd mor emoney it gets more complicated but don't worry, I am sure you can find professional security to hire.
they stole 1/3 of a billion dollars from stellar since the se pumps started
Would you invest in ISIScoin if they had acrypto coin that pumped alot butas you know fuel terrorism.
it&lt;s only been like 1 months since I started interacting with Bitcoin gang member and during this time I have never been exposed to so much criminality and dishonesty.
Just last week 2 street thugs near m home tried to fool me into emptying my bank account
someone here cloned my identiy
They even came into my fav channel to post link phishing website to get me to send them my  private lumens address.
and it goes  and on and on.
Please help put  a stop to all of this..
it goes on and on
Im sure alot of you have been duped into holding a coin that was dropping by someone pretending to hold too while behind the scene the BTC whale hit squad pump and dump and do what they do best which is rob people.
If anything please record any suspicious individuals..you might help fight criminals who spend all their time  ingeneering new way s to rob people/
