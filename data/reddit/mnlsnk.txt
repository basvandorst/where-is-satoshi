Oh don't worry about my typo my little friend - I'm here to be YOUR teacher today...
Seeing how far some have creeped into Ver's ass it's not surprise how uninformed these shills have become. Also, Coinbase is working on implementing SEGWIT - confirmed by Brian Armstrong yesterday.
Your Bcash shilling days are numbered - soon you will still the real king.
PS. When you run out of points to make don't run to your grammar Nazi tactics...its cheap.

lol OP forgot to think. Try to breakup a gold bar into small parts and see if you can create more Gold by doing so...Please report back with your findings! But Bitcoin does fork and that does "create" more value in the whole crypto ecosystem by doing so. Will this be a problem?

In the US, you're required to report capital gains or losses to the IRS when you sell your BTC. Short Term Capital Gains Tax is higher than Long Term Capital Gains Tax meaning If you sell your bitcoin before 1 year of owning it, you'll end up giving a bigger piece of your profits to the IRS. If taking your initial investment out means you'll be selling your Bitcoin then you will have to report it to the IRS.

I totally agree - We're basically in a traffic jam on the way to the moon at the moment.
:( 
Hurry the fuck up Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:27
This stability could also be partly due to the lack of proper infrastructure in crypto exchanges - so many new users can't even get verified on Coinbase let alone purchase any BTC. As a result there's alot of new fiat being bottlenecked into the market.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:11:07
could be this...

Soooo what's your reasoning? 
I don't subscribe to TA necessarily (just interesting to consider it at times)
I'm really curious to know the "serious" methodology that led you to that price projection of $1000USD?

As an example: you purchased 1 BTC @ $1000.00. 6 months later that same Bitcoin is now worth $10,000. You sell $1000 worth of Bitcoin or 0.1 BTC (your initial investment). When you purchased 0.1 BTC (as part of you initial investment of 1 BTC  you paid $100 for it. You now received $1000 as a result of your sale. You will need to report $900 in short term capital gains to the IRS for that tax year.
