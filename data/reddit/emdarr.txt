If you can, you should. If it were that easy, we all would. Good luck.

I am not disputing your numbers but market cap is a misleading statistic. 
To say that Bitcoin's market cap = $1 Trillion (as an example) does not mean that 1$ Trillion dollars or digital dollars or real $ has been put into it. It simply means that the going rate of exchange values 1 BTC at ~60K (in this example). 
If we follow the logic, a Bitcoin could be listed at, say, $1 Million without actually having had all that much corresponding equity put into it, simply because of the scarcity of coins being listed. Economic theory would state that supply and demand will balance this out, but this market is not incredibly rational ATM. 
To be clear, I don't see $1 million coming any time soon but these prices don't require the commensurate amount of capital, just a reduced amount of supply on exchanges (assuming there is a demand). In the event that some serious global problems occur, people may be less likely to part with BTC and supply will go down. 
There is also the chance that more countries fall victim to hyperinflation, and so BTC's nominal $ value increases radically, but it doesn't mean as much.

That's not necessarily true. There's a limit to how much hardware is being produced and it would take a long time to amass it now, barring some kind of absorption of mining companies or properties by a government. 
The game theory also still works, in that it wouldn't make sense for a government to destroy Bitcoin if they had so much hash power, because they could instead own 50% of all new coins. 
It is also an incredibly big financial bet for governments to make as if they were to spend all this time/money acquiring this capital, it would still be possible for BTC to enact some kind of fork to thwart it. Andreas has a video on this scenario I think, it's worth watching.

Just wait until USDcoin launches ;)

I think his/her point is that you initially need to buy into the crypto game, which requires fiat for crypto. 
Until people start getting paid in crypto, at least

Is weighted average price = amount of initial still at stake per btc? 
Never heard this use before but it makes sense 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:46:20
This is still a possibility. 50% correction wouldn't be that shocking.

Bitcoins won't run out until 2140. The theory goes that at that point, the game will switch to a fee-based model, but the fees will be very slight. 
There is also nothing to say that if this great experiment lasts that long, people choose, by consensus, to issue more fractions of coins into the ecosystem. A very light inflation or something like that. 
It is a fair question though - one that our great grandkids will need to decide

Maybe it's just me, but I can't help but think of Andreas as the Bernie Sanders of the crypto community

Not to be an asshole, but wouldn’t one unit = one satoshi, which was not 15x the price of an ounce of gold?

$10,000 is a round USD number, but when BTC crosses $10,000 dollars does not necessarily correlate to Euro, Yen, Yuan, Australian or Canadian dollars, etc.. It's a fair point but I think we overweight it relative to a global market

Well, I could be having a bad day and panic sold and bought bcash a few days ago, and remembering that probably wouldn't help with my bad day...

If you sold first and bought second I don't know what your profit would be - that depends on what you bought that first Bitcoin that you sold for. 
If you bought at 8100 and sold at 8150, you would "make" $50, but if you had a 1.5% fee to buy and 1.5% fee to sell, then you actually lost money, because you paid $101.25 on the purchase and ~$102 to sell. In that scenario, you've lost around $150. 
If you can trade for .25% fee, then you still paid a total $41 in fees for the buy and sell and you profited only $9. 
And this is ALL BEFORE whatever Capital Gains tax you may owe, so in the US, you'd owe an additional 15-35% on the profit that you made to the government if you were trading short term. 
EDIT: Realized OP's numbers were $8100 and $8050 but my point is the same, just quoted slightly different figures

DigiCash might be a good place to start

Is anyone worried that this will allow a huge opportunity for shorting bitcoins? Seems like that'd be a really easy way for banker types to suppress it unless im missing something 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:14:01
Question - in the event that a "run" from, say, the dollar to bitcoin were to happen, is it possible the US Govt could seize all the bitcoins held on exchanges, i.e.  Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:49:33
Is this why people say to keep their coins off of exchanges?
