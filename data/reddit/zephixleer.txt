Continued to survive as a decentralized currency after years and years of speculation from the main stream media that it's either a scam or going to crash because it's a bubble. 
It doesn't have to *do* anything but exist and function as designed, which it is. The network is improving with lightning nodes and segwit, though.

It may trade at $6000 soon, but guess what? Shit will trade at $60,000 some day as well. Hold until you profit, then hold some more after you pull out a nice chunk for another investment.

It's kind of like... We can choose not to care, sure. But he's ripping people off, essentially. Causing some real issues with trust in crypto. If you want bitcoin to thrive, you want that guy to fuck right off, I guess.

Man, it'd be nice if we were held to the same standard! I'll just print some money and pay off my debts! No more worrying about paying off those credit cards!

Maybe, but the cost is unfortunately relevant.

Do you think that people get rich and stay that way by doing nothing, without providing some value? Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is without some value and strength behind the original purpose. 
Besides, your statement can be applied to any stock exchange, as well.

You do understand that adoption of the technology is at an all-time high, right? There are more indicators that it will rise again than there are that it will stay where it is. Further adoption will drive the price up even further, simple as that.

Believe what you'd like. Truth is, we can't predict the future, but we can make guesses based on the knowledge we have. So far, everything points to another significant rise eventually. It's basic economics that if more people use it, it will rise in value. 
And as for another crypto taking that center stage, I'm sure you're right that another technology could outperform bitcoin, but the acceptance and actual use is what will drive the price for quite some time. Other than simple speculation, of course.
I'd also call bitcoin's prices anything but stagnant. Rising and falling by thousands is hardly stagnant. It has a very much alive market and the price isn't stuck at any specific price.

What? Where did you get the $1500 number?
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:57:27
Yup. It is... oil standard. The world's reserve currency. If suddenly the world stopped using the US dollar for this, it'd drop in value.
Bitcoin will see similar results as more pick it up.

Everyone calls it a crash, I call it Chinese New Year... good lord. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:05:42
Think I found the right channel! Thanks so much!
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:59:14
We can also add silly to the things we aren't understanding. \o/
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:19:45
But it is a four letter word... So, really what we have here is a failure to comprehend economics AND basic math.

Maybe my coins aren't looking as good right now as they were in December, okay? :P lol
Yeah, so maybe a little defensive. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:54:27
Yeah? Better than a 3200% ROI? Because that's what you'd have seen if you invested in mid 2016 and then sold at the peak late last year. Hell you could sell even now and still make insane profits.
So tell me again about Bitcoin, please.
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:42:14
having trouble locating the original, what do i search for? -Thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:39:41
Yeah, I mean look at the last US election, bruh!
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:53:42
Or $70 next week. lol -It's so crazy to think about that part of this situation.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:48:37
Yeah? How about the stock market? People invest every day in the stock market and you can literally say the same thing about that in the wrong context. Get outta here with that nonsense.
