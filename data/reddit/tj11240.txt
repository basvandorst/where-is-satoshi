GDAX pays very high fees on its transfers - for better or worse - so it'll arrive on the sooner end of the current bell curve.  This means that it also pushes the overall fee market higher, which is a negative in the long run.

Ah, RBF explains the weird shapes on [the mempool chart](  I heard that 'CPFP' also cause cheaper transactions to clear.

The order of operations would be: 
* buy coins these few past weeks, pump price levels
* buy shorting futures contracts as soon as it opens
* Sell the coins (hopefully at profit from the pump)
* Price plummets, contracts are fulfilled
* Buy back in long at major discount

There are plenty reasons it could go down to very low levels for extended periods of time, if not permanently.  Imagine if a major country like the US decided that Bitcoin was a threat to its commerce and way of being.  They could prohibit bitcoin exchanges and use as a currency.

I've never done taxes for crypto before but I know that losses can offset gains. Losses are considered a tax credit. And I don't know how fees factor in, but I assume you are only taxed on the coins that made it to sale.

I'm probably just going to hodl through and through.  I'd rather not incur any tax implications in mid December when I've made it all year without any.  Dollar cost averaging is great, but it makes a mess of taxes - luckily I think I have an accurate gauge on my cost basis. 
Plus if I hold for a few more months, my earliest coins will be considered long term capital gains instead of short term.

More shops and vendors accept it all the time. Once we get second level technologies like Lightning Network it will be used as an everyday currency. 
But for now, it's predomimantly a store of value, like a digital version of gold. It has value because it's a decentralized, global, unseizable, immutable, borderless store of value with a fixed supply. 
You'll agree that such a thing is worth what other people choose to pay for it, no more no less. So why not consider how you believe *others* will value it in the future. The masses set the price, so average sentiment cannot be ignored.

Not only that, but if you get rid of all industrial regulation, people will die.  Everything will be mopped up after the damage gets done by lawyers, who take their exorbitant fees.  You know the scale of the mesothelioma law industry?  Do we really want to see that with every dangerous chemical known to man? 
Healthcare costs will skyrocket because people will be getting incredibly sick.  And since there would be no large groups to offset the cost, even corporation-sized group plans would be painfully expensive.  Personal or family sized plans would be out of reach for the vast majority.  People would just go to emergency rooms and clog up the system even worse.  
This is a nightmare, and why libertarianism has zero pragmatic reality to it.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:20:39
It's great for showing older swings that would otherwise have been lost in the scale. It's a bigger deal when Bitcoin falls to $2 from $32 compared to the last few days, but wouldn't appear that way with a flat axis.

While this is all true, it doesn't address the potential scenario that if this recent price increase was caused by Wall St buying large amounts of coins, they could create the shorting future contracts and then dump the coins.

This is assuming you have the money ready to go day 1.  And it only beats DCA in 2/3 of the time, historically.  If you are paying into crypto with extra money left over from paychecks, this is really the only way to go.

This only accounts for between 10-25% of its value, depending who you ask and how its measured.  The rest of the value is the same speculation that gives Bitcoin its worth.

Its a market, so in theory no one controls it.  But there's evidence that miners have been flooding the mempool with tiny transactions with very high fees in order to push the average fee higher for everyone.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:06
This is not true, do you have a source? It's been stated many times that the date you gain access to forked coins is considered a taxable event with a cost basis of zero. And then selling or swapping them creates another event, of course.

It seems that simply hodling is the way to go.  Less stress, and no chance of making bad decisions that leave you with a lighter stack.  It seems the people that post here lose as often as they make out when trying to time the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:26
Yes, your value is directly proportional to the price of BTC. It may help to calculate your cost basis. Add up all that you've spent and divide it by the number of coins you own. This is your average price; if Bitcoin goes above this you have made a profit. Your cost basis will change with each purchase you make.

Spending bitcoin is also a taxable event. There's no escaping the tax. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:52:22
If you bought the recent dip, I'd consider it a fantastic entry point for late 2017. I'm still buying in, and each new purchase stands alone like someone just entering the space. Just prepare yourself for some excitement ahead, and learn to leave your emotions at home. This is not a game for buyer's remorse, fear, or over analysis. 
Spend some time (if you haven't already) learning about the underlying technology and the real issues. Are you buying because it's a store of value, a deflationary currency, or a quick buck? Think about what a good investment timeframe could be for yourself and stick to it. Keep your ear to the ground and determine what it would take to cause you to exit this position. If that condition is not met, be happy with hodling.  
No one is going to hold your hand, there's no training wheels here, but sticking to some principals might get you where you aim to be. 
Oh and don't fucking go into debt or trade crypto on margin, that's asking for trouble.

It really does have a major advantage in branding. Its been around for nearly a decade has has weathered many storms like contentious hard forks and threats from governments. No security flaws have been discovered either - the only way people get coins stolen is from vulnerabilities on their own machines, or being stupid. So people can trust Bitcoin. 
Because it is the largest and most esteemed, it gets the best development talent. There are currently exciting scaling technologies in the works that will cut down on transaction fees and confirmation times.

Imagine you are a well-financed mining company that favors an altcoin. You could 'invest' in many small transactions with very high fees, knowing that some of the cost would be returned to you because of your marketshare. This would hurt the prominent target coin and make your favored altcoin look better by comparison. It would also force other normal transactions on the prominent chain to cost more, driving more fees your way.
Do I personally think such a devious thing could be happening? Abso-fucking-lutely.

It's not comparing apples to apples, its completely unnecessary and likely to erode the previous points that were made. The purpose of Bitcoin isnt to replace governments.

I never said it *depended* on not being spent, only that it will cause the price to go higher yet.  I shouldn't have to explain the laws of supply and demand.  I agree with your second sentence, but I can't figure out your final one.  Spending Bitcoin is price neutral.

I gave BTC as a gift as well. I said I'll be hodling them in my GDAX account until I trust them not to fuck it up with a personal wallet, or the transaction fees drop to a reasonable level, whichever comes second. 
Even with the free transfer out, they'd still have to pay a large portion just to do anything with the gift, so I'll hodl until they learn the technology, and the fee situation gets better.

Its not great, but it could be considered harm reduction compared to other industries it may compete with and/or seek to replace.  Currently, BTC consumes the power of roughly one very large power plant.  But it should be noted that BTC mining mostly takes place where power is cheapest - or even would be wasted outright.

I don't think he was talking about exchanges.  Lets say you accumulate 1 Bitcoin over time and send the pieces to a private wallet.  If it came from $50 periodic chunks, your transaction fee to move the bitcoin off the wallet will be astronomical.  If you bought bigger amounts or at least send them off exchange in batches, then your eventual fee will be a lot lower.  Its just something no one really thinks about, but its there waiting.
I plan on hodling my stack for years, and by then new technologies will have wrangled the fees back into normalcy.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:14:13
The guys he linked to forced a contentious hard fork that divided the community and siphoned off value from Bitcoin.  Instead of creating a new brand, they rode coattails and tried a takeover.  It was not done in good faith.  Bcash decided that sacrificing decentralization is worth short term network throughput.  There are many ways to scale this technology, but if you increase block size arbitrarily there will come a point where only data centers can host a full node.  This goes orthogonal to the ethos of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin has promising technologies that address the exact problem of high fees and slow confirmations.  Lightning Network will add a second layer on top of the block chain where people will be able to send and receive payments near instantly at close to zero cost, and every now and then the hosts will check in with the main blockchain and settle up.  Bitcoin has Segwit now and Schnorr Signatures in development, and to ELY5 they optimize the packing of transactions into the blocks, and fit more in.  There are serious plans underway to scale with Bitcoin, the Bcash fork (one of many) happened due to short term vs long term values.

Set up a real retirement account first, and use play money for bitcoin/ethereum.  I recommend a Roth IRA with someone like TD Ameritrade.  Buy low cost index funds such as Vanguard's or Blackrock's.  I would also recommend shooting for 70/30% domestic / international to diversify.

Over the past two months I've been dollar-cost-averaging into a position of bitcoin and ethereum, putting in only as much as I could consider 'play money'.  I bought at peaks, and at troughs, and just held the entire time (selling incurs a taxable event).  I'm up 35% in 8 weeks as of the latest prices, but I don't plan on selling any time soon, just buying more and hodling.  I've kept my coins on a standalone desktop wallet instead of an exchange, but recently just moved it over to a Ledger Nano S, its secure and convenient as fuck.  
This could help me buy a house one day. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:10:43
I believe that it is a combination of general interest, adoption, and people hodling it.  [This is a metric of interest]( that corresponds to the price uptick.  If there is buying pressure, and people hodl the coins instead of immediately spending them, you'll see appreciation.  
Especially if large players like financial institutions start dipping their feet into this market, we'll see a hot streak.  Liquidity in the crypto market is well and good, and its important that vendors accept BTC, but the real appreciation comes from people who 'invest' in this coin.  
There is a fixed supply, so if you have increasing interest combined with investors effectively removing bitcoin from the market, then price will have to go up.

Yes, it requires USD held in their accounts to buy instantly. If you wish to catch a flash dip, pay the fees and use a credit card on Coinbase or a similar exchange. 
The resources needed to run this network are often supplied by very large power plants that flood the local market with cheap power. Think massive nuclear plant or hydro dam. It does have a hefty carbon footprint all considered, but so does Visa, PayPal, and the gold industry. At least it's being used to fuel the global economy and not some trivial act. 
The problem may get worse as mining difficulty increases in coming years and adoption rises, but new and more efficient mining rigs will fight that. It's an issue, for sure.
Lightning Network would help scaling and resource load, because not every transaction would need to be confirmed 6 times by miners like currently. It should arrive within 2 years or so.

[This guy did a great job writing up a primer](
Use a major exchange, understand what fees are involved, and I'd personally recommend moving your coins out to a desktop wallet on a clean computer.  When transferring coins, double or triple check the receiving address, there is not a single way to recover coins sent to a wrong address.  
As for a wallet, I've used Electrum with success.  Make sure you get the real deal from a secure download source.  Then protect your seed as best you can, those words are the entirety of your bitcoin hodlings.  If someone else gets them or you lose them, you no longer have your coins.  So do not save them on a computer or on the internet anywhere.  
The first purchase and transfer to a personal wallet can be daunting, but after that it becomes automatic. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:57:48

I don't really understand why you'd need a second hardware wallet.  I understand keeping your private seed in two different secure locations, but it seems to me that it's best to just buy a new wallet if you ever need to replace your first.  
Unless you are worried about being robbed or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:22:03
Ok I see what you are saying.  Supply cannot be ramped up on a global level to meet global demand. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:52:26
Right, but as long as you have your private seed, you can recover the coins from your singular hardware wallet even if it was taken from you (assuming the PIN remained unbreached), burned in a fire, flooded with water, or eaten by a dog. 
It's the private seed that matters; the hardware wallet is just a way to access it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:07:09
Right?  We should be spending bitcoin on things - and replacing what we spend as to not violate the sacrament of hodl.

It's a program that you run on a desktop computer or laptop, that only you control (as long as you downloaded a proper one from a secure source and do not have malware or viruses on your computer).
So if the exchange you buy from were to go belly up like Mt. Gox, or have a breach or something, you'd be just fine. If your hard drive crashes, the wallet is recoverable if you wrote down the seed phrase or private key. **Do not save either online or on your computer**
People here like to say if you don't have control over your private key, you don't actually own your coins.
If you have a significant stack, it's recommended to purchase a hardware wallet or create a paper wallet. These cannot be hacked remotely, it would take a social engineering / home intrusion / torture scenario to gain access.

Move BTC to a second wallet or exchange for a little while
Install a reputable BCH wallet from a secure source
Import forked wallet's seed to this BCH wallet from your old, main wallet. BCH balance should appear
Transfer BCH to an exchange that trades BCH, I used Bittrex
Sell BCH, buy BTC
Important - do not put your BTC back into your original wallet where the fork happened, use that second new one going forward (or make a new one if you kept coins on an exchange during this process per step 1). I read that in doing this split, there's a chance your private seed could get exposed - and that was all I needed to hear
Enjoy some extra coin
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:28:58
There's an implicit problem with shorting against a rising tide. We have 100k new average joes signing up to one exchange in a weekend. Manipulating the underlying asset to fulfill a futures contract is still possible, it's just that it becomes more costly to do so with so many new entrants buying.

Not OP, but I can answer.
It's the largest and oldest. Now this may seem like a logical fallacy at first whiff, but what it means is that BTC is anti-fragile. A currency and/or store of value must be resilient and secure, above all else. 
BTC has clawed back from 5 or so major crashes in value, each time the trough was higher than the previous peak. It has also fought off several contentious hard forks that can be considered hostile takeovers for all intents and purposes. 
This also means that in the past 8 years, no major fault has been found and exploited in the software. People can count on Bitcoin. 
And in being the largest coin, Bitcoin attracts the best developers. It's always been an open source project, and development continues to grow, with exciting second-level technologies on the horizon like Lightning Network and Schnorr Signatures. These will allow Bitcoin to scale to larger and larger throughputs.

Deflationary currencies have one significant advantage: people need to spend money to live. Even if they want to sock it all away, they still have base expenditures like food, shelter, clothing, and transportation. 
To be fair, it will get interesting when you have an inflationary currency competeting with a deflationary currency within an order of magnitude of exposure of each other. What do they say, bad money drives out good?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:30:48

GDAX is a cryptocurrency exchange that resembles something wall street uses. Buy and sell orders, pretty charts, etc. It requires that you verify your identity, but you gain access to cheap transactions. 0.25% for a market price order, free if you set up an order (I believe, it's explained in detail on their site).  Coinbase (who owns GDAX) charges 4% for credit card purchases, and you have to pay miners' fees to move the coins out. Most exchanges do something along those lines.
Now it does take a few days for a bank transfer to clear and funds to arrive at GDAX. Once you click "buy" they are yours instantly. Moving coins out of the exchange to a wallet will take the same amount of time that any bitcoin transaction takes - lately it's been between 15 minutes and a couple hours.
Transferring coins from the exchange to a wallet you own and control is free with GDAX. This is not typical of exchanges because all bitcoin transactions have a miners' fee.  Confirming a single bitcoin transaction uses more electricity than the average American home uses in a week. Ugly truth right there. 
It's recommended that you only leave your coins in an exchange if you have a negligible amount or if you are actively trading them. Otherwise, a desktop wallet, phone wallet (I personally don't trust my phone's security), hardware wallet, or paper wallet is the ideal parking spot for your stack.
People here like to say that if you don't control your private key, you don't actually own your coins.

I think you need to reflect on what 'value' means.  Why does gold trade for over $1000 more per ounce than its industrial and jewelry market account for?  Why does a newly built house sell for $50,000 more than the sum of all its construction and labor costs?  
Because its desirable by people, and they believe that others will desire it as well.  There's an expectation that it will be able to be traded for the same, if not more money in the future; its a durable product.  Another part of value comes from scarcity, which Bitcoin definitely has.

Do your own due diligence. But know that you do not need to buy whole bitcoins at a time, they are divisible out to 8 decimals. 
I'd recommend using GDAX for smaller dollar-cost-averaging schemes because they offer zero fee transfers out, and very low commission. This way, a $30 weekly purchase will still get you over $29 in your desktop wallet. Using other exchanges, or even Coinbase with credit cards, and you'd have $25 or less. Don't get eaten by fees.

Praying for a healthy mind and healthy body?  Why not actually do something constructive for your health, like improving your diet with a variety of healthy, unprocessed foods and exercising regularly?  Wishful thinking and prayer wont really help, but action will.

The only good argument that I've heard as to why BTC is not yet a currency is that the price is too volatile.  A good currency has a relatively stable value, people know what x amount buys them, and they can plan for future budgeting easily.

Yes, you write down your private seed - a phrase of 12 words - and keep that extremely secure.  If your hard drive crashes or computer gets destroyed, you can reinstall the wallet software and import your coins with that seed.

This is the same as the $102 million pizzas.  You spent bitcoin on goods, and helped develop the market and overall adoption as a currency.  You got fair value that day, whether you want to believe it or not.  Being a digital store of value will only get Bitcoin so far, for it to really blossom it will be both that and a full-fledged currency.  So its better than just selling your stack for fiat.  
You can't beat yourself up over woulda coulda shouldas.  My only recommendation is to purchase coins to replace what you spend, that way you can still hodl.

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:24:44
I hear this a lot, but I disagree, there definitely was a loss of value.  The only thing is, the hodlings are still in the market, so they are dynamic and haven't been locked to a price yet. Its the same thing as realized and unrealized gains in the stock market.  But actually less so, because you can spend bitcoin directly and purchasing power has decreased.

Carbohydrates? 
When you pull mineral sources of hydrocarbons out of the Earth and burn them on the scale that we are, it introduces megatons worth of CO2 to a relatively closed system - the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect can be proven by a third grade teacher, an aquarium, and a CO2 canister. Combine that evidence with the CO2 readings at Mauna Loa that show a dramatic rise in the past decades, and the logical result is the climate change we are seeing.

Tax applies to every sale or crypto to crypto trade.  Whether gains or losses, at the end of the year you have two piles of trades, those in which the underlying was held for \&lt; 1 year, and those that the underlying was held for \&gt; 1 year.  These are two different taxation rates.  You add up the trades from each pile and get a net result, and multiply each by the respective tax rate.  The short term is your current federal tax bracket, the long term is 15&amp; I believe.  
Its in your best interest to make trades based on maximizing the amount of LTCG trades.  You can choose which format you'll be taxed under, First in First out, or Last in First out.  You just have to be consistent or you'll be in for a world of hurt.

To each there own, but I've found a plan that works for me. I'm always open to alternative ideas, but dollar cost averaging and long term hodling minimizes tax obligations and stress, as well as timing risk. I know what I don't know; I'm not convinced I have a competitive advantage with day to day trading. There are some very smart, very weighty, very experienced, very leveraged players right now - they are the movers. 
Part of my personal investing thesis involves watching the technology and getting out if anything 'breaks' or is proven obsolete. That hasn't happened yet, this price action is all surface level manipulation by large players that doesn't truly concern me. My sights are on the horizon.

Doesn't this only matter if the BTC falls in the short amount of time you have it?  If you use a tractor trailer full of hockey pucks for an intermediary to buy altcoins, it doesn't matter as long as it retains value for the time between spending fiat on it and using it to buy altcoins.

This is where it can get complex.  You have to determine how long you plan to hold each purchased coin on average, and also how much of your stack you will be trading at once.  If its all your stack frequently, then you'll always be in the STCG bracket.  If you plan on only trading with a portion of your stack after a few months, there's more to consider, and you might qualify for LTCG.  
Lets say you have held your coins for an average of 10 months, some more and some less.  If you wish to sell a portion in expectation of a future dip, or just profit taking, then you'd be better off selling only those that you've owned for longer than 1 year, because you'd pay less tax on the gains.  You'd have to choose First in First Out, and you'd be selling the coins you've held the longest.  It depends how convinced you are of future events, to be honest.  But if you've bought a lot about 5 months ago and have been adding little amounts since then, LIFO* might be better, because its a big deal to get that batch to the lesser rate.  You're going to have to crunch the numbers yourself.  
Its always a good idea to set aside an estimate of your tax burden before buying back in.  If you reinvest everything, you're going to be on the hook for money you might not have.

What about purchasing goods and services using bitcoin?  I'm guessing I'm on the hook for tax and its the same as if I sold coins for fiat.  What is my cost basis?  Is it FIFO, FILO, or an average?  
I've read that it's tax-advantageous to purchase cryptocurrency *before* spending it on something, as opposed to spending first and then replenishing your crypto after.  
I got a feeling crypto is going to be the reason I start paying for a tax service to prepare my yearly filings, I've been doing my own successfully so far.

If Bitcoin has a hardfork, you gain an equal amount of the new forked coins, which are always worth just a fraction of BTC.  Its not nothing though, and can be thought of as irregular dividends.  This is another reason why you should control your own private keys for your coins, because if you have your stack on an exchange, then it will take much, much longer to get your forked coins (if at all), and the price will plummet when lots of people try to sell them at once.  
The Bcash forked coin could be sold for upwards of 20% of a Bitcoin at times.

Each trade is a discrete event that is tax liable.  The tricky part is determining which part of your stack you sold, and the cost basis of the exact coins you traded. You do get to choose FIFO or LIFO, but you must be consistent forever.  If you sell your whole stack at a time, it doesn't matter.  The first trade would be a gain of 1k, the second a gain of 500, the third a loss of 500, the fourth a loss of 1k.  Even though the percentile gains and losses are different, the monetary balance nets zero.  As long as you were using your entire stack, and not using some long term gains and some short term gains, I believe your net tax burden would be zero, because you get tax credit for the losses.  You would still have to declare every trade, of course.

Counterpoint:  If these people bought because they understood the technology to be revolutionary and disruptive, and not because they were chasing gains, then there is a better\-than\-not chance they have been dollar cost averaging through the correction as their buying power increases.  This is a best case scenario if you are in such a situation, you want to see a long runway before takeoff.  If its going to go up \(according to your analysis of the tech\), then you want a fair chance to stock up before it does.

All the news I see is slightly optimistic.  There's nothing major that caused 2018's slide, except for how quickly we rose in the preceding months.  The only thing that separates this spike/crash with previous ones is competition.  The crypto space is full of worthy competitors now.

If you lose a gold ring overboard on a cruise or consider electronics in landfills, it will be less energy intensive to just mine the same amount traditionally.  That gold is essentially removed from the system. 
By the time we have efficient landfill mining, we'll probably have asteroid mining too.  That will be the only thing that really affects gold supply in the future.

That's flawed logic.  They spent x amount of fiat on a videogame, by way of cryptocurrency.  They got exactly what they intended to, for the price they planned on paying at the time. 
You might as well wonder why you didn't live in austerity back in 2010 in order to put all of your normal expenses into BTC purchases.  Pointless to consider could-haves. 
What they did do was help the BTC marketplace develop, which is not nothing.

I've heard people more knowledgeable than me \(or at least seemed that way\) explain that Bitcoin will only become properly stable after its S\-curve of adoption, which could be 5\-10 years from now.  The market is far from saturated, and scarcity is still sorting itself out as we speak.  There are major market segments \- billions of people \- that are not yet aware of cryptocurrency, and are currently underserved financially and basically unbanked.

If you sell bitcoin for fiat or an altcoin, or spend bitcoin on goods and services, you owe capital gains tax on the price difference from when you bought. And if you are trading coins, you are most likely going to fall into Short Term Capital Gains, which applies if you hold coins for less than one year. It's a higher rate of taxation than long-term capital gains. 
This applies to one trade, or many. 
It's so much simpler and less stressful just to hodl.

@_date: 2017-10-14 19:33:50
The correct way to do it is to buy the bitcoin first, and use it for the purchase, instead of purchasing an item and replenishing your coins.  This way, there will be no tax liability you incur.  Order of operation matters.

Savings accounts are for short term goals, like saving for an automobile or maybe a down payment on a property - time frames less than 5 years.  There are decent options, Ally just increased their standard savings accounts' yield from 1% to 1.2%.

\&gt; What do you mean as long as I use all my entire stack?
When you sell, you sell everything.  
Leaving cash on an exchange or using part of your cash total doesn't affect taxes.  Only selling a portion of your crypto stack can affect taxes, depending on how long you've held it for.  
The idea this that you want to maximize your Long Term Capital Gains bracket.  You get taxed less on these trades.

This isn't true.  If climate change happens too fast, species will not be able to adapt.  Temperate forests will not be able to creep towards the poles, and tropical species will not be able to migrate towards the mid lattitudes - they will just die.  
The Earth has gone through many climate swings before, but never one this fast (ok, maybe the dinosaur killing asteroid hit).  It remains to be seen how many species can't keep up with the changes.  Its not a death sentence for local species if the desert expands, but it might be if it happens in the course of years instead of decades.

The net effect for the investor is the same, whether they choose a roth or traditional IRA.  Tax is a straight multiplier on your balance, and it is time independent in this function.  You get the same ending value if you take the tax at the beginning of the compound interest calculation or at the end. Crunch the numbers and you can see for yourself. 
Yes, with a Roth, the government gets less money but they get their money sooner.

The net effect of roth vs traditional IRAs are exactly the same.  Crunch the numbers and you'll see. The difference in advantage has to do with what tax bracket you are in now, vs what tax bracket you will be in when you retire.  Also, an IRA contribution could reduce your yearly taxable income below the next marginal rate in some cases.

Are you prepared to do the double blind studies and the associated analysis on every single food additive and medicine you consume?  There is a reason that drug companies must spend years working their way up from theory to animal studies to human trials.  It requires thousands of experts scrutinizing every single aspect of the safety, pharmokinetics, interactions, and efficacy.  This work simply wouldn't exist, and people would die as a result.  
Drug companies would simply work off of their reputation alone, and *that* is fear inducing.

China. They would have 10 professionally trained and outfitted soldiers for every one of your Davey Crockets, and associated air, naval, and intelligence support.  It would be a long, ugly guerilla fight, but I wouldn't take my chances against them for a second. 


You put too much faith in the benevolence of big agro.  They're barely being held in check as it is.  Imagine if they are not prevented from making foods more addictive and unhealthy than they already are.  Furthermore, small time family farmers wouldn't stand a chance.  They're land would all be bought out instantly. 
Without the FDA, you would have human guinea pigs.  Unsafe and unproven medication would be released en masse, and lawyers wouldn't even be able to clean up the mess because there would be no legal standing in which they could operate.  If people wanted years supply of pain medication, it would be simple to get.  You'd create an entire subclass of addicts not unlike A Scanner Darkly.

I did some deeper thinking and drew a sketch, and since the moon's orbital radius is &gt;&gt; the Earth's radius, the effect is negligible.  You'll probably be able to see the moon more than 49% of the time (but less than 50%).  
I also have a sneaking suspicion that latitude plays a role.  If the moon orbits in the solar plane, then it would spend more time hidden behind the Earth as it circles it, relatively to an large high or low latitude. Imagine a planet with no tilt, and a moon orbiting around the equator.  At its north pole, the moon would probably be hidden below the horizon the entire time (or if its a very wide orbit and you are on a mountain, the moon could be visible the entire time).  Its a damn interesting problem, lots of variables.
