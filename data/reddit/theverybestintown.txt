good luck.

Fuck it, I bought too high (13, 14, 15). 
I just doubled down and bought more at 9.9 
Just lowering my average, hope this pays off some day when it breaks 15
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:47:32
Bro, that's 2.4% gains. You should have seen 26.4% gains assuming you bought at 13K flat...
I would check on that
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:01:58
Stop spreading FUD, mate.

I agree in corrections and consolidation but saying "it should go down to 9ish or 8ish before it goes back up" is a pretty extreme statement. Looking at technical analysis (while I admit I have limited experience with) it seems to stabilize around 13 and high 12's before climbing back up. Maybe you have a rationale for it declining lower and if you do, please do share.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:25:37
Wait seriously?? Why?
That's a quick way to lose 800 bucks :/
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:28:22
Oh definitely! They may definitely be pumps/buying frenzies. I'd say "adoption" in the sense of more people are entering crypto is possible. But whether that means more people believe in the power of crypto is different.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:49:48
I do
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:28:31
I hope these panic sellers chill out a bit. It's also frustrating seeing these huge sell orders at 17K. This is just the beginning. Sure BTC will dip but just climb higher.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:18:40
Yeah me too. It will be very significant if we can break that psychological barrier and keep it well above 17 for the remainder of the weekend. Too many sell orders at 17 smh

I just bought 0.35 BTC. I wouldn't describe it as panic. It should go up above 15 soon
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:46:37
Same man same
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:10:38
There are a lot of factors that can affect a cryptocurrency's price other than adoption. FUD being the main one. FUD does not imply less adoption, but rather a panic sell. Some of these people may plan on buying in even lower or once it upturns. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:45:04
Is that sarcasm? or are you glad I'm adding to the buy effort?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:50:50
Yeah my thoughts exactly. It will most likely go up longterm so why bother stressing
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:02:08
Fuck yeah Asia
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:02
Thanks guys, just got verification today. It says 7 days until it goes into my account. Also, when the price was 12.8 I bought it but it says I bought at 13.02. I'm guessing this is some sort of commission or spread between buyer and seller? And if I want to sell, it's saying I'd sell for 100 less than current BTC price. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:01:55
Yeah I've been doing this all day with limited money but still. It was boring for hours and then Asia woke up and bam. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:11
If this shit drops to 13K I'm only buying more. I'm 0.38 BTC in (at 13K) and I'm ready for the storm. Buckle up baby
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:43:19
Asia is crazy, last night it hit 16.5 now we were just flirting with 13.5. Not sure about fundamentals tho, but technical analysis has me worried of either a huge crash or possible excited at the prospect of a major bull run after a bumpy course.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:16:01
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:56:51
Yeah, I understand that. I bought some this morning at 13. But I'm already hodl'ing some so I would like to make some more short term investments just so I can say I made some definitive profit while I hodl the rest for years to come.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:06:49
I purchased some BTC a couple days back. I used a bank transfer. I went to my bank and they said the acount was debited. But coinbase says that funds will be acquired dec. 13th. I can't sell until then. Why is it taking so long and can I do anything to expedite this process?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:05:44
Yeah exactly, I'm new as well but have been doing this on gdax. It seems to be working. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:53:13
predictions for tn? I'm hoping for 16
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:25:48
I'm hoping for a push to 16.5 tonight. Let's see some real momentum.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:30
Yeah idk what spacedrgn is on about
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:16
Charge him in bitcoin for your service
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:03
Yeah this is most of what I'm doing at work today.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:49:13
...and? I've seen people sell 60+ BTC on gdax

anyone else kind of coming to terms with trading strategy and motivated for btc in the future? I know almost for certain it will go back up to 10 K by EOY, so it makes sense to buy here or anywhere a bit lower and make a fucking pact to sell when it gets up there, rebuy at dips etc.
