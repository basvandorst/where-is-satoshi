This is not how humans work. Humans build bomb shelters because they are selfish, they don't come together and have world peace.
Humans aren't educated on how to be enlightened, serving the good of everyone! (Which ultimately helps you). Humans are educated on how to screw each other, lie, and make the most money. It is society's fault for not educating them, not the human's fault.
People are in the way of growth...  Being 2017 and Jetsons and such being promised long ago... I think it is clear we are in the way of growth. So technology can help people understand how to grow! Hooray Satoshi, and Bitcoin, deflationary currency to teach consumers not to consume! To teach gov fiat to not print like crazy...

Who'is laughing at me?
Just you? Whats up? How are you? :)
@_date: 2017-04-13 05:32:21

How are you?

It is worth the effort kind of like a nuclear deterrent for the population of Ukraine to show they will not be shut down in the event of a total take over. The blockchain keeps their data completely immutable and secure. Historical way of backing up your shit. Elected people to run you information's... important level shit!

Thanks people who fight for choice! Very high concentration of those people doing the best they can, right here in this community! Isn't it cool we have the internet to thank them so easily? We need to be grateful and do it more often :)
Really important to remember I think! Satoshi was very ego free when he gave us Bitcoin... foundation of Bitcoin is built on gratitude!

Society should be spooked by bitcoin. Banks/Finance companies are one of the main benefactors of the fiat printing press... and loaning at crazy interest rates... Deflationary currency is going nowhere. BTC is real with 17 million in circulation already.
Bitcoin is a very spooky, virus for money... glorious

Wow they are "backing up" their government. This is actually really smart... citizens elect the government, blockchain ensures government can't be destroyed,  because blockchain is BITCOIN. Weird Money/info/value store of value merge.

Well that's how savings work. You prefer not to spend, but life demands food or you want something(like housing) and you spend. Deflationary teaches people they don't need things as much as consumerist culture has you believe
Most people prefer to spend and spend and never save, so a deflationary currency rewards those people. Instead of giving that reward to government monopoly money printers, bankers, and wall street in some fractional reserve scam that only fiat had.. until Bitcoin put an end to all that shennigans

They had a strategy officer, but didn't have a Chief. Kind of like a Warchief, in Warcraft 3 when Thrall became Warchief... it was a new title, but they had a general strategy without him as Warchief.
The better question is, has he played Warcraft 1-3? Is he ready to lead the horde?

This is good news for people
Store your money, realize it is not being controlled by evil bankers for the first time in history of money. No Bailouts, no inflation, no bullshit. Blockchain, baby.
Then, do something else because now we have solved money with this glorious technical innovation. We can worry about other stuffs! Lets talk about it!
Praise deflationary currency economics... patience increasing your value, not USING your money increasing your ability to do things with MONEY. Real Money, Bitcoin of course... not fiat monopoly money

I would say... Jews attacking society for Bitcoin... this is good news for bitcoin

You heard him boys, we need more trolls. Frontline trolls to stand up to the misinformation disinformation evil plot to stop Bitcoin.
You have my keyboard.
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:10:42
Lol woah someone throwing down the cesspool gauntlet! Very angry fellow! :)
yes... real news is facts and bullshit is presented as truth. Trolling is how works get done these days. Front line trolls to combat the ogre's of deception.
Go call out some bullshit on see how it works for you :)

Well you get paid in monopoly money, then turn it into Bitcoin. Good people, early adopters, get Bitcoin first. Hooray! They can't really change from fiat overnight. Bitcoin exists though and can't be ignored. Deflationary currency will change things, for good.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:27:48


Don't be so binary...Bitcoin users will have the say, as usual. The main usecase of bitcoin to ensure a decentralized currency will be protected. The changes will come when they will, as long as Bitcoin isn't hurt than no worries. It is good that the miners understand they are not the only option, thanks UASF.
They may celebrate if UASF doesn't get activated, but they will learn a major lesson :).

Chief Strategy Officer? 
So is he good at StarCraft? Has he been tested? How many years RTS experience?
