Interesting thought. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:14:57
I love the way you did that. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:05:51
I'm assuming down-voters are either veggies, or lack the imagination that this can be made to attach to pretty much anything. Belt. Bug Bag. You name it.

As a kid, I would go out and hunt with my dad to put food on the table for family meal time. I can tell you that out of all the times we went out, only a small number of those occasions was to hunt. The other times were taking care of the wild, trapping and vaccinating sick bunnies. I don't remember ever having seen an animal rights advocate helping us keep the wild animal population healthy. I hunt no more, but can tell you that if there ever was a need to hunt to eat, I'd have no troubles. Just as how a hungry bear would have no trouble putting me on the menu. I have considered your opinion, though, and will look for an alternative.

That's like saying who carries around one of those new +$1400 I-phones because somebody could take it. Let's say you're going to a family wedding and want to represent Bitcoin in a more fashionable way.  I've also modified a few so they can be attached to belts, bags, etc...

Maybe you're traveling and don't want to take a smartphone with to avoid the possibility of being tracked via gps, but need to carry some crypto on. Again, some people have multiple ledger's. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:54:33
Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its public key cryptograph, standard called secp256k1 (y 2 = (x'3 + 7)over(ኀp). To prove owner‐ship or Bitcoin, wallets use 256 bits of entropy (randomness), into the SHA-256 hash algorithm which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number. Wallet like the ledger nano, use bip 39 to translate a private key into a 24 word backup. If you buy the ledger nano with a preloaded wallet, you are the target of a hacker trying to steel your funds. Always create a new wallet by generating a new private key. Nothing beats dice. I hope I answered your question.

I'm testing Samuria. So far I love it! Still. Smart phones are a nightmare for security. If you need to move about without the concern that you are being watched via your phones GPS, then ledger nano is a good solution. You can walk into any library and be your own bank!
