Bitcoin crashed.
I still have no idea how Bitcoin works, but intuitively I felt like I didn't have to invest.
I do it in different ways. I buy a CD album and listen to it. I buy a guitar and play it. A Bitcoin doesn't have strings.
The nice thing is - and this really satisfies me - two weeks ago when I was finishing a real estate congress talk;
three money-guru's were proudly talking that they invested heavily into Bitcoins.
It wasn't  the first time that I saw a bubble explode in front of my eyes.
It makes me think about Uncle Cheese.
Except he wasn't an uncle, he just wanted us to call him that.
Uncle Cheese was entranced by a piramid scheme halfway the eighties.
Years and years he explained us how it worked. You make eachother rich. One gives money to ten friends and those ten friends give money to another ten.
In this ideal world that Uncle Cheese described, nobody would have to work anymore.
Everyone on earth would just give eachother money. That's how easy it was.
Deep inside I already felt that something was wrong about this. I expressed my worries.
I asked why other people never thought about this idea before. Uncle Cheese explained.
It was the power of simplicity. The possibilty to think of solutions. 
Six weeks later, Uncle Cheese was carrying a rotten cauliflower under his arm from the food bank.
I asked him how the situation was going.
It was other people. A couple of assholes kept their money and didn't give it to their friends.
Also then, I felt triumph. I felt good that it didn't work out.
I feel like this with the crashing Bitcoin right now.
All those miserable people, actually they're just saving themselves the time.

Was the translation so off that something this obvious would occur? I did it on purpose to laugh at dutchies choice of names, that's all :D
