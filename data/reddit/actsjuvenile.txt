Which researcher / article are you talking about in the post title?  Link plz

I disagree. 11K Reachable nodes are what the crawler was able to reach within past 24 hours, while Luke's node list includes all "seen" nodes whether online or offline.  In Luke's list a laptop node connecting from home and school would count as two nodes.

What is the **registration fee**?  If the fee is in thousands of dollars, it will definitely lock out most of the developers and dreamers from ever completing their idea.

Holy crap - these are some serious rigs fro 2011!  How did you afford so many graphics cards?  Did you mine enough to cover the costs, or perhaps enough to retire in Monaco?

I had 20 Bitcoins and I sold them at $40 :-( I regret it a little bit now, but I had no idea Bitcoin would become what it is today. 
I wonder how many Gavin Andresen has, since he was funding the Bitcoin faucet and giving away 1 BTC to EVERYONE every 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:06:11
Wow - how much do you reckon he made in 2013?

Bear market is just beginning, so you have plenty of time to buy lower. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:52:17


You are talking about money laundering, not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:22:54


lol I am guessing OP bought at 20K and now he is posting desperate thesis to save his financial ass
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:24:54
You know the wrong sellers then.  One Indian I know is buying at discount because everyone is panic selling to withdraw their cash. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:20:36
Plus Bitcoin has been dead as a shopping cart payment solution for a long time.  Bitcoin needs a killer application, and shopping is not it.

WHOA WHOA WHOA - calm rational discussion between OP and this guy?  Am I on the wrong website?

Don't listen to Reddit folks for answer - always refer to a research paper or white paper from.  Here is a paper from Columbia Uni on how to scale Bitcoin:

Look at my last post in history - it includes a detailed timeline.

Yeah. Coinbase is a middleman.  They buy from others and sell to Coinbase customers, so arguably Brian and his douche-bag cofounder bought it on behalf of customers.

Don't listen to these rational people OP.  You will be able to afford a much hotter girlfriend when we all touch MOON LAMBOS!

They are legit and they just won a top-10 finish at 500-Startups Incubator.  
More news here:

He bought most on MtGox down the street in Japan.  Mark Karpeles released 500 richest Bitcoin addresses on MtGox, and Roger was  with 100K coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:36:48
How can they do that?  Is there a difference in what addresses look like?
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:56:04
I trust you now Mark - You lost a lot of weight and looks like you are slowly getting your life back in control.  
Back in the MtGox days you were probably stress binging on quiche and Frappucinos and it showed.  Good luck with your recovery and hope to see you in Japan after all this is over.

I am guessing OP is long and watching a sea of red so he is trying to spread positive fud.  It will hurt his pockets more to stick his head in sand like this.  Quote from the budget minister is crystal clear - no two ways about it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:24:27
You are right about everything, except the enforcement power of the governments.  If government makes Bitcoins illegal, it will no longer be available to 99% of the people in the country.

They have announced that already, but in softer words.  Expect used Chinese mining equipment to hit the market in 3 months.

Umm the article is about South Korean companies.  You know, the other Korea which is not North Korea.

I would also add Fluffcoiners to the list.  The guys who bought at 15K-19K and are now desperately posting fluff stories in hopes of attracting more FOMOers. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:36:54
This is correct.  OP seems overly optimistic to me.  Hedge your trades guys, don't be married to short or long positions.

Ethereum is more likely to overtake us man.  It's a real threat now unless devs get off their asses and do something groundbreaking.

Are you guys working on new features to buy and sell Bitcoins like Coinbase?  I can't imagine what new features can help Bitpay survive...

That was outsider info, this is insider info from NASDAQ executive.
PS: After reading your edit, Forbes news is a different solution for Cap Tables on blockchain.  My leak is about millions of stocks traded daily on NASDAQ.

I can't TL;DR the entire discussion here but XOOM CEO had a solid, fact-based argument and he convinced me.  
Here is a good read by someone who was part of a Bitcoin remittance company in Phillipines: 
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:01:02
PayPal had hundreds of competitors including well-funded ones like Flooz.com, InternetCash.com, and Beenz.com.  PayPal emerged as the leader because it had a killer application: it could be used to pay for online auctions on eBay.
Bitcoin doesn't have a killer app right now.  Until some new must-have killer app comes along, Bitcoin is not going to go mainstream as a payments mechanism irrespective of time.  Other parts of Bitcoin like Blockchains are showing more promise in real-world usage.
@_date: 2015-11-03 05:50:58
You can't send "unlimited" amounts using Bitcoins.  For example, if you try to do a USD-to-PHP remittance for $250K, your purchase will spike the price-per-bitcoin by &gt;$4 based on Coinbase order book.  And it will be a feat to cash-out $250K worth of Bitcoins in Philippines within a reasonable amount of time.
