The best time to get into bitcoin was in 2010.
The second best time is now.

It really all depends on if you believe in the system.
If you truly believe that Bitcoin will soon replace the banking system (as I do), you will never “cash out.” Your bitcoin will only increase in value, as it has been doing since 2010.

I will agree that the headline in question is clickbaity, and perhaps I could have found a better article to prove my point.
I don’t think that this is a bad example, though. Senate bill C-16 extends protections against hate speech towards gender-fluid people. The bill purposefully does not declare definitions of gender pronouns or identity. The [Canadian Department of Justice website] ( states that the bill will not define the terms itself, but it will instead be based on the existing definitions provided by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. 
So, on the [Ontario Human Rights Commision website] ( the organization *specifically* states that using the incorrect gender pronoun will likely be considered discrimination.
This has popped up in several cases, including one in which the Vancouver police [were fined] ( by the human rights tribunal for misgendering a trans woman (among other things).
Correct me if I’m making any mistakes here; but from the outside looking in, this looks like the Canadian government is threatening free speech under the guise of “progressive” action. 
What do you think?

Oh, I had no idea. Thanks for clearing that up, stranger. Guess I shouldn’t have posted without an actual working knowledge concerning those things. 
As for the post above (regarding gender pronouns), that’s still nation-wide, correct?
If you have the time, what are some better examples of Canada being “behind the times” in comparison with the US?
