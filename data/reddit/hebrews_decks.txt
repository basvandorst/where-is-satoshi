If in reading this right he wants to buy 10-15000 bitcoins not $15000 worth?

I have a story of how I bought ETH at 388 earlier this year went it spiked. Then it crashed back down to 200. I thought I had made a huge mistake and missed out on a bunch of returns. I ended up just holding longer and eventually doubled my investment when it hit 850. Litecoin has a lot of potential, it really depends on a few factors, how long do you want to see a return on investment and do you need the capital immediately.

At this point I think enough people have vision and have had that vision for a while. This project as well as many others are leading a revolution that will be huge. Short term market fluctuations are just part of new tech advancements. My reasoning for why this has been as wild as it has it because this is technology that can and will revolutionize the world. Decentralization of information and how it's exchanged will really bring power back to the people and change an on going paradigm from power over people to power with people. This is just the beginning.

Oh absolutely it's more about the technology behind and the tech that will evolve from it. Bitcoin is the pioneer and a fantastic network and I'm sure will continue to advance along side numerous other projects in the space.

From what I can tell most of this industry is speculative. We have tokens and coins coming out without a product to back them. The potential is nearly limitless and if solutions to the obstacles are realized I think it will shift more towards the value the network provides. BTC also has a brand name type appeal going for it too so until there is more mainstream adoption that is sure to affect the price and what networks are supported. Really hard to say what/who will come out on top.

Definitely have to be competent at day trading and a bit lucky to make consistent profits. It's a lot easier to hodl and generally a safer bet. I have yet to hodl and lose money. Day trading I seem to always be one day off on timing and miss out on larger gains.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:04
I'm one to just periodically buy and hodl my last set of buys were obviously short term losses but if I've seen any kind of pattern if you wait long enough they will turn into gains.

Really depends on how patient they are. I've bought in at highs multiple times and have yet to lose money.

At this point it's better to day trade alt coins anyways.

To topple centralized networks and bring power to the the people in an unprecedented level of exchanging information and services.
Money is cool too.

For real, people freak out no matter what happens if they haven't experienced it before. If anything get ready to double down and prepare for an even bigger upswing.

This is blatant misinformation and lack of understanding on how the Korean banking system works.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:39
Hodl or broke is the way to be. Pretty much all house money for me at this point.

We are all criminals in the eyes of the government.

Wtf is this garbage?

People place buy and sell orders at different values and this can trigger cascading effects if the price falls quickly. There may be dips but the trajectory has still been an upward one.

Thank you for this, education is the best defense against fear.

Both ETH and LTC have proven fantastic investments, each one has show exponential growth over the past year. I think ETH is a great bet, amazing team and really innovative tech. LTC is solid too and even at $100 is cheap in comparison and could follow the same pattern as ETH or BTC over the next couple of years. 
As others said definitely diversify. Even some tokens that are up and coming seem worth while to me. Golem, chain link and RLC are three I think are doing some great things and have strong teams. This market is still brand new and it'd be foolish to only focus on BTC.

Yeah I'm definitely not going to be mining coins but some tokens I definitely want to set up a node or so for.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:39:40
Yeah I don't know much about mining or setting up nodes but it's something I'm definitely looking into. I've seen enough people posting about building rigs and doing well that it seems profitable if you have the overhead.
