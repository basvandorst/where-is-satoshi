So you sent a wrong transaction using Mycelium, which is not yet confirmed, and want to spend those same coins to a different address with a higher fee? 
I (may be wrong but I) think Mycelium has no RBF option and so your first transaction didn't have this flag set. So it's up to the miners if they will accept a double-spend with a higher fee. I would try a clean installation of Mycelium and recovery of your seed, perhaps the wallet won't see the wrong transaction if it's not yet confirmed and will allow you to make a different one with the same coins.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:34:30
Checked your link, saw your transaction costed 59 satoshis per Byte (see the Fee/size field) - that's much below the average of transactions waiting in the mempool to get into a block right now (66sat/B at the moment I'm typing this). It's just unfortunate it was a low value but very large tx because of 64 tiny inputs.
 There was no cheaper way. If you used a different wallet for this and manually set the fee too low the transaction could even never confirm, but if you picked right then likely you'd spend about 20-30% less and wait a few hours to get it confirmed

The legacy banking system has already left and cut off that region. What options do they have outside paper cash and barter? A perfect opportunity to introduce a blockchain based solution, as long as they got access to the Internet. It could be Bitcoin, if someone sells them enough coins, but they seem to be building their own platform, which it may be not as good for the people (controlled by the separatists, not decentralized).

@_date: 2016-08-01 11:12:12
If the transaction won't get confirmed in a day or 2 then it will be dropped from the mempool and just like it never happened - 
I'm just not sure how the particular wallet handles this, perhaps it will see it automatically or after hitting the refresh button (top right corner), worst case you'll need to do key recovery, but coins won't be lost.

People missing the most obvious metric. The number of blocks being mined. The network's hashing power continues to grow and there haven't been a difficulty adjustment in almost 2 weeks. Right now blocks are being mined about 15% faster than they will after retarget. This has combined with the usual Sundays' lower transaction volume so lots of older transactions made their way to blocks today.
Don't look at the price. Price crash can mean more people wanting to cash out but it's not the case here. Remember that for every seller there has to be a buyer.

I'm experimenting with this site right now but I find that it's estimates are way off most of the time. And I'm not even talking about the fees but transaction sizes.

Opponents often call LN centralized and controlled by banks. I doubt that, but I'd really like to know **what are the requirements** to run a fully participating LN node?
 Is it about  hardware - processing power, storage, network bandwidth?
 Or is it more about the amount of BTC that you have to keep locked in multiple opened channels? What would be the BTC amount needed to have a LN node fully contributing to the decentralization of the system? 1 BTC, 10 BTC, 100 BTC, 1000 BTC ?

Thank you for the answer. But what you described is the requirements for ordinary users. And I was more interested in becoming a LN hub, operating 24/7, with 15+ channels opened and able to fully contribute to the LN's decentralization and liquidity. 
About hardware/network requirements - Would this role require to run a fully validating Bitcoin node with a full copy of the blockchain?
About funds - I know there's a limit of Lightning tx size at just 0.0429BTC in order to have the channels not empty too quick. I know of solutions to refill channels off-chain (by creating loops of nodes drawing from each other's channels). But I'm interested in practical amounts needed to have locked in each of channel to have it run without regular on-chain refills.

Sad truth is it won't come soon enough because it's not something that can be rushed. Looking at how quick SegWit adoption is there's no way to be optimistic about time. And LN is even more complicated tech, so even after a stable mainnet release it will take months if not years to get included in wallets, web services, and by payment processors. But when it finally does it will be epic.
That's why we need a temporary band-aid solution block size increase hardfork. It shouldn't take long to develop, and if Core supports it, miners that wanted x2 should too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:29:31
And behind every of those transaction is a poor human being, crying or biting their hands from nerves. This is a luck based system, even with a high fee for a given moment people can get unlucky when no blocks get found in 30 minutes and transactions pile up above theirs with even higher fees. There's simply not enough room for everyone. If only any popular wallets and Bitcoin companies actually implemented SegWit it wouldn't be that bad, but an increase to 2MB blocks could be a much better short term help.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:10
0 conf is not safe because transactions can remain unconfirmed for many hours, days or get dropped from mempool entirely.

It doesn't require any special software or additional algorithms or anything that can get outdated. I believe that anybody that would understand 12-word wallet backups who would find 2 from a set of 3 of my plates should be able to figure out the full 12 word order in a coule minutes max.

I wanted to do the exact same thing for my backups a few months ago but quickly realised that for 12 word seeds. My solution to this was a bit unelegant - each of the 3 pieces contains randomly scrambled 8 words and full info on the correct order of words on the other 2 pieces.
So if you have just one slate, with 8 words of unknown positions and the full order key to the other 2 slates.
Example: 








The orderings unfortunately give away which 4 spots aren't used by words from this slate. So an attacker with one slate would have to bruteforce 4 missing words and the permutation of the known 8 (+15 bits) = 59 bits. I wouldn't hodl life savings on that, am I right it's not safe enough?
EDIT: I also forgot about the checksum thing, so it's like 55 bits to guess if you see 1 of 3 plates like mine?

That project looked very promising when announced last year. No blockchain, no crypto, transactions verified by a fully centralized server BUT it would be fully anonymous for users (just download a wallet app just like a Bitcoin wallet), allowing peer2peer transactions with zero fees (only a small 1-2% fee when you actually want to withdraw from the system to fiat cash.). Despite being backed by a local fiat it would be usable worldwide, like a stable, slightly inflationary altcoin. Would certainly find some uses.

For comparison someone should do the same thing with fiat money (M0). 
I'm far from having solid data, just some quick googling got me that the world's cold hard fiat cash supply (M0) should now be between $5T-5.5T, and that's roughly $700-$820 per person if divided equally.

Not as big as it may seem first, but still very positive. The Bitcoin economy won't move visibly because of this. Mostly it's just extra exposure for Bitcoin, millions of players will see it (if they also add it to games accessed from facebook). Extra visibility is always good, for Bitcoin to get truly mainstream it should be seen just everywhere and big companies accepting it add a lot of legitimacy to Bitcoin in the eyes of unbelievers / regular people.
But then may come the realization of truth, a big company like Zynga may reveal that only 0.001% of their paying users chose to pay with Bitcoin. This was the case with BigPoint games (10 players of their 30M playerbase paid with Bitcoin). And it may get caught by the media and made into horrible news.

The "revenue per visitor" metric can lead to very false results, for many reasons. Biggest one being plenty of visitors coming just to see if a bitcoin link got added or not. 
We have seen it happen before when a large porn website added Bitcoin payments, this fact was very hyped on Bitcoin forums and here, then shortly after they dropped Bitcoin acceptance just because they got less average $ gain per site visit!

Bitcoin value should be unaffected even if 5000 more altcoins get released. It's simply that all altcoins combined remain worth about 8-10% of bitcoin's market cap and doubling the number of altcoins in the last couple months haven't changed that % amount.
However it works the other way - the altcoins are generally very highly dependent on the bitcoins market price.

ELI5: Multisignature key generation - There are web wallets offering protection of funds by a 2 of 3 transaction where the user has 2 keys. This sounds awesome, as it requires no trust in   the service provider. But how/where are the priv keys generated so that neither party has access to the keys of the other at any point?
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:00:31
True, but most of those keys hold no coins - just look at what most transactions by the core client look like - coins from one address get split to 2 different ones, where a new one is change. When the user spends those coins again the entire balance (input) gets spent again into 2 other addresses.

One thing to always keep in mind: Do NOT panic sell. Cold storage a good % of your BTC and seal with "Do not open until 2017". Bitcoin use is not shrinking, just look at the metrics.

Cool, but this implementation doesn't look at the awaiting queue of unconfirmed transactions, which I think should be just as important. Without that the predictions won't be accurate during periods of heavily increased transaction numbers. 
I think a good algorithm should take into account the highest priority of transactions that hasn't made it into the last n blocks to estimate the fee. It also shouldn't be that hard to implement as Bitcoin Core should have the list of unconfirmed txs. Am I wrong somewhere?

Reusing is making multiple spends from one address, not having one address for many donations. And users could change their flair at will anyway.

That's dumb. Isn't it the biggest advantage of Bitcoin that you don't need any banks to use it? Only problems for them would be getting a significant supply of BTC and internet access across the country. I can imagine them getting around the first by starting their own altcoin instead (premined crap obv). I'm also curious if popular altcoin exchanges would add ISISCoin and what would be it's rate vs [PigCoin](

I think you got nothing to lose if you just start a new mycelium wallet with a completely new master key on a new phone and move all your coins from the old one by an actual on-chain transaction. Then all the attacker can do is view your old transaction history. Just don't make the mistake of recovering from the old paper backup on the new phone and continuing to use that, that old master key is no longer safe after somebody gets your old device.

Satoshi's coins entering the market shouldn't be anywhere as catastrophic as many think. In the long term that is. It's ~1.1M coins which is not a big % of the entire market cap.
Of course the panic market reaction could bring the price to low $100s for a short time but this scenario would be something the market should easily recover from. Assuming Satoshi wouldn't actually start dumping his hundreds of thousands btc into exchanges' orderbooks but just spend a couple hundred, panic buying would follow the flash crash.
Also, even full dump of satoshi's coins into the market would only be a *good* thing for Bitcoin - it'd be a 1-time event, then the threat would be no more, forever, and the arguments of unfair coin distribution would go away. It would also be the best time to invest your life's savings into cheap btc, an opportunity of a lifetime.

Can't find it in top150, it has to be changing really quickly.
Still, I've had much fun reading news articles after searching for: brexit bitcoin
Those go all the way, claiming brexit to be the reason for recent crash or the reason bitcoins gained 15% since the poll result was posted. But the coolest part is that I find Bitcoin to be very often referred to as "safe haven" assset among those articles. Way to go!

I got something for the BCH haters here, have a look and compare:
BTC: [
BCH: [
BTC and BCH should be VERY close when comparing this metric, but look, BTC has 7.97M coins sleeping for at least a year and BCH has 9.17M!  
Thinking it's insignificant? The difference is MORE than the amount of new coins mined since the hard fork! *(I know it doesn't have to be the new mined coins that just get hedl)*
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:11:24
More ways to cash out are nearly as important as more ways to get into Bitcoin. Even if ideally we want more people to buy and keep using btc, for a new user the knowledge that he can just go back to fiat easily and any time adds extra credibility to the system, making new users more likely to invest.
One of the biggest things that made me first put money into Bitcoin (other than research on that it's an actually brilliant system) was seeing the bid side on exchanges - massive bid walls meant there were constantly competing people to buy more coins, so the coins had to be worth *at least* what people were wanting to pay.

There are hundreds if not thousands shitcoins being traded on various exchanges. Even the most useless and scammy ones get some trading action. People (or bots) make bids on them just to speculate or make profits on small swings. I still wouldn't buy that but some would.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:36:16
It's those companies and of course the miners who decide what is Bitcoin and what's not. Most of websites accepting Bitcoin are actually using BitPay or Coinbase, so that's the coin we'll be able to spend after the fork. Conveniently it will be the one with uninterrupted mining after the fork, unlike the 1MBcoin which will likely have less hashrate than even BCH and absurdly high tx fees.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:18:37

In the linked article:


@_date: 2017-08-08 13:46:31
1MB is way too small, SegWit isn't enough of a help. Fees are going to stay high. The upgrade to 2MB is appropriate for the current demand, network load, and is small enough it shouldn't hurt decentralization. 
After the successful upgrade to 2x there won't be any reason to touch BCH, at least for a year.
Meanwhile, don't stop at this. Miners should already be negotiating future block size increases. We don't want a repeat of this crisis when 2MB blocks will get full in a year or two.

You shouldn't worry. Some bad actors which are very vocal on this particular forum are creating FUD and are preparing an attack on the stability of Bitcoin network. Fortunately a large majority of Bitcoin companies (including Bitpay/copay) and miners have come to a compromise solution to scaling of Bitcoin, so the coin is  supported by that majority is the one that will emerge 
Anyway, to be safe in case of any serious blockchain fork you should have your coins in a wallet in which you control the private keys. I haven't used the copay wallet, but if it allows you to access, view or export the private keys then you're perfectly safe when/if the fork comes.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:06:13
This looks like another attempt to create a minority coin, just like Bitcoin Cash. Nothing good can come out of it, except maybe some free coins again.
I believe Bitcoin users don't want that. Forks are just problems. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:19:44
Why would any sane person oppose 2x? The NY agreement was there for a reason and got such overwhelming support from miners and businesses. Why start another war just to cripple Bitcoin? What users would want high fees?

Looks they have been shorting bitcoin futures for the whole 2019, there must have been a lot of rekt on the way.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:19:39
Even earlier possibly, because if mempool is empty, BCH can't hardfork (they need a &gt;1MB block to start the fork).
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:13:08
No 750, bounced from 760 back to 800, sell pressure low so 850 is more likely than dropping below 750 at this point imho.

Well, if all who signalled switch then there's no other coin. Just lots of clueless Core nodes suddenly cut out from receiving new blocks.

This looks even stronger. 
Also note a different set of countries where it dominates.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:56:43
And that's a huge problem. I believe many/most of those who run Core aren't even aware they're doing an attack against the stability of the network and will find themselves on a chain suddenly cut off getting new blocks.

@_date: 2017-08-17 19:48:09
It's still a bad inferior altcoin BUT because bad actors want to attack the one Bitcoin and split it into two again, BTC has lost some value today and BCH went up by the same amount (in terms of USD per coin, not percentage).
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:11:41
Over 90% may have been the best we could hope for, but yes, that's what I call consensus. Of course there was opposition and it wasn't negligible, that's why it took so long. SegWit2x was a reasonable compromise so it got such a high support.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:01:07
The main issue here isn't the block size. It's all about who has power or even complete control over Bitcoin. It's more political than technical, those who oppose the 2MB increase want total centralization in hands of just 1 company (or aren't aware what it's really about).
But you ask about a technical reason. There's no technical downside other than that it requires a *hard fork*. And hard forks aren't easy to execute without causing much chaos, requiring an overwhelming support from both miners, businesses and users to go smoothly. Hard forks should generally be avoided if possible, unless they have near 100% support. This hard fork is necessary but definitely shouldn't be rushed.
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:10:13
Yeah, ideally it should be the market, mainly the users who should have the final say. But recent developments show it isn't going that way at all. Just one single company goes against the users, spreads disinformation and has a lot to gain from a complete takeover of Bitcoin. That's a much worse version of centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:47:12
Woah, 4 years ago! And those comments, so different than today's.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:06:39
Bitcoin USERS couldn't cast their votes anywhere but it's not a secret most of them want peace and stability and as little fees as possible. Creating forking altcoins isn't going to attract users - see BCH, it's not like people are rushing to adopt it, even if it's an improved scaled Bitcoin with no fees. Reason - it's not The One Bitcoin but one of many altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:16:13
Nothing bad can come out of having Bitmain get true competition. Let's hope it gets real. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:59:27
And what if most of Bitpay users agree with them and do want the scaling update to go as planned? So they can among other benefits enjoy one Bitcoin currency (with no need for stupid altcoins like BCH), one that has much lower fees and is not under full control of one company?
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:07:07
That while the "invalid" blocks form a strong, stable chain with the most cumulative work WILL destabilize the network and cause a lot of trouble for regular Bitcoin users. The amount of chaos that can result from this if Core won't update their client to be compatibile is hard to even imagine.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:49:18
You're right, it's extremely dangerous to attempt any hard fork without overwhelming consensus and enough time for all participants of the network to prepare for it. Chaos doesn't serve anybody, except some speculators who flip coins between forked chains. Proper communication is key, Bitpay failed at this, I'm waiting for them to correct themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:31:21
Bitpay was one of many companies that signed the New York Agreement - SegWit2x - a compromise solution for Bitcoin scaling. They are simply following that agreement and are explaining how to upgrade your node so it's ready for the incoming 2x fork (block size increase to 2MB, which was part of the SegWit2x agreement). 
The problem is not in bitpay but in a very vocal part of the community that want to oppose that agreement despite the fact it has already successfully activated with over 90% miner's support. 
The whole issue is much deeper but there's not a single place to get a good unbiased view on this. Every major Bitcoin related forum is heavily biased to one of 3(!) sides of the conflict.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:10:38
Miners certainly won't want to do any sort of attack, but they will likely use the overwhelming consensus which was signalled and agreed upon to do a smooth hard fork to sw2x with close to zero hashpower remaining on the old chain. Why would anybody want to stand against progress and attack them?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:39:52

Upvoting because we need all sides in the debate. But I don't see how a block size change matters at all to the 100,000 miners who don't run a full node. They only accept and do work units from their pools, they don't verify any transactions. Am I wrong here?

Yeah, exactly that,  and rising the maximum accepted size doesn't mean forcing the miners to mine such big blocks even if there were enough transactions (spam) waiting to be confirmed. Just like now with 1MB cap some miners decide it's more profitable for them to mine smaller blocks and reject some transactions to reduce their risk of not propagating their found block fast enough.

BTC started this rally, alts were behind for several hours. Then some started exploding, BCH the most. It may be an unpopular opinion, but the reason may be fear. Investors see current BTC unconfirmed transactions count (over 60k when BCH spiked) and tx fees rising to levels unseen for over a year, afraid of repeat of 2017 highs. BCH has tiny fees (we know, because nobody is using it), but may seem appealing as an fallback chain in case BTC becomes unusable again.

There's one thing that has bothered me for some time now - the Chinese minders and their crappy Chinese bandwidth making it so hard for them to propagate large blocks.

This doesn't make sense. Even if the vast majority of mining power comes from botnets, this doesn't affect the total supply of bitcoins and the usefulness of the entire technology, and coming from that the demand for bitcoins. Hence, there should be no effect on the market price, and no collapse.

Since early days of Bitcoin I was dreaming of a user friendly wallet that would show the owned outputs as coins and had an intuitive coin control feature allowing the user to select which of them he wants to spend. But as of now, most nontechnical Bitcoin users have no clue what they really got in their Bitcoin wallets...
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:10:14
That's cool! But what actually is the cause? Almost all blocks are still around 1.1MB because SegWit adoption is still not impressive. Then there are a few blocks above 1.5MB, they usually contain significantly less transactions than typical blocks, so they must be filled with some really fat transactions. How do those transactions with huge witness data look like? Could it be ones similar to this  ? Basically a ton of inputs and 1 or very few outputs?

I'm surprised and disappointed to see the the 19-24 young people less represented than the older 25-34 (I know this range is twice as wide, but it has more than double bitcoiners count).
And for the kids, teenagers, the numbers should really REALLY be higher!
They're the most tech-savvy, born in the Internet age. I'm old now, but remembering my 12-yo self, if I was 12 now, I'd get absolutely crazy about Bitcoin, more than my adult self ever got. I'd mine whatever shitcoin is the most profitable, exchange on the most advanced DEX, most likely learn to code and develop blockchain stuff, become an ultimate crypto-nerd.
Aren't teens into rebellion against authority these days? Don't they seek alternatives to what they can't get (like banking)? Don't they spend more time online than adults?

Time matters because there's competition in this market. Not only in crypto market. Even banks innovate and expand their markets. If people start leaving Bitcoin for alternatives the network effect may be gone and impossible to regain. Bitcoin shouldn't lose the first mover advantage and shouldn't scare off new users with massive fees.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:17:26
Why are you spreading this AML/KYC nonsense? What does it have to do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is permissionless innovation, any companies can join and operate on it, and enforce their rules on their customers.
Now a change in the protocol, like an increase of block size has (almost) NOTHING to do with the ability of users to transact using Bitcoin. Users should appreciate lower fees. Core devs could continue to develop quality code for Bitcoin with increased blocks, but 
I'd be much more worried about centralized mining, that's the point of failure when it comes to govs dropping AML/KYC requirements on cryptocurrencies. For the best protection against this threat, mining should be spread around the world evenly, and it should be easy to join and  provide a bit of hashrate to the network. 
The only disadvantage of *properely and safely executed* hardfork to 2x block size is higher cost of running a node. But nodes themselves aren't validating transactions, and the cost still wouldn't be any prohibitive.

The threat of satoshi's coins hitting the market has always been looming and traders should have always been pricing that risk in. With passing years many may think the risk of those coins moving got lower and lower, but that's not wise.

I was always strongly supporting the switch to a more consumer-friendly unit that's easy to calculate in mind - mBTC. But now I'm changing my mind. That's because Bitcoin is no longer consumer-friendly, and it can be more scary for newer users to realise the transaction fees can get as big as 1mBTC. A sad fact but Bitcoin is now pretty bad for small everyday purchases and excellent only for transfers of high value, where the normal BTC unit is perfectly fine.

It surely is important to everyone who has invested in *mining* hardware (or hashrate contracts). It shouldn't matter much to anyone else. 
Basically, the bitcoin mining rewards (new coins and transaction fees) are getting divided among the participants proportionally to the amount of computing power they provide. The growth of network's hashrate means the miner's hashing power is now a smaller % part of the total - so they're getting proportionally less bitcoins from their hardware.

Perhaps a more interesting thing in this story is that they now also accept Bitcoin in their integrated G2APAY payment solution that they're heavily promoting now. 
Unfortunately no Bitcoin logos on  yet, but it's already mentioned in their fee structure, top of the list with the very nice zero costs: 
I don't know what other sites use G2APAY as of now but it's looks like some nice potential for growth of Bitcoin acceptance worldwide.

Somewhat true but there's a conflict of interests - many bitcoin tippers want to give away their bits just to show the general public how easy it is to move value over the internet.

Sending too small amount won't make the Bitcoin transaction invalid, so it will go through. But if the transaction was a payment to a store accepting Bitcoin then you're in trouble - but that depends on how the payment processing service will handle it, not on the Bitcoin protocol.

I liked the name "millibits" for mBTC, because that should be straightforward, sounds like a name of a unit, clearly implies it's a smaller part of something.

Transaction priority is proportional to the amount of coins being sent and to the number of confirmations their last transaction has. It's an anti spam measure.

~2.5 million BTCs were mined at difficulty = 1. A  single mediocre CPU is able to find ~6 blocks per hour at difficulty 1.

I've been waiting for a site like this but I've been dreaming of a platform of exchange where players would buy and sell Event Tickets for BTC.
It would be revolutionary if you could use your bots to automate the process of tix to BTC trade:
* Sell tix on your website and let your bot/bots handle the delivery - when the bitcoin transaction gets enough confirmations just grant the bot credit
* Buy tix in game by the bots - players would just paste their bitcoin address in chat with the bot upon completing the trade.

2140 is irrelevant - Transaction fees in most blocks are already around 0.2-0.5 BTC and the halving that will happen in 2036 will drop the block reward to 0.390625 BTC.
Most likely the transaction fees will surpass the newly created bitcoins even earlier, perhaps even in 2024 (block reward 3.125 BTC).

Stuff like this dramatically decrease the bitcoin's price stability. If enough people follow strategies like this price can never be stable - MACD is going to cross bullish/bearish all the time and if it triggers massive buys/sells then we'll see huge price swings forever.

From my experience people simply **don't see** the [HELP] link in the bot's message. I think it would be enough to make it more visible - for example instead of a small [HELP] make it a fat **[What just happened?]** link (because that question from someone almost always follows a tip.)
The bitcointip help page  could also use a redesign to put information most relevant to people completely unfamiliar with Bitcoin on the top and clearly visible (because that "What is Bitcoin?" link hidden in the middle of a wall of text certainly gets missed by them.)

Alt coins need a reason to exist other than just "because they can". Right now people create these mostly *for* the miners to have something to mine for when mining bitcoins is no longer profitable for them. 
I believe it would be the best for the world's economy to have multiple competing currencies. Bitcoin is not perfect and can't realistically be the only one. New currencies will certainly emerge, hopefully with a different set of properties. Freedom is also a freedom to choose your currency.

1. Not possible because most of the coins in existence are not for sale. For example I wouldn't sell half of my coins
2. If a big entity or a lot of people wanted to buy just 1 million coins it would send the price to new record heights.
3. Absolutely no way mass emailing will get more than 0.001% recipients to actually buy btc...
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:38:40
That's not how a commodity market works. If they wanted to buy any large amount, for example 1 million BTC (less than 10% of all) they would boom the price to stratosphere instead. Then if they tried dumping them all could still leave the price higher than it started (think of other buyers who would want to buy BTC even more right because Facebook would be doing so).
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:11:28
Well, if they sent the coins to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDoNotSend2jsg (or another one like this) we would know for sure they can't use them. The Bitcoin community would also really love it if they did so.

Hypothetically a large company or bank could decide to support Bitcoin and offer to pay a fixed amount, for example $1000 per BTC.

It all makes a lot of sense to me - bitcoins are practically *CASH*, so wallets (addresses) cointain actual 'coins' of various denominations, instead of just balances. These 'coins' were originally minted in 50 or 25 BTC denominations and every transaction is an act of splitting/merging these 'coins' into different denominations and sending them to another wallet (address). 
But I'd really love to actually SEE my 'coins' (unspent transaction outputs) in my wallet software and be able to click one and spend exactly that one. The software should show the actual coins so that the concept of change being sent back to you won't confuse people. This would also educate people on why having thousands of 0.00000013 coins in their wallet is a bad thing.
So I'd also really love to have someone make a video explaining how it really works, to educate people. ALL the info out there (except the most technical pieces that normal users never read) doesn't touch the subject at all.

Driving this market down can only be done by someone who already has a huge lot of coins. But why would someone already deeply invested in BTC want to do it? 
Anybody else, no matter how much $$$ he got, will need to first BUY a lot, which will drive the price up. Then his dump would most likely not drop the price any lower than what he initially bought at.

Normally the longer blockchain gets retained and shorter ones get rejected by the network. If a country/region was completely disconnected for some time then it is most likely they had less mining power there so they produced less blocks during that time. It's harder to tell what would happen if a catastrophic event split the internet in 2 halves and those halves mined an equal number of blocks (assuming difficulty didn't change because that also counts).
But it's more important how transactions are relayed in such cases. I haven't heard of nodes being able to rebroadcast transactions from orphaned blocks but maybe the functionality is there.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:39:46
Don't send an amount this small without a fee, it will almost certainly never confirm. Also such a 'dust' amount is nearly completely useless to the receiving person as he won't be able to spend it in any way until he gets more BTC to pay transaction fee.

330 million users is absolutely unbelievable. This number most likely comes from the number of game accounts created, but their games are free to play and anyone can freely create as many accounts as he wants. As with most other MMO games I suppose lots of accounts were created for the purposes of botting and spamming.
But even if their actual playerbase is just like 5-10 million and the just a small % of them would ever pay for ingame things it's still a lot. A couple hundred thousand players exposed to the "**5% bonus when paying with Bitcoin**" is fantastic news indeed.

Yeah, his markup on these coins has truly gone astronomical. I remember when on a single brass 1BTC coin he was adding the equivalent of ~3$ - when BTC was worth $20 a 1BTC coin costed 1.15 BTC and when BTC was under $3 then they costed just above 2 BTC. Now the markup on a brass coin is like $35 and that's when you buy a roll of 50!

The only reason the volume that 2011 week was that high is the several absolutely enormous price swings, like from $20 to $30 to $10 to $20 again. During that time many traders, me included, have sold and bought their entire bankroll multiple times. That all added up to this volume.
This year and this week the market is much stronger - we're having much less price volatility at that same trade volume.

When a small Bitcoin exchange gets hacked we make headlines on mainstream websites. But the Bitcoin 2013 conference happens and there's a complete silence everywhere!
The problem is it was closed to media and general public. You're doing it wrong! It should have been widely advertised and open to all interested parties - I bet there would be many entrepreneurs interested in attending this, meeting the Bitcoin people and starting doing business with some Bitcoin companies.

1. The block being worked on is not fixed in stone, new transactions are being added to it as the work progresses. Changed block contents mean a completely different hash.
2. Look at hashes of current blocks, for example: 000000000000047bdc442ac73decbbfef636df4528763e47d727fb5af658ecf5 -- and see that even if the difficulty was trillions of times of what it is now the number of possible hashes would still be astronomical.
So even if SHA256 is not perfectly covering all outputs we have absolutely no reason to worry.

Capturing even 1% of all global trade that happens over the Internet would be a great success for Bitcoin. Don't aim too high too soon, replacing fiat totally shouldn't even be a long term goal - ideally in a healthy economy there should be many freely competing currencies. 
And don't worry about double-spending so much, there are ways around that. It should be enough that the  merchant checks the propagation of your transaction after a few seconds and if it's like 97% with no conflicting transactions seen and the transaction had a normal fee then chances for a successful double-spend are extremely thin.

UPDATE: I just made another large BTC withdrawal from mtgox, added the fee this time again. In a big stress I waited and after a full minute the transaction was sent to the network and now it's already confirmed. 
So gox probably isn't out of BTC. It's probably not a queue to get coins from cold storage either. So what's the problem here? I expected a long-ish wait as I heard they send out the no-fee transactions periodically in larger batches, but I got the tx hash for mine immediately so it can't be the case here.

* Number of people who had at least 0.01 BTC at any point of time (this excludes people who got some dust from free bitcoins websites and gave up at that point) - between 300k and 1M
* Number of active users - at least 1 transaction or trade on an exchange in the last 2 months - between 100k and 200k

This is BS. 
If you mined 2 blocks then you're already winning, and you gain close to nothing from having others waste some time. If you have 25% of network's hashing power then you'll mine on average 25% of new coins, no matter how many competing blocks you orphan. There is a minuscule advantage in holding the first mined block but it is trumped by the risk of having that block orphaned. Totally not worth it unless you have over 50% hashing power...  but then you can cause some serious trouble... however &gt;50% attacks are nothing new.

So their answer was pre-made for them and they just agreed in some degree. I think that if the pre-made answer was much better and mentioned that apart from speculative value much of Bitcoin's value comes from its unique properties - enabling users to send value instantly to anywhere in the world without any third parties, large fees, limitations and with no need to reveal you identity - most of them would agree.

How about we concentrate on increasing the worldwide Bitcoin adoption instead of pumping the bubble? 
Right now even $60 / BTC is likely too high given the actual use of Bitcoin in commerce. If, and only if Bitcoin gets mainstream the sky is the limit but until then wild speculation is not helping at all. Instead it increases volatility which can be a major factor stopping Bitcoin's wide adoption.

Honestly Bitmit is not much different than Ebay when it comes to searching cards, but the sorting is very very bugged (try sorting by price: highest first). This has to get fixed. Second thing I'd change here is adding a normal list view - to make browsing easier, to have more listings on screen at once and to require less scrolling down.

Transactions like this should get into a block without fee - it's small (500 bytes) and contains no outputs below a bitcent.
However I'm still surprised why these days transactions with even greatly excessive fee, like 0.1BTC can take many hours to get included - why wouldn't miners want free money?

This would be beyond awesome, especially if they took full advantage of the advantages of Bitcoin, but chances are extremely thin. I mean their link with PayPal is terrible, they didn't even make direct withdrawal possible. They were so afraid of any potential conflicts with any law and didn't want to be any kind of a money transfer business so they made the system very cumbersome. Also ridiculous 30% fees.

If you don't have any it's a good idea to buy one now. Even if the price drops in the next days it's more than likely that it will go much higher in the next months. 
BTW, you should drop the psychological barrier of "a bitcoin" - there's nothing significant about having 1BTC and not for example 1.17BTC or 0.964BTC. That's also why the community is now discussing a switch to a different unit - most likely millibitcoins (mBTC = 0.001 BTC). So even if the price goes over $100 you should think about buying "a few hundred millibitcoins" :)

Services allowing merchants to get paid in their fiat of choice while customers pay in btc are a huge boost to Bitcoin adoption rate and allow us to spend our bitcoins in many more places.

The psychological effect can be huge, I've learned that myself.

Arbitrage is hard or not worth doing because fiat currencies at various exchanges aren't actually worth the same. For example 1 USD at BTC-e is worth more than 1 USD at mtgox. Worth more because it often buys more BTC. And the time it takes to move fiat from/to the exchanges can be extremely long, like a full week if you're lucky, and in that time bitcoin price can swing up and down by 50-300% making that 10% arbitrage a bad joke.

Early adopters likely got way less coins than many think. Following the 2011 'bubble' there have been massive sell-offs, which over a couple months caused the price to drop from $20's to $2.
