I said price of gold dropped in the OP, which is why its a great time to invest in it.  Also during strong inflation buying soft paper assets like stock makes no sense to me.  Precious metals are hard assets - why should I diversify and treat bitcoin the same?

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:02

I cant be bothered to respond to someone who is so flagrantly biased that they don't want an honest discussion.  I probably own more Bitcoin than you do, and I probably have mined more Bitcoin you ever will.  I'm just astonished I guess at the fanboyism.  Leads to shill posts like this and reminds me of Sony vs Xbox shit I read years ago.  
What I will say is that your vague, and fanboy argument about bandwagoning can apply to literally any alt-coin.  How many dozens of alt-coins have died already?  Dozens that were made and died mere months after bitcoins inception.  Come on now.  Your a later adopter to Bitcoin I get it, but you sadly are oblivious to its past or crypto's past in general.  You arent a cryptocurrency fan in the slightest.

That implies Bitcoin is as equal at storing wealth as bullion, but we all know bullion has a hard floor it can't afford to drop below (cost of production).  Bitcoin can be shut down by governments and bank men.  Lok at how manyt exchange were taken down and people lost it all.  Granted if I can be shown that bitcoin arent such a scary store of wealth maybe I will buy some from this mt. Gox

Sure, gold gets manipulated and crashed so hard that its value falls below cost of production and no new gold enters the market forcing scarcity to raise the price due to supply not growing any longer.
Not sure what you meant by this
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:15:26
Ok so this thread has convinced me to obtain SOME bitcoin for my safety against my evil government.  I wont disclose how much bitcoin I will obtain but its going to be not an small amt
with that being said what about these litecoins I hear of?  something about they are undervalued and a good buy ?
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:35:07
You dont.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:28:40
Yeah CampBX!
Also, I use CampBX to buy my bitcoins.  Lower fees, lower commission, takes Dwolla.  However, with Dwolla, the time it takes you money to show up after transfer initiated can be up to eight hours for some people.  It took my transfer 6 hours on a Saturday once.  I want CampBX to take Litecoins, since I also own and mine/buy Litecoin as well and I really fucking hate using a website like BTC-E for anything.
I hope more people show up to CampBX.  Its nice man.  Real nice.  That google authentication is legit too.  I would also like to add I wish I had known about the comission referrals.  Please feel free to us my affiliate link as well.

Who the fuck is "we"?  Take your leftist horseshit and shove it.  The state already taxed me once with my income tax, and again when I buy anything via sales tax.  Bitcoin is the answer to excessive taxation.  The OP is well within his right to get the State to stop digging into his pockets to fund bailing out bankers who risk it all and beg for money from the State so they dont ruin the State.

Well, so you don't think in a year or twos time, after ASICs have completely shut out people like myself from mining Bitcoin, that they won't look to an alt-coin, perhaps Litecoin?  Litecoin is more ASIC resistant and GPU friendly, though developing an ASIC is possible but extremely costly compared to potential gain.  You don't think Bitpay won't try to work in support for alt-coins when/if alt-coin trading takes off after GOX adoption?
The network is small now, but damn were talking about Bitcoin which is also extremely young.  I wish reddit wasn't such a shitty way to have a forum discussion, but I want to come back to this when MTGOX starts trading Litecoins as well as a couple of other Alt-Coins (that they havent announced but will most likely be PPC and NVC, with some others Im sure).  If they are too be believed, probably within 6 weeks we'll have alt-coin trading and arbitrage on the largest exchange here soon.  Too bad I wont use MTGOX personally.

@_date: 2013-04-18 18:01:13










All of this is blatant derailment and hyperbole.  There is no substantive argument to be found in these talking points.


Litecoin is as secure as Bitcoin, it just comes to the save security conclusion differently - but ultimately - at the same pace. 
 No one should be told "man up and handle his arguments" when they amount to as much noise and he can type with no substance.  I know the downvote brigade has caught wind of the thread, so soon anything I say articulate or as shitty as what he typed - will be meaningless anyways.

So In economics and business, a network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people. When network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it.[1]
The classic example is the telephone. The more people own telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner. This creates a positive externality because a user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users, but does so in any case. Online social networks work in the same way, with sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ becoming more useful as more users join.
From that, its hard for me to find out what you are saying or want to convey.  Im not in the business of assuming what you meant, either you think any alt-coin is bad for bitcoin, or the opposite.  Which is it?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:43
