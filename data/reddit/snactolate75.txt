Having said that, i am not there to experience what is happening, and my objective opinion is skewed by lack of information and my own upbringing.

Inflation is caused by central banks and interest rates. Inflation is basically the value of money going down and the value of goods and services going up. So, we have to look at the underlying causes of inflation before we look at what form of money we use. Either could cause inflation if, for instance, everyone has access to the same amount of money causing the value of said money to lose its power. Every great civilization has been destroyed when the population figured out how to be a utopia. Because utopias dont work. EVERYTHING in the universe is based on struggle and entropy. We have to embrace that fact or we all suffer. In closing, adversity is the mother of progress, without adversity we face stagnation.

Oh my point lol sorry, btc, is not yet controlled by central banks. Has no interest rate yet, and is a form of money that flows across borders. USD is stable, and Venezuela has opportunity to turn from its native currency and take the power away frombthe government. The way to fight, in my mind, is to defund.
