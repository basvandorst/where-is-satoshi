I used cex.io, it’s great. Some of the NZ or Aus ‘exchanges’ have terrible conversion rates

Thanks! If I just use the seed generated by a mobile wallet such as Green and store it physically before deleting the app, that should be fairly safe provided my phone is secure at present?

People were obviously mining btc when it was much cheaper than today, if difficulty reduces along with the price then surely mining is still profitable for the majority?

It’s not worth mining bitcoin on a PC anymore, maybe there’s some coins you could mine profitably and convert to BTC

I do DCA but will buy more frequently during price dips - for instance I put a lot more in yesterday because of the dip. I believe buying the dip is far more effective than simply putting X amount in every Y days

I’m from NZ and use cex.io to buy then send to wallet. The NZ exchanges seem to have ridiculous conversion rates from memory

Gotcha, that makes sense. I noticed that you can store a backup phrase to recover the HW wallet... guessing this should be a physical backup or else we have the same issue

Same concept as the eftpos system going down I guess. Cash is always useful as a backup

It probably won’t take your landlord very long to discover the amount of electricity you’re using...

Question, is the lightning network as secure as the POW blockchain?

The information may be public, but how many people actually know about this? Perhaps a decent percentage of the western world has heard of Bitcoin, but how many of those actually know what it is and how it works? I would say not even 1-5%. Half the people that fomo’d in and forgot about it probably don’t even know.

It appears you’ve assumed the total supply of bitcoin halves every 4 years to get your 19% annual price increase.... only the block reward halves (a very small percentage on top of the existing supply). 
This maths is redundant anyway because you  assumed demand stays the same, when it is almost certain it will not.

Many people bought the dip all the way from 20k to 3k, ‘Tis the nature of the game.
