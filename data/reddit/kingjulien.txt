In a lot of countries, transferring crypto is a lot easier than transferring $ from your bank account. There's no/barely any clearing time, you just need a single address, etc.

Eh… they have things like small cap indexes, emerging markets indexes, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:45:45
Did not see it, but the broad market has only been trending down for a bit over a week.  During the crash you're referring to, BTC *was* the crypto market. Also, my comment had no timeframe intentionally - maybe it recovers tomorrow, maybe it's in two years, but I'm confident that it will eventually do so.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:28:02
Do you know how math works? For example, [bitcoinity]( uses mBTC. Having one mBTC be worth $13.50 is not confusing for the average person. At some point, we might move to micro BTC.

No, I'm not. I'm talking about that article. See other comments in this thread.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:41:45
That seems possible. I personally haven't traded fiat &gt; crypto in years (though I have done plenty of the other direction). If you ban it you're just going to end up with a black market.

Bitcoin crashes multiple times per year. It's always been this way. It'll probably dive a few more times and then start climbing again before going parabolic, making a few people rich, and repeating the whole cycle.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:36:02
That article is incorrect. The government asked for some tax documents from the exchanges, and indicated that they might take steps to restrict minors from registering. There is no indiciation that they are planning on banning crypto trading.

I keep having to tell myself this about Bitcoin, too. I bought in between $11 and $35 and sold percentages of my holdings at $250, $1200, $800, $1000. I made a killing. But it's so tough to shake the fact that if I had just held, I'd have well over half a million dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:10:17


There's a few outliers, but I really doubt many people are doing this.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:08:08
Hey, you made over 200% profit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:14:23


Yup. Bought at $11, sold 10% or so every big spike all the way up to $1200. Price cratered, I forgot about them until a couple years later, where I sold most of the remainder at about $1,000.
There's no way I would have held that whole time. I had 30 or so at the beginning... when it hit $1200 I would have had $32,000, off like a $300 investment. If you don't sell after a 1000x return, you're an idiot. I made about $35,000 profit, which is pretty damn good all up.
But it sucks, because they would have been over $500,000 now.

Well, no, not really.  Zimbabwe had monetary issues the US has never had, for example.  Kenya uses some sort of digital currency already.  In the US, the dollar is working just fine (inflation is at almost 0%, it's readily available, etc), so it's much less likely that people will replace it willingly.

A doctorate is way different than an undergrad degree.  I'd never have the job I have now if I had no degree, and my degree was in liberal arts, and none of the classes I took directly applied to a job.  Yet I still gained a lot of useful skills.

Sure, it doesn't guarantee you a job.  But go ahead and try to get a job *without* a college degree.  Those same friends will be waiting tables literally forever - if they're lucky.
By the way, historically liberal arts majors catch up in salary to engineers by around age 40.

In journalism, you're supposed to have three confirmations before going to print.  As far as I can tell, she only had the one, which has been revoked. Really big fuckup on the editor's part, IMO - this should never have been printed.
It's possible they have two further confirmations that were off-the-record, but I strongly doubt it.
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:36:46


I've always disagreed with this.  I think it's an amazing protocol useful for things like international industry and certain types of purchases.  I don't think it's ever going to *replace* fiat, with the exception of 3rd world countries with runaway monetary problems.
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:26:25
A few things here:
* One of the key results of a college education is learning how to do things like do research, think critically, and communicate well.  These skills never 'fade away.' The facts you learn are mostly a side effect of learning those skills, and forgetting them isn't a big deal.
* You may prefer a high school student that's motivated, but most employers don't.  They use a college degree as a bare minimum for any kind of job posting.  Without that, you're shut out of so many jobs - it's not fair, but it's how it works.
* When looking at a high school grad, I'd ask myself "why didn't this person go to college." In all likelihood, they've also been bumming around waiting tables for four years - *and* they don't have a degree. Next applicant, please.
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:55:28
I can't find the study but the methodology was pretty sound.  They essentially just looked at salaries around the US and compared it to education level, then factored for total years in the workforce.  The people without college degrees were doing really badly.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:31:55
Oh.  You said "this is a very critical concept," meaning that it's overly-critical; cynical.  I think you meant to say "this is a very crucial concept" thus the misunderstanding.  I wasn't familiar with those examples (I've been ignoring most of the bitcoin scam drama).
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:24:57
I'm subscribed to like 200 subs...
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:56:09
It actually doesn't.  Comparing the wages of those without degrees to those with degrees in the US on average, the average cost of *not* getting a degree is actually **$500,000** over a lifetime.
A degree doesn't guarantee you a job, but it will in all likelihood prevent you from getting completely fucked.  A liberal arts degree for $30,000 is still a pretty good deal when you realize it's a requirement for practically every entry-level position.

She didn't actively commit war against the United States and she didn't aid their enemy. Treason is defined in the constitution *specifically* so that charges like the one you're trying to claim can't be made. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:35:33
She was never under investigation for treason; first of all. Secondly, there were two views of the allegations: first, that it wasn't that big of a deal and was overshadowing the real election issues; and the conservative view that it was a major issue. I didn't read the WaPo stories on this, but the NYT did a very good job of portraying both sides. Conservatives who make the claim that anything but the second view is biased are simply allowing their own opinion to overshadow everything else.

I don't think you understand Nano at all. It's completely decentralized. The only issue is the lack of incentive to run a full node, but there are already hundreds of nodes, and in the future most merchants will be running their own node to speed up transactions and protect against double-spends.

It's also quite hard to get a bank account. The "Africa problem" was one of the things that convinced me to hold since getting into Bitcoin seven years ago.

Yikes, I'm a bit concerned you're so misled about how that works. If we theoretically increase the block generation from every ten minutes to every one minute... you now need 60 confirmations instead of 6 for the same security. It does nothing.
The difficulty adjusts every two weeks to average ten minute block times. If they're higher or lower than that, it'll be corrected at the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:32:07


Plenty of other coins have a working and flawless solution, theoretically. None of them have a 'proven' solution simply because none of them have been hit by Bitcoin's tx volume yet. I think Stellar Lumens is the closest to competing to LN on its own turf. You could also include Nano, but it's got a lot of concerns that need real-world testing to address.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:20:05
Good point. Don't know why the article didn't elaborate:


@_date: 2018-02-27 21:36:01
Nano isn’t nearly as secure as Bitcoin, but it’s arguably comparable to LN.

That wasn’t actually the issue. I took off for South America with money I’d saved and wasn’t working at the time, went over budget, and had to sell some coin to get a flight. I definitely don’t regret that trip, but I think I could have left a month or two earlier and still had savings left. 
I traveled for 15 months and had the experience of a lifetime, which is worth more than the money, really. But you can have your cake and eat it too.

Not even that; it's just good for wiring money internationally in general. Western Union charges 7%, for example - Bitcoin is a hell of a lot cheaper if you or the recipient doesn't have a bank account.
That's one of the premises of Stellar - giving access to very low fee remittances to underserved (poor) populations.

Monero, actually, has been the most stable. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:36:57
Honestly, I think you’ll be happy you bought in the mid-term (the next year or so). LN is getting closer and closer and no real news has affected the market - it’s not like we found a flaw in the protocol or something.

Bitcoin was never really intended for Americans - but yeah, Silk Road knockoffs are fucking huge in the US. The biggest market there is drug users.

Eh, you’re a lot better off than I am, though, although I have a far higher net worth than the average person under 40 or so. I had, at the high point, about 35-40 BTC, purchased between $11-200 starting in 2011. I took a lot of profit when it hit $1200, which I felt smart about for years, and had to sell off quite a lot in 2016-2017 just to pay expenses. I still have a fair bit left, but I’ll probably regret those last few sales for a long time, which would have been avoided had I just budgeted better.

ASIC miners are not that easy to develop. I remember when they just got going, it was a few million just to get the first ones designed, and it took a couple years - I was mining in 2011 and we knew ASICs were coming, but it was a long time before any of them were online.

Ethereum in its current form can't really scale past about 15 transactions per second, while you'd need thousands per second to truly act as a global P2P currency. It's currently enough, but its a huge problem looking forward (exactly like Bitcoin). It's not something you can solve just by increasing the block size.

Stellar is a POS system founded in 2014, so four years, with over a $6 billion market cap.


Um, we do have a pretty good idea. These coins are worth billions - that's a damn big bug bounty for someone that could break the system.

Interesting. I've been in this space since Bitcoin was $10, but I never found it particularly complex compared to, say, Ethereum. I've made purchases with Bitcoin, I've used it as an investment vehicle, I've paid for sushi with it... 
I will admit that I have the luxury of being a lot less phased by seeing my holdings drop by double digit percentages, since I'm up so much even compared to this time last year, let alone 2011. But I don't think this is the dotcom bubble. There wasn't nearly enough money invested yet. We'll see that bubble in a few years when some of these companies start showing working products and results.

There wasn't billions rushing in. I've seen estimates at a few hundred million, total. Don't conflate market cap with actual money invested.

Like I said, it’s the lack of a central bank. Australia, the uk, etc have one, so it’s way easier to set up a payment network.

I have bank accounts in the US and in Australia. The last time I wired money between them, I paid a $28 transfer fee, got a bad exchange rate, and it took 5 days. International transfers are *not* easy.

They get to invest your money and earn a return. Same incentive as a normal savings account that would have free transfers and ATMs as a service. I imagine the first bank to offer free international transfers will scoop up a lot of customers.
The stellar network fee is like $0.00002. Add that to the LN fee and any slippage and you're still well under a cent in net cost for an international transfer. They'll need some servers on the backend, but that's not a lot of cost for the bank just to offer this for free, with a lot of upside.

SWIFT is expensive and slow. I worked in a company that used it heavily for a few years. The error checking we had to do cost millions per year, because x% of every transaction was wrong - one side would have one amount and the other a different amount in their system. Stellar doesn’t have errors, and it transfers in 4 seconds. 
The other big draw is liquidity. You can’t really transfer Mexican pesos to, say, Turkish lira without high fees because there’s no channel. Stellars network allows you to do this. Swift is sort of ok for eur &gt; usd, but really bad at smaller currencies.

By that, I assume you mean "when BTC is the only currency." That doesn't have to happen.
I'm going to use Stellar (XLM) as an example, because it exists today and works, but there's multiple ways you can do the following:
Sean has dollars, pounds, or Bitcoin (doesn't matter), and needs to send you $5 worth. Let's say he has Bitcoin - but you want dollars.
Sean opens up his Lightning app and sends $5 to an address provided by your bank (more on this in a minute). Stellar and Bitcoin's Lightning Networks will be connected by roughly December, so let's assume that's happened. The Bitcoin is exchanged via a smart contract onto Stellar's network, quickly routed to your bank, which is a Stellar anchor, and shows up in your account. You don't need to log in to any exchange.
This technology already exists. LN is here on Bitcoin, it's in beta on Stellar, and Stellar has atomically swapped currencies for years, and has fiat anchors acting as banks in multiple countries. Is YOUR bank acting as a Stellar anchor yet? Doubtful, but we're still early. The point is that the infrastructure exists already for this.
@_date: 2018-07-17 03:04:51
* Many countries *don't* have this (the US, for example)
* What if Sean's bank account is based in Great Britain? Then this transfer could cost $5 + $6 in fees + a bad exchange rate conversion (another 5% or so)

No.  You don't understand.


This is *not* harmful.  Words aren't harmful.  If he can prove that harm resulted from that statement, then he has a case.  For instance, if he ran a business, his customers saw this forum post and stopped going, and his business went under as a result, he might have a case.


Might be true, we'll probably find out in the next couple of weeks, but the second point is the important one.


How is harm going to result from his name being given to the police?  Also, do you know how many Kevins there are?  From another site: "The statement(s) alleged to be defamatory must also have been published to at least one other person (other than the subject of the statement) and must be "of and concerning" the plaintiff. That is, those hearing or reading the statement must identify it specifically with the plaintiff."  No one reading that forum post can identify it with the real person, except the police officers.
To prove libel, you need to show that there was measurable harm from the statement.  He's never going to prove that.  You could just as easily turn this around: there's plenty of forum trolls on that site making up things about MagicalTux.  His name is actually connected to the real person and to his business, he'd have a better case, but he'd still have to be retarded to sue for libel.

You gotta remember how many people are mining (unprofitably) with CPUs, or with nvidia cards, or with stuff they already had or cards they found off craigslist.  AMD probably got a bit of a profit increase, yeah, but what I'm saying is, don't invest in AMD stock because of bitcoin.

I hadn't realized he released his identity.  That was stupid of him... You might be right from a technical standpoint, he might have a case.  However, I work as a journalist, and I often get yelled at by stupid people who are threatening to sue (for all sorts of things, including libel).  The thing is, free speech is always held to be more important.  I've never even heard of anyone being successfully sued for libel.

@_date: 2011-06-22 16:33:50
I drew the same conclusion as you in another thread, especially since MagicalTux said later in the thread that he logged in and placed the buy order (implying that it was before the hacker), and got downvoted to hell.  I think Kevin was acting really suspiciously but the bitcoin community doesn't seem to agree.

A CPU at full power consumes way more energy than one that is idle.  I know you're not paying for it, but most people don't seem to understand this.  I get 22 mh/s on my CPU and I don't run them even though I'm mining on the GPU, because the energy cost would be so high.
@_date: 2011-06-11 02:38:16
If you want the card anyway, go for it.  Honestly though, I wouldn't invest in a bunch of hardware just for mining, unless you can spare the money.  It's a fun hobby, but not really that profitable.
@_date: 2011-06-10 07:59:05
To use a simple analogy, you can chop down a forest with one guy with a big saw (nvidia) or a couple guys with little saws (ATI) in the same time, it just so happens that when you're using it for something weird like mining, the little guys work better.  It's something to do with the architecture approach - they each chose a different strategy to get the same result, but ATI's is 2x faster at mining.

From wiki: "in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement."
He's not going to prove that second point since his real name *isn't even on the fucking forum*.  If this was true, every internet troll on a WoW forum could go around suing for libel.  It's very difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that harm was caused.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:01:29
This.  I'm mining because I wanted a new graphics card anyway, so this way I can just put it in the garage til it's paid off.  If your goal is to get rich quick, personally I think you're a lot better off buying some coins, with less of a gamble and a lot less time spent.

A and B are not exclusive.  I suppose I ignored the second part of your question, but if there's mass investment the value will rise - that's what raises bitcoin value.  However, the value could go up and it could still be unprofitable to mine.

It will still pay off, even taking a difficulty increase into account, for the near future.  If the price crashes (below $10 or so), it will cease to be profitable for most, but right now you can pay off your hardware.
That said, you're not going to get rich mining.  You'll probably be able to pay for a graphics card, but that's about it.
@_date: 2011-06-13 00:03:59

Most of the alt coins come with compromises. Monero is the closest to being a “true” bitcoin competitor, but it has even worse fee issues than BTC does. Also, bitcoin can incorporate most advances into its code, if needed. 
I think there’s room for tokens that do other things, but as a pure store of value/ peer to peer currency, I don’t think bitcoin will be replaced, and the more research I do the more I become convinced of this.

I won't take that bet.  When I think "mining profitability," I think max: 2 months or so.  I bought a card about a week ago for $145 and honestly I'll consider it a job well done if I just manage to pay it off.
@_date: 2011-06-11 17:44:06
Yeah, they do, but that's what's driving the price up so high.  Relatively few people are investing a lot of money they can't spare into bitcoins.  It's mostly people investing a bit of spare change, $50 or $100, just in case it blows up.  What's happening is more and more people are hearing about BTC and investing a little bit of money in it, just in case, and leaving it there.  The "panic" everyone's afraid of isn't going to happen, because most people aren't going to panic, they were prepared to lose their investment.

No.  Total network hashrate: 7215 GH/s.  Let's assume the average card puts out 200 Mh/s (no one is buying anything worse than that just for mining).  7215000/200 = ~36,000 card sold.  Even if you assume ALL of those cards were purchased just for mining (and at least half of them were likely either bought used or already owned for gaming), that's a completely insignificant amount of cards compared to the gamer market. If we assume each card was ~$200 (a little steep, actually, for a 200 mH/s card), that's only $7,200,000.  That's *total volume sold*, as in, it's including the cost to build the card, as well as profits.  AMD's *total profits* for just the first quarter of this year were $520,000,000.
tl;dr Bitcoins are getting some attention, but don't kid yourself.

I'd say buying bitcoins is more of a risk, though.  There's no way to tell whether the market will go way up or way down - at least if you have the hardware, you can sell that off or use it.  If you invested the same amount into MtGox you could lose everything tomorrow.

I know, i read those, but coinbase has two purchasing methods: one, when they have bitcoins on hand, they sell you btc at the price when you submitted payment. There were a ton of complaints that they kept running out, so they added a second option - if they are out of btc, you can still buy and they will give you coins at market price when your $ transfer clears.

This is overly simplistic.  Let's say that there's a huge increase in confidence that bitcoin WILL be picked up - i.e.; amazon switches to only accepting bitcoin.  The market will quickly adapt to this news, and the confidence will be priced in.

They can't do that because no one would accept the client.  You're not understanding my point... for example, let's say a new feature would greatly benefit bitcoin.  That new feature can be built into the next version of the client, and slowly becomes available as the nodes switch over.

" In contrast, social contract theorists reason that the free choice to remain a member of society—not birth and not locale—is what binds each member of society to the contract's terms.  In this sense, human beings “volunteer” to belong to society simply because it is rational and in one's self-interest to do so (Lessnoff, 1986).  Laws—whether penal or non-penal—are non-coercive in that, once children have observed society and matured, they can choose as adults to stay or to leave.  The choice to stay is what binds a citizen to the social contract and to abide by its terms.  This is how the “contract” emerges, as has been argued at least as early in intellectual history by Plato (1981).  In Crito, Socrates maintained that a decision to remain in society confers legitimacy to the social contract and imposes its obligations upon a citizen; a decision to leave society signals illegitimacy and, although relieved of its obligations, a citizen now must submit to suffer the consequences of this decision or to leave society."

So if I have a great idea, how do I get the capital to start a business and enact it if no one will loan me money? Is that what you're saying? What I'm saying is that interest rates will be way too high in a deflationary economy (interest rates from banks), dampening any new business or investment opportunity.

Having a currency like bitcoin be deflationary is not an issue, since it is unlikely to ever be the only form of currency in a country.  However, institutionalized deflation causes serious issues, because investment capital cannot flow properly.  If just by holding my money I get 4% annual return, why would I loan you money at 3% so you can start a business?  Well, you argue, just loan the money at 8% interest to make up the difference.  However, this hurts the business owner, since they are not benefiting from deflation since they have invested their money in their business and have a really high interest rate on their loan.  As such, less people take risks on loan, and there is less innovation.  In addition, if there is an economic downturn, you're *really* fucked, since ultra-low rates become impossible to get, and no one will have that incentive to innovate.
I don't think it's unequivocally a bad thing, but I cannot see how a fully deflationary economy could sustainably function.

I disagree with you there, though, because included in the price is the fundamentals (actual transactions) *AND*, the piece everyone forgets about, the market confidence in *FUTURE* value.  That second part is what's been fueling the bubble - bitcoin started making the news, a bunch of old hats checked back in and saw how far the infrastructure had come in a couple years, and the confidence in widespread adroption that inspired fueled a big price increase.
I don't picture it going below about $90.

No, that's not the case.  If they have coins in stock, you get the former.  If they do *not* have coins in stock, they provide an "alternate" option, which is the latter.  Apparently people aren't understanding which one they're doing when they buy, but the site itself is quite clear.
Until recently, they simply told you that they had no coins in stock and you couldn't buy, and people were complaining so they offered an "alternate" option.

Look, you really should have read up on investing before dumping a lot of money into something:
* The worst time to sell is at the bottom of a big drop, which is what you seem to be looking to do
* The worst time to buy is at an all-time high, which is when people are more likely to buy
Look, what changed since you bought your coins - nothing, except the price dropped.  Did you buy them because you thought they'd be adopted a few years down the road?  If that's still the case, then who cares what they're trading for in the next month or even year.  In the long run, you'll be getting a deal at $260.

I've been wondering what will happen with Bitcoin begins to see popularity in India, Japan, etc - big countries that haven't yet seen the popularity surge due to the language barrier.  It already happened in Russia.

Have you ever taken a macroeconomics class? The reason the Fed lowers interest rates during a recession is to make it easier for people to get capital, growing the economy.  If you have a baseline 4% interest from deflation, you have a permanent drain on our GDP.
Excess debt is a problem.  A small amount of debt for a successful business venture is smart.  Most companies take on debt at some point, for good reason - it's how you get growth.  Debt enables our economy to run.
I mean, I'm invested in Bitcoin pretty heavily at the moment.  I just don't think it's smart to replace the US dollar with it.

Because it takes so fucking long to transfer money.  I put a bunch in dwolla the other day for just this kind of crash and I can't access it til tomorrow.

If it stays at $100 ill be pretty happy.

Probably because of dwolla being seized.

That just isn't true.  Let's say I have $200,000.  I see an opportunity to buy a good building in a good location for my small business, total operating costs to open will be $1 million.  I take out an $1 mil loan at 4% interest in our current economy with my down payment.  In the deflationary economy, I'm stuck between taking out a loan with an 8% interest (which could easily eat my profit margin, making me decide not to make the investment), or... what, waiting 30 years until my $200,000 becomes one million?
Also, saying that *removing what enables half of our economy* is not a problem is absurd.

I gotta admit, it's really fucking unnerving to see 4-digit losses in just minutes, but then I remember that I bought in around $19/each and that I really believe this technology will succeed.

This was pretty much my experience as well, although I suspect I was playing with less bitcoins than you (and I got out seconds before the exchange went down @ $120).  I have a big buy order sitting slightly below $30... I'm guessing that it'll get fulfilled sometime in the next few days.

You clearly have no idea what a fundamental is

Idk man, i made like 500% profit... there is always money to be made in a bubble
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:20
Well, not exactly.  Let's say the dramatic price increases slow down and the technology catches up, leading to broader adoption... the price will not drop blow where it is now ever again.
I think it's a bubble, but a very early stage of a bubble... there's a fuckton of money to be made between now and when it really pops.

There's a really great New Yorker article on this from 2011, the evidence points strongly to a single person located in Britain.

I mean... i havent been charged by my bank for anything ever, and its federally insured. It sounds like you have a worse deal, paying $3 every time you need to send a check

Is blockchain.info still fairly safe?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:18:28
Check bitsfloor, price seems to be sticking around $150 for now.  I bet once the lag clears everyone will buy and it'll rocket back up.  Wish I had some damn USD in the system.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:10:01
Don't be greedy.... 200 coins is still pretty damn good right now.

The article was about bubbles in general, not about bitcoins.  She didn't mention bitcoins once.
@_date: 2013-03-12 17:24:25
This would make sense if Bitcoin were being used as a currency, but measuring it against the USD makes more sense as the USD is a "stable" indicator of value.  I don't think there's any other currency in the world that fluctuates like BTC does.
