Sorry to be blunt, but you're an idiot.
You are not a daytrader but a gambler. If the price falls $30, you don't double your position in order to make back the money you lost, you should have held steady or cut your losses. You are down $100k, and you're average is over $600+ per coin. Currently, it's at $330. Trying to catch an investment whether it be a stock or bitcoin or gold at it's bottom is like trying to catch a knife. You WILL cut yourself and that is exactly what you have done.
First thing you need to do is, tell your family. They deserve the right to know, but explain to them the situation. If they decide to keep the coins, then great. Slowly sell them off as the price increases in order to make sure the end loss is not too high. If they are scared and want to liquidate everything, make sure they understand they are losing $100k that they can never get back.

Bitcoin was an "ass penny" at one point too....

You know the old saying:
"First there are innovators, then there are imitators, and then there are idiots."
Bitcoin is the innovator, LTC and Doge are the imitators, and the rest like 42 Coin, Ron Paul coin and other crap are the idiots.

Technically 25 Doge is $0.024.

The same was said by countless when Bitcoin first came out.

You literally just lost over quarter of a million dollars. I am so sorry for you man. I felt the same way since I have a bitcoin wallet I can't get into!

Iam suprised nobody has bought out the graphics cards or a 40" 4k TV or something....

Yes, there will be more Dogecoins than Bitcoins. 100 billion compared to 21 million. There will also be an additional 10k reward for each block past 600k in order to curb any destroyed dogecoins. 
It's safe to assume that Dogecoin will be around 100 BILLION coins at any given time. If Dogecoin eventually gets a $10 BILLION marketcap, that is $0.10/coin. Currently you can buy around 1 MILLION coins for $1000. So that $1000 investment can turn into $100k. 
Granted, it all depends on whether or not you believe Dogecoin can get a $10 BILLION marketcap.

Bitcoin's marketcap came crashing down due to the Mt. Gox fiasco. It's marketcap has been sitting north of $10BIL, almost $12BIL until recently.

How easy is it to cash out of bitcoin?

Way back in the day when I had a 5870 and a GTX 260 in my computers I mined around 1000 coins and I sold 980ish to someone for $75, back then, that was a lot of money to me. I should have the other 10-12 coins on a wallet on a corrupted HDD (500GB Seagate Portable) and not sure what to do. IDK if I remember the password but it's one of 5 passwords I use.
That being said, I personally would not go into Bitcoin until it dropped drastically, down to below $50 a coin. It probably will not happen, but if it does, I'll be in.
