Can't but eye roll with these types of comments. It would have taken serious effort to lose money to inflation over the past 100 years. Besides that, moderate inflation encourages lending, investment and consumption which is obviously important for the economy.

Only the Sith deal in absolutes. I can feasible hurt someone with a hammer and hammer with a gun, yet that does not mean that we should treat guns like hammers or vice versa. There is a scale and its a matter of choosing a point on that scale, not whether you either require registration (or whatever) for everything or nothing that “could be put to bad uses”.
Then there is the cost-benefit aspect, if information is the same on the scale of “could be put to bad uses” with money then it still might be treated the same due to the different amount of sacrifices you need to make to "control" it.

Ironically you took it literally. Like an absolute. You are reinforcing my point. The quote itself is a paradox. There was no great meaning for me using it and for you to interpret. 
Invoking "middle ground fallacy" is lazy and false. We are not debating whether rape is wrong or not. This is way more complicated and beyond that, we need pragmatic solutions, not philosophical  exercises.

Inflation does not mean the increase of supply although it connected to it. It's simply the price or value of currency. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:50:57
It's weird how fearful and paranoid people are about central banks. It's not very complicated but still it misunderstood. I suppose because "They can print money at will!" which is technically true, causes it. But then that is taken as money is being printed and then given to someone. Which is not true. 
While they could in priciple for example fund projects, wars or to pay foreign debt, its not done because the cure is worse than the disease. And of course, because its not needed. US bonds for example are easily sold anyway. They don't need the Fed to finance them. 
This printing of money works by expanding banks' ability to loan by buying already sold bonds in exchange for reserves. It's the banks that expand money supply by lending. The Feds don't actually print any money. The money doesn't actually go to anyone, other than maybe the lender/loaners if you want to look it that way. If central banks did not exist this money would have been created anyway. There in lies a small flaw. Central banks can restrict money supply very effectively through banks but its ability to expand is somewhat limited. Its called a liquidity trap which the Feds is in now by all accounts. 
Central banks create security. They reduce volatility. Fiat money has lower volatility than bitcoin will ever have. It does not matter how many users it adds or how much liquidity is added. Bitcoin can't have institutions like central banks that have the ability to bet against the market. People know that central banks can influence the currency and therefore there is never the need to panic or speculate. With bitcoin, people try speculate because noone is incontrol which just becomes a cycle of self fulfilling prophecies. This alone is enough reason for economies never to transfer the majority of its activity to bitcoin. Bitcoin could succeed in the fringes and niches but stability is worth more than anything bitcoin can offer.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:46:52
So, bitcoin does behave like fiat. It's ridiculous to claim banks to do fraud by loaning out the deposits. It could not be more clear. Where do people think the banks get the money from? And banks do just fine. Here you have bank in a country under incredible crisis having to restrict capital movements. 
The existence of banks provide liquidity. If it weren't for banks all that money would sitting in wallets doing nothing instead of providing funds for all sorts of projects. Have a business idea? Need a new machine in your shop? Mortgage? Too bad. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:03:33
Yes cause the supply of bitcoin will go down when governments ban it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:44:04
I doubt that applies to NSA, CIA, FBI or any ***. And even it did, then it would be public. Doesn't really matter. Bitcoin would be declared illegal. For example because the constitution says "no competing currencies" and then justifying the use of budget would be easy. Although just declaring it illegal would probably be enough.
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:58:22


  This makes absolutely no sense. There is nothing about bitcoin in particular that would cause this. MOst likely the original statement of them losing their share since the way they received it does not exist anymore is probably true. However, if 1% person in the dollar economy would lose his income, the result would be exactly the same. In fact, it would be accelerated. They would either lose some purchasing power or have to invest instead of sitting on the fortune.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:03:18


Of course it is. It however couldn't nearly replace banks. Especially for the small guy. Not only would it be more work, but the investable capital would be far lower since it would only include that capital which would not need to be liquid. In other words, your bank deposits (for most part). Read Dybvig&amp;Diamond for example.

You're not getting it. Does something have value without you being able to trade it? Nevermind where you got it from. Forget any actual market value. That is the only question that needs to be answered. It's a conceptual question. If you can't trade bitcoins, they are worthless. Therefore it has no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value in real world terms is meaningless, but still it does not change the fact that bitcoin has none.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:33:48
That's not intrinsic value because it would have to have value even if nobody else sees value in it. You can't send money around the globe as bitcoin because it wouldn't be accepted as money. Send you bitcoin to China and then what? Nobody would exchange into anything else. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:04:05

I love these "You are a &lt;insert label x here&gt;" and think it some how is a constructive response. Why don't you instead disprove me? Because you can't. You're motivated by politics. You like bitcoin for political reasons. It has a deflatory feature; I claim deflation is not good and you get angry because it offends your political sensibilities. You label me a central planner, while I've only discussed bitcoin factually. What deflation or inflation has to do with central planning, who the fuck knows...

  Banks can't change rates and terms at will. Some have adjusting rates, but those adjust at predetermined times and according to predetermined indices. Banks lose money on defaults. People wouldn't default otherwise. They would sell the house and repay the loan. Thats just logic.  Owners can resell or the amount they would get is less than the loan. The same applies to banks.

Not  this again. Why is it such hard concept to understand? Even the article gives the definition and then reasons that are supposed to give bitcoin intrinsic value but actually have nothing to do with intrinsic value. For something to have intrinsic value it has to have value without others giving it value. Obviously bitcoin only has value both economically and culturally if you can trade it. If bitoin had intrinsic value it would profitable to actually just make your own bitcoin version and mine bitcoins for you to eat or build a house out of...
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:27:44
An okay article. Didn't really convince me about anything though. 
I think he interprets  “Fiat money, if you like, is backed by men with guns” wrong. Initially he takes it literally, that people would be forced to use some currency by threat of violence. This obviously does not work. But later on, describes the real meaning: creating a monopoly. The monopoly can be mismanaged and lead to the collapse of the currency. 
In general the currency collapses are caused by: complete incompetence, assholes (dictators) or because it solved a problem that was even worse (with hindsight not necessarily true). Hyperinflation is easy to fix and extremely bad so Im confident that it won't happen in a democratic country. If it did, it would be the last of your worries because something much worse would be going on.
Mean while, bitcoins value is based guaranteed by unforgeability. That I can't agree with. Anyone can make million unforgeable currencies worth nothing. Unforgeability in itself guarantees nothing. Clearly though bitcoins have value. So what gives? People believe in it. Part of it is indeed the fact that it can't be forged. But that belief can be shattered. Maybe through weakness of SHA256 or something else. He even said it himself, there might come a better option.
Lastly, price stability. I think that fiat currencies win this easily. Central banks have the ability to control the amount of money supply and therefore its value. They might leave it floating on its own but ultimately, if need be, they can intervene. Bitcoin doesn't have that and not only that: people KNOW bitcoin doesn't have that. The existence of central banks eliminate a lot of the speculation. People acquire and sell based on needs. 
The counter argument to current price instability is volume. That however has diminishing returns. Volume can't eliminate volatility past a certain point and that point is far above fiat currencies. It's phenomenon is easy to explain to finance people. Volume is like diversifying between stocks of the same market. Volume increase means more users or agents. Essentially your diversifying between companies - you are eliminating firm specific risk. However, your not eliminating systemic risks. Risks that influence the whole market. 
An example: say you have 10 users of bitcoin and one needs to liquify his position. That would presumably influence the value greatly. Now what if there were millions? Essentially nothing at all assuming he isnt a very big holder. But what about an event that affects everyone? Say new legislation. The amount of users doesn't really matter, the prices would fluctuate wildly. Volume doesn't therefore help past a certain point.

The free market you are talking about is mostly just an illusion. Very few market genuinely work with out some regulation and/or inteference.

1) Whats your point? Because you seem to disagree with the article. The article says: goverments can't force the use of currency through threat of violence.
2) "Everything will fail eventually." Now there's a revelation. Dollar will fail. Bitcoin will fail. I'd put my money on bitcoin failing first. Would have to decide what constitutes failure though. 50% daily swifts? What problem could you fix with hyperinflation? Massive foreign debt for example. Hyperinflation is easy to fix, central bank just removes money supply. Does not mean the effects of hyperinflation until that point are easily fixed.
3)What I was trying to say is that unforgeability in itself doesnt give something value which was the argument in the article.
4)Anecdote time. How many times have you though about dollar or other fiat exchange rates? Do you check them monthly? Less? Apart from FX traders, the value changes so little and slowly that nobody gives a shit. Bitcoin mean while... Reason being, central banks cover your ass so you don't need to worry. Nobody panics.
5) Volume has diminishing returns, yes. Central banks eliminate systemic risks, which bitcoin can't do. I don't know how to explain to you anymore simply. You can go check massive stocks like Microsoft/Shell/Google and see, still good amount of volatility even with well over a billion in volume. Even gold, which I dont think is quite as good of a comparison. 
6) Nope, I'm writing in my third language. Do you understand firm specific and systematic risk? Because otherwise, you might as well not ready any of this. Ok, so imagine you buy million different stocks from NASDAQ or whatever. And now US goes bankrupt and unemployment jumps to 90%. Did it help that you diversified? Not really, no. Volume is like diversifying. Instead of diversifying stocks, you're diversifying users. If something impacts all users, it doesn't matter how many users you have. Your still in trouble. These little things happen that influence all the users every day/week. Whether its a large scam, legislation etc., so volume has diminishing return since it cannot eliminate this systemic risk. Did that help?

Deflation, it's one of those deceiving things. One the face it seems like it's great. The value of my income keeps getting more valuable. But there's no free lunch. 
  First, there would have to be pay cuts. Say, deflation is 10% then your wage cut would be 10% - increase in efficiency (value of your work) and possibly changes due to your negotiation power. So on average your wage cut would be 8%. Now lets hope you don't have any debt because the principal and payments are now 10% higher. 
  Then comes the problem with the economy. Increased debt service payments cause bankruptcies. On top of that, debt is a lot more expensive so the amount of investments and consumption decreases. And so on.  Elementary economics. 
"Yeah, nobody would ever want to earn something that will increase in value... that would be crazy." Sounds great, but it doesn't work that way.

Salt is quite specific compared to scrambeling the password. If you say the password is "X" and I salted it, then all I would do is use X and add random stuff at the end of it. I would never try modifying X itself. So it causes confusion.
Im not completely sure what you're asking. If you had my password and my salt then yes you would have my password :). 
The server needs to know the salt so it can use it and the password you gave to compare the resulting hash to the one they stored to see if you gave the right password. So even if the salts were encrypted, if the server were compromised then the salts would not be safe. And like you say, even if you had the salts you still need the password.

Unfortunately you and likeminded would be a very small niche. Imagine if you were the only one with a phone. The phone itself would be great but uselesa without a network of users. Gold also has other uses. It has liquidity because its legal and so forth...
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:36:17
Well, I agree the mismanagement of the monopoly would erode the trust which would cause the collapse of the currency. The trust is indeed key. I think the trust stems mostly from the ability of central banks to control money supply. No one can do that for bitcoin so I think that will be the key issue. While it's cool to hate central banks, they mostly do the stabilization part well.
Yes, networking effect is the reason and competitive advantage that bitcoin has. My point was mostly that the unforgeability (is that even a word) in itself does not give something value. Networking effect is however hard to predict. So bitcoin could last forever or not if something else comes along that is sufficiently better (which of course would make bitcoin collapse).
The analogy I was trying to make is that volume is like diversifying between different users. It eliminates the user specific "risk", since any ones impact on the market is diminished. So it decreases volatility but at some point you still have systemic risks that influence everyone (for example, legislation). The volume or the amount of users does not help. I made an example in another post of buying a million different stocks of NASDAQ after which US goes bankrupt and there's 90% unemployment. Did the diversification help? Not really. So bitcoin has higher volume but if something comes along that changes thing for everyone then the volume does not help with the volatility. And there are plenty of these event almost daily, small cases usually. I don't know if that makes it any clearer. I'm terrible at explaining things. Thanks for the good reply.

QE does not add financial assets. Feds bought bonds that were already purchased. It did not fund the treasury. QE was necessary since banks stopped lending. Not enough liquidity. So the central bank exchanged illiquid (bonds) assets into liquid assets (deposits) to create liquidity. It has no inflationary effects.
The US government's budget is covered by taxes abd debt. Debt bought by the private sector. It does not need the Feds. The bonds are easily sold since they are though off as very low risk in a bad economy.

Uhm, so the process goes: When you register, you give pw, the server then generates the salt and adds it to the end. PwSalt gets encrypted and a hash is generated. The hash AND the salt are stored. You come back and try to login, you give your pw. The server then goes and takes the stored salt and adds it, generates the hash and compares it to the one that was stored. If it's the same, your password was correct and it lets you enter.

Ironic that you say "why don't people get that?" when you're wrong. FBR does not require printing more dollars or bitcoins or whatever. Banks don't print dollars... It's the same money all the time. You deposit 10 btc, banks lends 9 btc out to someone, he buys something from you with it and you deposit your 9 btc. You now you have 19 btc in deposits when all the currency ever created was only 10. Problem is, if you try to withdraw the bank can only pay you the 10 and then give you the 9 btc loan.

One great problem with economics is that you literally can't test anything. You can make very small scale experiments to try isolate but when it works, its only useful in microeconomics. Its like physics where everything influences everything, shit behaves incosistently and instead observing, predictions change the future.
Heres a thing that I think you fail to understand: accurate predictions are paradoxes. Literally impossible. If we had credible predictions, they would alter our behaviour as we adjust to the prediction making the initial prediction wrong. If I predicted your death at a street corner by a stray bullet tomorrow, you would probably avoid standing there and there by making the prediction inaccurate. Then there the similar but opposite effect of self fulfillign prophecies. If Buffet predicts that the value of bitcoin will sky rocket, it surely will.
If you can relinquish your desire for completely accurate predictions (especially longterm) and understand that economics is much more about understanding relationships than it is about predicting the future, then you might see the value of economics. As an example, it's wasn't too long ago that we did not understand that trade could be beneficial for both parties. That by trading we could have have an outcome greater than the aggregate of our individual efforts. Or what causes unemployment. Or how banks could be more efficient at allocating capital than exchange markets. The advances of our understanding of game theory and so forth.
I think the reason people are so negative about economics is because its hard if not impossible to separate from politics. Economist often have opinions and preferences which they express. And since preferences or utilities cannot be expressed in an explicit form, we will never truly settle the debate between for example social security vs. economic growth. Its all all just our own preference between all the trade offs. People associate their distaste for economist's preffered politics with his science.

Sort of true. Stocks and such do have value despite what others do. Bitcoin is a ponzi in the sene that you have an insentive to get others in board and profits you get are funded by those that come later. Its not a ponzi in that its purpose is not to be a ponzi and there ia no central purpotrator.

Apart from the Keynesian, I agree. And that's in contrast with what Andreas was saying. 
We already have forex market. Open 24 hours a day (althoug I believe only 5 days a week?) and is also not bound to a physical location or a central organizer. Not really a new idea. Margins are much larger on bitcoins. Forex exchanges are cheaper, little chance for arbitrage as well. NYSE is not under any threat. If you think you could create better stock market then you could do it already. Bitcoins doesn't have anything to do with.
 Stock markets don't need to be open 24/7. In fact, it's purposefully not open all the time. You can change your broker cheaply and easily and the prices they charge are equal or less than bitcoin exchanges. There might be opportunity for marginal improvement, but it would really be marginal. Bitcoin does not solve insider trading, accounting, ponzis, fairness, disputes and so on. The actual transaction is only a very small part of it all.

By all means, provide a source. I bet you just took the increased m0 and figured that would be it. Hint: m0 is not the same as m1, which really matters. The money multiplier in the US is about 0.7 right now. The central bank is trying to create liquidity but since banks don't take advantage of the liquidity that the central banks provide, they are some what ineffective. The central bank "printing" is just dumbed down term which creates confusion. They control the ability of banks to lend which in turn effect money supply. They don't explicitly "print".
The worth of bitcoins could not cover your military expenses, true. But thats not an argument. I'm talking about the situation if bitcoins would "replace" dollars. Otherwise, might as well use any small currency then. The military is funded by taxes.

In my opinion people in Ukraine weren't using fiat. They were using bankcoins etc. 
Banks provide a very valuable service. Bitcoins can't replace that role without behaving like fiat. The money here isn't lost, its illiquid. It takes time to liquidate and if the bank run continues, its possible that in the end costly to the point that parts of deposits might be lost. Should be covered in most cases by the insurance.

Economists are people and therefore they have political opinions. Some times it can show in their opinions on how to organize the economy. As to why you would want to point that out I don't know because economists are pretty damn neutral if you use bitcoin users as reference. 
Criticism about economists not "understanding" bitcoin and therefore having the "false" opinions about it is not true. Bitcoin extremely simple to analyze and offers nothing new to consider in terms economic theory. Bitcoin is far simpler than Fiat money. Economists don't care how you accomplish for example, unforgeability, infinite divisibility or sending/receiving bitcoins. Makes no difference. Once you strip away those, you're left with essentially money with no central banks or borders. Easy. Cool, but not that impressive. Gold that can be instantly transferred.
So once you strip away the technological features and detach emotionally from the concept of decentralized money you're left with something that's interesting and potentially helpful but hardly revolutionary. I don't think the problem is that economists don't understand the new, its that bitcoiners dont understand the old (and therefore have no reference).

Generally created by regulation. Small areas of the economy could benefit from deregulation, but they are exceptions.


Good regulation is seldomly achieved if you expect perfection. I would judge it by the average welfare created. Some win, some lose but on average people are better off. There are plenty of good monopolies and even monopolies which end up being better than perfect competition, mostly with things dealing with the environment, natural resources and generally industries with externalities.
This is more philosophical and based on preferences than anything quantifiable.

At least it starts of with bullshit, I watched the 4 or so minutes. Some how sitting on dollars and not investing is profitable in traditional currencies which have inflation while, bitcoin has it the other way around with deflation. Then somehow only making weapons, bombs and cheating is profitable and that some how that is attached to the currency of choice. Makes no sense.
Bitcoin drives innovation. How? What feature about bitcoin accomplishes this? Nothing. Bitcoin is not that different. It's fast, relatively easy and ignores borders. Then as a trade off it's volatile and deflatory. At best its an improvement. People attach feelings and political ideology to bitcoin and then see what they want to see. 
He talks about 1000s of jobs created (source?) in essentially the same sentence when he said that it's not a zero sum game. Where did these people come from? They worked in the dollar/euro economy and they consumed using those currencies. Now they don't. Dollar's loss, bitcoin's gain. You could argue that they now become more efficient/innovative so that they're value is greater in the bitcoin economy than in the dollar one. Apart from products and services directly attached to bitcoin (exchanges and what not), how would that have been accomplished? I struggle to imagine innovations hinged on bitcoin with out actually being about bitcoin. SR etc.? Minuscule at best. 
Bitcoin is not necessarily a zero sum game but it's close enough. The one thing that bitcoin has going for it is that people want it to succeed. So they might buy and work cheaper etc. just to make bitcoin look better. Oh look, a big corporation now accepts bitcoin, better go buy the laptop I don't really need. 
This is just pushing a political agenda. Fluff words that don't actually mean much but resonate with certain demographics. Certainly nothing to do with actual merits of currencies.

  I don't know how that applies to this. Anyway, the lender has aexchange risk. That's a fact. I loan you 1000 bitcoins. Bitcoin drops from 1000 to 1 dollar the assets that was the loan is now 1/1000th of it previous value. Converting payments does not help because those are not part of the debt anymore. If I had 1000 bitcoins. You pay 1 and I exchange it to dollars, I still have 999 at risk.

Yes, that's correct. It would have to be able to adjust both ways and against the market.
Only "solution" I've come up with is that mining difficulty would be adjusted according to demand/price. Higher price would mean easier mining and vice versa. Obviously the difficulty would have to be adjusted often. And for it to work, bitcoins would also have to be destroyed during low demand, obviously it would effect everyone equally. Say 0.5% of your bitcoins destroyed during drop in prices.
Would it work? Don't know, probably not. One problem I could see is that since bitcoins aren't widely used and people don't have income in bitcoin and goods aren't priced in btc etc. the drop in supply might not raise the demand as one would expect. Only saving grace would be that it doesn't necessarily need to work perfectly because people believing it works already eliminates volatility (it's a game theory thing).

To make clear: Im talking about selling, holding and buying btc for profit.
Why are bankers evil for trying to profit from ignorance and fear? All that is changing compared to bitcoin is the scope and relative complexity. 
The odds thing depends on how widely you want to look at it. If you expect btc to go global then you certainly have a leg up. You are educated and wealthy. 
By beneficiary I meant that you'll make money from the growth of bitcoin. Making a profit from holding bitcoin, selling or buying it creates nothing new and is a zero sum game.

You loan bitcoins. The loan is an asset. That asset is denominated in bitcoins. Bitcoins lose value. Your asset (the loan) loses value.

Examples: Police, defense, firefighters, welfare, parks and the environment, safety &amp; regulations, roads and infrastructure, justice system &amp; prisons etc., I could go on. 
Let's look at the police. Without the government who have the rights to police? Who pays them? Can you opt out? If you can't, then how is it different from taxes? If you can then will the police only respond to calls from payers? If they respond to all calls, then what incentive do you have to pay? And so on. 
Even with the IRS (whose budget is about $11 billion) the grey economy (not accounted for or payed taxes on) is about 1 trillion. So no, "dealing with freeloaders" what ever that means, would not save any money. It would cost trillions. 
Saying that government are not more efficient at providing some services is like saying sun circles the earth. It is that obvious. Nobody that has any idea, disputes it.

Obviously, but the value of the bitcoins would be higher meaning exchanging dollar to BTC would become more expensive.

And what about economists in other countries. No one, anywhere, has the resources to study something for a couple of years to potentially win a Nobel prize because they might not get government grants? It's the ones confirming inflation being better that have trouble. Its not interesting. 
Governments want economic growth and that obviously includes debt, an healthy amount of it. But debt has nothing to do with having to work or not. You have to eat, pay the bills. I don't have debt. Why do I still have to work? 
Savings are good, I agree with that. But everything in the right proportion. Savings appreciating sounds great but that's not whole story. Investments become less profitable, your wages decreases as sales decrease in dollar terms, if you have debt, it keeps getting bigger and so forth. And what if you don't have savings? Is this again just great for the wealthy?
Absolutely, without a doubt, consumption can be incentivized or disincentivized. People wants are infinite but they try to satisfy them with scarce resources. You maximize what you get with what you have. You maximize your marginal utility. If waiting for tomorrow is the choice that maximizes marginal utility you do that which then is aggregated to the whole economy and it suffers.

Yes, you call it inflation. You can have less stuff available for the same amount of currency or the same amount of stuff for more currency. Both lead to the same thing: inflation. In principle there is also the velocity of the money circulation but that tends to be pretty stable.
I mean there is no need to look further than Bitcoin for an example. Deflation and more and more Bitcoin in circulation at the same time. How does that work?

Someone living paycheck to paycheck does not have savings to lose to inflation. In fact inflation tends to assist with the debt the person is likely to have.

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:28:12
I should probably dial back on the absolute, since I don't think I or anyone else knows for sure either way. Some transactions would only occur if LN is implemented and a lot of transaction will be eliminated due to LN.
The reason I believe that LN would end up eliminating transactions is that transaction growth would become more logarithmic over number of users and total transaction volume. As the number of users grow and bitcoin would become more prevalent, the share of LN transactions of the total (LN+blockchain) would grow. That said, logarithmic growth can still be become bigger than a linear one if the inputs are sufficiently larger enough.
The reason why I think nobody knows for sure is the classics economics problem. There is no control to compare to. There are no two identical realities where the only difference would be whether LN was implemented or not and therefore we can't know for sure, what would have happened in the scenario that did not actually occur (if LN is implemented we don't know what the number of transaction would have been if it hadn't and vice versa).

@_date: 2017-01-25 15:36:36


I don 't know what you are trying to say? Because I can't or won't pay for something it has no value to me??
Altcoins are generally accepted as payment. Intrinsic value means that it has value without network effects. Again, if bitcoin has intrinsic value then you would make your own personal fork. Not altcoins or anything else, just your own coin. Number of users: 1. Since it (supposedly) has intrinsic value, you don't need anyone else for it to have some sort of value (use) for you.
This is explaining how Bitcoin can be banned in the sense that if it were to banned then even though this does not stop bitcoins from moving, there would be no real future for Bitcoin. Unlike drugs or piracy, banning the use would directly affect its value and usefulness. While the government has banned the use of drugs, that has no effect on the high I get. If the government bans Bitcoin, it means that I can't use Bitcoin to pay for games of Steam or whatever and thus it directly influences its usefulness/value. It does not mean that use would be instantly zero or anything of the like...
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:45:43
Because they cant afford it or they dont want to pay? What difference does it make? 
Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value, which is fine and does not really matter in most situations. The utility comes from someone accepting it as payment and rarity enables value but does not cause it (maybe more accurate would be to say that it actually enables price). If bitcoin had intrinsic value then you would fork your own version as it would have value even if nobody accepts it as payment. And this fork would only have one coin in total since rarity increases value.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:55:28

Without 'coercive' power there it would not be possible to reach socially optimal/better outcomes. Voluntary taxes (if that is what you propose) would simply result in freeloading and suffering for those that can't help themselves. Think of the prisoner dilemma. The government is like an outside force that forces the the two prisoners to coordinate and results in them both being better off. Of course I'm generalizing and not every single individual is better off, but collectively we are yada yada... But you get to vote on what the taxes should be and ultimately you can leave if you feel like it's not worth it. 
If Bitcoin is voluntary because you can choose to not participate, then I don't see how taxes are not voluntary. The stakes are just much higher. The trouble/inertia to leave the country vs. leaving Bitcoin is much higher but the principle is the same. 
If the choice was made to double transaction fees then you could either accept it or not use Bitcoin, but you could not unilaterally ignore it and continue as before anymore than you could ignore changes in taxes.

Yes, they are competing and have an impact. If I make 5000 transactions with 100 satoshi/byte and others then compensate and create 5000 transactions with 110 satoshia/byte and none of my transactions confirm then I still affected the transaction fee. Lets put this way, if the 17000 unconfirmed teansaction were not there, would the transactions fee not be affected?
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:52:46
I understand that. But you seem to imply that Bitcoin is some how doing something especially well, when in truth, the big difference is just the scale (of the problem). On one hand there is the general government and representative democracy and on the other open source software development.

I don't think the volatility of Bitcoin will continue reduce at the current rate and catch fiat because there is no central bank.

Yes? How is this related to a currency that has been weakening for less than a year? There's no connection.


How? With a weakinging Euro, oil becomes more expensive. Oil is used in a whole lot of industries and so a lot of things become a bit more expensive. Who cares if your competitiveness is up 35%. Inflation is like 0.5% is probably just a good thing.

Maybe I misunderstood but isnt the major reason for high transactions costs in mutual funds not actual transaction costs but rather to cover the illiquidity risk? That beteeen the time you purchase the fund and  the fund actually acquiring the underlying assets on your behalf, there is a risk of markets moving? Which is why the higher the volatility and the more illuquid the asset, the higher the cost? So if they eliminate this costs then they are just carrying more risk?

Well there pretty good reason people don't makes houses out gold. Would be pretty expensive. And make for pretty bad houses too. But ignoring that. I could imagine any metal being extremely useful. Knives or a head of a spear. Maybe make it into a reflector and make fire with it. A bowl. 
Anyway, loads of things can have extremely low value or essentially none in this scenario and still have intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is an idea, concept or a rhetorical tool. It does not need to stand up to extreme scrutiny. Just like we don't start arguing whether something is black if it reflects more than 0% of light. If I say something black, you know what I mean. If I say something has intrinsic value you (should) know what I mean.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:48:33
I waved it away because this type of conversations are meaningless. What is life really? Does it anything have value? Is the universe simply a marble hanging from a cat's collar? Everything is relative/subjective. Im boring myself already. It's not interesting or practical. 
I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say or how it relates to bitcoin or intrinsic value. Even if value is largely subjective I think we can agree that some things have universal enough value that they could be considered to have value objectively. If there is someone that assign zero value to water then he is not rational and then everything goes out the window. 
You don't need everyone to agree on a value anyway. Do things have values? Yes. Can things have value in isolation or that comes within? Yes. Can things have value that does not come from themselves? Yes. For example Bitcoins where the value comes from the transaction they make possible. Without the transaction, the bitcoins have no value. Then there you have it. Intrinsic value. Not that hard. One word followed by another. If you still disagree, then I suggest trying to be more practical and not abstract to the absurd.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:23:20
You mean the second point? Because otherwise there is no point. I need to save up a ton of feminism to pay back my tuition.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:02:33
Boy, you'd hate economics. We actually have functions for utility/value. Im telling you. We assign values for you. Its crazy. Obviously doesn't work very well on an individuals but its ok at an aggregate level, on average. Im sure aggregate subjectivity really ruffles your feathers. If you'd only settle on perfection you wouldn't get very far. That's how the real world works. 
Still don't understand why assigning value or subjectivity is a problem. I and others assign value to water so we can consume it. We assign value to bitcoins so we can do transactions with them. Transactions requires 2 or more parties. Bitcoins themselves have no value. That's subjectively objectively maybe false. Im only interested what we typically assign that value to in what we are looking at, not what the value is. Other than that, don't know what to tell you.
If you want, you can ignore "intrinsic value". Remove it from your vocabulary or something. Ill continue to use it. It sometimes useful. Not very often. 
You cant find any use for water outside of transactions? Ok.
I assign no value to this conversation. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:45:37
You can't trade a blockchain or a system of record keeping, which is how your approaching it instead of a single bitcoin. I think intrinsic value requires that it's tradeable (in practice) and you can use it alone. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:24:24
If you truly want, you can get really philosophical then sure nothing has value, but then again nothing has anything and everything at the same time and blablabla. 
Let's be practical though. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that water has value to everyone. And the value of bitcoins comes from the transactions, not themselves. So bitcoin has no intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:58:10
I'm sorry but bitcoin does not have intrinsic value. If it did, the whole concept would be pointless. Don't worry though, that has reflection no bitcoins value as a currency or a network etc. 
First of all, how am I going to trade a decentralized identity network in the first place? I think it goes without saying that you need to be able to trade it at least in theory. Otherwise, the whole "does it have value if i can't trade it?" seems pretty pointless.
Here is another way of putting it. If bitcoins had intrinsic value, it would make sense to make your own and just mine them. My very own bRuTaLCoin. Of course no one would trade me anything for them, but that doesn't matter because they still have intrinsic value, so it makes sense. Yet, no one does that. Because bitcoins don't have intrinsic value... 
In many ways your right, it is largely a check on "is it physical?". I think some services which you can use alone, pass the test as well. For example a barbershop or a doctor. In terms of bitcoins, intrinsic value has absolutely no bearing on its potential as anything. For whatever reason, people here just harp on it as if did. As if bitcoin needs to have it. Bitcoin can be the greatest thing to happen to mankind and have no intrinsic value. Those are not mutually exclusive.
To me insistence that bitcoin has intrinsic value just seems like insecurity. It has the word "value" in it so bitcoin has to have it. I feel the need to correct them because it's simply wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:57:20
Yep. It's fine for a currency to not have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:32:01
I'm not entirely sure what your point is. Value is like utility. You can't express the amount of value something as a number but you can put things in order. Value therefore has an ordinal scale. Y more valuable than X.  And no, you can say this cars value is 5000 dollars because really your just saying you value the car more than 5000 dollars. Price is it own thing. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:53:52
I'm confident because I'm right. If someone disagrees even after I try to explain then it's simply because I failed to explain it. 
Something has intrinsic value if theres some value that comes from within itself. Bitcoin's and the blockchain's value comes from the transactions, not themselves. Bitcoins are simply a medium for these transactions. 
For the 8th time today, let me put it another way. You are alone on a deserted island. Youll never see anyone else and obviously can't communicate with anyone. Youll have a laptop with the blockchain and a wallet with loads of bitcoins. Explain how they will be useful to you on the island. They won't because they don't have any  intrinsic value. Because the value was in the transaction. Which you can't perform because your the only party.
If my arguments are weak then point out weaknesses. We can debate them.
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:05:39


It's a concept. The example of no one willing to trade is a helpful though experiment to understand what it means. There's no requirement for the scenario to ever happen for it to be "true".

How? Remember that it's only been a year so you can't use anything  that started before then as proof.
I think you just don't understand economics very well. Just because Japan isn't doing well and it's currency has weakened (can't bother to fact check this, doesn't matter in terms of my point) doesn't mean that moderate weaking of currency isn't beneficial. Japan's economy is weak despite of it. For example, people that go to the hospital are likelier to die. Does that mean that going to the hospital kills people? 
And yes, extreme weakening is bad. This is not extreme.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:52:03
Why is intrinsic value such a hard concept for some to understand? There is such a thing as intrinsic value. Its simply that something has value even if no one accepts it in a trade. Water has value, because even if no one wants trade anything for it, I can still drink it or wash myself etc. Gold has intrinsic value because of it's chemical properties. I could make paper weights out of it. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value because there's literally nothing I can do with them if no one accepts them.

That has a lot more to do with productivity and growth rate, which at the moment are poor. I was merely comparing two hypotherical scenarios with money supply growth vs none with everything else staying the same. Also if we would use btc you would have to take pay cuts ( due to deflation)... 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:48:05


The crisis did have nothing to do with the currency. At worst, if it did, it would be because of conflicting interests in terms of currency. For example one country needing a weak and other a strong currency. Not a failure on the central bank. 
I think crashes have already happened. In fact, bitcoin has gone through bigger crises than the dollar ever has. The central bank can stop hyperinflation any time it wants as well as deflation.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:22:08




They are going the same way as everybody else. They are not creating stability. For stability you need to do the exact opposite of what everyone else is doing. When everyone sell, you buy and vice verse. You lose money doing. And imagine if for whatever reason the market decides to buy massively, you try to sell to stabilize but will run out of bitcoin and after that you cant effect the prices anymore. You need an endless supply to make sure you can always stabilize the market and to fund the bad deals youre making.


The argument was that people would want to trade stability for deflation. And I said, no they don't. Stability is extremely crucial and deflation isn't even a benefit. Its like saying, "People want to trade their yearly income to get cancer." (Extreme but Im trying to make a point.)


It's really hard to discuss these things with you when you dont have even rudementary economics knowledge. I dont understand what you mean by "0 years of data points for those other claims". What claims? Anyway, in those five or so years, bitcoin has gone through bigger crises than dollar has in its whole history. Just this month, there has been 420% deflation (/trees conspiracy)! 
And the whole "fiat, gold, whatever can be confiscated and banks can fall!" argument really does not see the forest from the trees. How many times has your deposit been lost or gold seized? What about your friends family? Anyone? Occasionally you read about seizures which dont seem right but the risk is comparable to winnig the lottery, where as losing a lot of money bitcoin is the faith of half of the people pretty much (any money that someone makes with bitcoin comes from someone else, its a zero sum game).
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:14:01
I understand that, but my point was that the price drops in the case you brought up was due to a bursting of a speculative bubble but if US banned bitcoin use then the demand drop would be real and the price drop "permanent". 
@_date: 2013-10-15 18:56:21
That was the banks failing. It is no secret that if the bank fails then there is possibility of losing your deposit. Deposit is a loan to the bank and if it goes belly up it cant pay it back. Its why we have deposit insurances for everyone up to a certain amount. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:23:53
There is in fiat currencies and that is why have fiat currencies. And that is what central banks do. If there is pressure for the price to rise, the central bank releases currency until that demand is met  (and keeping the price stable) and vice verse.
Often central banks let the currency float because that is better than trying to control it too much, but the mere presence of central banks gives people believe in the stability of the currency. 
For example, even healthy banks can go insolvent due to bank runs. Bank runs can happen to healthy banks because regardless how the bank does, it is in the depositors interest to withdraw if he thinks others will. That's why we have depositors insurance, to break this inefficient incentive (doesn't always work). Central banks work in much the same way, they give confidence simply by existing because people know that any large fluctuations can be stopped by the central bank so they don't bother panic buying/selling which means that these shocks never happen in the first place!
@_date: 2013-10-14 10:12:54
Bitcoin is dependent on the networking effect. If US banned bitcoin, it would kill Bitcoin at this point pretty much.

I understand banks perfectly fine. Its you who is constantly having adjust your numbers to make even slightest amount of sense. All your doing is (Deposits/Reserve rate)* Net interest. This is an extreme simplification which does not work empirically. If nothing else, check any banks balance sheet and income statement and see for yourself.
You assume a money multiplier of 10 (=1/0,1) with these calculations. You completely ignore any elasticity. What is the real money multiplier? Currently it is 0,7 in the US. 
This is actually quite bad, since the central bank cant force the banks to lend anymore. Its called a liquidity trap. This is in conflict with everything youve been saying. You simply assume that banks lends out every available dollar according to`some theoretical maximum money multiplier, consumers want to loan every available dollar without the interest adjusting and you ignore the effects of defaults. Your math is wrong and useless.

Why dont you actually show some proof and examples. You just claim there is overwhelming proof but provide none. 
"It is idiotic because all examples of free banking in the history of humanity have been price deflationary and stable economically."
What do you mean by "free banking"? No central banks? Certainly anything I could imagine being free banking was not stable. 
Economics before 20th century was a joke anyway. No systems or bookkeeping to do even rudementary analysis of data. Why are you bring them up, as if they had some superior perspective.
You seem to make also ridicolous causality links between inflation and bubbles. Bubbles happening during inflation prove nothing in terms of them actually causing bubbles. 
Anyway, I think your labeling of pro-inflationist and pro-deflationist is wrong. I doubt anyone is one, and at least should not be either. Central banks and people that advocate them, are for price stability. Keeping inflation and deflation in check. The objective is not to cause inflation but to avoid large price fluctuations. Siding on the slight inflation side since its seen as better option than slight deflation.

I dont think bitcoin is ever going to be worth $1,000,000. And I certainly hope it never will be. It would be incredibly wrong. Insane amount of wealth redistribution from the poor and middle class to the rich, again. The top 500 wallets now hold 35% of all bitcoins and who knows how few individuals are behind those wallets. The disparity between the poor and rich would become even greater. 
Most of us would become millionaires, multimillionaires or even billionaires. And for what? For our awesome contribution to society of buying a couple bitcoins. All of the money we would get would be from someone else's back.

The printing is meaningless if it isnt reflected in valuations. If the demand increases at the same pace then all the printing does is keep at the same price level, which is good.

Possible prison time for crimes, is now the same thing as I as pulling a gun out? I know for fact, that the only reason your arguing at all is because its DPR. Al Capone? Nope. Random drug dealer, hang the guy! 
But the fact is, if your arguments apply to DPR, then applies to everyone. Prosecutors are free game as probably are witnesses. After all, they threaten you and others with "violence of the state". But the end justfies the means, right? I mean he was fighting for our freedom?! Nope, just your perception of it, which is meaningless. We live in a democracy, where rules are what the majority agrees upon. Your disagreement with them doesnt justify breaking them. Because, again, if it did, then they would be pointless.

Conclusively, nothing. But it does seem like it. Going around media hyping a financial asset you own is not ethical.

Your post is slightly confusing. Im not sure what your point is. However, in terms of excusing DPR for the hits: I feel Ive experienced this before. There is a hero, who is held in high regard. Info comes to light that puts him/her in bad light. Shock, then excuses and justification and then in the end acceptance, for most. 
The man ordered murders and torture. There is no justification.  In one case he feared that the guy had gone to the cops? Torture and kill... No peaceful way to resolve? Get out, the country, the business, whatever. Once you have to kill to keep it going then its not worth it. Providing drugs to people is not worth killing people over.

Im not against people making money from investments. However, I define investments as something that creates a net benefit. That creates something new. Machines build products, real states provides places to live, employees get jobs and create new goods and services. 
That bitcoin you have in your wallet waiting for the price to rise is speculation. Any money you make is coming from someone else, its a zero sum game. Investments arent zero sum. When you aggregate the incomes and payments together its positive, where as with bitcoin (or gold, oil etc. but at least they have some intrinsic value) if you aggregate the incomes and costs together will result in zero. Holding bitcoins is not an investment. Bitcoins success is not depended on bitcoin speculators.
You risk couple hundred/thousand bucks to buy currency along with 100,000 others and you think your visionary and risk-taking achievement is worthy of a return of 25-2 500 years of labor coming of the backs of the poor because they will be the last to adopt?

Yes and no. Some industries cant decrease their prices since they cant reduce costs. Energy was abundant and plentiful in the past but the easiest resources have now been used and energy is harder to produce. Electronics is now cheaper because they can still innovate and make the same things more cheaply. When all these industries are averaged out then my purchasing power has increased. Its not just about prices but also about income increases. If inflation is 5% and I get a payraise of 5% then my PP did not change. On average PP has increased over time.

For the biggest problem is the morality. I don't think it is right that early adopters would profit as they would if bitcoin would become wide spread. Even with quite limited use it could go as high as $5,000. That said, I dont think it will become all that common. International trade has pretty much nothing to gain from it, internet commerce maybe some. What with all the fiat hate? If all fiat money would cease to exist and go to bitcoin it would destroy the economy. Bitcoin might supplement fiat but not replace it. And I hope that in the future bitcoin would be replaced with something better, now that its shown that there is interest.

Obviously there is a certain cutoff point. Its not about absolutes. Sugar is technically bad for you, but its agreed that not bad enough to justify banning it. Hard drugs are also bad for you and bad enough to justify banning. Now the counter argument usually is that it each persons personal freedom to do bad things to their body. However, its not a victim less crime. Drugs alter your behavior and are very detrimental to your health. You might hurts someone or hurt yourself to the point that you cant take care of yourself, making others victims. So the core issue is, that in general, people agree that, the small person gain of freedom by allowing use is not worth the trade off.

In terms what the exact effect of banning in the US would be, no. Really complicated. Logically it would be quite destructive.

What is even your point? That bitcoin is easy to manipulate and untrustworthy? The link you gave seemed much more of game theory thought experiment with assumptions. It required the attempts to manipulate to be public. 
Any attempt to manipulate through mining would have to be to have more bitcoins than you should (double spend or whatever)? Wouldnt that be pretty easily detectable? Other than that, I still dont know how you profit from it? And if it isnt detectable, then how do you know it doesnt happen right now? 
So either manipulating is detectable, meaning you cant make back the expenses for mining equipment or it isnt and manipulating could be happening right now making bitcoin pretty much useless.

I appreciate that wrote a though out response.
When I said that inflation does not cause destruction of purchasing power I meant: for inflation to cause destruction of PP it would require interference. If there were no interference, then wages would adjust and the net effect be zero. Now in practice wages are rigid etc. so extreme and ESPECIALLY UNEXPECTED inflation would cause loss of PP even if there no special mechanisms that would skew the market powers in one parties favor. So I argue: it's not inflation that causes PP loss, but the mechanisms that dont allow wages to adjust.
When it comes to the Federal Reserve, Im no expert but I do know that your math is wrong or at best completely misleading. "Printed" money isnt given away, its loaned. So it doesnt boost anyones bottom line directly. 
Fractional Reserve Baking does indeed loan out the added money base, which then creates interest. However, how this is bad, I dont know. Anyone that took the loan knows that he is paying interest on it and chose to take it. Meaning that the loan was beneficial to him and he either bought a home or made an investment that produces a better return than the interest he is paying, either way, generally speaking, both are better off. You make it sound like its a one way street. 
The evils of cheap money:
No doubt that if there is too much money it will create problem. But banks are not happy to just increase the amount of debt indefinitely, just look at the financial crises. Enormous losses. Banks want the level of debt to be at a point where it is healthy. Otherwise, defaults will just eat all the profits.
Your math is just getting WAAAAY OFF at this point. 125% of economic output goes to banks? You don't have to be very smart to know that just doesn't work out. I dont know the exact ratio of money base compared to m2 or m3 but probably  its closer to 1:5 - 1:8 that the 1:20 you suggest. And if the money supply expands it just means that the banks are getting worse of because the loan they have out are now worth less. 
Do you know what banks do with the interests they get? They pay the depositors. Do you know who these depositors are? Consumers. Depositors fund the loans that banks give out, they charge interest on it and pay interest to depositors that is lower than what they charged and then pocket the difference. If the lender defaults, its out of the banks pocket so they also carry the risks. They obviously have to pay employees and other costs etc. Banking is not some wonder land of incredible profits. Investment banking however, is not working properly and should be addressed. 
If you look at the bailouts, they were funded by the Feds. However, what you fail to see is, that that money was not free. It essentially already clear that the Feds will get more than they gave out. 
I agree, there is systematic corruption with in the rating companies and the largest investment banks of the US and internationally. The core reason for the financial crisis.
All in all, the problem just isnt inflation. Deflation or even 0 anything changes nothing for the better. Imagine if you had loaned 10 bitcoins in june, in dollar term your debt would have gone from $800 to $10 000. Does that seem like its any better? Or if there was 0 inflation. Banks could still lend out money and charge interest which is evil for some reason.
Deflation creates the wrong incentives and therefore isnt really an option. A controlled small inflation creates beneficial incentives which is why its chosen.
I think you just fail to see the forest from the trees. Banks arent just some money making faceless machine, absolute vast majority of the benefits of banking go to society through them facilitating moving capital from those who have the excess of it to where it is most efficiently creating new wealth. And for this service and after paying its employees (aka the spawns of satan) they make a decent profit.
So the problem is not central banks or the feds. It isn't inflation (that is reasonable and predictable) or the banking sector at large. The problem is the skewed power between different interest groups. PACs and other ways of influence, corruption and moral hazard and lack of will to investigate white collar crime are the core reasons for problems. Changing how the currency works just does not solve these problems.
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:24:33
Well I don't :P. I find it peculiar how grand and optimistic some people are about Bitcoin when it just another form of payment that really isn't that different. Its more expensive to use than cash (you need electronics for example), its almost instantaneous but so are credit card and paypal (at least from the perspective of the buyer), lower costs of exchanging but not eliminating it. So I dont know where such great effects would come from. And we experience few percet effieciency increases almost yearly. I dont theres much difference between 2004 and now or something. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:31:24

But its even better if the rise and crash never happens in the first place. 
Also, the crashes can have complicated effects on other things. Like it did with the financial crisis. The housing market crashes, which causes the builder to lose his business which causes his employee to lose his job which causes him not to buy that ATV he thought about buying which causes the ATV company to cut back etc. etc.
But anyway, crashes are not good, especially for bitcoin. Volatility is the the worst thing for any currency.

@_date: 2013-10-03 07:00:46
What do you mean? That it shouldnt be illegal?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:47:20
Clearly they dont. When they try to lend out more it means that have to offer it at a lower interest. The risk of default however gets higher. And at some point banks dont want to lend out anymore, because the the interest they get is lower that the rate of default. I even showed, in black and white, how youre wrong. If naive means that I base my arguments on facts instead of "BANKS ARE EVIL!", then sure. 
All loans and deposits are on the banks balance sheet. Their income from interest rates are on their income statement. If things were as you say they are, it would be clear from those statements. 
Its clear that your ideas are politically charged. You have an idea that banks are evil, then you study economics for a couple of hours to JUSTIFY YOUR ORIGINAL VIEW, not to learn how it actually is. Banks can be evil but its not through the mechanisms you argue. You simply don't have enough knowledge of economics, which is fine but at least try to learn and adjust your views based on what you learn.

I also disagree with the DPR thing. No big news agency reported in on any major scale. Literally none in my country but alot about Snowden and Assange/Wikileaks. Ask a random person and Id argue the 95-98% of people have not heard of DPR. And explain what he did without the possible murders most of them would also not symphatise with him. Legalizing pot and all drugs are very different things. And while people might support the cause they are not passionate about it. "Meh, why not I guess".

Within the last decade the poorest have lost a small amount PP it would seem. Over the last century however, the PP has risen dramatically for every group. The problem however isnt inflation. So what is? 
Wages dont adjust. Which is not the fault of inflation. You would be losing PP even with deflation, you dont have enough of negotiation power. So if there was deflation, wages would have to drop and since you cant even beat inflation then you clearly dont have the negotiation power to beat deflation either and your wages would drop more than the rate deflation. 
The core problem is negotiation power, not inflation. As far as "What are the consequences when a nation stops saving and producing?", I have no clue what youre getting at. And let me guess: youll respond that "why would wages drop with deflation?"

You might think your right, but so does everybody else. If your morals can come into it, so can everybody else's. Its why we have democracy.

When it comes to central banks role as the puppet of the rich, I think its overstated (at least in The rich and the poor simply have the same interest. Above all of which is price stability.

I dont get how bitcoin will achieve any of those things. An upswing greater than the industrial revolution? By upswing Id imagine you mean wealth? Bitcoin cant do that. For bitcoin to be a liberator of the poor then it would have to be given to them since they certainly cant afford it. And at that point why not just give what ever currency they already use? Using bitcoin would be more expensive than using cash so it doesnt make much sense. You can do a lot good with the wealth you acquired through bitcoin but bitcoin itself cant do anything.

Id be interested to know how they calculated the loan guarantees. Huge sum, but I have heard much smaller numbers. On the other hand it is "only" a guarantee which wont realize in any significant amount. The whole TARP is an interesting from an ethics perspective. On one hand, not doing would mean surreal amount of financial damage and everyone would suffer greatly. On the other hand, it leads to moral hazard with big companies. In TARPa defense, the $800 billion was not just given away. It was used to buy illiquid assets and I believe also some equity stakes? It is expected that all of it will be returned.
Using it to save people with mortgages would not have been any better either. The same problems would have applied. Who gets it? Youd be helping those that took to great of a risk, and give them the wrongs signals. Getting them to pay back would have also been much harder than with banks.
Interesting subject and very complicated.

How on earth can this post have this many upvotes? 
"It becomes more and more expensive to buy bitcoin, and it becomes more desireable to obtain bitcoin by any means possible."
Tulip mania much? People would just want to buy it for no other reason than that it is more valuable than previously. Not for any fundamentals...
"Now think for a moment; is it better to spend fiat to buy bitcoin, or is it better to sell food for bitcoin?"
What sort of a comparison is this? Is it better to use a raincoat when it rains or eat when youre hungry? They arent mutually exclusive actions. Then you come to the conclusion that "food because you can grown more of it". So you cant make more fiat money? Making food costs time, time which you could have used to do something more productive. Its called opportunity cost.  
Then you have the silly A+B whatever thing. There is no free lunch. If youre currency is deflatorary then youre income will be cut over time in bitcoin terms. So if you at the beginnign earn 1btc/hr then for example in a year it would be 0,5btc/hr. So there that and BTC IS A ZERO SUM GAME. Any gain you make is at the expense of someone else. You could argue maybe that btc is more efficient and therefore enables a small amount of growth but its negligible. Certainly any gain from efficiency is eliminated by the people just sitting on their btc.
"currency deflation encourages sellers to make their products as attractive as possible"
I have no clue where this conclusion comes from. What are you even comparing to? Fiat? Makes absolutely no sense. 
"growth of value encourages older holders to spend more."
Same thing. Where does this come from? Why would old holders be encouraged to spend? They can get more for their btc tommorow. 
And then you have youre last "side effects". As if the problem would be isolated to "disposable consumerist products". Just a soft landing into a more sustainable consumer behaviour, right? Nope. Most people would lose their jobs and it would result in unimaginable huminatarian disaster. And btw, you can thank debt for essentially everything you have, including btc. Technology would be plunged back by even centruries had debt never existed. Debt allows for the efficient allocation of capital. It flows there where its the most productive. Those who have an excess of it, lend it to those who can use it for something that is profitable. In your "model" those who would have the capital would just sit on it, while the people with the ideas wouldnt get anywhere because they dont have the cash.

Only thing I disagreed with was the moneylaundering, tax evasion and financing criminal activity part. While bitcoin has alot of similarities with cash there are several "strengths" for those activities. Borders? No problem.

Cash is physical, and to receive it you need to be there, or have it sent physically to you which is easy to trace or intercept.

TL;DR: Author is full of shit. Productivity magically just appears once there is deflation.
What shitty article. Title said it all, bullshit incoming. When ever anything requires millions to lie for no benefit and in fact they would benefit from telling the "truth", you get a bit skeptical. After all, if you could prove that the deflation does not cause the problems economists say it does and have it stand the test of your peers, a Nobel price might be heading your way. Reminds me of the author that says that the Bush family are alien lizards. "Any expert that tells you differently is in on it. Oh and buy my book." I would be more open minded had the author titled the article "Why Economists are wrong about deflation". 
Ill adress the authoer as "you", dont know if he even reads this...
So first of all, arent there more possible reasons for deflation than increased GDP or "2.  In a fractional reserve system, debt is being wiped out through widespread bankruptcies."? I mean after all, btc's value is increasing and it doesnt seem to have much to do with GDP... 
"Consider that in the first case, this is entirely normal and healthy!  If the money supply is held constant, yet the productive capacity of the economy increases, there will be the same number of dollars chasing more goods.  Inflation is the exact opposite of this, whereby same dollars are chasing fewer goods (or more dollars chasing same/less goods).  Clearly deflation in this sense is beneficial for consumers. We see this taking place in the electronics industry which is largely free from government regulation and subsidies.  When competition is fierce, the productive capacity of industry over-rides the inflationary aspects of our fractional reserve economy and we see prices come down as more and more electronic goods are produced more efficiently.
Imagine if the electronics industry operated like the government subsidized and regulated healthcare industry.  You would buy all the electronics you could now, because in the future, they would be so expensive you might not be able to afford them!  So yeah, in this sense, inflation encourages spending.  But clearly this is UNHEALTHY spending caused by people fearing the loss of their purchasing power."
Completely leaves out most details to suit your logic. You leave out the inconvenient fact about deflation that to keep balance, wages have to come down unless productivity increases are greater than the deflation rate. Your electronics example baffles me, I don't know what it has to do with the whole deflation vs inflation. Its due to high productivity growth compared to other industries -&gt; lower relative prices. Its all relative. 
The you draw this ridiculous comparison to the health industry as if it represents inflation and the electronics industry represents deflation. Again your talking about productivity differences, not inflation or deflation. 
Then there the whole if its inflation it pretty much hyperinflation and if its deflation then it mild. Of course if inflation was 1000% a day Id buy everything I could today but at same time if deflation was 99% a day I would buy nothing.
"Inflation creates a fear based economy that motivates people to spend above their means because the future value of their purchasing power is constantly decreasing."
This theme continues through out the article. That inflation decreases purchase power and implying that deflation increases it. False. Again its all relative. If inflation is 50% a year and my wage increases 100% a year then my purchase power increased. At the same time, if prices decrease 50% and my wages 80% then my purchasing power decreased. Elementary logic. Its all about productivity.
"Krugman’s argument that people would be less willing to spend and borrow, and this would lead to unemployment, is as ridiculous as saying that because computers keep getting better and cheaper into the future, people would be less willing to spend money on a computer today because they could simply wait and buy an even better/cheaper computer in the future.  That is obviously not how people think. "
Every fucking day you can read posts about "Should I wait for Pentium 8000 or buy now?" Its obviously how people think. And no, its not absolute, if someone needs a computer today he will buy one. When theres some flexibility then he will consider which option is more attractive, get something now or the same thing later and cheaper. 
"So let us look at Krugman’s second argument that deflation makes debtors worse off.  What is left unsaid in this assumption is that debt is a good thing, while saving is a bad thing.  Does this make any logical sense to anyone?  Consider that if money is undergoing deflation, SAVERS benefit.  Shouldn’t the savers naturally benefit more than someone who is putting themselves into debt?  Savers are forgoing pleasure in the moment for the expectation of even greater pleasure in the future.  This means resources that could be consumed immediately for minimal productive gains are being put aside into bigger projects that could yield even greater gains in the future.  Savings is what builds strong economic foundations.  If the US wasn’t so wildly in debt at the moment we would be in a better economic position with larger prospects for growth!"
I dont even... What? "What is left unsaid in this assumption is that debt is a good thing, while saving is a bad thing." No it wasnt. Both savings and debt are bad or both are good. And again: its all fucking relative. Too much debt is bad and too much saving is bad and too little debt is bad and too little saving is bad. Debt is good because it allocates capital to where it is most productive, it in itself is not bad but too much and it goes to stuff that is not productive enough and becomes bad and in the case of savings it enables lending but too much and there's too little consumption and production shrinks. 
"Which situation sounds healthier to you?  Low interest rates because a lot of people are saving money or low interest rates because the Fed is artificially depressing them with tax payer money?"
As if the options was were only those or that that question represents the differences between deflation and inflation...
"Your employer gathers up all the employees for a conference and tells you that because the economy is so productive and that the value of money is going up so much, that he is going to have to furlough the workforce to deal with the appreciating currency.
From your perspective, you are getting more time off while your income remains exactly the same in terms of purchasing power.  Who doesn’t want that?  Further, consider that if you don’t get a raise every year, YOU STILL GET A RAISE!  Employers don’t necessarily have to cut wages; they can cut hours or simply not give raises yet people would still be better off than they were the year before."
Now here the article goes completely over the deep end. What a nice question, I mean WHO doesnt want the same amount of PP for less time?! What the actual fuck. Where does this come from? Companies get less revenue, but they dont have to cut wages? Where does this magical productivity come from? Never mind that if you cut hours from the workforce your reducing production...
Then you continue about some magical productivity gains? If there was only deflation the same amount of work would be done in less time!!!! Nirvana indeed!

Thank you for your thought out response. I was some what worried Id get an emotionally charged backlash from the post I made. 
I cant however agree with everything you said. Taxes, regulations and unions are for the poor, not the rich. Not always or without exceptions but generally. If you look at the correlation between the taxrates and income disparity then high taxrate countries have lower income disparity than low tax. See Finland vs US for example.
Also, the industrial revolution was no picnic for the poor and they certainly couldn't afford any luxuries. Over time it has gotten better. And there is absolutely no way that the planet could provide the resources for everyone to live like the average american, never mind like a rich one.
While you might be able to dodge some regulations etc. through the use of BTC you cant all of them. You still need to ship something and thats points where tariffs are paid anyway. So all in all: I think you have it backwards. The rich (like yourself) want no regulations, unions, taxes or trade barriers because it benefits them, not the other way around.

Interesting comparison. However gold has alot more uses than just as currency. Jewelry, leverage, speculation, industrial (not much at this price level). Bitcoin could be used for leverage against inflation but there are plenty of other better options for that (gold).

First, I don't think that they pressure to invest is so great that you would make an above average amount of mistakes while investing. Under deflation you might invest more prudently and wisely in the sense that you would only invest in high return and low risk projects. Obviously there isn't nearly enough of those so the amount investments would drop. 
Let's look at it from an individuals perspective. Say you wanted to buy a machine which you could use to produce something, like tshirts. You would go to the bank and ask for a loan, they would offer it for 5% interest or something. Now you loan 100 bitcoins which are $100 a piece, you buy your machine, setup your business etc. By the time that done the value of bitcoins has gone up, to $1000. The principal on your loan is now 10x larger. Not only that but the amount you get for your tshirts is 1/10 of what it used to be. The investment should never have been made and people know that. The shirts machine company doesnt sell its machine, you dont get self employed, the bank doesn't get the business etc. The rate of deflation is high but easily within the realm of possibilities for bitcoin currently.
b) This is true. Bitcoin is deflatory under the assumption that the economy expands. Some think that bitcoin is immune to inflation but it isnt. One big problem with economics is the inability to experiment. We have exactly one world and one repetition. Therefore it is extremely hard to make analyze causalities. Did we have a crash because of the central bank interference or despite of it? Because we only have reality, it makes solving that question very hard.  Youre at the core question for the fight between Austrian vs Keynesian fight. Im not really an expert on that, but as far I know, Keynesian is winning...
As far as your closing argument. I think it is very clear that central banks are good at stabilizing currencies. Ill just quote myself:
"There is in fiat currencies and that is why have fiat currencies. And that is what central banks do. If there is pressure for the price to rise, the central bank releases currency until that demand is met (and keeping the price stable) and vice verse.
Often central banks let the currency float because that is better than trying to control it too much, but the mere presence of central banks gives people believe in the stability of the currency.
For example, even healthy banks can go insolvent due to bank runs. Bank runs can happen to healthy banks because regardless how the bank does, it is in the depositors interest to withdraw if he thinks others will. That's why we have depositors insurance, to break this inefficient incentive (doesn't always work). Central banks work in much the same way, they give confidence simply by existing because people know that any large fluctuations can be stopped by the central bank so they don't bother panic buying/selling which means that these shocks never happen in the first place!"

@_date: 2013-11-07 17:18:07
Nope. You dont understand how fractional reserve banking works. Example: Person A deposits $100 into a bank. In exchange for keeping it there, he gets paid an interest rate. The bank then lends $90 (keeping $10 as a reserve) forward to person B for an interest rate higher than its paying person A, keeping the difference. B now has $90 which he uses to pay for something to C who deposits the money to the bank. Bank then lends 90% of that $90 and the loop continues until there is $1000 in deposits ($100/reserve ratio). $900 "new" dollars were created. Now person A and C have a combined $190 of money they "could" spend. But really they couldn't. This only works because of the assumption that people dont withdraw their money at the same time. 
Central banks are not needed for this process. Indeed this existed before central banks. You can change the dollar into bitcoins and it still works. No new bitcoins would be printed of course just like no new fiat money. Still technically there is $1000 of money and $900 of debt.
So the problem you are proposing is not solved with bitcoin. Admittedly there is no infrastructure or probably interest for banks to operate. If bitcoin would become more widely used then that demand might be created. Your point is more philosophical than about fiat vs. bitcoin. The debt enables growth which might not be sustainable. However, again debt is only one part of it. Obviously you could have 0 debt and unsustainable growth as well.
