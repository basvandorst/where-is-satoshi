@_date: 2018-05-08 07:04:03
Look out the heavy investors have dropped bitcoin and it will drop 50%.. get out now before you lose all your capital
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:38:14
Wrong if bitcoin drops so do all alts
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:31:24
The thing is if you change to alts, they will go down as well as everything runs on bitcoins price.. good luck hodling lol
@_date: 2018-05-08 06:00:05
It’s about to drop 50% hang on...
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:09:07
Headed for below 5k
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:06:52
The policy in China is Always the to own 51%
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:19:04
And now it will have an upside break to 17k Aud yeh I’d feel bad
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:03:42
Hey no problem bro.. just just don’t forget bitcoin brothers are bros... join the club
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:21:42
Beautiful 
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:16:04
The hold team
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:36:35
Can’t disclose it.. but.. let it be known I am your leader.. and bitcoin will hit 100k trust me
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:23:20
That’s why it’s about to bounce north again lol
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:17:39
Indeed and for the future I’ll let you know that if anyone does buy bitcoin.. and hodl they too will enjoy a fruitful life.. amen
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:53:28
That’s very true indeed. But I just keep the faith silently the best way I can
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:40:38
Off actually ....oh dear another hodler
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:17:36
Bitcoin has almost become a new religion, and I do pray everyday.
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:34:17
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:49:47
Just thumbed you up.. don’t forget we are a very new world of crypto with almost everyone following, if you don’t buy now You will miss out.. remember the great song history never repeats? , but in this case.. just wait
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:05:29
Exactly there is no limit to what we can do
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:21:03
May the force be with you always....
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:20:15
I hate to say it but he’s right, get away from the computer because for now you won’t make any money.. it’s a bear market and Belfort understands markets.. all criminal activities aside, go with gut Instinct, pull out now and wait for the bull market.. then you will be pleasantly rewarded for your patience.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:24:47
I’d say a year and a half but it probably needs to hit 3k first then a bull market..
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:22:51
Tooo the mooooon ! 100k !
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:57:54
In a bear market cutting losses early makes sense as it protects your capital, if it’s too hard to trade in a bear market get out, be patient and wait for the next Bull run.
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:22:14
Cheers bro.. yeh don’t have much but for me I got such faith in bitcoin I’ll put today’s lunch on it...
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:23:41
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:57:17
The whole crypto alts market is a total con.. everyone thinks their alts will move against bitcoin what a con.. bullshit.. everything only moves because bitcoin moves.. and with this in mind .. it sounds like a new found gestapo mafia concept bitcoin themselves have created to make money against us the normal people that earn money... so here’s to you gestpo come and get me ... I’ll be waiting for a public hanging.. for you which will never happen..
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:52:42
It’s going to tank with a dead cats bounce, just pulled all my money from my trading account... 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:52:08
That’s ok bro.. because  if you missed out there is always next time for you
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:49:23
No wrong all alts require bitcoin to jump.. dont forget it.. if bitcoin itself does not make a jump all alts themselves will follow.. don’t get confused. Unfortunately the whole crypto market movement is based on bitcoins movement.. if you move to alts it won’t make any difference unless bitcoin itself moves 
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:16:57
This time it could be much higher than previously, I look forward to watching with my bitcoin brothers and sisters. Peace be upon you always....
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:31:31
 No brother I won’t sell because all my bitcoin brothers want to see the price rise.. so
I’ll still be here for you with faith
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:53:20
Go back to jail loser.
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:42:54
Bitcoin itself keeps society awake, it can see the very reality of what we are all feeling, if you stay with bitcoin, please understand you are with a community that thinks like you and wants you as our friend... we are one, we are bitcoin.. lest we forget,,,dearest friend...
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:41:34
Yes but where is the dividend?
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:10:26
Try below 4.5 k
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:38:15
Well it’s symbolic, if you don’t see a surge upwards like you use to on the last surge, it then looks saggy and not full of motivation... remember all things in life are relative .. and it’s no different with trading and charts.
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:06:11
Then you will thank me when you forgot to buy
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:39:55
Lol, then another bounce.. north.. wait and see lol
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:26:23
Buy at the bottom sell out now because the bottom is a long way off
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:36:20
I’ll have to agree
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:56:29
Well I hope your right... I always like optimists.. they make a world a better place.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:48:38
And it’s growing daily which is why it’s heading north again Today ! Nice one...
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:31:44
Yes that’s true, but if bitcoin itself “steps down” there is no recovery for quite some time.. it’s all about the step down vs the drop,down.. if it steps there is no recovery for quite some time 
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:19:25
Cheers brother. We can do it for sure
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:01:00
I have to agree, and it’s for that very reason I’ll wait for the next bull market 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:40:57
Eh know one knows the true price but I’d say 50 bucks anyway
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:08:15
I always ask the question is bitcoin even worth 50 dollars?
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:59:14
But sadly bitcoin will drop another 10k overnight.. awful to watch
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:31:31
Bitcoin price is regulated by men.. but why would I buy it at 11k when it’s only worth 3k?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:08:39
Yes but this is the biggest crash ever.. a lot more money lost, less money to re inject
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:13:57
Yes they do bitcoin consolidation and heading for 20k Aud 
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:42:00
Bless you and everyone that is is your position, when the stars align again you will be the winner.. bless again.. my friend..
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:30:47
Yes to 2 k everyone has lost faith in investing in something worthless.. reality has just hit.. there are no dividends issued by bitcoin compared to stock bricks and mortar.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:01:52
I’m waiting till it hits 50 bucks
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:24:37
I will.. faith is what we all have.. and I love this community 
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:58:34
RIP Roland our dear friend
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:43:58
Man just lost $5k and it’s still going down 
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:01:02
Yep a good idea for sure 
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:54:37
I love bitcoin.. for me it’s the future!
@_date: 2018-03-02 09:54:30
Until it drops to 3800feet lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:46:36
Bless your words.. heaven will wait
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:26:02
Anytime bro, I’m with you
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:05:08
Well thanks for sharing, yes keep the faith, this crypto has a long way to go.. and it’s only just the beginning, it may take a couple of years for recovery but that’s normal and bitcoins history has proven that.. stay strong and hodl!
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:50:11
Well bless you for that... you know bitcoin itself is the closest touch to humanity which also is very close to God... and our world will see that bitcoin itself is the new “holy world currency” that has the true spirit of all of us together holding hands as one.. bless you.. and bless everyone that invests in bitcoin... Amen..
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:07:19
Another 10k crash I’d say
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:08:38
Well said hats off to you
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:18:10
Not in Australia xao is up 30 points
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:27:26
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:48:03
I’ll have to agree and these very words are holy... bless you
@_date: 2018-03-28 07:42:29
Bitcoin consolidation next level 20k Aud 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:57:14
Haha 10 thumbs up
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:52:23
Interesting but slightly delusional 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:27:37
Delusional 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:14:19
Inflationary 
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:49:53
The future is now
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:14:04
Well I can’t see myself buying bitcoin at 50k, people need to wake up a bit.. after all they forget what they are buying
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:29:16
Indeed we are fighting against the new world order, and our only friend bitcoin is leading the charge.. we fight against the banksters, we fight against the corrupt world as we know it.. a new world currency will eventually dominate because we all know they want control over us.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:22:03
What elements make you cringe?
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:34:42
Bitcoin consolidation poised for 18 dollars Aud 
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:23:00
If you sold out of bitcoin today... well I feel sorry for you.. you just a bucket load of profit 
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:41:09
But little do people realise, bitcoin is the last frontier of investments... eventually the entire world will invest in bitcoin and nothing else... because it represents humanity Avi g as one together.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:16:26
May God bless you and bitcoin always my dear friend 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:06:54
And when you buy when there is blood.. it drops further with more blood.. don’t listen to these so called experts
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:07:03
Well brother we will make it happen then
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:37:25
Art work from God in heaven
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:45:40
I will, time will prove the true value of bitcoin, believe me...
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:08:25
Keep the faith brother.. bitcoin represents our humanity of free speech it’s worth 100k
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:48:22
I quite enjoy watching the sellers sell out of bitcoin at a low price.. because these are the very people that will buy in again at a high price 
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:22:38
Target 17k Aud then a slide up to 30k over the next 2 months
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:22:39
It is but warning sign is that its rising on low volume which means a possible collapse sadly
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:22:53
Bitcoin headed for 5000 now woo hoo enjoy the ride!
