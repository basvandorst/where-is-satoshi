You don't need a previous purchase to make it $5. Perhaps It was my mistake to call it "market" price, I have edited to correct.
Market demand (without any transactions occurring) could have increased the price to $5.

Just two different exchanges. There are tons.
Binance has many coins available. Coinbase has only the "big 4"
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:29:53
You should do a LOT more research before putting your money in.
Its no different than converting your USD into EUR, waiting for EUR to go up, then selling back into USD. Same concept.

I don't think the majority of users get how brilliant this joke is....
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:27:45
it seems you have gotten good information already. I would only add a few minor things:
1) Only because it is worth repeating: Do NOT tell ANYONE the 24 word recovery phrase. That is the master key to your wallet. The money can be accessed remotely using only those 24 words (without the USB drive).
2) The ledger has limited memory and not all wallets can be simultaneously installed on it. Adding/removing a wallet doesn't remove the coins in said wallet. 
If your husband seemed to have a variety of coins then you may wish to install and check all the various wallets. See the Ledger website and ask on the subreddit for help; they are pretty responsive.
3) Also check all the popular exchanges. Try to find out where/how he bought those coins. There is a very real chance that he has accounts (and BALANCES!) on some exchanges. You will likely need access to his email and possibly his phone (Google authenticator) to login. I'm not sure of the process of recovering someone else's account if you don't have access to these, but I imagine it will be a long process (esp given how overwhelmed most exchanges are at the moment).
The learning curve is steep, especially if you aren't familiar with trading nor crypto. I would ask someone you *REALLY* trust. 
Remember, crypto transactions are non-reversible. And be very careful when transferring funds; only send BTC to a BTC wallet address, etc. 
4) Final point because of some bad marketing by some people...BTC (Bitcoin) is NOT the same as BCH (Bitcoin Cash).   Do NOT send BTC to a BCH wallet or vice versa.
Sorry for your loss :(

Your comment has nothing to do with the discussion of a zero-sum game, and you don't seem to understand what a Ponzi scheme is....
what is the point of making this comment?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:16:09
Sure, but that doesn't change the scenario. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:11:32
Trading is not a zero-sum game. Yes, in order to sell someone else has to buy (and vice versa), but the entry and exit points on the market are not equal for all. 
I can buy 1 BTC for $1 and sell it to you a month later for a price of $5. I have profited +$4, but you have not lost -$4. You haven't gained or lost anything at that point, actually.

I am signing up here now, although I still must verify since I don't have any cryptos. 
I've been trying to buy for over a month now, but because of my US Citizenship I have been blocked by every single site that I have tried to sign up with and none of them respond to support tickets.
EDIT: AAAAAAAAaaand NOPE. US Citizens not allowed here either.

Cannot express my  frustration with this bullshit. I just want to trade some goddamn bitcoins.

I understand the hardcap point, thank you.
I guess I need to look up the proof-of-work because I am still completely lost on how miners get coins.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:04:06
I understand that someone can't change the hash after it has been created and confirmed. I wasn't referring to "retroactively" changing the block. 
I am talking about when a ("first") miner creates a new block. This doesn't address how that first miner writes himself in. What is preventing 2 different miners, at the same time, from creating the same block?  
How do we know who was the "first" miner to create a block and why do we trust that first miner? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:31:37
I don't know what a "european id" is, but German IDs are ONLY issued to German nationals. I cannot become a German national until I've lived here for at least 2 years, which is at least 1 more year away for me (plus I have to learn German...).
As far as borrowing, I've already asked my parents since my last message :D

I don't know why I didn't think of this before, duh! Now to setup a VPN....thanks!
Of course, Coinbase does NOT allow a US User to deposit via SEPA/EUR or vice versa.   So now I have to transfer money from my German bank (in EUR) to my US bank (convert to USD), get fucked by conversion fees, and then transfer that USD into CB.... at least its a "solution"

On the one hand, you do need to learn to make decisions on your own by that age.  
On the other hand, if you have to ask a question such as this, you may not be ready for the responsibility. That said, I would invest only a small amount and be prepared to lose it all...
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:39:06
But opening and closing a channel requires an on-tx fee? Or so OP implied that by saying to open our channels now "while the fee is low" - this also implies I should permanently leave my money in that channel to keep it open.
And to open an "incoming" channel, I have to ask someone else to do it for me? I can't actually do it myself. 
And the amount of incoming channel capacity I have is directly reliant on how much money the OTHER person has locked up into the LN? Does that also mean they can close my incoming channel? What if they want to unlock their money?
And what if I want to send my coin to someone that doesn't have LN? Now I have to close the channel?
What if I only want to take part of my money out of the channel and not all of it?
If bitcoin fees do go very high, opening/closing a channel will be just as impractical as sending a direct on-chain tx...no? Or am I missing something here?
I'm still learning a lot about LN, and I strongly support L2 scaling, but I'm not impressed with this system....hopefully there is more to it than I understand so far.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:20:35


Why would I want to lock up my own money into a channel that isn't usable?
@_date: 2019-03-01 08:13:57
Because you are too incompetent to follow the right channels doesn't mean your money has disappeared. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:32:36
No.  On a long enough timeline, the technology will exist to crack private keys, so we will (eventually) be able to recover the lost bitcoin. 
Though there may be a point in time in between where we have lost all bitcoin but we don't have the tech to recover bitcoin yet.

Gotta love the retarded reference to socialism in the quoted comment. 
Its practically a guarantee that if the word "socialism" is used, its used incorrectly.
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:51:33
This is true of many currencies. 
Most notably, KWON (as many of us attempted to during the kimchi premium).  Vietnamese Dong is also heavily controlled (you can convert as much USD to Dong as you like, but you can only convert $200 of Dong to USD at the bank!; at least when I was there several years ago)
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:50:31
Yes and there will not be any. This is due to fiat regulations.
You can buy/sell crypto without verification on Binance and some other exchanges. These will all be crypto to crypto though, as soon as fiat is involved so too are KYC laws. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:01:15
No cryptocurrency requires any kind of identity verification. If you own the crypto, you can send it wherever you like.
Cryptocurrency EXCHANGES \(i.e. where you can buy/sell crypto\) often require this due to AML/KYC laws. This is due to the government regulations involving fiat. There is not much you can do to avoid this, other than buying \(or selling\) the crypto in person for cash.   
This type of service is highly demanded and I'm sure some company will find a way around it in the future, but for now, there is no "easy" way to go from fiat to crypto \(or back\).   Sites like CoinBase \(assuming you are in the US\) are fairly streamlined though; my mom loaded her bank info and bought btc within minutes without needing extra KYC procedures.

I haven't seen or heard of the NY definition being used elsewhere, but, even if it is, this lawsuit is still a giant waste of time and money.
Even if you successfully win in this lawsuit, you will not have -any- affect over laws in other countries. Nor will it prevent the general underlying model from being used elsewhere. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:06:14
This is somewhat hilarious. Your post (and link) don't actually articulate any reasons why you think the rest of the world would adopt NY's model (pure SPECULATION) and instead assert this as "fact" while asking for money. No thanks.
Bitlicense is a (failed) licensing scheme in NY. There is literally NO REASON to think that this licensing scheme will be used "as a model" in the rest of the US and/or world considering how badly it was implemented.

I woulnd't hate on coinbase if anything from their service worked.
Coinbase App: Shows 10% lower price than is actually being traded on GDAX and if you initiate a buy you will be surprised when that 8100 btc/eur just cost you 8800
Customer service: 4+ weeks ago "an account specialist will contact you shortly"
Change country: 
FAQ says "go to settings"; oh wait, thats wrong your country is forced based on your IP settings.  
FAQ says "if the auto detect is wrong, click here to update your country"; oh wait, thats wrong, it takes you to the ID upload page and after uploading your ID it says "successful but you cannot be verified because your ID is from another country" NO SHIT. Thats why I want to change my fucking country.

Depends on the law.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:44:28
GDAX charges 0.25% for market takers and 0% for market makers.  
Most exchanges have below 0.4% fee and most exchanges only charge market takers (or give a discount to market makers).

Pure lulz. Bad customer service is not equal to robbing people.

@_date: 2018-07-27 15:56:25
that is not entirely correct.  I am nowhere near the cap and make under 100k/yr (it caps around 54% I believe). 
Housing is also not cheap, especially here in Munich (or any major city center). It is very comparable to housing in major metropolitan areas of the US.  Of course you can find cheap housing outside of the centers, but you can also find that in the US.
Overall, I would have rather grown up in this system. But it is difficult to transition to it coming from the US with that insane law school debt...
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:25:44

It is not a pure socialist country, but Germany has some of the strongest socialist principles...this is -extremely- well known.
Education? Healthcare? Labor? Pension? Tax system? Housing regulations? Ag subsidies? Municipalities? Govt benefits for pretty much anyone who needs them? Even the public television...Why do you think we have 50%  income tax? I pay 45% currently and I'm not at the cap.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:46:14
Honestly, if you grow up here its not so bad because there ARE a ton of benefits.  Imagine finishing grad school with no student debt....
BUT, as an unmarried, single American that moved here (with massive student loans and having already finished law school in the states)....I get almost none of those benefits (the healthcare IS amazing though).  If I had a wife and kids, they would all get the benefits as well without any additional costs.....but I don't have any of those.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:47:22
Did you understand my example above?
Year 1 - Buy property. Worth 10k.
Year 2 - Worth 20k.
Year 3 - Sell property. Worth 30k.
I can \*EITHER\*:
\ When doing my taxes in year 2, I can just leave the property as-is. This essentially rolls-over any gains to year 3. Thus, when doing my year 2 taxes, I pay NO GAINS on the property. If I do this, when I do my year 3 taxes, the property was worth 30k at sale.....it was wroth 10k at its last taxable event. The difference is a gain of 20k on which I must now pay taxes. I pay taxes on the entire 20k gains in year 3.
\ I can account for the gains in year 2 by declaring a 10k gain. I realize the 10k gains on the property in year 2 (from 10k to 20k) and I pay taxes on the 10k gains (thats what "realizing" the gains means - you paid taxes on it).  If I do this, when I do my year 3 taxes, the property was worth 30k at sale....it was wroth \*\*20k\*\* at its last taxable event. The difference is a gain of 10k on which I must now pay taxes. I pay 10k gains worth of taxes in year 2 and 10k gains worth of taxes in year 3.
"Realization" is a \*very basic\* concept in taxation. 
In most cases, a sale forces a realization, but a sale is not REQUIRED to realize P/Ls.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:44:42
because all law schools cost more or less the same and they all blatantly lie about employment numbers and post-graduation salaries....
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:34:25
That's not what "realized" means.
 In my above example, the 10k gains were realized when you paid taxes on 20k in the second year. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:49:34
You don't seem to understand how taxes work.
I do not need to make a sale or transfer to realiz ا profits or losses on capital. Plain and simple. If I do make a sale, I HAVE to realize the P/L, but there are ways to realize tit without a sale too. 
If I buy capitol at 10k this year and next year it is worth 20k. I can EITHER claim the original 10k value on year 2 and rollover the increase value to the third year OR I can claim the value at 20k and pay taxes on the 10k profit. If I do that, then the next year when I do my taxes, I have to consider the capital as of its change in value since year 2 (20k).  However if I rolled it over, then I consider the value as of year 1 (10k).
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:22:42
Mine will be "forgiven" after 25 years, but that is considered "income" so I must pay income tax on it. According to current calculations, my total "forgiven" amount, thanks to the absurd 7-9% interest rate, will be approximately $1-1.2Million dollars.  
Which means I must pay tax on $1M income, which is $350,000+. So, when my loans are "forgiven" the IRS will come after me for $350k on the spot. At 60 years old, I will have to declare bankruptcy thanks to the loan "forgiveness".
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:02:26
Why do I need to wash trade? Why can't I just realize the losses like I could with any other capital? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:10:33
At 7-9% interest for a student loan? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:51:13
You can't get rid of student loans through bankruptcy except in extremely limited circumstances. I generally do not qualify for debt forgiveness either, although I have reached out to some specialists to see if my case is "extreme" enough to qualify (so far, the concensus is that it is not). 
Looking into private loans is my next step but unlikely to qualify. :(
Thanks. It's certainly destroyed my will to work towards my future since I feel like there won't be one no matter what.

Facepalm. Taxes. It's called doing your taxes. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:27:58
Again, a sale is *one way* to realize it, but it's not the only one. I am not disagreeing that a sale is an example of how to realize. You can *choose* to realize them without a sale.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:48:33
Do you think you need to sell your other capital to realize P/L on them? No, you don't.   
I can realize P/L on other capital I own without selling it (e.g. on a property), OR I can let those P/Ls ride into next year without realizing them. Why can't I do the same for crypto? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:21:33
That's what I'm asking!
