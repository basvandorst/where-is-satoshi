Same here. Here is my proof [
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:16:09
And really, I'd like to setup some limit orders for when I'm away. No it's not jail I'm going to, but a hospital.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:48:16
Yeah. My nerves are gonna get to me not knowing the price for a month. I'll possibly just setup a daily dca purchase for a month. Probably the best way to go about it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:44:45
Youll have the same amount of BTC As you have RIGHT NOW!
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:34:19
Damn bro me too. Had I stayed on BTC ever since the first 1000$ bubble, my life would be so much different now. I bought in at 140, sold at 800, and never took another look until now. :(
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:33:33
Did I just get lucky with this transaction then? Just slipped right in 2 days ago! [ Although strangely, I cant import it into coinbasepro just yet. And it's gone out of my Wells Fargo account. I can't open an account with any other banks due to a stupid check error a few years back.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:10:51
That also sounde very stupid, like imagine all the business theyre missing out on. It harms them more than helps them. Fucking bullshit. Probably because they're a second chance bank.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:30:33
We can all wish can't we lol. Idek why I made this post, since nobody knows. I'll setup some sell orders at 19k just in case though.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:45:23
Looks like the freefall stopped at 10k.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:06:53
Is the price almost guaranteed to go up at that time? Or down?
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:07:33
Frost/Horizon are online banks? How do you load money on it? Also how can they deem you purchased Bitcoin, simply by loading it into coinbase?
@_date: 2019-07-06 19:54:33
When is the next halving gonna happen?
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:53:50
I can't open an account anywhere else unfortunately. Do you know of any other banks that don't use the Chexsystems? I have a stupid debt from YEARS ago, where I owe money to a bank. It was an error on my part but still.
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:00:40
I just signed up for a Capitol One 360 Checking account and put in $550. What does that mean for me?
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:11:11
Actually, I ended up coming back sooner than expected. And I see that the price hasn't exactly gone up quite as well as I thought it would have. Oh well, Ill still be a HODLER for life.
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:06:00
Yes. Idek where I was going with this post.
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:58:33
Well, turns out It wasn't as bad as I thought it would've been. And I'm glad to see the price didn't tank after 5 days lol.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:48:50
I believe you'll be right.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:42:10
If it was taken out of your bank account, youll be able to buy BTC on the coinbase site. You just wont have it to move elsewhere for a few more days. Im in the same boat, but I managed to get a good price, and by the time its ready to move youll be ok.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:06:28
Thanks, ll check it out. Just dont know how Ill put money into it. Maybe just a bank transfer? I wont have any fees on wells fargo as long as I keep my balance above 1500.

This is EVERY bank and credit union in the US, it's  a federal regulation (D) that limits savings account transfers. If you go over 6 you get hit with a fee and a bounced transfer.

Oh man!

No. Although you could write a script with coinbase running.

I honestly think 500 isn't even close to how low it will go. I'm thinking like 300's in a couple of months.

Hey I made a donation of .002 btc, yet it says there was an error because I actually sent more than my total. Any idea what's up with that?
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:35:47
That's the type of mentality that is causing the price to drop.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:33:04
Just checked, didn't see anything allowing me to make a deposit via bank, only a coinbase or a address deposit. I do see that you can withdraw into a bank account directly from Pro.
@_date: 2019-11-23 17:27:51
Great plan.
@_date: 2019-11-09 06:03:26
You think this man  a lot of bitcoin that he can sell it all or something? I really doubt this man alone can even get the price to drop $200.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:54:44
Could've gotten 30% off.
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:42:30
You can't actually buy bitcoin on pro. You have to deposit the bitcoin into pro from your coinbase account first, meaning, you still have to buy on coinbase. The trading fees are much lower on pro though, so you're right there.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:53:08
Of course, why would not banning mining affect the price?
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:57:50
I believe in coinbase offers credit card to bitcoin transactions, though they charge it as a cash advance, which is not something you wanna do.

Wtf is Bakkt and why should I care?
@_date: 2019-10-02 22:57:41
What I'm more concerned about is the fact that your atm did not have a deposit confirmation screen, where it asks you if the deposit amount was correct. Like today I went to deposit some money into my bank account, and it asked me if the amount I deposited was correct. You must have glanced over it thinking it was correct, or your atm is very outdated simply depositing whatever you have put in. Can you reply back with which one it was? Also what bank do you use?
Actually never mind, I re read your original post and just realized this post makes absolutely no sense in regards to yours. It said there was an error after confirmation?
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:09:34
He meant responsibility... obviously

Here's an idea, why don't you try logging back into that old coinbase account? And also, why did you 'close' that account anyway?

@_date: 2019-10-29 19:05:21
You gotta look at the prediction, not all the dates coincided perfectly to the real value to bitcoin at the time, it doesn't have to happen within 3 days, a month error is fine as well.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:04:56
Only had left overs in that coinbase account of .0636. Which was pennies when I left it in there. It's a come up either way. I'll wait till the price goes down a bit before I buy again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:02:58
When it hits 10300 again or less I will. You know how volatile this shit is mirite?
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:25:41
Are you talking about Coinbase's account recovery? Because mine went without a hitch, and I had a crack in my driver's license which made it hard to photograph without getting rejected. And my oh my, how MUCH xrp are you talking about exactly?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:28:55
If only I still had the 10btc I bought for 1400 in 2013. Heh oh well.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:30:29
Of course, !! I only had a few bucks worth of coins in that account when I left bitcoin for good. Life happened. I got access again and found a nice sum in there.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:05:25
Bought my .0525? Nice!
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:27:52
Nope. It was in my old coinbase account that had literally 3 bucks in it at the time. I sold for 600. I'll be going back in when the times right. I should've sold at 13.3 the other day, around the time I got access to that account again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:27:41
WHy not coinbase?
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:42:23
@_date: 2019-12-18 10:58:07
Yeah, I figured it out. You first have to go on coinbase and deposit USD into your wallet, then transfer it to coinbase pro. The only downside to this is, if you buy from coinbase, and the price changes against your favor, then you're out a few %.
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:34:00
Was it a bad actor in 2012? When it allowed millions of people a quick and painless way to buy bitcoin? I think they allowed a very HUGE audience into the game. Don't think they have an interest AGAINST bitcoin, that would be financial SUICIDE!!

What you should've done when bitcoin his 9950 a few weeks ago, just wait until it went below 9950, or as close to it as possible, like yesterday when it hit 10280, you would've only lost a few %. Another tip, if you're going to trade, is only sell at the higher peaks, and buy at the dips. What you did was PANIC SELL, don't do that.

As bitcoin is semi-anonymous, it would mean that he would be concerned if he knew whose wallet that was.

Can you get a little deeper into this?
@_date: 2019-09-16 06:42:57
I'm not sure. Its maybe some kind of anti fraud thing with coinbase. I used 2 different accounts to transfer into cb, and each time it took 12 days.

You're thinking as if Coinbase isn't a US company, with a massive insurance policy, and it's also covered under the FDIC for any money you have in there. Sure they can stop withdrawals, but at that point I think bitcoin has much bigger problems.

@_date: 2019-09-16 06:38:28
Yes, transactions over 10k should've reported. But I'm just wondering how can they know what price you've bought them at vs sold? So it could be at a loss, are they still going to report that to the IRS?

I actually got kinda screwed by coinbase taking too long. I bought 10BTC at 143 for $1450, and just today it decided to withdraw from my bank, there was no way to cancel my order. I won't even receive my coins for a few hours. And lucky me lost my wallet with my debit card so I couldn't just withdraw all my cash until the transaction failed. I shall wait and see haha.
