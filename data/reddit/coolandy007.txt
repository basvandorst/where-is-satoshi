I'm just going to point out that's pretty much the default move in the world. Holding Fiat. The fact that you're questioning that along with HODLing is ironic and amusing to me.   
We're in a new age kids. No one gets burried with their Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:43:37
I'm not even generalizing with people that have an opposing view and have valid points based on data or logic at least, but when someone just shows up on the daily discussion and says "Don't put your money here" and nothing else, it's a a foken waste of time for EVERYONE. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:16:17
There's something so interesting about people that come on a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin to tell you to not invest in Bitcoin. What's your motivation? I'm legitimately curious.

Any chance this dip might have something to do with the fact that the 4th quarter is getting started and people are making moves? Hopeful me talking here, but the fact it didn't drop bellow the 6K support that everyone was so happy for less than a month makes me think we gonna be aight! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:24:04
Thanks man, I wanted to post so I could polish the idea with people challenging it, but I'll take a little positivity too. Good Times. If you try it and it works out for you, let me know.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:44:57
Right, but even then, I feel this stands it's ground as a solid Bitcoin investment strategy that minimizes the feeling of loss when we have drops like the one we are watching now and keeps everyone from freaking out and selling in panic.   
The incentive here is not to earn as much reward as possible in a short time. Instead, it is a way to safely invest on a realistic way of microscopically raising the market cap by "throwing away" $5 USD a week just like we normally do on other bullshit. Minimize the feeling of loss, and you could theoretically minimize the amount of Sell fluctuation in the market by removing the fear of loss element. In my humble opinion of course. Good Times.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:51:35
Dude, that's awesome. I unfortunately ran into people trying to introduce it to me like it was the next HerbaLife. It wasn't until recently I was shown the tech and the philosophy by a buddy. I wish I had started early, but the fact that I didn't has helped me deal with the rollercoaster a lot better. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:10:04
That's a solid argument, I will point out that every day transactions and word of mouth (redditt included) a basically the outlined form of early dissemination for Bitcoin regardless of what the whales do and try. You still pick up a $20 in the street regardless of what Warren Buffett is worth right? If you're HODLing, and you're not in for a quick buck, then the money invested into it shouldn't backfire on anyone with patience that's hasn't gone "tulip crazy" and sold their first born for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:32:53
Not really, but you can't deny it is a step in the right direction.
It helps the whole system get a little closer to that by highlighting an accessible, flexible and painless avenue of investment for almost everyone that might not have the ability to put a large sum in all at once.
Maybe you're able to put down the $4 billion down yourself, I don't know if you got that kind of money, but if you're like me and you don't, then maybe a more conservative investment plan might work for you, something like what I'm suggesting?
A plan that minimizes the danger or losing your rent money while allowing for the potential of large growth on your investment is not a bad plan. even if it's not the solution to everything.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:04:05
Doesn't that work though? The bucket gets a $4.5M drop every Monday, regardless of what happens to rest of it, that money stays because it's literally like a $5 dollar "loss" to every individual involved so no big deal. You won't miss it right? And the bucket keeps filling up drop by drop.
Great analogy, you didn't think I was going to grab it and spin it positively like a boss huh? lol!  
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:30:23
The main thing is not so much getting someone to put the $5 in, the issue is coordination. I feel like there's potential for that here in Redditt, but I'm going to propose it to everyone I can lol. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:38:57
Phenomenal point. I guess the idea here is based on my simplistic interpretation of Fractals.   
If at the smallest levels, we are creating a solid base, could we not infer that the larger model would retain properties and solidify as well? 
I mean, plenty preach intelligent adoption as opposed to promoting the gambling high of day trading anyway right? It seems to be the consensus here the majority of the time lol. What's really stopping us from organizing something like that? We're all reading it, and it's such a passive investment that plenty foked up charities have made their foken living off that same model right? Why not invest that money on yourself instead of coffee or whatever? 
For only pennies a day, you too can make a highly volatile investment without the angry regret of wasting your rent money and the plausibility of large returns....
Anyone able to research can find whatever information they want and can interpret it however they see fit, but what I gathered so far is that Bitcoin can be a solid investment if done intelligently over a long period of time, and since it's money that you are setting aside without noticing (like the Acorns app, You're welcome Acorns lol), there will come a time where it doesn't hurt to move it around with micro transactions that make the system even healthier anyways, right?
I'm new to this whole thing, I've read around, but maybe I haven't run into these answers yet, and if that's the case I apologize.   
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:37:35
If I'm reading this right, and that's sarcasm (I can't tell because I'm on MY side of the screen) then please elaborate how and why that's a "brilliant idea".
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:30:23
I wish everyone would. Without getting overtly preachy I've gotten a couple friends to participate and so far they love it. They aren't freaking out about the dips because they're investing just a trickle at a time. But the excitement when they realize they've put $100 in and then watching that foker go up and down it's damn near priceless. I just keep saying stick to it and don't fall to greed. That's what foks you up and makes you bitter towards one of the greatest things that's happened in our lifetime!  
It's a great foken plan, lol. I'm just saying.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:46:35
Life is so Blockchain like, that is checking the math on this "blockchain" and can correct it for us... Elaborate please.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:22:30
As said, the issue is coordination. Maybe it's easier for someone to buy $5 a week than $20 all at once. And maybe instead of trying to shake the whole building all at once, we just quietly lay down very solid "small bricks" on the foundation.   
Again, if everyone subscribed here did $5 every Monday, that's a $4.5 Million dollar pump every week and you never gave your $5 dollars to a third party or anything like that. You invested in your future in the safest way possible because it's a $5 dollar a week throw away habit that you won't regret if you lose, but will surely enjoy if you make some profit on. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:57:40
I still would like to know how that's a bad thing. Please enlighten me. 
Not one ounce of sarcasm here.
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:18:27
Like, it reminds me of those "Don't buy gas on Monday" protests. You've accomplished nothing you fools. Except hurt the poor owner for the day, maybe more.   
You want to drive down gas prices, you get EVERYONE to buy only AND only Gas A till Gas B lowers their price enough to be competitive lower at which point everyone switches till A goes down.   
You'd think the incentive of a larger overall gain would be enough for people to want to organize better...
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:51:00
OH, my decision has been made. 
I'm following this formula I'm proposing because it foken works. I would like everyone to adopt something similar that fits their specific budget. 
The name of the game right now is propagation. I'll soapbox this in every platform available because I believe in it wholeheartedly. 
We have the realistic potential to change the world with this new technology and I think passing the word along will ensure everyone has an opportunity to not miss out.
If they do, it's because of their own choices. Not ours, not the banks, no one to blame except your fear of change lol. 
 
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:48:30
It's very encouraging to hear that because I'm pretty new to the investing game, but this philosophy seems to get very positive response. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:37:38
Why do you keep assuming things about me, like what I do or don't do with my BTC.   
And now you want to give me advice on something you just said I should jump ship from?   
Your problem isn't Bitcoin buddy, you need to figure out yourself first.  
Good Times.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:07:42
I might be wrong, but I look at Bitcoin as a volatile investment so I only put in money I'm not afraid to lose ($10 from every paycheck) and I leave it there. That's allowed me to do 2 things.
1) With a "Set it and Forget it" mentality, I forget I "wasted" $10 USD on bitcoin from my paycheck. Except this "waste" is not as bad as let's say my subscription to Star Wars the Old Republic. I only played with that every once in a while and it didn't have the possibility of making me more money lol. 
2) I've put away enough throw away $10 dollar bills to now make Bitcoin transactions with others when I have the opportunity so I'm not just HODLing, I'm actively participating in the transfer, use, and propagation of a technology I believe in without really exposing the majority of my investment. Started small. HODLed. Can buy coffee and other shenanigans with it when possible without freaking out about it. If the shop accepts Bitcoin, I'm not afraid to pull my wallet out and it makes my friends that have heard me talk about it more curious. 
Furthermore, I didn't invent this to benefit from it, I'm simply proposing a possible answer to a volatile market and an incentive to anyone that's afraid to invest in Bitcoin because of the very real possibility of loss. My "gain" is simply strengthening my investment by proposing a less risky approach to investing in Bitcoin and seeing the value of my investment slowly grow in the long term (emphasis in LONG TERM). 
If this picks up speed and strength, awesome. If it dies after this comment, I've lost nothing. I'd say that's a smart investment.   
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:04:15
In my very limited knowledge, I feel like any good investment portfolio should contain some Cryptocurrency. Off that, the large majority should be Bitcoin and then a small percentage on other Alt coins.   
Bitcoin is the Meat and Potatoes, Alt coins are the herbs and spices in my humble opinion.   
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:55:55
I can't remember, but there's a name for when we use a brand new system in the same way as the system as we had before even when it's not meant to work that way.
It's still early enough that cryptos will be used and abused by the wealthy and the banks and that's not going to stop because human greed is a fact, however, there are checks and balances in the technology and the model if I'm understanding it right.
Decentralization, stops on double spending, smaller or non existent transfer fees, proof of work, microtransactions...  these are the small advantages that allow average Joe to partake on the pie right?
Except this time the pie isn't hidden away in the federal reserve being inflated and manipulated without our knowledge. This time you don't have to put your piece in a building and receive pie vouchers while the bank charges someone else to borrow your pie. This time we are watching the pie being baked before our very eyes, and we can add to the recipe or maybe even make a better pie and share news about the pie with others so they get pie too. 
Look at Turkey and Venezuela right now. Broken economies that could benefit from adopting crypto. No bank could save those places or would want to, but Bitcoin can help and it's becoming a source of major relief for the poorest of the poor.

I wish I had an answer for your question, maybe someone else reading does.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:07:24
I believe in this Tech. I'm sure I'm in the Bitcoin sub, why wouldn't I suggest it here?
It's literally $5 Dollars a week per individual. If that hurts your wallet, try less. If you don't like Bitcoin, use the suggested model on whatever YOU want. I'm not stopping you or whining about your life choices.
Also, how is a theoretical $4.5M pump and hold every Monday not raise the market cap a little bit each time? Clarify that for me if you can. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:10:52
Right on. I was surprised how accessible it can be for someone on a budget. The name of the game is mainstream adoption. Earning profits is just an awesome byproduct when into you invest intelligently.

Thanks man, that's awesome!
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:29:05
I agree with the fact that the change is microscopic to say the least, that I will not argue with at all, but.....
Isn't it downright silly to say that there's absolutely no effect from trickling funds into an investment? 
I'm not appealing to the elite, I'm proposing a very modest investment model for Average Joe. I mean, how many people here have the ability to move the needle on their own? 
I'm not trying to shake the building with a large dump, I'm saying we can lay down a solid foundation at the ground floor without investing more money than we would waste a week on coffee or fast-food. If it works, awesome, lambos and moons and all that shit. If it doesn't, then all you lost is the same amount you would have wasted on McDonalds or whatever when compounded over time.
Furthermore, it hasn't been a waste for me watching my throw away money go up and down on this rollercoaster. I've made profits, I've managed to use it when I've needed it, I've even been pissed when it's dropped below certain lines, then I remember buying Starbucks on Monday wasn't making me ANY money at all so I chill the fok out and sip my tea like Kermit. 
There's volatile investments everywhere, I like Bitcoin and I want to participate, but I can't afford to lose a lot of money at once. How do I approach it? These are the questions I asked myself:
1) For someone making a living wage, can I afford a $5.00 investment a week?
2) If I am throwing $5.00 away on bullshit already (most of us are), why not switch to an investment that at least has the potential to grow?
3) If 10 years from now, I've made any profit, I mean ANY at all, would I consider that a gain? If 10 years from now, I've lost it all, would I consider that a loss? (Please keep in mind, theoretically, this would have been a "$5.00 dollars being used on other bullshit" investment)
4) Supposing everything goes to shit, will I have learned any lessons on investments, technology, money management, etc? Can these lessons be used to make myself a better person and help others?
I felt if I could answer YES to those questions, then the approach was safe at the the individual level and had the ability to make tangible changes if organized at a large scale. 
One beaver and a branch won't do shit, but enough beavers will change the flow of a river right?
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:30:12

It's a solid opinion, and I agree. I proposed a safe investment model yesterday because of that same way of thinking.I don't want to miss out, but I can't afford to lose a lot, how do I approach it?  
$5 dollar buy every Monday instead of a coffee!  
Boom. Foken Genius!  
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:52:52
Definitely not an expert here, I'm reading more on it, but it seemed plausible in theory. I do have to question the "fake science" part though. Not trying to fish for credentials, just curious if you can state this with certainty. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:42:05
Well, if this hasn't been proposed before, then I hope it becomes the seed for it.   
We know that Blockchain tech is helping solve the coordination problem to some degree, so maybe the answer is here somewhere.   
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:19:40
I'm not begging for anything, I'm proposing a solution.  
I haven't lost a dime I wasn't prepared to lose.   
I have a fairly balanced portfolio, but figured I can use DISPOSABLE income to make  a risky investment on something I actually believe in.  
Because it's my foken money.
I'm sorry you're having a shitty day.
Enjoy following the herd.   
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:42:36

Be careful how much you put in. You said it's money you "set aside", please don't do it if it's your life savings or something like that lol.   
Only, and only invest with money you don't need and won't miss. This is a rollercoaster, and it might be for a little while. I love the tech, I love the ideals, I absolutely HATE seeing people come in excited about lambos and moons and then literally lose their shit when things get bumpy.
I'm not saying that's your case, but if it is, heed this warning lol.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:21:38
I feel like this strategy works for people like me that don't want to miss out, but don't have a really "flexible" budget. I wish I could throw Millions into this without worrying about it, I can't, but I'm definitely not going to lose my shit over a $5 every week.   
I believe in the Tech, I love the Satoshi mistery, I want to be a part of it, and my budget shouldn't limit my ability to do so. That's like literally embedded in the philosophy, in my opinion lol.   
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:11:36
Funny, I've always thought that if Bitcoin was a pyramid scheme, it would be the greatest pyramid scheme EVER.I feel that it would literally try to sell us Utopia....If it works, if it ALL works perfectly, you could get to the point of Star Trek level of commerce. I'm not super nerdy on Star Trek, but I remember that there where different economic systems but the Federation's was almost magical. Commerce moved along but money wasn't exchanged. Goods and services where sold and those transactions just happened in the background. Like if Bitcoin wallets where just continuously operating on everyone's tricorder or whatever.
That's the dream I feel could be sold if Bitcoin was a Pyramid Scheme.

I guess this is more for anyone that does not have access to a lot of disposable income or is afraid of investing.   
A small amount makes it more accessible and ultimately, propagation and adoption is the name of the game right?
I feel better about putting $10 USD from every paycheck into Bitcoin than buying $20 at once even if it's the same thing lol. I guess I'm trying to hack my spending psychology.   
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:00:30
And that's they point. It won't hurt the wallet and it's accessible to almost anyone. Hell, you want to take it a step further, let's say you can afford an extra $5 this month; why not start a wallet for someone as a gift to get them started?
