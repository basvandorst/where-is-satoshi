It’s just your government has made unreasonable promises and that debt is denominated in your currency. They’re likely to “bail out” their bad decisions by printing money (taxing you) to pay for things that you had no choice  or vote in making.
We need a decentralized currency that no central authority has control over, one that the end users control. 
My kids shouldnt have to be put into debt because we decided to go to war, give out entitlements, etc.

Humanity is redefining what money is. Why would I want to take on counter party risk, political risk, inflation risk when holding a political currency?
Everything, imo, is going to be repriced. Once confidence is lost in a currency, it’s over. Bitcoin has more credibility in its monetary policy than any centrally controlled money. 
How can we continue to run trillion dollar deficits? Especially when we’re starting trade wars with our biggest creditor.  This debt is mathematically impossible to repay, so the government has 2 options.
1. Default and talk to creditors about restructuring/cut entitlements. Seems unlikely imo given the president’s agenda and unwillingness to compromise.
2. Fed printing press. Print money, and socialize the losses via inflation. Why would someone want to hold a currency that is likely to be massively debased? Humanity is waking up. 
Defining the risk free asset is the most important calculation one can make, and currently most define that as federal reserve notes. It is the basis for which all financial calculations are based upon, and I think the market is wrong. Bitcoin, within 30 years, will be the risk free asset. That’s my bet.

Relative to other currencies. Global currency market cap is around 80-90T.
Bitcoin obviously needs to overcome significant hurdles, but I believe it’s far better money than state currencies. 
The current illusory financial system has no way out of the mess created by central banks and fractional reserve lending. It’s a matter of time before loss of confidence in the dollar.

Exactly. 
It’s just why trust usd as money over bitcoin? It’s harder to take custody over usd notes than bitcoin.
I see more and more people begin to trust bitcoin after learning about money and it’s history. Once they understand that “money” in their bank account is an IOU subject to counter party risk in a system that’s unstable, they start questioning what money is and what to trust.

Because you’ll get products for cheaper if merchants aren’t taxed 5% on every transaction. 
And it only exists if it’s in your actual wallet, but if it’s in a bank account it’s lent out to someone else.

Great read if interested in monetary history.

Thanks for the conversation.
Good luck to you as well.

No it relies on the fact that 2 + 2 is 4.
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:39:42
Yeah and everyone should be free to choose which money they want to use. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:03:46
Exactly. I’m willing to lose everything, and also willing to dump half of every paycheck into bitcoin. It’s so undervalued.

I can verify that gravity actually exists by walking around. I can’t verify that the “money” in my account actually exists other than on a bank’s database. Credit card rewards are silly, they’re like merchant taxes that they pass on a portion of to the consumer to incentivize usage. 
If your financial institution makes bad lending decisions you lose your money, sorry. Or even worse, the fed prints money to socialize the losses so that you’re not hurt; moral hazard

Out of curiosity, do you hold any bitcoin? And why do you believe in dollars?

Yep getting a second job to accumulate for the next couple of years

He hasn’t sold a single bitcoin and probably never will. He’s a billionaire already.
