I guess it depends on how the original BTC were acquired. Did you pay cash, did you submit ID to a "registered" company to purchase, do you trade on a market?

If not terrorism she would had simply used child abduction, flesh trade, drugs. Any interchangeable fear based word.

BTCjam seems legit
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:23:29
Yup. I need to find that website. I think I book marked it. Need to check other pc
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:17:34
ok, here is the url for that app.
Is this legit?
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:12:18
Gotcha, thanks for splaining' that, however; I just visited bitpremier and saw some prices there. It could happen. 
One word - wow!
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:11:40
i considered that. looks legit :-/
Will look again

I don't get it
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:10:10
I don't code. Want to know if larger blocks or hard fork errodes away at de-centralization. This I believe should be preserved at all costs. Higher fees - so what. Slow down - so what. The purpose is to keep the banks out of this.
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:36:39
Gawd, if I knew what I know now when I was 21, I'd love to be in a place like this. Great idea, I believe incubators can be like this without the stress of having to live with other that one may or may not like.

Thx in advance
@_date: 2012-06-21 22:25:58
good deal...
@_date: 2012-08-12 20:16:07
Not sure. Though it has less to do with price than I'd like to be able to meet in person with the individual as needed. Since I'll already be there. 
Though this was my idea with the last web designer (and 1st) and it turned out to be a horrible business relationship i.e., she was always late, no replies to inquires, excuses ad naseum. It had more to do with the individual than the project
@_date: 2012-06-21 11:55:07
after reading reading this last post re dwolla and account suspension it reminded me of the SS number issue for me. i don't feel comfortable giving it out over the net or a faceless company such as dwolla. are there other options to dwolla that do not require this. maybe an asian bank / company.
for me its about it's not anyones businesses if i transfer 9 bucks from a to z

Now I'm like fuck her, not that i would

Thanks, this is what I was looking for
@_date: 2012-08-12 19:59:23
I find this surprising. I was going to get some professional help while there to develop the website. I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to get the ball rolling. I've very much enjoy doing this. I've lived there before. Nope, I'm not Indian just married to one.
@_date: 2012-03-02 02:54:38
Thank you
@_date: 2012-08-12 19:51:10
Wow, that's some very fast responses. Much appreciated. I'm headed to  India for some months, perhaps longer.
As for withdrawal plans, I've been on r/bitcoin for about a year and reading the wiki, I recall seeing options. Though I need to refresh my memory. I already have bank accounts in India and believe I should be able to convert the Bitcoins through MtGox and into a bank for rupees.
I most definitely will practice creating the wallet and transferring them out of there. This is a very good reminder point.
I do need to get started though because I plan on incorporating bitcoins into my business. I'm an auctioneer (bid calling) developing an online site. I'd like to offer the items up for auction to be available for purchase with bitcoins as well.

I wanted to send 400 buys to NY and they wanted to charge 37.
I once sent 2000 to India and it cost me 175 and this was the least expensive method.
I have no interest giving away fees associated with 5 digits. For me it's more about principal and what I believe is legal theft by corporations
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:00:15
I'm lost on how to use this wallet. As a test I sent a tiny amount to the wallet. How do I now send it to another address?

Excellent question. I had heard about BTC sometime ago and thought "ehhh whatever" Then recently my interested was regained. 
There appears to be ALOT of potential in bitcoins when it comes to wealth. Think, ground floor opportunity, however; I'm pretty keen on the the idea of a decentralized unmanipulated monetary system
@_date: 2011-08-22 07:30:14

I like the idea of bitcoins for a couple of reason at the moment, however; what gives with this "prediction".  Is this subject a reasonable  prediction or is this a near sighted hypothesis?

I set up a store and then needed to set up a second client bc of switching to another pc. It's basic but does the job.
To be full time on it one would need to have it hosted. Otherwise client only works when you are connected which i learned.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:13:40
Funny, i was thinking the same thing. Did a search and found this post.  As long as I can still use a Bitcoin to buy from evolution I'm fine. Had someone tell me today Bitcoin are going away for good. I  Rolled my eyes

I understand why they would be checking IP addresses, however; as a VPN user this would work against me. After reading all this about Coinbase I'm not feeling as likely to become a customer. Even if they make things right at the very end. 
I'll be watching this thread to see how they handle this. I would be as pissed as throwaway-o too.
I can understand why people make throwaways for NSFW posts but for bitcoins???
