That's a good example of an area Satoshi didn't forsee.  He talked about a country with 1/10th the hashing power - not China having 68% of hashing power.  
I think it's fair to ask those who disagree with Satoshi's ideas to justify their view.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:22:42
In practice, the [top 3 mining pools are all in China]( producing 63-65% of hashing power.  If SegWit can't lure miners away from minijng pools in China, it can't change the already centralized mining situation.
@_date: 2016-03-21 09:23:37
When Classic has between 0-74% of hashpower it makes no protocol changes.  A 51% attack wouldn't be any different in that range than it is now.

How does bitcoin make a round trip back to China?  
My understanding is that China bans it's banks from dealing with bitcoin.  Miners in China might be able to buy foreign currencies with bitcoin, but I'm curious how bitcoin would make a round trip back to China.

[PayPal charges about 2.9% and $0.30 per transaction]( which makes small transactions even more expensive than 2%-4%.  For example, a $2 purchase incurs $0.36 in fees, or 18%.  I assume credit cards are similar, based on all the signs you see about not allowing credit cards under $10 purchases.  So at least the incentive is there for merchants... although if they are forced to make customers wait to confirm transactions, customers won't stand for it.
@_date: 2016-03-21 02:57:47
My credit card.  Sure, it's not free for the other guy, but I don't see the fees on my end.  That's what bitcoin is competing against.  
The delays, as I see it, are more dangerous for adoption than for the specific level of fees.  When merchants can't get immediate confirmations, they take additional risk.  Satoshi's paper mentioned 0-conf as something he'd like to keep, and I think for small purchases it's the only way to do business without delays.

But isn't it legal for individual Chinese to own bitcoin?  
["While private parties can hold and trade bitcoins in China, regulation prohibits financial firms like banks from doing the same."](
@_date: 2016-03-21 09:05:58
Block  held 2097 transactions.  The model you mention of $7/transaction would equal $14,679 to obtain the block reward of $10,211 ($408.45 x 25 BTC) and any fees.  The fees come nowhere near thousands of dollars.  Either the mining pools are wrong / losing money, or $7/transaction is wrong.  
You're also modeling it incorrectly.  The smallest block, like my  example above, is 1 transaction.  The mining pool gets paid $10,211 for that 1 transaction, not $7.  And that's the flaw: the first transaction gets $10,211 (avoiding an empty block) and other transactions only net their respective fees.  The $7/transaction model ignores the block reward, despite it being far more significant.  
I acknowledge I'm not thinking of per transaction electricity costs.  But do I need to for the next 4 years?  The block reward is about to become $5,000 per block.  Transaction fees are a tiny percentage of that.  As long as the block reward is significant, it needs to be significant in modeling the rewards of bitcoin mining.  
I think Satoshi planned to ease us into transaction fees by lowering the block reward every 4 years.  Rather than try to artificially raise fees, let the decreasing block rewards lower the hash power naturally to a level that's stable given the fees and block reward.  Next chance to see this in action is only months away (when block reward  
goes from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC).
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:00:39
Agree that spending money to prioritize does not help small transactions.  If bitcoin is headed toward $0.30 in fees to confirm quickly, it loses the ability to compete on price against PayPal or credit cards.  I agree 0-conf is more prevalent and important than higher fees for faster transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:21:55
Search the entire article for "0-conf" and it only comes up in the following paragraph:  
"Erik is an influential figure in Bitcoin land (because he’s done fantastic work with Shapeshift.io) who unfortunately doesn’t (or didn’t) understand the full implications of Bitcoin’s design and his desire to rely on 0-conf transactions represents an incorrect and dangerous use of the system."

If you look at actual blocks, you do not see anything near the 400k limit.  Looking at the last 10 blocks (403711 - 403720) I count:  
1x block with 1 transaction (  
2x blocks under 400k (   
1x block at 445k (  
1x block at 977k (  
5x blocks 99% full / 1Mb ( -     
That averages over 700k, and closer to 800k if you ignore the block with 1 transaction.  Nowhere near 400k suggested by luke-jr.

Right now, where would you send a link requesting bitcoin?
While there is a layer of security, the idea is similar to publishing contact information for anyone with bitcoin.  Scammers will use that data to fool people, and request money.
Consider how often you see requests for money over email.  What happens if your email account also is your bitcoin wallet?  I understand that I'm oversimplifying, but I think others aren't considering the possibility because spam filtering is normally so successful.
@_date: 2016-03-24 16:36:54
Have you considered digging up the CEO's contact information and relaying your story?  Highlight what it means to them - that bitcoin to pay for hotels/flights is going to get all negative press if they have repeat stories like yours.  The CEO won't personally deal with it, but there's a chance he'll pass it to the relevant director/V.P., and I guarantee that's more effective than a cold call from you.  
Low chance of happening - so don't get your hopes up too much, but this can work.  
Good luck.

"... his desire to rely on 0-conf transactions ..."
That assumes no business use 0-conf transactions - that it's a problem limited to convincing Erik Voorhee.  When people buy coffee with BTC, they rely on 0-conf transactions.  Similarly for the  VPN provider, who confirms payment as soon as the transaction is available.  0-conf is widely used, and yet mostly ignored in your article.

There are limits to what China can transfer out in bitcoin.  25 bitcoins per 10 min equals 2.1 million bitcoins generated per year, or about 1.5 million bitcoins by miners in China.  At $400/bitcoin, that's $600 million/year compared to $1,000,000 million ($1 Trillion).  Bitcoin in China is insignificant compared to the outflows from China.

You're thinking more carefully than most posters and I appreciate that.  I stared at your explanation awhile before trying to work it out myself.  I created this timeline to help me sort through it:  
block 419328 = (208 * 2016), starts new 2016 block cycle  
block 420000 = BTC mining reward drops from 25 to 12.5  
block 421344 = (209 * 2016), starts new 2016 block cycle  
My calculations show 1344 blocks remain after "Halving" point is reached.  The assumption of 20 minute blocks (3/hr x 24/day = 72 blocks/day) gives me 18.7 days.  So if 20 minute blocks become normal, then difficulty will adjust 2.7 weeks after the miner's reward drops to 12.5 BTC.

But there's also a flip side - not to ignore an idea just because Satoshi said it.  I consider cheap, small transactions to be a niche advantage of bitcoin.  With bitcoin I might pay to read a single news article, maybe $0.05.  Credit card fees are too high to make that payment reasonable... but it's disturbing if bitcoin winds up also making that transaction unreasonable.  What I haven't done is go out and find an example of a news site accepting bitcoin for articles, so maybe it's my view rather than one used in the real world.

Can you provide more detail on why you expect $50M can buy 25% of the hashing majority?  
Here's my estimate: [F2Pool claims 243,000 TH]( the equivalent of ~52,000 Antminer S7 [($1500 on Amazon, with 4.7TH)](  Before you can buy $80 million in miners to match F2Pool, you'd have to corner the market on new bitcoin miners without driving up the price... but even that ignores data center and electricity costs.

Let's say you paid 0.02 BTC for 1 month of VPN service.  You paid $7, but at the time you paid for VPN those 0.02 BTC were valued at $8.  The IRS wants you to treat bitcoin like an asset, so you owe capital gains when you used bitcoin to purchase.  The $1 increase in price becomes capital gains, and you should report it and pay tax.  
There's a couple online services to help with it, or you can setup a spreadsheet.  The problem is that you need to understand how to split buying 0.1 bitcoin into two "lots" for matching with your later spending.  
Note until you sell bitcoin, you don't owe capital gains.  And while I'm not a tax advisor, it's generally a good idea to pick the most expensive bitcoin purchase and pair that with your spending.
@_date: 2016-01-30 06:51:52
I'm actually new to the discussion - it's someone else with the evil plan.  
My point being it's much more expensive than even $50M suggests.  One added point: If total bitcoin mining is 1000 PH, and you try to capture 25% by purchasing 250 PH, you gain not 25% of the market but 20% of the newly expanded market (which is now 1250 PH).

I think this opens a door for scammers.  Instead of spam email, you could see scammers trying to lure people into clicking away their bitcoin.  They could spam people with requests to pay, and some of that garbage would get clicked on, costing people bitcoin.  
Currently my bitcoin wallet is only a destination - scammers can't do anything but donate to it.  Email addresses are targets for virus and malware attacks.  So something similar could happen with this idea: scammers targeting people's bitcoin by requesting payment for a bogus service.  
I'm not suggesting abandoning the idea!  It's a very good idea with the customer in mind.  But I do suggest you think like a scammer, and how they'll operate, and make sure it's difficult for them.
