wow 95 minutes.
blockchain.info says the average is 8.57 minutes - I wonder what the sd looks like and how statistically significant this is.
Anyone know if there's an online bell curve for block solution times?

It took 4 hrs and 7 min for the transaction to make it into a block (a new record) ... so here's some karma for SegWit &lt;3 &lt;3

1. open an account on Canadian bitcoin exchange and link your bank account. send from bcw to your exchange wallet and then transfer to bank
2. Sell your bitcoin to someone for cash (e.g. localbitcoins), then deposit to your account
3. Spend bitcoin for online purchases (this is the best option for the community as a whole and for protecting your bitcoin investment) instead of via credit card/bank

if you want anonymity buy using cash (coins not traceable to you)
if you want ease, security, personal safety buy on an exchange

Bought a mining rig. Its already obsolete and doesnt make enough to cover the electricity costs.
Moved to cloud hashing.
