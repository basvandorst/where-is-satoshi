So when BCH forked, many people were advising to dump asap before the price drops. Being a newbie i followed this advice and dumped when it was about 200$. One month later or so it reached nearly 1000$. So: Short term i would hodl. Long term i'll sell.

Get a wallet which you control the private keys of.
Store your coins there.

Please continue panicking and sell me your coins dirtcheap. Thank you.

To me its simple as that: If you invest lets say 5000$ Dollars there is the chance to lose it all. SAD! If you decide not to invest and it goes to 100k someday thats far worse (to me). So for me, no-brainer.

Please just stop ... if you need advise of a fortune teller to tranquillize you should consider if your still only investing what you’re willing to lose.
