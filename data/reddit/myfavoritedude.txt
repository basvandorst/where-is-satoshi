Yes that is poor security habit and I would have suggested he send it to another address after I gave it to him.  But I get it it's only $100 and he didn't want to make it too difficult for the guy.

They can ban black rhino poaching and they can ban crypto and they just banned both.  Bannning doesn't mean eradicate from existence, you moron.

Why don't you go there and ignore the laws and get thrown in prison.

The question to me seems to be where are you going to store your passphrase/seed and how secure is that.  However I suppose less likely to get hacked if you have the coins on a hardware wallet than on an internet connected PC.

They aren't trying to stop them all.  They are just trying to stop 99% of them and they just succeeded.

And when that data is stolen, you can have someone showing up in your bedroom and a gun to your head, demanding you transfer your crypto to them right there.  It is even more dangerous than someone knowing you have assets in a bank.

They just did. So did China and India and many other countries.
But you are correct..you can't ban Bitcoin from exisiting.  What a huge victory for freedom and for you.

It is contained.  It is banned.  But you are correct that they can't erase the word, "Bitcoin" from everyone's memory.  Another victory for crypto and Bitcoin !

Yes just like they did and very little ivory poaching now, especially relative to if it was legal.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:33:09
Of course.  It's been that way for years and people are still in denial about it.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:49:39
Because they have already done this before with Bitfinex.  They pressured them into now allowing US customers.  Bitfinex is probably the biggest offender with manipulation and probably no coincidence that Phil Potter left a few day sago.

There is de facto premium charge to go first.  Any of the other boaters could have offered the same amount, but they didn't think of it or didn't want to spend the money.  OP made it happen and nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:31:09
Yes these dumb mfers don't get that you can ban IP addresses for Bitcoin nodes and shut the whole thing down.
These morons think that if one person is buying $10 of Bitcoin in a country where it's banned that Bitcoin has won. Yeah, great and the market price will continue to drop with most of humanity banned from buying it.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:12:12
That I better offer $110 if it's worth it to me. But that's a poor analogy to the boat situation without people waiting around.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:59:43
There's nothing wrong with that, necessarily.  It's like buying a front row ticket that is more expensive than one in the balcony.   
Of course the front row tickets were not offered to the other people, but nor was it offered to OP.  He took the initiative to pay extra for better service.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:28:48
Actually many thousands of dollars and multiply that by the other 100 countries that have banned or will ban crypto and there's no one left to buy so you can get your lambo.
Too bad, you will have to walk.

Great advice and in a year or two, he can get it out and it will very possibly be worth $10.

Rebellion is to not use KYC exchanges.  Of course there are less and less alternatives every day.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:46:23
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:23:30
Wow you are confused.  That isn't true of Bitfinex, Gdax, or Gemini.  You can fund your acct by transferring cryptocurrency in.  Also there are other exchanges, where you can trade anonymously.  Actually Bitfinex is one of those.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:00:41
You are dumb if you think that is illegal.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:31:49


No shit and the fact that you say that like it is some new discovery shows how many delusional morons there are around here.  It really is astounding.  Dumb little children.
