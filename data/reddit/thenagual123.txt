Thanks, I actually was reading about them last night . 
Is it normal for a coin transfer to take up to 40 hrs- they told me that it is due to the recent increase in coin value

Yea, I’m really pissed at them .as soon as I get my coin I’m done. If.
It seems like the responses they have sent me are auto -email. 
They don’t acknowledge my questions whatsoever . 
I’m kinda thinking I need to ditch their wallet as well . 
Is mycelium any good for a wallet ? 
I also have Coinbase.

I’m pretty angry at simplex, more at myself - I should have done more research , I’m now finding all kinds of reports of them holding coins for days on end and then even charging people after doing so.

I have a simplex payment id. 
No transaction number.

I called the bank , they told me the money is on limbo 
Basically .
They said that it hadn’t been verified by botcoin.com but had left the bank 
Do you know if it’s possible to stop the transaction?

I typed in my wallet address in blockchain and is says “0”  transactions .
