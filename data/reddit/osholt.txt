I think pretty much all universities in the UK have at least one bar.

This happened to me. I wasn't sure what to think. I logged into Mt Gox using my original password (unique to Mt Gox). Do I need to do anything else? I had nothing in my wallet.

For those interested I think the university is KCL. I'm going to go out on a limb and say OP is a compsci student there.

So you're saying they traded all the Bitcoins for Dogecoin? To the Moon!

As long as you don't have to submit your own self-assessment tax return it should be pretty straight forward as  no extra tax is due when you receive the money. Either convert your salary yourself on an exchange if you trust international bank transfers and the slightly shady exchanges or using Local Bitcoins, Bit Bargain etc. or get your employer to do this before you receive the salary.
From my understanding of HMRC's treatment of bitcoin appreciation no tax is due if you make gains on BTC against GBP as long as the Bitcoin you own wasn't bought as an investment and was bought instead as something to be spent in the short to medium term. I believe there is also a threshold before you are liable for capital gains tax anyway.
Imagine if you bought lots of holiday money for a couple of months time and then the value of that appreciated hugely; no tax is owed due to the original intent of purchase. 
If you do keep a large portion of your salary as savings in BTC I would recommend you talk to an account about the possible tax liabilities

I just keep an encrypted backup of irreplaceable stuff on the USB flash drive on my key chain.

Debit cards. You can get one. Children as young as 11 can have them. You just want the simplest bank account available that includes one. By law (at least in Europe), banks have to give you a basic bank account with some means of withdrawal (almost always a debit card) no matter what your financial situation as an individual is.
See  for the UK and in the United States here is a bank account I am sure you can open that gives you a debit card.

It very much would.
I do hope IBWT really gets going. I think a little bit of publicity (even just on and would go a long way to establishing a user base and raising awareness of the exchange. 
The first time I went on the relaunched ibwt it was baron which really put me off. there wasn't very much information up and no one really knew anything about it.
As for bank accounts, well hopefully the situation will improve. HMRC (and by extension the government) seem not to object to Bitcoin. If there's a large enough demand from the UK Bitcoin Industry (which is apparently a thing and advised HMRC) then hopefully at least one bank will decide the risk is worth taking. I wouldn't even mind if there was strict, PayPal-style anti money laundering stuff set up on the exchange if it meant faster payments could be used.

OKPAY is the reason I don't want to use it. I'd much rather have a direct bank deposit system than go through a shady third party who have changed their mind about Bitcoin at least 3 times in the last year.

I'm saying for security reasons you'd need to type in a pin (or some other method controlled by the purchaser). Otherwise your walking around with a bitcoin wallet waiting to be emptied by some stranger.
I know how Bluetooth 4 works.

In a well devised system, all this would need is a selectable list of nearby devices (with names), a confirmation number entered by the customer (like a pin code) which authorises the payment. You could add in more security like, on device confirmation but that's the minimum you would need.

You're right but I don't buy coins that often (due to lack of exchanges and places to spend them) so I just use Bitbargain for the most part.

How does this work? What if I turn my computer off? Won't the the other people's data become inaccessible?

I was under the impression that it was illegal to gamble online if you were American even if using Bitcoin bought in USD. Where that leaves mined Bitcoin I don't know. Have I got this wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:05:26
Fair enough. I'm still not at a point where I have enough faith in ibwt to actually put some coins in. Until UK banks stop killing off UK Bitcoin businesses I'm out (hence payments, I genuinely would rather have Bitbargain style purchasing mechanism than go through a third party). It also doesn't have the critical mass of users yet to give it the pull factors. Right now I still think Bitbargain is a safer bet.
That being said Bitbargain isn't a proper exchange.
In any case there needs to be a new BTC/GBP exchange which actually gets used sometime soon; whether that be ibwt or someone else I don't know.
