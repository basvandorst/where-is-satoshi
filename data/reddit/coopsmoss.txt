Makes me want to start mining

Jeez then don't do it.

Worth getting into altcoins and etherium?

Sorry about the guilt, they're just upset. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:18:43
Or just keep the keys and cash them yourself once they say they forget

I bough bitcoin because of reddit

People who are scared of it are just propagating negatively as much as they can. This is but a setback, and these people should be embracing it.

A politician with sense!
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:44:13
And that is my answer, I don't think there is much that can be done, it needs wider adoption. Slowly by surely

It is how people send you money, spend your coins on something.

Are they really as big picks as they are in the movie
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:30:32
People want to ban bitcoin because of the Silk Road, but they won't restrict guns because of murders
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:09:50
This is a touchy matter I suppose. 
Opinions are strong. But a good democracy gives everyone a chance to vote. And if they want to, it lets them vote to elect someone who wants to legalize murder, if the majority want murder to be legal, let it be.
Of course, I don't support murder, this is an extreme example.
But civil disobedience is important in bring about a positive change. Russia is a "democracy" (is little else, in name only) but it's got massive corruption and problems. And if the government could stop people who would vote against it from voting that would not be democracy. (Not that voting seems to matter much in Russia these days)
I admit these aren't the best examples, but I'm tired and on a bus.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:27:16
But can it be applied to an existing currency?
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:42:01
So destroy all the benefits of bitcoin. NICE IDEA!
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:47:43
That's terrible, and certainly not democratic. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:22:01
Okay, so what bank are you going to switch to? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:10:11
I can't imagine how regulation would have prevented this, wasn't the problem a security issue with the site?
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:46:11
And every online retailer that accepts them does the conversion from USD to set the BTC price, we could see it in terms of gold, but it will be a log time yet until we see it in terms of groceries, shoes and labour.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:56:57
Because they are going to keep it and cut their losses, the fucks

Why's idea was it to make all computer beige anyways!
I think it wasted because plastics where that colour.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:28:24
I spent my afternoon coding a little price index indicator for my computer, got really fry straighter when it never changed
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:14:45
Could you like to some info about the "investigation" please
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:16:17
Wait, you can't vote if you have a criminal record in the US?!

Most people don't trade in currency or even in stocks. People need to be paid in bit coin and stores need I accept t

It's all bullshit! First he discredits the graph, then uses it to make his residual is point!

BTC price is directly related to the tides and phases of the moon

Save up for a few year and live on the cheap for as long as you can.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:44:59
Which is why I feel we should stop calling it a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:07:41
I see someone named kraken deposited a zillion dollars into your account sir
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:47:43
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:30:32
It is
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:08:09
Agreed, I put $30 in five years ago and forgot about it but now it's been lots of fun
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:44:21
This is what worries me. No one will spend them because the value can double tomorrow and no vender will accept them because the value could halve tomorrow
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:35:28
Only if you use an exchange, you can just meet a guy in an alley and do a sale
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:37:41
I sold, though its gone up more since
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:54:05
I think we're reaching a peak and I'm expecting it to drop again by about 1000 soon
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:06:38
I sold at 5500 expecting a dip but it just kept climbing so I put it back in. I realized that if I really believe in it, then in the long run it'll work out
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:22:15
That's not true. They operate like any currency exchange, the price they offer is slightly worse than the competitive price, then they sell it for profit.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:04:07
I put in $30 a few years ago because I thought it would be fun to watch and it's worth $400 now. Put something in, if BC really does succeed and becomes mainstream the value is going to go up by 1000x easy.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:41:04
Knock yourself out then
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:02:07
If you believe in it then don't ever sell until everyone owns some
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:10:38
I put $30 in several years ago when it was at about $1000, I lost it on an old hard drive and I spent my day finding it and I've got it in an exchange now. I feel like I should sell, but I'm pretty greedy.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:07:32
How to I claim my BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:08:46
Looks even better in Canadian dollars
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:11:39
Don't give up on that, send me the files and I'll see what I can do...
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:58:22
Probably not worth the electricity at this point
