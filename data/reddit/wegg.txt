If they were to wrest control of the money supply from their central bank and instill their own. . . the next election cycle this new bank would be taken over by whomever is the most well funded.  And it won't be them.  Bitcoin or Comodity backed currencies would remove the power all together.  They wouldn't be able to just print money to go to schools and hospitals and soccor fields like this man is promoting. . . but no one else would be able to print money to wage war, bail out their rich "too big to fail" friends etc.

Step back and look at the system we have right now.  With the Federal Reserve having the ability to print money whenever it feels it needs to in meetings closed to the public.  They literally bail out foreign banks with money they print out of thin air.  With that in mind, I find it ridiculous that something that is mathematically beautiful as bitcoin be "regulated" by people who deluded the vast majority of people into thinking fiat money is somehow not malicious, fraudulent etc.

Whuhu!?!  How could this POSSIBLY happen?  Government regulation is so awesome!  If we didn't have it we would all be eating horse meat and dying left and right from un-regulated drugs and killing ourselves off in un-safe cars etc etc. . . (sarcasm)

How many banks have been robbed?  Or better yet. . . how many actual real world wallets have been stolen in that time?  I know I had my physical wallet stolen from me in 2011 while vacationing in Australia.  Never got it back.  I have yet to lose a single bitcoin from when I first purchased them for $0.60 each way way back.  Yes this is a "good ole, it didn't happen to me so I'm not going to worry about it" but I am in no way a computer genius or security nut.  Regulation almost always has unforeseen consequences.  I don't think we will ever see the full revolution that is Bitcoin come into fruition if we use our puny minds to "Regulate" it at it's earliest stage.

I'm seeing 10.61 on my little ticker thing here.  Wow.  I remember when it was 0.61.  Sure hope this isn't a bubble.

I'd be down with that if there were some clarification on how I would go about returning the product if it was DOA.

Can you please resell your magazine through the barns and noble nook book store?

I have been trying for well over a year to understand how I can recover my lost coins.  I have had no replies to my e-mails or private message requests through the bitcoin forums.  It is very frustrating.  :-(
