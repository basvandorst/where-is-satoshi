I think at week two, or definitely three.. I would be on an airplane to san francisco and visit their offices directly, and I am on the east coast.   plus it would be nice to visit San Fran.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:39:00

trading volume as in whole coins?
Maybe cause when something is $400 people can buy more coins then when it's at $18,000?

Things not looking good this morning.  I expect 10 texts today.

This is more about bitcoin not being a traditional investment product. Most people don’t “get” crypto, and don’t trust the product.  Every other investment we have she never questions.

Exactly.  The misses is a wonderful but naive woman.  Naiveness is mostly a charming quality in her but sometimes it’s frustrating. Ha.  
A few years ago our state was offering a state tax rebate program geared towards helping lower income families.   We are not lower income.   Basic middle class.  One of the few. 
So my wife’s friend tells her “don’t you get the rebate?  We just got our check”.  Then my wife comes to me, 100% convinced that we should get the check and that I Was doing something wrong “well Susie says...”
And I’m saying,... how the hell you take Susie’s advice over mine?  She’s a customer service worker with no financial experience. 
Fast forward a few weeks later and Susie and husband are over. And the rebate comes up.  Quickly starts turning into a minor onslaught against me for not getting the rebate. 
I begrudgingly blurt out:  We make _____ combined. We don’t qualify as low income 
Everyone stops talking for a few seconds, partly in shock. The husband finally says “Jesus christ, yeah you don’t get any breaks or rebates   where ya putting all your money?”
Bitcoin apparently. Ha
I love her to death, but... ha!
But I digress.

This should be a wall plaque.

Its not worth giving up half my stuff. Plus she lets me do naked stuff with her.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:53:01
Been working on that.   Criteria is “instagram model with at least 5 million followers”.  Means looks and money.  Not having much success!

Yes i was hodling through the wifecoin fork, so now I have my original wife investment in the 40s and a new wifecash at 22.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:27
Obviously mine... which is why I share all this info with my wife and all of Reddit. Ha 
My fancier named version of a throwaway account.

transaction costs keep it from being a daily used "currency".  People arent going to pay 15% to buy something.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:20
Haha I forgot about that scene!  Perfect fit for crypto. 
Impressive that at 17 you have a decent enough savings for Mom and dad to be concerned about.   At 17 I was dumping all my money into Taco Bell and arcade games.

We did a spit handshake, and she’s good now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:32:17
Holding for 2 years now.  Look it up. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:25:42
I had no idea I had bitcoin cash coming to me from the fork until I read someone else’s comment telling someone “don’t forget you have bitcoin cash”.  And I thought... hmmm I have HODLing for 2 years so I... oh wow look at that,.. like money from heaven. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:03:47
Oh a stupid move on my part.  Got tired hearing it.  I went with the “we don’t qualify” and got the “well how do you know just fill it out.”
I just wanted to quickly put and end to it. Ha

Told her if she picked up a weekend night shift at the club she’d have nothing to worry about.  Bigger tips on the weekends, not to mention bachelor parties.

Close coworkers and friends know... because I have a small amount that I bought really cheap as an experiment (not enough of course) and its grown significantly, but I am far from a retiring millionaire, say its under 100k right now.   So its an interesting story to tell people "Yea I put a couple hundred in X years ago, and now its worth____"
Hoping it gets to a level that I can sell one at a price to pay off my house and let the remainder ride to a million each, at which point everyone will know "Holy shit do you still have that bitcoin?". ha,
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:49
That just may work!

my wife had a conversation with her brother in law, who has no money to invest, has no stocks or bitcoin..and proceeded to tell her that bitcoin is a farce.
So now I ahve to listen to my wife tell me that its a bad investment, when her source of info is a BIL who read a couple articles. (I've seen 50x growth in a small initial amount)
It initially drove me nuts, now I just ignore her.   
A good marriage is based on strong foundation of communication. ha

So is this the one dip?  Or was it when people announced it last week?  Or the week before? How about that time right before that?   :-)
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:44:12
Who says I don’t have other investments, funds and ETFs?   Are people assuming I paid $19,000?   2 years ago I put what was the equivalent amount of a new 4K tv into bitcoin (before the fork).  $1200.  My three coins have peaked at 60k.   Even with the drop, my bitcoin cash is worth $10k.... so I am still looking at a 50x increase in 2 years 
My only regret is I didn’t buy more!
