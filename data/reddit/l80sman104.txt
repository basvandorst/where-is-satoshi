You used bitcoin.

IMO it would tarnish the ownerless vibe of bitcoin. Though I'm knowledgeable enough at this point to know it is now completely out of his control. Goodluck with everyone else though. I can see the media spin now, "meet the new king of the world, a psychotic cryptography master who is going to destroy every economy in the world! Do you trust him more than america? Really??! We also found out he touched someone inappropriately when he was 22! He's the greatest terror threat this world has ever faced! He's osama bin laden times a thousand!"

I love that it's called a ATM instead of a vending machine.

If that were true, then the word atm would be fitting I suppose. I want a global tuna account now.

You can't have individual freedom and the redistribution of wealth because you sacrifice freedom of the rich to extort the wealth from the rich. The rich may opt to give some wealth voluntarily but certainly not to the extent that would be required by communism.

If bitcoin were fully adopted, it would not help this guys agenda, redistribution of wealth is harder to achieve when it's harder to track down and control. This is a good thing, but not for communists which ultimately require more onerous taxes and controls on wealth.

Monopolies exist because artificial barriers to entry exist that prevent smaller entrants. And government enforced corporate entities.

Who manufactured that ATM? I have not seen anything like it.

I bought at the $6300 all time high, every price was once the all time high.
