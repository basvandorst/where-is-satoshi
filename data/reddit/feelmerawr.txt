funny you mention this because work out massively in my favor. my rate $2k usd for three hour escort session.
for btc i round up at next tenth. so here with $10k usd so close.....$2k usd = 0.20051 btc so i round up.....0.3 btc = $2992 usd for three hour session. almost $1k usd extra for my favor!
and client won't even blink.....because most client paying bitcoin bought their bitcoin during dip. so my 0.3 btc session only "cost" them $1.5k! lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:05:46

do you have wallet address or wallet id? two different things. wallet address look like:
 * 16qBg5YrPKykYZMaBk9pqH1Meh4ta5AS2H (chose random recent one from blockchain.info).
wallet id have dashes. see sample wallet id at:
 * 
difference is wallet address send transaction to/from. wallet id used for login/backup/restore.
if 12 random words and wallet id with dashes might try login at blockchain.info:
 * 
13 words might be electrum wallet.
 *
