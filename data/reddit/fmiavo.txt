Interesting but if possible you need to integrate a trading feature and also if you can integrate bitstamp and btc-e as well this would be the king android crypto apps, I would offer to help but I'm no Dev don't know anything about coding really accept small tid bits I pick up here and there but I hope this app does well and like I said If you can integrate trading and bitstamp/btc-e it would really shine!

Bitcoin is often described as “virtual gold” — as well as everything from a “bubble” to a “Ponzi scheme” to “a haven for individuals to buy black market items.”

“With the adoption of cryptocurrencies increasing every day, their viability is virtually assured. History shows that paper currency, backed by nothing of value, will ultimately fail. It’s only a matter of time until no one will be accepting the dollar. By trading exclusively in cryptocurrencies, we’ll still be in business when that time comes.”

The market sets the price not the early adopters.  If you ask me I see the mining difficulty as a way to make the coin scarce and therefore more valuable.  The price has incentive to rise but this is not necessarily due to mining difficulty.   As opposed to fiat, where the value is diminished due to high supply and low demand and also no central entity controlling the currency.. 
 I've personally never heard of a Ponzi scheme that brings new revolutionary technology to the table, have you?

This could get really big.  Are there copies of your data distributed inside the network similar to say, HDFS?  Would it be possible to interact with the network using bash? 
 
I have some servers, say I would put a server up with 1 TB, can you give an idea (very rough estimate) how much you would earn per month for opening it up? 0.0001 BTC? 0.01 BTC? 1 BTC?

Why use Bitcoin in that case? Bitcoin isnt ment for people to see something online for $10 go to coinbase and buy $10 worth of Bitcoin.

I second giving them a nice paper wallet with cool design. That way they can hold on to the private key safely, and if they want to spend it they will have to learn more about Bitcoin and how to import the private key.
Here's some good sites:

Isn't one major selling point of bitcoin is that it is impossible to counterfeit a bitcoin and that you are protected from a double spend attack? (hint: yes).
Wouldn't using bank/bitcoin notes in this regard open you up to the above possibilities? (hint: also yes).

It's funny , but misleading as Bitcoin has the same transaction times of the rest. It would be more accurate if it referenced "confirmation times" but that still ignores confirmations happening offchain as well.

Its really and truly millions as Xapo is accepted at any Visa /Mastercard outlet
How many payment card merchants are in the US?
This is a rather complex question to produce a satisfying answer. The data is not regularly published by the largest Payment Card Companies.  Visa for example claims about 29 Million outlets and MasterCard claims 16 Million outlets.  This data is worldwide data and does not break out the US component. In addition the dataset is always a moving target.
Why Don't More Small Businesses Accept Credit Cards
The argument I hear from most merchants is that it is too expensive to accept credit cards. But I have been in stores, and you probably have as well, that have a sign on the counter that says X amount will be added to all credit card transactions. Or, that there is a minimum purchase requirement. I’m not sure if that is a legitimate way to process the transaction, but I see it often enough. Customers seem to understand that the cost of processing plastic is greater than cash and most seem willing to accept this cost from smaller merchants.
The benefits of accepting credit and debit cards far outweigh the cost. The various studies show that when people are given more payment options (beyond cash); they are more likely to make impulse purchases, join loyalty programs, and spend more per purchase – and that can only help your business to grow.
But if their concern is the fee from traditional cards.... bitpay has the answer... zero fees forever. 
 
One of bitcoin’s leading merchant processors, BitPay, has introduced a new pricing plan that makes its basic level of service free and unlimited.

I disagree.  I think Paypal HATES Bitcoin.  I think they are only starting to accept it because as the old saying goes "if you can't beat em, join em."  A bunch of smart business men got into a room, and thought..."what would happen if people start to adopt Bitcoin, and realize that they can send money for goods without using our service and paying a 3% fee?"  
Paypal smartly decided to hedge their bets.  If they didn't adopt Bitcoin, and Bitcoin really took off...especially amongst younger people, more likely to sell things online, Paypal could crumble and disappear in a very short amount of time.
They did a smart thing by accepting Bitcoin.
