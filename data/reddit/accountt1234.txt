You're divesting oppressive regimes. However, in the process you're empowering a small number of rich libertarians who own the majority of Bitcoin, many of whom have committed dubious ethical actions. Example, would you trust the guy who ran away with the Sheep Marketplace funds with owning a fortune worth billions of dollars?
Bitcoin can erode government power, but we have to wonder whether it won't be replaced by something worse.

Putting this in some perspective:
[One kilogram of gold costs 187 GJ of energy.](
[That's 6.70 tons of CO2.](
[The value of one Kg of gold is 42.000 dollar.](
One tons of CO2 is 2000 pounds, so 6.7 tons is 13400 pounds.
312 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air per coin is what the article deals with.
Dividing 42.000 dollar by 84, to arrive at the value of a Bitcoin means we deal with 13400 pounds / 84 is 159 pounds of CO2 if you used Gold instead of Bitcoin.
The difference being that those 159 pounds are produced every year on gold. Most Bitcoin were produced without spending that much energy to produce them, simply growing in value later on when people realized the potential of Bitcoin.
Thus it's not a big issue so far, and the coming block reward halving will reduce CO2 emissions even further.

@_date: 2014-01-22 14:23:58


It is.
If you're mining an obscure coin like Quark and have 2 million computers to mine with, you're raising difficulty, because you'll control 99% of the network.
Let's say you use 2000 computers, which we will say is enough to control 50% of the hashrate.
Using ten times as many computers, 20.000, would give you 99% of the hashrate, in other words, only twice as many coins, for ten times as much hashing power you're wasting.
Thus, large botnets probably won't bother mining altcoins like Quark or Securecoin, because there's simply no benefit to it for them.
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:47:53


There's a difference.
If you believe that Bitcoin is getting 51'd, you have run to and ask people with mining hardware to please start mining somewhere else. But what if those people can't start mining somewhere else, or what if the guy 51ing the network is a guy using people's pre-orders?
If you believe that Litecoin is getting 51'd, you start mining yourself. You won't make a profit, but you at least have some control over the process.

It's not wasting money to the attacker, because you're still receiving payment from the pool operator for the work he sees you doing.
It starts being lost income to the attacker if the attacker continues his attack after the pool operator can no longer pay out a fair amount for the work done by the miners and reduces the amount they're paid per share of work.

No, it's not a 51% attack, please read carefully. This is not a direct attack on Bitcoin, it's an indirect attack on the network accomplished by attacking a competing pool.

I had the same problem. My programmer had put a secondary password on a blockchain wallet. My programmer fucked up and I haven't talked to him since, but I still had 0.05 BTC stuck in that wallet, locked with a secondary password I didn't know.
I thought I had lost the money.
What I did was look at my backups in my email from blockchain, and I found my backup. The backup didn't have the secondary password activated yet, so I got the money back.
If you look in your mailbox, you might find a backup too that blockchain sent you.

Sorry, I have no source. The bug was painfully obvious to anyone who used their site during that time and could only happen due to extremely poor programming. You could easily set your own stop loss, canceling out their stop loss and thus allowing you to essentially bet with someone else's money, taking the profit if you win, passing the loss on to btc.sx if you lost. A child could do this. They closed for a while when they realized everyone was fucking them over. And yes, their previous trade partner was Mt Gox so they lost a lot of money there anyway.

-Bitcoin is being dilluted by altcoins.
And yet, Bitcoin is working all the same.

The problem is SHA-256 proof of work.
If you use a cryptocurrency with 6-Factor or some other CPU-intensive form of mining, people can simply mine with their CPU, thus allowing them to move to different pools. The CEX.io scenario we see now would not happen. 
Even Litecoin still allows people to mine with their own equipment in an emergency scenario. If some group were to try to attack Litecoin, average Joe could start up his computer and start mining himself.

I posted this in the other thread and I'd love to have someone check my math:
Putting this in some perspective:
[One kilogram of gold costs 187 GJ of energy.](
[That's 6.70 tons of CO2.](
[The value of one Kg of gold is 42.000 dollar.](
One tons of CO2 is 2000 pounds, so 6.7 tons is 13400 pounds.
312 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air per coin is what the article deals with.
Dividing 42.000 dollar by 84, to arrive at the value of a Bitcoin means we deal with 13400 pounds / 84 is 159 pounds of CO2 if you used Gold instead of Bitcoin.
The difference being that those 159 pounds are produced every year on gold. Most Bitcoin were produced without spending that much energy to produce them, simply growing in value later on when people realized the potential of Bitcoin.
Thus it's not a big issue so far, and the coming block reward halving will reduce CO2 emissions even further.

First of all, Zionism is a historical movement that successfully accomplished its goal of establishing a Jewish state. To criticize Zionism makes about as much sense as criticizing Italian Risorgimento, Norwegian nationalism, Indian independence or any other historical nationalist movement. 
Second, Israel has a multitude of different ethnic groups living in the same nation, including Armenians, Druze, Arabs, Ethiopian Jews, Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Russians, as well as a few thousand Black Hebrews from the United States. 
If you're worried about racism, you might wish to look instead at the millions of Sephardic Jews who were forcibly expelled from Arab countries after the foundation of Israel, or alternatively at the hundreds of thousands of descendants of Palestinians who are not given citizenship of the countries they are born in.

No, because anytime they try to change the rules the rest of the nodes in the network would not accept their changes to the protocol. If they try to mine a block with a 50 Bitcoin block reward or something along those lines, all other nodes would see it and reject the block.
What they CAN do is mine blocks without anyone's transactions, meaning that your transactions will not be confirmed thus ensuring that you can't effectively transmit your Bitcoin. They can also attempt a double spend attack.
This would cause a massive price crash, which they could benefit from by short selling Bitcoin before starting their attack.

TL;DR: Bad stuff, guard your poopers.
Longer version:
Bitcoin depends on consensus, the entire network has to accept the same blocks. When people disagree over whether a block is valid or not, a fork occurs. A fork causes panic, allows a double spending attack and tends to lead to price drops. The blocksize limit is 1 MB, and the reason it isn't raised is because there exists no consensus over how to proceed from here.
Roughly there are two groups of people:
These people want to keep the blocksize limit at 1 MB, because raising the blocksize limit will eventually only allow people with very good hardware to maintain a full node. They want to limit the number of transactions on the blockchain, and keep spam like Satoshidice-clone transactions off the blockchain, by allowing a rise of the transaction fee through free competition. When you have to pay 0.001 BTC for a transaction to have your transaction included, you will have an incentive to avoid spamming the blockchain.
These people want to allow Bitcoin to grow as much as possible and as fast as possible. They tend to have a profit motive, as a rise in transactions will ensure a rise in value. To them the blocksize limit only exists as a relic of the past to protect the blockchain against anyone intentionally bloating the blockchain in size in its initial phase. They want to raise the blocksize limit to allow Bitcoin to grow. They will probably "win" in the long run, as the Bitcoin developers will raise the blocksize limit, but they have an interest in delaying a rise in the blocksize limit, because when the blocksize limit is raised a permanent hardfork will occur, as the Pro-decentralization people will simply refuse to upgrade.
If the developers wait with raising the limit until we reach the blocksize limit, miners will not be able to include all transactions they see, effectively passing them on to next blocks. This is not a problem, if those blocks are not very full themselves. If however those blocks are very full as well, transactions will take hours to be included in a block, thus slowing down the network and essentially forcing the developers to raise the limit.

[2000 dollar are enough treat 100,000 people against intestinal parasites.](
Intestinal parasites are widespread, in many countries more than half the children suffer from intestinal parasites.
By extension, if we had 1 million dollar, we could buy enough medicine to treat 50 million children. A bottle of anti-parasite medicine really just costs 2 cents to produce.
Just $1 could save 100 to 300 pounds of food in the bellies of children. The cost-benefit ratio of such a project is **MASSIVE**.

It ultimately doesn't matter. Bitcoin is a peer to peer digital ledger. It's a method of sharing information. Information has proved difficult to remove from the Internet or people's minds. The harder information is fought against or the more publicity it receives, the more it grows.
Volatility will only make Bitcoin grow more, as it gives people who heard of it before but didn't have enough money at the time to step in the opportunity to step in later. Thus Bitcoin is anti-fragile. I'm growing mushrooms at home, and Bitcoin reminds me of growing young mushrooms. They grow much faster after you have shaken the jar around a bit.

I won't argue that regulators need to shut things down. I will argue however that you now discover why governments sometimes bail out banks. Mt. Gox poses a systemic risk to the entire Bitcoin economy. A lot of people are trading with companies that have funds stuck at Mt Gox. If Gox doesn't have their Bitcoin, those companies collapse, leaving those people without their Bitcoin. In addition, the price on Bitstamp falls hard, because of the situation over at Gox. Thus, even though you don't deal with someone unreliable, the fact that you're dealing with someone who deals with someone unreliable is enough to affect you.

That's overly harsh. I don't own Litecoin (sadly), but Litecoin has clear advantages over Bitcoin. Faster block confirmation time, different proof of work allowing mining to stay decentralized.

I had first heard about it in 2011 back when I was still a naive college student who thought college was the path to financial independence. I ignored it because I figured money would be no concern to me.
In February of this year someone on posted about Bitcoin breaking through the 30 dollar barrier. That's the first time i realized that the price of Bitcoin was very volatile and Bitcoin was scarce. In 2011 I knew it was a digital currency but nobody had told me anything about it rising in value based on demand and I didn't look into it any closer.
In hindsight the thing I regret most is going to college, because rather than teaching me the value of money, college and the whole culture that accompanies it teaches you the opposite, that money has no scarcity (since you're told to simply borrow it and pay it back when you get a great job, as if it's no big deal). Had I been working back in 2011, rather than going to college, I probably would have bought Bitcoin back then, rather than in March.

However, I don't agree that Nakowa only won 2500 Bitcoin. He has won more than that, somehow taking away the profit that should have belonged to the investors.
If we assume that nakowa is 75% of the money wagered on the site, that leaves 1 million wagered on the site without nakowa, with an expected profit of 10.000 bitcoin.
Instead we're at -2.500.
Thus we would be looking at a profit of 12.500 Bitcoin for nakowa, versus an expected loss of 30.000 for nakowa. [That's in line with this graph of nakowa.](
12.500 / 200 = 62.5 times winning.
Let's say nakowa won 62 more often than he lost, at 49.5% odds. We take 20.000 times, so nakowa won 10.031 times.
[We're now looking at a probability of 0.0105, or 1%, which is quite worrisome.](
What if nakowa bet 100 bitcoin per bet, instead of 200? [He would need to win 124 times more often than he lost, and we would end up with a p of 0.0044.](

Because there are two possible outcomes from such a situation:
The first and most likely possible outcome is that people lose faith in the currency. Imagine if 25% of gold is owned by one person. You'd rather see gold become worthless under such circumstances, and in the case of Bitcoin, it has no inherent possible use, and hence the incentive is to step over to a different currency.
The second, and less likely, but more horrific outcome, is that Bitcoin does end up working out, and the world's wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a small group of anonymous individuals.

That's different. The Rockefeller family lost their power because Standard Oil was broken up and their wealth was taxed.  The United States had a tax bracket for people with an income above 5 million, that affected only one person, namely, John D. Rockefeller.

The rich can easily force you to sell your land to them, because they have scale advantages in agriculture due to mechanization.
If the rich can sell their crops at 50% of your break-even price to other people, you can't survive on your farm.
You also have to remember that the rich, in the absence of government, can accumulate enough power to the point where they do not have to oblige by any ethical standards whatsoever. They could simply hire goons to force you off your land. Big corporations often do this in third world countries.

It's strange, I fully agree with your argument, and the conclusions you draw, however, it's the premise I disagree with.
Your premise is the idea that we need a higher standard of living. I see no reason to believe this. Instead we need to learn how to be content with less. What has progress meant so far? That children spend their days inside playing video-games instead of playing outside in the forest. As a result they grow fat, get acne, weak bones, and reduced physical strength.
Do we really need access to the Internet in the train? Is it really necessary for us to be available for contact at any moment? What good did any of this do to our culture? Does everyone really need to go to college? What did all this progress of the past 60 years deliver us? Suicide rates are higher today, and self-injury has turned into an epidemic.
We need to get rid of this addiction to growth, and make do with less. Saving, modesty and restraint should be seen as a virtue, rather than excessive conspicuous consumption. When the entire world steps over to a deflationary currency (Bitcoin), we will finally have the ability to end this insanity.

Bubbles are bad, as it's not banks that get ass-raped, but regular joes. I have friends who bought in during the dip in November, around 600 dollar I think and I was already warning them back then.

The biggest Chinese exchange has 0% fees in an effort to kill its competitors. In other words, you can trade back and forth as much as you want, and thus anyone can inflate the volume there. 
The other Chinese exchanges are known to provide unreliable figures. It's the empty restaurant effect. Nobody wants to visit an exchange that has no volume, so you fake your volume figures. Chinese Bitcoin volume wasn't even extraordinarily high the last few days, it mostly seemed high because volume on Bitstamp and Gox was so low.
So why did the price go up then? Because people thought the Chinese have entered the market, for which there is no good evidence.

No. It's better if he dumps them now, so that we can get it over with. It crashes the price, allowing people who are interested to step in now.
I don't mean he should dump them all in one day. He would be stupid to do that as the price would crash enormously and he would get pennies for his work. He owns about 20% of all Bitcoin in circulations right now. He should dump them onto the market over a period of a few months.
The fact that Bitcoin could experience a sudden crash if Satoshi released his Bitcoin onto the market is holding people back from buying Bitcoin. It held me back for a long time. I think that in the long term, a cryptocurrency with a more equal distribution of wealth would grow in popularity at the cost of a cryptocurrency with a less equal distribution of wealth.

No, because a rise in the price of Bitcoin simply increases the amount of money that a 51% attacker earns from his attack.
The only way for a 51% attack to be expensive, is for difficulty to be so high that miners are running at a loss, and miners who are running at a loss will eventually stop mining, thus lowering the difficulty again, and reducing the cost of a 51% attack again.
And as the price and use of Bitcoin rises, the amount of money to be gained from engaging in a 51% attack against Bitcoin increases for people whose business is threatened by Bitcoin (Paypal, anyone?).

This is why I call it a black swan. Peer to peer cryptocurrency has the potential to disrupt the global financial system by giving people an easy method to do day to day business with a non-inflationary currency, something that never existed before. It has a number of characteristics that make it inherently superior to conventional currencies.
Until now, people were forced to do business in central bank issued currency, because no viable alternative that could not be shut down existed.
The invention of peer to peer cryptocurrency has made the monopoly of central banks to issue currency unenforceable. Nobody ever stands still to recognize the significance of this.

In all fairness, bitcoin won't take off until women start using it. [A currency is only useful when it's actually spent, and women are responsible for 80% of money spent.](
Throwing bitcoin at women who take their clothes off on the internet seems a bit dehumanizing to me (even though "sex positive" feminists are all in favor of it, because it gives the strippers the impression that men are willing to pay to see their body, thus giving them a feeling of power).
A better idea to get women involved to me seems to use Bitcoin as a cheaper method of currency exchange, for people who go abroad, because women seem more likely to me to start using bitcoin out of pragmatic purposes, rather than ideological purposes. 
I wasted a lot of money converting euros to krones in Norway, and then converting the krones I had left back to Euro, still being left with 4 euro worth of krones that I had to spend on something at the airport, because they're only allowed to give me paper money for my krones. Bitcoin could solve this problem, by acting as an intermediary.

Really, so you'd rather have an anonymous individual control the issuance of currency, rather than a central government? How do you benefit from that?


Hoarding leads to accumulation of wealth in the hands of a small group of people. Eventually the masses of people would realize that the Bitcoin system serves a tiny elite of early miners and developers, and shift to a different money system. Hence the system collapses.
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:47:17


Here are a few reasons:
The ability to receive relatively anonymous coins, without having to meet someone in person or use your bank account.
The reputation associated with spending money to protect the network against a 51% attack.
The ability to gain access to Bitcoin in countries where government may make trading in Bitcoin illegal.
Protection against the risk of receiving Bitcoin that originate out of laundered money.
There will always be a number of people for whom Bitcoin originating out of mining are somewhat more valuable than Bitcoin that were bought. Keeping Bitcoin mining a costly affair is what protects us against a 51% attack.

The problem is, the process of adaptation occurs asymmetrically. Being the first to get a Facebook account doesn't really help you in life. Being the first to get Bitcoin however changes your life, and being part of the last 90% or so of people to get Bitcoin means that you're losing a significant amount money. 
Wealth is being redistributed from the mass of people to a small group of nerdy white males. The fact that I buy Bitcoin now means that I essentially steal money from people who will buy Bitcoin 4 years from now.
What is going to happen I think is that the early adapters and people suspected of inventing Bitcoin are in big trouble, and will likely have to change their whole identity. There will be a massive number of people who will absolutely hate their guts, not to mention what governments will do.

I think you're onto something with that statement.
It's bigger than just government however. Most people need regularity and order in their life. They're deeply afraid of uncertainty.
It's caused by our modern culture, which causes low self-confidence because we're always dependent on other people. When you have low self-confidence you want someone else (government, your boss, your college professor) to provide you with stability.
Low self-confidence also makes you afraid of looking stupid. I know for a personal fact that when I bought Bitcoin, it wasn't even losing the money that I feared. I was more afraid of feeling stupid and looking stupid to people around me if it crashes.

If what you are saying is true, it's even MORE unlikely for the site to have lost 40.000 bitcoin!
I did a conservative estimate. The smaller nakowa's bets are, the smaller the distribution of probabilities becomes, and the less likely Nakowa's outcome actually becomes!
Look at it this way: Imagine you throw one 20-sided dice and two ten-sided dices. Which of the two is more likely to get a total score of 20?
The prior has a chance of 5%. The latter has a chance of only 1%. And when we're dealing with a 4-sided dice that's thrown five times, we have a chance of  0.25 ^ 5 = 0.1% of hitting twenty.

@_date: 2013-05-22 17:06:26


I don't think so, because the APR depends on the underlying price fluctuation of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin itself is very high-risk. If the value of Bitcoin suddenly drops, the mining companies start losing money as well.

Expiration at 4 weeks from now seems good.
Nothing big, one or two shares max. If you want to sell more, I'm sure others on Bitfunder will happily step in as well, because nobody generally has the funds available to sell put options to us.

In the Bitcointalk thread, investors who stepped in during July and never divested report having losses of 25%.
How does a gambling site with a 1% edge end up costing its long-term investors 25% of their money? I don't believe that. Either those investors are lying, or people are being scammed. The only way this is possible is if some people somehow know when they have to invest their money into the site.
My hypothesis is that someone (it could be a group) gambles against Just-dice who knows the server seed, and makes a lot of money. He then goes on to invest most of that money into the investment pool, and purposefully loses against the site then, so that the site looks fair and the scam can't be detected using statistical methods, even though investors are losing their money.
It's possible that someone has access to your server seed without your knowledge. It's also possible that you are a very smart man.

Those commodities differ in that they don't allow extraordinary concentration of wealth.
If someone owned 25% of gold on the planet, we could expect this person to be murdered or extorted, or the gold to be stolen, as gold has to be physically stored somewhere.
With Bitcoin, someone is theoretically sitting on 25% of the world's wealth, and nothing can be done about it, as nobody even knows who this person is. 
Are we stepping into our own enslavement, will something force Mr. 25% to slowly let go of his wealth,  or are Bitcoins simply doomed to fail?

The NSA doesn't have the responsibility to help the Federal Government, but to help the American people.
If the creation of cryptocurrency is inevitable, the American government would be wise to promote its use among its own people first, instead of waiting for the Chinese to begin using cryptocurrency and the concept spreading form China to the US, as opposed to the other way around.
Any government that's anti-cryptocurrency condemns its people to a life of poverty.

The difference is that the Federal Reserve, the IMF, and the ECB, as autocratic as they might be, at least have some degree of accountability. We can debate how well these institutions function, but at least these are institutions that are controlled by technocratic economists and politicians, and are meant to help stabilize and develop global economies. Furthermore, we at least know the name of these institutions, and the people responsible for overseeing them.
With Bitcoin, if one unknown person owns 25% of the coins, we're all in trouble. There's no accountability whatsoever, and there's a potentially enormous amount of power vested in one unidentified person. How is that an improvement?

Those are all very insightful points, thanks.
Proof of work has always seemed very arbitrary to me.
The problem with proof of stake would be that it would lead to centralization of wealth, but this is avoided I think by the fact that Bitcoin reduces in value when you own a large amount of it as a large stack of Bitcoin is very illiquid, thus increasing the incentive for those who own a large number of Bitcoin to sell them onto the market.

Well, an algorithm controls the *creation* of Bitcoin. There's a subtle difference here. Issuance is defined as "the act of providing an item for general use or for official purposes".
If a few people own most of the coins in existence and the actual coins part of the money supply is small in comparison, we can argue that these people control the *issuance* of Bitcoin. This would explain why the price is so volatile, as the price crashes whenever they choose to exchange a large amount of their Bitcoin for dollars.

Yeah, I've thought about it as well. My suggestion is that there will always be an incentive to mine Bitcoin, beyond just the fees, and people will be willing to lose money while mining Bitcoin for the following reasons: 
-You get clean coins, with little to none previous transaction history.
-You get to include a personal message in the blockchain, which will be used in practice as a form of advertisement and a symbol of authority within the financial system.
-Getting Bitcoin through mining may be the easiest option in countries where Bitcoin will be banned.

I think this is unlikely for a few reasons. It's either all or nothing I think, and I'm leaning towards all.
-Bitcoin allows you to avoid taxes. This is going to be its biggest purpose. People can avoid the inheritance tax, avoid the sales taxes, avoid income taxes. Why would you want to store your wealth in dollars on your bank? As tax havens such as Switzerland are increasingly dismantled, tax dodgers will flee to Bitcoin.
-As more people dodge taxes successfully through use of Bitcoin, there will be fewer rich people to pay taxes. Hence, existing rich people will suffer even more oppressive taxes, in an attempt to pay for government services. Hence, even more rich people will use Bitcoin to dodge taxes. Income tax rates of 75% for rich people like found in France are the future. If you're not a tax-dodger already, Bitcoin will make you one.
-As people step over from other currencies to Bitcoin, other currencies lose value. Hence people will step over to Bitcoin to merely preserve their wealth, which will cause a further loss in value for old currencies, which will cause more people to step over to Bitcoin. We won't see this situation anytime soon, as Bitcoin is still too small to have an effect on normal currencies, this is the endgame however.

This is what environmentalists often argue actually.
Fractional reserve banking requires the economy to continually grow, because most money is created through debt, and more money will be needed to pay off the debt. As a result, civilization pursues permanent growth.
One reason I'm cautiously pro-Bitcoin is because I believe that a non-inflationary currency will encourage people to save their resources and consume less, rather than more.

There is evidence that one person owns 25% of the coins. [This Mathematical paper reveals that one entity owned 2.8 million Bitcoin at one point.]( He might own less by now, but there's no reason to assume this.


Well, if Bitcoin becomes a real deal, and becomes a new global currency when central bank currencies fail, enslavement would be a situation where one entity owns 25% of Bitcoin in existence, a situation where a single entity owns a quarter of the world's wealth.

There are people in India who have cell phones but live in shanty towns. Technologies can grow fast.
If they do 90% of their trades with people inside the village, they would put most of their savings in the local currency.
Personally, I would happily sell some savings I have in a mature cryptocurrency for an obscure alt that I believe has potential to grow.

This would not have to be a problem, as the difficulty adjusts itself downwards if almost nobody mines.
If we fear an attack, we will respond to this by mining, thus blocks are generated very rapidly and the difficulty goes up. We would then slowly have to build down the mining again, which would mean that block generation is temporarily lower. 
A solution to this might be to increase the speed of difficulty readjustment.


When the block reward ends we need to have found a solution to the 51% attack. Fees would be so prohibitively high that the protocol would essentially have become useless. After all, we will have to pay 100% of the difficulty subsidy in the form of transaction fees.

The earlier he dumps them onto the market, the better for Bitcoin and the global economy as a whole.
We can kind of figure out what early adapters are doing by looking at [this graph]( It would be better to have a minimum of two years though, instead of one, but oh well.
We see that whenever Bitcoin bubbles, people start dumping old coins onto the market. I certainly hope Satoshi does the same. Uncertainty is bad for the success of Bitcoin. We need to know whether those coins are still available or not, because the uncertainty is pressing down the price.

It will solve the problem. When an African village wants to trade on their local market, they can create their own new alt-chain, and everyone in the village can be an early-adapter.

As I explained, if I wanted to scam investors, I would bet as much as possible, to statistically drown out my scam bets with real bets, and use my insider knowledge to bet large amounts when I know the server seed.
This is why we see that Nakowa is responsible for about 75% of all money bet on just-dice. Nakowa isn't just a whale, he appears responsible for the majority of money wagered on the site.
After I'm done scamming and took the investors money, I would then invest a large portion of the money I won into the investors pool, and *go on a losing streak*. This would make it seems as if I lose as often as I win, despite not being the case, and in practice amounts to taking money from my left pocket and putting it into my right pocket.
@_date: 2013-06-07 12:53:59
Same reason it fell in 2011. When attention fades away, the price goes down. The reason for this is because when Bitcoin stays stable, it falls, due to higher inflation (1% inflation per month right now), which means that in practice it's not a good place to store wealth when there is no hype surrounding it.
[Compare 2011 to 2013.](
It was worse in 2011, because Bitcoin inflation back then was higher, due to there being fewer Bitcoin in circulation, and the block reward being twice as high.
We're probably in the slow motion part of the collapse again, and you just have to figure out the bottom of the crash and step in while we're there.
By 2015 it's time for another bubble, and even the people who stepped in at the height of 2013 (260) will see profit, just like the people who stepped in at 30 dollars and held made a lot of money.

No, there are objective differences. I've got a bank account I can access through the internet, and it uses verification codes that are sent to me by mail, to allow me to make any financial transaction at all.
If I were to send large amounts, the bank would ask for verification, and the bank can always see where my money went. I'm not allowed to withdraw large amounts either.
All of these are measures that protect me from great risk. None of them are found in Bitcoin.

Yes, because modern money is under inflationary pressure, and large inheritances are taxed. Both are incentives to spend your money.
You're looking at something that is more similar to gold or land, and history shows us that medieval dynasties lasted for centuries.


First of all, there's no clear evidence that the Rockefeller and Rothschild families still retain the massive amount of power they respectively held in the early 20th and early 19th centuries. To say they do would be to contradict yourself, as you just wrote "History shows that within 3 generations most great fortunes are spent". Power shifts from individuals to institutions, and although the Rockefeller *foundation* is very powerful, David Rockefeller's individual power is relatively limited, similar to how power in monarchies shifts from individuals to governments.

I've considered this too, but this still leaves the following question:
The coins have to be spent to be worth anything, but why would fat cats like Mr. 25% choose to be the first to spend their coins?
Considering that one coin equals 90 dollar now and assuming the price remains stable forever, Mr. 25% can get by in life spending 365 coins a year, which means that 100 years from now he will have spent 36.500 coins, or, 1% of his total coins. This is of course assuming that he doesn't invest his coins in a method that allows him to accumulate even more coins. If the price rises further, he'll simply receive incentive to spend even less.
Rather, the people who are likely to spend a large amount of their coins are the small owners, meaning that wealth is continually redistributed upwards, to the small consortium of massive owners. This would go on until everyone loses faith in the coins and goes back to bartering or something.
