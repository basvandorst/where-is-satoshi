Of course. But it is only the entry point for many to get them into the market. Seems like most of BTC price is supported by sentiment only and that could evaporate fast, or continue to build

So do you think it will dampen down the crypto price volatility?

Is there any evidence from equities that the futures trading activity significantly influences the market prices of the equity in question? I guess it means those who have the ability to PUD will take their greed games out of the crypto trading into the futures trading?

I’m quite new but my understanding is that wallet addresses to/from and amounts are public for most cryptos. So if someone knows you have a specific wallet and see you transfer to a second wallet they might as who you sent it to. So if authorities want to find out perhaps they could force that disclosure from you.  Probably missing something here!

I thought the purpose of futures is not to speculate but as a device to protect positions from volatility. That could actually have a stabilising effect of prices because big players would not need to reduce their actual positions because a futures product is insuring it - maybe I’ve forgotten how these things work in the equities markets

What do you mean by ‘blows chunks’ ?

I’m no security expert but unlinked may not remove the details from the exchange - plus, don’t forget to pull coins out of the exchange to a local wallet of some sort unless you’re trading them regularly ;)

Newbie here and bought most of the way down over the last week so breathing a sigh of relief seeing it start to come back well above my last buy. Phew. Lots of learning in the last week.

I’ve heard there are only 3,000,000 people in the world who hold bitcoin - very early days I think - though could be other cryptos that hold the future

Mind sharing which bank? I’ve not yet linked my bank to an exchange
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:25:39
Ah ok - does that apply to GDAX too?

It has to go through soon, and then I think it’ll fly for a few hours!

I’d heard about not linking your bank account to an exchange for security reasons - so put mine in via my MBNA credit card and took the 4% hit - and that was 30% ago now!

Of course, that’s why he’s put hundreds of millions into it - why would he say anything else?!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:53:55
That’s exactly it - can’t remember the detail or source but felt more comfortable that a credit card company would step in and stop it faster than a bank would as they are more accustomed to fraud monitoring I think
