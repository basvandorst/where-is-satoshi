Not BTC though... Blockchain? Yes - This article literally shows the negative side of BTCs crypto-market-cap %.

It really isn't great anyway. I've watched two seasons of the dome on netflix (shit too from what I have seen) and I couldn't even tell you whats happened thanks to watching GDAX..

Localbitcoin requires ID normally, but Localethereum does not - so you can buy and then exchange to BTC with your choice of payment from Paypal, Bank Transfer, Amazon Gift Card etc... Not the cheapest way, but it's quick and easy.

One time I bought some BTC it dropped 40% the following day, shit happens, it's not guaranteed instant income...

There are some seriously thought out projects on the way, probably two or three years from implementation but expect pre-sale and ICOs for them coming up in the next 6 months.

It's gone midnight here and I have a meeting at 9am, still gonna stay and watch the next few hours of madness! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:50
Important meeting in exactly 5 hours - sleep is for the dead - never thought I'd enjoy watching numbers so much..

I'm a technical editor for the whitepapers for a quite a few of them, the only related tech that has public with their whitepaper is Irresident and their project -  has more information, pretty sure they are not open for funding yet.

Bitcoins will be worthwhile long term, might seem dumb now but in a year you might not feel so dumb - if you HODL.

My alarm goes off in 45mins...

Brilliant news!

To move altcoins to BTC now or not? didn't expect this run!
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:42
I'm sure they will appreciate it - if you have the time to find them and leave a review of their whitepaper on facebook I can imagine they will be more than pleased.  -Also PM me and I'll let you know about the others when they go public. 
The future is closer than you and I imagined :D

Lightning will save BTC - without it, LTC and similar will have the upper hand - with the market cap and the speed BTC will be unstoppable.

Bought some at 135, and again at 150 - moved 50% into ETH the second it hit 300 - it will correct sometime soon so buy in the because it will go back up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:29:40
ETH is one to have some investment in - the tech is so different to BTC that the use-cases will not (and can not) be the same. LTC was great yesterday and I still hold mine, but I wouldn't move money out of BTC. HODL those BTC, give it time, once it goes parabolic we will be laughing.

It did that day, but it actually doubled within a month that time. I had BTC back in 2010 which would have been worth millions now. I don't regret it, I spent them at the value they were worth and then only got back into crypto this year.  I don't hold a lot, but if you want volatile then you need to move some of your money from BTC into alts..! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:10:17
With projects like the one over  coming soon, then ETH is way undervalued!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:46:26
That's exactly what happened last time, so I doubt it will repeat now people know what to expect when it goes live on the 18th.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:17:51
Diverse investments are good - however, depends on your alts. 
I would consider moving something like 50% of your profits from alts to BTC every week/month.  Then either leave the other 50% where it is (normally the best bet) or move it into new alts with good tech.

I look at this as a good thing as it only increases scarcity.
If only I had believed (understood) in bitcoin from the beginning, I could retire now - but throwing 100BTC dice online seemed so much fun back then when it wasn't even 10USD in total... If anyone wants to go through landfills in sweden theres some hard disks about a decade down with a few million dollars on!
