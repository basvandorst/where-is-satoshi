Maybe delete the app, download it again, and use the same Apple ID and password from the past. I did read your post but it's worth the try. 
Check if there's a 'forgot my key' or 'forgot password' option **ANYWHERE** on the app. Maybe 'recover wallet'.
The exact same Apple ID and password might trigger something. I'd honestly keep making new accounts with the Apple ID and password. 
Also, have you checked the notes or memo app? From what I understand it's the same phone so you might have it saved. Maybe connect the phone to a computer and check the files on the phone.
Check the email that is linked with your Apple ID. Check the email(s) you used in the time period you obtained the Bitcoins in.

From my limited research, I've found the following comments from a forum online:
"**It's gone.**
**The only hope you have now is to send the disk of the old phone to a forensics lab to try and recover the keys... however, since bitWallet is closed source... no one can tell you where to look except for the company that made the app.**
**For future reference: iCloud backups do not store identifying account data for apps... you should have noticed how after an iCloud backup restore he had to log in to everything again, and the only stuff that came over was mail accounts with iPhone's stock Mail app. Only local encrypted backups store login credentials for apps and secret data. (You have to perform a backup with your computer via USB and check the encrypt backup box.)**
**Lesson learned: backup now. not later.**"
"**If you know the Apple ID and the password for entering iCloud, FonePaw iPhone Data Recovery can help you to download iCloud backup files easily.
