No no, I wasn't going to use anything fake. I was wondering if there was any government websites that keep files of my info that I could access. I used a pay stub and after I scanned and sent it realized that its from over 180 days ago which = no good. If anything I will get a bank statement just wanted to fast track and get it all sent tonight.

I live with my parents all the mail is addressed to them. Will a bank statement suffice?

I expect that it will go down at some point in the next few monthes before it goes back up again, but thank you for responding I will consider it

Unless you live in the US coinbase wont work. Why don't you just use your bank account? I don't think you can use your debit card directly..

Yes I have a bank account and I can't find my statement, and I do pay my own cell phone bill but it's not in my name. Just give my parents the cash every month, I'm getting it in my name shortly.

I've been watching closely for about a week.. From $215 to past $300 this is amazing. Obviously kicking myself for not buying at the beginning of the week. Next week it'll be at $400 and i'll kick myself again.. I'm just waiting for it to drop around the $120-150 range and I'm pretty sure it will.
