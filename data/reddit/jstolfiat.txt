It's going to be a slow and painful journey. Pack enough sandwiches for 10 years please. And bring plenty of fiat with you as your tiny little BTC hodling might be worth a rather tiny fraction of its worth now when you start the journey. If you ain't got the stomach for it, bro, best stay at home !

Short term ? GTFO.
We dont need short term interests in bitcoin or in this sub. The cryptocurrency experiment started by Satoshi is still really a mewling puking babe and hasn't even started crawling. Feel free to stay around and contribute if you have a 5 - 10 year horizon, otherwise I think you would be better elsewhere (Have you heard of MMM ?).

Forget about the price tag !
PLEEEEEEASE !!
Just get working on / contributing to the debate to improve bitcoin and address all its defects and weaknesses. It is only by working on making Bitcoin suitable for mass market use that this will ever get anywhere. make no mistake, this is a long term 5-10year project. The price (in $ ??) is highly irrelevant so please stop obsessing about it, the more you do so the worse it looks and acts like a giant poinzi scheme and that is not what Satoshi intended. Buy a bit if you like, hold it or play with it for buying and selling but please do not ever think you are getting into an "investment" which is going to make you rich next year (or next month !!).

Oh, new here are you ?
Once you have been here for a while you will realize the following:
1. The $ price is volatile, as is the CNY, £, Euro price, etc.
2. There is blatant shilling all over the place to prop up the price and sing the praises of the coin. quite a bit is likely due to current speculators or holdlers looking for a profitable exit.
3. There are traders involved in short term speculation who like the price to be volatile and contribute to this if they can.
4. There may well be exchange manipulation and false volume / prices/ order book on one or more of the unregulated bitcoin exchanges.
You would be well advised NOT to consider bitcoin as any kind of investment, get rich quick scheme, etc. The timescale for bitcoin to become worth massively more than it is now could well be several years (go back, say, 2 years and have a look at what people were saying then).
However if you like the idea of cryptocurrency perhaps you could contribute to the work or the debate about improving bitcoin. Clearly it is nowhere near suitable for mass market use at present and needs changing.
also the rather large number of instances of losses, thefts and scams need addressing. You could start with a new year resolution to help get rid of the criminality in the bitcoin space. If you know of anyone using bitcoin for illegal or immoral purposes please report them to you local law enforcement agencies.
If we can clean up bitcoin, get rid of all the bad actors and downright criminals and get to work on making it suitable for mass market use there is still just a chance that in perhaps 5 - 10 years it will be sensibly moving towards this goal.

I shall be contributing to the removal of all the bad actors, dishonest persons and criminals that have infested the space. Both via direct action in reporting to local law enforcement any knowledge of scams, deceitfulness, etc and also by encouraging others to do the same. I shall also be working to promote the need for all those in charge of various bitcoin companies to be open and transparent with respect to their identities, work history, experience and (heaven forbid !) criminal record. In addition I shall continue to ask to publish full audited accounts of all those lovely BTC donations he "personally" received and to account for what he has done with them all.
This should help bitcoin to start moving from its present state to a rather cleaner one. For I firmly believe that only by ridding the bitcoin arena of all the current criminality will it stand a chance of becoming a world wide currency.
At the moment it seems to be a paradise for extortinists, drug dealers, anonymous purchase of KP and all manner of scams. Could we have just a bit more effort please to clean up this cesspool and then concentrate on the long term plans of recoding it so it has some semblance of usefulness in the real world. If we don't I fear it is forever to be doomed as a rather small minority interest "hobby" coin with a particular attractiveness to some of the worst elements in society (and I don't mean Libertarians - some of them are actually quite nice !).

I know of 3 early miners (2009-2011), 1 kept virtually all BTC and is now sitting on a pile worth in excess of $10 million, one sold most of his coins as the price went up, profited over $1  million but lost over $2 million potential profit on Goxx and other exchange exit scams. The other sold out (100%) when the price "skyrocketed" to over $10 and he is not a millionaire but had enough to buy a new car for the first time in his life.
I suspect the number of others with similar experiences is probably quite small (couple of dozen maybe ?).
@_date: 2015-12-27 08:59:52
An excellent decision (IMHO), irrespective of whether bitcoin succeeds or not, whatever the $ price on whatever exchanges are still around in 5 - 10 y time then real physical coins of limited edition will always have a value in the collectors / historical interest market. And if the coin is loaded then you always have a bit of a gamble on the BTC price sky rocketing. Of course you want to buy physical coins with very little premium to spot and when the $ / BTC price is low but maybe low is right now. I had quite a lot (several dozen) physicals 2 years ago but sold out around the highs of Mt Goxx when BTC was $1000-1200 as I was getting a huge premium over spot. I would look to buy back into physicals if we get to around $150-$100 on a sharp decline as the premium would probably vanish and a few desperate sellers (e.g. guys who had "put their life savings into bitcoin" ) might come out of the woodwork. Physical bitcoin total limited to 1% of total speculative investment portfolio.
@_date: 2015-12-27 08:53:21
Ok, lets talk about you and the price then. You say you have the majority of your life savings tied up in bitcoin. Do you think that is risky and somewhat of a gamble or are you superbly confident that you are not taking a risk but making a wise investment ?
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:31:36
The involvement of bitcoin in this little story is actually irrelevant. Whether OP used BTC, $ or magic beans to buy stolen cards makes no difference to the jury. Its his actions that count. Would a reasonable person consider it legitimate to buy something like a gift card for 80% off ?

In reality it matters not for there is fuck all you can do about anyone setting up any kind of blockchain for anything. It is a free world and many many organizations are already working on it for their own ends. Good luck to 'em I say.

We hardly need a predictor, technical cluelessness has been apparent here for literally eons. Lets face it - Bitcoin is complicated and using it safely without risk of SFYL *and* with preservation of true anonymity is certainly not trivial.
Unfortunately there are lots of "enthusiasts" who don't have anything like the necessary skills. This is perhaps not surprising. Bitcoin as a concept seems to attract young people with only a rough knowledge of cryptography , those interested in its use for things like buying drugs, politically motivated individuals who are anti government and have little understanding of the real world of finance and commerce, and (dare I say it) sad lonely neckbeards who post about human females !
Cluelessness is a pre-requisite for all these demographics.
@_date: 2016-03-04 08:00:18
It' technically interesting but it's not really what you should be looking at. A bit like monitoring the activity of one integrated circuit in computer and say the whole device is inefficient as that i.c. is not running as hot as all the others.
What matters, surely, in a cryptocurrency is the efficiency of transaction processing from the point of view of the 2 parties to a transaction. Alice and Bob want to be sure their transaction has completed satisfactorily in a reasonable time. They are not interested in the gubbins under the hood. Lets see the verified statistics on number of transactions, average confirmation time, fastest confirmation time, worst confirmation time and failed/stuck transactions BEFORE we start looking at block fullness or otherwise.

Quite right , I have no interest in the age of your account or your karma, who you really are or what your motives are. All that interests me is your "opinion" and, of course, the responses to it.
Unfortunately I am in a minority. Many on here, and indeed the mods, seem to place a vast store on karma, posting history, etc.
It is almost like a religious club or a cult. You are under suspicion if you are new, you need to toe the line and express the "right" opinion, and it is essential your views are popular (not down voted).
There are of course exceptions such as when theymos himself (*bows and makes sign of the ~~cross~~ coin*) garnered negative 800+ downvoting in some threads.

I suspect that there are 2 possibilities here, i.e. binary option. You would think that if you can count as part of your net wealth things like a house with a mortgage then you can indeed count it. On the other hand the continued existence of exit scams, thefts, etc indicate that there is a high risk of coin loss if you don't actually have full control of the keys. Even then you may need to allocate a proportion of your net BTC wealth to protective measures such as a second computer, running ubuntu, and tubes of epoxy. It might also be a good idea not to advertise your BTC on a public forum.
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:02:36
An excellent post. This is what it is all about. As a USER, my friend, might I just ask if you would like two possible additional features for your magic internet money:
1. Insurance against accidental loss or deliberate theft.
2. A chargeback facility to combat dishonest merchants.
Would you like either, both, or none of the above and if so, why ?

Excellent work, we do some stuff like this ourselves sometimes for fun/interest and sometime under contract. As I predicted well over a year ago it is the case that as time goes on and the blockchain gets longer it actually becomes easier to identify transactions with entities. In addition Moore's Law helps as does the continued additions to data which can be gleaned from places like this sub to identify transactions with usernames and other tags. 
Hopefully the result of all this will be more identification of the criminals involved in bitcoin space whether it be donations to ISIL , illegal drug purchases or just theft of someone else's coins. 
We look forward to Bitcoin being responsible for more and more criminals in our society being locked up and the arena of Bitcoin being "cleaned up" somewhat from its present rather sorry state.
In the meantime, while this work progresses, we encourage all those involved to report to the authorities any information they have on criminal or suspected criminal activity relating to bitcoin. I can assure you it will be noted and the authorities are *very* interested in hearing any information you have.
Perhaps if we can get this moving rapidly we can clean up the crypto arena and open the way for more interesting developments in the future.

Let's just have a look at (1) for a moment.


This "secured by..powerful computer" comment has been around for as long as I can remember (and I have been in crypto circles for over 2 years now). But what does it mean ?
Secured against what ? Let's consider some possibilities.
a) Secured against loss of the data.
Well the Bitcoin Blockchain may well be very secure against data loss as there are numerous copies residing in numerous data storage devices. However existing fiat banks have multiple copies and a pretty robust and carefully designed system of backups. So on that one I see no significant Bitcoin advantage.
b) Secured against malicious data alteration.
Theoretically you would think the Bitcoin blockchain is good in this regard. However there have been, and continue to be concerns against 51% mining attacks and similar scenarios and in addition history shows that the blockchain was manipulated in the past when it was deliberately "wound back".
c) Secured against double spending.
Surely this only occurs in Bitcoin and not in fiat. It is an "artefact" of decentralized money. So that's not a Bitcoin advantage over fiat.
So what, if any, can you suggest as d) where "secured" is relevant AND Bitcoin clearly wins over fiat. I am open to suggestions !

I think it all went downhill after this sub banned and who were doing a good job of providing a modicum of checks and balances against the criminal infestations, scams and hackers. And of course when you get a biased and one sided sub with excessive censorship we all know what happens eventually.

There is an interesting parallel in the world of religion. Consider some of the "loony" cults like JWs and Scientology. These tend to put people off religion even though a religious belief may well be to their benefit.
 If you get a high proportion of enthusiasts for bitcoin (i.e. this sub) acting in a way that is clearly biased, one-sided, closed to sensible adult debate, with a fair few rather unpleasant characters, extreme rudeness, issuing of death threats, doxxing, and other undesirable activities it can hardly fail to influence the opinions of the gerneral populace who happen to wander into this sub to have a look at what it is all about.
Instead of interesting and informed discussion from which they can learn about cypto they find something rather different. No wonder they then go on to dislike bitcoin. Perhaps if the mods had taken the attitude of encouraging sensible adult debate and banning those who were rude, offensive, biased, etc you might have had the opportunity to create a good impression of crypto and had rather more willing to give it a try.

Human error has occurred quite frequently in bitcoin and there have been several SFYL incidents like this. Bitcoin is worse than fiat in this respect because at least when someone else makes a mistake with banks you do get your money back. Make a mistake in bitcoin and its gone for good (no central authority to correct human errors).
Fiat accounts frozen due to illegal activity are pretty tiny % , erroneously frozen when actually not illegal infinitesimal. Sure if you want to do something illegal bitcoin may have the edge but is that really what you are suggesting as the USP for crypto ?
