I've been calling these coins Core and Cash, as there's fair discussion as to which one is a more authentic way to continue the blockchain built off of Satoshi's genesis block.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:35:05
Who stole the name? Cash is the original scaling solution. I'm very confused about Core changing course into.. what? A 1mb chain is nonsense, even with lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:25:48
Try google before making a fool of yourself
But it would also have been fine to know about micropayment channels, you'd realize ethereum is OBVIOUSLY capable of it.
Apparently cash fixed some but not all malleability.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:31:44
You realize micropayment channels already exist on btc and BCH, and that lightning will also be supported by both?
Just that scaling up the megabytes along with computational power allows you to actually do stuff with the blockchain, including lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:55:41
I'm not sure why you enjoy paying A LOT for it.

Segwit is like mastercoin. It's not the original bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:03:13
You're actually arguing against computation alltogether now!
How will anyone have any security if all we run is android or ios? Smartphones are builtfor features, not security.
If you don't want the power to run a full node you're not going to buy it. Desktop  is not dying, just not the cheapest computer device anymore.
Laptops will never equal desktops because their design parameters are different.

Talking to scammers is actually a very consistent experience. Perhaps it is valueable.

But how would it shatter? 8 megabytes are still really small.

It would all be fine if Core weren't basically crippled now.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:38:22
 LN does not exist.
Once it does, it requires micropayment channels. Micropayment channels work on ethereum, dash, decred, and bitcoin cash.
I seriously have no idea what you think is so special about bitcoin that it would only work on there. The blocks are small, therefore lightning works there?

Bsc, doing a master's
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:55:00
They solved transaction malleability, with a hardfork. Therefore the ugly hack that is segwit is not nessesary. It was there to keep it a softfork.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:53:40
Mainly they tried to allow the blocksize to scale with computers, rather than making the network useless through ludicrously high fee's.

You should at least explain what the definition of a product is. I don't know think "something that is sold" is a meaningful definition of "product", especially in advertising.
In this context some form of branding ought to set it apart in its category. Advertising for electric vacuum cleaners can only be advertising for a product if a product is involved.
But this isn't even really the issue. I think it is a parody because it makes fun of WU and is not (obviously) anyone's advertisement.

@_date: 2014-11-19 12:15:15
(1) It has nothing to do with what bits mean: data size has no relationship.
(2) it is not self explainatory. A dime isn't either, but a quarter is. Millibit is too, because only foolhardy people would use anything but metric.
(3) every other random word would do with less confusion and be less nerdy to boot! "Dragons", "stars", "ions", "reds", "nakamotos", etc. If you want even better advertising; "egol" from "electronic" and "gold",  "dimo" from "direct" and "money" but optically like dime, etc, etc
(4) it's size is not optimal by definition: the Bitcoin floats freely with little quantitive easing in multiple orders of magnitude. We would at occasion use bits where other denominations were prefereable. Bits cannot suffice.
Thinking about it makes me feel like bits is an immense net loss. Which is why I expected the eager-to-please freedom haters at Coinbase to implemented it sooner

Nope, sorry. Everyone will just have to get used to something not being the USD. Euro is set similarly to USD. Aside from that Asian currencies (including the largest currency, JPY) are in the hundreds or thousands.
Using the metric system is foreign to Americans, but not to /everyone else/, and remains the most effective way to deal with "unfamiliar scaling".
Little jokes like the one you suggest turn out insanely expensive in terms of code altered and rechecked. It's .. just not worth it. Especially because we actually only need this for people that are unfamiliar, or don't use mBTC or the likes. (Capital 'm' implies Mega, please avoid)

It's a surprisingly deep comparison, but in a strange way also flattering. Gaius was a very talented man, he just had some exceptional circumstances. To futher grievance he blamed himself, causing him to be mostly paralized to ongoing futher trouble. It would seem Mark had it coming, unlike Gaius I suppose; couldn't have expected female human shaped Cylons, but Mark could've expected theft (attempts).
So... in a "made disaster happen" sense perfectly apt. On a personality level: pretty unclear.

Yes, their privacy interest has changed. Iow: the meaning of privacy changes. You can expect people to republish such info as you've disclosed, or exposed. You may expect your publicly available information to be scoured and catalogued. Occasionally another right (esp. "Freedom of press") overrules privact rights more readily than it does for people that receive no public attention.
But not only is this FAR over (like impressively far over) that line, it is also fundamentally distinct from losing rights. Privacy isn't quite the same when you tell people all about yourself, but you have it in the same degree as others do.

The use of pro rata is a little confusing in this context. It is obvious you'd slice the pie in a fair distribution (related to how much dough people contributed).
It is not obvious which pie they'd be slicing. I assume they mean "everyone will be credited the Bitcoin they had when MtGox closed, but we throttle withdrawal". That's very reasonable, I don't think I'd be able to do better.
It would be MUCH MUCH MUCH worse if they cut whatever pie they have now, and call it a day. If that happens there's no telling how much anyone would get, but from what official documents now tell us (and assuming Midas and other assets are pretty much worthless, which might not be true) everyone would get &lt; 1/4th of their money back.
I think most of MtGox's customers would agree to anything to get their money back. I hope they will muster maximum decency in their manner of dealing with people.

You cannot really affect assets without explicit permission from the owner. Not even if it's back to where it came from. It all depends on what analogy you choose, and how you determine value.

Because now a Facebook currency unit is also a "bitcoin" according to the dictionary. "a type of" is not at all optional. In fact, Bitcoin is a name and not a "word" as such. "Google" is not "(a type of) search engine, which can be used to search the Internet", as in that case Bing would also be a google.
Google has been avoiding going down the "Xerox" path, where the brand became a verb that's not protectable. (Google is avoiding "Googled it on Bing"). Seems the dictionary took a shortcut and went straight to "I paid on Facebook with bitcoin" and it actually meaning "I spent FB credits".

As a duped person, of course you'd like others to give you money.
But I don't blame them for not doing it. I wouldn't bail others out either. It's our own fault first and foremost. Others shouldn't pay for that.
note: and the "public scrutiny" procedures that would be required to warrant such a bailout will cause degraded and more expensive service, with vastly decreased innovation. In acknowledgement of the decreased competitiveness and the fact that people that need it most will pick a business that's not bailout-approved (lower price), it would be required of everyone.

Alibaba is only good because there's sellers. There's sellers because sellers are Chinese. Chinese tend to spam a lot and are generally harder to "manage".
Honestly, Alibaba is a fucking mess. Taobao has been most impressive for me. Aliexpress is okay.
As a company the guys have been about as wise as any other Chinese corp that cloned a profitable foreign product, Chinese like Chinese. Foreigners like cheap. Chinese work for little. Ebay stopped innovating a long time ago and Amazon seems to have slowed down somewhat.
Problem is, online selling has been a pretty done deal for a whole load of time now. I honestly see hardly any competitive edge for one over the other at all. Actually, China's (subsidised) worldwide shipping infrastructure and cheap labor are making all the difference.

You're missing the point. The point is that the GOX2 owners have a conflict of interests. Or rather, their interest differs from yours.
GOX2 owners (shareholders that might've been creditors/debtors) do not want to give you money. And since they (legitimately) run the bizz, they get to set the terms of withdrawal. Those imaginary withdrawal costs could become less imaginary if the GOX2 owners decide so, and why wouldn't they?
If you had to choose:
A. Exchanging into shares
B. 15 year withdrawal scheme
C. Very expensive withdrawal
Which would it be? At least A -could- go to the moon! And this is not a false triochomy, we may well face such a choice in the near future.

This is expected as mining is competitive. The (expected) profit of mining in the most profitable manner is expected to approach 0. That means the costs (hardware, humans, electronics, risks) should nearly equal profit.

They're in it to make business, not anything else. That makes them a slow toxin for the ecosystem.
Sure, they'll push the envelope for their profit. There's overlap of interest in the sense of them providing service you'd actually like to use.
But, they will happily undermine anything in order to improve their position. Notably, you give up any premise of self-control or pseudonymity, and any Coin that moves through them acquires large (legal) traceability. They probably want the NSA on their side, and they just might be. (Manipulated funding is a common gov-support tactic)

I studied CS at the uni of utrecht, adhominem is weak, and no, one DOES NOT audit that much code and claim it secure. Formal methods for proving code are quite much more expensive, require pre-considered writing, and are not 100% proof.

You can go and pick between totalitarian regime, or oligarchy in which all markets suck outright.
I'm gonna go and say people shouldn't be allowed to operate in markets they're horrible at, to prevent the tyrannical stupidity we see today. 
I don't really CARE how that's achieved. I just KNOW it's a total farce to claim a market will achieve a good anything if you allow irrational, dumb actors to motivate it!
We're probably moving towards basic income! Imagine! Useless, dumb drones operate buttons and dictate markets without real penalty for moronic spending! Oh wait, we're already there! Every person that doesn't save, that lives month-to-month, is totally dependent and incapable of acting economically due to extreme coercion due to bad liquidity.
You should DESIGN GOOD MARKETS. That means getting good people to try be good companies (setting a race for fairly balanced competitors leads to best results, greater inbalance is greater slack towards optimal) and customers that can actually tell which one is doing well! Punishing those that spread misinformation (which can be crippling) is also valuable, but difficult in practice. Having a discerning professional customerbase is an alternative  (at least they have /some/ understanding of the product)

I was thinking "damn this post is so light on arguments" then it turned into a pro-segwit post and it felt comforting. At least now I know it's unlikely to be serious.
Protip: don't say something like "SegWit is ready.(..)We can revisit hard fork blocksize increases once we've exhausted the low hanging fruit.". It's just too obvious. Ready isn't meaningful in this context. No way a mayor protocol change is "low hanging fruit", and nobody could have a "safety first" mindset and recommend it over a wider anti-spam wrt blocksize!
I'm saying take your segwit and do it with your fellow segwittees. Go make "Bitcoin+sw", a Bitcoin fork that has the same history (or at least balances) as Bitcoin, up to a hardfork introducing SW. If you're right the price of Bitcoin+sw will rise. Regular market style.
Failing that, at least argue about how BU's incentives are wrongly set up. I suspect they might be fine. You certainly didn't give arguments either way.

Should be pretty easy to determine the "typical clock ticks per bit" for most algorithms. Once you know that you can factor the # leading zero's pretty easily. If you're off then the block rate will temporarily be off, not critical just bad.
Have to end with SHA to guarantee leading zero's is still legit, and start with SHA to guarantee SHA isn't compromised at all :)

Sigops? Per block effort is really linear with tx count.. 
30 tx/'s will be fine for a pretty long time, I think. And computer price is exponentially dropping - so increasing size IS BETTER THAN LINEAR.
I assume the extra time will allow some optimisations. There's hardly any implemented now because THERE'S NO NEED.

SatoshiDice is a great experiment, especially in trust. It is a fantastic example of possibilities.
And yeah, it also shows there's a lot of gambling addicts. 
Also, maybe some use it for laundering money? E.g.: Have 10,000 accounts send an amount of btc to rare-win-address, show the government only the rare-win cases. Seems as if you legitimately turned a few into many bitcoin! (Note: zCash allows this even better)
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:48:55
I think formalising some of the rule changing might make the game more transparant. It was definitely an oversight that no "forking ethos" is formalised. 
Arguably, Bitcoin1 should never see a policy change, hardforks should not happen except when a block was accepted erroneously. Given the weak spec, that's discussion enough.
Then bitcoin2, bitcoin2+sw, bitcoin2+sw+ln, bitcoin2+contract10, etc, should just be launched and the chaotic pricefinding etc. Should turn up better alternatives. This is unpleasant because HODL will break entirely.
Soooo.... hmmm. Is BU worse than the current situation? You mention a delicate balance - is this balance that good? We're stagnant on tx volume. Massive VC interests really stretching any remaining idealism superduper thin. I sure didn't expect the verocity, blatant lies, people getting away scott free, general lack of study (!).
So anyway, the question is, what's BU's balance, will it work out? It's easy to guess "probably not", which is why I favor something like a 1mb -&gt; ~2 to 4mb increase.
Anything else should be tried in an alt or fork, with a couple of million USD in bounty, for 3 to 6 months. imho..

More tx means more tx fees, so bigger blocksize means more cost to failing the chain. Precisely what spam resistance is.
No existing alternative has spam immunity either.

Hohohooo a true believer! Isn't that just cute? Markets "just are". 
Apple does not make the laptop market, and the tobacco companies don't compete on what they chose to compete in.
The structure of law and governance of companies, these things do not alter the economic landscape?
Within Reddit there is a deal of market effects. The whole "subreddit" thing? Total attention market, design such that users are intelligently spread (not to thick not too thin). Up/downvotes compete with bought ones - because spam is expensive to produce apparently. Etc.
But the way Reddit is build provides the economic landscape for other companies: imgur and similar are all dependent on Reddit's choices, and play within the landscape designed around Reddit.
Markets promote profitable behaviour. The idea that humans are good enough at evaluating products and price is false. Markets are constantly very dysfunctional. Prices are always unreasonably local, artificial product segmentation is common everywhere - meaning margins are rather loose, some markets are better than others. 
Companies seek to establish monopolies (see Zero to One and generally Thiel stuff) and often succeed, even though this is nessarily bad for customers. Game theory is not beaten at all.
People consistently undervalue immaterial properties. Things like energy consumption, actual longlivity, effects on privacy, effects on freedom of speech, sound production, etc. Often there properties are ignored outright.
Meanwhile brand and image is entirely overvalued. Your car isn't sold to drive you around, it mostly communicates something about you. Something about how you view yourself and your life, your character, your lifestyle. You'd argue it's for going places. Then you look at the cars and "feel right" about a car.
Humans are not computers, they're not rational, they're not exact. They're a horrid fit for economic anything.
When in groups the behaviour can be improved with the right techniques.

Telling me to educate myself. Again? Nice. Seems to be the default thing to say these days. 
I think you have a strange sense of what a soft fork is, to claim a chain is the same before and after the fork.
I get that you're pro segwit. Just please try an argument next time.
Wrt "miners get all power" but they are tied together. They can collectively decide a limit that's sensible. They have incentive to maximize their payout: meaning no huge blocks (fees would drop), nor teeny blocks (fewer fees).
I think that sounds like a decent incentive balance. You /do/ need an actual argument to make that different.
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:13:04
*because it just isn't important that so many do, which is why there's no sharding etc. (Partial nodes/ semifull nodes, that can rebuild a full chain together readily)

Yeah definitely a shill....
Everyone has to understand that a "rate limit against spam" has to leave a high enough rate to accommodate legitimate purposes.
Do you guys even realize that for every legit tx, 100 spam tx are no real problem? That micropayments for everything are totally feasible?
We just don't want /useless/ spam. 1mb was fine when there were hardly tx.
Bigger blocks are NOT THAT MUCH HARDER TO PROPAGATE. Read the original paper on scaling..
@_date: 2017-04-17 12:49:53
1st I'd rather have p2p. Also, not improving the situation, and smaller hubs are likely to be less secure. See how you pulled device security closer into the protocol?
2nd you're permitted to be clueless. "Loose lips sink ships" - small leaks make a big story. Every coffee's precise timing. Combine with smartphone usage, household power consumption, Internet traffic (size, timing, destinations), I think we're getting a sharper and sharper picture!
The argument that "this data is less significant than x" totally ignores how data isn't linearly specific. Data is typically exponentially specific - you answer more than 2x as many questions with 2x the data.
3rd This is false please read the original bitcoin paper. Remember we have a lot of potential optimisations that don't matter that much now, but will when there's huge volume. I believe we care about security, not fiscal omniscience, which makes that easy, but this is debatable. 
Maybe we have to wait for computers to catch up to bitcoin popularity. But now we're waiting for people to accept segwit or something else, and ignoring how regular bitcoin has no limit except something against spam that needs updating.
@_date: 2017-04-18 06:53:14
You big and small hubs are all exploitable, often with the same hacks.
You would not have small amounts in hubs - the cost of putting them there would be too expensive (tx fee is too high)
"Military grade" doesn't mean anything, and is not hard to implement. It does not naturally decrease your performance significantly. Whatsapp, dropbox, most modern companies, use crypto in meaningless ways to provide false security. Just fix that, and you're golden.
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:40:27
GPU is an ASIC for video games. If you make the hash the same as the video game, yeah, that might work. If you don't use vertex, pixel shaders, if you don't sample textures just that certain way, you'll have uneven useage and benefit from a mining ASIC.
These ASIC are made with the best procedures ("14nm") and the same machines as videocards. Being better for a specific purpose is their nature.
Cuckoo is probably also ASIC improvable, it's just tricky and less worthwhile than SHA. Cuckoo likely has a deal of unknown exploits and optimizations.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:39:17
Yeah.. gonna find an artificial financial reality with less dumbass anti spam, and super low costs, and high speed for all involved parties, including those that are very poor, without sacrificing practical security. 
Commodification is usually used to refer to the corruptive nature of profit. A badly designed market will reward behaviour that is undesirable or even malicious. Like how it overpowers Reddit and reduces quality of free speech - Reddit is close to useless in the face of profit seeking companies.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:52:53
It might make sense to have SOMSOM (SHA (block)) where SOMSOM is a collection of hashes that permutes every so many blocks.
A meta-hash-collection like that will introduce "cold ASICs". The MD5 ASIC will be useless sometimes, so will the sha1, or cuckoo, etc. That will increase the value of generic computing. By ensuring 9 units per 10 are cold, you increase the purchase cost tenfold without allowing better performance.
By periodically adding a new hash you could ensure ASIC managing is a huge headache at least :)
Security is not affected: the SHA265 will guarantee adequate security.

@_date: 2017-04-16 10:28:01
1st the notion of large hubs is anti-bitcoin. It's anti-distributed, anti-privacy, anti-reliability and availability.
2nd, you sound clueless about privacy and finances. Your coffee, when you buy it, where and how, is very valuable as a piece of a puzzle. Sufficient data about you makes you manipulable. If I know when you get coffee's, I can be a little more tactical. Stacked with other datapoints I know what you're thinking. Pretty valuable information in specific cases.
3rd - we don't need the current security factor - the expense is ludicrous. I guess it's neat if you regularly transact millions, but few ever actually do that. Even then you wait.. a week? Or just increase other assurances - like ask for ID so legal means become available. I don't often tx millions to people I don't have legal recourse on.
So how secure would it end up being, naturally? I'm not sure. It's an experiment. Perhaps it's wise to put the blocksize into miners' hands, if they maximize profit they should be creating a certain amount of scarcity: too many tx drops the price, too few drops Bitcoin utility.
I'm just scared it's actually designed to be pretty expensive.

We either keep tx fees low and volumes effectively unbounded or Bitcoin's growth will be negatively affected.

What you say is incorrect, and depends on a certain view of the politics.
You can share the load of validating a chain. No single node needs to check all the chain.
Miners also require consensus, so that risk is not so huge.
SPV still validates relevant parts of blocks, and keeps relevant blocks.

In this system you only trust those you select to trust. You cannot get random transactions out of nowhere. Only direct manually added connections.

@_date: 2013-09-22 19:54:12
This system trades trust in your friends for virtual things. Like tokens or Bitcoin. Then at some point you'll want to even out the unbalance you get after using your friends' trust. If you won't hand your friend cash money, you can do a bank transfer. Or you can give him loads of funny pictures.
Whatever settles the score for you. But it's personal, between you and those that trust you (up to x monetary units). The bank will be involved with you and the other, but not the system directly.
