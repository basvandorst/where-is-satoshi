Could you try this one ?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:52
Thank you, it worked :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:08:27
No problem. I got 10 days left, see you then.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:34:11
Of course, as soon as I finish collecting. In 10 days. I’ll either edit the sub or write a new one.

I agree. I didn't intend on disclosing the result to that question alone, for the reasons you mentioned, but also because the aim of my study is more on the perception and behavior of bitcoin/crypto owners.
Good remark tho :)

Thanks for your input, I’m saving all of this :)

Buying any fraction is possible and worth it, otherwise some of us here couldn’t afford to buy any bitcoin. Most people who say they own bitcoin do not own a full bitcoin, that’s currently a lot of money. 
I suggest you make a 100 bucks bank wire to your Coinbase account, this is the way with the minimal fees (in Europe, but I guess it’s the same in AUS)

Maybe he loved pizza so much that he spent all of his coins ?

Thanks for your comment. 
What exactly do you mean by sampling bias ? I’m trying to target people interested in cryptos, possibly the ones who own some. I won’t use the raw answers to ‘are you familiar with’ and ‘do you own bitcoin’ on standalone graphs, but rather ‘of all the people who own Btc, x% agree with..’ etc. Is the sampling bias a problem in this case ? 
Also what do you suggest for the age divisions ? 
Thanks

Neither, mate. The ‘there’s an infinite number of tulipes’  cracked me up. That’s all. I don’t need much to laugh, you see.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:38:10


I agree entirely here. 


What about Bitcoin Cash ? I see it's hated on here, but couldn't both live peacefully side by side? BTC for buying a house, BCH for paying your coffee.

Haha ok I was afraid you were dead serious about the tulipes for a second. XD

Step 1 : Collect underpants
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:23:49
If you read this, that’s not my second account XD

I didn't express myself correctly, what I meant was 'no third party involved in the transaction = no fee to pay for that third party'. That's what I have been hearing all along from the start by bitcoin defenders, and it might have been true one day. But there actually is a third party involved (the miner) and you actually pay them a fee, a rather high one when it comes to small transactions.

Thanks for the info. I’m not that Blockchain savvy.. yet.

Coinbase is a popular and practical option to buy bitcoin. There’s a 4% fee when using a debit card, but if you do a SEPA wire I believe it’s free (or at least it has much lower fees).
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:20
Thanks ;) And happy 6000 ! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:37:41
I've been staring at the picture for like 6 seconds and I'm not getting it, mate. What are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:34:17
Your first transaction has a fee of 0.000658 btc which is roughly 3,5 usd.
That’s a pretty high fee considering one of Bitcoin’s main arguments was ‘no central authority = no fee’.
A bank wire from my phone is free, but then it takes 3 working days..
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:04:05
Thanks for the suggestion. I’m actually mad I didn’t think of it in the beginning..
