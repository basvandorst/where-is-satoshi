Thanks.  I'm going to try patience and when that doesn't work.  I'll wipe it and reinstall in ubuntu... Don't know why I didn't in the first place.

Ya I realized the issue related to a corrupted block chain.  What happened was that after the last windows update my computer started freezing kinda regularly so I had to force restart.  The bitcoin client doesnt like being stopped unexpectedly.  I was able to reproduce the issue a couple times.  I reverted back to a previous state now I just have to download the chain.

Any idea who it is or how to contact.  I wish there were a way to send a big thank you out to the people in mountainview for being so on top of things.

This is very helpful.  if I have more issues with windows stability I'll try these out. or just run in linux where I don't have any stability issues.
If only you could play videogames on linux...
Microsoft.... pissing me off since 1988.

If I uninstall and reinstall the client will I loose my recieving address?  I saved the address and wallet.dat file.

Its not a firewall issue unless its a tricky one.  Could the client be showing connections but not downloading new blocks?

I'm showing 8 connections but I'm at 129466 blocks and honestly it hasnt moved in a while

I know this isn't a big thread or anything, but I eventually got inventory from the vendor in the link.  Their CS never responded and the phone number was disconnected, but I got the inventory, so It wouldn't be fair for me to not update.

If I get this figured out and recover my shit. you get a tip or gold or something.

Why does bitcoin as a legitimate currency equate to financial collapse?
