Your wife is amazing!

funny shot :D

or one could show the buyer other projects that you have worked on and the buyer can now make his or her own judgement on whether to hire you for the job or not

I've heard about that kind of thing too, I remember reading somewhere about a guy who had a degree in Aerospace Engineering or something and did that and ended up getting a job.

I don't get why they did this... I mean this screams 'failure'... :/ This is horrible news, where have we come to if even such a Pro-Bitcoin country decides to drop the support for it? At least the price didn't tank that hard...

Here's what I do, and it always creates a "wow" moment and a real convert.
I go to bitcoinpaperwallet.com and show them how to print a random paper wallet.  I explain the difference between the public address and the private key.  I then show them my Mycelium wallet and send some BTC to the new paper wallet.  We go to blockchain.info to explore the concept of confirmations, and we talk very briefly about miners and their role. I then hand them the paper wallet as a gift.  This is a magical experience.
I then provide them some info about how to learn more on their own.

It's good for me to read news about BTC, because future is coming, new future. And bitcoins are part of it.

I hope that American Bitcoin Conference will open a new horizon for us.

It looks a bit like a Ponzi Scheme, as early adopters have an incentive to make bitcoin more poplular and more adopted for their own sake.
But most definitely it isn't. Bitcoins are sound money and have all proprities of such, namely: 
A currency must be divisible so that units of its value can be paid to match the value of your purchase.
For a currency to be convenient, it must be portable. You must be able to have access to it at any moment to spend it and you must be able to receive it just as easily.
Money has to be sufficiently rare. If the medium of the currency is easily obtainable or reproducable, it will have little worth and be easily counterfeited.
Every unit of a currency must be equal in value. Diamonds are not fungible because there are other properties of a diamond that makes it worth more or less than any other diamond: size, clarity, cut, purity, etc.
Money must not have a property that allows it to decay over time. Any perishable items are a good example of this: Vegatables, Spices, Tea, Milk, etc.
and 
The value of bitcoin is completly ruled by the market and basic law of supply and demand. The value of bitcoin is not determined by how much people think they are worth, it is determined my market forces, in the same sense that one kilogram of gold or one liter of water has the value that the market determines and not the value that people, individually, think they are worth.
But, of course, people are always free to sell them or not, for any price they want, driving the market forces.
Bitcoin is great because it is the separation of Money and State, and the end of fractional reserve banking.
It is fascinating and has a great future! So much potential to change the world...

It would have to be before 1996.  There were 36 million internet users in 1996.  Maybe the internet in 1990.  I used the internet in the 80's.

I just keep mine simple: one hotwallet and one offline cold storage.
I'll never bother to with a bunch of 1btc paper wallets, that's just more to manage, and sometimes transactions are more than 1btc.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:12:27
The volume will increase dramatically in the near future:
Bitcoin doesn't need to replace fiat, since paper money is going to collapse "smart people" will need a way to protect their wealth.
As long as digital currency has a modest % of global trade, then the volume of transactions will be huge.

France changed its tax rules regarding Bitcoin sales before and know they want to implement a higher plan?
It's not good. French governors are out of their mind.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:12:01
Bitcoin is the future of money.
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:36:33
add it to my deep freeze storage and wait for more...
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:11:30
If physical bitcoins come in market, then people will switch to another crypto currency..because BTC will loose its shine for what its known for...and govt will also make tons of policies regarding btc.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:25:41
If they start getting the internet and figuring out how much the clothes they make sell for: the government's fucked.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:11:19
I would better invest that money in stock market. Although risky but pays well if you know the market.
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:36:16
Is coinapult official involved with this?
Is that service run by reputable members of the community?
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:13:03
This is great news! Especially considering all the small vendors that are starting to use bitcoin as payment and use coinbase as an exchange and wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:36:47
Hong Kong as it is easy to open a bank account there.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:28:38
lol. I gave him a dollar... Its always good to see Bitcoin in the news. Wish he would have written "Bitcoin" instead of just the symbol.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:59:48
Does it mean that eBay will accept bitcoins soon?
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:30:20
You can buy a vehicle but can you buy a petrol with bitcoins?

1.5 million - is a population of big city!

Yet another proof that bitcoin is becoming mainstream!
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:12:44
Most companies do not allow you to combine promotions. I would find it very unlikely that they are loosing money on this deal. Merchants usually offer these kinds of deals because they want to get additional sales to their store, while remaining profitable. If they were loosing money on people taking up this offer then they would have on reason to offer it in the first place.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:26:11
I don't think this is true. If it was there would be a lot more reddit like sites out there.
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:02:23
Interesting article! Useful information about bitcoins and taxes.
