It was the pc desktop version, nothing to download

Desktop version, I say this because it was not an android app or apple app, I logged into the website address blockchain.info clicked wallet, clicked create a free blockchain wallet (which I still have) but the 2 addresses I made DISAPPEARED/not there.

Are you kidding me, stop trying to protect your insecure website! I'm 100% sure it was the real blockchain.info website, not one bit of doubt! no newbie here. I still have the wallet with just the original address, if I sent the mbtc it to the original address I would have my bitcoins. I've been involved with bitcoins for about 4 years now, never loss any bitcoins,  I'm no fool, the only foolish thing I did was use/trust blockchain.info, never again. Maybe their app in android and apple is ok, but I will not risk it.
Here are the addresses of the btc lost they will never move 16XQzV2bTNXq9ASudtBqSWFYsUBJVXq2xU

I have nothing to gain from this, I'm just pointing out a bug with the software/platform of the blockchain.info network/website, and the people over there want to hide from responsibility. Thank goodness I keep paper wallets for my  base, I feel it is the best. Take my word or not, I speak only the truth, just like the bitcoin network, true.
