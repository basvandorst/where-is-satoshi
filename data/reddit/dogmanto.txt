The market is down over 1 million lambos today. But if I had some fiat, I'd probably be loading up soon.
It doesn't help that coinbase isn't letting new users deposit. Whyyyyyy!
F*ck you Santa.

In before "Ripple, Monero, Etc" aren't shitcoins. Maybe so...
But remember, there's only 1 King :P

Glad you saw that :P 
It's the little details :)

50 days till we see Bitconnect LTD dissolved by the UK Companies House. Trevon James claims he got "hacked" and all his bitcoin dissapeared. The hammer of justice is coming down soon.
 doesn't advertise ponzi schemes unlike CoinMarketCap because that stuff sucks.
Happy Thanksgiving!

Hope you GoT fans out there like this one. Wasn't able to make a cartoon yesterday due to lack of ideas.
If you want to see more, tweet me at  or DM me here.

There's a duty of care when you're making recommendations to your followers for ICOs.

Telegram works too. Always looking to connect with smart people.

If you're going to use Live Coin Watch in an iframe for your top 100 list, you should be linking back to  in your list of resources and not cutting off our logo.

You're going to die when we see what's up in the next few days. Friends and I were cracking up just talking about it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:46:24
Will check that out!
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:50:18
I'll keep making new cartoons if you guys like em :)
Please DM me here for on Twitter if you have good ideas for more. It's a fun break from trading to flex my artsy side.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:31:04
Bravo hahaha - Can I get your permission to do a cartoon based on this?
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:14:04
I call dibs on Bitcoin Plutonium. 
If you like these, I post em on my twitter as well.

I feel 0% bad for any of them. But I do think they should get some magenta and teal suits with their crypto money.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:24:40
That would be pretty funny. Good on them though. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:10:44
Smart dude for sure, but I view any of his endorsements as the equivalent of Paris Hilton or Floyd Mayweather now. Just a celebrity trying to pull some free coins rather than an advisor who's going to lead the project to greatness.
I'm pleased that the market has adjusted so well to ignore these celebrity attachments - knowing that they're mostly meaningless.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:06:23
Appreciate it! Got a real funny one in the works that I came up with in the shower. Back to the trading grind though :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:05:10
Appreciate the love I got on my last cartoon. Going to keep trying to make new ones daily :)
If you have funny ideas DM me here:

Dude where's my shitcoin?

Keep calm and hodl on

Not a bad consolation prize :P
If bitcoin goes 25x from now, they'll be sitting nicely (not that they're in a bad situation right now lol)

Of course, but if you think Zuck wants the Winklevosses to succeed, you're probably wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:09:32
If you have any ideas for new cartoons, feel free to DM me here or on twitter -

You can switch the base currency in the top. The UI and performance should increase next month with our new version.

Realtime data takes a little long to process but our new version should be a lot faster coming out in May.
