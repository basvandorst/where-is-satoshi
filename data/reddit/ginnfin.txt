Essentially every dip in every asset class has been bought since 2011... you're only right until you're not

That is NBBO, and it took the American exchanges 'til 2007 to implement it.

Because JPM is one of a handful of banks that gets to market make in treasuries and store their money at the Fed for .25% per year.
In other words, they have absolutely no reason to change the status quo. They have every reason to destroy an alternative, any bulge bracket bank does.

The bids and asks definitely are not accurate right now.
And with this kind of volume/lag, the price range that trades are getting executed at right now has got to be extremely wide, +/-10% at the very least.

You obviously don't know how markets work. Rule  is don't fight the tape; if I had BTC I'd be selling right now... short selling if it was really feasible with BTC.

Fine if you insist on groupthink, BTC looks like shit technically right now. 20% in 3 hours is a crash.

You have a massive misunderstanding of what HFT is or does if you think it was involved in the BTC crash.
If, which is a big if, someone did spam Gox with hundreds of small trades per second, that is much more like DDoS and not HFT.
HFT largely uses quote stuffing to find the true 'elasticity' of the market. Then, they use large $ amounts in extremely short amounts of time to buy through thin bids or asks and then buy cheap or sell expensively.
