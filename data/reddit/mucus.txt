I'm not talking about internet providers here.

Obviously you have not experienced the true nature of the web and are observing it merely with an economist's eye. The internet is much more than that, it is the first **real-time global connection** between all humans. This is the first step towards the collective conscious, the next step of our evolution. Or at least that's how I see it, but that's not even the most dire point. At this present moment, the internet could be a tool of culture, education, free-thought, debate, liberty, discussion, sharing, etc. and instead we've seen numerous attempts by corporations to regulate it, monetize it, control the flow of information, may it be for (very dubious) political purposes, or for stacking the green without looking at the greater picture. **Money isn't everything.** I'll say that again. Money and markets and power are NOTHING next to our species potential for cultural and technological breakthrough. In fact, I believe that your disposition against net neutrality is a consequence of our technological evolution being much faster than our understanding of the moral and philosophical implications of this change. Hopefully in the future everybody will understand that this world-wide-web is much more than just a market, and in fact is the next step for the advancement of our species beyond our bioological barriers.
Erm, too much sci-fi?

I'm not advocating for the end of currency, I'm just saying that removing net neutrality for money purposes is valuing money over personal freedom and social culture.

Completely wrong. What about SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, Facebook, Twitter and all the other Silicon Valley residents? What about vicious advertisement companies, what about BuzzFeed?

What goods are scarce in this case?

That's the problem with the current economic panorama, seeing the internet as yet another terrain to monetize, while we despise its much greater cultural and social value. I won't even get into the whole evolutionary aspect of why we shouldn't be controlling, wiretapping, and (unjustly) regulating the web.
