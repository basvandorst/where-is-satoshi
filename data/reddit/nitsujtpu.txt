Sheldon Cooper used a Willow Garage Texai, and the Texai was inspired by previous telepresence robots.  People have been doing this in some form since the 90s.

Armed with a .22 LR plinker.  Watch out Ocean's Fourteen, your target is packing some real heat.

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE WORLD!?!?

Except for not really.

I have.. but now I live in a world in which ATMs sell things and vending machines give you currency.

Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.

Satoshi was a researcher with an interesting idea.  Once he figured out that he could actually make money on it, he went underground instead of publishing his research findings.  It really is that simple.

All good, but even his profile says he likes precision shooting, as in the gallery match.  Glocks are more common in practical shooting matches, like steel.
Edit:  Though he also mentions 25 and 50 yards.  The gallery match is shot at 50 feet.

Hey bud,
Why don't you trash on my country more while browsing reddit.com (an American website), over the internet (which grew out of the ARPANet, so, funded by American money)?  While you're at it, you can use your computer which probably has an Intel (an American company) CPU.  If not, then it almost certainly has an AMD (an American company) CPU.  Of course, computer hardware grew out of the work of many scientists, notably Alan Turing during his time at Princeton (an American university).  He used it to save the world during WWII, after the Nazis invaded your country.
But, you know, we're just a bunch of screwups over here.  That's okay.  We won't hold our victories over your head.

So, if this was 2012 and you were buying 5 of something in Bitcoin, am I to take it that this was 5 marijuanas?

No mention of a gun, just a profile.

Way to keep it classy.

Wall Street crimes don't generally deal with physical dollar bills.  In fact, neither do I.  I usually use a credit card, wire transfer, or other option.  Physical money is a thing that I've generally only used in vending machines and parking meters.

Well, I upvoted the explanation, despite the fact that I found no relevance at all to Bitcoin.
