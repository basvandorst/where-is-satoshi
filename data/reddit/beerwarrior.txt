Yeah, that must be it.

Why do people here hate credit cards so much? I get cash back by using mine.

Lots of handwaving here. Is this good for bitcoin or not?

That's called having paper-thin trading. It doesn't take much to push the price in either direction.

I saw that Steam stopped accepting Bitcoin. It takes a lot of barber shops in small towns who are accepting BTC to match what Steam brought. That's a big, big loss to the ecosystem. So that seems to contradict the narrative that you have here.

I provided data to say that adoption was decreasing. OP disagreed with my assessment. I think it’s reasonable to ask for counterpoint data. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:59:43


What data are you using to make that claim?

Traffic is at a 2 year low according to what I see. You presented no contradictory evidence. I guess you’ll believe what you want to believe, with or without evidence.

Real world usage is skyrocketing in recent months, if by "skyrocketing" you mean "[down to 2 year lows](

Uh, great comment here.

Real talk? I decided that Bitcoin as it is would never be easy enough for the average person to use as a payment method. And the fact that the community was obviously not mobilized to work on that issue and instead preferred to bicker over petty things reinforced that decision.

Ok great. Thanks for your useless replies and downvotes.

There's one by my house. There's a sign on it that says that the store owners don't know how it works, so please don't ask them. Never seen anyone use it. Mass adoption soon though.

Yes. Warren Buffett is pretty clearly an idiot.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:44:00
So, what data are you using when you say that usage is skyrocketing then?
