Then I see the transaction, but not the amount of confirmations. Or do I oversee something here?

BCH trading on GDAX will reopen at 17:00 UTC (9am PST). Interested to see if that big BCH sell pool will pile up like yesterday. HODL BTC owners, or step in now!

Thanks for the reply. While gathering some more insight I found out that the fee I paid is: 0.0022386167146974064 BTC per kB
You have any insight in yours? Good luck! ;)

Interesting thread, let’s see what the days leading CME launch will bring us.
Any good website that shows us these sell walls?

Today I transferred BTC from my trezor to Kraken.com. How long should I expect this should take? I've used normal fees, and have been waiting for +/-7 hours now.

When you’re mind is set to that new car, and you have one already.. overthink your need for a new car. Always pay off your debts first. When you put your money in bitcoin it’s no longer yours... until you sell. But what if the price drops? Read the post about not investing recklessly... it’s not rocket science.

But 36 hours? Quickly calculated 98000 transaction with ~5transactions/sec = ~ 5,5 hours

11am PST, 6 min from now trading will resume

Where can I see how many confirmations my transaction has. I transferred BTC from my trezor to Kraken.com.

That message on the topside of the page about GDAX being in degrade mode is gone.

Or 17:00 GMT, pick your format

Bitcoin Hard Fork December 12: 
So we just passed block 498888. According to the tweet they just posted ( there now is another hard fork of bitcoin called:
SUPER BITCOIN
They promise to feature:
1. Smart Contracts – Unlike the original BTC, SuperBTC will be able to support smart contracts just like ETH.
2. Lightning network – It is way faster than the original BTC after which no one no longer needs to wait ages for transactions to occur.
3. Zero Knowledge Proof – This tech will allow one to hide their wallet address when performing transactions.
4. Bigger Block Size – This will allow more scalability on the chain itself for the coins to thrive.
Apparently they’re backed by Bitfinex in the list of supporters they posted. Let’s see....
Anyone knows if TREZOR / LEDGER are supporting this too by claiming the new coin in their apps?

Can you screenshot? I don’t have a GDAX account, I’m on Kraken
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:43:04
Indeed, it’s back
