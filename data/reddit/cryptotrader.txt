Homeboy, although I feel sympathetic for your loss, putting your fortune into magic internet money was not the brightest thing to do. I hope you eventually make it to college but this experience is probably a lot more valuable than anything they will teach you. You cant learn street smarts in school.

Wow, check out the comments on that post. Thats it, im gonna leverage my house on BTC right now. This thing has a looming way to go (up).

I work from home and this is exactly how I act when my wife sneaks in and I'm trading crypto instead of working.
Wife: What are you doing?

It's totally obvious too, we're just this year seeing institutional investors now taking notice (Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust $GBTC on Nasdaq, JP Morgan FUD, China, etc.). Bitcoin WILL surpass 10k soon and keep going. By the looks of this meme chart the top looks like its around 80k thb.

Yes, a Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal points (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC). I guess 1 Sat can be compared to 1 Cent as it is the lowest denomination for the currency, that said 1 sat isn't equal to 1 cent (obviously).
Also, its no different than say, going to McDonalds at the airport in Japan. The price would most likely be listed in YEN but when you swipe your US credit card it will do the conversion to USD. The same thing would happen with bitcoin if it gets to that stage of adoption. Prices would most likely be advertised in the local currency but your Bitcoin Credit card will to the conversion form USD to BTC automatically and deduct from your BTC balance.
Hope that makes sense.

Meh, you should have moved their funds to an exchange and Dollar cost averaged you buys as we're still going down and will continue to for a while. If you REALLy wanted to impress them that is.

@_date: 2017-10-13 07:49:24
Isn't it a moot point to compare bitcoin to a security asset? Stocks are not divisible, bitcoin is. Stocks and crypto are not comparable why isn't this widely understood?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:52:24
They are generally safe you just might not receive your forked coins depending on where you store them.

This is dumb and you don't understand how to read a chart. We're not even to the first sell-off yet, currently, we're in Q2 of the awareness phase.
Learn to quantify the Mean of the global crypto charts and you can see more clearly.
Typical noob meme post, nothing to see here.

Of bitcoin? No, 1 Sat is the lowest (and always will be) denomination.

I'm sorry that hurt your feelings. You shouldn't be so sensitive in the first place. That said, you clearly don't know what you're talking about and I thought I gave you a valid response. Do you see that not all alt coins are "lagging behind"? I'm just trying to help you see that.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:25:27
What you're describing is called having weak hands. What a lot of noobs don't understand is that you shouldn't worry about the price of BTC just worry about how much BTC you have. Keep trying to get more BTC regardless of its value vs. fiat. In 1, 2 even 5 years you'll wish you bought more at these prices.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:58:23
Sell when bitcoin is over $10k silly. Or hold longer if you want more gains.

Afaik an ID for Coinbase is mandatory. If not, looks like you're out of luck. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:17:15
Assuming it is valid and fits the criteria requested by CB and Kraken it is really bizarre that two separate companies cannot validate your identity or accept your given ID. I would ask them specifically what the problem is and go from there.
I'd imagine you didn't submit a clear image or there is something wrong with your ID in general. Again, it is strange that two unrelated companies would both deny your ID submission without giving you an explanation as to why. You're either doing something wrong or are very unlucky.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:10:16
Is it an American drivers license, a student ID, a badge from work, a passport???.... What kind of ID are you submitting to them?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:54:54
You don't really know what you're talking about. Do you only look at the front page of CMC? At a quick glance I count over 50 Alts that are up more than Bitcoin (percentage wise) right now. Some over 1000% in just 7 days or less.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:39:14
As crypto progresses and becomes adopted by more and more people I think other coins will be used as an everyday currency. Bitcoin will continue to thrive as a store of value, but as you said, people have been working on scaling bitcoin for a very long time. I don't think people will wait for bitcoin to be fast and cheap before they start using something newer, built specifically for everyday transactions that is already fast and cheap.

BTC isn't an efficient everyday currency and to think of it as such is short sighted. It is used for two things mainly, as a digital store of value and as an asset to trade for other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:49:48
Anybody can create their own crypto currency it doesn't mean people will adopt and use it. I can start a band tomorrow, if my music sucks or I'm just not that cool, nobody will support me. Crypto works the same way.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:57:06

Brilliant OP. What a fucking incredible thread you've started. Can't wait to see the responses. My mind is blown by the intelligence emanating from your words and the thoughts behind them. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:01:41
So when somebody buys something with BTC your gonna make them wait for 45 minutes to confirm? Why not accept a faster currency instead?
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:46:32
It's annoying when valuable information, discussion and insight gets buried by stupid questions and other worthless posts that can be answered on your own faster and with less effort than creating a new post, essentially asking to be spoon fed very basic information that is very easy to locate with a little bit of fore thought and common sense.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:06:16
If governments could ban bitcoin why wouldn't they have done it the past decade?
They can create their own crypto currencies, if they wanted to they would but they haven't. If they did, nobody would support them.
Do you understand why satoshi created bitcoin? I would suggest doing some research on your own.
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:08:56
Honestly $10 won't get you very far, it is good however just to practice with but if you really want to turn that into $1000 you need to find a low volume, low market cap coin that hasn't mooned yet. That coin isn't going to be on bitfinex either.
Again though, it's good to practice trading with to get the hang of things. Once you feel comfortable drop like $500-$1000 (or more) to start seeing substantial growth!
