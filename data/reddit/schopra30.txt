Dear Douglascrets, you are absolutely right.People always used to store their wealth by converting it into gold. However, with Bitcoin gaining popularity and by virtue of its properties of limited supply and consistent increase in value, people have now started looking at  bitcoins as a means to store their wealth.

Around 24th May price of bitcoin started rising from $430 onwards. In 20 days it has risen by more than 50%The rise has been very steep. Mainly this is due to halving effect and also due to devaluation of yuan currency since most of the transactions are coming from China.

Yes you can definitely buy bitcoins in Brazil and later on sell them in Mexico. That is the advantage of Bitcoins. Bitcoin is a global currency. Yes you have to be very careful with regard to bitcoin pricing since Bitcoins are vulnerable to wide fluctuation in prices. However if you fundamentally understand Bitcoins, you can very well take a calculated risk that bitcoins prices will increase over a longer period. So whenever you shift to Mexico and find Bitcoin price lesser than your buying price, just wait for some time. In the long run, you wil definitely get much better price.
