Yeah I saw a post about the success of the LN yesterday I think. Going to try to educate myself on the matter over the next couple of hours.

so what is it exactly we're trying to brute force? the password to your Blockchain account that contains the wallet with the given public key?
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:27:47
Looking at it now. Wouldrecommend? I imagine you use this regularly and don't run into any issues?

How did you buy it with an iphone? I thought apple didn't allow any apps that supported bitcoin?

Please introduce selling for Australia, Coinbase!

What is to stop someone from buying coins on this exchange, then sending the coins to an account on another exchange to sell? Is it just a case of not prove citizenship/PR in Brazil, therefore not being able to buy coins on a Brazilian exchange?

That's fucking awesome!
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:30:43
Super appreciate this answer!

Sorry my financial terminology isn't the best, but I think I know what you're asking. I guess I'd buy on cheaper xchange, send BTC to expensive one, sell for USD, withdraw and deposit back to cheaper xchange to buy more BTC than before? Not sure what btc/usd exit strategy is :S

General consensus is that there will actually be a decision/announcement? If there is not, we'd have to wait till 5pm on Monday to be sure there was a default approval, right? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:49:25
What time zone will the decision be made in? Also, at what time? I'm in Australia, it's a bit hard to track!
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:30:59
Thanks for the clarification!

In a few days/weeks/months when the price has increased even more, you will kick yourself that you didn't buy today. Buy now.
To protect yourself against spikes in price, buy a small amount regularly. Personally, I have a standing order of $100 a week.
