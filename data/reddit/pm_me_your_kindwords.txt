Probably a combination.  However, the vast majority of people (in the US) can get their children vaccinated either for free or very low cost.  Most insurance covers it for free or low cost, medicare covers it for free or low cost, and people without insurance can get them covered through a government program.  Info is here: 
While the US healthcare system is a mess, coverage is available for children with low income parents.  
In fact, according to [CNN]( (warning, video plays automatically):

Well if 96% of one state is vaccinated, then it isn't possible that more than 4% of those children *can't* get vaccinated, right?
If less than 4% can't get vaccinated, and in some states the non-vaccinated rate is as high as 14%, then there are 10% (14%-4%) who are not vaccinated but who *could* be.  Now I can't say if the parents of those 10% chose not to or just didn't get around to it yet, but I think that is enough to challenge you saying


I provided a source to challenge your claim, and I have tried to explain it.  So again, do you have any source to back up your claim?

The point is it protects the majority of the people who get it. Most of the rest are protected by "herd immunity", which means that even though they aren't immune, so much of the population is that the virus is t easily transmitted on a population level. It also affects babies who are not old enough to get it yet, as well as people who can't get vaccinated due to allergies. 
Also, vaccines are mostly effective, but not for everyone. So if I get vaccinated, I have (let's say) a 90% chance of being immune. If you're also 90% likely to be immune, then there's a 1% chance that someone could expose you to it and I could get it. If you don't get vaccinated, suddenly I have a 10% chance.

That's what I'm asking you, since you made the claim that that number "positively dwarfs" the number who won't vaccinate.  Now you're asking me for your source?
But here goes:  According to [this abstract]( "0.26%–0.41% of enrolled children received medical exemptions".  That's a pretty small percentage compared with the 16% in Colorado who aren't vaccinated.
So I say again, that your original claim that the number of people who can't be vaccinated "positively dwarfs" those tho won't, is completely false.

Yes.  Vaccinated people don't have 100% immunity.  The success rates vary by disease.  So maybe 90% of the people who got vaccinated are immune, but the other 10% you could spread the disease to.  
There are also people who *can't* get vaccinated, even if they wanted to: Babies and people who are allergic, for example.  Unvaccinated people can spread the disease to them, but the higher percentage of people who are vaccinated, the lower the chance that the disease spreads to those people.  This is called ["herd immunity"](

Source?  I don't think you're correct.  
[The first map on this page]( shows that 96% of North Carolina 19-35 month old children had been vaccinated.  That strongly implies that less than 4% cannot be vaccinated.  On the other hand, there's Colorado and Ohio at just 86%.  That implies that 10% of those children have failed to get the vaccine for one reason or another *other than that they can't*.  (I'm assuming relatively homogenous populations across states)

So... what? I'm a pro-vax big pharma shill?  Have a look through my history and you'll see that's not true.  I'm an active redditor who doesn't usually have much to add in but I am subscribed and like to keep up with what's going on.  
The whole post isn't really about bitcoin, it just mentions it in passing.  Are you going to call that "interesting", too?  The reply was obviously meant to be part of the post, or they would have just posted the picture.  I found what I see to be an incongruity in the post and pointed it out.  Others (apparently) found it interesting, or insightful, or that it added to the conversation and upvoted it.  
I was actually annoyed with all the anti-vax (I mean "pro-liberty") sentiment in the thread, but I've found it refreshing that there's been a high level of discourse where people seem to be asking genuine questions about vaccines when they have stuff they don't understand.

Statements like that are why we need science instead of anecdotes.  
Maybe it's true, maybe your friends happened to be a statistical anomaly.  Maybe you know 150 other people who got the the flu vaccine who *didn't* get the flu that year (and otherwise would have).  Pointing out the failures without knowing how many successes there were is meaningless.

They lost me with "unvaccinated"

I know this was a joke, but sending money to terrorist organizations is generally not seen as very funny by the government.
