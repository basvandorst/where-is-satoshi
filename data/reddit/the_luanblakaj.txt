No I can't change it... It just always takes 30%. Which does seem like a lot, because if I want to transfer 100$ worth of bitcoins I have to pay about 130$

I can't take screenshots inside the app...
It's just blank in the screenshit.
But I transferred all of my coins to that other one you recommended. So thanks ��

Thanks for the help.
The sellers recommend that I use "Bittycious"...
Has anyone ever used that, and is it trustworthy?
