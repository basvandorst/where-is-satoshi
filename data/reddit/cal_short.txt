I have over a £1k in BTC that I had just put into Cryptsy, I set a withdrawal straight away to another wallet. It's been 3 weeks and the withdrawal has not happened.
What can I do about this?

I have a ton of BTC in Cryptsy and I'm quite inactive. Where would the best place be to migrate my coins to?
EDIT: I agree that keeping these coins in exchanges isn't the safest, though, I'm rather uneducated in the Bitcoin field and have the currency simply for fun and exploration - Instead of telling me how stupid I am it'd be great to be told where I can learn more about storage.
