Although these are highly suspect sources, a coinkite/tim hortons partnership would greatly benefit both sides imho.
Tim hortons has always had a tough time dealing with transaction fees. It was only [within the last 4 years]( that you were able to pay using a debit or credit card at their stores. They were one of the longest holdouts on adopting plastic forms of payment, because every single purchase is literally a microtransaction.
How can you sell a donut for $0.70 when the banks eat up $0.25 of that revenue?
The big-wigs at Timmys very well could be dreaming of a Bitcoin-fueled future.

Hi there!
I created this website. 
It's a Hacker News clone with some Reddit functionality written in PHP.
It's branded as "A rational discussion medium focusing on Cryptocurrency, Cryptography and Privacy".
The site guidelines can be found here: 
Please post any comments or problems you notice in this thread.

Heya I figured this is a good a time as any to promote a new project I've been working on:
** - A Rational Discussion Medium Focusing on Cryptocurrency, Cryptography and Privacy**
I'm a long time lover of Bitcoin, (I [registered to bitcointalk.org over 3 years ago now]( as well as [Hacker News]( so I created a site to combine both of my loves!
The site guidelines can be found here: 
Cryptanalys.is differs from both reddit and hacker news by way of it's community control mechanisms. "Moderators" and "site admins" are anybody who's username is listed on the karma leaders page: 
Furthermore, all moderator actions are listed publicly so you can call them out when they do something you don't like: 
Let me know if you have any questions!
EDIT: For those of you who say "go pay for an advertisement!".... [I have paid for over 17 weeks of reddit server time so far!]( But unfortunately cannot get an ad placed on because gyft has a deal with reddit to buy up 100% of the available advertising space on :(

btcd is a reimplementation of the bitcoin satoshi client written in Go instead of C++.
BTCD is bitcoindark and that's what you're referring to.

Here is how 3h would read in regular english:


They also go on to say:


Somehow I think that "selling bitcoins" would be allowed by those two statements.
By "pre-approval" all they mean is you have to contact them in advance if you plan to do that, the same goes for "collecting donations as a charity or non-profit organization" so it's obviously not that big of a deal.
Perhaps not "being a bitcoin **exchange**", but "selling bitcoins" and "not buying them" expressly should be allowed according to my read through of that page.

If he bought those products "wholesale" which he very well could have at those numbers: chances are he would break even when he goes to sell them all even 6 months later through eBay. So minus electricity he is safe to mine for 6 months without losing a dime perhaps.

This. And the owners will benefit less because traders will stay away. It's a lot tougher to make a profit for a day trader at 1% that it is at 0.5%. Maybe that is their intention due to the "legal problems" presented before? Who knows!

My thoughts exactly.
I know the reference is old (the original article about US Superdollars dates to 1996), but I was surprised that I had not heard about them anywhere in the bitcoin community previously...
Considering all of the "PayPal is worse, use bitcoin!" rally charges I have seen, I have read little about the downsides of actual cash as a payment method.
Good luck counterfeiting bitcoins, Iran!

I love the fact that I can gauge when the article was written based on the numbers they provide.
6.2 million coins? Chances are they started writing this article about 6.7 difficulties or 13.4 weeks ago because there are currently 6.87 million coins and they are generated at a rate of approximately 100k/2weeks.
And I thought I was a slow writer.

I would not want to risk such a massive investment with solo mining.
Even if he has 25Ghash/s there... which I doubt... he is talking about 3.5 days on average between finding a block.
If I spent $20k ... and didn't find a block for 4 or 5 days I would start shitting bricks.

IMHO the price is dropping in anticipation of BFL shipping their ASIC orders out to customers.
A lot of the people who bought ASICs will immediately sell the majority of their coins in an effort to recoup their mining costs.
The exact same thing happened with namecoin when it was first merged mined (and received a massive influx of hashing power) about 2 years ago.

Most 100 dollar bills have traces of cocaine on (and thus illicit drug use associated with) them.
Nobody would refuse your $100 bill. Not for legality purposes at least, maybe because they are worried it's counterfeit though.

Mod from here.
In a way, mining bitcoins is actually easier on your card than using it for typical gaming.
When you use your gpu for gaming a few hours every day... it gets cool while you're not playing, and heats up while you play. This constant cooling/heating of the GPU is what eventually breaks it.
If you simply leave your mining rig mining 24/7, your gpu will last longer than expected.
And no, 64c is not too hot at all. I've had mine upwards of 80c for extended periods of time with no problems.

I'm assuming the ~1,100 bitcoin volume on my 1 hour market watch screen represents ~550 bitcoins sold ($190 * 550 = $104,500) and ~550 bitcoins re-purchased at a bargain.

[I am responding to Stephen Gornick's post here about Bitcoin being a **"very expensive network to maintain compared to a centralized system with a single 'master node' / authoritative source."**]( with some simple math:
I know that I can rent a dedicated 1Gbps line for ~$1,000/month (and that's being generous). A 1Gbps line means you have the capability to download (and upload) exactly 125 Megabytes of data every second continuously, forever, until your contract runs out. That means that in a month's time, you could download ~302 million MegaBytes of data, or 295,312 GigaBytes of data. (That number comes assuming we are using the month of February, in a leap year... 125 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 28=302,400,000MB)
Basically what this means is that the wholesale price of a GigaByte of data is approximately $1,000 divided by 295,312GB which equals $0.0033862491195752/GB of download bandwidth. (You're sure getting ripped off on international text message charges!)
A GigaByte is a lot of space. We thankfully only need about 250 Bytes of transaction data or less to process a typical transaction, according ot the [Bitcoin wiki.](
So how many multiples of 250 Bytes fit into 1GB are you asking? Great question!
1024 (MB in a GB) * 1024 (KB in a MB) * 1024 (B in a KB) / 250 (B in average transaction) = 4,294,967.296 average transactions can be downloaded in 1 GigaByte of bandwidth.
Now if we divide the number of transactions that can fit in a GigaByte of bandwidth by the cost of a typical GigaByte of wholesale bandwidth ($0.0033862491195752/GB / 4294967.296/GB = $0.0000000007884225620830432 or $7.884225620830432e-10) that gives us a price of $0.0000000007884225620830432 per transaction per node.
Now, Stephen Gornick claimed 10s of thousands of nodes... lets say there are 100k actively running the bitcoin client just to be sure.
**That places the average wholesale cost of a bitcoin transaction (in bandwidth, broadcast to the entire network) at around: $0.0000000007884225620830432 * 100,000 = $0.00007884225620830432 USD.**
Now, don't even get me started about amortizing the cost of the hard drive reads and writes...
Oh, and by the way... bandwidth only going to get cheaper: 
EDIT: grammar.
