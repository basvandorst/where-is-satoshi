Hi Jesse, thanks for the AMA. What should ex-Coinsetter engineers that have Coinsetter stock certificates expect from the acquisition? Who should they contact for more information?

OkCoin USD is also having the same problem. They also use the same bank in Taiwan - KGI Bank.

I have SegWit running my Core GUI. Yes, you need to use the Console window command to generate a Segwit address: "addwitnessaddress &lt;addr&gt;" - was very easy to do.

Yes, finally someone agrees that they'll probably allow btc at some point. I think 10% they'll start with btc, 40% with apple, and 50% with both. Maybe they may even strike a deal with CoinBase and CoinLab, or vice versa.

Well I figure the QE money is already in the supply - can't just take them out.

I don't know if I read that right, but can they really get a patent on virtual currency? I mean that shit existed in the early 2000s... I think they're jus patenting the digital wallet and the NSA service. I.e., they can't just accuse Bitcoin of breaking patent laws since it is already prior art, right? Someone please confirm.
