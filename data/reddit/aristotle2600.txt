I think the English equivalent of the word you are using is "sinusoid."

Wow, that was an incredible answer, and a great contribution to my personal quest to understand economics on my own terms!  I need to digest and reread it, but for now:
* It was heavily implied by your answer, but I don't want to get it wrong....if everyone, governments, banks, companies, individuals, just decided to pay all their debts tomorrow, and we had some giant database to coordinate the traffic-jam-like problem of having no currency to pay your debt, what would happen?  I *think* that somehow the US Mint (well, all government mints) would end up with all the currency in the world.  Is that right?  That sounds like the consequence of the "all money is debt" adage, but it also seems pretty absurd.
* Is there anything inherently wrong with the government just printing money to pay government workers, buy government-needed goods and services, etc.?  In this system, the government tries to match tax receipts to expenditures, but if it can't / it's judged a bad idea, then that's basically the same as the current "going into debt," but it's more straightforward.  There's also nothing inherently preventing the government from issuing bonds.  Actually, I feel like my idea actually is better than the current system, because it separates taxing/spending and the bond market, which should allow for better control of both.  Am I on to something or the worst kind of misguided? :)

I have a few questions.
* "All money is debt" is usually a phrase I hear attached to fringe/Ron Paul types, are they actually right, or are you saying something subtly different?
* If money is identical to debt, does that mean that if everyone and the government paid off all debt, money would somehow disappear?
* An idea that has been bouncing around in my head.  The process of creating new money, with the Mint printing, then selling to the Fed which then does its thing, seems baroque.  Why can't government just print money to pay for deficits?  The very idea of us being able to "run out of money," and our treasury having a balance (at what bank, exactly?) seems dumb.
