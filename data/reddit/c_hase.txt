People paying the high fees of Coinbase pay for the free fees of Gdax.

If you memorize your keys doesn't that mean the government can't ask you for it? If you write it down they can though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:36:42
Coinomi*, it supports a lot of coins so if people want to give you random shitcoins for some reason, they probably have it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:22:34
Use [this faucet]( to get familiar with Bitcoin, and then invest your own money when your confident enough.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:28:14
I've been doing it for a few months. But even then this is the only one that doesn't have the scammy cash out limit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:26:09
Did I say it was a lot?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:50:14
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:15:16
Sending it is just like the other person buying it for zero. So no taxes I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:16:04
Got like 50 Bitcoin because a guy failed to do a parkour jump on a Minecraft server. Gave it to my friend and he lost it all betting on a pig race.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:00:14
It will buy when it gets to a lower price you specify, but if it never gets that low then you never buy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:17:41
Dips haven't really been better than DCA
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:26:36
You can earn a buck or two a month with [this faucet]( Showed my mother how thew few dollars I made turned into tens of dollars as the price increased and she actually wanted me to invest more of my own money!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:23:50
Try [a faucet like this one]( they give it out for free to get people started!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:39
Yes sometimes it pays to pay the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:46:59
You can set your fees in coinomi
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:49:30
Verify your identity on coinbase instead. It worked first time after trying gdax two days in a row and failing. And once you verify on coinbase they let you into gdax too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:29:51
Dollar cost average, basically the first two you proposed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:45:44
Well the amount they give out scales with the btc price so I've been doing it for many months now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:23:33
Coinomi was good for me before I got a hardware wallet. Although their PR was atrocious when someone found out it was broadcasting your public addresses somewhere, but its good just to keep a few dollars on.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:06:30
It's technically a separate wallet but you transfer between instantly and free.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:40
If you buy the Bitcoin itself the price locks in, if you just deposit USD into the USD account it will not lock in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:39:12
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:51:16
Use [a faucet]( to earn a little and get comfortable with it. Then invest your own money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:25:59
I use [this one]( and I made 130,000 satoshi so far. Still not even close to one but it's something!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:51:18
You can't sell the coin if your in Canada with Coinbase I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:34:05
Life changing gains are probably not going to happen anymore but who knows maybe it will go into the millions. But you can still invest to earn some.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:27:02
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:25
That's strange, I know for sure Coinomi does it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:16
Get a Ledger Nano S, give someone trustworthy (like your parents) your 24 words.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:18:48
They are only not allowed in a submission but nice try.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:21
It will take time to confirm so at that point the price will change. Don't hold in an exchange though, get a hardware or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:09:46
Well transferring to GDAX from Coinbase is free because they are the same company. GDAX pays the miner fee when withdrawing though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:28
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:23
I'm glad you like it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:13:00
Transfer like 100 to Coinbase, when that comes through, buy with GDAX and initiate another transfer with Coinbase, repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:41:04
You could do it with internet off, and maybe safe mode? Not sure about the ladder.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:47:50
Are you sure your own puzzles are solvable through the video, one of the numbers is too blurry to read on the highest quality.

Below the chart you'll see the graph for the buy and sell orders. If your screen is too small it won't show up.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:38:24
Yes [this]( is the only one worth while. Made 144,000 Satoshi so far.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:28:50
I use Bitcoin Chart Widget
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:35:57
Here's [an app]( to get started with a little for free.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:20:22
I'll actually give you a real answer instead of these trolls. There is a [faucet I use]( that can earn you some pocket change. Not near the amount you want, but it's something.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:41:39
Get verified on coinbase instead. They have more questions which makes it more forgiving. It's actually kind of creepy and will ask you to check off names of people you know in real life.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:03:12
It's just coinbase taking a long time to notice that it's confirmed. That's why you should use a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:10:33
No one can hear you so Ill just give my own suggestion, use [this faucet](
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:32:06
They are called faucets. The idea is you watch ads and the creator gives you part of their revenue in Bitcoin. Some are scams by having INSANE cash out limits where you'll either forget about the app or never be able to cash out. I can't vouch for any others except [this one]( the cash out limit is not an insane amount, it's actually time based, 3 days. You can also cash out as many Satoshi as you want because it uses Coinbase so there's no fees getting your Satoshi. I hope this helped.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:19:42
Just a period where were waiting for something to happen to affect the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:44:20
In theory it's true, but there's many farms that run off green energy because now you don't have to spend some of the money you earn on power.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:31
Your energy refills passively 1 a second.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:48:01
If some miners find it is unprofitable to mine, they will stop and the difficulty will decrease for the other miners, using less power. So it just balances out.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:33:48
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:51:21
No you just have to sign in with the email you use for coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:53
It doesn't have to function. You could store your coins with it and then throw it in the trash and they will still be safe. Your 24 word seed is all that matters.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:41:30
It's good to diversify. Read up on what the coins achieve and invest if you believe in their technology.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:57:26
A hardware or paper wallet is the most safe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:36
Verify everything on coinbase instead.

[This app]( was created for that exact reason, see the description. The developer doesn't make much money he told me. Gives it away mostly to get people started.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:10:30
If you scan the private key with coinbase it should give you an option to sweep. Most wallets do it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:44:08
If the btc isn't in your account then it was phishing email.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:53:09
Oh you mean to just [use a faucet?](
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:27:09
Replied to the wrong comment but sure you saw it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:28:17
Because we are waiting to see what lighting network does to help. Edit: didn't reply to the right comment I hate this app
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:03:01
Well yeah it's the most popular and made for newbies.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:19:35
[Speak for yourself.](
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:29
Most people say GDAX is the "true" price. A lot of people don't celebrate ATH until it hits that price on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:14:25
We use the lightning Network
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:25:53
You can cash out just 1 Satoshi if you wanted to. There's no limit, only a cooldown instead (3 days between cash outs) I've cashed out over 140,000 Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:50:40
Definitely [this faucet]( It's the best I've seen and the developer is so kind.
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:57:17
Check my profile. There are some pretty good faucet apps. Pay really well and none of that scammy cash out minimum.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:25:08
Edit: so like 1 btc is 40.4m gold?
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:15:26
It will still work as long as some have electricity/internet though right? 
There's a bigger problem than the Bitcoin network going down if literally everyone in the world looses electricity.
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:52:20
Time to uninstall. Oh wait I never installed it anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:40:53
I really suggest [this faucet]( the developer is super nice and told me he doesnt make much off the app and gives most of it away to help people get started with crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:16
The only wall they will WANT to pay for!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:04:34
If you don't have free power you will be loosing money. Buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:50:28
You can use [this faucet]( in the meantime. Can easily make a few dollars, and who knows what price they will be when you're allowed to invest your own money!
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:41:05
If you don't own your keys you don't own your Bitcoin. You will have to trust them to let you split. But trust no one.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:12:40
I think they can give you the money back. Contact them, but it might take some time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:58:53
Get a Nano S very quick they are on Cyber Monday sale for 21% off on the official website.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:13:40
It's known not to trust what they estimate. And don't worry all of mines been like this as well, but the eventually come in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:53
0, they pay for it themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:43:57
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:27:19
Paper wallet if your a cheapskate. But you could possibly loose it since it's quite literally a piece of paper.
Hardware wallet for ultimate security.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:01:06
They will go to these people, see if they paid taxes on their earnings, if not, probably give them a friendly reminder at first.
If Coinbase won, and didn't have to give the details out, then the IRS would go for cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:45:30
If you mean a faucet, there's one I use that's actually pretty good.  There is no withdrawal limit, Instead the withdrawal limit is just a 3 day cooldown. Pocket change, but it's more than many others!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:05
Coinbase and GDAX (wish gdax had an app) to buy bitcoin.
Delta to view how much my bitcoin in my hardware wallet is worth.
Coinomi to accept random peoples shitcoins.
Bitcoin Chart Widget for a price widget on my home screen.
Bitfortip to make some bitcoin answering questions (rarely)
[Free Bitcoin Spinner]( to make some pocket change.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:06
Deposit USD into Coinbase for free
Transfer that USD into GDAX for free
Place a limit order to buy bitcoin with that USD for free
Keep it there, or on coinbase as long as you don't mind suddenly loosing it all one day (due to anything can happen since its online) or buy a hardware wallet and withdraw to that for free. (on GDAX)
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:34:44
I expected two peanuts and you eating the one on the left.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:49
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:11:08
Coinbase is good until you figure out if you're going to get more into it. Then invest in hardware wallet. Etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:32
Right now!
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:27:39
 0.0000000385 dollars I think?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:58
You will loose money if you don't have free power, just buy bitcoin right now @ the dip with the money you would have paid for the 1080. Hodl, and you will make more money, faster
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:08:50
If you don't own your keys you don't own your btc. Never used their wallet but if you do get to know your keys that is great, but they know your keys also which means anything can happen with your btc. Invest in a hardware wallet if you want to continue to invest in Bitcoin. Or a simple paper wallet can do. Just don't loose it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:05
Deposit money into Coinbase for free.
Transfer money to GDAX for free.
Place a limit order and buy bitcoin with no fee.
Send BTC to the wallet for free.
Total fees: $0!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:38
How will it use any cpu when chrome hogs all of it already?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:46:16
What wallet application are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:05:50
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:28
Then you will have to research how much money you'll be making and how much time it will take to pay off the 1080. If you are not a big mining corporation you wont be making anything for a loooong time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:16
Ledger looks prettier.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:02:31
It shows you 24 words you can write down and use to recover your private key from another device.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:55:17
Both Coinbase and Ledger said you will be able to split the coins. So either keep it in Coinbase (easier) or send it to your Nano (safer)
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:17:05
TBH I believe that segwit is literally only benefits.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:52:10
It means they will get people to obey the law and not see crypto as a way to escape taxes and then get it banned.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:09
Get some satoshis for watching an ad, its the most profitable one I've seen, creator told me he gives away most of the profit, so that's probably why.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:57:10
Coinbase is real easy if you don't mind fees. Use their other website GDAX if you don't want fees, but more advanced.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:24
If it weren't for you meddling gravity!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:11
Yes you should try to change it, the rate which you changes it is up to you. But if something ever happens to the business, people will know EXACTLY how much to charge. (If you don't change it out.)
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:44:25
Depends where you got it from, that could be you or someone else's address.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:07
Sometimes you just gotta take the hit and buy it with the fee instead of through gdax
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:46:38
 This is better.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:01:24
They charge a dollar every month so meh. Also uses Coinbase so RIP half your money from fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:24
It happens every single time, it will get back up their eventually. It is known as corrections. People love to see bitcoin break new records, but it is never really worth that much (at the time) so it goes back down later to what it is really is worth, and grows back at a later time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:06
Depends which wallet you use, but if you don't own your private key, You don't own your Bitcoin. Even if your web wallet shows you your private key, technically they own your Bitcoin too and your private key is exposed to any hacks that can happen in the future. With a hardware wallet you and only you knows the private key.
Coinbase especially, you don't know your private key because it doesn't even exist. Bitcoin on coinbase is a "I owe you" note from them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:36
Use [this faucet app](
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:58:47
The 24 words can be converted to your private key.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:38
Impossible to know, but a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:34:25
No, It does all the stuff dealing with your private key inside the device, instead of somewhere else, like a phone, or pc, where something could be created to snoop on the data and steal your key.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:19
Heard people talking about bitcoin.tax, haven't used it yet. Probably wont in a long time. But it looks good!
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:39:42
I am not sure exactly but I think miners also take into account how old the transaction is. So if it's super old since no one has mined it, it would eventually get mined.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:07
Yeah sadly, maybe poke them on [twitter]( and show your interest!
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:25:38
Yes having your own wallet is better than someone else having your wallet. I doubt anything will happen to blockchain.info but if there's a way to be safer you should do it. And that's with a hardware or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:58:21
Bots seeing which way it's trending.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:14
But are your pennies, satoshis? Both our points are proven. I understand its not much, but cant hate on free though..
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:00:57
No sell. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:07
You will always have your 24 words to recover your private key. Also paper is easier to loose than a flash drive sized device you payed money for.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:42:50
What are taxes
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:45:49
 This app has earned me over 100,000 Satoshi. Probably one of the best. If you want to earn more you can check out other faucets.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:08:59
That's just how it goes. It's ridiculously slow. This is why we need Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:56:14
You can use [this faucet]( to gain a little bit of Bitcoin for free. I've used it for a while and have 12 dollars worth now!
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:31:27
To be legal in the US.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:19:04
Free if you move it to GDAX and then send it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:18:45
Used [this faucet]( and watched how fast the pocket change increased in price, then decided to invest in a more substantial amount of my own money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:04:58
Yep exactly!
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:39:13
As many as you like, theres no minimum, so you can cash out 1 satoshi if you so choose. The limit is just 3 days between instead.
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:53:03
There's no more like loop to put it on keychains or anything though? We just going to stuff it in our pockets?
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:37:42
There's a really good mobile faucet called Free Bitcoin Spinner, you can find the link through my profile if you'd like.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:07:34
Don't use any at the moment, I believe coinflash is the only one working right now but it has 1 dollar a month fee. Dustapp is really pretty tho, Hoard has some weird ICO, cryptonapp doesn't look the prettiest.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:01:41
For me it was because Trezor is ugly lol
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:23:30
Nice try Coinbase corporate!
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:12:14
I wish everything started using that website, don't they even have a freaking api? Why does no wallet use it??
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:54:36
Dustapp, Cryptonapp, Hoard, Coinflash
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:28:08
Thought you would be payed to send your thoughts on advertised messages but I believe it's just to spam anyone who emails you and force them to pay to get a reply.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:44:22
How fun. I really love hoodies!
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:47:25
You just have to find the good faucets. There's one I use that you can make 30 cents to a dollar every few days in Bitcoin. Still pocket change but it's much better than the others.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:42:53
What payment method does it use behind the scenes? Gift card?
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:20:41
Their app deals are gooood
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:48:38
I think it is illegal only if you attempt to change it's value or change it so much it cannot be used.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:23:52
I think it's still beneficial to have an account. But just like you don't keep all your money under your bed, don't keep all of your money in coinbase.
