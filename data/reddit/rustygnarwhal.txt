Same thing happened to me once.  I called and they told me there's nothing to they can do.  SOL, unfortunately.

Honestly, no one knows for sure what will happen.  A good compromise would be to buy some now and some after.
Or if you're completely uninformed about the fork, then waiting until after is a completely valid strategy.

I'd say that that's a smart strategy considering you have almost no understanding to what is happening.
Nothing wrong with sitting this one out until you're comfortable with making a decision with any amount of $$ whether it's $100 or $10,000

when you have your coins on an exchange you don't truly own them.  Anything can happen to an exchange, bankrupt, site goes down, etc.
Get a private wallet where you control the private keys.  Be safe.
