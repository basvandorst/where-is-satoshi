Well formulated. Couldn't have said it better :)

Good observation! Well yes, the growth is indeed slowing down. If it wouldn't, then BTC price would grow linearly on the logarithmic Chart. But it is more like a squareroot function, so it will continue to Just grow slower. But since Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, it grows exponentially at First. Then slows down an reaches a saturation Point. I think that saturation Point is at 1 Million in 2030-2035. That's where the longterm growth is pointing towards. Don't forget: A 20k price was pure SCI Fi Back in 2014-2015.

As Bitcoin grows, the Volatility will get lower and lower. The bubble Tops will be less and less extreme, until when BTC has reached saturation, the Volatility will almost Zero. So then it will be really viable for Mass Adoption.

Thanks :) Yes, some unforeseen events could of course disrupt the Chart. The Chart basically represents a high likelihood scenario, but certainly not 100%. With Bitcoin it's always about probable and improbable scenarios. But I wouldn't dare to say this or that is going to happen with 100% probability. There is Always a 10% Chance that some totally weird and unforeseen stuff will Happen, hehe!

It's a good thing to be criticised I think. Constructive criticism is very useful, and could help improving.
I agree that Charting in General and technical analysis are Kind of self fulfilling prophecies. If enough people believe that TA works, it will work. If no one believes it will work, then it won't work. These charts are not to be seen as "this is gonna Happen with 100% probability exactly Like this" .
I tend to see TA as a useful tool in order to be able to get a feeling for the most likely scenario. I think btc will always Work Better than other assets TA wise because of it's decentral nature. It is harder to be influenced Like a Stock or a Fiat currency, which completely depend on a company or State, respectively. The best TA is useless with a Stock, if the CEO of the company messes Up and bankrupts the company. I therefore think that Bitcoin is more robust and TA will always Work Better.

That's at least what I will do. It's a good risk/reward ratio I'd say. Certainly better than playing lottery, hehe. Sure, it's not 100% sure that it will go to 100k, but I think the likelihood is high. Remember, 20k seemed impossible back in 2014/15, when we were at 200-300 USD.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:48:35
Indeed. Well, if we take the historical inflation of the dollar, probably 1 mill USD in 2030 will be what today is 300-400k.   
Except we get some crazy unforeseen hyper inflation event, but I think that is unlikely.

Yes, another good analogy :) 
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:27:51
Thanks :) yeah, you're right. It could continue to creep even Higher in 2030+, but maybe much slower as nowadays.
It will be interesting to witness.

Thanks, I'll try my best :) I find BTCs price growth dynamic fascinating. If this model would hold, it would be amazing for predicting the future price development :)
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:39:44
Excellent analogy! Then let's Hope that BTC also contains a Lot of dark Energy, at least 80%, so that BTC also will start to accelerate its expansion XD
Then there's also the Kind of crazy but fascinating theory of eternal Inflation. Inflation basically never ending. Also good if translated to Bitcoin, hehe!

It could be, also a valid theory :) I am a physicist and tend to see bitcoin more like a physical system, so that, the more mass it accumulates, the more momentum it has, and the more sluggish it becomes. But your Point of View is also valid. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:29:19
Could be, yes. The top of the new ATH varies a Lot, could be your date, or as late as 2024 in an extreme Case. We'll see :)
