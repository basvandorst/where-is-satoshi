And absolutely none of that necessitates a high price-per-unit (satoshi, bitcoin, whatever). Again, that's the joke. 
He isn't trying to say you can build smart contracts on a cheque. He's making a simple analogy which seems to be too hard for you to understand. Also smart contracts are cool and all but also legally worthless. The blockchain has no legal relevance. Bitcoin isn't going to get rid of lawyers and notaries and accountants.

Exactly what? Interact without a third party? Then go on and buy something from Dell or Newegg without Coinbase or BitPay. You can't.


Right. This isn't a good thing. 


This doesn't make sense at all, made even funnier by the "genius" part you added at the end in some idiotic attempt to be witty. 
**There is no need for third parties to accept Bitcoin**. Dell could make a wallet and you could send them BTC directly. Same with Newegg. Coinbase and BitPay don't need to exist but to take a cut from a transaction wherein nobody is supposed to be getting a cut. 
If I really need to dumb this down for you, Bitcoin was literally created to cut out companies like Visa and Mastercard and Paypal but hilariously has embraced third party companies like BitPay that actually facilitate the economy


This is so vague and general. Again, I'll remind you bitcoin was **literally created to exist with no third party as a trustless payment mechanism**


No,  it doesn't. Bitcoin will be regulated like any other commodity or currency in the coming months and years, and the same "evil" will be "enforced" by your new government and banks, aka Coinbase and BitPay and every other third party that Bitcoin relies on for use and, essentially, survival.

This is all you really need to know. 
Also this seems somewhat relevant:


There are so few Bitcoin-based businesses in NY that the Job Impact Statement isn't necessary, but even if there was an impact - 


They really don't care if these regulations are going to make it tough for startups, the idea is that if you're going to be a startup in the financial industry you should be able to handle basic regulations and if you can't then you shouldn't be in business in the first place. 
I agree that it's a bit contradictory, but their entire job is to prevent money laundering. They won't back down on regulations just because it makes life a little harder for small businesses. Think of credit unions, they have to deal with the same regulations that big banks do and it doesn't stop them from operating, nor do they complain about it as much as people here are complaining about basic AML regulations

I never claimed selling drugs and money laundering are one in the same. I'm saying if you're trading your illegal goods for legal goods with the obvious future intentions of selling those legal goods for cash you're conspiring to commit money laundering. 
I still have doubts that you're an actual lawyer because, as the judge pointed out, the grounds for money laundering are a lot less strict than you're implying they are. You're implying I can sell cocaine in trade for property forever and will only have committed the crime of selling cocaine so long as I never sell the property I obtained. The intent to launder the drug money is very obviously there whether the legal goods you obtained in exchange are ever actually converted to USD or not, they still have a real USD value and you're unlikely to be able to prove to a court that you never had intentions of selling the legal goods you obtained.

Reflecting back on this, it's truly ridiculous. It's so utterly irrelevant whether you can write messages with Bitcoin. You can use a one dollar bill as a post-it note. You can use a one dollar bill as fire kindling, that doesn't change the primary use of a dollar bill and is an utterly idiotic argument to suggest that the primary reason for Bitcoin's existence (and in fact the vast and overwhelming majority of its use today) isn't finance.

I'm not sure but maybe an essentially-random 21M units isn't a good idea, or maybe the reward schedule should have been considered a bit more carefully. 


The only explanation I should need to give you is that Paypal and WU don't need to deal with any of the convoluted nonsense you followed this statement with. WU makes millions upon millions in profit, if bitcoin was competitive they could easily lower their fees. 
Difficulty drops don't happen overnight. 


Fiat remittance companies are making bank. That's it. You don't seem to understand it's not an inherent cost of transferring money, they can already do it much cheaper. 


And you are making assumptions about other people's situations. I'm not paying for more than I think because my banking is absolutely free and so are all of my transactions considering legacy banking doesn't impose all transaction fees upon the consumers.

I'm sorry, but people here talk everyday about merchants abandoning credit cards for Bitcoin. I understand the difference but the fact is that many people here (certainly the majority) believe Bitcoin to be a competitive service. It doesn't matter if Visa doesn't issue VisaCoins or whatever, what matters is that they are a modern payment processor offering modern consumer amenities (chargebacks) and Bitcoin is trying to be competitive while not offering modern services. 
Seriously, your analogy was terrible. It's like a car produced in the 80's trying to compete with the fuel efficiency of today's cars. It doesn't matter how old you are, it matters what you offer. We're in the age of iPhones and Bitcoin is still a flip phone.

They may not be able to shut it down but they certainly have the power to regulate it, enforce penalties on people that break those regulations or outlaw it entirely.

My pleasure


Your **total liability limit** with Coinbase is 3 months worth of service fees. That is an absolute and irrefutable fact. Maybe benevolent 'ole Coinbase will in fact reimburse customers for 100% of losses but my point is (and has always been) they have no actual legal obligation to fully reimburse customers for any *damages*. You're sorely mistaken if you believe Coinbase, Circle or Xapo are in any way obligated to reimburse customers for 100% of any insured losses (because, again, you're the end user, not an insured client). 
As for your claim that any company doing such shady business wouldn't be in business for long - see my example wWal-Mart taking out life insurance policies listing themselves as the beneficiary. Somehow Walmart isn't totally out of business contrary to your beliefs. 


You keep saying this but ignore my requests that you back up your claim with any sort of evidence


No. Black-and-white English in their ToS indicates they have absolutely **NO LIABILITY** to end users, creditors, customers, whatever beyond 3 months worth of fees. They aren't a bank or vault or liable storage, they are simply holding your bitcoins with little actual responsibility in case of loss. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 00:10:41
Having somebody "handle your money flows" isn't the same thing as immediately selling a commodity. It's essentially saying "we don't want this". If you need an explanation as to why that's not "good for Bitcoin" you might need to go back to school

Right, it depends on them being a libertarian like Overstock's Patrick Byrne. I don't see why some mystery supplier would begin accepting BTC without also converting. If their customer (the merchant) isn't taking that risk why should they? If the merchant doesn't hold any BTC they won't have any to pay the supplier with anyway.

No, it provides no incentive because I can already easily shop directly with my credit card or with PayPal. I have zero incentive to buy bitcoins, and don't care about saving merchants processing fees that they aren't going to pass on anyway. 


Coinbase published statistics, something like 80% convert some BTC to fiat and ~50% convert it all to fiat. FYI the absolute biggest most important merchants all convert 100%. Overstock held 10% as BTC and lost half of that money this year, do I need to explain to you why that isn't an attractive option for other merchants?

I think it's reprehensible that Walmart should literally profit from the death of an entry-level employee while said employee likely can't afford the life insurance you're talking about and who's family was not made aware that Walmart had issued a policy. 
I think it's bizarre that as long as something is done for tax reasons you seem to be okay with it. "key man" insurance wouldn't be particularly immoral because they are somehow limited by the absence of that person and such an important figure also likely earns enough to support their family (perhaps even obtain life insurance) whereas Walmart profits from the death of entry-level clerks that are replaced before they are buried in the ground and are in no serious way harmed by the loss of that employee. "Dead Peasants" is a pretty fitting description in contrast to your "key man" insurance, don't you think? 
I understand the beep-boop I am a business robot reason behind doing so, but yes I think it's immoral to profit off the death of an employee who was unaware of the policy, who's family was unaware of the policy, and who's family does not benefit in any way from the policy. Beyond the cost of replacing the lost employee I don't see any reason why a company should profit off of the death of an employee, and honestly don't see how anybody couldn't recognize that profit as immoral money.

Again, nobody cares about number of transactions if the actual volume, in dollars, of the economy isn't growing. Your chart only shows that more transactions are happening, mine shows that the same amount of money is changing hands. That's not a good thing. 
I'm not saying it's happening, but two guys could exchange satoshis with each other back and forth all day, doing a million transactions a year. The next year they do it even faster and there's two million transactions. Sounds like great growth right? You're ignoring the whole rest of the economy which overall isn't growing in size (measured in USD). 
You would expect every year the actual amount of money being transferred to be a lot bigger, not almost the same. More transactions might be happening, but they're smaller basically insignificant transactions if they aren't actually increasing the amount of value going around.

You didn't think through your post very well. People don't use stocks, bonds, oil or gold to make everyday purchases. Currencies aren't meant to be hoarded, they are meant to be used. If Bitcoin was purely an investment vehicle I might be inclined to agree with you, however Overstock, Newegg and many other retailers are counting on users to actually spend their BTC, not simply hold on to them for years until they hopefully become worth more. 
In case you're totally oblivious somehow, dollars are inflationary, which encourages spending and investment (not hoarding, big big difference)

To even think it's possible for Bitcoin to grow from $500 now at the end of August to $10,000 by the end of the year, 20x growth, is beyond naive. It's just baseless, ridiculous wishful thinking. Dream on crazy buddy.

Okay, cool, so you're just sticking your fingers in your ears and denying reality at this point then? 
It's like you understand the concept but in a childish way are being willfully ignorant. I can't buy anything with my points in Super Mario World, Bitcoins are not even close to the same thing as points in a video game. Now that Bitcoins are all grown up and being used more for commerce they **are** going to be subject to regulations. You can pretend they are immune or argue it's morally wrong but that is what's happening. An unchecked monetary transfer system is money laundering heaven and there's a heavy need for regulations. 
Sorry to break it to you but the regulations are coming and Bitcoin is absolutely going to be susceptible to them. It's like you've created this fantasy in your head where Lawsky has been proposing regulations for months and you think he's going to sit down at his desk one day and somehow realize he doesn't have the power. All because r/bitcoin mod jratcliff doens't want it to be so. 
Let me make some equally absurd statements to hopefully illustrate my point - 
They can't arrest me for holding cocaine! It's just a white chemical powder! 
They can't force me to pay tickets! They're just arbitrary pieces of paper!

@_date: 2014-11-29 20:11:39
Isn't the whole point of bitcoin non-reversible transactions with no chargebacks? When you pay with Bitcoin you make damn sure you're dealing with a reputable vendor and have read the Terms and Conds and have done your duty as a customer before irrevocably spending your bitcoins because that's what this libertarian paradise is for after all, isn't it?

because I caution that a 1% rise over an afternoon does not mean you get to call the beginning of a bull market and anyone half-informed on the state of bitcoin over the past several months would know that but instead what's the first response I get?


From one of the regular batshit lunatic bitcoiners who genuinely think I'm paid by the banks to speak ill of poor-old bitcoin though the reality is this sub is filled with sad losers like yourself desperate to make a winfall sitting behind your computer and so when the price rises $5 after dropping $120 you call it the beginning of something big. 
I've been posting here for fairly close to a year now and seeing the exact same posts as yours for months on end. $700 is a cheap deal! We won't be below $600 for long! This jump from the $200's is the beginning of $10,000 bitcoins guys! Now throw your thread on the heap.

"Not really if" indeed. What "if" not? You're talking about 20 billion transactions a year when right now the network averages about 1 transaction per second. We're at roughly 31M transactions per year now, a figure which unfortunately hasn't grown much in the last year if you look at transaction volume charts. 
So, yes, hopefully the bitcoin network manages to greatly increase the number of transactions, *otherwise* miners are going to require pretty substantial tx fees in order to pay the electricity bills. "If" the network continues to stagnate in terms of growth then we're going to have a serious problem in 10 or so years. 
So, uhh, "not really" to your not really.

This stands true, though you can't really spend Bitcoins anywhere without relying on Coinbase or BitPay


Bitcoin is regulated
Bitcoin is (obviously) not manipulation-free. There's a reason the price was $1100 last year and the reason is a bot that manipulated the market to create the illusion of demand.

While this is true, it's a bit besides the point. MtGox wouldn't have been insured because Bitcoins are prohibitively expensive to actually insure. 


Yeah, this or you get a worthless $100 insurance policy and advertise to gullible people that your bitcoins are "insured!", referring them to the ToS they obviously never read when a problem actually arises. 
If you wanted actual Bitcoin insurance it would probably cost $100+ per month, if not more, and would probably require a company holding your private keys anyway. No insurance company can reasonably absorb the loss of thousands of bitcoins without collecting *substantial* fees. No bitcoin company will offer anything remotely resembling "actual" insurance for free.

Uhh, sure it is. You know the bitcoin economy is nowhere near the market cap right? Bitcoins don't *need* to cost $500 right now, the bitcoin economy would likely still be able to function if all existing BTC were valued at $10. There simply isn't much of an active economy yet. 
I fail to see what relevance the number of "bucks" has here. The USD is a bustling economy used by millions upon millions of people for mostly every transaction in their life. Bitcoin, to date, is a niche payment tool with roughly or less than 1 million users and almost no transactional volume growth in the past year

Draper is down several million. Clearly this is going to go on forever and we can call bitcoin a winner because people keep throwing money at it!
Seems like the most successful bitcoin business is a company that sells your bitcoins or otherwise exchanges them for cash and then pays a vendor in fiat. That's a company that Bitcoin was never supposed to need and a company that Bitcoin may never escape from, which is a major point of centralization and another one of the things Bitcoin was aimed to avoid.

Losing half of your money isn't that drastic? If your boss told you your paycheque was going to be cut in half next week, and then again next year, would you be as relaxed about the schedule? 
Millions upon millions of dollars spent on equipment for mining bitcoins will become immensely less profitable while difficulty continues to rise amid the bitcoin gold rush. This means you'll be paying higher transaction fees every time the price halves assuming the actual value of bitcoin and volume of the network grows at an incredible pace, much faster than what we're experiencing now. "More rewarding tx fees" is a gigantic problem when low transaction fees are the entire value of your network at that point

Why not 7 million? Why not 82 million? The point is the number of units provided, the reward schedule, isn't planned out that well. If the value of bitcoin doesn't rise dramatically within that 20 years, which is a possibility, then the block reward becomes meaningless fairly soon and the network is dependent on transaction fees, which could be astronomical or transactions could just take forever to process, which is terribly uncompetitive. 


So...these multi-billion dollar corporations won't recognize the threat until the last minute and somehow bitcoin will, according to you, definitely be able to undercut their established multi-billion dollar networks? I'm telling you the debit networks in Canada cost 6 cents per transaction, Visa or Mastercard or Paypal could likely afford the same and would certainly do so before simply allowing Bitcoin to eat their lunch. 
Sorry dude but your whole reasoning there is vague and illogical

The internet is and always was an immensely useful tool for communicating and working.

Disagree with this. I agree it's fairly immoral (maybe not the right word but close enough) to do so, but as you agreed its well within their legal rights according to the ToS customers agree to by using their services. They'll stay in business just fine because they won't be sued for their actions and most people don't even bother to read the ToS for sites they use. People will certainly complain about the insufficient reimbursement, but that complaining isn't going to put Coinbase out of business. I don't suspect losses will occur frequently enough (or in sufficient volume) for this to really be a PR problem as you're suggesting. A few people will find out the hard way how useless the insurance actually is and then everybody else will just understand the truth of the matter as a result. 


Wal-Mart takes life insurance policies out on employees, lists themselves as the beneficiary, and doesn't pay shit to families of the deceased, it's not totally without precedent and actually is only smart business to cover your losses but also retain as much money as possible within the law. 
You're right, that's exactly what I'm accusing Coinbase of because that's exactly what they're entitled to do according to their ToS. If they were so generous as to completely reimburse users for losses they could explain as much in their ToS.

I don't think I've said anything about the "maximum said coverages will reimburse in the case of a loss". If you've been paying attention its very clear that Coinbase will receive reimbursements. The part you're apparently having trouble understanding is that Coinbase is in no way obligated to repay users more than 3 months worth of fees. 
Geez dude, you really do have reading comprehension problems don't you? Again, not a single thing I said was "wrong" but I think it's hilarious you're childish enough to respond to over a dozen posts with your childish meme bullshit and then are unable to even quote me saying anything wrong. Coinbase is the insured, not the end users. It's not that hard to understand, unless you're a teenage braindead retard like you apparently are. Read the conversation over a few times and maybe you can grasp some understanding. The attorney agreed with everything I said, the only discrepancy is that he believes Coinbase will pay users more than they actually limited their liability and I think they may not. 
Not ever going to respond to you again because you're such an immature little baby. You won't be able to quote a single word I said that isn't actually true. but go ahead and try. Don't be vague, quote exactly and specifically which parts I'm wrong about. Go on, I'll be waiting. 
edit - here's a quote, from me, directly contradicting what you think I'm "wrong" about


Nobody knows what the maximum reimbursement is because it's not public and it's also irrelevant because that's Coinbase being reimbursed and not end users. As you may realize, Coinbase' end users do in fact have liability limits. 
Still waiting for you to provide absolutely any quote in which I said something incorrect.

No, they're actually being paid out in BTC at a converted rate. The employer pays taxes first and then converts the balance to BTC.

I actually have a ton of experience in accounting, you're just failing to grasp simple economic concepts. You choose to purchase items **in BTC** and the volatility is part of the game, you don't get to claim now that the item was priced in USD, you paid a converted price **in Bitcoin**. Simple as that. Don't be condescending just because you don't like how this aspect of Bitcoin played out for you. 
People say Newegg and Dell, etc don't really accept BTC and people here love to explain how they do, even if they convert right away. You bought an item priced in BTC and the value changed within a week, welcome to cryptocurrencies. Stop whining about it.

@_date: 2014-10-03 22:40:49
You don't understand. They don't "get" it. Coinbase or BitPay sells 100% of it and gives them cash. Are they supposed to buy BTC at an ATM or on an exchange to pay their employees in? That's never going to happen. 
They do in fact need to hold if they want to pay employees in it. In reality a business would never hold a volatile commodity just because a small group of employees are interested in it.

That's a generous estimate. Overstock is pretty prolific and only sees .1% of their sales in BTC. 


Volatility is *not okay* with shareholders. That 1% of revenue is absolutely, 100% safe as fiat. In BTC there's a risk of your money losing value, and again that risk is absolutely not acceptable by most corporate shareholders. 


And what, lose thousands of dollars in profit when the price dips for the night? That's a ridiculous risk to take as a business. 


You're pretty rude considering you likely haven't been CEO (or even manager) of anything in your life. If you had ever been in a position of fiscal authority you would be able to answer your own questions.

@_date: 2014-08-01 01:50:21


I partially agree with that, but only because the four companies you mentioned are basically the most popular/valuable companies in the world. Dell is an enormous retailer, Newegg is the king of their market and several months ago names like Newegg and Dell wouldn't be shrugged off so easily. 
I know you're bearish but I feel like downplaying Dell et al is just a way of playing off the non-effect they had on the price. Apple accepting Bitcoins (or rather coinbase USD) isn't providing first-worlders who can afford Apple products reason to buy BTC in the first place, and if they aren't holding even 1% they aren't offering employee bonuses or otherwise stimulating the supposed "real true" Bitcoin-only economy. 
I genuinely don't think Amazon or Facebook or Apple accepting USD via Coinbase will do much price-wise. If one of those giants accepted BTC directly, partially paid suppliers in BTC and had good, consistent BTC sales figures to tout on that could have an impact. What we see is short-lived bursts for retailers that rather quickly dwindle away, again nothing that really speaks to the effectiveness of operating on BTC rather than USD

Yeah and as I said the current Bitcoin economy would still function just as it does today. There's *that little demand*. If you can somehow prove otherwise, that there aren't enough Bitcoins on earth to support the less-than-$1B economy we have now at $10, I'm all ears. 


I actually haven't seen anyone live on it without mostly converting to fiat. Same with "doing stuff with it", 99% of merchants don't actually accept it and thus don't actually use it (for their own vendor bills). 
It's a cold, hard reality that Bitcoin doesn't need to be $500. It could easily be $10 or $100 and still function as it does today. There simply isn't an economic necessity for $500 bitcoins, the economic activity simply isn't there.

There's nothing to "buy", it's a fact. It doesn't matter if the transaction occurs on an exchange, the merchant's lack of actual demand for Bitcoins means there is no demand-derived increase in price. Also consider that a merchant holding 0 Bitcoins can't pay a supplier in it (not that their suppliers want it) nor can they pay employees in it (not that employees want that).

Volatility? Overstock started "accepting" BTC early this year, they actually only hold 10% of the Bitcoin they receive. Since they started holding BTC, the price has dropped roughly 60%. That means 10% of their total BTC sales have been devalued a maximum 60%, which could be enough to offset any savings on processing fees and even eat into their profit. 
Holding BTC is a huge risk for businesses with small margins.

Quite simply because inflation is designed to encourage you to spend your fiat in the economy, thus stimulating it? If the value just increased you'd be better off *hoarding* vs lending it out and the economy would wither. This is grade school stuff, by the way.

You're very welcome! 


You shouldn't be that disgusted. As I've said, effective insurance is extremely expensive (miles away from something you can offer people for free) and this kind of loophole is totally common in basically all business. Go to a water park and they might have insurance for you up to your entrance fee. Valet park and you might be insured for the cost of parking. Insurance! Free! It's an attention-getting phrase and unfortunately so few actually bother to read the policies. 


No, because such insurance would be ridiculously expensive. If you find anywhere offering you "free insurance", you can be assured it is worthless. That's about the best I can offer. I suspect actual effective bitcoin insurance would be no less than $100-$200 per month and require you to basically totally lose access to your bitcoins (to totally eliminate potential fraud)


Certainly most insurance providers are sneaky motherfuckers who try to limit payments in any way possible. It's hard to say what's common because compared to Xapo you have things like the FDIC, which do in fact offer 100% free insurance to fiat bank accounts but only (mostly) because fiat transactions are reversible


Sounds like drumming up hype for Xapo to me, but I can't be sure. I would also expect large holders to have completed DD before storing large amounts of wealth with a new company but then again lots of people invested in Neo&amp;Bee who's business plan was "we hope Bitcoins go up!". Having lots of BTC doesn't mean you're particularly smart. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:45:06
Even worse than that, even if they do not go bankrupt they limit losses to membership fees paid. You won't get back anywhere near 100% of your bitcoin if they are lost/stolen, you'll get back 3-6 months worth of fees paid to Xapo. 
It's *insane* how many people here are naive about insurance and just see the word and assume the best.

Not a single example you gave was actually a transaction that takes place solely using Bitcoin.

It's actually saying $100 is the most they'll ever be liable for. 6 months of service (this is the maximum) or, if greater, $100 (that is to say, if $100 is greater than your service fees then $100 is the maximum)

Coinbase' liability to its users ends with those fees. Period. That's what a fucking liability limit is. Go read a fucking book or something you absolute braindead dullard.

Good lord you are a wordy lunatic. 
You've got delusions of grandeur if you think Bitcoin is as revolutionary as the home television, internet or computer. It's a false equivalency you're making, I'm not automatically a fool for doubting Bitcoin and not every naysayer has been wrong. Bitcoin is a niche payment service that may or may not gain more traction as a payment service but isn't at all likely to overthrow the USD or become the global reserve currency. 
At one point in time some guy was calling Beanie Babies overprices, he was a naysayer to their amazing collectible value and he turned out to be right. 
Bitcoins have fallen roughly 70% this year, the USD has been doing great and there's now empirical evidence that capital flight and devaluation of a currency won't necessarily lead to Bitcoin growth.

There is absolutely nothing about that that is a certainty, and I would guess even most of your fellow bitcoiners would be willing to admit that. You're going to be severely disappointed in a few years when you come to terms with the fact that the US economy isn't going to falter any time soon and Bitcoin is at best a marginally useful payment mechanism which most of the primary user base for will continue to ignore for more convenient and familiar options
Most people thought $3000 bitcoins were a certainty by now. I think you'll find Bitcoin is struggling to find another base as prolific as China's adoption in late 2013 and the odds you'll find thousands of suckers willing to pay $20,000 a coin for inherently non-scarce data are slim, pal. You're talking as if there's a 99% chance your friends and family will be willing to pay you $10,000 a coin in 15 years and that's simply not true, nor will it ever be true. You're on a desperate search for Greater Fools and it's beyond hilarious how absolutely certain you are that you're going to get rich for doing absolutely nothing. Good luck!

@_date: 2014-08-03 21:22:52


Yes, you absolutely can. They are technically insured...that insurance is for $100 or the sum of your fees paid during that month. Are you really not familiar with this type of corporate loophole? 
They could be insuring accounts for $1 and still be able to claim they are insured. You are still insured for a dollar, aren't you?
How about you find me the magical clause that dictates they are 100% insured with no limit? Or the clause that specifically excludes their insurer from the other limited liability clause? I'll save you some time: They don't exist. 


Again, it's very clear. I see no reason for you to presume a judge would "throw it out" when it specifically that essentially everybody's liabilities are limited. 
One more thing - 




Perhaps you should read the ToS even more thoroughly as you seem to have missed the part where your beloved Xapo has customers waive their right to sue and agree to arbitration. No judge will ever "throw out" a lawsuit because, surprise! They've limited their liability to the point where you can't even sue them. 
I can tell you're going to (forgive me) mindlessly trust in Xapo regardless of the plain english terms in front of you, but I'd certainly urge you to have a lawyer confirm what I already know. I promise you the best answer you'll get from Xapo is "read the terms"

Their insurance provider isn't providing a service to them? Fairly confident they'll be pointing to this liability limit when anybody bothers to make a claim. Insurance is expensive, it simply makes no sense that they're offering free, *effective* insurance. Much easier to claim "insurance!" and have ridiculously low liability limits for Coinbase and their service providers (insurers)
I'm no expert (you may be?) but considering I've yet to see a single Bitcoin-insured company link to their specific insurance policy I believe the aforementioned limits will apply.

I agree that it is significant for Coinbase as a sudden loss of a large amount of Bitcoins uninsured could potentially sink their business, however I believe my conclusion to be a fair one in that, ultimately, users *will* be limited in their losses by the aforementioned ToS. That phrasing and LL is in place for a specific reason, and I believe Coinbase will use their legal backing to avoid actually fully compensating users who incur supposedly insured losses.

Check my post history, I'm well aware what that chart represents. It makes a lot more sense as a metric than yours, and I'll explain why
First, yours actually shows we've been bouncing around the same number of transactions since February. That's not really growth, though it is very slightly increasing on average. 
The real problem lies in the fact that number of transactions is totally irrelevant when judging economic activity. A handful of people could be sending completely insignificant amounts of money between each other and contribute to a high number of transactions. That's not showing a healthy, active economy. Comparing economic activity (transaction volume) comparatively to USD shows a better picture of how much actual money is being tossed around, and that amount hasn't grown practically at all. 
Basically, hundreds of people sending fractions of a penny between each other thousands of times is less compelling of an economy and metric of growth than people transferring ever-increasing amounts of actual value and wealth around relative to other stable units of value 
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:15:46
Yeah, I understand that. The problem is it makes no sense because the more business it draws in the more money he loses. 
I don't know why I need to spell this out for people here but merchants giving away money isn't a good thing for business. More volume doesn't matter is each sale is a net loss

Perhaps not so much because PayPal was innovating at a time when the internet was still a cumbersome mess. It's 2014 now and technology is a seamless part of most people's lives.

Considering Dell, Newegg, etc didn't do anything (regarding the price), I don't believe Apple or Amazon will mean much either. Especially so if either aforementioned retailer is simply accepting Coinbase/Bitpay USD. 
For a retailer to positively affect Bitcoin they have to both directly accept and use Bitcoin in their business, accepting converted fiat isn't making any statements regarding the usefulness of accepting BTC. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem because merchants will nearly always convert to fiat given the chance and when that opportunity exists they have no incentive to accept and use BTC. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:19:52

Second, boy howdy are you wrong. Early adopters own thousands upon thousands of Bitcoins. Satoshi is rumored to own roughly 1 million of them. Adoption of Bitcoin wouldn't level any playing fields, it would simply create a different 1%. 


It's funny to see all these assumptions and conclusions being made about a company that has been around for decades and will likely continue on for another several decades vs. a 6-year old technology that has gained marginal notoriety and averages far less than 1 transaction per second. 
In short, OP, you're suffering from delusions of grandeur and talking directly out of your asshole when you pretend that WU needs to "adapt" to bitcoin.

Fair enough, but paying bills isn't an exciting task. It's a mundane one people do every day with fiat for no fee and without worrying about differing exchanges or spending .10 BTC today paying a bill that could be worth $500 next year


This isn't going to aid in adoption at all. If you've already got BTC it's a good way to spend it, but "being able to pay your bills" alone isn't going to entice anyone new to buy BTC because they can already pay their bills in fiat without going fiat &gt; bitcoin &gt; fiat in the first place.

They should (and are) charging whatever they can get away with. Again, that's a business doing very well. 
If you think Bitcoin is remotely competitive you must be oblivious to the fact that Bitcoin runs on a charity and the actual cost per transaction will be much higher once the block reward is no longer subsidizing Bitcoin's network (aka giving miners a reason to process)


Yeah $14 per transaction is much better than 40 cents. If Bitcoin miner revenue drops 90% following the block reward loss transactions would *still* cost $1.40.

I proved to you mining is centralized now and is trending towards more centralization and the best you can muster is "you're a troll herp derp"

This is simply untrue, friend. 


Let me just say I'm well-versed in reading and interpreting legalese. I'm not making assumptions, you are. I'm reading plain english text about who is limited and what that limit is. It's completely clear, actually. 


Again, they aren't assumptions, they are interpretations of plain english terms of service. You're the one making baseless assumptions *in direct contradiction to what is written in plain English*


Yes, you are, your position is "that can't possibly be true! My eyes deceive me and despite the text being very clear I think, for a reason I can't explain, that the legal limitations don't apply". It's a rather ridiculous position, but that's the one you're choosing. Please note the naivete and aforementioned "benefit of the doubt" you're so easily willing to afford. 


Nobody needs more of a clarification than plain English black-and-white Terms of Service. When you call Xapo or speak with a representative this is what they will refer you to. It wasn't written by the owner's granddaughter or a college friend, Terms are specifically written by lawyers and it's no coincidence or mistake that they've specifically limited liability for themselves and subs/service providers.

In all of 2014, *exactly what I said*. If Bitcoins is used by thousands of people but only valued at $1 a coin it will be considered a failure by many (not myself). I don't personally consider this year's "uptake and acceptance" to be very good considering the only thing that happened was merchants realized they could get fiat from bitcoiners without having to touch Bitcoin and they're happy to do that but it doesn't help the price, which has been proven all year. 
Again, Buffet is not a "stupid fuck" and anybody who thinks he is probably is a "stupid fuck" themselves. He was right about Bitcoin in general based on the crumbling valuation of the network in all of 2014 and is likely going to be right in 2015 since things are on track to just keep going the way they have been going - down.

That's irrelevant guy. It doesn't matter if Bitcoin is a company, fact of the matter is miners are receiving Bitcoins from somewhere (thin air, computer software, whatever you want to call it)
I'm not making any assertions. I'm presenting facts. Miners mine for Bitcoins, they pay an electrical bill using Bitcoins as 99.7% of their total revenue. It doesn't particularly matter where the money (Bitcoins) comes from but it will matter a whole hell of a lot when the money runs out.

Here we go again...
OP, there's no sense in harassing chat reps for the answers you're looking for. Follow the link provided to you and you can find their Terms of Service 
wherein they make clear they have very little liability for any losses incurred:
9.1. **Limitations of Liability**. **IN NO EVENT SHALL COINBASE**, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, **BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE COINBASE SITE**, THE COINBASE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT (**HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE**). Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. **THE LIABILITY OF COINBASE**, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, **TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF** (A) THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES; **OR (B) FEES PAID TO COINBASE BY YOU IN THE PRECEDING THREE (3) MONTHS.**
So the simple answer is if you somehow lose money, despite Joe's assurance that it's impossible, they won't be paying you back any more than you've paid them over the last three months. There's also a typical class-action waiver and dispute resolution agreement so you can't sue them if you don't like what you agreed to either.

In his first post. You're so quick to argue with me you aren't even reading the posts you're replying to. 


This isn't obvious. This isn't their legal obligation. Can you at least confirm you understand what "legal obligation" means? Coinbase will be reimbursed, yes, whether or not they fully reimburse their customers is their decision. Customers aren't legally entitled to a full reimbursement, so no it isn't "obvious" that they'll go above and beyond their legal obligations. Maybe their insurance payout won't be enough to fully reimburse users. 


They may or may not have intentions of paying their users, if they intended 100% of the time on repaying 100% of losses their ToS wouldn't have such a severely limited liability. They've left the door open for themselves to only pay 3 months worth of fees. Again, can you confirm you understand that's what they're obligated to according to law? 
If coinbase suffers a catastrophic loss that exceeds their insured amount, they have no obligation to repay customers 100%. That's what the ToS is for, to limit their liability. I don't know how many times I need to repeat this to you but a benevolent choice they may or may not make is not as reliable as their actual contract with their customers. You're counting on them going above and beyond their policy each and every time, I'm simply saying they don't have to. 
Still waiting on you to back up your claims that these liability limits don't hold up in court. You've mentioned this to me a few times but have yet to actually post any evidence in your favor. 




This is in fact exactly what Coinbase has with their insurer. Whoosh, I guess? It's a perfectly valid comparison.


And if they don't receive enough of a reimbursement from their insurer (you haven't read the policy so don't even begin to claim you know how much they are insured for, and no it isn't "unlimited bitcoins") they'll only be obligated to reimburse an amount in accordance with their liability limit. And you can't sue for more. So much for safe custody, eh?

@_date: 2014-08-03 22:59:19


That's the limit of their liability. $100, or the amount of fees paid. Basically "we aren't responsible for any losses beyond $100 or whatever fees you've paid us, if any, whichever is less." It's a very common (and absolutely legal) loophole. 


That's...not what it means. 
Let's just look at the only part that matters:


aka no matter-fucking-what that's the limit of their liability. 


"Subject to the terms"...means subject to the aforementioned total liability limit clause. IN NO EVENT. 
Not to be rude, but you'd be pretty gullible/naive to even need "clarity from Circle". This is their public terms of service written in plain English and you'll find it's not unlike the ToS of thousands of other companies successfully limiting their liability to consumers in a very similar manner.

I guess you haven't been paying attention. The price *was* following a bit of a logarithmic growth pattern, but that pattern has been dead since late June. 
Entertain me, though - what big catalyst do you think will have people paying more than ten times what Bitcoins are worth today? 
I adore that you think there's going to be two more bubbles in two years despite people from the last bubble having still not turned a profit after nine months and the price currently having been stuck at less than half the record high throughout this entire year. Tim Draper bought almost $20M worth of Bitcoins and the price has dropped almost $200/BTC since. Gigantic retailers like Dell and Newegg now accept Bitcoin and the price has only dropped since, so what big change is going to be the one to convince your grandmother and friends to pay you $8000/BTC? It's honestly pretty preposterous, I thought ridiculous expectations for growth were a thing of the past by now. 
Here's a link to moral_agent's "Bubble watch" so you can get a grasp on how far we are away from your "if the next big rise mimics the last one" 
and the last big rise was largely due to essentially the entire nation of China going bananas over bitcoin. Now, thousands of people have lost money in Gox and thousands more have seen their investment lose half its value...what gigantic group of people do you think are next to rush in and potentially lose half their money? I propose to you that the rest of the world has "learned its lesson" about rushing into Bitcoin and people that haven't already bought likely don't have a need for Bitcoins.

You just **have** to make ridiculous assumptions that *maybe* it's different because bitcoin? Let me clear this up for you - it's not different.

What the good fuck are you even talking about? I'm not "arguing against the very basic law of supply and demand" i'm telling you there is very little economic activity within the bitcoin economy. Retailers see absolutely pathetic sales figures and transaction volume has essentially been stagnant for an entire year while public searches for Bitcoin are basically at an all-time low. 
Here, I'll spell it out for you - THERE IS NO DEMAND. 


Why would it? Magically? because bitcoins are suddenly being rewarded to miners at a reduced rate? That's no reason for the price to increase. There's no new demand for bitcoins, just a lower supply. Lol, you don't even know how this shit works


No, only consensus of the miners, who obviously have it in their interests to raise fees as high as they can get away with since they're used to a ridiculously high block reward paying their electrical bills

@_date: 2014-09-02 16:22:05


Okay, now you're definitely missing the point. Selling it to another user on the open market is a far stretch from using that commodity within your business. If every merchant is simply "selling on the open market", that's a statement that no retailer wants to hold BTC and none of their suppliers are accepting it. If you need to explain why that isn't "a good thing" you've got problems. 


Right. Now, merchants immediately dump BTC. they don't use it to buy supplies or pay employers or anything within their actual economy, they're just getting rid of it. Again, do you really need me to explain how these things are different? Banks use money to buy investments, to lend it, to pay their electricity bills. They don't dump it immediately, which is what I'm getting at. You can't use bitcoins for any of that shit so they have to get rid of it. It's not exactly leading to a self-sustaining economy when nobody wants the things. 
Let me try to ELI5 this for you since you definitely need it - 
USD merchants get paid in USD. They can spend this USD on their utilities, to pay employees, basically hundreds of different uses within the USD economy. If they pay their employees in it, their employees might spend the same USD in the store, recirculating the money. This is good for the economy. 
USD merchants get paid in BTC. They are immediately dumped. You can't pay your utilities with BTC you don't have (not that your utility company accepts them anyway). You can't pay your employee in BTC you don't have. It simply goes back to an exchange to be spent and dumped again. If you can't spend it anywhere but a few consumer goods retailers it doesn't actually spread out through the economy, the money stays in a small closed loop wherein a true BTC economy never flourishes. It's not even close to the same thing as a merchant converting their francs to USD or whatever because USD is the goal all along, and in other countries those francs are used in the same way for a closed loop economy. But Bitcoin has no closed loop economy, nor any retailers that want to keep it. I hope you understand now why this isn't good. 
To go on another small rant, lending in BTC isn't feasible. I lend you 200BTC for a house today, and in five years you owe me the same 200BTC but with 25BTC in interest, *plus all the BTC appreciation*. You might end up owing $1,000,000 for a $100,000 house. The price could also drop, which would screw the lender. Insuring BTC isn't feasible, lending BTC doesn't make sense, and no retailers want to hold on to it, but magically one day these problems will all go away because Bitcoin, right?

Your response to OP's problem works, but it's massively inconvenient. If a sale or good deal happens you're scrambling to get to the bank or transfer from coinbase, seems like added hassle to me. 
Like OP said, traditional banking prevents theft of your entire savings. With bitcoin you have to limit your potential spending due to a risk of losing it all at once. It's an inconvenience people traditionally don't have to deal with

Is this some sort of joke? There may be more retailers accepting BTC but practically none of them hold it. There's basically nowhere in the world you can spend BTC, have that BTC used to pay a supplier, and have that supplier pay their employees.

No shit. And it's a relevant cost. Do the miners participating in Bitcoin not receive Bitcoin? Do they not process transactions? Stop being ignorant of facts.

Unfortunately, although I can barely parse this English, I'm sure you're wrong. 


Nah there's absolutely no fallacies involved in connecting straight lines. If bitcoin *could* be run on one computer but isn't that's a fallacy to use a potential cost as a real cost. Real miners are mining real bitcoins and processing real transactions and thus they are real costs, mmmmmmmmmmmkay?

Chances are if they're bold enough to say "so long as it's your fault we're liable for unlimited losses" then they probably have a billion little loopholes to prove you didn't do your job securing your bitcoins. 
Anxiously awaiting this revised liability section, cause the response I got doesn't sound realistic. 
If on Day 1 you guys lose 100,000 BTC, I somehow doubt you'll be held liable. It's just not realistic that you guys offer 100% reimbursement insurance for free without having some legal loopholes to protect yourself. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:47:20


Nope. It means you have a 1 BTC balance with them, they have no obligation to reimburse you in full for the loss of that 1 BTC. That's literally exactly what the ToS says. Their liability to you is limited to 3 months worth of service fees paid to them, they are not obligated to reimburse you any amount higher than that.

Amazon pays 1.15%. They certainly aren't saving 2%. 
I don't think any retailers pay anywhere near 6% processing fees. You're exaggerating the fees to make Bitcoin look better, which is okay I guess, but it's stupid to suggest that Bitcoin can save retailers anywhere near 4% and even stupider to suggest they give away an addiitonal 5% of their revenue


Those with small margins can still do *what*? Save "6%" and then give away an additional 4%?
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:03:09


No? 


Again, no. A change in purchasing power does not constitute a payment. You could say new coin buyers are "paying" the block reward when they buy coins but they aren't really, $400 in Bitcoins has $400 in purchasing power at Dell, there's no Block Reward fee. The block reward is coming out of thin air, something that miners can sell for revenue. This is going to disappear and though difficulty will drop the transaction fee, their only remaining revenue, will rise dramatically. In two years miners are going to lose more than 50% of their revenue and still have to pay the same bills. You're delusional if you think this means people will suddenly pay twice as much for Bitcoins

Beyond the fact that you can't read properly, you'll find BTC Black Friday was a dud at most retailers any way. There just isn't a lot of economic activity in a deflationary currency, especially when the price is "low" and people think they will sacrifice future purchasing power by spending BTC now
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:49:25


This is incorrect, fyi. They do pay a processing fee. 
None of what you're insisting I read explains how a company gains 5% EPS based on lower processing fees on one quarter of one percent of their transactions. That math, again, **does not make sense*
Lowering (not eliminating, get it straight) the transaction cost on a tiny fraction of their sales couldn't have possibly contributed so much to their EPS.

That's not true, though. There's no shortage of Bitcoins and again, the actual active bitcoin economy is terribly small. There's enough Bitcoins to go around, even at $10. 
Like, link me to any single purchase that would not currently have been possible at $10 a bitcoin. Any single transaction for which there aren't enough bitcoins in circulation to cover the sale. A $500,000 house sold for 800 BTC last year. That's 50k BTC at $10 each. 50K BTC is a few days worth of mining a coin that's been out for five years. Your argument holds no water, sorry. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:40:41
Actually it's got a range of over $100


and is widely criticized inside of r/bitcoinmarkets for various reasons. 
The entire purpose of difficulty is to even out this balance and yes, bring the cost to mine closer to the market price (as more people join to mine). However, *the entire concept of difficulty* is arbitrary and, among gold, silver, oil and bitcoin is unique to bitcoin. I wouldn't argue that an investor would need this information, but the aspect of arbitrary difficulty increases are certainly also required knowledge when considering investing in bitcoins

It's not a straw man you idiot, you literally said "The block reward goes on for the rest of our lives" as if that was any substantial sort of revenue for miners from that stream. The block reward loses relevance when it's all gone. I'm trying to explain to you how a company cannot run without income and you're basically saying "oh well they're still collecting pennies"
let me again summarize this for you, because clearly you need some help
Currently miners get **99.5%** of their revenue from the block reward
In 20 years the block reward will be more than 99% gone
That means miners lose a gigantic chunk of revenue and bitcoiners make up for it in transaction fees.

The "fees" right now are paid to the miners via the block reward. Basically the fees you normally pay for banking services are being paid to miners in the form of Bitcoins they can sell. 
In less than 20 years 99% of all bitcoins will have been mined and miners, who are required to process transactions, will still have to pay their electricity bills using something. 
Right now miners get 99.7% of their money from the block reward and only .3% of their revenue from fees. This is why Bitcoin fees are so cheap. Within 20 years when the block reward virtually disappears expect transaction fees to rise in order to match the revenue miners are used to making, otherwise expect to wait a long time for your transactions.

You're right, the percentage amount is irrelevant. What's relevant is that it makes no sense for merchants to offer a discount *bigger than their savings* for customers paying in Bitcoin.

Nobody needs to get paid to recognize these problems and certainly nobody is paying the crazy bitcoiners to act the way they do, encouraging others to mock their insanity. 
I don't think there are people paid to discredit bitcoin quite simply because there are plenty of people doing it out there for free. It's quite easy to recognize serious flaws if you aren't totally absorbed by bitcoin and take a criticism of the currency as a personal attack on your bank account. Some of these flaws aren't going to effect Bitcoin until next year or for five years and so nobody here wants to talk about or think about them with any honest reflection, they just all hope the price skyrockets to the moon for no reason so they can sell their digital e-cash for a huge profit and basically get rich for doing nothing.

You "recover from the INSURER" alright. Up to $100, just as they have limited their liability. Consult a lawyer or email Xapo themselves if you still feel I might be wrong, I assure you your interpretation of this is totally incorrect and your anger is unnecessary, also especially confusing since you're quite clearly talking above your own knowledge level here.

Your friend has a bit of a point. I'll go out on a limb here and expect some downvotes for doing so
20% of all Bitcoin wealth in the world is owned by ~100 people. That's 20% of an entire currency not being used for commerce or anything, really, just sitting there hoping for growth. That's your few individuals stockpiling. 
As for validity to his claims, because of it's (future) deflationary nature people are less likely to spend bitcoins now and will defer purchases until their BTC are more valuable. When Overstock, the first large retailer to accept Bitcoins, started, they saw a boom of purchases amounting to 1% of their total business. Since that time, the price per Bitcoin has fallen and, in turn, so has spending at Overstock. Sales (in BTC) dropped to less than one tenth of one percent of total sales (according to the CEO) and have since slightly risen to one quarter of one percent. Essentially, people stopped spending Bitcoins because they feel they are "undervalued" right now, and Overstock is seeing less sales. 
In the "bigger picture", if your local Mom &amp; Pop Soda Shoppe was actually relying on Bitcoin sales, they could be in some trouble. People don't want to spend 1 BTC for $500 USD today when (hopefully) next year that same BTC has twice the purchasing power, so they don't spend and Mom &amp; Pop have to downsize or go out of business. 
Some people here say that means less frivolous spending, apparently a good thing, but ask Mom &amp; Pop or any other retailer/business owner and their business relies on people spending their money, not holding it until its worth more.

"Securer" isn't a word. A $5 fee isn't much at all, I suspect you'd lose more than $5 trying to convert $1000 worth of BTC to USD in order to actually spend the money. 
See, that's the thing. You can send BTC for a tiny fee now, but the recipient has to convert that BTC (at some cost) to a more usable currency. Oh, and the Bitcoin transaction fee will be a lot higher once the block reward subsidy runs out (less than 20 years for 99% of bitcoins mined)
Cost Per Transaction 	$33.25
This is a fee paid by the block reward, it helps miners with their electrical bills. Once the block reward runs out, where do you think this money will come from? It will come from your pocket as a transaction fee.

There isn't a finite number of bitcoins, only a finite number of Bitcoins. Bitcoins are artificially scarce but nobody needs to value that or bother only using bitcoins. 
Just like OP's students say, the blockchain works just as well whether the units are $1 or $1000 and whether there's a limit of 1,000,000,000 or no limit. Deflation isn't inherently tied to cryptocurrencies.

It's arguably the same hassle (providing personal information to an exchange or credit card company) but it's buying x amount of bitcoin once and being able to spend it at a half-dozen notable retailers vs. getting a credit card with a rewards program that's accepted by literally millions of retailers around the world with no concerns of volatility or exchange rate. 
People don't see getting a credit card as a hassle, they see it as a good thing because it is so universally useful. The same cannot be said for Bitcoin, and most cannot be bothered to buy some even to take advantage of an amazing 3% off.

Let me stop you right there. 45 days is the comment submission period. You have 45 days to send in comments or suggestions for the BitLicense regulations. After that 45 days they will probably work on the proposed regulations for several weeks or months. They won't even begin a "thorough review" until after the comment period has concluded. 
If you want an extension of the comment period that's one thing, but don't think they're only spending 45 days on the regulations "update" because that's a misunderstanding of the "comment period" on your part.

@_date: 2014-08-08 23:11:21
Okay, so you've admitted it's arbitrarily high. Now what's the point in knowing the real-world arbitrary cost? Let's say an ounce of gold costs $100 to mine. Now because of some arbitrary nonsense (smaller tools, let's say) it costs $1500. Why should anybody care about an arbitrarily-inflated price?
Put it another way - you pay somebody to do a job, let's say mow your lawn. You agree to $20 an hour thinking they'll finish in an hour. Turns out they're using scissors and spend 20 hours on your lawn. You'd never hire that person again because nobody uses artificially-high rates when considering the cost of labor just like nobody should bother considering what it currently costs to mine a bitcoin in relation to its value. 
edit - actually a better example would just be buying gold from two different companies. One of them uses shovels, one of them uses toothpicks. One charges $1500 an ounce the other charges $60,000. Why would you consider the latter company when determining the price of gold? If someone is mining something with an arbitrary difficulty imposed that's obscuring the real cost

No, they are far from the same thing, because with Western Union you both send and receive local currencies which are typically spendable in 100% of locations and with Bitcoin you've received a Bitcoin which still must be converted to another currency to spend. 
One is immediately useful and spendable money and the other is a token for a volatile amount of currency that you now have to find someone to cash out with. 
Like, I have no idea how you could possibly think they are the same thing other than the obvious answer that you're just a typical disingenuous bitcoiner

Let me give you a little lesson, and then perhaps you should read the whitepaper: Bitcoin was not created for third-parties to be built on top of it. It was not created so BitPay could convert them to USD and pay merchants. Bitcoin was created as a **peer to peer** currency that **doesn't require the trust of a third party**. Bitcoin was explicitly created to avoid companies like BitPay.

It is literally Ben Lawsky's job to pass regulations.

I haven't intended my position to be "Coinbase **won't** pay", just that they aren't obligated to should worst-case scenario. I'm not saying in each and every scenario they will deny reimbursing customers, just that it's troubling they've essentially left it to their own discretion. 


Fair point, a "liability-limited" reimbursement is indeed only likely if they've suffered a catastrophic loss, not simply losing 1 or 10 BTC and choosing an account to suffer the losses.


Which is why I said, when push comes to shove, they turn to their contractual obligations with the customer. Businesses aren't charities and companies don't give money away out of the goodness of their heart. 


Negligence is actually listed under the same liability limits so, where applicable by law, they would actually be protected even in a case of negligence. 


And isn't that the genius part? They have insurance*!
*Actual liability limits 3 months customer fees
This isn't fraud in that they make clear how limited their actual insurance is within their ToS, a document easily available to customers. I would agree that it's fraudulent to claim "100% coverage" and not provide that, but of course Coinbase isn't offering "100% coverage", simply "we have insurance!*". It's not fraud when customers are naive and don't bother to read their Terms

I love these transactions, same with the guy who paid 800BTC for a $500k house. Those $103k worth of BTC are worth $30k now.
Imagine how much the merchant saved on processing fees by using and hodling Bitcoins! only -$70,000
ed - of course,thankfully, the merchant uses a service to convert immediately to fiat and aren't liable for this volatility loss but I'm sure it'll only be a few weeks or months before merchants directly accept BTC and destroy their entire profit margins

Oh wait what? Bitcoin hasn't taken the world by storm or anything, it's not totally implausible that an inflationary cryptocurrency could be successful in modern commerce. The inherently lower transaction costs of cryptocurrencies aren't tied to deflation you know. In fact Bitcoins could work just as well with no supply limit, the function of cryptocurrencies aren't tied to deflation pal. 
Seems to be like the bulk of the world's wealth is already in an inflationary currency - the US Dollar. Much larger network effect than Bitcoin too, people are already familiar with inflation and despite the complaints aired here by libertarians most people don't seem to mind. 
Bitcoin has been around for five years and, to borrow a funny comparison, less people use Bitcoin than have seen The Smurfs 2. You're naive to believe that deflationary Bitcoin has an absolute stranglehold on the cryptocurrency world for all eternity. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:28:38
It's a very difficult question to answer, but also a pointless one. A barrel of oil has a real-world labor cost of production, as does an ounce of gold. Aside from advances in efficiency and technology you can't much lower these costs. The price of mining a bitcoin is somewhat arbitrarily high and has no real connection to it's value. 
In short, just because it cost someone a million dollars in electricity to mine a single BTC doesn't mean that BTC is worth anywhere near a million dollars. You can mine different "bitcoins" (altcoins) for a fraction of the cost but there's no 
altgold" or "dogeoil" because gold, silver and oil are real-world, physical, *unique* items.

Or, get this, *there's no such thing as arbitrary difficulty increases* and it still costs a fraction of a dollar to mine a Bitcoin. The difficulty thing is totally arbitrary, so it's nothing like finding a new vein of gold. it's like mining existing gold veins with broken pickaxes
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:27:05


...or a third non-cash non-bitcoin option (like MPESA)? 
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:45:39
I don't see how you could disagree to be frank. Rising difficulty is a totally arbitrary thing (to serve a purpose, of course), but consider something like difficulty applying to gold, oil or silver - imagine the tools used to extract gold became 10x more expensive arbitrarily, or were made twice as large in order to slow down production. There's no such thing as increasing difficulty in the real world and thus the idea of increasing difficulty (and the rising cost that results) has no relevance to the real-world "value" of a bitcoin. 
I would argue the actual real-world cost of mining a bitcoin is as cheap as you can mine the smallest unit of literally any cryptocurrency. Mining "Bitcoins" specifically has an artificially-increased cost that couldn't be compared to the real-world cost of extracting gold or oil with no artificial "difficulty" handicaps

Credit card fees are a fraction of the price. How do you figure they will lose money if they aren't giving away 100% of their profit? 
Merchants accept CCs (and their fees) because it is convenient for the consumer. You as a consumer need not be worried about what merchants are doing. 
Just a quick question - if a sandwich is $1 what do you think the credit card fee is for that sandwich? $1.01? Would it surprise you to learn that the fee is probably more like 10 cents? 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:00:16
Going to politely disagree with this. Most people I see interested in using bitcoin couldn't care less about the libertarian dream of a deflationary currency, they use it for cheaper transaction processing and for remittances, neither of which are dependent on the deflationary aspect. 
Kind of strange to claim something that won't occur for another 100+ years is drawing people to bitcoin. For most it's about privacy or anonymity or lowering transaction costs, not because people believe a (future) deflationary currency would work in modern society. 
I'd rather not open a big can of worms here but there's two giant problems with the deflationary thing -  is people are less likely to spend and more likely to hoard, which hurts the economy and  is that miners currently make something like 99% of their revenue from the block reward (inflation). Once this block reward ends and the currency truly becomes "deflationary", transaction costs will have to rise to meet the former block reward (so miners can pay their bills). Current cost per transaction (including miner reward) is upwards of $25, so we could be looking at $20 fees per transaction, if not more, if people want their transactions confirmed in a timely manner. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:04:00

The main problem is that Coinbase can't just issue their own Visa/Mastercard, they need to negotiate an agreement to allow them to work on the Visa/Mastercard networks.

Those are some ridiculous "ifs". Amazon accepting BTC is good for current holders, but doesn't provide a reason for Joe Average to not just use his rewards-providing credit card. It also drives the price down as Amazon isn't owned by a Libertarian like Overstock and Amazon almost certainly wouldn't hold any bitcoins, just like Dell and Newegg and tigerdirect and Expedia and most every other bitcoin-accepting retailer don't actually receive any bitcoins 


Yeah okay you've lost me here with your jerkoff libertarian fantasies. A currency that swings wildly each day and has sat at half its previous value for a year is not primed to replace any world currency, let alone surpass them all. 
I'll leave you alone with your dreams now though. Look at transaction volume charts, volume (and demand for) bitcoins is in the gutter. Five years into the "new money revolution" things should be going a hell of a lot quicker than they are. 


That series of graphs I linked you to illustrates very well how poorly they line up, actually. Did you not notice we're well below the absolute lowest previous "boundary"?

It's not obvious. You know people can buy coins off-exchange, right? Why didn't they buy as many coins as possible? 
Listen, if Wall St was buying coins it would be more obvious than a $200 jump. Millions upon millions of dollars entering the BTC economy would jump the price back up to the ATH, not a paltry $100 increase. 
I'm sorry but you're plain old wrong about your assumptions. Wall St wasn't interested at $350, they certainly aren't interested (yet) now. What you're saying makes very little sense if you actually think about it - whether buying at $350 or $500 they would make ridiculous returns *if they were actually interested in investing* but they aren't.

I'd be inclined to agree with you, but there was a big discussion in bitcoinmarkets recently about how these companies aren't even touching BTC for one second. It is converted before they receive it, so it's not even something they do "next". If the companies aren't holding bitcoins they aren't creating any more demand, just more selling pressure. It's very relevant if the only reason they want bitcoins is to sell them immediately, it means they'll never directly accept and if Coinbase goes down so does their acceptance.

Neither does Bitcoin. Exchanges need banks to operate. BTC ATMS need banks to operate. Circle and Coinbase need banks to operate. You can't buy shit on Dell or Newegg with Bitcoins without using fiat because Dell and Newegg don't actually take Bitcoins, BitPay gives them terrible government controlled currency. 
There's barely a single aspect of the bitcoin ecosystem that isn't dependent on the fiat banking infrastructure.

I have to clarify this, Xapo's "insured vault" is garbage. So is Circles. You know how much insurance you have? Let me just guess: You think 100% of your BTC are 100% insured. 
The truth? Xapo and Circle both have limited liability. That limit is the amount of membership fees or tx fees paid. So if you lose 100 BTC in your insured vault you might get back a few USD. 
Please read insurance policies before being so confident in what amounts to a worthless insurance.

Are you that naive that you really believe lawmakers like Lawsky *don't*  have the power to regulate BTC? I hate to break it to you but regulating Bitcoin is nothing like regulating video game points. Bitcoin *will* be regulated, within NY and shortly after the rest of the US, within a few months. 


Okay, but they're still charging it right? Merchants have no interest in skirting the law or avoiding regulations. You might think they are dumb or wrong or whatever but don't kid yourself into believing Bitcoin is immune to regulations. 
You're talking in a bunch of ridiculous hyperbole and it doesn't show much maturity, even worse coming from a mod. Show me a single online store accepting seashells as payment. Link me to the company providing employee payroll in seashells. 
You want Bitcoin to be a player in the worldwide financial instrument market it's going to be as regulated as everything else.

This is downright pathetic. This isn't a list of trolls, it's a list of everybody who disagrees with the hive mind or doubts Bitcoins would be worth $5000 by now or $10,000 by next year. 
Remember, it's the "trolls" who were saying $1000 BTC were crazy overvaluated and not worth that much. It was the "trolls" who suggested a prediction of $20k per bitcoin by the end of 2014 wasn't realistic. 
This list is pathetic, and the OP is especially so. How sad it must be to get so angry about people who disagree with your opinions 
People like BuffyBitcoinSlayer are worse for the bitcoin community than any troll could ever be. People like the OP shove their fingers deep in their ear when they hear concerns about Bitcoin and shout "troll" at the top of their lungs choosing to remain wholly ignorant of the issues that caused Bitcoins to fall 70+% this year

I should clarify - you see a transaction from your wallet to BitPay's. There is no on-chain transaction between the buyer and Newegg because Newegg isn't actually accepting or ever holding any BTC. 
OP said "every transaction must take place on the blockchain" but this is definitely false. You can't see what Coinbase or BitPay do with your BTC after you've sent them either, so the transactions they make with your BTC are presumably off-chain. 
In the absolute simplest terms I can pay someone to hand over their private key and take ownership of their BTC without actually making a transaction on the chain. Nothing about Bitcoin requires transactions to actually take place on the blockchain, and the blockchain couldn't even handle a small amount of traffic if it did. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:48:28


Cheap, eh?


You don't realize the cost of transactions are being subsidized by the block reward right now. Bitcoin is paying miners $18 per transaction, and this number was much higher when the price was also higher. The block reward charity makes up 99.7% of miner's revenues, and when the block reward expires (or even decreases) they are going to have to get their electricity bill money from the only other source of income - the "cheap" transaction fees that currently only make up .3% of their revenue. 
I fucking *love* when people refer to Bitcoin as "cheap" or "free" because they absolutely must not understand how Bitcoin works to think that. Bitcoin is costing millions upon millions of dollars per month in electricity to handle a paltry 1 transaction per second of average.

It's a temporary sale, not something they're offering forever and they aren't offering a sale because that's how much BTC is saving them. It's simply a stimulus to encourage people to spend a currency they're less likely to spend when the price was low. It's a great sale, sure, but fiat customers have Black Friday sales every year that are essentially better. That same Newegg deal doesn't apply to preorder items, marketplace items, or any item with a free gift so it's rather limited. If bitcoin-accepting merchants were offering deals like this constantly that would be a good reason for people to buy BTC, but in a few days the sale will be over and that talking point will be gone. At such a discount they aren't making much profit at all, it's a loss-leader sale to hopefully get the same boon that Overstock saw at launch. They also aren't holding any BTC so any BTC spent at newegg may as well be a sale on an exchange for fiat in terms of market effect. That's all BitPay is doing anyway.

Bitcoin is one of any number of "bitcoins". Dogecoin is a bitcoin, so it Litecoin. That may help you understand. 
Bitcoin (big B) has a limited number of units. Literally just a number picked out of the air with no significance because it sounded like a good number.  Anybody can create another cryptocurrency with no limit to the number of units and that would eliminate the "necessity" of high-valued Bitcoins due to artificial scarcity. 
Obviously there is serious doubt whether a newbie cryptocurrency could gain any considerable value in the shadow of the original Bitcoin but I frankly don't think it would be difficult for a reputable company to create a cryptocurrency that practically overnight gains more users than Bitcoin

No, because quite simply retailers do things to satisfy their customers and not to serve themselves. Following your logic, retailers would have denied credit cards long ago for cash-only sales. Obviously bitcoins can be used online unlike cash but the point remains, refusing customers who use Visa and Mastercard would absolutely negate any minor profits gained from the Amex customers. 
If the big benefit of your hypothetical card is for the merchants, customers have no incentive to get the card. If the card is already subsidizing fraud losses and operating at a lower margin than the others they probably won't be able to offer the same rewards offered by Visa and MC. Consumers won't switch cards just to shop, they'll shop at the merchant still taking all cards and not losing business.

The bank didn't threaten to remove the money because it wasn't a "bona fide transaction" (smh), it's because the transaction allegedly involved fraudulent funds. Buying and selling Bitcoin isn't the problem (or maybe it is because you admit they apparently don't allow it anyway) but selling Bitcoin to somebody who pays you with a stolen CC number or stolen cheques is. 
Basically your complaint is stupid, especially so because of this:

But you paid in BTC, right? Amazon.com prices their stuff in USD, but I pay in CAD with my credit card. Different currencies can be converted that way, you see. 


They aren't excluded, which is exactly why companies like Newegg don't want to hold your bitcoins, they instantly convert to a stable USD. They aren't a bank storing and insuring your bitcoins from depreciation, they're a business and they aren't responsible for the value of BTC changing during transactions, you are. 
If BTC appreciated $100 in the same time you wouldn't want your refund in USD and you certainly wouldn't give back the difference.

Relax, you gigantic baby. You said "cutting out CC fees would increase Profit margins by 175% with conservative numbers" as if that's somehow relevant, so excuse me for mentioning it. There may not have been CC fees on those bitcoin transactions but there was some form of processing fee from BitPay, and even a reduced processing fee on those transactions couldn't have possibly contributed 5% to their EPS. 
Now, again, calm down you pathetic baby. Your precious "math" doesn't make any sense and I'm sorry you're so lacking in common sense that you can't grasp how ridiculous Patrick's figures are. 
To help you out a bit more - if cutting out CC fees completely means 175% increase, cutting out 1% of them means a 1.75% increase, not 5%. one quarter of one percent means a .43% increase.  Your math doesn't work. Sorry you're having such trouble grasping this simple concept.

You also seem ignorant of the fact that Bitcoin's current "transaction fee" is being subsidized by the block reward. The current fee (assuming there was no block reward, which there won't be in 20 years) is $13.92
Do you honestly think WU's internal cost-per-transaction is anywhere near $10 each? 
Sorry to break it to you, but Bitcoin isn't at all cheaper than WU, it's just that temporarily the Bitcoin Network is paying miners to process transactions much more than actual users are paying. 
You'll also find WU has little interest in using a money transfer system they can't control. There's absolutely no reason for them to involve bitcoins when they'd be absorbing volatility costs they currently don't have to deal with

If you directly accept Pokemon cards (or Bitcoins) for drugs and then sell those cards (or Bitcoins) for cash as if you just inherited a legal good you're now selling, that's money laundering. You're totally and utterly wrong here buddy. 


Wow, Bitcoin is an internet forum? Now take a guess as to what percentage of total bitcoin transactions these "messages" envelop? It's likely less than a fraction of a fraction of one percent. So small it may as well not exist, which is essentially why the judge is correct in saying Bitcoin is only used for finance. So what if you can use it to send messages, that's not what people primarily use it for, though again that's totally irrelevant. Most people use Pokemon Cards to play Pokemon Cards, but that doesn't preclude them from use as a money laundering substitute. Some companies hoping to create smart contracts are utterly irrelevant as they aren't doing any significant business, at least yet.

I'll lay this out for you as simply as I can - 
Bitcoin is not cheaper than fiat banking. The fees the actual bank pays to send money isn't even close to what the consumer pays. It makes no sense at all to convert from fiat to BTC and back to fiat, you're just wanting the banks to lower their fiat transfer fees in the first place. 
Regulations and consumer protections cost money, that's why fiat transfers cost a bit more. The banks can't pick and choose which transactions are irreversible so everybody pays the same fees, but Bitcoin isn't going to save them any money anyway. 
The current bitcoin transaction fee is $21. You can see for yourself here - 
You don't pay this and neither does your cousin in Africa but somebody will have to pay it when the block reward is 99% mined out in 20 years. Bitcoin runs on charity (the block reward) and that's the only reason it's "cheaper" right now. Miners make 9.7% of their money from this charity and when it's gone they'll be getting their electricity bill money from consumers using Bitcoin with high fees, just like the bank needs fees to pay employees and facilitate safe transfer of money

It sounds nothing like that, and with all due respect I don't think you have any reason to doubt the liability clause refers to the insurer because it specifically refers to all service providers and subcontractors. 


Err, no. They do in fact directly refer to their "service providers" so again I'm not sure why you'd doubt they're equally limited in their liability. 
I'll be frank: You're giving the benefit of the doubt to a company that doesn't deserve it. If this was any fiat bank I'm guessing you'd be willing to "buy" immediately that they so easily limited their own losses while offering "insurance".

Almost none of which offer the option to buy back BTC. Bitcoin ATMs are almost exclusively for buying bitcoins, not selling. And in any event they offer *terrible* market rates

It's not false, though. It's only false if you're talking about volume as a # of transactions.

Not sure why everybody thinks this is an eventuality. 
If BitPay and Coinbase didn't exist (and no substitutes did either) Dell, Newegg, TigerDirect and Expedia wouldn't be accepting Bitcoins. They wouldn't immediately directly accept because the *only* reason they're accepting BTC is another source of fiat. They don't want Bitcoins, they want USD. If ButtonPay existed and allowed button collectors to pay for products using their button collections they would likely accept that as well, they simply want another revenue stream for fiat and have 0 interest in holding or supporting Bitcoins supposed libertarian regime
Now, with a product like Xapo, bitcoin-using patrons are charged additional fees and merchants are charged *the same fees* as customers using fiat-denominated credit cards. There's literally no benefit to the merchant being offered here. 
Now, businesses DO NOT want to take any risk holding BTC, that much is clear. I can't think of any business besides libertarian-run Overstock interesting in holding them. Frankly I don't think there's any reason to all to assume merchants are just going to eventually accept BTC. I suspect a year from now, even five years from now, if merchants are still accepting BTC they'll still be doing it via an intermediary willing to absorb the risk for them. Simply put, merchants can't afford to risk their profits on a cryptocurrency that isn't 100% guaranteed to increase in value, which bitcoin isn't. 


Credit cards will always exist. Even if Bitcoin "hits it big" there will still always be millions out there using fiat and fiat credit cards. It's hyperbole and fantasizing to think otherwise. The best we have now is a bitcoin debit card charging higher fees than fiat debit cards and the same fees to merchants, so I'm not sure where you get off presuming such an inferior product will eventually eliminate a superior competitor. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:42:29
And what about if I want to be paid in Pokemon cards? Or how about in rare stamps? Does the employer jump through hoops to satisfy the couple of employees who want to be paid in some other strange denomination? No, you get paid in USD and you spend that on whatever you want. 
Businesses might hold BTC in the future for some reason, but that reason won't be simply to satisfy their employee requests. You don't take a volatility risk on your profits just because some employee wants you to do a BTC-USD conversion for them. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:10:35

You're right, he isn't going to convert because the merchant will do it for him. Merchants don't hold BTC so they don't have any to pay employees in, and it makes no difference whether the consumer sells or "spends" the Bitcoin right now for most merchants who've "accepted" Bitcoin

You can't honestly compare the two situations. The last block reward halving happened at a time before VC invested millions in Bitcoins, before enormous mining companies invested millions in equipment to extract the block reward. The next halving is occuring in an entirely different era of bitcoin and there's no reason to believe it won't have a profound effect on the bottom line of big mining pools and accordingly on the bottom line of every bitcoin transaction. 
Remember, the block reward accounts for 99.75% of miner revenue. They lose 50% of that 99.75% and either hundreds of people shut down the digital gold rush or people hike up the transaction fees. 
I'm accounting for the growth in transactional volume that bitcoin currently enjoys, that is to say practically none. Over the last year the number of transactions in the network hasn't grown anywhere near the pace it would have to grow to "equally" offset the lost block reward. It's a solution, but not one we're remotely on track enough to consider practical. 
Either the price of a bitcoin skyrockets and miners still get their 99% by minign fractions of a bitcoin or the miners raise transaction fees or they shut down/switch to a more profitable coin, lowering the security of bitcoin. It's going to be a mess for sure, and certainly anything but seamless 
if you're a mining company and you have a $1M electrical bill to mine $1.25M worth of Bitcoin one month and the next month you have a $1M electrical bill to mine $625,000 worth of Bitcoin, you have to get your money from somewhere else or you shut down, and people who have invested millions won't want to be the first to shut down. Nobody wants to be the first to put down their shovel and give up the search for gold and so everybody will try to be last. It will be anything but the graceful free market equilibrium people envision.

I hate to break it to you but it isn't obvious to anybody why a merchant should give away an additional 4% of their revenue. Splitting the processing fee savings is about the most I would ever expect, you're kind of deluding yourself if you think retailers like Newegg or Dell are interested in giving away 4% of their top line to support Bitcoin. 
Companies have sales because they can afford to. What they can't afford to do is give away an additional 10% simply because they saved maybe 1-3% on processing fees. 
Amazon pays ~1.15% credit card processing fees due to their massive volume. Do you really think Amazon is interested in giving away more than 7% of their top line to support some libertarian pseudo-currency used by barely anybody?

Senders *want* the protection of being able to chargeback their purchases. This is not something desirable amongst consumers. 
Now, this might be a shock to you, but merchants only accept CCs and their fees because if they didn't then consumers would shop elsewhere with other merchants that do accept them.

Instead of talking in vague generalizations why don't you tell me what you think I don't understand? Or how sending someone 2 BTC to Africa is anywhere near as convenient as sending somebody the equivalent of 2BTC in actual spendable local cash.

I think you missed the part where 99% of bitcoins will have been mined already less than 20 years from now 


Or, if it isn't more valuable (again, in just 10-20 years), transaction fees will skyrocket. the price of the commodity won't naturally rise as a result of the block reward diminishing, either the price naturally rises and small fractions of BTC are enough to pay miners bills or transaction fees are going to shoot to the moon or people will just stop using Bitcoin altogether for a different coin that hasn't been mined out and hasn't had its difficulty raised to a ridiculous degree

Okay, but at what point do you expect these companies to leave the "security blanket" of 100% fiat conversions? As long as Coinbase/Bitpay are providing an avenue to mitigate the risk of volatility losses, there's literally no reason or benefit for them to directly hold BTC. Shareholders won't accept such volatility so big companies are basically prohibited from doing what you suggest. In fact the *only* large company I can think of that holds any BTC is Overstock, and that's because their CEO has such libertarian ideals. 
Dell and Newegg aren't accepting BTC because they believe fiat is doomed, they are taking advantage of the "bitcoin bump", the small surge of sales and PR blurb associated with accepting. If it were a wise business move, Overstock would be shouting from the rooftops about how much money they've saved accepting and holding BTC. Since the value has declined YTD, you see the CEO quiet as a church mouse about the (negative) effect of holding as a business. 
It's easy to say "yeah someday they'll stop converting" but it's actually incredibly unlikely they'll ever do so given the necessity of risk they're avoiding.

I don't need to offer anything. Look at how much of a flop Bitcoin Black Friday was. Look how little business Overstock is doing since launching acceptance. The proof is in the pudding, my dear. 


Okay but miners currently get 99.7% of their revenue from the block reward and the current transaction cost (paid by the network, check for yourself on blockchain.info) is over $13. So when the block reward vanishes (within 20 years) you'll be paying this transaction fee, minus any difficulty adjustments. I can easily see transactions costing $7-$10 each when there's no block reward offered for mining and companies still have to run massive mining farms

I'm saying they'll stay in business just fine even if they do stiff a few customers out of their BTC losses because A) Nobody can sue them for doing this and B) Losses likely won't occur with such frequency that there will be any kind of uprising. 
When someone gets hacked or otherwise loses BTC, the typical response is "should have had better security". I suspect when Coinbase first actually utilizes their liability limits that affected customer will complain but it simply won't matter enough to the rest of the clientele. Maybe I'm wrong, I can happily admit that, I'm merely trying to explain to people what their actual legal obligations are. When push comes to shove that's really all that matters. 
I appreciate greatly that you can at least conduct a polite discussion on the matter. Wal-Mart stays in business (and is doing quite well, mind you) despite their fairly well known "dead peasant" insurance policies so I propose to you that Coinbase would be just fine following their legal limitations. Affected users will complain, unaffected users will go on about their day.

This isn't really the time or place, but i'll give you a quick one - 
Bitcoin runs on charity. The block reward is the only reason people mine and the block reward is going to essentially have run out completely within 20 years. Currently transaction fees only amount to ~**.5%** of miner's revenue. The gist of this is that Bitcoin is wildly inefficient and when the charity runs out expect transaction fees to hit the roof. There isn't enough volume and the price isn't high enough that anybody could expect transactions to be done in a timely manner for less than $10 each, which obviously isn't competitive. 
Bonus - The entire bitcoin economy is now centralized around BitPay and Coinbase. Without them you immediately lose every major merchant "accepting" BTC, and with BitPay and Coinbase mitigating volatility risk there's never going to be a day where Dell or Microsoft decide to directly accept into their own wallet. Allowing comapnies like Coinbase and BitPay to exist was a big nail in the coffin for Bitcoin, ironically. It was a middleman in a currency literally created to cut out middlemen. It's a trust requirement in a currency created to be trustless.

It's funny that you equate his analogy as his entire understanding of bitcoins. 
Let me clarify this for you
Bitcoins *are* like a chequebook. There is only 21 million cheques to use and you can buy a piece of one for a certain amount. Both bitcoins and cheques send money, but, as he clearly explained, the big joke is that Bitcoins are "scarce" without actually being scarce. There's no limit to the number of cheques in the chequebook, only for the Bitcoin chequebook. The WarrenBuffetCoin chequebook could have an infinite number of units and he wouldn't be commanding a high price per cheque because of some stupid artificial scarcity you're so happy to indulge yourself in despite the rest of the world ignoring the value of this scarcity and that being reflected in the price. 
Warren Buffet is a fuck of a lot smarter than you are, and that's exhibited by the very fact you can't understand his simple analogy and even further by the fact that you're one of the people he's laughing at for buying into this scheme.
I'm prepared for a good 10-15 downvotes. I've lost something like 600 karma over the last couple of days because people are getting desperately angry about the "trolls" and people like Warren Buffet being right. This confidence game is getting pretty scarce for new dumb money

Not if volatility is something you aren't interested in risking, which is what we're talking about. By your logic it's already cheaper to pay Newegg's suppliers in Bitcoin (cheaper than wire transfer, right?) and their suppliers could probably even use BitPay. But then we've accomplished nothing and their supplier still converts. 
You didn't propose an argument or a good reason one might actually take the risk you mentioned, you just made another big "but what if magically this happens - "
The incentive is there, the problem is Bitcoins. Too unstable to hold, and easy options exist to avoid necessitating the holding. I don't see what's going to break this cycle, what supplier is risky enough to accept BTC and not immediately sell them. 


Not necessarily. Perhaps you could save some money on transfers by simply buying the BTC you need and immediately selling it, vice-versa for the supplier. It's usable but still totally pushing the price down.

Somebody alert r/buttcoin. Overstock apparently suffers from the same payment-processor woes that Bitcoin proponents constantly yammer on about.
Great, informative post, and actually quite funny. Makes a lot of sense for Byrne to use the weekday income and not an actual monthly average since that would take it from $15,000 a day to about $10,000 a day. 
edit - I just noticed the thread title includes the word "averaging". I checked the interview to see if he actually used the word and sure enough
"The average daily sales clip has now reached $15,000 a day, or $300,0000 per month, he said"
Seems frankly ridiculous to say average daily sales and not mean (monthly sales / 30). They're still making sales on the weekends and it's irrelevant whether or not their payment processor has finalized the transaction and paid out by then, it's still a sale. I think it's safe to conclude that you're right, he's talking about $15,000 per weekday to get the $300k figure and their *actual* average daily BTC sales are $10,000

Can you tell me how much the price has risen since Dell's acceptance? I think you'll find you've again made the same mistake of drawing conclusions based on flimsy "truths" you've created yourself. 


Again, no, it doesn't. It just tells us that a significant part of the economy tanking won't necessarily affect the price. There are plenty of other drug markets, after all. 


Ahaha. You mean they announced they dropped from 1% of their business in BTC to less than 1/4 of 1%? 
BitPay and CoinBase doing well sounds like a lot of people selling BTC for cash. After all, nearly no retailers actually hold BTC, the aforementioned Dell certainly doesn't. 
...You realize intermediaries like BitPay and CoinBase were not only one of the things Bitcoin was supposed to remove but also drive down the price? Yeah, $1M/day of people selling their BTC for cash sounds great! 
And as one last laugh from your post - here's your amazing transaction volume - basically unchanged over the past year. There were actually many more transactions (in USD) a year ago than there are now. 
And another chart showing a totally stagnant transaction volume:
Completely stagnant growth over a full year sounds like minute activity to me. 
Allow me to simplify this for you - You can tell that your assumptions about contributors to price are nonsense because your assumption that Dell willing to accept makes Bitcoin more valuable is false. SR2 going down without totally collapsing Bitcoin doesn't mean anything at all. Sorry.

Could it be that bitcoiners are praying for the value to rise based on whatever bullshit they can use to convince others to pay more? Wall St. money is coming, bitcoins are scarce valuable units and eventually the whole world will smarten up and use BTC. Hop on now before they are all $100k!

I can sure try. 
If there was only 10 BTC left in the world and we were somehow obligated to use BTC we would likely have to pay this owner billions upon billions for each BTC. Then all of France's commerce would be operating on fractions of a BTC and the guy who owns the last 9 BTC in the world would likely be the richest person in existence. 
This whole premise is based on a *need* to use Bitcoins. No need actually exists. Essentially the whole idea is that as Bitcoins are lost people will pay more and more to the people who already own Bitcoin. This means they automatically are worth more and more simply because someone else lost theirs when realistically there is absolutely no reason to pay more for Bitcoins. Bitcoins aren't rare. There may be only 21 million "Bitcoins" but there is an infinite amount of other "bitcoin" cryptocurrency units out there
Data isn't scarce. Bitcoins are only artifcially scarce and the world simply won't be conned into paying ever-increasing amounts for an artificially scarce digital unit when alternatives exist.

You actually don't know this for sure at all, though certainly you hope it's true. I've seen little indication that there's a high demand for Bitcoins among "big money" Wall streeters. They could have bought at $350 and didn't, so why now?

This isn't a short-lived sale we're talking about. The OP suggested retailers could save 2-4% by accepting Bitcoin but then should also offer 10% discounts, so you'd have a Bitcoin-payment discount on top of whatever other discounts they are offering. 


Think a little bit more ahead here - Sign a new customer, lose money providing a discount to that customer...then what? You either keep offering them a discount that loses you money or you abandon the sale and the customer has no incentive to shop with you anymore. 
You're literally suggesting merchants offer up their revenues as charity to endorse and support Bitcoin. 


And simple math dictates that offering 10% off when using a payment method that saves 3% is in fact losing profitability.

You'll also shop with a ton of retailers who don't really accept BTC but instead take cash and have Coinbase or BitPay sell your BTC for them. 
Your goal is going to be a failure before you even begin. You'll die of starvation and exposure before you find both a grocery store and a landlord willing to directly accept Bitcoins. If you're okay compromising on your ideals and cashing out to fiat in order to make most of your purchases what's the point in the first place? 
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:40:39


I'm well aware of that, I'm simply stating what the typical bitcoiner response is when a fellow user suffers a loss. Let's say Coinbase deletes their wallet and loses thousands of Bitcoins. Their policy may only entitle them to a few hundred Bitcoins as a replacement (bear with me here). 
You don't get back 100% of your BTC regardless of whether or not Coinbase wants to "do the right thing" because the BTC simply aren't there to be disbursed. So they fall back on their legal obligations - 3 months worth of service fees to customers. Maybe the rest of the insurance payout goes towards bankruptcy costs, who knows - in any event they may not repay 100% of users 100% of their funds. Whether it's because they have the legal backing to do so or the funds simply aren't there, they've covered their ass to only repay a small amount. 
One guy posting on reddit about how Coinbase fucked him over isn't going to be enough to make everybody leave Coinbase. Dozens of people posting on reddit about how Coinbase fucked them over may not be enough. I've said from the beginning that I agree it's the "moral" thing to do, but morality has little place in business and, as you've agreed, they've legally covered themselves to only be liable for a small portion of holdings. 
The point of the "dead peasant" insurance is that it's obviously immoral to take out life insurance policies and not share any of the proceeds with family of the deceased, and yet Walmart does this every day of the year and manages to stay in business. These aren't valuable, irreplaceable employees, these are entry-level stock clerks and cashiers. This "immoral" business practice isn't enough to sink the largest retailer in the world, I suspect similarly shady business practices won't be enough to sink Coinbase should they make the decision to reimburse users according to their legal obligations and not the kindness of their heart

This is such an elementary understanding of economic principles I can't even begin to explain how wrong it is. Low supply of bitcoins doesn't matter if there's no demand for them, Newegg doesn't have demand for Bitcoins they have demand for USD via whatever avenue they can receive them. 
If you "hodl" a large amount and never spend them, the world will never see the usefulness of BTC as a currency and demand will never grow to outpace supply, thus the price will never skyrocket. 
If there was only 10 BTC left in the world do you think everybody would be fighting over the last 10 BTC (worth a billion trillion dollars each) or do you think they'd just use a more widely-available cryptocurrency? A limited supply of bitcoins only means deflationary growth if that limited supply of bitcoins is actually exhausted and in use. Bitcoins are only artificially and arbitrarily scarce, there's nothing guaranteeing people won't simply use a different cryptocurrency and in fact some altcoins have implemented measures to make sure coins actually get used. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:36:40


There won't ever be a fork to change Bitcoin's 21M Bitcoins. Too many people are invested in deflation occuring and owning their particular piece of the planned pie. 


Yes, the idea of capitalism is that the consumer wins. What I'm saying is that Bitcoin isn't planned efficiently enough to survive long-term. Bitcoin specifically, not necessarily any and all cryptocurrencies. 


Carrier pigeons are another method of transferring messages but they are woefully inefficient. 


This simply isn't true. Bitcoin is now dependent on Coinbase and Bitpay for retail survival. Nobody knows how Coinbase and BitPay run their business and it's not certain how long their business model of take bitcoins sell for cash can survive. If it does what you end up with is still a cryptocurrency dependent on a third-party it was created to avoid. Great.

You're talking nonsense at this point. Merchants dumping BTC pushes the price **down**. It also displays an utter lack of faith in the currency. 
There's at most a semantic difference between "I don't want these" and "I don't want these right now. Maybe later, maybe not". In any event the merchant doesn't want to retain any BTC. But that's a good thing, right? What a joke.

This interview is driving me nuts. 


$15,000 per day is a lot more than $300,000 per month. So that's one thing


So it's been eight months so far in 2014 and we're talking about $2M in sales. How in the world does he anticipate $8M in total sales for 2014 if the year is 75% over and we're about 25% of the way there? Strange. 
Here's another link to (I think) the same interview, from Reuters


This is a bizarre way for a CEO to talk. What "the world expects" is irrelevant, when you're talking EPS you're talking about what your shareholders expect, and they expect something because you told them that. So is EPS 75 cents this quarter? Why not just say that? He frames his statement in a vague manner, and then relates a figure to bitcoin based on that vague statement. Not saying there's anything incorrect about this statement, just that it's worded strangely. 
I'm also skeptical that he's getting 5% of his EPS from Bitcoin, which actually only contributes one quarter of one percent of his sales. The numbers just don't make sense, he isn't saving that much on processing fees. Then again, this isn't an official report, so he can say what he wants, it may not be accurate when it comes to paper. 
Finally - 


In this case Byrne has some pretty unrealistic expectations. Minutes ago he mentioned Bitcoin sales were roughly $300,000 per month, I don't see bitcoin sales jumping 300% (*maybe* for Christmas, temporarily) but it's a pretty ridiculous assumption that Bitcoin sales are going to go from roughly 1% of total sales to 1/4 of 1% and then suddenly surge again 300+%.

Can you define "trolling" for me ? I'm getting the strong impression that anybody you disagree with however valid their opinions is being called a "troll" , and that's not what the word means. I've been saying for months that the price is probably heading downwards , not to 0 , not that Bitcoin is dead and worthless , but the price did end up going down and all of the problems I've ever discussed still exist , so why are my concerns "trolling" ? Because you don't like what you're hearing isn't a good answer. 
People with differing Opinions and viewpoints bring a valuable discussion to the table and you're an ignorant fool for disregarding everything as "trolling" and even stupider for boasting about known paid trolls without offering a shred of proof.

You didn't say "about half" though, you said "half the bitcoins haven't even been mined yet", that's a definitive statement indicating less than 50% have been mined. In actuality we passed 50% a while ago. Is 61% "about half"? It's 20% more than half, that's not "about half" for most people. You don't have to be so condescending about it, son. People make mistakes, it's okay to admit them, you don't have to act like you didn't actually make one by confusing 61% with less than 50%


No. 39% is up for grabs, which again is pretty far from half. More than 20% less than half. When we're talking about millions of dollars worth of an asset 61% is miles away from 50%.

There are exceptions to every rule. A nearly 33% off one-time sale doesn't necessarily mean that in general Bitcoiners don't spend very little.

And why would a supplier magically take BTC? Their merchants don't accept it. Overstock can already pay a supplier in BTC - Dell. Dell dumps their BTC before they even hold it. Your logic is just flawed. If the merchants don't take it, why would their suppliers start? Everybody is just going to convert forever because they can and because it's safe. 
Since Overstock started holding BTC, their 10% in holdings has been cut by 40%. There's isn't a big "holding bitcoin is good!" news story right now to convince neither merchants nor suppliers its worth holding.

It certainly should be your concern if your goal is to live off Bitcoins exclusively because you'd be shopping at a retailer that never actually touches Bitcoins. If BitPay didn't sell them and give them USD they would never "accept" your BTC in the first place so I propose shopping with retailers who's only goal is to sell your BTC is both a bastardization of your ideals and counter-productive, but go on and sell yourself out just so you can actually use your BTC somewhere, I don't blame you, but don't act like you're operating without the fiat banking system because you absolutely are not.

Bitcoin is indeed supposed to be its own full-fledged currency, used by people for every kind of commerce. Imagine how little utility the Euro would have it every retailer, worldwide, immediately sold it rather than used it.

I don't think you have any idea how to run a business so I'll just wish you good luck at this point. I think you'll find very soon there simply aren't enough people spending bitcoins to sustain your business.

Bitcoin can save retailers anywhere from 2-3%. Retailers don't save money just to give it away, so the best you should hope for would be splitting the profit and maybe getting a 1% discount. Since a 1% discount is so paltry it may as well not be there, merchants will more likely just keep all the savings. 
Merchants would be losing money giving you a 10% discount, and they have no reason to offer such a large discount to the 2 or 3 people that use Bitcoin at their store.

Actually I know what they do and how they do it because you've explained it over and over without actually realizing this has been possible for decades already and there's no demand for it for a litany of reasons that have already been explained to you but you're too ignorant to understand or comprehend. 
Let me summarize for you before I bow out - 
companies earn interest on their savings, including payroll. Paying every few weeks means they make more interest. 
Companies submit taxes when making payments. They can't be doing this every second, or every minute. Even when automated, it's just too much paperwork. Computers don't handle everything, accountants still have to make records. The government doesn't even *want* you to make payments this often because it's a hassle for them too. 
Finally, most people understand regular payment schedules and can plan accordingly. If you owe a bill today, you didn't just hear about it today. That's why bills have future payment dates. If you absolutely need cash immediately, employers can offer a cash advance. 
Again, what you're talking about has been possible with legacy payment systems for decades. They don't do it for several reasons, which you can read over and over (above) until you grasp these difficult concepts. 
Cheers buddy.

Yes Coinbase makes good money on conversions, but they don't make so much that they can afford to reimburse all their users for all their lost bitcoins. 


So, follow along with me here, User incurs a loss, Coinbase is eligible to receive full compensation but User is liability-limited to what's in the ToS. According to that ToS, Users aren't entitled to any more compensation than three months worth of service fees and also agree not to sue anyway. 
You're essentially agreeing with me here. Coinbase may have insurance, but they won't be paying (or at least legally obliged to pay) 100% of claims to their actual owners

At what point, exactly? If merchants can take absolutely 0 risk now with regards to volatility, why would they ever start? They already benefit from lower processing fees via BitPay or Coinbase without risking their profits to volatility, and Overstock has lost a good chunk of whatever sales they kept in BTC this year. 
It's common to hear "someday merchants will stop selling" but I don't see why they would. So long as you can safely cash out they will, and since they cash out they don't have any spare BTC to pay suppliers (who might cash out anyway) or employees

You might notice this makes no specific reference to the amount of the insurance. Your 100 BTC are "insured"...for $100. 


Did you forget you've waived your right to sue? 


Yes, it does. Just because you want to pretend "subcontractor" or "service provider" couldn't possibly mean "insurance" doesn't make it so. 


You still haven't been able to name a single contradictory statement. Again, nothing about this is unclear to me nor should it be unclear to anybody who can interpret English. 


I honestly don't know why I bothered to furnish this for you as no doubt you'll find something you interpret as "unclear" here, but you might notice some very similar writing which is, again, completely commonplace. You have 0 reason to doubt that what is written below will cover their insurers because this is written by people obviously much smarter than yourself with the express purpose of relieving companies of actually making large liability payments. But I digress....


Now go on, give Circle the benefit of the doubt and assume what you read above doesn't say exactly what it obviously says. 


Likewise. It's difficult to converse with somebody who has trouble understanding simple terms of service. 
Let me end this with a simple summary for you, which you're free to verify with both Circle or Xapo to ease your doubtful little mind:




This means everybody. Insurers, agents, employees, EVERYBODY. Do you understand that simple truth yet? 
Now, since I've done you some favors: Find me specifically and exactly where in their Terms you feel they exclude their insurer from the aforementioned parties, or for what reason you feel the insurer would not fall under a "service provider" to the company because for me this is clear as day and your downvotes seem to indicate everybody else here is equally capable of understanding what this means.

Well the price can't fall without someone selling so that's kind of obvious. What we're talking about here, apparently what went way over your head, is that holding bitcoins in no way guarantees the price will rise. It isn't as simple as holding  = more valuable. For as many people as were selling last year there were plenty of holders and they weren't able to hold the price at the same level. 


I don't know why you're acting condescending when you yourself are apparently having trouble grasping that holding != higher prices
Let's try to simplify this:




Prove this. Somehow. I know a ton of people who did nothing but hold bitcoins in 2014 and the value went down. How do you know holding drives the prices up? Do you have any evidence at all of this?

To answer you concisely I feel if things were happening so much only on the back-end that people don't even know they're using Bitcoins they likely won't be using Bitcoins but something like Western Union coins or PayPal Coins. If cryptocurrencies can prove a more efficient method of transfer than existing systems I don't see why companies can't simply create their own and harness the savings for themselves without investing into a six-year old 50+% mined currency they have no control over. 
It's never made sense for any company to adopt Bitcoins in any real fashion for this reason. It's too easy and cheap to make your own coin and no regular consumer gives a shit about decentralization or the crookedness of the USD or what fees their merchant is paying to sell them a TV. 
You seem bright, though. Keep your eyes open, far too many people here are too consumed with bias to honestly consider a criticism when they hear it, unfortunately. I've got people who predicted Bitcoins would be worth $5000 by now *still* calling me an idiot for having predicted they'd be worth $250 by now and that insist the USD is on the verge of collapse.

If you really believe this to be true then Bitcoins will be dropping to $0. There's no way people are going to pay $1000-$2000 per coin simply because the market cap is inhibited by some **artificial** supply limit. 
If $100 Bitcoiins are a problem because they don't facilitate enough commerce (even though $100 Bitcoins would be plenty for today's BTC commerce) then perhaps more Bitcoins should be made. The world won't be fooled into paying exorbitant prices per bitcoin simply because of a fake limit on them.

Most companies don't keep bitcoins, in fact most companies never receive them at all.

Is it supposed to be difficult to find a rebuttal?
Again, it's a 90% loss, I don't know why you seem to be insinuating I don't understand what a percentage is. A 90% loss of $10,000 in 2011 represents a much higher number of Bitcoins than a loss of 90% of a $10,000 investment in Bitcoins made in 2014...

Both attitudes aren't cancerous. One is promising ridiculous riches for an investment, the other is discouraging the idiocy. 
Have some more examples - 




Don put your fiat anymore in pension funds. HODL and later you will have for your retirement a fortune!
Don't put your fiat in your child savings account for studies, save in a btc wallet and later your child can go to the best university paid in BTC...
Focus on adoption not on today's price.
Think how much goods you can buy in 4-5 years with BTC
There's nothing harmful about saying "be skeptical", there *is* something harmful about conning people out of their money in order to make your own holdings worth more. The people encouraging you to HODL bitcoins vs. pay into a pension are infinitely more toxic to this community.

What does this have to do with anything? Bitcoin has been around six years now and may already have reached market saturation, you can't excuse Bitcoin's problems with immaturity anymore (or rather you can but it's a pathetic excuse when used alongside all the "Bitcoin is going to end the USD" bullshit you see here)

Just to give you some numbers to work with fortyfour -


This "Cost per transaction" is the cost per bitcoin transaction when you include the block reward and tx fees. Currently tx fees make only .47% of miner's total revenue so if the block reward were gone tomorrow trasnaction fees would have to rise 200x just to make miners the same money they are making now. 
Obviously difficulty may eventually drop or volume may rise but if things don't change we're likely looking at 10$ transaction fees just for miners to lose like 90% of their revenue today. It's an ugly situation.

Basically, the same customers that aren't showing up now are shopping at different restaurants because there is an increased awareness of healthy eating in modern society. It's not because fiat is a cumbersome method of payment or because it isn't interesting enough to pay in fiat. Bitcoin is going to do nothing to help them.

**Both these statements you said mean the same thing**. People delay their purchases because it becomes more valuable. They are proving this is true by currently delaying their purchases at a point where the price is low.

How about you explain how I'm wrong rather than just whine "troll"? It's much easier to just cry that I'm trolling rather than try to explain how data is somehow scarce or limited, isn't it?
There is an actually limited amount of oil on this earth. If output of an actually-scarce resource was halved then obviously the price would rise. Bitcoin isn't so cut-and-dry. The scarcity of bitcoins is something you have to believe, something you have to convince the average person to care about. In reality, and you can't deny this, Bitcoin is like every other altcoin. They're all just cryptocurrencies, there's no actual limit to cryptocurrencies in the world. The world's financial markets are in no way dependent on Bitcoin like they are on oil and if Bitcoins were to go away completely tomorrow the exact same function could be achieved by an altcoin. 
Don't just cry troll, it's rather pathetic. I've never trolled here, I don't post contrarian opinions just for kicks nor do I concern troll, I'm talking about actual economic factors and you're just putting your fingers in your ear when you realize your analogy makes no sense to Average Joe.

I know you think you're clever and all but Overstock, Dell and every other BTC-accepting retailer have seen a sharp decline in sales since the BTC price fell. The part you quoted is honestly economics 101. 
People buy a cell phone now rather than six months from now because they want instant gratification. If you have both USD and bitcoin, you're obviously less likely to spend your bitcoin when the price is low than the USD, you can (potentially) spend the same amount of bitcoins in the future to get more goods. 


I like the part where you think you disproved fundamental economic theories with anecdotes about cars and cell phones. Ask Patrick Byrne for evidence, or the CEO of any bitcoin-accepting company.
edit - to take it a bit further - 


You totally missed the point here. Some people do defer purchases because of technological advancements but that is on the product side and not the currency side. With bitcoins deferred spending means you're getting better technology down the line for cheaper *and* you have increased purchasing power. Try and absorb something here, okay?

It's the same *percentage*, yes I understand that, but it's not nearly the same money and thus not **the exact same thing**
Remind me to never bother treating you with a modicum of respect in the future, you don't deserve it. You're a disingenuous little idiot like the rest of the people here and I'm a fool for mistaking you for being nearly intelligent.

Err, no, all you're doing is phrasing the exact same thing converted to Bitcoin prices. It doesn't matter whether you say the cost of an item in BTC has gone down or "you have increased purchasing power" - they are literally the same thing. 
Nothing is priced in Bitcoin. Not a single product on Overstock or Dell or Newegg's webpages. It's all a USD amount converted to Bitcoin on the spot, so your comment is really pointless.

Yeah, my point is these aren't *the exact same thing*. They represent a very different number of Bitcoins. 
Or were you saying losing 30 BTC is "the exact same thing" as 300 BTC? 
You made an honest mistake, you know very well we're talking about sums that aren't "the exact same thing" but you're apparently so stubborn you're going to keep arguing and changing denominations thinking that somehow makes you right? 
Let's try again!
I have $300 in CAD in one bank account and $3000 in another. I lose 90% of my money in both accounts. THESE ARE STILL NOT THE EXACT SAME THING. Notice how changing denominations doesn't help? It's because you can't possibly explain this in a way where you aren't just putting your foot deeper in your mouth. You can continue to be disingenuous and stubborn but it's just losing you respect and further embarrassing yourself. 
Give it a shot again though pal, maybe if you lose 90% of a 1L can of corn it would be the same amount of corn as 90% of a 10L can. Oh shucks that didn't work either.

While I was waiting for my 10-min timeout to pass I looked up another interesting statistic - more people "invested" in an HD-DVD player than have bought Bitcoins

You sure didn't let me down.


It's like you're so lacking in self-awareness you don't even realize you're proving yourself wrong. The fact that pools exist at all obviously indicates some type of centralization, the fact that two pools combined make up 48% of the hashing power is more proof. 


And many of those individual miners are focusing their power between two centralized powers that control a combined 48%. Again, it's hilariously ironic that you don't even realize you're proving my point while hurling grade-school insults nobody has been insulted by since the early 00's.

You're a smart guy, I know you are. 
Bitcoins didn't cost anywhere near $900 each in 2012 or 2011. Don't play stupid and call it "the exact same situation". VC investment into bitcoin in 2011 and 2012 COMBINED was a pittance compared to VC investment in 2013 or 2014. You lose 90% of Bitcoins value in 2011 or 2012 and the difference was either less than a cup of coffee or a decent meal out. Now losing 90% is equivalent to a car payment or new computer. 
90% of $30 isn't "the exact same" as 90% of $1100 or $900.
I'd call you naive but I know you aren't so just stop being disingenuous mmmkay?

The transaction fees will rise significantly in order to raise the same revenue that the block reward is currently providing.
If there was no more block reward *today*, and miners were making the same money they are now, each transaction would cost an average of $32.72 in fees
Cost Per Transaction 	$32.72
Transactions may be delayed so they can be grouped to save on these fees, or they may occur off-blockchain. If fees aren't enough to pay electrical bills, some miners will shut down

A lot of companies have profit margins leaner than 10%. I'm guessing you're pretty new at business school. 
Getting $90 out of $100 might mean a loss of $6. You need to be at or around 1% to compete in this space, Coinbase and BitPay essentially do what you're offering for that price or less. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:38:40


You want to be both the marketplace and payment processor, but that doesn't mean you don't have to be competitive with companies that are just payment processors. The clients you want to have all have their own marketplace (website) anyway. 


No. I told you, you have to be at or below 1% to be competitive at all. Even though Bitpay and Coinbase will just eat you up. 


You can't have a baseline expense that is more than your competitors can offer as a rate. If Paypal costs you 3% then maybe bank transfers are cheaper in the end, but either way that's totally unacceptable.

No, there isn't always a plea bargain available. For example , Ross wasn't offered one. What in the world makes you think there's always a deal ? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:14:25


"Digital" and "scarce" are typically mutually exclusive. Again, you may as well be saying CD-Keys and emails are rare. 
Bitcoins are just one of an infinite number of other cryptocoins, they are non-proprietary, which means you can have an infinite number of alternative or competing cryptocurrencies. There may be only 21 million **Bitcoins** but that doesn't mean there aren't infinite **bitcoins**. 
When you talk about something *programmed to be scarce*, that's not real scarcity - that's artificial scarcity. Gold isn't valuable because of some superficial (read: false) artificial scarcity, gold has real-world inherent scarcity. The difference is one of them is actually rare and one of them is only designed to be so. 
Again, the masses will never value digital scarcity. Nobody ever tried to convince other people that emails were rare and scarce because they are non-proprietary. 
Good luck with your quest, Bitcoins won't likely ever be worth $1000+ again let alone a laughable $88,888 but don't let me stomp all over your fantasies. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:02:55


It isn't like this *at all*. Selling large amounts of Bitcoins locally likely means the seller needs a license to be a money transmitter.

@_date: 2015-02-03 23:07:36


You're confused. If he plead guilty, he would have moved on to sentencing. A bargain means a deal, something the prosecution offers you in exchange for a guilty plea. If they have nothing to offer or otherwise don't want to (like they do here), they just offer nothing. Either the defendent pleads guilty and faces sentencing or doesn't plead guilty and goes to court. 
In short, it's not called a "plea bargain" if you plead guilty because they don't have to bargain with anything, they just accept the plea. 
Ask a real lawyer if you don't believe me but you're wrong here. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:46:28
I'm telling you, as a fact, there was no plea offered. The prosecution *wants to take this to court*, and they want to make an example out of Ross. There was **no plea bargain offered**

No, you aren't. Your argument has some major flaws, among it the fact that the Average American Joe doesn't think Bitcoins are scarce at all. Gold is actually scarce, bitcoins are digital. They don't physically exist, and there's no real limit to data, so how do you expect people to "buy in" to Bitcoin's scarcity?
You may as well be trying to convince people that emails are scarce

Hmm, yes, the absolutely pedantic little "wrongs" you've pointed out are the equivalent of "fumbling around". I sure hope you continue to stalk me online and look for any typos you can point out, hopefully that satisfies your pathetic existence. 
It's quite apparent that was no "breakout" anyway, so I think you'll have to delay your little jerkoff session on this last one
Of course you want to shy away from the fact that I've been big-picture right about Bitcoin from day 1, but don't let me stop you from jacking off behind your keyboard about that one time I thought I sent you a message before you sent me one, boy that was incredible.

Except they are trading Bitcoins and affecting the price of the Bitcoins you own...so it has a lot to do with Bitcoins.

People defer spending with the idea that the currency will be worth more in the future, that's the whole problem with deflation. While i understand that Bitcoin is currently inflationary, people are still deferring spending because Bitcoin has declined in value, imitating the effects of deflation

You'd be underwater the first time bitcoin drops in price before you had a chance to cash it out and pay the merchants. If the price drops 1% before you pay them you've lost your profit, if the price drops any more you're losing money.
