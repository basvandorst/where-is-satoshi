Futures getting shorted consecutively doesn't amount to much profit margin.  It's best if the oscillation is wide.  Wall street profits better if the next futures goes beyond estimated price point.

Most blue, white collar jobs come back on Wednesday here in the U.S. (Tuesday is considered holiday pay).  Once people get back to work, that’s when the price of bitcoin should start to rise.  Taxes get filed in mid Feb.  there’s a reason ethereum took off around March/April; people got their tax return money.

Who cares?  Regardless of userbase, if the technology is flawed, or not what the evolution of currency is, it's only a matter of time before the true champion coin gets to that  position.  Most people who use facebook use it not to buy stuff or transact money, they do it to keep in touch with those they know.  Making fiat into digital isn't crypto if it's still rooted in a national dollar.

In a way, it's good for these financial analysts to publicly write what they think.  You can look down the line on exactly how wrong they were, and how they could have joined the revolution at its earliest stages.  
What will be even more interesting is to watch those same analysts who embraced the blockchain technology and fully adapt, making them way ahead of their competition while those that didn't embrace the revolution.  They will be jobless just like blockbuster videos who had a chance to purchase netflix early on.

If you think about it, the ones that buy now (Especially new money/new investors) are the real geniuses of the financial game.

The increase of price is mostly due to recent events (Japan's approval of bitcoin, the re-evaluation of the bitcoin ETF).  No doubt bitcoin's value would skyrocket upon the activation of segwit, but there's too many that oppose the upgrade due to various reasons.  Your best bet for the continuous increase in bitcoin value is with the gained acceptance from different countries and the convergence of financial entities to use the blockchain technology.  
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:50:58
I've made money trading coins by using the Stop limit Sell,, combined by reading constantly about coins and their upgrades (could be LBRY's IO, Bitcoin's segwit or Strat's Breeze).  Cryptocurrency is heavily swayed by news.  If you have a plan (grow a coin 5% per trade) and follow it, and also don't in any way be greedy, you can really make some money.  
Also, you must have multiple coins trading (5-10 minimum) so you don't get stuck HODLing till even or profit with just 1 coin.
There's a huge advantage trading coins compared to stocks.  No broker fees, as many trades as you want, and is not ruled by banking hours are a few examples.  
Now, I will have to disagree with OP.  When you are not trading, it's best to keep all in coins that move little per day such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ripple.
