Yeah. The highest price bitcoin I bought was $960. First I bought was about $960, in fall 2013, before Empty-Gox. Bought and hodl all the way down to $188 and all the way back up to $927. I feel for those that bought above this point but my sentiment remains unchanged: HODL!, never invest what you can't afford to lose, and just chill. Wait it out, in a year or two or even a month or two, you'll be glad you did.

When bitcoin becomes more commonplace, I expect prices will be better. Credit card companies charge 3% for transactions, which they basically just roll into the price. 
So right away, there's a potential of about 3% savings. 
For low price transactions, the potential isn't as enticing, but for large transactions, it'll be quite worthwhile.

Yes. Probably not a whole BTC, but maybe a hundred mBTC   (miliBitcoin, I'll use that for the examples. 1BTC=1000mBTC). For example, if you converted 1000mBTC to USD at a price of $700, then the price went down to $500, that $700 would buy you 1400mBTC. So you would gain 400mBTC. It's a gamble though. This is what many people use BTC-e.com to do. They buy and sell Bitcoin and Altcoins sometimes profiting, sometimes losing.

PCI-DSS was created by credit card companies, not federal law. Just because they mandate it doesn't mean the credit card networks wouldn't require it without. 
The law can be a deterrent, but it is not protection. 40% of all financial fraud is credit card fraud. 10% of Americans have been victims of credit card fraud and 7% debit and atm card fraud.

The 10% fractional reserve requirement is, in my opinion, the absolute core of the problem. It allows those with money, to profit off of money that doesn't exist, while the people without money, have to pay to that profit in interest. 
The monopoly on the creation of money given to the Fed by the gov, the endless "printing" by the Fed and the endless debt creation, are all branches from this corrupt core. 
I believe that sound money would most certainly reverse the flow of money, or at least stop the constant flow from the bottom to the top.

One thing to remember is that the market rate is just what you would get if you were to sell it. It's still worth the same BTC, but the amount of dollars you can sell it for has gone down. It could go down more or it could go back up. If you don't want to sell, the current drop in price isn't really even an issue. If you were to think it's headed down, you could sell now then buy back at a lower price, or buy more BTC for the money you sold at. But if it goes up, you could lose. I'm thinking it could go down more but will ultimately go back up higher so I'm just gonna hold mine. (Actually I've been using this price dip to buy more).

On that note, it makes sense to allow it to deal with the highly inflationary US dollar reserve currency skimming off the top of their trades.

I don't think he's making fun but pointing out that it's clearly not an accidental visit to a site. There's no deniability or thinking that what they were doing was somehow a misunderstanding of the rules. This was clearly not acceptable workplace behavior. 
The point is that these people have no respect for the rules and policies of their workplace let alone the taxpayers financing their misdeeds, so why should they be trusted to regulate your money. 
It's not attacking regulation in general, but government regulation. He's attacking government in general. He's attacking the idea that people that are corrupt are magically supposed to be able to protect us from people that are corrupt. The untrustworthy boogey-man vs the untrustworthy boogey-man with the force of government.These people are to be trusted to stand up against corruption? 
The point is, government regulation and intervention cause more problems than they solve and do so at the expense of the taxpayers and (because of the dollar reserve currency) in the case of the US, at the expense of the world. (because we "export" our inflation by devaluing the medium of exchange that they are using to trade with us.)

Judging by your downvotes, people here are clueless. 
For those that don't understand, inflation penalizes those that save, unless you can afford to save in a way to hedge inflation. The poor and middle class can't afford to lock their savings away in investments that beat inflation because they have to have access to their money, so the best they can do is a savings account, which loses value to inflation. This inhibits saving and without saving, when they need to buy something expensive, they have to buy it on credit, which means they are having to pay interest. It's a constant trickle from the bottom to the top.

I think you aren’t aware what a coinstar machine is. It’s a kiosk which the primary purpose is to exchange coins. People take their spare change bins and turn it in for cash or vouchers.

It's joining Gold as a safe haven, not replacing it. There are distinct advantages to both.
Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. It may not be perfect, but it's not going away for a long time. 
Bitcoin can be carried in your brain, on a piece of paper, in a text message, in a digital wallet, or hardware wallet. Gold can't do that. 
I have bitcoin I hold as a safe haven investment, but I also hold gold, silver and cash fraudulent reserve notes, as well as other investments. I am of the opinion that my BTC will greatly outperform my other investments, but I still think it's a good idea to stay diversified.
