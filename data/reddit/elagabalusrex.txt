That's because you got redirected to the Welsh site, moron.

What's the fastest way to download the blockchain? Should I use only the client's connection, or is it safe to download a massive file from a website?

Did they finally arrest the CEO of Bitcoin?

It's a fascinating question, but irrelevant, as others have pointed out. Currencies can't be instantly devalued. I honestly don't know what would happen if every dollar holder suddenly came into possession of a proportionally massive amount of money. If we were unable to use fiat at all, then the BTC price would be unchanged, because there would be no reason why a pizza would become more valuable in the fiatless world. However, if fiat still exists but is extremely devalued (a much more realistic scenario), then the fact that people exchange between BTC and USD would definitely create a huge effect in the Bitcoin world. How we would then determine the value of these post-crash Bitcoins, we cannot predict.

This is what happens when good people pool together their money.

My friend pirateat40 can make that cake even better
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:20:31
Impossible. Bitcoin will never exceed $11 after what happened with pirateat40.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:43:50
Bitcoin will never reach $11 dollars again. pirateat40 scared everyone off.

Dogemetal is a serious currency.

Because "muh 51 percent".

Hey, I remember Mt. Gox! They're the ones who ended my foray into Bitcoin!

It was inevitable. The real bitcoin client is just too abstract and cumbersome for mainstream use. Ordinary people don't want ot be bothered with Bitcoin the Protocol when they really want Bitcoin the Currency.
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:34:35
That can't be right. I thought that BTC was never going to break $11 after pirateat40.

Now would be a bad time for a pirateat40,000
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:42:02
I can't wait to check my balance on Mt. Gox!

I've known about Bitcoin for a long time, and I even did some mining at one point, but I stopped following the news years ago. In the past week, I've been looking on the web for the four websites I remembered. Imagine my surprise when I discover that
* MtGox 
* Bitzino
* D7 Peercoin Pool
* BTC Guild
are all dead. A lot can change in a few years.

Is it actually economical to mine SHA-256 coins with GPUs at this point?

The billions of people who use it every day?
