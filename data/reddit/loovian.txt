Wow thanks, that was cool.  I collected it in changetip.  Do I need to make another account somewhere or can I just live out of changetip?

How does MS calculate the exchange rate?

There's a $1000 per day ($10,000 per month) withdrawal limit from MTGox and Bitcoin withdrawals are included in this quota.  But tanking the price of bitcoins they would be able to withdraw much more and then hopefully sell them after the price recovered.

Unfortunately, I don't really see any way to trust the (virtual) paper these options are written on.  The FAQ says that they are escrowed, which is good, but where is the trust in the escrow service?

Don't have any, sorry.  I don't think there's a way to sell these short though, which is too bad.  Short sales actually do help to stabilize a market by allowing people who are bearish on an asset to add their input and put their money where there mouth is.
Naked short sales suck though.

People have their money locked in Mt Gox and can only withdraw $1000 per day/$10k per month.

Yah, it's possible that this is not a bubble...  but it's much more likely that it is.  That's not to say that it can't remain a valid currency once the bubble pops, just that the speculators and late-to-the-game investors will get burned.

It can go to $0 actually.

Classic bubble behavior! It's a beautiful thing to see because every time it's just a little bit different.

Yeah, and Bitcoins are getting a lot of attention.
It's going through the classic bubble feedback loop of "increased valuation-&gt;media attention" that feeds on itself.  I totally expect to see this on 60 Minutes where it'll hit its peak.

There are no sales at $0 people.  At that point there ceases to be any trades because the product in question has been deemed worthless.
