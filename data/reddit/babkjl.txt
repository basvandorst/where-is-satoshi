Yeah, I just tried to log in and was surprised to discover the site has been gone for a while along with my couple of bitcoins. Maybe the site operator died in an accident and didn't leave instructions for anyone to take over. It might be possible to analyse the bitcoin coin trail and discover that he didn't steal and move them. They may have gone dormant because his estate doesn't have the private keys and they are now lost forever.

Terrorism: "1. the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes."
If the citizens don't accept BYR from the government in payment for their labour and refuse to sell their merchandise for BYR, then the government will send armed police after them and force them to use the BYR. Anyone trying to convert their BYR to other fiat currencies or commodity money like Bitcoin or gold or silver will be either forcibly fined 30% or thrown in jail with police violence if necessary. When a government destroys the hard earned savings of their citizens, the government is the beneficiary.
The BYR deserves to be exactly where the Zimbabwe dollar is: zero. The citizens would then switch to superior forms of money like Bitcoin or gold or silver and refuse to ever use government mandated fiat currency again. That's a big win for the citizens!

Many people should visit as tourists and pay a local person in BTC. The local person pays the hotels and restaurants with their crap currency and explains the virtues of BTC to them. Some hotels and restaurants might eventually take BTC directly if there is a good supply of tourists steered by the local guide. Real people win and the government eventually gets cut out completely like in Zimbabwe.

Help keep it stable by putting up bid / ask ladders on your favourite exchange. Even a small amount distant from the current price helps. Low price volatility equals greater widespread adoption. I spend about ten minutes every day trying to stabilize my 6 favourite cryptos and usually pick up a little bit of profit as well.

I examined it months ago, but there are about 6% in fees to do a round trip plus some risk.   I did buy more when underpriced and sold more when overpriced (rarely), but there's not enough discrepancy to profit.  Plus whoever keeps tossing in the 0.00001 higher bids pisses me off.  I got blown out of my ladder bid / ask spreads last week and I've just gone all in holding onto the bitcoins.  If the price stabilizes better and the bid ask stays wide, I'll jump back in to provide liquidity again.

There are no companies worth investing in because the executives steal all the profits and give next to nothing back in dividends (or share buybacks which are equivalent).  Bring back dividend yields of 5% or 10% without fraud and I'll happily invest in stocks.  They are currently priced five to 10 times too high:  why would I invest in something with a 1% dividend yield and a 5% chance of going bankrupt this year?  Forget about price appreciation, as all companies eventually end up in bankruptcy and the stock goes to zero.  Only dividends count.

Ok.  Assuming you are an honest guy, what if some of the 11,600 subscribers to this subreddit sent you a significant amount of bitcoins for you and your agents to buy Nokia 1280 phones.  Are there high value compact products in Kenya that you could mail out to North America or Europe that we can buy from you?  
I've roasted my own green coffee beans that I mail order from Los Angeles, United States for about 10 years.  I just stir them in a pot on the stove with a wooden spoon, but I'll be purchasing the following soon:     Kenya Nyeri Gaturiri Peaberry coffee (Gaturiri is a coffee factory (read as cooperative wet mill) near the town of Karatina in the heart of Nyeri) costs me US $68.48 for 10 pounds plus about another $50 to get it to Canada.  If you could ship it to me in Canada for US$120 per 10 pounds I would be a happy buyer.  With help from other coffee drinkers we could even ship 20 or 40 foot sea containers directly to Vancouver, Canada.
If this is your most viable export product, you could run deals within Kenya, even paying the tax on the transactions, that eventually gets to us as coffee for Bitcoins.  Is there anyone else here interested?

Yes, a Canadian exchange please.  I'm losing about 6% in fees on thousands of dollars to get back into Canadian dollars for selling Silver Maple Leaf coins.  I'm definately not a fan of using nonfederal noreserve US$ as an intermediary currency either.  Interac e-mail transfers are just fine by me.

Hey, I'm one of those "assholes"  I'm a strong supporter of Bitcoins and have sold about 60 Silver Maple Leaf coins for them.  I buy Bitcoins from my sons who have expensive custom mining rigs cooled by geothermal air.  I spend hours every week placing and readjusting speculative pricing ladders on two exchanges in order to add liquidity and to stabilize the price.  Prospective merchants don't care what the price is, but it must be stable and easily traded.

I've successfully sold $3,500 worth of silver coins for Bitcoins.  I cashed them out within hours on Mt. Gox.  It worked fairly well.  I did lose out on 8% in round trip fees that my customers knew about and included in the price. cavirtex.com should now reduce that percentage substantially for Canadians.  Unfortunately, I missed out on the tenfold increase in the price of Bitcoins, had I held them longer.  If more Bitcoin proponents would put up market making ladders (sell at +2%, +5%, +10%, +20%, buy at -2%, -5%, -10%, -20%) it would dampen out the swings in the price and make it more attractive for merchants. 
@_date: 2011-12-29 19:59:30
Help us stabilize it by putting in $100 and spreading ladder bids across your favourite exchanger:  bid 5 @ $3.50, bid 5 @ $4.00, offer 5 @ $4.25 offer 5 @ $4.75 etc.  We also need put and call options, but lots of people with small ladders will eventually freeze out the volatility.

I've used GetEMoney twice to go from Liberty Reserve to my Canadian bank account by Interac e-mail transfer.  It's 3.5% plus $5.  Total cut through Mt. Gox is about 6%.  I just add 6% to my Bitcoin price.  It kind of defeats the whole point of 0.01 Bitcoin transaction fees, but it's a reliable starting point that is the key to my Silver Maple Leaf coin dealing business.  I'm more comfortable holding Bitcoins while waiting for products useful to me to appear online.

Lots of people with random bids and offers will result in a deep and strong V.  Steep walls will encourage evil banksters like JPM and Goldman Sacks to breach the steep slopes in a quiet trading period and pocket the profit from the resulting huge gap move.  They do this all the time in the gold and especially in the silver futures market to scare people away from the wild volatility, then they also pocket the wide bid / ask spread by market making in a thin trading environment.  We don't want this in bitcoins.

RippleUnion for CAN$, but the spreads are quite high, even with my ladder bids and asks. Whenever I tighten them up, I end up with too much CAN$ and it takes a long time to balance them back out again. Some parallel help would be appreciated.
Snapswap for BTC and US$. Low spreads and lots of activity.
GBI for XAU (gold) The trading levels are really low and the spreads are high. I expected that the issuing gateway would keep a wall of bids and asks about 10% off the market price, but there is nothing like that present.
Easiest way in is to fund an account using BTC. Getting BTC out is also easy.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:20:53
Agree. There is very minimal trading of CAN$ on Ripple as well. I'm trying to be a market maker there to enable conversions between BTC, US$, XRP and CAN$, but i'm lucky to get a CAN$ trade per week. Lots of XRP / US$ / BTC transactions happening. I invite you fellows to consider Ripple as a potential replacement for CAVirtex. My roundtrip transaction fees are almost zero. I liked CAVirtex very much, but the roundtrip transaction fees were quite high. Yes, I know many people feel Ripple is a scam coin, but it's number 2 behind Bitcoin on  and I like it.

I'm very partial to the Big Mac index. The first one was 0.49 USD in 1969. I compared the price of Big Macs over 20 years in Canada to the Canadian inflation index and was very surprised to see a close match. I was expecting the Canadian inflation index to be corrupt and significantly lag behind the true purchasing power of earned salary as measured by the ability to purchase a Big Mac. Big Macs include labor, real estate, taxes, commodities etc and is the same product as in 1969. When people babble on about how much "money" they made in real estate over decades, I always challenge them to price in Big Macs when purchased and again now. Their real gains aren't as dramatic as they initially thought and it helps to expose to statists how corrupt fiat currency is.

PerfectMoney says US customers are not welcome:  
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:34:52
Challenge accepted.  The object is to place and maintain bids that are 1, 2 and 3 daily standard deviations below the current bid prices and ask prices that are 1, 2 and 3 daily standard deviations above the current ask prices.  A simplified example:  the best bid is $66.60 and the best ask is $66.90.  You place bids as follows $66.50, $66.00, $65.00 and asks as follows:  $67.00, $67.50, $68.50.  If the price moves down to $66.25, then up to $67.25 and back down to $66.90, you just profited a small amount across the spread.  Reset the $66.50 bid and the $67.00 ask.
Send some of your Bitcoins to one of the exchanges with low transaction fees.  When it appears in your exchange account, select half of the value and sell them for a penny less that the current ask price.  Chase the price if you have to, but always slightly less than the latest ask price.  Split your value into 6 slices and place the bids and asks as above in my example.  You don't have to use a spreadsheet to get the Standard Deviations, just guesstimate:  daily high - daily low = 1 Standard Deviation.  To get more frequent trades, multiply the round trip transaction fee by 3 then multiply by the latest quote to get the minimum spread you are trying to achieve (BTC-E at 0.002 per transaction X 2 = 0.004 roundtrip * 3 = 0.012 * latest quote of $66.40 = $0.80.  Whenever you sell, immediately turn around and place a bid at your sold price - $0.80.  If I sold at $66.40, I place a bid at $65.60.  Keep repeating.
If you get all bought up in a rapidly rising market, just buy back in at the higher price and set up the 3 bids and 3 asks around the latest price.  Same thing if you get all bought in during a falling market.  If it happens too often, split into 8 trades at 1, 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations.  When selecting price points, I often front run huge bids or asks by jumping a few pennies ahead of them, or I look for wide gaps in the market and split it to provide the extra liquidity.
Yes, it is time consuming to maintain it.  Like ThePiachu says, it's a hobby.  Over the two years I have been doing this, it has paid about $50 per month with $1,000 at risk.  The real benefits are providing liquidity to the market, narrowing the bid / ask spreads and dampening down the volatility.  These are key points required for mainstream adoption.

Perfect Money?  You mean a non redeemable zero coupon note that has lost 97% of its value since inception in 1913 that doesn't even meet the definition of "money" because it is not a store of value?  USD are fiat currency subject to capital controls where you can't move move than $10,000 across borders without declaring it.  It is also being inappropriately created out of thin air to benefit banks to the detriment of citizens.  I could go on, but I'll keep my Bitcoins and reject USD as unsound and unwelcome.

I've been a dealer of Canadian Maple Leaf coins for Bitcoins in the past. The greatest problem is an inability to insure the shipment. Neither Canada Post, nor any of the couriers will do it. If you want the sender to self insure you, then a signature on delivery will be required for extra $ plus a couple of percent to account for the insurance feature itself. These few extra percent make the transaction unappealing for potential buyers as it no longer looks like a good deal. You're just better off going to your local coin store and paying cash.  It only makes sense to mail the coins to people in rural areas without easy access to a low markup coin store. Sending outside the country is worrisome as you don't know if the receiving country steals mailed items or not. Even a couple of thefts where you would have to replace or refund wipes out any potential profit margin. For me, I would have to pass the delivery risk to the customer, or not bother with the transaction. I have sold face to face before as well, but it consumes about an hour of transportation and transaction time. A common weekly or monthly meet up location for a decent number of cash / Bitcoin / precious metal transactions for several dealers would be best, but not easily put together.
@_date: 2013-09-21 22:52:26
The way to overcome low liquidity and big spreads is for everyone reading this to take a small fraction of their bitcoin hoard and put it into play on one of the exchanges. Set up ladder bids and asks close to the current price and actively maintain them with a spread that's triple the round trip fee on the exchange. For example, for a price of $125, set up bids at $124, $123, $122, $121, $120, $115, $110 with asks at $126, $127, $128, $129, $130, $135, $140. This will help stabilize the price and counter some of the main arguments that people deride bitcoins with.

I don't agree with point 3.  We need many more day traders, even novices, to spread some wide ladder quotes over the bid / ask spreads to dampen down the volatility.  The price swings are scaring the general public away.  I recommend that a large number of people do this with 10% to 20% of their hoard.  If you get bought or sold out, reset the ladder. You'll profit a little from the swings and lose a little from the price breakouts to be neutral over the long term.  The various exchanges will collect a few fees to make them stronger, the bid / ask spread narrows with depth, and the general public will be much more likely to adopt Bitcoins.  Everyone wins except the bankers.  (How's that Cyprus fiasco working out?  Bitcoins 1 European Central Bank 0!)
