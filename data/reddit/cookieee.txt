For those who don't know; travel and vacation tickets is one of the top online-purchase market. That and concert tickets. Atleast that's what I learned during my research about Quebec's internet adoption and usage. It may not apply to the rest of the world - Because fact: Quebec is always late to the technology parties.

Fork does seem to impact prices. But eventually (based on history so nothing guaranteed) things settles and price will readjust over time.

Direct deposit, bank transfer or what ever we call it.
Thing is I need to dig up blockchain transaction to prove certain activity. I withdrew some BTC from my VoS account a few months after purchase. I need to find out the address I sent it to.
I'll try to contact mark I guess.
Thanks by the way.

Yes it's fascinating to think about. Look at what happened in the past 15 years.

You see, I think that the only thing that could stop that from happening would be a security flaw / change to the foundation (21m cap).
As dumb as it sounds, I think of it like Runescape's 'Christmas Crackers' - an item that was 'air dropped' earlier in 2000. This item could be opened and created 1 'Party Hat'. Party Hats don't even do anything special, but they kept becoming rarer and rarer because they're a limited supply. Pink party used to be the most valuable - I guess due to it's unpopularity during the 'air drop' A lot of people that got Pink out of their Christmas Cracker didn't bother and 'deleted' it. It quickly became the rarest.
The only time that party hats took a huge hit in value (although they recovered) was due to a 'hacker' that found and exploit and duplicated them massively. Pink Party Hat was duped the most and I beleive it became the least valuable after that.
I used to worry but no more... Blockchain is the game. Us being here means that were playing this game and odds are that we'll have nicer stats and items the longer we play it.

Cryptocurrency if spiking. But it looks like nothing if you compare it to Bitcoin.
