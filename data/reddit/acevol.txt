Well I have no intend to go back to fiat but I still would call myself at this point as an investor.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:39
Yes, this is a really big step for bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:06:41
Still its not about that. Its because segwit adaption and +2MB blocks.
  
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:22:28
They try to trick you into buying bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:04:14
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:24:03
You can test it offline.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:41:20
 this is also good icym :D
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:13:21
Segwit adaption happening, which means more block space = more transactions per block and lower fees
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:45:19
There never be coin as neutral as bitcoin. Satoshi knew this and thats why he left it to the people to build it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:25
You are watching the wrong chart.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:28:51
And for those who doesn't know, Jack is CEO of twitter. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:05:29
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:19:32
Because the segwit the blocks has more space which is now +2MB 
Block size is changing to block weight which allow more limit to them.

LTC is not going anywhere, its going to be here with BTC and with LN because of the atomic swaps. Also unlikely the every other coin LTC is not competing against BTC but rather working together.  Charlie Lee has said this multiple times, even in his latest interview in december 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:51:12
Segwit adaption. 
Transactions hasn't been dropping that much. Still about average amount
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:08:22
Conbase still does not batch their tx and does not use segwit. I suggest you to use some other exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:54:22
No it does not. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:03:08
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:29:48
Yes it's called BULLISH AS FUCK
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:25:38
And keep in mind this is from 2015.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:47:09
No shit, but how long has there been illegal dealers using fiat? Since the beginning of fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:45:51
Yes been Tom Lee fan since I saw this 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:29:20
I'm wondering who came up with these names for those :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:38:39
Nope it is narrated by Stephanie Murphy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:04:41
Where have you been the last month? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:04
Because it doesn't matter at all. It doesn't make any difference if one person is straight or gay. Also none of your business.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:11:52
Yes just go youtube and search "how bitcoin works"
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:02:56
How many times will this be posted? :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:26:57
Coinbase sucks not only because the fees but I tried to move my coins to ledger wallet and they delayed it for 72 hours even though I have verified account.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:25:00
Not breaking ATH last 2 weeks, "Btc is dead" lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:14:59
It doesn't work with bcash? Because bcash doesn't support segwit. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:17:50
So it is just a site where you gather news from coindesk? Why would I go to your site instead of going straight to  coindesk?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:55
 This video from 2015 where andreas talks about bitcoin bubble should be in front page every time when bitcoin price goes down :D It is a roller coaster. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:43
Super Bitcoin (498888 block)
Bitcoin Platinum (500000 block)
Bitcoin Uranium (unknown)
Bitcoin Cash Plus (501407 block)
Bitcoin Silver (TBD) $BTC
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:24:30
 It's going to be rollercoaster ride atleast year or two still.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:58
Anywhere else but not from coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:42:19
Lmao all who disses these tats, Bitlord says Hi 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:16:48
Does somebody have that 4chan type of jpg of why bitcoin cash was made?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:01:18
Well obviously the timing wasn't the best. (Don't try to time the market) Like you said just hodl :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:34:58
They indeed are.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:46:39
Charlie Lee sold his litecoins and donated millions of dollars for Litecoin development.  Also he is still full time working with litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:03:52
Such a spam account..
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:08:50
Why it would take 24 hours?
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:51:19
How is she weak? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:44:09
Google will help.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:28:09
 Food for thought :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:54:41
Because Adam &amp; co are real cypherpunks who aren't in this for fame and money.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:41:16
No it does not prove. If anything this proves it is that Satoshi wasn't only one person.
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:41:35


This clown in 2014.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:52:48
You pointed out that YOU have hard time to listen her. I'm not a native english speaker but I did not have that hard time to listen what she was speaking.
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:42:04
How can we get Andreas again there?
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:29:21
Because that was not the ETF they are waiting for.
