It’s not quite the same, since Bitcoin is completely open source. Apple’s Code is only partly open source.

The Internet still had Net Neutrality then, it was just under Title I. However, Verizon proved Title I doesn’t apply, so they were moved to Title II to preserve Net Neutrality that has always existed.

North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
The nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. Investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene.
Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 
AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called ISIS, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
A report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 
The FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the airwaves auction.
AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products. 
During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

Net Neutrality has always existed before Title I. However, in 2015, Verizon proved that Title I didn’t apply to ISPs, so they were moved to Title II to preserve the Net Neutrality that has always existed.
Without it, ISPs could force all bitcoin transactions to contain a fee of whatever they wish to the ISPs. They have no reason not to.

That uses so little bandwidth.

I don’t think you know what the Neutral in Net Neutrality means.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:29:16
Open source doesn’t always mean safe. It just means anyone can check.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:50:52
I don’t think you understand what Neutrality means. It means unregulated. We don’t want ISPs to regulate the Internet.

Put the **encrypted** private key into Google Drive (make sure it’s encrypted, with a good passphrase). Setup your Google account so that it sends your data to a trusted person after a year of inactivity (the Google inactive account manager). Tell them the passphrase, tell them not to keep it somewhere it can be hacked.
Now if you die, a year later they will be sent the private key. They can now unlock the private key with the passphrase they know. If someone hacks your Google Account, who cares, it’s encrypted.
The worst thing that could happen is that if a hacker gets into your account and learns the passphrase. This is a risk you must be willing to take.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:29
We don’t want regulation. That’s why we want to keep laws that prevent ISPs from regulating it.

Competition doesn’t work when ISPs have monopolies over the majority of Americans.

Netflix wasn’t getting charged extra because they used more bandwidth, they were getting charged extra just because they were Netflix, and ISPs wanted to take some of their money. Netflix was already happily paying proportional to their bandwidth, ISPs just blackmailed them into paying more than usual, which was ridiculous, since ISPs can transmit the data just as easily, so they’re just pocketing the extras at an honest business’ expense.

It doesn’t cost them any extra to give customers the entire Internet, so they won’t be saving money by restricting it. They’ll just be gaining money at your expense by making you think you need to pay more.

Titles aren’t levels of regulation, they are sections of the Communications Act of 1934. They cover all kinds of stuff, not just ISPs. Title 0 isn’t a thing.

It’s not impossible to understand. Absolutely everything you need to know in order to run the entire cryptocurrecy has been described in a 9 page document (8 if you exclude the references).

Title I existed before then, but ISPs were moved to Title II, since Title I doesn’t apply anymore.

iPhones generally have less RAM than competitors, but **way** better processors, GPUs, security, and software (in some aspects, overall is hard to judge).
Snapdragon is still playing years worth of catch-up to the A series, which is embarrassing coming from the best ARM chip manufacturer.

Is there a reason you cannot use an alternative to Coinbase along with Coinbase (like [CEX.IO](cex.io))?
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:10:02
The point of decentralized cryptocurrencies is that no one can just take your money. If you put Coinbase in charge of your private keys, that puts you at risk of them denying you access to your Bitcoins (which happens).
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:53:09

A mistake I could imagine people make is to buy when the price goes up, and sell when it goes down. This, if done without thought can be very bad. Just stick with what you have until you need it.

The reason you cannot have an open source machine is because, how can you know that's what's running? If you let anyone look with their "unknown USB stick", anyone who has access to it (anyone who can write a virus and can vote) an transitively access the final count machine.

Please, although I prefer Blockchain, because it is more reliable (try it if you'd like), your experience was probably either really rare, your fault, or not as bad as it seems. Also, don't keep $12,000 worth of Bitcoin in a hot wallet. Transfer it to a "bank" like CEX.IO, or keep it in paper wallets (don't loose them!) in the future.
