1 in a trillion would be a cakewalk.
It's more like 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936

And now we have the perfect t-shirt for his 18th b-day!

We had that chat as well, but he's keen on seeing what will happen to it. I need to figure out an easy way for him to monitor how his investment is doing. Maybe a little RasPi + LCD ticker project is in the works!

He's talking about a Porsche 911 as being his first car, but that was way before we did this.

This is why I only offered him the 2x payout if it tanks!
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:50:07
It was done a few days ago and there was a 3% purchase fee...

Don't trust, verify!

Using a password manager such as lastpass or 1password (I use 1password ) will also help prevent this as they have browser plugins that won't auto fill the user/pass on the incorrect site.

Ack! Good catch!

No, it only does things once.
If you don't have the latest file, the script will download it for you and verify its authenticity. If you already have the latest file, the script will still download the SHA256SUMS.asc and verify that the file is legit or download a new copy if it's not.

Going to leave the main post unedited, so I'll post the "what does the script do" details here.
If you don't already have the latest file:
1) Determine the latest version of bitcoin by checking  (right now that would match `bitcoin-core-0.18.0`)
2) Downloads SHA256SUMS.asc from 
3) Import the bitcoin release signing key `01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964 ` listed at 
4) Verify the signed message inside of SHA256SUMS.asc - if this fails, the script exists
5) Download the tar.gz file from  with a `.unverified` suffix
6) Get the SHA-256 checksum of the downloaded file
7) Compare the checksum against the one listed in the verified SHA256SUMS.asc file
8) If the verification succeeds remove the `.unverified` suffix. If the verification fails, change the `.unverified` suffix to `.BAD`
If you already have the last file, it will still verify the SHA256SUMS.asc and SHA-256 checksum of the pre-existing file and download a new version if it doesn't pass the verification steps.

That line takes the server output and pipes it to grep, sort and tail.
The regex used in grep `[0-9.]+[0-9]` can't be literally anything as you suggest, it's catching a specific numerical pattern. See this sample output I just posted at [regexer](
