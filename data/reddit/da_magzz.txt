I thought the CBOE margin was increased to 44%

I bought some Nvidia, AMD, and Overstock this week. Closest things I could think of for now

Model X for me -- still a long ways away though!

I bought two (one is a backup) and I restored the second from the first one's seed. I recommend keeping the second in another location in case of fire or loss of the first.

 possibly because bcc is now more profitable to mine 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:53:05
Yes, that is without question. I was making the point that I'm a strong believer of extra security -- having a second one in case you ever lose your first so you have access to your funds right away

This seems biased as it's done by one of the providers...

Thank you; I posted this for general visibility as I do not believe the trustee is acting on behalf of the best interests of clients. Anyone affected has an opportunity to also contact the above number direclty and raise their concern regarding future btc sales (as the trustee is likely not on Reddit / crypto twitter :)

If you are upset about this I suggest calling the MtGox Trustee Help Desk at 011 81-3-4588-3922. Identify yourself as a creditor and politely ask them to inform Nobuaki Kobayashi that he is NOT representing your interests. (Note 011 is from North America yours might be different)

What have the other big exchanges there said? I'd like all of them too...

What is the summit that was cancelled? I can't find anything on Google. Thanks!

I like the android "bitcoin checker" app -- you can set it to the price of your fave/most used exchange

The one advantage to buying on Quadriga is if you see a massive dip and think it's short-lived, you can send up to $2k (if verified) within a few min to the exchange and buy.

Mainstream news is already reporting? I think when the 2 top exchanges make announcements, it will cause another dip.

Depends on if you have time or not to buy. Worth it being verified on both. Generally Coinbase, but if there is a quick dip you want to take advantage of, Quadriga could be useful too. Quadriga better for selling overall.

Percentages don't work that way when you go down, only when you go up. When you lose a hundred percent do you lose all.
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:54:32
I've decided to HODL most, but play with a small stack; look at it this way, will you feel worse if it goes a lot higher and you miss out, or that you didn't sell some of it? If there is a dip, it may end up being very short-lived. So stick to your guns, have a plan at the beginning, and stick to it. There's nothing worse than saying you're going to hold and then selling near the bottom because emotion got the better of you. At some point the market's gone down too far and it's too risky to sell (remember the 1-day 40% ETH, and ~20% BTC rebound after UASF woes?). Good luck to all the HODLers and risk-takers! [Disclosure, I'm a small fish, so not that much to lose with to begin with or to take risks]

Yup, many complex spreadsheets. The tough part is that my country hasn't come out with tax regulations on this yet.

You can sell on Quadriga CX. They tend to have a premium over other exchanges oh, so they're great for selling.
