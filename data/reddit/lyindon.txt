by unopened you mean he shouldnt plug it in to the sites mentioned below?  
sorry - i cant even call myself a novice.  im entirely clueless.  
and thank you for that suggestion if thats the case.

Nada yet.  Told him what was suggested here but haven’t heard back.  Think he’s working 
I know often times it isn’t the case when someone says “asking for a friend” but it actually is for a friend this time!

got it. ok cool I'll have him look into it.  
i wasnt even sure actual physical bitcoins existed.  
thanks again!

that sounds like a trick!  ;)
but nah you're absolutely right.  i dont know much about cryptocurrency - but i know it to be the wild wild west with some shady characters.  
appreciate it!
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:24:16
which it has!  
but as we are both pretty clueless.  it definitely isnt a chuckie cheese coin.  it looks identical to those i'm finding pictures of online.  
if it is legit - what would he do with it to redeem it (for lack of a better term)
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:26:44
awesome thank you sir
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:25:59
so he would input the code on the coin into that site?  
thanks man
I'll read up on it.  or I should say I'll have him check it out.  he just doesnt have a reddit account and didnt know who to ask.
