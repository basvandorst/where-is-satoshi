Sorry about that; it should be fixed now. I'll also update the tarball today and tag a new release. Let me know if you have any more problems (or if the original problem wasn't fixed).
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:05:49
Sure, what would you like for it to do? :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:13:11
Sure thing!

Yay storytime! This happened back in 2007, and my memory isn't perfect, but this is the best I can recollect the events that made me swear to never buy Alienware again and to always speak ill of them, given the opportunity.
I deployed to Iraq in 2006 for 18 months. I was 18, in the infantry, and stuck in some outpost in Fallujah; no showers, no toilets, no electricity, nothing. I ordered an Alienware during one of my trips back to the FOB and was really excited about it. I had it shipped to my mom's house for when I'd return a couple month later. I was an avid WoW player back then... except the whole Iraq-thing made it impossible, so my friends and I would literally dream about getting back home and playing it. Needless to say, I was very excited about getting my Alienware when I returned home for leave. Finally, I'm back in America and pick up my laptop from my mom's house. I install WoW, boot it up, and it doesn't look nearly as good as it's supposed to: textures are messed up, game crashes or freezes randomly, etc. I realize that something on the hardware is probably messed up, so I give them a call shortly after opening the box. This had been a bit more than a month after ordering the thing, but I figured the whole deployment thing, plus leaving it unopened until now should be reasonable enough to be under warranty still, especially against a manufacturing defect (I assumed a faulty video card or something). I talk with customer support for over an hour, and they told me I was out of luck because it was longer than 30 days (or 60 days, I don't remember...). I told them my story and they didn't budge a bit. In the end, I had to mail it back to them, pay them to repair it, and mail it back to me, after I had just spent thousands on the laptop and used it for approximately an hour. A year later, the damn thing overheats and didn't work at all. Definitely the best $3k(?) I ever spent. Fuck you, Alienware.
**tl;dr: Bought a laptop from Alienware during a deployment; didn't work when I got it. Had to pay them for repairs. Broke again year later anyway.**

Thanks man. :)

Sure this post is a little redundant, but it really does serve as a good reminder/inspiration for new people to establish new full nodes. So I support it.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:03:29
I'll write one today. :)
***Edit:*** *Done! It's available in any of the git master branches, or in the v1.0.1 tarball.*
@_date: 2014-10-19 12:54:44
Personal preference for those that trust bitcoin-QT. I manually update mine (thus it took 20 days past the update to realize it needed to be upgraded). But I also realize not everyone has the time--or interest--in maintaining full nodes and are doing it as a curteousy to the rest of the world with the spare hardware/bandwidth/time that they have.
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:06:38
~~Thanks! I'll update this today.~~
***Edit:*** *Updated in version 1.0.1*
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:58:13
Regarding resource consumption:
**HDD Space:**


    24G	/home/bitcoin/
    24G	total


    1000160
*(That's 1,000,160 KB, so just under 1 GB of memory)*


    55.8
*(This VM is running 2 intel cores at 2GHz each, and its using 55.8% of that; so about 2GHz of processing is used)*
I'll work on writing an update/upgrade script; this was also requested in another comment.

Regarding the *.tar.gz:

***Edit:*** *Updated the version to v1.0.1*
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:42:41
Unfortunately, I don't have a Linux Mint machine to test it on, but I know there will be at least one small problem with the script autostarting (running on boot). Debian uses *update-rc.d*, where Mint will use */etc/rc.local*. Mint has /etc/init.d, IIRC, so the install should be fine--you'll just have to make sure you run:


when you boot the machine every time. (Or just add the script to your rc.local)
If you end up testing it out, let me know if it works and what problems (if any) you encounter.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:02:03
As far as running smoothly: once you've got your instance running for a couple of hours and you're up to date on the blockchain download, run ./check_connections.sh -- it should say how many peers are using your node. If you're over 8 then you're good to go and you're contributing. :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:51:05
I definitely agree [ true ] / for..in should be used for readability. I've pushed those changes to the repos.
I'd love to improve on the &gt;8 connections logic, however I can't find any information about an "incoming" flag. *(src:  Do you know of one?
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:12:48
Yeah, totally. check_connection.sh and blockchain_progress.sh are meant to be run as your regular user. When you ran install.sh, the end of the output should have had a notice with three lines of code you needed to execute in your terminal. Just copy &amp; paste them as the user you want to run the info scripts as. If you've lost that output, create a .bitcoin directory in your home. Then as root, copy the contents of /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf into your /home/&lt;user&gt;/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (and make sure it has the proper permissions).
Example (let's assume "user" is your account username):
As root:
    mkdir /home/user/.bitcoin
    cp /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf /home/user/.bitcoin/.
    chown -R user:user /home/user/.bitcoin
    chmod -R 770 /home/user/.bitcoin

Yeah it'd be fun to set up an alternative; it currently only uses bitcoind. I'll definitely consider btcd as a config option in my script. :)
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:47:18
Hey awesome!
I wrote some scripts a few weeks ago that automates the whole process. If anyone wants to use them in lieu of this post, they're [here](
*Caveat*: My scripts only support Bitcoin and are specialized for Debian-based linux distributions.
**Edit**: Also, anyone can use use my node if they are inclined. btc.softwareverde.com
**Double Edit**: It'd be super cool if you'd add my scripts to your main post, but no obligation.
@_date: 2015-08-22 03:11:20
This is a stupid old post, so I'm sorry for replying late. But, if you're still looking to set up a node on linux (particularly Debian), feel free to check out my scripts:  -- they don't currently support XT, but I'm looking into doing that tonight (thus the revival of this thread).
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:43:47
This is an awesome suggestion and I appreciate the feedback. I'll work on adding this.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:42:39
I absolutely appreciate the scrutiny, especially in the name of security. However, you can't log in or authenticate as the created daemon user, so there should be no problem.
The script invokes:
    passwd -l "${DAEMON_USER}" &gt;/dev/null # Lock the account
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:47:51
The README covers this. Don't trust my scripts. Read them first--they're not long and I tried to be as clear as reasonably so. has a great point to verify the binaries via GnuPG (I wrongfully assumed SSL/TLS should be enough), and I plan to add that improvement.
It's not about the repo being hacked and morr just being smart. If you auto pull my scripts and then auto run update.sh, you've essentially opened your computer up to a malicious update.
