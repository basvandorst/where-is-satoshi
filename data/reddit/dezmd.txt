That's exactly what I'm doing.  The coin, on its own merits, is an obvious windfall for ASICBOOST and Bitmain to preserve a business advantage. Litecoin was already a viable alternative to do exactly what BCH argues it's needed for.
 


I don't dislike Roger Ver personally, I dislike his professional persona. His interview whining, his lies, and his self serving propaganda that he uses in media. It's just not ok to be unethical, even in the cryptocurrency business fields. 
 


LTC "fixed the fees" for years before BCH shows up on the scene, the entire argument for BCH was a lie from the start. Its all about ASICBOOST and the mining machines, no amount of flowery language. misdirection, and propaganda is going to change this.
Ver goes out and demands BCH 'is bitcoin' in interviews, it's using Bitcoin as marketing. BCH is not Bitcoin, and it's LOONEY TUNES to think that argument even matters. Lying for the sake of marketing is still lying.

It's use is certainly a better store of value or an investment vehicle than a currency at the moment, it's just a matter of the open development process incorporating changes (safely) that increase transactions per block while maintaining the intent of decentralized currency.
You should be using altcoins as payment methods right now, for example Litecoin has worked for years as an alternative for value transfer at a low cost with a more stable price for the duration of a transaction (not to say it hasn't run into its own hiccups brought forth by its success as a value store in exhanges). BCH is just another wannabe litecoin that used the free coins of a btc hard fork to prop up value and is unethically being promoted as real Bitcoin, using the Bitcoin name as marketing to create an arbitrarily increased valuation based on the original chain.

I didn't say you did, now sure why the downvote.
 I'm pointing out the HODLers of various coins over the past year or so may have seen over 1600% gains on an investment. It's difficult to justify HODL and not take gains 'just in case' if your initial investment was considerable, that level of growth is very contrary to traditional investment scenarios.  People that do continue to HODL will take some gains, you can get your initial investment out at this point without much affect on your overall valuation, but they may still HODL in more of a 'get and forget' sort of situation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:49:16

Russia and China have such insane corruption issues that American corruption almost looks like normal behavior by comparison.  Everyone has racism and nationalist bullshit in their country, the issue is the level of corruption that is required to even participate in the normal course of day to day business. 
This is likely related to the fact that they have less cultural considerations for ethical ramifications when it comes to casually lying and committing fraud against someone considered to be foreign (even applies among different provinces in their own country). You gamble when you do business in China, and you're absolutely foolish to leave any large amounts of money in such a foreign exchange. US and EU options are more likely to have a legal framework that you can use to fight for your money without having to bribe every government official and judge involved.

Hell no, I'll pay my taxes on trades like a good citizen, you can take them to court! ;)
I think that crypto "coins" could be entirely outside of the definition of currency based on its use, and the IRS may in fact be exerting controls it doesn't really have sufficient authority to do. I'm sure Congress could fix that fairly easily.
Couldn't you deal in CALs for Windows or licenses of any software distribution in the same way? Asserting a value, collecting them and selling/swapping them for amounts of other software licenses?  Digital software gets special tax considerations for sales, and in the same vein has value and could be traded using a 'market' overlay based on their values.  Software currency isn't really currency, its just a tokenized piece of code that someone may or may not be willing to buy.

That's shares of ownership, ICOs are not IPOs.
**IPO:** the investor is entitled upon subscription, to a claim in the entities assets minus its liabilities (known as equity) and has a right to vote on matters relating to the company.
**ICO:** The investor will have a claim to the usage of that token but have no equity in the underlying corporate entity nor voting power. 
**The ICO Exception Case:** The exception is ICOs which offer profit sharing agreements, or voting agreements, which can bring them under regulatory purvue in that it blurs the distinction between the an IPO and a revenue generating product or service token.
As to my note of your limited comments, people hold on to shell accounts for PR, marketing, and advertising purposes. Your account follows a commonly seen strategy.

All sorts of manipulation and fraud happens in a fully regulated market.  This puts more power into consumers hand directly, and that scares the shit out of establishment finance without question.

So strange how you're a sparsely used account with only two posts over 9 months before you jump in here with some ICO FUD.
An ICO has nothing to do with changing the structure of a company to public unless it that is the specific intent of the ICO.  The ICO is not an IPO in the sense you seem to limit it's definition to, it's a transaction type that can be used to sell company credits or other company managed products. Generally, it is a private transaction that's been made in a openly transparent fashion.
Banks are simply not needed at all in that sense, the legal framework you are trying to bolt in only occurs when a company is performing an ICO as a controlling instrument for the company rather than investment for a product or service provided, defined, and controlled by the company.
Did I miss something in my own review of the issues on this? So far, it just seems like a lot of people are trying to jam a star shaped peg into a quarter moon shaped hole when this stuff comes up. It only fits into your regulatory framework when you shape it into a device that impersonates another device in the framework you are looking at. You could use, and ultinately argue to outlaw, literally anything used to represent publicly traded controlling shares in a company. ICO is a multiuse instrument far beyond traditional stock shares.

The prostitutes thing doesn't belong and deserved no response, asserting he spent customer funds on them is a wild speculation unless there is a public news report, guilty plea or finding of guilt on that point in particular I'm not aware of.

When's the last goddamn time a corporation didn't overstep? Governments are slow bastards, private individuals and corps are much better at fucking you over.  A balance is needed, this libertarian stuff is bullshit.
What will actually happen: the governments will over-regulate crypto AFTER the private corporations and power brokers have sufficient control  over it, placing barriers to entry on acting as a money exchnager and holder for others.  Banks will be the only ones "legally" allowed to run crypto nodes. miners, and wallets.  Privatization without regulation just leads to control without consequences for fraud.  Nothing is a black and white, 0 or 1, on or off, kind of answer in this realm.  Pure privatization arguments are complete nonsense in that regard, even if they hold merit in the face of over-regulation.

The second one.  
If Bitfinex/Tether "prints" another 100 million worth of USDT onto it's chain, then mixes the coins to hide origination and anonymize the transaction chain, then buys bitcoin with it (or has a third party/intermediary entity do it), then uses the purchased bitcoin to help keep tether pegged at $1 USD valuation in the midst of ongoing volatility and swings, isn't that just outright fraud? In the realm of little to no regulation of crypto, can you truly, accurately detect this happening?  I don't think there is an effective framework to prevent or detect, the entity mixing the coins would have to slip up, but if there were no slip ups, you could inject unlimited valuation into cryptocurrency on the back of tether that's pegged to a price but not backed up with legitimate fiat despite that being the expectation.

August 1st. LTC. 
ETH is it's own separate can of worms. 
BTC has a multifront fight ahead of itself. 
USD2.00 fee to xfer USD29.00 worth of BTC in a timely manner last week.

Why not both?
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:45:39
Yeah that was 5 years ago.

10001, final offer!

It also means bitcoin is volatile RIGHT NOW and early actors in it are statistically more likely to be criminals and scam artists.
It's not stronger and more resilient than ever yet, it has to get to that point and only by having huge failures can the ecosystem learn to adjust against the corrupting influences.
You're making a strictly philosophical statement in a discussion meant to examine known facts and search for reasonably considered outcomes. We get it, you're a true believer in bitcoin, but that has nothing to do with considering the possibility Binance associated people could be pulling a scam.
I like Binance, I don't want them to turn out to be just more blatantly corrupted assholes, but I'm not going to pretend I have some direct insight into those involved and discard any notion of possible corruption.

I can take BTC right now that converts straight to USD using coinbase for processing. LTC is probably a better choice short term based on the current trajectory of segwit, possible mit lightning on Aug 1, and xfer fees.

Cash out the amount to pay back the loan AND cash out the amount equivalent to his savings and retirement (+ applicable taxes), then get crazy with the trading on the free money that is not taxed until your gains are actually realized.

Shhh, it's okay. Just the tip.

Printers only got hard after that bidirectional lpt serial cable shit showed up on HP Deskjet printers.  Once upon a time, they were just 'plug it in and print to the correct port'.  And then deal with the noise.
