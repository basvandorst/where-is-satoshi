It's weird, because you're saying right there in your post how they create money, but you start by saying they don't.
Anyway, they really do get to create money.  When a customer comes to them for a mortgage, they create the liability (the money) and the asset (the loan) at the same time, they don't have to borrow it from anyone.  They have a license to do that, provided they stay under a certain leverage.

I am not OP, but look up Kelly criterion and portfolio theory. Given your two options above, the mathematically correct strategy would be allocating some resources to each. If that seems counterintuitive then also look up gambler's ruin. 
Simply put, someone's return when iterating over the coin flip option would go broke very quickly and have no money to make profitable investments, whereas the risk-free option would compound very quickly leading to large returns in the long run, despite a lower expected value per round.

Personally I think that $1bn figure is way off. Their calculation method is a very rose-tinted 'best-case' scenario imo. From their list of assumptions:


If someone wanted to 51% attack bitcoin, they could do it this way. If it is much lower than the cost that the website calculates, then this is the way they would choose to do it, not the more expensive way.
Regardless, I think even the lower estimate is too high. Why build 100% of the network's hashing power all at once? A malicious actor could start off with a modest 5-10% of hash power, then invest 100% of their block rewards in more hashes, regardless of whether or not it's profitable. The bitcoin whitepaper envisaged the difficulty adjusting economically alongside technology, with miners dropping out and the difficulty plateauing as mining becomes unprofitable, but what if someone doesn't care about profit? They would gain hashpower as a percentage for every miner that dropped out. Everyone else would have to also not care about profit to keep that person from eventually amassing all the hash power. Anyone with the capability to manufacture competitive ASICs has the ability to carry out this 'constrictor' attack. If they make really efficient ASICs and have cheap electricity, it might not even cost anything at all.
It's possible that the only thing stopping an attack like this is that nobody hates bitcoin enough to carry it out.

Absolutely not. Anybody can run a tor exit node, and unless you use end-to-end encryption the exit node can read everything you send and receive. Sure they don't know who you are, but they don't need to, they can easily MITM you and take your bitcoins. Also, Tor traffic is much more likely than regular internet traffic to involve bitcoin transactions, and the hacker can easily remain anonymous, so it's the perfect place to do this.
Your advice is like saying to walk home from the bank via a network of dark alleys so nobody sees you.  To be perfectly clear: unless you are doing something illegal, DO NOT use Tor for bitcoin transactions.

I think you're underestimating governments' capacity for obfuscation. The US and UK governments managed to sell the Iraq war at the expense of ~$2tn and ~1,000,000 civilian lives. You might also want to read around the 40 year campaign of US govt lies to build a case for an invasion of Vietnam, at the cost of &gt;50,000 American lives and uncounted civilian casualties, although granted there was some backlash to that one when it got out.
Still, I think compared to these shenanigans, destroying Bitcoin would be a formality should they feel their current hegemony becomes threatened.

I originally read this in Warren Buffet's authorised biography years ago. A quick google search yielded this


It's not comprehensive but it's a kicking off point if you want to read further. With the banks it's reasonably obvious, they lost hundreds of billions in the financial crisis (technically they lost it in the leadup, we only knew about it when their hens came home to roost), obviously they didn't make hundreds of billions for their investors prior to that. Maybe for their managers...
The airline bubble (maybe you could call it a *market distortion* since the word bubble implies a short cycle) lasted &gt;60 years because of government interference, basically. They prop up inefficient businesses preventing market equilibrium from being reached for as long as they feel it is politically expedient.

1st paragraph fine, 2nd paragraph provably false. You're not thinking in distributed computing + decentralised terms, there is no "we", nobody to "instruct", no honest/rogue node distinction and you can't "just look at who owns 51%". Where the blocks come from will be irrelevant under the current system, clients will ignore all but the longest chain. If a 51% attack happens, it really will be game over for bitcoin in its current form.

Bubbles destroy wealth. Because with airlines (as with bitcoin) everyone assumed commercial flight was going to CHANGE EVERYTHING and therefore they had to be in at ANY price, every airline stock was overbought for a long time, and with their inflated valuations people lent them way more money than would be justified by their actual profitability. With so much cheap credit, an airline expands too much, maybe uses leverage to acquire competitors etc, but fails to make enough money to pay their debts, eventually going broke and filing for bankruptcy protection. Investors get wiped out, bondholders take a haircut, often the government steps in with a bailout so the taxpayer takes a hit too. (If this sounds familiar, banks have also lost more money than they've ever made at various points in their history, I'm not sure exactly where they stand now.) This actually happened with every major airline in America, as well as many flag-carrier airlines around the world.
Via price bubbles, money flows from investors, speculators and occasionally taxpayers to the management, employess, suppliers and customers of airlines (customers got flights for less than a sustainable business would have to charge them). It's possible (by no means certain) that through bitcoin, money is just moving from speculators to miners and power companies. Not saying that is what is definitely happening, but just thought I'd add a bit of balance given other commenters' possibly irrational exuberance.

Opportunity cost is not a real cost to someone out to destroy bitcoin.
Say you have a toll bridge and you make $10 a day from people crossing the bridge. It costs $9 to maintain.
Then some smartass invents a decentralised bridge that everyone can use instead of yours for a much lower cost of $1 per day in total to everyone. How much would you spend to get rid of the decentralised bridge and regain your bridge-opoly? NB. You also control the police and the courts and are the government.

Well blacklists go against the whole ethos of bitcoin, but even if we were to disregard that, I think in the event of a 51% such a solution would be like taking a fire extinguisher to the Hindenburg. Once someone has 51%, the number of destructive capabilities they'd have would quickly destroy the store of value aspect.
A plausible scenario: 51%-er carries on as normal with all transactions, but rewrites all blocks so that the block rewards go to them. Other miners might find a block once in a while but the attacker will just ignore and orphan it. The attacker will get ~80 btc an hour until the next retargeting, then 150btc an hour after that, while the rest of the miners will get nothing, ever. Miners will start to throw in the towel if they can't get back over 50% within a day or two at the most, and then it's a slippery slope til there's one entity in control of bitcoin forever.
Will people still use bitcoin as a store of value once they know it's under someone's total control? I personally doubt it.
Could a software patch come out to somehow ignore the attackers blocks within that 48hr window before legit miners give up? Maybe, but it's relatively easy to simulate millions of nodes, the devs would be playing whack-a-mole, meanwhile nobody will be buying hashes or mining hardware meaning it will get much cheaper and easier for the villain to keep up the attack.
Maybe bitcoin would not be 'destroyed', but without the store of value capability it'd probably go back to being 1000btc for $5 for a while. This is the main thing preventing a 51% attack imo, what good is 150btc an hour when they're practically worthless? However, bitcoin has some powerful enemies who might stand to benefit a lot if it disappeared, so I'm not sure how good a defense that will be in the long run.

Seriously? How about "Bitcoin is used for tax evasion, drugs, terrorism and child pornography"? "Bitcoin is a weapon of mass (financial) destruction"?
Also, hundreds of millions of dollars is an optimistic estimate in my opinion. By building up hashpower at only a slightly quicker rate than the rest of the network, a bad actor could potentially recoup most or all of their investment as they go. By routing their hashpower through a number of mining pools, they could keep their intentions under cover until they're ready to shut it down. Someone could have 51% already.
Even so, a hundred million dollars is 0.01% of the US federal govt's $1tn defence budget in 2013, or 0.005% of the money they spent on invading Iraq under false pretences, it'd amount to little more than a rounding error in the pentagon's budget. A 51% attack doesn't need to be done overtly either, as soon as any 6 confirmation transactions get reversed, all exchanges will clam up and the price of bitcoin will plummet below $1, along with all altcoins. Nobody need ever know where the longer chain came from. People who say the attack came from one of the TLAs will be labelled conspiracy theorists and the mainstream media smugstorm will suffocate all of us to death.
FWIW I agree that the US govt doesn't want/need to shut down cryptocurrency right now, I just think it'd be unwise to bet the farm on that in the long term.

Naturally you choose the higher return, but hotdog chooses the safe option.
After 1 year how are you doing? Well the chances of winning 365 flips in a row are effectively zero, so you're broke. Hotdog however is richer than rockerfeller and makes trillions more every day.

Firstly, I feel much happier replying to your second two posts. Your first replies saying "nonsense" and "completely baseless" felt incredibly disrespectful and I felt an angry emotional reaction to them. I don't know if you get into flame wars for kicks normally or what, but really I don't think it's much fun.
Secondly, I think saying "insurance will cover it" is just kicking the can down the road. I think that increased costs for the whole industry (cost of capital, higher insurance prices, extra costs for new security measures) will shift the supply curve and result in higher prices for the customer. I personally think the costs will land first at the feet of the affected banks' customers as they cut costs, but either way I think they filter through in the end.
Basically, in my humble opinion, security costs are an invariable part of the cost of a financial system of any kind, and they will be paid. Whether they're obfuscated and socialized and paid by the masses being nickel and dimed to death, or whether they're paid by the wealthy and the foolish, is the choice between the fiat system and a trustless decentralized system. In my opinion.
