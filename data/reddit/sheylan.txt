"Money is fungible" is a basic economic concept. It means that every dollar is worth the exact same amount as every other dollar.
If I don't have a gaming rig, how can I use my gaming rig for mining? :thinking:

Fungibility of money is sorta a corollary of oportunity cost. Instead of saying "every dollar you spent on this, you can't spend on that", you're saying "every dollar you have can be spent on this *or* that".
They're not exactly the same, fungibility is almost always talking about currency of some kind for one, but they're *very* tightly interwoven concepts, and can be somewhat interchangeable depending on what the subject is.

Fungability and oportunity cost are interrelated concepts. Fungibility is more specific than oportunity cost.
You need to take an econ 101 class. Terms like this are not easily understood based off the dictionary definition, esp for an ESL type.
Your rig was not paid for in 3 months.

It's relevant because 1 dollar spent on a gaming rig is 1 dollar that can't be spent on something else (tuition for a class, or gas money, etc).
$1000 is several months worth of disposable income for most people. That's not a trivial expense. And it's going to take a looooong time to pay back through mining, if it ever does (it won't).

If you want a tutor, pay me.

Aparently you slept through class... have a nice life.

Fungibility is a *type* of oportunity cost. That *is* the explanation.

Because not all gamers are crypto miners? And because money is fungible, and a 80% price jump on building a gaming rig is pretty non-negligable.

Between the RAM prices spiking and GPU price gouging it's damn near doubled the cost of building a decent rig. You used to be able to build a solid machine for under $700 pretty easily. That's turned into a $1000+ for a more or less entry level machine. A certain level of frustration is understandable.

Money fungibility is a subtype of oportunity cost. I was just being more specific than you. Again. Econ 101.
And by your own admission, you did not pay of your rig in 3 months.

No. Not even remotely. Azure's main customers are major commercial players. Enterprise level servers. Those customers are not going to swap to anything remotely decentralized for a long time, if ever. Nobody is going to run business critical services on a decentralized platform until the technology is extremely mature.

I actually agree with you, but feel compelled to quible over these two points. For point one, you really need to specify *personal/desktop computing*, because Linux/Unix totally dominates windows in the server and embedded computing markets.
And for point 2, Google's office suite is pretty close to being on-par with Microsoft Office at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:31:31
No they didn't. That hasn't been a thing in damn near 30 years, which is basically prehistoric. Hell, just look at Linux for an example of how enterprise companies can embrace open source software.

Have you seriously not heard of a little thing called "Azure"?
Second largest player in the IaaS field next too AWS (which is, admittedly, a fucking juggernaut, but 10% market share isn't exactly *bad*.)
Sure, Google won the search game, but Microsoft is a serious contender in the cloud infrastructure game, which matters way *way* more in the long term.
