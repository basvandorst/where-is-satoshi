This is exactly what I couldn't wrap my head around. It makes sense now though. Thanks for taking the time to explain it!

Thanks for the reply and I'll check out the video tomorrow. 


I was under the impression mining created the block of bit coins. So, you're saying a miner discovers/finds a bitcoin block through hashing and not create a block from their hashing?

I guess this is where my disconnect is, I'm viewing bitcoin as if it were a currency based off of a tangible something like when the dollar was on the gold standard.

Where does the economic value of a bitcoin come from?  Is it solely a perceived value or is there an actual value in hashing/bitcoin?
When I say perceived value, I'm thinking of materials like jewelry diamonds. They aren't actually rare but they are perceived to have worth because of a controlled market and advertising.  There's no real need for them.
When I say actual value, I'm thinking of materials such as copper/gold/iron/industrial diamonds which are all used as building materials. While the price does have a bit of a perceived aspect to it, there is quite a demand for those materials because they are needed to build/manufacture.
TL;DR Where does the value of bitcoin come from? Is there any value in hashing that gives value to bitcoin?
