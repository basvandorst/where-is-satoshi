Every single time I visit this sub, there's a similar post at the top telling me it's time to buy Bitcoin. Apparently the real news is when it's not time to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:02
Bitcoin isn’t a currency (too slow and expensive), it’s a store of value. I’ve seen businesses and things with “Gold” in the name.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:08:43
More realistically, Bitcoin needs to be replaced with a smarter alternative. Just as dial-up modems were replaced by broadband. It consumes far too much energy to be sustainable; only $250B in it yet it consumes more power than Denmark.
There’s a good future for cryptocurrencies either way. Bitcoin will be the coin that heavily popularizes it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:44:54
Bitcoin is no longer a viable currency; it’s now strictly a store of value. You comment makes little sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:36:23
Exactly, the horse and carriage (Bitcoin) was replaced by something superior. The crypto security and goal can be achieved much better with a more suitable coin. Bitcoin uses far too much energy and is far too slow and expensive. By your own logic, something much better should come around and replace it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:59:57
Facts do not equal ignorance. It can’t replace banks or fiat if it can’t be used as a currency. The lightning network is ages away, and might not be able to bring down fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:32:54
Bitcoin is now far too slow and expensive to serve that purpose though. 2+ years ago it was fine, but not anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:46
What of it? That’s no different than saying gold or old collectables are currencies.
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:09:11
Bitcoin is global, duh. Guessing you're American.
@_date: 2018-09-29 01:31:57
They do better than you.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:42:43
Probably this.

Mind explaining where listed that he sold in USD? And please don't say because a $ was used. Lol.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:59:50
Talk about linear thinking—it's a little thing called foreign exchange. 
Here's a current, real world example: if sold Bitcoin in Canada at $312 CAD (current exchange rate), this would translate to (give or take) $253.50 USD. Another example: I recently sold Bitcoin at $311 CAD, which is about $252.70 USD. Obviously I would write out the USD coin value I sold at on Reddit, because 95% of this subreddit's users are from the US and don't comprehend foreign exchange. 
I'm not saying got to $253 like this, I'm simply giving you an example that outlines the probability of my earlier point. Again, Bitcoin is global—I hope you comprehended. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 09:00:19
The real and only issue in my opinion is that 90% of humans use disgustingly easy passwords and don't have the competence for the much needed security involved with protecting a wallet. Almost everyone that has used Bitcoin has had a close call with losing them in some way. My tech savvy friend screwed up a paper wallet 2 days ago and lost $2K just like that. The safety will never be there, it will always be contended against by hackers and human ignorance. This is why large scale adoption is very unrealistic.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:34:44
Read the front page of the subreddit it Blockchain's announcement. You need to contact them.PS. All caps is only what &lt; 15 year olds use.

All banks and brokerages make a profit on Forex, many even go above 800 basis points on consumer transactions. Which is a robbery. That said, businesses taking a 2% commission on Bitcoin exchanges is still ridiculously high and greedy. But if liquidity isn't there, these start-ups have to make their profits somehow. That said, ATMs are providing a service that costs them money, so that's alright.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:45:54
Doesn't look like you can use Bitcoin if you're shipping to Canada. Just tried to buy some bed sheets with it, too bad. ;(

Small business extortion. They are very guilty for it.
[One of many articles.](

Check out my submitted history, I moved a decent amount of volume into Ðoge recently.
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:19:46
Are they allowing Canadian purchasing yet? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:30:18
This is fantastic news! You guys should also incorporate LTC (Litecoin)! Show your support for Cryptos and we'll show our support back! ;)
@_date: 2014-01-28 05:42:22
You might have missed my point. With a non-profit brokerage, it would be supported by donations, advertisements and minimal fees (much less than 1%). 
The reality is, these current middle-man brokerages are receiving huge profits (I've seen a monthly revenue report and it was in the millions), profits off of new adopters mostly. The Bitcoin foundation should be organizing a system that takes no profit, or just enough to curb potential volatility.

Bitcoin going under $300
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:14:05
My reasoning being that many of these consenting adults are incompetent and don't realize they have alternative options. They just want to get in on the coin due to media and disregard the high margin entry fee. I've seen it many, many times. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:58:59
The ad above it is even more ridiculous.

I've been tipped over $55 bucks in Dogecoin in just a week and I never even asked for anything. Not dust to the majority, hence the craze.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:29:48
The most important reason in my opinion, is that all currencies need a trading pair. People need options that are serious. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:40:15
This is not a bug and the decision to keep it was for the greater good of Ðogecoin to act like a real currency and not be hoarded. Not to mention that the inflation is a smaller percentage than BTC and LTC until like yr 2020. Go read the Ðogecoin subreddit, there are some indepth posts that analyze this. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 17:57:11
Or Mac. Don't know why you singled out Windows PC. My buddy lost about 13 BTC due to a key logger on his Mac a year back, want to make sure people know that malicious software is equally present on all operating systems (relative to their userbase).

That is a horrendous article with an obviously biased opinion. 
Altcoins are no more a bubble than Bitcoin is. The same argument can be had for Bitcoin. Always remember MySpace and Facebook, what ever is most popular will continue to trend upwards. Nothing is impossible.
Also, Dogecoin offers an extremely passionate and talented community that is growing at a much faster rate than any other coin. I overheard some colleagues at work talking about it, when I joined in, they had not even heard of Bitcoin. This coin is going nowhere and I feel that it is still undervalued in relation to it's priceless community.
Litecoin is also pretty swell. It has a professional image, some small perks over Bitcoin and it provides people with another option. Modern day humans in nature would go mad without many options, and Litecoin is the perfect alt-option. Although I do feel Dogecoin is much more lively and may catch up and overtake

Except not.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:33:16
Ah shit. I was being sarcastic. Haha. While what you say is true, there were multiple causes for the rise and crash of the Bitcoin's price. My entire point in this is simple, Mt. Gox was just another *contributing* factor. They are not solely responsible.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:45:47
Solely because of Mt. Gox, eh? Bold statement. Haha. I'm not going to bother here honestly.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:23:58
Assumptious at best. Anything can happen. I said &lt; $300 back when the price was $600, I was told the same thing. Miners leave, difficulty drops, everything regulates itself; aka, don't be a fool.
Edit: Typo
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:43:49
You'd be amazed at the power of fear. If Bitcoin's original large bubble went from $1160 to $150, then it's certainly possible for this current value to dip back to $800-2K. The "stable" value is currently in the air, this is clearly a huge hype train right now, similar to how people buy into the lottery 50x more when it reaches peak payout value.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:26:55
Desperation at its finest. 


Also, **my** loss and theft of an "original" idea. What the hell are you even talking about? Wait, please don't waste my time by answering that. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:37:59
You can't please them all. I can't even imagine how many thousands of requests they got to ban a sub like that. They likely wanted to clean Reddit's image of that sub, since it climbed in viral popularity.
I completely understand your point, banning the sub was a terrible move towards Redditor's freedoms... but it's still a business at the end of the day.
I really don't see how this is a reason to ditch the platform that has entertained us for years, and I especially don't see why we should be running towards a rip-off clone written in .net with mediocre code. Their scalability issues will be around until they redevelop the site, or receive millions in funding. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:33:18
Could also go &lt; 100. Just saying, anything is possible.
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:14:35
If one is concerned about an idea being stolen, that would mean that they assume that their idea is unique to them. How do you not process such a basic notion?
Nobody was talking about the extremes of placing a recording device except you, meaning you completely failed to comprehend the 'issue'. What an outrageously moronic and unrealistic angle you took to try making a very desperate point.
Any idea transformed into a business, which of couse is then made public to customers, can be copied. The idea is worthless, it's all about execution. There is no such thing as a unique business idea in today's world, so when someone becomes angry over a 'stolen' idea, that just means they are too incompetant to execute at a higher standard and capacity than the supposed 'thief' that took the idea.

@_date: 2015-07-06 06:57:26
You're taking this way out of context. Also, in relation to a business, if an idea cannot be patented, then it is worthless. I think of roughly 5 new businesses a day (it's an exercise), some of them are very clever, or so **I** think they are. I certainly don't assume any that of my ideas are unique due to my creative thinking, that would be insane.
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:33:05
No valuable ideas... Are you assuming that you know absolutely everything about me?
Everyone *parrots* this mantra because it's the hard truth.
And by the way, my businesses that I run are and always will be 100x more successful than any of your *ideas*. Good luck out there, newbie.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:01:10
Thanks tips. I'm glad you're filling in the holes for me.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:18:47
This. Ideas hold zero value, execution is all that matters. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:39:24
Considering you're just an idea guy. Let's bump that up to 200x.
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:30:07
There are billions of people on this earth; if you believe that any business idea is genuinely unique, then you are lost. Those with the best execution win, welcome to capitalism.
@_date: 2015-07-27 00:11:59
If this all works as described, then we're looking at a huge step forward for Bitcoin. Bitcoin business directories would no longer be necessary, for the most part.
