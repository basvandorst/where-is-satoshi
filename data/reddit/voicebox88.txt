Depends if no deal or not.  I reckon a delay will happen, so no effect this year

This time reminds me of last year when BTC dropped from 6K to 3k.  Everyone was calling for 2k and 1k.... but it never happened and started its climb.  I’m not saying that will necessarily happen now, but know one knows. Sentiment is overly bearish, which means a break up could happen

Basically the video says that the entire bitcoin history has been one massive Elliot wave anding with the 2017 bull run.  According to the Elliot wave pattern, an ABC correction must take place.  The bear market we’ve had for the last year, can be seen as wave A of the correction and the current bullish rally, the Wave B.
The video states that Wave C will be coming in the next year and either we will double top at 20k and slowly head back to 3k for a double bottom before taking on new heights, or could potentially drop lower than 3k (if we are in a zig zag correction).
Do you think this is viable?  It’s hard to argue with some one with expertise and who is looking long term and at the whole of BTCs history.  But the sentiment is very bullish right now and with the halvening happening next year, I don’t see how it could go this low?
However, the very fact that the sentiment is so bullish right now could be a sign we are about to head to new lows....

I never thought I’d lose all my money through investing.
Bitcoin fixes this.
