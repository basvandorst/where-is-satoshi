Whoever has access to that wallet are involved with fraudulent transactions and no serious exchange or service should have that many btc in a hot wallet.

A friend uses their software and helped me out.

Hot vs cold wallet has more to do with how the private key is stored and accessed so maybe it was wrong of me to claim that this looks like a hot wallet. Next time I will check some definitions before I claim something. This page has a good definition I guess:

I just posted another reply on the same topic. I was wrong claiming that the amount of transfers would indicate how the private key is handled. It could be either hot or cold wallet since we don't know how the private key is stored and handled.

Maybe depends on the definition of hot vs cold wallet. But bitcoin is being transferred away from this wallet several times per day. Each time requires that the private key is used to sign the transaction. That is typically a hot wallet to me.

I have got some new info from a friend. It sure seems like this is a OKCOIN cold wallet since over 90% of the incoming transactions are from other known OKCOIN wallets. What is still interesting is that almost 7% of all outgoing transactions goes to MMM. In general it seems that much of incoming bitcoin to MMM comes from Chinese exchanges, for example more than 11% comes from Huobi exchange.

You are right. It seems like all the fraudulent transactions that are happening later are the users own transactions. Not necessarily connected to OKCOIN cold wallet.

Simple google search returns some interesting results:
It sure seems like this address is involved in many different scam sites.
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:16:26
Well actually that one is :) just google the address and you will see. But it is not a "real" onion adress.
@_date: 2016-04-29 10:22:03
But still, isn't it strange that transaction has gone straight from OKCOIN cold wallet to scam-sites offering to "multiply your bitcoins within 24 hours"?

Some more info on the MMM ponzi scheme

The source hank says it is OKCOIN.COM COLD WALLET. That would explain the enormous amounts. Thanks for that link :)
@_date: 2016-04-29 11:11:32
That is interesting. Were they referring to hot wallets only maybe? Since this is a cold wallet they might have other policies?

Is this a joke? I really can't figure out if this guy is trying to be serious or just joking. He says "...all the way to 36 cents and then it crashed down to 21 cents." I would have been very happy buying any amount at that "peak" of 36 cents and keep the bitcoins through all the "crashes". Selling those bitcoins now would be 685 times the money. So the moral of the story really is, ALWAYS buy bitcoin since in the long run value will increase.

It seems that there is a problem of hardware failure on the LocalBitcoins.com server :( The site has been down for about 20 hours already.

I have no idea what countries that supports M-PESA or Tigo Pesa. I think you can even use Skrill to send M-PESA (
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:56:58
Buy with M-PESA or Tiga Pesa from my good friend Thomas in Tanzania :)

Unless they cut one piece at a time it is most likely 16. You cut it first in half, then 1/4, then 1/8 and finally 1/16. It makes no sense they would cut 17 pieces.
