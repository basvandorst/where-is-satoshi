You can kinda see all that here:

You can switch to Segwit without creating a new wallet so your seed words stay the same just the coins needs to be moved.

Imagine what the bcash brigade and the media will say. Yeah they can say whatever they want, but it's still not a good idea to give them munition. Seems way to early for mainnet.

How the hell would tether be used by money launderers?

Take the IBAN of Chase bank from Kraken's deposit page and look it up on iban.com to see the exact bank name.

Do you mean the fee expressed as sat/byte needs to be higher for transactions with multiple inputs? Isn't a 230 byte single input tx with 100 sat/byte fee be the same as a 500 byte multiple input tx with a 100 sat/byte?

Just until bitcoin becomes "cold hard cash", and doesn't needs to be exchanged to Fiat.

Is it currently possible to send from bech32 to any kind of address, like a coinbase deposit address?

What do you mean?

And Gemini still uses uncompressed addresses, bloating the blocks further.

No backup of the seed extraction method?

Maybe Child Pays For Parent can help.

Based on the plummeting price, people might be  willing to pay high fees to trade those coins and flee the market.

What were your reasons on switching to Doge?

So how did you back it up?

Boot from Ubuntu live CD, install latest Electrum, disconnect internet, restore wallet from seed, save xpub key to usb stick, reboot to your normal OS and reconnect internet, restore watch only wallet from xpub, create tx sending from cold wallet to HW wallet, save it to usb or CD, reboot to ubuntu live cd with internet disconnected, install latest Electrum, restore from seed, load tx from the USB, sign it, save it, reboot to normal OS and reconnect internet, broadcast signed tx.
After BTC arrived to HW wallet do the above again but with Electron client instead of Electrum.

Tails has Electrum version 2.9.3, but it will be able to get the xpub key from your seed without ever connecting to the net, saving you some steps, good idea.

On Bisq you have to have bitcoins or other base crypto to buy bitcoin.

Not even that method will work if the attackers wait for a confirmation.
