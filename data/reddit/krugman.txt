Central banking will never die because the smartest people in the world, people like me, believe in it very sincerely. I'm never wrong either, as all of my interns are required to tell me daily.

I think it's cute how people still worry about legal/illegal.

I got banned for heroically advocating for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, two of the holiest offices in the American church. They're a capricious lot over at that subreddit.

So if I'm hoarding comic books society should also penalize me? What about gold and silver coins, baseball cards, violin bows and other commodities that occasionally serve as currency?
Your premise is an incorrect one. Why should the society of moneylenders penalize people for holding onto their product?

You're engaging in enough auto-idiocy for the both of us. Thanks for taking up the slack.

I'm doing my best over there. ; )

Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme because my friend Ben Bernanke told me so. He's almost as smart as I am but I have more hair.

How am I going to sell my bullshit books and get on TV if Bitcoin keeps growing?

Those guns were bought and paid for with what you call my friend Ben Bernanke's "shitpaper". He's a very nice man and his paper works to buy goods and services all over the world, including these guns and those that wield them.
You need to learn to speak more respectfully of your masters.

Just holding cash will make you lose money. What cost $1000 in the year 2000 would run ~$1280 today. Inflation in action. Even the difference between 2010 dollars and 2011 dollars is about 10%: 


I put a thousand dollars into bitcoin when it was at ~$5 and have been buying ever since. I've kept ahead of the inflation of the paper currency using bitcoin. No one holding cash can say that.

I've made money on bitcoins. I've lost money on the dollar/American debt. You do the math.
@_date: 2012-12-15 17:25:04


You must be speaking of American debt.

You've just proven my original point. Gracias.
