QT is the client the core team has developed. "Default" just goes along with it. Sure, there are plenty of alternatives but the dev team hasn't really innovated the client much since SN left.
I'm familiar with Bitcoin-otc. Would love to see it within a client with proper safeguards. Then it wouldn't be centralized on a server somewhere.
The only reason the small team of devs would not have much funding atp is because they've burned through it. It seems to me they may be "maintainers" of the code versus "innovators" with the code. I miss Satoshi.

Calling all bitcoiners, crypto-evangelists, libertarians, entrepreneurs and wholesalers... This product is for you!
We created this product not only to help start up conversations across campuses worldwide but to also provide a First-to-Market product at wholesale pricing. By grouping our pre-sale batches in orders of 600, 1200 and even 2400 we can manufacture a custom umbrella and pass on the savings at great discounted prices.
We imagine this umbrella will sell for a range of $39.99 to $49.99 in the open market. We currently are offering these at ~~$33.75~~ **$24.99, a 35% savings!** If you sell on sites like eBay or Amazon buying bulk orders of these will relay into nice profits down the road. This is a First-to-Market product and sure to become an instant classic!
This is a "pre-sale" item. Once we reach 300 units sold we'll place the order with our manufacturer. These are custom made for us and the lead time is 65-90 days. In the meantime we are distributing Counterparty UMBRELLA tokens with each order which can be traded on their decentralized exchange up to our shipping date.

he's  on a fork of the Bitcoin codebase which is Particl Core. However, Particl stays up to date with Bitcoin Core updates since their genesis on Bitcoin 0.14.2 and currently on 0.16.0. 
So technically Particl's and specifically tecnovert's work with CT and RingCT and ColdStaking etc could migrate back to Bitcoin's if at some point it's deemed worth enough privacy enhancements for the mother code. 
Each branch is in-sync together plus with Particl's also adding the privacy enhancements. PART is PoS and BTC PoW so they make good compliments to each other rather than competitors.

Bitcoin trades fall under Capital Gains / Capital Losses.
You need to report those. 
**For example:** You make 100k in 2015 trading BTC, that needs to be reported as a Capital Gain. However, you also lost 125k in 2015 trading XRP, that needs to be reported as Capital Losses. And last, you made 30k in 2015 pumping then dumping CRAVE. That is also reported as a Capital Gain. 
When you do the math, (100,000 - 125,000 + 30,000) you end up with $5,000 that needs to be reported and taxed for 2015.

You guys are so stubborn over here. Shadow (built on btc codebase) has 1 public token and 1 private token. This tech has been open source for nearly 9 months. The public token acts the same as traditional bitcoin token, providing the same level of anonymity. The private token uses a modified ring signatures algo based on Adam Back and Andy Toshi's work ( to completely break trace-ability/ track-ability. 
TLDR; breaking the trace on your coins can happen within your own wallet, by yourself (no mixers or 3rd party) by swapping your public tokens for private (1:1) and then back again. Block times are 90 secs so do the math.

The taste of beef jerky is like a river. The river flows from a source, it carves the land and is amplified by smaller channels. It is depleted by plants and animals which grow up around the river. When a natural event occurs which channels more water into the river, it may flood and cause damage. If this flooding is anticipated it can be harnessed, resulting in fertile land. The river searches for equilibrium due to a force of nature, gravity. When understood, the river can be utilized for economic gain. Approached carelessly, the river will sweep you away. Predators lurk behind the grass waiting for a thirsty noob to dunk their head in, waiving their juicy butt meat into the air. The water which flows seems endless, what is the point in claiming and defending a section of this river when it is dangerous, volatile, and flows forever? Did you know that water falls from the sky?

Bitcoin as an organization has become to political and lethargic to implement anything innovative like ring sigs. 
Ouch, that hurt my ears to say out loud.

I'm not saying do it. I'm saying  
They will reverse whatever you contest and yes, it will be free. And you just stole from someone else but Paypal has no comment about it. Their platform and terms of service allow this type of criminal conduct. If it's digital they will reverse it, 100% of the time.

Initially it was just a decision by the code writers. But over time it became an identifier of Bitcoin specific addresses. As other builds of the open source code developed into Alternative Crypto Currencies each new variation chose a different starting number/letter to identify their specific addresses. Litecoin addresses start with L for example.
Some currencies like Peercoin also use 1 as their identifier for addresses so users need to be careful and aware of the variations out there.

Yes that's stealing. That's why I'm not condoning it. 
Paypal doesn't do enough due diligence to prove if reversals are fraudulent however. Once they see "Digital goods" they reverse it because the credit card companies are going to reverse it.

* Jules Winnfield: Okay, so, tell me about the hash bars.
* Vincent Vega: So what you want to know?
* Jules: Well, hash is legal there, right?
* Vincent: Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean, you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. They want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
* Jules: Those are hash bars?
* **Vincent: Breaks down like this, okay:** it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't really matter 'cause, get a load of this, all right; if you get stopped by the cops in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
* Jules: [laughing] Oh, man. I'm going, that's all there is to it. I'm fucking going.
* Vincent: Yeah, baby, you'd dig it the most.

Yes that rebound effect is historically true. It's not a BTC killer scenario. However, historical crashes with Bitcoin have always seen a revisit to whatever low it hit at least one more time after the crash and sometimes multiple times. The $260+ -&gt; $60+ crash this spring 2013 showed a revisit of $60-80's prices a couple times before the gradual rise started again. 
A selloff of a good % of BTC in existence with no abandon or self remorse like the FBI **WILL DO** once the case is closed will clear nearly all of the BUY orders on the largest exchanges and a drop that tremendous will have ripples for a while. Bitcoin will recover and find it's price again but the true question is: Will it's chances of mass adoption recover from that?
Put your bids in now and forget it. Hopefully luck will be on your side and you can become the US Gov's  fan. I plan on the first part of that statement but the end... not so much!

In terms of valuation:
* A selloff of the FBI owned Bitcoins from raids aka: DPR will tank the price.
* Widespread adoption failing could cause price to be "worthless" versus the current prices
In terms of the protocol (concept of Bitcoin):
* Nothing. The concept of Bitcoin and what the blockchain and P2P network can do is the real "value" of the system. It can't be stopped.
