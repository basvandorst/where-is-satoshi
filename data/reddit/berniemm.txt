Cost basis isn't carried over? (assuming I know it)

Say I sell at the same price as the cost basis, there is no gain or loss and the gift is valued under 14k USD. Do I have any reporting obligations?

Child and slave labor, even better!

What if the gift is under the $14,000 limit or whatever the IRS has it set at?

If I were you I would have conned her into liquidating all their assets by now, but that's just me.

Reported you, this does not contribute any meaningful discussion. No wait, I didn't because reporting people is pointless busy-body shit.

If all you feel like is an idiot you are doing alright. Give that ol' wife one last pump then dump. When btc comes back you'll be all set.

Tell her to lick your ponzi hole.

Your wife sounds like a fontas pump dump ponzi scheme. Let her leave and consider it a blessing. Also, why on earth would you buy so hard at the top?

It's actually bukkake.

What kind of dicks have you been looking at recently?

Half a penny a word?! what a cheapskate! If bitcoin allows you to rip someone off better I don't consider that a good thing, although I do agree with the rest of what you said. Please pay your writer more or write yourself, half a penny a word is an insult.
