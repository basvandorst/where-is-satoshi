Hi, there. Thank you so much for being interested in esports! I recommend to invest the  into sponsoring an existing project and working with existing tournaments, rather than setting up a smaller tournament. I'd be happy to talk to you about your options for what budget you had in mind. Based on that, would be happy to introduce you to a couple of options. I will send you a PM with my contact details.  
For your reference, I organized Alienware Cup last year, which set the record for highest concurrent viewers for an online-only tournament. I am a consultant for event, social media, community, content and talent management. Twitch is a current client. I've worked with multinationals, like MasterCard and Dell. I've been playing Dota for ten years and working in gaming for seven years.
Given the vast number of high profile tournaments, and even more multiple smaller scale tournaments. The most value per dollar spent is gained from high profile tournaments. With regards to the [original comment about Dota 2]( it might not be as simple as explained.
* It generally will cost more than just the prizepool if you want to ensure it is done right, especially if you want to work with the best.
* Top teams will only play if it is attractive to them, fits in their schedule and if the tournament design is good. Even with top teams, if it clashes with another high profile tournament, numbers will be about halved.
* Applying for an in-game Dota TV ticket/bundle is possible. Sales of this will depend highly on the teams, the bundle and the casters.
* A community funded prize pool from the Dota TV ticket/bundle sales has only been granted for high profile LAN tournaments. If it is not automatically calculated as a community funded prize pool, the organizer could commit the money earned from ticket/bundle sales, but it wouldn't be easily tracked.
