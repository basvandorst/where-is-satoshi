Why is there no reference on the overwhelming support that 8chan has received from Bitcoin users/wallets?  (total received $ 8,648.57, $ 4092 received just this past May) If they are that big and there is no reference on r/Bitcoin, does it mean we are ashamed of this?

Women don't want to be degraded in order to join this community though it seems that's what you are advocating?
What has various boxes to do with feminism that gave women the right to vote?

It's not intelligent to keep digital Bitcoin money all on the web at the hands of some other person. When my money is held temporarily on a money exchange I don't blame anybody if that money is lost, and it's probably 20$ worth of Bitcoin anyway so why bother? What you do is to be extremely irresponsible, then you blame that irresponsibility on somebody else. Sorry but that's public stupidity.
