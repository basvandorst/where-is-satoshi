the knee-jerk 'personal offense' angle is what Newsweek is going to use to deflect criticism on the story, man
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:33:29
you should see the tweets I've sent  &amp; her ( No, really, go look it up. My SN matches my handle. But for real, I'm trying to see if there is ANYWAY this can not trainwreck-itself and be a negative for BTC PRICES, dingus! The worse BTC community skewers her, the worse future articles on the community will be ==== less $$ in the long run
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:21:09
At no point do I condone what she did, or the information she put out there, or how she went about doing it -- I think the bottom line for accountability falls on Newsweek, as they're the publisher and outlet for the story (&amp; I hate Newsweek!)

Whether I worry about Nakamoto/his fate doesn't matter. What's done is done, and I sincerely hope that nothing horrible happens to him, because that was my initial reaction. What we do now, how we react, &amp; how the BTC community appears DOES
edit: What happens to Nakamoto is out of our hands. His private life is over. Earlier I was tweeting at Leah 'Nice $400M hit job!' but then I thought, hey, wtf, Newsweek should NOT have let this happened in the first place
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:37:13
Fuck Newsweek. Have Leah do an AMA to make everything look on the up and up. &amp; leave Satoshi alone! (you watching live updates? They're chasing him in a car, they got a vid of him up. This whole thing is crazy)

Anyone w/ the slightest hint of the BTC community would have known this was not going to run well. In the vid. she acts like she had no idea--which may or may not be true, but still, I believe Newsweek is the most flagrant offender of irresponsibility in this case. It was up to them to tell her to revise/not to run it, now they're just going to develop the story to get more views, while squishing her
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:23:20
She's already wearing thin. You watch the vid? +Rep to the bitcoin community if we don't self destruct on this. Otherwise it's negative press for BTC because of the backlash…HELLO! I'm talking to your wallet w/ this one
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:13:08
like…$400M in "risk"...
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:24:41
Everyone here understands this, right? BIG backlash makes the community look bad, lowers prices, discourages new users---I'm not happy with the article, but I'm okay w/ a shitty article instead of DRIVING BTC PRICES DOWN
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:07:35
It's not the same person, all previous attempts at identifying /pinpointing Satoshi were widely speculated
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:13:19
I think that's what kills me on this. A small adjustment, &amp; no negative PR/Satoshi would be fine. Would have added another dimension of mystery/intrigue to the whole thing

@_date: 2014-03-06 20:51:32
yes, let's focus on anger, rather than improving BTC/making the most of this
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:31:08
Naive? Maybe. Expecting a nuanced response form a (smarter than most) BTC community? --&gt; "It'll end badly, I guarantee it"
