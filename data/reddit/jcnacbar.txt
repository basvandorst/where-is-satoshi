Everyone has been waiting on $8K. Therefore, it either wont' get there because big buyers will front run, or it will blow right through. There is 0% chance that EVERYONE will have an opportunity to buy at $8k and perfectly time the bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:37:05
This is possible now with TT, underlying crypto not just futures.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:29:27
I think that this specific case is probably coincidence, you can't blame wall street for everything lol. But you are correct in thinking that they are and will be linked. As bigger money flows into Bitcoin the two will be correlated as money moves into and out of risk assets.

For those who don't know, a Canadian TFSA is a tax free account where you don't have to claim capital gains :) That said, there is a yearly contribution limit, and you also can't claim capital losses.

I don't fully understand it, but my concern is that people are holding and trading much greater balances of USDT than whatever USD amount was originally deposited into the exchanges. I might be wrong, but consider the following scenario. Two people both fund bitfinex with $1000 worth of USD. So they both have $1000 USDT in their account available for trade. Both buy BTC at $10k and it rises to $20k. Person A decides to sell at $20k. Person A then has $2k USDT. Price comes back to $10K and person B sells. Price is unchanged from where it started but their combined tradable balance is now $3k USDT, more than they funded originally. I understand that for everyone making money there is someone else on other end losing money, but consider that many people DON'T fund these exchanges with USD/EUR but rather another crypto such as LTC or ETH and USDT needs to be created every time a USDT pair trades.

Yes you are correct. However, there is a big difference physiologically between $2000 and $8000. Especially for all of the new people who were primarily the ones buying since September. In other words it shakes people more and they are less likely to come in a week later and bid the market up.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:16:31
I don't understand why there is so much selling pressure at $14,400. It doesn't have significant volume support and it's not even a physiological number. There have now been 5-6 attempts to break through. It's must be a fight between large buyers and sellers, but why this line in particular baffles me.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:22:02
This. Why people keep watching/reading it is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:07:24
Of course, it's called a limit order. You'll see them in the books far below market price. I had one set at 12k :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:15:37
Welcome to the financial markets, cyrpto has become the very thing it should not have, the stock market lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:23:35
Also, the daily chart looks awful compared to September. We haven't had a reversal day on high volume yet like we did then. I'm not trying to be a bear, just pointing it out :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:46:10
Here we are yet another day later, and still struggling at $14,400. I'm walking away for a week I don't care if I miss a move lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:32:39
Well if they were margin trading more than they owned with no stops or hedges then that was their fault not Bitfinexs. I was long on margin that day and didn't lose everything.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:45:04
Yes 12/21 had a nice V bottom and reversed but it still closed well below the open.  Most importantly, we did not have any follow through and we've been met with resistance ever since. I'm really waiting for a day like we saw on 09/15!!
Hey I hope you're right, I'm adding to my position here ;)
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:09:32
No, turn off the log chart and it's obvious that the scale is just a tad bit more severe than September. It could end up the same, rallying from here, but I'll wait for confirmation on the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:00:52
I don't think so, the futures have light volume, are cash settled, and have high margin requirements right now
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:09:24
No, not if your money is still in bitcoin, that's not revenue it's still paper gains. If you sell some to make a transaction, then that is a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:09:37
Also, please be humble people, not everyone has made enough money to change their lives so it's pretty daft when people create threads gloating about it.  Especially the ones about material possessions, nobody cares what you bought. Would you want someone who makes twice as much as you always telling you about what cars they bought or what vacations they're going on?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:02:05
As a trader, I can say that the price action has completely changed lately. The upwards price trends are much shorter lived. I hope (but I do not know) that this will change soon.

He also got a bailout, so it's easy for him to say..

The bitcoin exchanges don't, they're amateur. The futures will facilitate this, check out ninjatrader + jigsaw
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:59:37
Yep, you're effectively trading two currency pairs  simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:04:29
This is because greed and corruption are human qualities, crypto just got popular and attracted these people. A financial market free of these qualities is a pipe dream at this point, it could only exist in the early days when the participants had a common goal and no substantial money at stake.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:43:07
Withdraw what, BTC or dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:39:24
Seriously, buy a pizza, just replace the Bitcoin you spent. If Bitcoin is to be widely adopted people need to spend it not just trade it among themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:36:12
Correction sir, "Wall St. is licking their lips, ready to TRADE in massive quantities at any point". Big difference. This is also assuming that the deal is approved, which it won't be if we keep experiencing such high levels of volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:01:31
What market are you referring to, crypto or the stock market? If the market crashes, of course bitcoin would be affected, but in the end I think it could attract a lot more people looking to protect their assets.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:59:17
I think it's an OK time, better than a few days ago anyways LOL
Need to be careful catching a falling knife though
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:15:52
How has eth not moved at all during this? I would have thought it would be a bit of a safe haven...
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:36:52
I understand, it's not the role of the currency itself. Are there any good ones available?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:50:26
Different models can be implemented, what you're referring to is a custodial model and yes it's already being done.  Those in custody of other peoples keys must be trustworthy, but they aren't 'banks' because they may only have the power to sign your transactions not control them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:23:24
Don't feel too bad, I saw an offer of $700,000+ getting filled on the books yesterday when price was falling. That guy either knows what's up, or he's shitting himself right now lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:25:12
If Tether ends up being not backed 1:1 (no evidence of that, don't want to scare anyone), and people have actually been buying/trading with paper money, then it most certainly will have a PROFOUND effect on the price.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:28:31
This is honestly something people need to think about.  God forbid anything happens to you, your family will not be able to get access to your funds unless you share this info with them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:13:44
It's all cash settled, they'll find a way, and use huge leverage to do so. I think most people under estimate the volume and power of institutional trading. They don't care what direction price moves, the sell side always wins.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:18:29
Notice the similarities between the Bitcoin chart and the market index charts like Dow Jones. If people lose jobs and need money then discretionary to investments are the first to sell off. That said, I believe Bitcoin will be more resilient.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:32:59
Traders pull this stuff all the time, since the crypto markets are unregulated and it's not illegal to do so, we need to get used to it or find a way to stop it (not really possible even in traditional markets). It's not great for the long term stability of the currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:27:31
I think you'll find many people here with (in my opinion) an unhealthy percentage of their net worth invested. Very few people seem to be limiting their risk, but it is pretty exciting and I see very little else these days worth investing in.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:19:41
Usually big price movements (eg away from btc) are confirmed across multiple assets. This is very one sided which tells me something
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:13:47
How would that work? I see the transaction of funds appear in my wallet, ship the product, but the contract is not completed until they receive the product and sign it?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:15:29
Never heard of it, I'll check it out. I can only sell my item in a forum though because it's a specialty hobby, a niche market. Think model airplane parts and you've got the idea.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:39:25
I would not sell the ONLY physical money in the entire world. I would keep that as a token, to each his own.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:19:38
Where are you seeing this?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:47:00
It's not surprising, but why has the MSM continually had this bias and tone? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:20
Many people seem to forget that Bitcoin is truly global, it's $12,400 Canadian right now. It makes trading on the exchanges a bit of a challenge because we have to convert between two floating currencies, oh well.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:45:37
Until the CME futures start trading lol careful what you wish for...
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:48:10
So who's buying right now?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:40:03
Where do you live, or are you basing this on what you're reading here? I don't know anyone personally who has money invested who isn't in it for the right reasons, in fact most people I know have been using it for more than five years. I would agree that the sentiment on the internet is as you've described. This is how flash crashes happen, because people get spooked and since they don't actually care about the underlying asset/tech/company they just sell in a panic with everyone else tripping over each other.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:41
Are you serious? lol
Invest, save, spend it on things you want... it's money.
Don't trade it unless you know what you're doing.
Most important, learn what it's all about.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:25:25
In Canada we have a huge housing and debt bubble too. There's literally no where safe to store money these days.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:40:59
Why were you under that impression? It says right on the website that it's not.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:22
Everyone was sad that they missed an opportunity to buy before it went to $11k, now that it's at $9.5K again those same people are afraid to buy it lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:45:13
With our electricity costs? Not so sure there's a point. Glad people are running nodes though :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:54:01
Watch this, they cover what your describing
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:31:01
If it's at record highs then they sell existing positions into it and make money. If it's at record lows then they create naked shorts and make money. Institutional traders don't have 100% of their capital tied up in one position like everyone here does, so they can hedge and control positions. Anyways, I don't really have a point other than that they are capable of manipulation if that is what they wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:33:46
Will it though? Can someone explain to me how the exchanges work in this respect..On the weekend I was buying and selling btc/USD without issue even with 160k outstanding blockchain transactions. So when does my transaction actually hit the chain, do the exchanges settle at some point?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:08:10
I'm pretty sure I downloaded it from their site, they should have a link. I remember filling it in then emailing it back.
It's part of the verification process when you first click on Funding.

If you guys ARE trading, then you're not trying hard enough with your monitors! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:45:22
Are you trading it, if not then why do you care so much? Are you worried or just excited? It's a called a dopamine addiction, and it's the same reason we check out mobile phones constantly for new texts, you should really put the screen away for a few days and enjoy your life, take the wife out!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:12:50
I knew this must be the case. So if I fund with USD, buy BTC, hold for a month then sell back to USD, that transaction never hits the blockchain? When do they add to cold storage only when someone funds to the BTC wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:01:32
Central Ontario 8-18 cents

I must agree, as a relative newcomer to this subreddit (but not Bitcoin), the posts have really put me off. It's all fiat price, trading, politics, one sided opinions and flip flopping trends. I've seen several brilliant posts but they're getting lost in the memes and Twitter feeds. If I want to read about other crypto currencies I'll go to their respective subs.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:23:32
You should be! It's frightening to think about.

This is related, fast forward a bit to 11min.
It's really an argument of scalability, contention and centralization of the network.

Well he was almost right.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:44:20
For every buyer, there is a seller. When you buy from an exchange etc. there's someone on the other end selling it to you. Supply is limited from the miners. So my question for this sub is, who is selling? Certainty not the core believers, you guys will never sell, so who?
