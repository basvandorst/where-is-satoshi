I mean you can always set the minimum time to be something like 5 minutes even for 0 cost transactions, then use a non-decreasing function like a staircase function for large amounts.

I am from Crete. I believe that it is unlikely to spend bitcoin in Crete. Maybe you can book at least hotel and flight tickets online. Adoption is extremely low in Greece at the moment.

My wallet has no seed phrase I have a passphrase which is required when I send BTC. I think that Core does not have the option of seed mnemonic.

There are atm's but you spend BTC online most of the time. There are a few restaurants which accept bitcoin.  [

Based on Vitalik's response CSW said that gamma is negative! However 0&lt;γ&lt;1. Then CSW calls γ probability because he does know the definition of probability mass function or measure. He makes a series of mistakes.

That is the way for the most advanced applications. Another recent example is the alpha-zero by google. There is no scientific contribution, however, they combine existing knowledge (dynamic programming and reinforcement learning )  with the computational power of neural nets to create the ultimate chess player.

I tried it last night. To restore it I just replaced the old wallet with the "new" one (same wallet but later backup version). However, it didn't require to download the blockchain again. I assume that happened because it is the same wallet (identical private key).

I am just asking to write down what you are hearing... The content is not hard to be understood.

The service is irrelevant to the type of currency. That can also happen with cash if the transaction is recorded somehow.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:18:07
I know, I talking about the same address
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:55:15
ok I understand, it works. That's so cool! How is the address generated as a combination of the private, the public key and the seed phrase? Does this impose that there is a maximum number of addresses that you can have?
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:54:51
thank you I will have a look!  What do you mean it can not help? We might not apply it directly on the bitcoin protocol but how about constructing layers above it like the lighting network?

I just want to have the same wallet on desktop and laptop.

You should expect a drop below 8.5k then just buy some
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:08:58
Ok If there is any other update I will let you know.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:20:25
what do you mean back? back to my wallet? I did know that. How does this work and why does this happen?
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:14:07
Why don't you check the average transaction fee first? you can get an estimate of the cost and the time that takes for the transaction. Then choose what you prefer based on the average fee.

Just report the BCH for stealing the logo of BTC. Reason: Phishing and Scam!!!

Can someone explain what makes most of the currencies to drop 5 percent at the exact same time and in 20 minutes frame ? I understand that there is a high correlation but why does this happen at the exact same time?
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:33:00
ok, my goal was to learn some terminology and understand the response, I am new to crypto and I am studying papers.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:11:48
now it is 1.97 1.65 0.06 how does it change so fast? does the price change for every block?
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:04:27
that makes sense

Is it ok to create beforehand 20 addresses for future transactions to minimize the number of times that I will have to restore it? I can not see any problem with that but I am trying to understand how other people use their wallets.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:46:10
ok thanks, that makes sense. Since you can use so many addresses for sending and receiving why do people say that there is no privacy? Is there a way to match different addresses and conclude that they belong to the same wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:16:14
1) Create an account at a different bank 2)  buy the dip, 3) move the money to your wallet 4) learn about cold storage and have your own strategy to protect passphrase, keys, etc. Then hold.

exponential and parabolic trends are not healthy moves. We need a parabolic curve in the graph of education versus time.

In 10 years it will not matter if you bought at 12k or 6k because the price will be x1000 or /1000, and guess which of the two is more likely.
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:29:39
ok, I see, there is a set of parameters the hash rate, the cost to generate a single hash, the reward, the number of unconfirmed transactions,  the average transaction fee in x blocks, the price of BTC and more. I was trying to understand what happens if we can keep fixed all of them apart from two (the reward and the transaction fee). I  know that this is not a realistic scenario and none of them is constant over time, however, I would like to get a sense of their relationship. It might be interesting to fit a model based on the information that we have from the past, however, this could be hard because of the non-linear dynamics of the variables.
