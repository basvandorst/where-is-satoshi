As of writing this reply, there's 90,000 unconfirmed transactions. Has anyone noticed that btw? Every single time there's one of these 'record breaking' bitcoin events, transaction volume skyrockets. O_O

What if he destroyed his private keys? Now if he claims he's Satoshi people will think he's crazy lol

Worldwide financial crisis? lol.. have you any idea how big the world economy really is and more so; what it takes to cause even a minor crisis? BTC has a market cap of only $42B - that's comparable to a baby ant in a world as big as earth when you compare the world economy vs bitcoin.  
  
  
The only reason countries are regulating it is so that they can tax it appropriately and gain from it.

I think if bitcoin survives another 5 years and continues gaining adoption, it'll definitely (at some point in the future) hit $1M usd per coin.

It's fine. We're at 3.5 transactions per second; the network capacity is 7 per second. Might experience a delay in transfers though..

ehh.. needs to be more of a electrocution hazard if you ask me

Quite frankly, it's an issue with all major exchanges. Have you perhaps considered localbitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:27:02
Maybe. I personally like Litecoin - it has that vanilla bitcoin taste, just with added scalability :)

It makes no sense, it has to be some sort of false flag operation. Someone with a lot of resources executed a very sophisticated attack under the noses of the bitcoin community - it makes no sense to suddenly stop; it literally screams "hey, yeah we attacked ya'll!"

Not to mention that people are comparing a company that has had 166 years to mature. Yes, that's right - Western Union Co is a 166 year old company. Bitcoin on the other hand is 8 years old - it's crazy to think that an 8 year old idea/technology can accomplish 40% of what a 166 year old company has done.  
  
  
I well and truly believe that Bitcoin, in terms of transaction volume will reach Western Union levels within as little as a decade.

Holy shit. It all makes sense now...

Localbitcoins? Sure, it's a bit slow with each vendor wanting to verify your identity but it's fair rates and lots of payments options..

Not buying it.  
  
  
Why is it so that at seemingly random times the mempool appears to fill artificially - increasing unconfirmed transactions and pumping fees in the process? and is it just a coincidence the market goes into complete volitile mode when these events occur; the price thus skyrocketing.  
  
  
Illicit transactions have always been a growing part of the bitcoin network, for obvious reasons. There's no evidence to suggest that these markets and their tumbling mechanisms are causing clogs in the network; because if they were, it would be a continual issue and not something that fluctuates so much. For example, right now there's only 25k unconfirmed transactions. Additionally, the operators of these markets are highly skilled in operational security - mixing transactions in the way you suggest does nothing to anonymise said transactions and only increases the market operators workload (via additional support for tickets, etc).  
  
  
I've added your theory to my list of things to do. I'll likely need to analyse darknet market transaction load with the blockchain and see if I can heuristically pick up any patterns. 
  
  
I think some people want SEGWIT really badly. So badly they're willing to attack the bitcoin network by attempting to clog it with sophisiticated attacks; advanced social media misdirection - the whole nine yards.

Might want to look into Litecoin. It has a transaction capacity of 56 transactions per second; compared with Bitcoin's 7 per second. The block generation time is also 2.5 minutes, compared with Bitcoin's 10 minutes. Litecoin also has segwit activated.

It's a bit condecending considering he quite literally ordered hitmen, lol.

I've just taken a look at your account, it appears your first born didn't have 3 confirmations.
