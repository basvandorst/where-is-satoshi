I preferred the big dips. Kept it more interesting. ‘How much can I buy with my dip fund?’ - less nowadays... &gt;: /

This is the best advice you will receive. A lot of people here have tried it and lost, I am one of them. I’m not a professional full time trader, what was I thinking. By holding through thick and thin I have turned back into a decent profit. When I hit my target I will sell. Until then, hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:56:32
The concept of security, financial or otherwise, can be afforded value. Users of bitcoin often believe it provides them security and freedom, they are willing to pay for that.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:54:48
Very droll

The Great Cannon of China is an attack tool that is used to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks on websites by intercepting massive amounts of web traffic and redirecting them to targeted websites.[1] According to the researchers at the Citizen Lab, the International Computer Science Institute, and Princeton University's Center for Information Technology Policy, who coined the term, the Great Cannon hijacks foreign web traffic intended for Chinese websites and re-purposes them to flood targeted web servers with enormous amounts of traffic in an attempt to disrupt their operations. While it is co-located with the Great Firewall, the Great Cannon is "a separate offensive system, with different capabilities and design."[2]
Besides launching denial-of-service attacks, the tool is also capable of monitoring web traffic[3] and distributing malware in targeted attacks in ways that are similar to the Quantum Insert system used by the U.S. National Security Agency.[4]
The first known targets of the Great Cannon (in late March 2015) were websites hosting censorship-evading tools, including GitHub, a web-based code hosting service, and GreatFire, a service monitoring blocked websites in China.[5]

You’re intrinsic value argument is ignoratio elenchi.

How could this work?? It just proves there’s a serious attack going on. Weird.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:56:03
The maths is strong with this one.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:36:47

I wonder if they invest their pay in btc?!
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:51:54
The dips help us lose the weak. The strong, who hodl, are more robust to the next scare. As such bitcoin becomes more antifragile. Like the lion hunting the weak and frail wilderbeast in the savannah, the herd becomes stronger.

What is this shot you are chatting? ‘Keeping it above 7000’. That’s called buying. I absolutely love the free market. It’s eats people like you up.

What is the play here? I understand, and believe, that nation states can't prevent Bitcoin from existing or its ecosystem growing; but they can make it more difficult. Is that what China is doing here as this article describes? -Or, is this a move to remove the flotsam and jetsam in the crypto economy which is preventing an (in their opinion) state-run efficient bitcoin operation which can increase China's global influence through greater control over the inevitable Bitcoin/blockchain financial revolution?
The answers may affect my short-term investment decisions. Need a FUD filter!!!
Thanks. Been a hodler for a significant amount of time.
