Agreed, It doesnt need to. But the more successful it becomes the more financial operators will implement it in things like bakkt or etfs

Please explain how this is bearish.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:09:07
1. Hardware wallet
2. If u are planning on making further investment - DCA strategy imho
3. Try your best not to look at price from day to day.. it is seriously addictive. Especially if u start investing in alts.

Why would they dump? Wouldnt they just Keep it and use IPO money to push bcash like a mf.. I think despite this recent news they will still be able to raise quite a few $$$?
Im not a bcash fan by ANY means but I think people are underestemating what mr WU is capable of.

I once sold my entire bitcoin stack.. at approx 5.6k. 
I felt horrible and physically ill (no joke). I bought back almost immediately (within 24hrs). 
I now know I am a hodler of last resort. Red candles are for celebration and cakes.
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:14:43
Yep. Not only btc. IF foundation get paid in IOTA instance.

Only in regards to being very heavy energy demanding which is bad..
Funny to see how his words are twisted as bullish in regards to btc. Sure it is a Good thing he recognize the cryptospace as a potential replacement for Fiat, but he never mentioned btc in that regard. That said, I think btc is the most likely candidate to do it..

We were at ath both price- and hype-wise. The market was flooded with 14yr old daytraders buying at ath.. the sickening and poison from these buyers will haunt the forums for a long time imo.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:09:33
 people are quitting and yelling shit like I have never seen before. The drop has made many retail investors scared enough to never enter again. 
The space has been waiting for institutional investors to save the cryptospace from crashing.. what a joke. They wont be saving anything. If they are to enter they will start by buying the ashes from this fire.. and I think there will be years before this fire turns to ashes..

In december I was of course happy about the ever growing value of my holdings.. at the same time I realised I might never reach my goal on having XX amount of btc.. i truly believe this slaughterhouse is a blessing and Im prepering for a long winter (possibly a year or two before reaching new aths) of accumulation. Cheers to everyone holding through these rough times!

And see where that is taking us.... this is a rare opertunity to for «little guy» to do what the wealthy are doing. Invest in deflationary assets

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:45
Exactly. They cant kill it but they can make it damn hard to use. When everything boils down people want simple solutions. Governments can make btc very NOT simple to use..  Thats why we need the govenrments embracements of some sort.. if btc ever is going to hit new aths.
Havent sold anything myself tho.. which makes me...? I dunno ��

 «Are we not all humans that all want to evolve and advance?»
Yes, but if it cost some institution its life the people behind it will fight even evolution and advancement for their own economic short term benefit. Thats how people roll
