Deflation is a problem for all debt that exists though.

Wars are also fought with armies, which Croatia and Serbia both have, and Liberland does not.

DAE le libertarianism = everyone is a millionaire?

I don't think there's any real question that bitcoin is in a massive bubble right now.

Yes, that's called hyperbole, and it's pretty common. Did you think that I literally meant "every single person living in Singapore is a millionaire?"

Ooooh, I can't wait to buy something for a wildly variable price!

I prefer not acting disingenuous when I knew exactly what someone what meant. I also give little importance to anyone who would take a statement beginning with "DAE le" literally. 
I also roll my eyes and think about what bullshit libertarianism is when people try to make claims like "Singapore being a highly economically free country (a claim even disputed by hardcore libertarian institutions) is the cause of Singapore having a high number of millionaires per capita."

Really? Person A says "Singapore the highest number of millionaires per capita." Person B (you) says "That's because Singapore is one of the most economically free countries in the world."
Economically free = "le libertarianism"
Highest number of millionaires per capita = "everyone is a millionaire."
Which part of that do you disagree with?

No, that's pretty much exactly what I was doing.


Considering the Heritage Foundation and the von Mises Institute don't even take the ranking of economic freedom seriously would be a good reason to write the idea off. Other good reasons to write off the idea: low taxes (millionaires move there to dodge social responsibility; supported by the fact that many of the millionaires are foreign), structure (the entire country is a single city, making it very dense and efficient), and high income inequality (higher than the US; also suggests that economic freedom is actually benefiting everyone).
