about 60% of the core community has left bitcointalk.org over the past year. about half of that 60% has left in the last 2 months. Bitcoin is a lot more than just that forums. Most of the veterans feel that the forum is more damaging that good. It use to be a wonderful repository of useful things. Now its all about who can make themselves appear to be on top. The trolling, the crazy mob's, the cliques of buddies who team up to plow through anyone they dont like. All thats really left on the forum is 95% kids, and grown men who act like kids, and 5% people who use it for basic communication and news. 
Most likely there will never be a "new forum" as promised. Take it from a guy who has been a web developer for over 12 years now. It does not take a million dollars to build a new forum platform, and it does not take a year to do it even if it were only 2 guys working on it. Further with a million dollars in donations. dont you think that the forum would have a mirror in the event something like this happened? I manage a dozen very expensive websites, every one of them has a mirror. Even if a server caught on fire and burned to the ground, it would take less than 1 hour for the DNS to propagate to the mirror. A mirror server costs less than $10,000 to build, and barley $100 a month in power. 
Most people forget, Theymos himself is still young, barley grown from a child himself. I think he's like 19, or maybe early 20's now. You cant expect a whole lot from the forum in that regard.
