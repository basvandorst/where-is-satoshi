I kindof get where your idea is coming from  but I do it for free in some smaller limited groups I'm a member of. I'll post "hey I'm in Nicaragua, will mail 5 bracelets to the first 5 that reply".  
  
Other than something like that....why bother? If you want to have people pay  5-10 and not know what they are getting, they'll either feel ripped off b/c they didn't think of shipping costs, or you'll have to send some really cheap shit.

Yes so every bank branch should have enough cash to cover every customers deposit amounts?  
I don't think having to notify the bank before you do a large withdrawal is the same as needing to ask permission - it's just a logistics issue and I'm sure it's in the paperwork when you open the account. If you don't want the restrictions of the bank account, then just use cash and a safe at home. You lose both the benefits of the bank, as well as any bad policies you don't agree with.

Yes instant for 1 BTC now not 10, and only if you have a visa (my bank only offers Mastercard).  
With the volatility of BTC how soon you can sell them does make a difference sometimes - but I think Coinbase and Bitstamp are not trying to be the same type of entity. Bitstamp is trying to be an exchange, so buying and selling is part of the business model whereas Coinbase is trying to be more in line with a merchants tool to help facilitate buying with BTC.  
   
I'm not complaning about Coinbase though - I just don't think they are the   


 
They are great for a specific use, but if you have access to a European bank and Bitstamp you are not missing out on a lot, and have other benefits.

Saying it's not useful is going too far, but it is a detriment for most people.  
But it's a detriment of many things, gold, stocks, whatever. These other things though have a much longer history you can look at.  
  
I'm a believer long term in bitcoin, but the detractors make some valid points. I doubt most people even in this sub are willing to put every dime they have into bitcoin. I know I haven't, even if I have put a not unsubstantial sum into it.  
  
So I'm not disagreeing with you, the major news outlets especially make a lot of mistakes and the pundits just show their ignorance with a lot of their statements. I just understand why they, and I as well, would not advise my grandparents to "invest" too much into it.  
If someone says it's too volatile though - ask them what the price of gold will be in a year. If they know beyond a shadow of a doubt what it will be, then they can make a fortune, however the point I am making is that even gold has price volatility. Just not as extreme as bitcoin.

There are many ways to get a plausible story - any cash business where you can pad the income will work.  
Have you been to central america? At every border there are money changers. You might think they make money by giving people a poor rate on the cash they are bringing in from the previous country, and this is true. But when they go to the banks it will be more money converted than they could have reasonably taken in at any time.   All you have to do is be the employer of these people and you have a legitimate business.  
With Bitcoins I don't know for a fact that any criminals are laundering money yet - but as in all currencies they will at some point. Bitcoin just makes it easier to get it across the borders with no questions.

Luckily I have a rule with anything new like this and had a hard limit on what I would spend in the first month before deciding to add more money to the system.

True, with BTC once you have the accounts setup the percentage will stay roughly the same whereas I just checked on WU and $50 would cost $5 to send, so here BTC would be the clear winner. I wonder what the size of the average remittance being sent via WU and whether it as at a size where BTC is competitive.

 I was comparing these things a few weeks ago and was surprised at how cheap WU is - the savings aren't as large as I thought. I think it's realistic to expect to pay 1-2% total on both ends once there is an exchange available in Honduras, which honestly is at best $8 so $12 cheaper than WU but up to $16 which is only a savings of $4.  That is assuming buying on coinbase and paying their 1% fee plus whatever fee the fictional Honduran exchange charges. 
  
I'm hoping that over this year businesses will launch which focus on the remittance market, and thus compete directly on price with WU etc.

I trade on bitstamp as well but sometimes want to take advantage of sudden price changes and do not have excess funds sitting in the exchange. 
  
Trading on a real exchange is better but there is a use case for being able to take advantage of price swings with coinbase. I made a nice profit last week buying in the low 500's and selling at over 6. If I had to wait for the money to transfer I would not have been able to do that and because I was travelling when the price went into the 400's I couldn't take advantage of that.
  
I think using a real exchange has been mentioned enough that the point is made - how about those of us who see the use of this idea discuss it further. 
  
I'll look into the api later and maybe there is a way to hack a solution together.

This is what you are missing. Plus when you deposit bitcoins in any exchange then buy/sale you are not selling a specific coin, all the transactions are on the exchanges ledgers. When you move your coins from the exchange they don't send back the exact same coin - you deposit ten, sale 5, then withdraw the other 5. What they send you is just whatever 5 coins they have available in the hot wallet.

I agree - this is what they will need to do. At issue though is that the prices for Airbnb in my experience are in currencies that are stable in comparison to bitcoins and I know someone will not read the fine print and we will posts on here about how Airbnb ripped them off because the bitcoins or cash returned were of a radically different value than what was paid. I've only had to cancel one reservation with Airbnb - and that was all in once currency so I'm not sure how they handle price differences b/c of conversions issues. 
In my opinion this will not be Airbnb's fault, but some people will complain.

They should - but I foresee issues.   
You pay in BTC but the owner wants cash, then you cancel the reservation within the allowed time frame. What do you get in return?  
Since as far as I know Airbnb acts as an escrow service and doesn't pay the owner until you stay, this is further complicated if the price of BTC to fiat has changed. And ofcourse it will change.  
  
I think Airbnb can get around this by putting into the terms that your BTC are converted to fiat immediately, and you get the same service in  return.  
  
It's easy if the owners accept Bitcoin and Airbnb accepts them for their fees as well - all Airbnb needs to do is hold until these time limits are passed. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:03:03
I agree completely - I probably should have prefaced the first comment that I think this is an extreme long term view. I'm thinking within 5 years BTC will become a competitor, but it will be on a country by country basis.

I use Coinbase via ACH and Bitstamp via SEPA and can get money in and out of Stamp more quickly. On Stamp it always arrives in 1-2 days when sending and takes 2-3 to receive it back. Coinbase is always 4-5 days for me. The only benefit from Coinbase has been that when I see a major drop I can initiate a buy without having to send money like in Stamp.

@_date: 2014-01-26 18:46:48
Ok I get from all your responses on here that you are going to argue in favor of Coinbase relentlessly - and I am not arguing against Coinbase. I am only trying to point out that other options have benefits and inconveniences as does Coinbase so which is better for each person will depend on what use they want out of it.  


Buying and selling is part of Coinbase's business model. Most Coinbase customers are not merchants -- how could 600000 customers be merchants.  
I should have explained this better - what I intended to convey is that Bitstamp is an exchange for trading, whereas Coinbase is set up more for people to buy BTC with then use, and not act as an exchange itself. Whether Coinbase would like to operate as an exchange and is hampered by regulations in the US or not is irrlevent b/c in the current form they are not. Also Coinbase makes it very easy for users/stores etc to add a pay/donate with Bitcoin button on the website. Features like this are more merchant-centric than the features offered on an exchange (api access to oderbooks, bots etc). Also realize I am not saying ony merchants can use these tools, only that they are more likely and have more uses for merchants. I've added a donate with Bitcoin button created thru Coinbase myself, and I am most definitely not a merchant of any sort.      
As to the other points - 
Yes you can sell instantly, but only the BTC you have in your account, not those you bought 10 minutes before unless you have instant buy ability and only bought 1.  


Exactly what I said - "if you have access to a European bank and Bitstamp you are *not missing out on a lot*, and have other benefits." Not missing out on a lot is not the same as saying you are not missing out on anything, there are some benefits to Coinbase and I have not said otherwise.

I did the math a couple of years ago on sending money via bitcoin/bank/western union, and this is absolutely correct about the article being too optimistic. The method that was cheapest was highly reliant on country of origin (I was comparing sending from Europe or US to Central America) and amount involved. From exchange fees, conversion fees and bank fees no method was always cheapest.   
With bitcoin articles like this seem to forget that you generally pay a fee when you buy, the receiver pays a fee when they withdraw to cash and the exchanges buy and sale price may differ.

Having worked for one of the big 4 for a few years (in IT though not in audit) I can say that most people don't have an accurate idea of what the auditors/accountants do. The company I work for, and from dealing with people in one of the others, automated everything possible - but there is a lot to the job that cannot be automated. I don't think BTC makes most of what cannot be automated any different - I would think for the most part it is just another asset on the ledger, same as cash or physical equipment.  
  
Ok - not exactly the same as either, but a lot of the same.

I haven't read the article - but have an example that is somewhat relevant to your question.  
 I one did an informal cost analysis of sending money to someone in various countries using bitcoin versus western union. The slight price difference and conversion percentages taken by the exchanges in different countries meant there were many cases where WU was almost as cheap, or cheaper in some cases. Whether this was the case was also very reliant on the specific amounts being sent, and from which country to which other country. This was 2 years ago - but an easy comparison right now would be sending various amounts of euros to Bitstamp, buying BTC, sending to Coinbase and withdrawing to a US bank comparing this cost to the WU cost for the same amounts. This example - BTC is probably cheaper than WU but for higher amounts it is probably more expene sive than a wire transfer.

I expect the big swing will come when some company starts driectly competing with western union and other wire transfer services that are currently used by expats and migrant workers to send money home. I just checked on Western Union and the cheapest option to send $500 to Nicaragua would be $8 or 1.6%. That doesn't take into account whether Western Union will charge the receiver a shitty exchange rate on the withdrawal in Nica. I think it will eventually need to be easy for someone to use BTC as the transfer method for lower fees. I don't know what coinbase charges percentage wise, but I know other trading platforms that do .4% and lower. Assuming you pay the .4% on each end then you are still at half of WU's prices.   
Right now BTC is popular b/c of the speculation, I hope/predict that it will eventually be popular because of the network behind it.

I agree but.....If enough bitcoin enthusiasts started doing it then amazi might take notice. It's not a 1 year plan but in 2or 5 years if Amazon integrated BTC then we will know we were right and BTC is the currency of the internet versus being something a small group of people use.
Anything more like this that increased the actual usage of BTC as a currency is a good thing.

When one currency crashes it has a network effect and pulls some others down, and others go up. btc to dollar is just the norm for conversion, as in most other currencies. But a dollar collapse doesn't necessarily effect the Euro to Czech Crown conversion rate.
Might be good though if the exchanges/charts started showing more than dollar convrsions - euro or the local currency for where the exchange is. BTC China already does this.

I found this earlier today - 
No idea how good it is, but it only takes one. India is a fascinating place though. It's one of those countries where people had no home phones b/c they were very expensive and controlled by one company then suddenly in the late nineties cell phones started growing in number until all of a sudden there were more cell phones than ever could have had land lines.
As long as there is a lack of government interference, which is debatable with India, they could quickly grow to be a large player in BTC.

I've never heard of your extension before, but if you add this feature I will buy everything I already buy thru amazon using it just to help push btc into being used as an actual currency.
If you don't do it I'm going to start investigating amazons giftcard api myself :)

Everything from $350 to around 1100.

Ah ok - in CZ it's not free either (ar atleast not with my bank), but its pretty cheap.

If you are in the UK then coinbase is not going to be a very good option. First they want to link to a bank account, as far as I can find this can only be done on US accounts. Maybe they take international transfers and I am missing it, but I don't think so. 
Look at the European exchanges - SEPA transfers are cheaper and quicker than intl money transfers. 
Coinbase also does not hold your money, so you can't fill your account with fiat and wait for a drop. I use coinbase in the US and Bitstamp in Europe, Bitstamp is much better for buying low b/c  they will hold the money and you can set limit orders. Coinbase has no limit order functionality, so you have to be awake and connected when the drop happens. This functionality is on MtGox as well and probably most of the other European exchanges.

I have BTC - I'm asking the OP how he would sale the Litecoins in exchange for BTC
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:43:54
BTC is still in its infancy so people are antsy about crashes, and many saw the sudden one month rise as being an unsustainable bubble anyway. This coupled with some badly reported news about what China did caused the sudden crash.
Thats just my opinion and I am not a financial analyst but I think it's probably a fair assessment. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:01:08
They didn't actually stay at the resort - it's pretty expensive. But when they go to SJS they go buy a day pass sometimes. 
For diving you might want to look into Utilla and Roatan in Honduras. Both are more expensive than Nica overall (Honduras isn't, just those two islands), but the diving is supposed to be spectacular. I can't dive, but the snorkeling was. 
But back on topic - I don't know of anyone accepting BTC there either. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:30:40
Does the UK not use SEPA transfers like the rest of Europe?

When I started setting up accounts the price was just under $300, bought .25 at that price as a test. By the time the other accounts I needed were set up the price was flying past $800 and I was flabbergasted. 
A coupkeof years ago I wanted to buy some just as a "this looks kindof neat" but the barriers to buying were a pain and I didn't bother.
My moral is - you get in when you get in, and don't think of the time between now and the confirmation as a hindrance - take it as time to learn more about what you are getting into.

Same thing I'm curious about, but not finding one.

I'm hoping for stability of the type other currencies have - Euro/Dollar etc. Sometimes there will be crashes of one but longterm a business will be able to rely on in dealings. Right now a business needs to cash out immediately to be safe, and cannot do contracts in BTC , but a business in the US can do a contract with a business in Europe and write the contract in either currency and know the value will be mostly the same at the end of the contract. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:51:29
I think it helps to because Gyft is very open about accepting BTC and if they then become one of the larger sellers of giftcards for say Amazon, it helps to push forward the day when Amazon will take BTC. As of this moment I can understand large retailers not wanting to directly take BTC - the user base still needs to grow and the idea needs more time to mature. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:11:58
Just wait until they approve you, then you see a drop and want to buy one quick and get the message that Coinbase has bought all they can that day and if you buy you will get the price of a week later. That's frustrating as hell and has happened to me 3 times in the past month.

You can do this yourself on any of the exchanges. Put in limit buys staggered to a ridiculous low level, then wait for it to raise and stagger your sales. Rinse and repeat. 
Don't you owe me 30% for telling you this?

My company has 200 servers, 45 employees and several thousand users. We can delete an account in minutes.  
I've worked for companies with 250k plus users and account deletion was never an issue there either.  
I think your only valid point is about the backups but backups of data should not affect the live access of the user account.

I've been trying to buy some LTC but having trouble getting listed on an exchange that sells them.
What's your asking price and how would you want this arranged?

I agree...mostly, but I think a time is coming when America's debt economy becomes unsustainable. I don't think the dollar will completely crash, but other countries are going to be,and have been already to some extent, moving there reserves to other currencies. I think a slow decline of the dollar is the more likely scenario than a sudden collapse. 
Remember when the euro came out - it started in the realm of .75 USD = 1 euro, now its reversed, 1 euro buys you somewhere around $1.30. 
In 2001 in Czech Republic is was around 40ck to the dollar, now it's 20. 
These changes though have many many factors behind them.

didn't facebook have some form of currency a while back where you could buy credits?
Didn't go very far and they apparently switched to standard gift cards. 
There is already bitcoin 2.0, 3.0 etc in litecoin and the other versions. Some of these do have benefits - faster confirmatons being the main one I hear about. 
"how do you plan against this event. if i am to move a significant sum of money how will i ensure it will hold its value if better bitcoin comes along?"
Same as in the stock market - diversify. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

There are plenty of countries that limit what banks can do - what investments they can deal with etc. Until the mid nineties US banks could not also be investment banks.
I see nothing wrong with controlling what risks banks can take as that keeps the countries currency stable - notice the crisis's of the last few years where traditional banks took very risky bets and then fell because of it.

People have been predicting the collapse of the dollar as a currency for atleast 20 years because of the debt load and the USD has passed several "unsustaninable" amounts of debt. Yet it's still there, and still the currency where I can walk into more stores outside of its borders and use it. 
I'm not disagreeing with you that the USD should collapse based on the current situation, but I don't think you can say it will happen anytime soon.

The only way I know is to use another exchange - which depending on where you are can have it's own difficulties. I'm lucky to have a bank account in Europe as well as the US so can use SEPA for bitstamp and ACH for coinbase. Are there any US exchanges which hold money like bitstamp to let you instantly buy/sale?
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:59:58
I agree - the speculative value now is in my opinion a double edged sword. The volatility is making it popular, but the volatility works against what I think will be the long term strength of bitcoin - the network allowing easy, cheap transfers bypassing banks and outfits such as western union.
