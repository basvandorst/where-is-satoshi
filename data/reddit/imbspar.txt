**Warning**: The above post is incorrect - do not follow this advice.
My *job* is (sometimes) to find ways around DEP. Look up return-oriented programming (ROP, ROP chains, ROP gadgets) for a fairly simple example. Your post is dangerously wrong, so *please* do your research before giving advice like this. This can be profitable enough that the hackers drop in an 0-day to steal coins. I don't mean to be rude, but your post is possibly dangerous.
But, thank you for warning about the executables.

According to automated scanning things, it looks like there aren't any immediate dangers:  and  and  
When you try to login to mtgox, a connection is initiated to 82.118.242.145 (whois:  This is a VPS ( most likely located in Bulgaria ( The VPS website advertises connection speed around 10 mbps outside of Europe, so that's a little strange that a Japanese company would use that... The VPS also accepts bitcoin, allowing anonymous purchase.
Curiously, the SSL cert is for the https is for  "a Japan-based corporation founded in 2009 by Mark Karpeles." They're focused on "web hosting, application development, and system management." So if you go to  you get redirected to  but with an invalid certificate. 
According to an nmap scan (yes, it's perfectly legal), there are a number of RTSP ( ports open, implying that it's likely either a Windows box or a router in front of a Windows computer. 
I don't really have time to actually reverse engineer the binary, but it looks to be benign. Or it might be a "time bomb," activating malicious functionality after a set period of time. It might, however, tunnel through some malicious VPS host in the hopes that someone from mtgox actually tries to log in using this tool. The presence of a valid certificate from one of Karpeles' websites (that isn't mtgox) is strange, given that it redirects to mtgox. This could mean that the sysadmin for 82.118.242.145 is not very smart, or something weird is going on... It's hard to draw any real conclusions, though. Make of this what you will

If you phrased this in a polite way, that would be a good discussion.

I'll have to look into it later, but what are the problems with current apps?
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:11:31
What exactly would that entail? It sounds like just a bug in the app, or is there something wrong more fundamentally?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:58:14
I'd love to do that, but I just don't know if the battery can handle that. I don't have much experience with server services on the phone though, so that may be possible. Those projects might be a little big for the amount of time I have to devote, but I'd join a project. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:40:05
That sounds useful. Could probably code something of a base app, then people could work together to implement different vendors.

It wouldn't be too hard to be as secure as Top Secret requires. For even more randomness, use the truecrypt-like method of moving the mouse randomly in order to seed the generator. Swipe around the screen, there are countless sensors.

So you just mean something like "notice there is a 15% above average in volume over the past 5 minutes" and "alert, high volume and 10% rise in price" and along those lines? (saying which exchange it's from)
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:25:19
Yep, I'd highly recommend those courses. I've only taken the first one, but they're great.
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:05:57
And if you're going to make any decisions based on patterns, do more research than just that page. (Following links on Investopedia is good)
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:16:17
I love the idea, but to be honest, that's a little above my crypto knowledge... But I would team up with a crypto person (and someone to help code the client) if people came forward.
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:16:12
Okay, awesome. That could provide a good base for the silk road app, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:29:14
I definitely agree. That's why the US DoD makes it so hard to certify proprietary crypto implementations.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:56:32
I am wary, which is specifically why I used the words such as "as much as possible" and "tell you about." But, if you're against modelling human behavior, that's an interesting opinion.

:) I'll PM you when I get started
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:31:23
Right, I'll make the source public well before the final app is published. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:36:40
If I can get a group of people, that'd be great. But I don't want to start a project that nobody else is interested in finishing - that's just wasted time.
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:22:18
There's already a tor app for Android, what would you be looking for in a silk road app? An easy interface to interact directly with silk road (such as eBay for android)?
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:58:09
Okay that's pretty cool, that works then. I won't have much time this weekend, but I'll look into it as much as I can. Since there are libraries and all that, it really shouldn't be all too much work. Looks like I might be able to do a number of these apps :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:40:01
No no, that was my copy-paste mistake from another source... Sorry
Edit: apparently he did make that same mistake in the article
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:19:18
That seems pretty straightforward. I only have a little crypto knowledge, but what I know should be adequate. I'll probably do this in addition to whatever is the most popular here
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:45:41
So, more functionality than what the app that notimethanks linked to?
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:08:42
Unfortunately it looks like there's not much interest in it... But I am a miner that likes to make as much as possible, so I've played around with trading. I don't know much about trading statistics and such though, would you or someone be able to say what would have to go on behind the scenes in order to get this info?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:24:04
Frankly, I agree 100% that my crypto knowledge is not good enough. (In my opinion) Any implementation needs to be thoroughly reviewed by countless people, regardless of individual skill. That's why I'm definitely releasing source code.
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:13:09
Regarding releasing the source code - I'd rather not release it until I at least have something that works. Then, I'll release a private alpha, then a public beta with source code. (Change my opinion if you feel differently)
Regarding partners - my biggest weakness is making an app pretty. I can make it functional and logical, but I have little skill with graphical art. I will be using eclipse, so it's easiest if you're familiar with that.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:43:23
Yep, it does feel good to make fun of things that supposedly "intelligent" people (day traders) do. It feels even better when that's the popular opinion. Chart patterns are a simple and fun way to start learning short-term trading. When you research the "why" behind the patterns, that's when you can predict stuff.
I get it, the tea leaves reference is a troll. But most people here are just getting into trading, and now they see that people stand behind the idea that technicals are hogwash, and that fuels ignorance.
Technicals are part of a bigger picture of the current marketplace, and chart patterns are the prettiest manifestation of that picture.
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:34:16
Like a cryptocurrency stock ticker?
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:22:57
Okay, great! I'll probably hit you up shortly, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:24:22
Late reply, but... Yeah, I have studied it more than investopedia, but that place is what got me started years ago - it's good for a beginner. The idea with technicals is that they do tell you about the psychology and thought process of the active traders.
For example, head and shoulders. You see it hit a peak and fall to a certain value. Then, it goes back up to a new peak, but then falls back down to the same support. It goes back up, but not quite as high as the previous peak and then just starts falling again. The pattern hasn't finished yet, but it is even logical that the traders would be less inclined to buy after not succeeding in bringing the price up. Now the prediction: price will continue to fall if it doesn't rebound from its previous support. 
Now there are those triangles... Oscillating between two narrowing trend lines. That tells you that traders aren't sure where it'll go, so buyers are willing to pay more, and sellers are willing to sell for less. Then, the price breaks out of the triangle, and if it's above the resistance, sellers pull back (since they won) and buyers have to pay more. 
Technicals aren't just for computers, they're to formalize (as much as possible) the current relationship among traders. I'm personally not doing any short term trading in bitcoin. But some people are, and many, many more will in the future. Short term (a few months) is controlled by technicals traders. So while watching that live chart, know that what you see is 90% technicals. And while you watch it, you might even feel the struggle between the bulls and the bears.

Not to reveal my beliefs in any direction, I do think that could be a pretty powerful app. It's a little risky, but maybe I'll work on it as a side-side project :P 
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:34:21
It's not the chart that matters - it's the data behind the chart. The charts are just a visual representation of data. The patterns themselves are pieces of the puzzle. It's the support vs resistance, confidence, momentum... Those papers you linked to argue that charts alone don't work, and then draw the conclusion that charts are useless. That's an overgeneralization (a logical fallacy). Even investopedia highly suggests taking volume into account, linking to resources on other technical indicators. Chart patterns indicate the possibility and aid in making useful predictions.

Problem is, the appearance of security has no real correlation with actual security. I can have all those mechanisms but still store everything in the clear. To be honest, I don't think I can do better than anything basic with the timeframe I'm working with. I'd love to work with someone on it, but that's a little too much to do alone.
