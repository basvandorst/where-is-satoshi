I came here to say this. I feel like things will get VERY interesting once it starts moving, no matter the direction. Over a month going sideways with LARGE spike...? Gives me butterflies

The quick flash of the cash made me howl

Alright guys i'll take care of him. The only thing I can think of would have to involve some sort of AR game where electricity is generated through bouncing/motion blah blah blah and it would be connected to a mining rig. Super slow but so is your question.

When the bulls come will rappers start rapping about btc instead of cash

My alcoholic neighbor lost all his coins on a gambling site and now he spends his drunken time coding a replica site to get other people's coins.

Shoutout to the hodlers who stuck through the crypto winter of late Nov 2018 to late March 2019. Anybody else think we experiencing a similar sideways pattern?

Ah, I wrote it off because I lurk this sub and see people constantly complaining about how an error occurs every time they try to set Cash App up.

This subreddit wouldn't have 1 million subs if we didn't think it was going somewhere.

I mean you can basically equate it to the $2000 drop from 10k. I still check it a lot, kind of a noob so I don't say much

I believe that bankers are attacking the price in order to further strengthen their own "crypto" endeavors.

You do not actually own Bitcoin on Robinhood and Cash App. You give them money to buy BTC for you. I see you a trying to make a quick buck. Download Gemini (ios app with lowest transfer fees: 0.025%) and then download Authy. It is a 2 Factor Authentication app that connects your mobile number to your gemini account.
However, remember, if you are not given keys then it is not your BTC. Download Trezor or Ledger wallet when you want to actually own BTC.

In US, there is usually just a $5 minimum for using card. I assumed this covered the cost. Interesting post, really has me thinking.

This is amazing. Maybe slow it down a bit though lol
