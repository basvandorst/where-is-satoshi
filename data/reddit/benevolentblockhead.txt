I’d like to know, as well.  Why?  For the thrill of getting rekt at 100x, why else?

This Jim Cramer?  Seems like a swell fellow.

Apparently, when you get your appliances repaired you can pay in BTC (and the repairperson arrives in a tricked out F-150).
@_date: 2018-10-03 02:18:56
Haha, I see what you did there.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:44:32
OK, point taken. Thank you for your super logic.

In order for BTC to get from $3500 to $1,000,000, it would need to (roughly) 285x
BTC in March of 2010 was worth $0.003. To get to $3500 it had to more than 1,000,000x
Which is crazier?

So back in May, Bitcoin was "trading under $5,000 compared to the $20,000 it was trading at just five months prior"?  Damn, forgot to buy that dip! LOL

Exactly!  I was going to say "Bullish on BTC, bearish on humanity" LOL

Because why, "redditor for a day"?
