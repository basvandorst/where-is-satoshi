Still, he knows market psychology. And if we're ho eat here for a moment, that's what crypto is currently all about.

Tell her you got like 20btc or so and store the other ones on a separate wallet. She will have the same reaction as with 200btc. Judge from the her reaction if you wanna tell her about the rest of them.

Taiwan is working closely with IOTA to advance smart cities. Taiwan is most certainly bullish on crypto.

Merchants have an instant "guarantee" that they receive the payment. Sure they get it only a few days later, but they know after a few sec that the money is on its way. Neither credit cards nor bitcoin are ideal atm.

We need the pos sentiment of the average joes who swarmed in during the last bull run in dec. They bring new money. The masses of the small man raise us to new ath. And these guys are scared as hell now after the bubble bursted. It will take a long time until they feel safe again to give it another try. We are in bear mode now and will be for a while. Delete blockfolio and focus on other stuff. Eventually we will be back.

Bitcoin is an educated gamble at best. 
One we are all willing to take because of fomo and greed.

Would be price manipulation of it's finest.
Sell loads of btc, crash the market and have a befriended whale buy it at a discount and get a share as commission.

Didn't know fiat is rebranding. Do you think that'll help them moon?

Tax free after a year. Before that, 'first bought- first sold' applies. Means the first ether you sold will be taxed based on the first ether you bought.

Good news to have a minister for digitalization.
Bad news to have someone incompetent like her holding the position.
In Germany positions aren't filled with the most competent people, but the ones with the best connections.
Dorothee Bär has no affiliation or expertise in digital manners. She won't push any progressive laws and just tries to maintain status quo (because this is how you avoid fucking things up as a politician).

Haha, true! I expected OP to be German because of HIPP, but yes, Underberg definetly confirms it.

In a nice cheap Asian country you'll be good to go with $1k. So congrats on being a bit closer to your moon already!

It's called market economics my friend. Supply and demand determine the value of anything.

Investors buying in such high volumes don't trade on exchanges but get them p2p via brokers. It won't affect the price.

How can bitcoin ever become a currency if it takes 12min to pay for my coffee in the store? We still have a long way ahead of us.

They have offices in Berlin and Amsterdam afaik.

I second this. Our digitalization 'strategy' is a joke. Not long ago our chancellor Merkel called the internet "Neuland (new/unknown/unexplored territory) for all of us."
We're beyond saving.

If the majority of households has fiber by 2030 I'd be astonishingly surprised.
