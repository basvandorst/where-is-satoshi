I sold all my BTC for TUSD when it started to fall and bought back in at 6450 and gained 12%-15% satoshis. Learn to use drops like these to your advantage instead of coming up with conspiracies to blame some other thing than yourself.

I agree. The people pushing for an ETF clearly breathe through their mouths.  They are heavily involved in crypto but can't comprehend its purpose, which doesn't involve an ETF or any sort of regulation. Hence why it was created in the first place.

Approx 22 Million Bitcoin Wallets total in existence atm
Ignore exchange wallets because technically that is owned by 100s of thousands people. But if u look to page 8 u can see how little compared to page 1 they have. Also, look @ number of outs.
Bìtmain isnt having absolute financial difficulty but whenever an industry loses 50% of its market cap over the course of 2 months the monopolies (in this case monopoly) feels it the most. Recently they disclosed they will be more transparent in the future is an indication people are wising up to what bitmain is actually doing to crypto. The truth is it isnt completely their fault, it is the sheep that are pro asic fault.

Rekt.  fuck you bitmain.  FUCK YOU. hahahah. Hope your useless shit technology that made you what you are ruins you. I hope all the money you invest into AI bankrupts you. That is what you get for hoarding your coins and releasing newest asic miners privately to friends and family months before public release.
Thank fuck the retarded community is finally understanding what asic miners and hoarding does. 96% of btc is possessed by 4% of wallets and guess what, they dont ever send btc, they hoard.  One of the wallets sent 0.001 BTC last year.  And nothing is worse than holding, You need liquidity.
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:12:46
This. If anything monero will eventually be worth more than btc and btc will be an "alt coin"
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:54:23
So my initial impression (without doing any research and going off intuition) that bcash is just a cleverly duped coin, and not the result of a major part of the btc community wanting for that to happen, was correct?
I dont understand why there is a community that supports Bcash and says this subreddit is censored etc.   Is Roger Ver literally creating thousands of accounts and attempting to create the illusion that bcash is more popular and widely accepted then it actually is?
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:17:45
Nice sarcasm. But you obviously dont understand how this works. Bitmain is it's own worst enemy. If you dont realize what asic does to a coin then you need to do research.  Why do you think the superior coin monero is anti-asic?
Also 4% of wallets own 96% of bitcoin.  Some of those wallets refuse to ever actually spend any of the BTC.  Bitcoin is just as corrupt (if not more) than fiat.  Also, it isnt anonymous lol.
A lot of the sheep that push bitcoin dont even grasp the concept at all.

If you learn to daytrade you learn to see btc as gold and the altcoins as liquid.  You day trade altcoins and trade back to btc at the end of the day.  You ignore fiat conversion and only realize the btc gains.
Then time it takes to come "back up" becomes irrelevant.

Canada. Currently, only 50% of realized capital gains are taxable in Canada at an individual's tax rate. Some exceptions apply, such as selling one's primary residence which may be exempt from taxation. Capital gains made by investments in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) are not taxed.
Also... if you make a shit load on an exchange... send it to a cold storage wallet and only withdrawal small amounts at a time.  Dude should have traded btc to usdt and waited for it to plummit then went back to btc.... problem solved.
Whenever i finish trading for the day and i think btc will fall.... i trade to usdt and wait for btc to bottom out and then buy btc back
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:54:30
USDT is on Binance exchange and doesn't cost anything to switch to USDT other than 0.05% trade fee.  You don't have to pay any network fees to move your btc to another wallet or withdrawl fees. You can do it immediately.  Whereas, if you were to switch to fiat currency you are likely to lose money along the way and it will take a while.
if you trade on binance you can trade a lot of cryptos to USDT and hold.  it generally stays on par with USD.  it is at 0.99364 atm.
If you have, for example, $100 worth of BTC and you think it will fall a lot, you trade to USDT. It then may be worth $99.346 at worst.  You can see the 6month trend. It is a safe crypto.  You then rebuy back in when you think BTC has hit the bottom and you gain a shit ton of satoshi.
These are just numbers.  But for example.
you have 0.00100000 and it is worth $100 at that moment.  You trade to USDT and it fluctuates between $99.34 - $100.   
The original 0.00100000 was worth $100, but now it starts to lose value.  So 0.001300000 is the new $100 at it's original value.  You use $99.34 and get maybe 0.0012750000.
you just gained 0.000275000  :)
Look at BTC as GOLD. The alt coins as liquidity. And USDT as USD while trading.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:45:50
This is why you trade from BTC to USDT when BTC is high and then trade back from USDT to BTC at these prices and make a shit ton of money on the way back up :)
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:52:15
You guys do know the CEO of twitter double downed his original investment into btc when it was at 7800 the other week.  
Use your heads.   This is part of the market manipulation to drive prices further down to re-invest.
I am happy they are getting rid of crypto ads.  These ICOs and the people that invest real money into a coin based on a "whitepaper" (a high functioning autistic 6 year old could  have made) is ridiculous and getting out of hand.
It is crappy some of you got caught in the crossfire.  Now take it as a sign to devote your energy elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:47:57

As long as asic miners exist and bitmain continues to monopolize btc, the down trend will continue. You wont get outsiders in if it is a monopoly. Ironically, bitmain may become it's own worst enemy as it continues to defeat btcs purpose

Wall street continues to bet on futures lower than price atm.  Whales that are betting on that future price are the ones dumping to make their futures pay off.
They broke 7800 bot wall.
7500 twitter ceo and McAfee auto buy preventing it from further manipulation downwards.
How long this will last.. nobody knows.  I think if it can hold at 7500 until tomorrow we will see it raise to 9200 and then be retested at 8250.
Otherwise. 6200 new bottom

I for one stopped using fiat to buy BTC because I won't support centralization.  Also, the higher the value of btc, the more money bitmain makes from mining.  So who is to say someone else with a lot more money wouldn't feel the same?
The more money people put into crypto, the more bitmain makes from mining.  It is simple math.  Why would anyone buy btc with fiat money? At this point it isn't even anonymous and bitmain is defeating the purpose of BTC.
Monero is far superior on many levels.  As time goes on the community will come to realize this.  Hopefully during this realization not everything becomes pegged to btc which is pegged to fiat.     I suspect 5 years from now monero will be top 3 and ethereum could potentially be  as they are in the process of getting rid of mining completely.  And we will see btc fall down to $2000 as monero and ethereum reach that mark too. Then the 3 will rise and fall independently from one another

Careful using "block chain" as it is a target for hackers due to the nature of how one logs in.  Also blockchain has 2 out 3 keys.... mycelium the user has 2 out of 3 private keys.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:25:44
Stay away from coinbase, 4 or 5 years ago people were saying they work closely with governments and they give users private info to them. Fast forward to now and ya, they do.
Blockchain.com if you are looking for ease. But again be wary as they may do the same thing coinbase did. You also "log in" so hackers target blockchain.com
Mycelium is most secure software option.  Enjin wallet is another option but less secure than mycelium.

Unless you're using hardware. If he wants it stored on a QR code or piece of paper then yeah... you have to in order to generate the private keys.

Person puts $10 billion into crypto. BtC goes up to $7200. Bitmain now profits 6x3x24x700 more a day.
Since they have 50% of mining and each block pays 12 on avg every 20 minutes that is 6x3.  24 is how many hours in 1 day.  700 is the hypothetical increase due to $10billion added to industry.  So... $320,000 a day extra.. times 365... $100million a year.

Use mycelium as your wallet (most secure software wallet imho). You can also integrate trezor with mycelium which makes it impossible to get hacked or for someone to gain access to your wallet.
Don't worry about coldstorage yet. You have to synchronize with the blockchain to do that. That takes weeks.
Once you accumulate a large sum in mycelium wallet then transfer to cold storage.   Warning...Cold storage has nothing to do with "crypto lux". Crypto lux is a scam platform using that term wrong to confuse newbies. They made their own coin called "cold storage". this is scam I'm talking about  they use cold storage to confuse newbs
When a person wants to pay in btc they send to your receiving address which will automatically change every time a transaction is received. You can continue to use the old address or new one, they will all go to the same wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:07:43
Or just use mycelium and trezor
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:36:28
I'm not saying you can't go cold storage without syncing to blockchain. The point is If you don't sync and dont do it yourself you hAVE to rely on a 3rd party. Same with hardware methods.
To go cold storage (paper wallet) without the use of a 3rd party requires syncing to blockchain.
