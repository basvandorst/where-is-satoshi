That BitPay hack was 100% pure unadulterated negligence on the part of BitPay. Sure, insurance companies will look for any way to exempt themsleves from liability but this is hotwallet and precisely why BitGo gets the big bucks for their services.

Transparency is key to any proposal that does not include a third party governing. I would not agree to any arrangement without a seat at the table. Its would be best if all creditors (clients) engage, at the expense of Bitfinex, a trusted 3rd party. PWC (Price Waterhouse Coopers) has some very strong connections is the crypto space. Further, there needs to be an additional financial contribution from the company and from the principles that represents interest and penalties on the lost funds. Mismanagement and neglect cannot be rewarded with further financial support. 
EDIT: Suggesting hiring PWC as a consultant, not a bankruptcy trustee. Have them assess and propose suitable "going-forward" steps.

"I feel guilty even thinking about asking viewers for donations. hmmm"
Therein lies the problem. You have no confidence in yourself and that is likely apparent. These are not donations you are asking for, these are rewards for providing content. 
So now you have nothing to lose. Post a message to your subs explaining that you will offer your vids on a subscription basis starting at 25 cents/mo- prepaid min 6 months - If you dont reach a respectable number of paid subs, cancel after the last 6 mo paid cycle ends. 
You could start with 12 months subscription for the price of 6 months if you feel confident enough.

I bet that min 6k you're spending (or contemplating spending) on legal might be better spent finding a group of similiar victims. If your case is unique, there will be others and you may have a chance at 100% recovery but you will need more than 12k to support that. You wont get any statements of substance from a potential defendants.  Further, cool down dude... you may get some help here.
Good luck.

Well not really a class. You claim your situation is unique. Are there others with the same situation?  10 other people in a similiar situation to shoulder a $50,000 legal bill (because if it has legs it would be that). Start with getting all the documentation starting from the source, your bank - SWIFT - ACH, everything that could bolster your case.  Dont share this publicly. 
BTW by virtue of similiar circumstances, you will become a member of any Class Action against BFX automatically. But would have to   
opt out to go your own way.

The compliance word overshadows the decentralized word at every turn when it comes to exchanges. Unfortunately bitcoin is center stage for financial crimes oversight and regular movement of btc to fiat is a bell ringer. But that does not mean you have done anything wrong. It just means that your behavior mimics those that do do things wrong.  Let the dust settle and only lawyer up if it was an error on Kraken's part. Be warned that any legal beagle is gonna suck the life out of you even if they see no opportunity. It is very very unlikely Kraken is doing this without reasonable cause/legal direction. Kraken has a host of AML/KYC &amp; Privacy rules to follow and failure to adhere to any of them puts way more than 40k euros at risk, way way more. Last I heard Kraken had a valuation of $100 Million+  they dont need $50 or 60k USD.  Good luck.

Coinbase or BitPay to get started. Remember that you can have a "local" wallet on your mobile or desktop where you store your own bitcoin (keeping the private keys in your custody).

My understanding is that the difference between what you "acquired" the bitcoin for and the "sale" of that acquisition is taxable.
For example and Ill use easy numbers (bitcoin price is $100.00):
Scenario 1. Say you "acquired" a single bitcoin for $100.00 and immediately purchased a $100.00 bicycle using bitcoin, there is no tax event. 
Scenario 2. Say you "acquired" a single bitcoin for $100.00 and after one week the price of bitcoin went up to $120.00 each. Now you went out and bought a new leather jacket for $120.00 in bitcoin.  There is a $20.00 gain and now you have a tax event. That $20 gain, regardless of the fact it was part of a bitcoin transaction, is still taxable. 
Please correct me if Im wrong.

Setup accounts on a reputable exchange like Coinbase and get verified to the highest level. Expect your financial institution to have a question or two as they will look deeply into the inflow of mega dollars to your bank account.

**Canadian police used BlackBerry's key to unlock BBM messages**
*New report claims over 1 million messages were decrypted over two years*
"The only people immune to that sort of potential snooping were those with BlackBerrys connected to an enterprise server. Corporate BlackBerry servers generate their own encryption keys, but devices that don't use those servers -- that is, all personal BlackBerrys -- rely on an identical peer-to-peer encryption key loaded onto the phone when built. Somewhere along the way, the RCMP obtained that key and used it to unlock BBM messages in transit. And as you might have guessed, the juiciest questions this report raises don't have satisfying answers.
How did the RCMP obtain that global key? No one is sure, though court documents obtained by Vice and Motherboard suggest BlackBerry has a some sort of working relationship with Canada's federal police, at least when it came to intercepting BBM messages. In light of the FBI's recent privacy dust-up with Apple, it's possible the RCMP somehow obtained it with the help of a third party."

I would start with a payment processor merchant account with Bitpay or Coinbase. They make it very easy.
It's very important to understand that you can easily accept Bitcoin without using an intermediary payment processor.
After you get comfortable with the many ins/outs of bitcoin it's no problem to change from payment processors to self hosted.
It is a great idea to encourage consumers to pay with Bitcoin. Remember to frame a return/refund policy that outlines the currency you will refund in. The volatility of Bitcoin creates big problems for merchants if policies are not clear.
Good luck and keep us posted

The BF needs to revisit their game plan. We presented some ideas to the BF back in Dec 2014.
Here is recap of a few with additional items.
Foundation says its all about CORE - seems to not be working too well. 
MORE FOCUS ON MERCHANTS + RUN IT LIKE A BIZ
*1. Offer free memberships (initially) to Merchants with easy sign up. Once established this will be easy to set annual fees. Offer (free and paid) marketing campaigns through BitPay, Coinbase and other industry members.
*2. Have a completely separate portal built to accommodate **merchants** and only **merchants**.  Dont group merchants with noobs and kids wanting to learn about Bitcoin. Dont group merchants with radical you-tubers or those wearing stupid looking outfits and the fuck-this / fuck-that anti-establishment diatribes. Show merchants that Bitcoin is big business, show mechants that Bitcoin has adult participation and the Bitcoin Foundation takes Bitcoin seriously. Show merchants that inclusion in the Bitcoin community is valuable and the Bitcoin Foundation will make certain they have the support they need.
*3. On the new merchant web portal provide an interactive assessment/evaluation of the merchant from zero knowledge to advanced and let them start at any level they feel comfortable.  Have specific videos, done/sanctioned by the BF, discussing things like cold wallets, hot wallets, local bitcoins, buying, selling, trading, security, multisig, 2FA, etc. Everything they need is there.  And have a FAQ specific to Merchants needs.
*4 Have quarterly video conferences with merchants and key BF members and executive to update on consumer sentiment and community events.
*5. Incentivize downstream vendors of Member Merchants to become involved in Bitcoin.   
*6. Abolish the lifetime membership fee - that is a poor business model.  Add a maintenance fee to grandfathered memberships and give them a cool Tshirt printed by a company that accepts bitcoin and designed by a bitcoin accepting artist. Have a contest for design which creates buzz.  Put advertising of Merchants and industry members on Tshirts. Give one - newly designed Tshirt, showing the year-  every year to every member and merchant/industry member. People want something tangible for their dues. Tshirts are cool..  Let them give the tshirt away to a friend or neighbor if they have too many, THAT creates awareness.
*7. Increase annual membership fees for individuals to $100.00/ and give them a Tshirt evey year.
*8. Run the BF like a business.
*9. Hire webmaster that knows how to put member logo images on a website.

Coinbase has a job to do.  They are obliged, as part of AML/KYC to ask questions. No government body can say they didnt do their job and they dont care how you **answer the questions**
Describe the primary use for your Coinbase account- **Buying Bitcoin**
Describe the source of your incoming bitcoin transfers- **Other Bitcoin Accounts** 
Indicate the source of income for your purchases of bitcoin- **My Employer &amp; My Job**   
What’s the nature of your outgoing bitcoin transfers and what service(s) are they are related to? - **Pure recreational spending and pure fun**

Not to you, but to the bitcoin community and ecosystem its up there. 
Dont underestimate the influence Canada has on world sentiment.
Canada is recognized around the world as a leader in financial governance. In 2009 Barack Obama noted to the CBC, "In the midst of the enormous economic crisis, I think Canada has shown itself to be a pretty good manager of the financial system and the economy in ways that we haven't always been," 
Mark Carney, a Canadian and former Governor of the Bank of Canada and head of the G20 Financial Stability Board, is now the Governor of the Bank of England.
Fintech in Canada is growing in leaps and bounds and this report only serves as a catalyst to woo the uninitiated.
Brace yourself.

Merchants pay a fee to CC payment processors. They have to build these fees into their pricing model. Merchants often offer discounts for cash but do not promote it. Merchants who accept bitcoin often discount prices because the fees are low and there is no risk of chargebacks.  Paying with CC is convenient and retail sales would not exist without the accessibility of consumer credit. Bitcoin is your cash. CC is the banks cash.

After his speech was over he took about four questions from the audience. One came from Steve MacPhail,  CEO of CI Financial. Steve asked Victor how he felt about Bitcoin and Victor responded very positively. It was a great event and, while it was not just about bitcoin and the blockchain,  Victor Dodig cast both in a very positive light.

You have no reason to believe Coinbase cannot be a trusted with your bitcoins. You should research more and understand that there are many storage options available.

Shut the discussion down.
I dont know if you have done anything wrong or if you are a scammer or if you are a recovering drug addict or if you have misappropriated Bitcoin or conned some donors.
I do know that you have a right to have this dealt with properly and, if you are sincere in your efforts to respond to these accusations, do it in a way that benefits everyone, including you and the people that rely on you.
Get an attorney and tell LTB that is how it will be dealt with. If LTB thinks a crime has been committed they have a responsibility to take it to the authorities and let them deal with this. LTB is being irresponsible playing "60minutes Investigates" . This is not about Bitcoin, these are very serious allegations and are being compounded by the posters.

Is the point here that the Merchant gets beat up with every convenience that is handed to consumers ? Which those Merchants ultimately pass on to consumers? Is it smart marketing for the Bitcoin merchants to pass on the savings by discounting for Bitcoin.
BTW this "apple pay" thang is really quite relative to Bitcoin right now... smart Bitcoin merchants can ride its coattails

These scams are rudimentary and are preventable. Regulation has everything to do with this. We dont want to be regulated by any other body but our own. We dont want to be burdened by unnecessary gov oversight. If an industry can manage and protect itself from everyday evils, it will thrive, if it cannot do those two simple things, and keep its constituents reasonably safe, it will fail or be taken over by stronger forces.  Regulation as in self-regulation.  Tell me, if Mt. Gox was required to do a regular "proof of solvency" would things be different today?

Sorry my friend.  You have facilitated a witch-hunt and anything past the tough questions of how Seans Outpost is being run is not your business.
Using your LTB platform and guest to present IRREFUTABLE FACTS (the operative here is "irrefutable") about the Seans Outpost is a great idea.
It's irresponsible of you to rationalize and support having your buddy Jason stand up and respond, in a public forum like Reddit, to the accusations of fraud, insurance fraud, misappropriation of funds and the like. 
Jason needs his friends to encourage him to seek help and guidance and, if he has violated any laws, own up to them. There is a right way to do this.
You have done your job. The light is shining on Jason King and Seans Outpost, thats all you need. Let the authorities take over.

Those widgets exist and yes, that seems like a parallel/ alternate means of tipping. But the enduser needs to install and setup these mediums of exchange, not gonna happen with people that dont know about or care about Bitcoin.
What I love about changetip is the ability to send Bitcoin via social media to anyone, regardless of whether they have used it or heard of it.  
The fact Bitcoin is waiting for them to cash in is an incentive to set up a wallet/account and learn about Bitcoin.
I do believe however that the 1% fee starting in Jan 2015 may be an obstacle to broad acceptance and an invitation to competition. I think they need to rethink and look at something sub .5% to ramp this up globally.
This could be a classic ChangeTip pumps up the tires and some small crowdfunded devs come in and ride the bike.

lol what? Are you speaking on behalf of the OP or LTB?  Im disturbed that LTB would allow this to evolve. Do you see anything that even resembles suggesting lawsuit in my post? I didnt think so.  
Let me summarize this. 
1. Jason is crazy to respond to anything in a public forum that may affect his liberty.
2.  Jason has a right to due process and needs an attorney to facilitate that.
3. The OP has achieved his goal of getting Jason to respond and now needs to step aside.
4. If the OP believes that a crime has been committed they need to follow the rules and file official complaints with the local police and make written complaints to the agencies responsible for charities. The OP also needs to get their facts together and have their evidence "irrefutable", and not be making phone calls and speaking with front-line call-center staff who may not know shit from sandwiches about what is going on.
5. I support leveraging social media to shine light on the underbelly, but this has gone too far.
6. Is this a story or an investigation? Because if its on "Lets Talk Bitcoin"  I would think its a story about Bitcoin. But its not a story about Bitcoin, its a criminal investigation supported by LTB and I dont feel that is right.
I look forward to this all being resolved to the benefit of the people at Seans Outpost and the Bitcoin Community.

Going up against uber would be no small task and building an app is the very last thing on your business plan. Im not sure if you realize that uber has a valuation in the $18 Billion range. Does it mean there is no room for competition? No, absolutely not, but it does mean that the competition needs to be funded, and well funded to go up against the likes of uber investors who plowed $billions into first round including Google Ventures and some very savvy Silicon Valley VC's .

For the volume to increase there needs to be greater Merchant adoption. People have no reason to buy Bitcoin if they no place to spend it or they cannot pay for or buy the things that they need or want.
Making Bitcoin more accessible to consumers is important but far less important than getting Business / Retailers to accept it as a form of payment. 
I see the rollout of ATM/BTMs helpful to the cause but not the answer.

Yes reading loads on loads of Bitcoin sites is what you need to do.  And, unfortunately, you need to keep reading loads on loads of Bitcoin sites until it stops confusing you greatly.

Amir Taaki is to be admired for his intelligence, skill and dedication. He is captivating and appeals to the "rebel" in all of us. 
Unfortunately those that work every day at bringing Bitcoin mainstream encounter resistance from Merchants &amp; Business people who don't want to align their Company Names, Brands or reputations with a product that is associated with the radical. People neednt be reminded of the stigma attached to Bitcoin re its popularity with the worlds underbelly. Its been challenging overcoming that stigma but the efforts are paying off.
Mr. Taaki needs to understand that his popularity may well be a result of the efforts of mainstream business / media that are bringing Bitcoin to the masses.
He and his ardent supporters should consider how much more expansive his audience would be if he works towards the greater good of Bitcoin and bringing about widespread adoption.
Everybody deserves to be a winner in the Bitcoin game. 
Good Luck Amir...

I completely disagree. We need endless pounding of the benefits of using Bitcoin and relentless marketing to Merchants expanding the capacity of Bitcoin users.  Not sure if you were around during the mid 90's - there was tremendous hype and marketing relating to this new electronic mail and dialup-internet access. Remember, the marketing reach of those new state-of-the-art companies was snailmail, word-of-mouth and telemarketing. Pale in comparison to the broad reach and speed of today when a press release is seen worldwide in minutes.

It is already an uphill battle getting consumers, merchants and the public at large to accept digital currencies. No doubt this discussion is important, but it may be better to have it when adoption is greater, regulation (whatever it may be) has taken hold and the BTC price has a solid floor.

You are on the right track,  but 5 points? As many have pointed out, that's no incentive at all.  We do need to incentivize Merchants and it is proving to be very challenging. 
Confidence, understanding, price stability, ease of use, ease of Forex conversion and ease of crypto integration into operations, coupled with giving Merchants access to new markets and otherwise unavailable opportunities is a nice incentive package - but can this be done without burdening the Merchant with excess Bitcoin fees and payment processor overhead which just takes us back to square one?

@_date: 2014-10-27 10:37:31
some interesting highlights from this article.
...Whenever Canadians pay for goods or services using a credit card, the merchant is charged a fee – typically between $1.50 and $3 for every $100 spent. In 2010, the federal Competition Bureau estimated these fees amounted to $5-billion annually – and credit-card use has grown in the years since. These fees are usually passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Throughout the yearlong negotiation process, the Finance Department has listened to suggestions from key players such as banks and small businesses, but has leaned on credit-card companies to lead the charge. Both Visa and MasterCard have argued there is no need for regulation – yet a resolution still hasn’t been reached.
SO..  Visa and MC argued no need for regulation? Of course not, "Please Dont Touch My Cash Cow"

I just returned from Inside Bitcoins New York..   Bitcoin is big business...
-From June 2014  Forbes -
BitGo’s patent-pending multi-signature e-wallet technology could be the solution for institutional investors’ bitcoin storage woes.  Investors looking to hold large positions in bitcoin have few options as to where to store them.  The typical bitcoin wallet is single key, meaning only one password is needed to access the funds.  However, these keys can be susceptible to theft via computer hack and loss if the user forgets their password.  Until recently there has not been a practical or easy to use solution to storing large amounts of bitcoin.
Bitcoin investor and actor, Ashton Kutcher says that security is of the utmost importance to encourage widespread adoption of bitcoin...
"Kutcher is also an investor in BitPay and personally started purchasing bitcoins about a year and a half ago.  He says BitGo’s multi-sig technology “is the best solution I have seen to date and the company has an incredible opportunity to own the security market for bitcoin.”

Well thought but unrealistic post.  I hope you get a second chance when you need it. 
Running a business is tough and these guys have no history of fraud or incompetence. 
This is a single incident of poor judgement that included some ill conceived efforts that are tantamount to fraud, but the intent was never fraud and it is always about intent. This is a perfect example of "unintended consequences"
Be very careful my friend because you are young and you are imperfect and your day will come and when it does you will ask for understanding.

Hi Francis,
For the benefit of anyone just seeing your announcement I bring forward my previous concerns.
Congratulations to Francis Pouliot and its great to see my fellow Canadians making bold statements on the future of the Bitcoin Foundation.
It is unfortunate that the vision Mr. Pouliot brings is too narrow in scope and will result in membership decline and likely a complete failure of the Bitcoin Foundation.
While Mr. Pouliot makes some very valid points about the weaknesses in the current structure, to completely dedicate all resources to "Technical development" making it "the Bitcoin Foundation’s only essential mission and main expenditure" is a recipe for disaster.
The Bitcoin Foundation needs to take a leadership role in the Bitcoin Community and not just focus on the technical side. I concur the technical side is important and deserves funding and competent and dedicated personnel.
The Bitcoin Foundation will flourish and membership will grow and more resources will be available with a plan that appeals to a broad audience, not just developers and core technical community members.
I find it troubling that Mr. Pouliot makes a key reason to vote for him that he has 85% of his assets in Bitcoin. That is a gambling man.
My Silver Membership dues should not be used for gambling.
Good luck.
Brett Russell
Note:  My reference to gambling is made to to illustrate an approach, not to suggest Mr. Pouliot takes Bitcoin Foundation membership funds and go to the casino. 
I would like to add that we need people like Francis in the Bitcoin space but his mandate is short on foresight.

OP is dead on! This is a real issue. The BTM owners are learning real fast -see CAVIRTEX  in Canada, that consumer sentiment is far more powerful than any self-serving ill-conceived cockamamie biz plan.
I say there is a great opportunity here for an APP that shows realtime exchange prices similar to AirBitz.
With ubiquity of Bitcoin, it not unrealistic to anticipate retail stores, coffee shops, etc...  may pay to have BTM's installed or rent them to drive traffic. Then we have a viable /profitable biz model.  However, the time is not right... yet.
This is what we are planning to do with Skyhook.

Nicely written but with no evidence that Bitstamp is liquid and has been upfront. 
Our friend has some solid advice for 
If the Bitcoin Foundation played a role in bringing together and working with all foundation Membership, Merchants, Exchanges, Payment Processors, VC's, Developers, public and private interests, etc. in setting up standards of conduct that would address these types of PR failures (among many other things) we may be in the know by now.
Using the Bitcoin Foundation to do more to bring confidence in Bitcoin to all members of the Bitcoin Community is a long overdue concept.  This should not be the sole responsibility of Industry titans who may have their own priority agenda.
I hope this resolves quickly to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

Hi Michael,
Thanks for stepping up with the AMA.
1. Can you provide some detail on your accomplishments at The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and a general overview of what the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada has done. 
2. You are active and a benefactor in for-profit companies selling training and certification services in the Bitcoin space and, if elected, have demonstrated a desire to work on standards and certification for the BF. Will you resign your positions with these companies or how would you avoid conflict-of-interest issues when it comes to BF policy and direction.

The author writes .. "But stability — and for many consumers, comprehension or relevance — remain elusive."...  and Ingrid is spot on. 
The majority of consumers have no incentive to start the arduous task of learning about all that is necessary to buy, hold and use Bitcoin. Consumers are interested in ONLY one thing and that is "consuming". If the Bitcoin space cannot attract Consumers, the task of attracting Merchants becomes monumental. 
BitPay should be commended for their excellent work and their continued effort developing the Merchant side of "comprehension and relevance" evidenced by the  recent Bitcoin Bowl. BitPay's efforts, and the efforts of the 100+ St. Petersburg Merchants that gave Bitcoin a chance, may be for naught and BitPay (and all payment processors) will ultimately fail if those Merchants see no return on that effort.

...and they continued : 
"Both Ficht and the tour company say they are through with PayPal.
"I will never use PayPal again until that has changed," said Ron Berezan, owner of the Urban Farmer in Powell River, B.C.
"To tell me this is unacceptable is an infringement on my own personal freedoms and the values of Canada, which of course vis-a-vis Cuba, are very different," Berezan said.
"It was a fairly easy conclusion on my part," Ficht said.
"I don't really need [PayPal] that badly that I have to be further involved in something that doesn't apply."

Great REVIEW and clearly you have brought any security deficiencies with the competing product to the forefront.

As you are clearly aware, manufacturing R&amp;D is a very expensive game and cost recovery is seldom seen for years.  Some Governments provide tax credits for companies heavy in R&amp;D.
Undoubtedly you have a winner and winners attract many people, including copycats and losers.

SL deserves the benefit of the doubt here. They clearly had no experience in how to deal with the competition and thought they were doing the right thing.

BitPay did an (almost) textbook marketing play with Bitcoin Bowl sponsorship.  Had the bottom not fallen out of bitcoin, they would have easily continued sponsorship for yrs 2/3 which would have made a world of difference to brand recognition.  Everything they did was right-on except they forgot the one place to focus marketing and bitcoin education.. THE BARS. I was there, I was giving away $5 in bitcoin for beer at Fergs via changetip. Nobody I met heard of bitcoin. They wanted the free beer but as soon as I said I was going to give them bitcoin, they said "WHAT?". I had been tweeting FREE BEER all day. The problem was the patrons were either too busy partying to engage anyone in any discussion (about what bitcoin was) unrelated to football. All the merchants in town were setup but unfortunately very little bitcoin made its way there. BitPay did an outstanding job overall...

Why are these pre-requisites for adoption?  Do you go into a Merchant who currently knows nothing about Bitcoin except what they hear from the Silk Road trial and say - We have updated the Bitcoin Core to version 1.1. Are you now interested in accepting Bitcoin?"
The Foundation, through its board and membership, is well connected and recognized worldwide. Exploit this. Capitalize on this. The Foundation can make Bitcoin relevant to a broad audience.
Dont expect BitPay or Coinbase or Bitstamp et al to do all the heavy lifting, they have their own agenda. 
Your goals are analogous to Bill Gates focusing on programming and code in the early days of MS and completely ignoring marketing/distribution.  MS would have not flourished if the scope was not broad.

Nothing would happen to your bitcoins. I am purely speculating that a takeover may happen but consolidation in fintech is inevitable and PayPal has the resources and the motives. I met and spoke with the CFO of PayPal at The Conference of State Bank Supervisors Emerging Payments Task Force - Chicago in 2014 and at that time they were pumped about bitcoin. Coinbase is slowly getting their feet wet in more than bitcoin. Diversification is what companies need to do to stay in the game.

Coinbase is doing a great job in the space but the Shift Card does nothing for bitcoin.  Its really unfortunate that more than a million dollars worth of bitcoin never made it into the ecosystem. It would be great if merchants really accepted bitcoin and used it to pay/bonus staff or pay vendors. So the claim is a little misleading. Shift Card users didnt "spend" bitcoin and merchants never received bitcoin. Should read "Shift ~10,000 users who have transferred &gt; $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin to SHIFT PAYMENTS who then sold it to pay for USD debit card purchases in less than 2 months" .

Of course you do.
Coinbase may well be participating in the community and searching for the killer app but has nothing to do with this VISA DEBIT CARD you are trying to pass off as a BITCOIN Debit Card. Remember this? “Today, we’re excited to introduce the first US-issued bitcoin debit card, the Shift Card.”  This is a bitcoin killer, not bitcoin killer app and you know it. This is about Coinbase digging deep into the payments processor playbook and playing the recurring fee game.
Coinbase benefits and the community does not. Coinbase customers sell bitcoin in an uncontrolled fashion and Coinbase users have no idea what the true cost of their purchase will be until after the purchase has been completed. (see blog details) and Coinbase (will soon) charge a fee for each Shift transaction.
Would it be better that a merchant received bitcoin so they could put some or all it back into the ecosystem? Pay their staff? Pay their vendors? Pay their landlord? Tip their customers?
Of course it would.
But Coinbase is distancing itself from bitcoin.
Shift Card is a VISA DEBIT CARD, nothing more.

There IS in fact NO option here to spend Bitcoin. You obviously have confused "selling bitcoin for USD to apply to a VISA DEBIT CARD" with spending bitcoin.  Nothing philosophical about it at all.  The facts are Coinbase calls it a Bitcoin Debit Card "“Today, we’re excited to introduce the first US-issued bitcoin debit card, the Shift Card.” , the merchant does not accept or see bitcoin and the coinbase account holders have no idea how much the item truly costs until after they sell their bitcoin. Add the impending conversion fees imposed on Coinbase customers and you have a complete dogs breakfast. If people want to expand the bitcoin ecosystem they will not use this VISA Debit card.  Want to unload your bitcoins? Shift Card is the perfect solution. This is a cash grab for Coinbase, Shift and VISA.
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:45:43
You are absolutely right and the endless chatter about bitcoin being better than credit cards for consumers is wrong. As yo point out using credit cards wisely is advantageous in nearly all circumstances. In business its critical for cash flow and tracking/accounting expenditures. In many cases our focus is on merchants looking to manage payable's that would otherwise be done through wire-transfer, WU, etc. Where friction and cost is very high, bitcoin shines.

Thanks. You have just confirmed my point. This is a VISA DEBIT CARD and NOT A BITCOIN DEBIT CARD. This Shift Card has nothing to do with bitcoin. Why are you pretending its a good idea to sell bitcoin without knowing how much you're selling it for? That is silly. Why not strategically move bitcoin into USD when the market conditions are favorable? You dont really understand or you dont want to understand. Coinbase is distancing itself from bitcoin because there is no money in the bitcoin business right now. Heads up my friend, Coinbase is feelin the heat and people are picking up on the pressures of VC's. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:16:54
Its not interesting unless you're debating whether this is a bitcoin debit card or a VISA debit card attached to a forex bank account.  Coinbase will charge Shift Payments 1% to do the USD conversion. Shift then applies USD to the VISA DEBIT card .  Shift Payments will likely pass that 1% on to the Shift Card users as volume builds.  Merchants have their fees set by VISA. Great points on the throughput but demand for bitcoin is stifled by lack of products and services that can be bought with btc.

It behaves and is used as a currency but it's not a currency. As noted by others the friction is on/offramping and caused mostly aml/kyc compliance requirements on the endusers and exchanges. If the ecosystem can grow to a point where that offramping (changing for another currency; Fiat) component is reduced we will have greater participation (more buying) in bitcoin and that would translate into higher prices greater liquidity. Although IMO liquidity is not such a big problem.

Theymos is an early adoptor , started and controls this subreddit  r/bitcoin. theymos also invloved in bitcoin.org which is the "go-to" website for everything bitcoin.... google "bitcoin" it's the first hit
from 
Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Bitcoin's first two developers, Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi. When Nakamoto left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control over the Bitcoin project.
From 2011 to 2013, the site was primarily used for releasing new versions of the software now called Bitcoin Core. In 2013, the site was redesigned into its current form, adding numerous pages, listing additional Bitcoin software, and creating the translation system. Developer documentation was added in 2014.
Today the site is an independent open source project with contributors from around the world. Final publication authority is held by the co-owners, but all regular activity is organized through the public pull request process and managed by the site co-maintainers.
Bitcoin.org is not Bitcoin's official website. Just like nobody owns the email technology, nobody owns the Bitcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Bitcoin.

Shift Card lets people transfer their bitcoin to Shift Payments in exchange for a USD purchase.  This is not spending bitcoin. This does nothing for bitcoin as store of value. Bitcoin is sold by Shift Payments. There will be no reason for a merchant to accept bitcoin if all transactions can be processed in the back-end.  The winners here are Coinbase and Shift with their impending 1% and the fees from churn.  Real bitcoin merchants offer discounts and support/expand the bitcoin economy. The demand for bitcoin will increase as more merchants offer it as a payment option.

Losing $100.00 coins is not a capital loss - buying $100 worth of coins and selling said coins for $50.00 is a capital loss.  Losing the PRIV key for $100 worth of BTC would be the same as losing the password to your PayPal account with $100.00 in it.  The account has your name on it, its your money, you put it there.acquired it. You pay the tax.

No, you may want to research how bitcoin and coinbase work and understand a little tax code. Declare them and you will pay the tax on the gain. There is no precedent for "lost private bitcoin keys" in the tax code. The gains on that asset are taxable. Heres a hint my friend: Bitcoin is not money.  
EDIT: Although the tax code does not specifically refer to Priv keys, there is a gray area that allows claims under section 165 of IRS tax code for "casualty and theft losses".  But even of this section can be used there is a complicated formula and it is based your cost of the coin, not current value.

It would be great if uber would accept bitcoin however the on-call methods uber uses means that it is impossible to predetermine any costs until post service. Bitcoin (currently) cannot compete in a space where Credit Cards are used to  establish your ability and commitment to post-pay any product or service.  Providing your Credit Card number when setting up your account basically guarantees immediate payment to uber regardless of your level of satisfaction.

OK. I think, but Im not sure, so go for it. But bitcoin is not the problem here. Credit cards are the problem here and the fact that your credit card it not yours, it's the banks, and the money spent using that credit card is not yours, it's also the banks, makes it incompatible with bitcoin.

I see you sell ATM's.  So we just wont agree on how successful the industry is or will be. Banks own the consumer hotspots and they will capitalize on the ATM market when its ripe. Forklifting aged ATM technology for bitcoin capable ATM's is nickel and dime budgets for the Banks. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:05:38
This information you provide is 18 months old.  Can you provide some current and reliable information? Before suggesting it "totally makes sense" to invest in bitcoin ATM's , we need "totally current and reliable data". My estimates for 3-5 years for North America ATM's are based on current trends in consumer sentiment, bitcoin regulation, availability of APP's supporting small purchases,  and price. These latest products and services make buying bitcoin convenient and effortless. Recent bitcoin integrations of VISA DEBIT cards like (Coinbase Shift) and POS devices (Ingenico) into exchanges are making the leap from bitcoin to fiat easy. There are certain markets that have large cash users that support bitcoin ATM's but this is more the exception than the rule and as a business model it's not sustainable. I'll also add that the moment it becomes profitable you will see the big banks jump on the bandwagon and convert some of their already installed (hundreds of thousands) ATM's to bitcoin compatible. Dont bet against the banks - you can bet they have the plan in place right now to support and profit from consumers demand for bitcoin. You have a great site.  Good luck.

BitPay is doing a fine job and there is enough resources behind them to see them through.
If Tony and team decided sponsorship money was better spent elsewhere he made the right decision. This is an entirely new industry and its difficult to find the right marketing combo to realize advertising ROI.
BitPay has brought in some pretty heavy hitters in retail and they need to be recognized for that, not slammed here on Reddit.  I remember Paige Freeman scoring the Tiger Direct Deal announcing it in South Beach Miami Jan 2014... that was not that long ago.

Olivier makes good on his election promise. 
Like it or not, Olivier Jannsens is making a case for a focus on Dev's.
Let him run with it.
So lets have a new - "Bitcoin Core Dev Foundation" (BCDF) -  with Olivier and Jim Harper founders, funded by Olivier with support from BitPay, Coinbase, Bitstamp. etc, Wall Street and other crypto benefactors.  Let the current "Bitcoin Foundation" continue with Lobbying, Education, Events, Training, Merchant Development and PR. Membership in the existing BF would be mandatory for Oliviers new "BCDF" with annual dues set at $100,000.00 plus .001% BTC of all transaction volume of all the "BCDF member exchanges BitPay, Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc" and shame the Silicon Valley heavyweights into kicking something to the pot annually.  The revitalized and unburdened Bitcoin Foundation will abolish lifetime memberships immediately and individual membership will be $250 initiation and $100.00 per year.  Individual members can offer services or volunteer to qualify for membership discounts or preferred BF event status. 
Any business that claims to be in the Bitcoin business and expects to align themselves or be recognized by either foundation MUST be a corporate/commercial member ($25k, $5k, $1k)  of one of the 2 foundations. NOT an individual member. So if you are in business in the Bitcoin space and you are wanting to benefit from efforts by the Bitcore Dev Team or Bitcoin Foundation, pay up!

Completely impressed.  What a perfect way to introduce bitcoin. These are great promotional items, company staff incentives, retirement gifts, education, customer giveaways, the zero denominated coins are appealing because they can loaded to any amount.

As you are probably aware, Merchants, who are considering accepting Bitcoin, often dont realize or are not informed that they are NOT required to have a merchant account with a payment processor. Merchants can accept Bitcoin and never convert to fiat or find alternate means of offloading Bitcoin for cash.  Payment processors dont promote this for obvious reasons.
Good luck.
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:13:45
BitPay and any company wanting to expand its market must reach out to the uninitiated. For BitPay to headline a "tech related" event would be preaching to the converted. We, as marketers looking to develop new sources of revenue, cannot spend scarce marketing dollars on events seen exclusively by the people already familiar with Bitcoin. There is no point. That investment is a waste. We in the Bitcoin business need to spend dollars attracting fresh investments new users, new merchants, educating and supporting them.
That is exactly what BitPay did in St. Petersburg and I was witness to that. It was executed perfectly and the results were that BitPay and Bitcoin made headlines and people whom "would have never thought" or "who had never heard of Bitcoin" now do.
I read the article in a Bitcoin publication reviewing how some merchants were disappointed.  The army of BitPay merchant integrators may have been a little overzealous when offering sales predictions to potential St. Petersburg merchants but that disappointment comes with the "breaking new ground" territory. I will offer that had the Bitcoin value continued its trajectory skyward, those same merchants would be singing a different tune as Bitcoiners looked for places to unload new riches.
I had a ball. Spent time at Fergs Sports Bar. Was interviewed by local press and made it to TV news. Enjoyed the game and hype. And was proud to be there as participant in the Bitcoin space. 
Business is a science. Patience is a virtue. Bitcoin will have its day, again.
  
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:29:56
Question:  Are you replacing the POS so the merchant can adopt Bitcoin or is it being replace regardless?
If the former my recommend is they keep their existing POS for conventional payment processing and handle the - low volume - Bitcoin payments on a standalone inexpensive Android tablet using Merchant Apps from BitPay, Coinbase, and Blockchain Merchant App. Nic Cary - Blockchain CEO - gave me a personal demo of their Merchant App  works nice. 
IMHO it will be a while before any large scale end-to-end POS manufacturers embrace the BTC's or LTC's .
We met with one Canadian POS manufacturer and encouraged them to step up.  They were thinking about it. Asked them to let us know and we have not heard from them.
In time we will see options.
Hope that helps.

Hey Bruce, great to see BF reaching out and hope the  thing is contagious. 
The BF has a duty to grow the membership and also to represent the needs of that ever expanding / diverse membership.
Change the membership structure in a way that categorizes members and have the BF provide benefits to each category. This would incentivize paid membership. Do not allow companies to associate themselves with the BF or allow the BF to promote companies unless they are full fledged business paid members (not lifetime or annual individuals).
Create a separate membership (no cost) category for merchants with a separate web-portal and login and have a volunteer committee, made of paid and qualified BF members, create marketing and training and online support for everything from wallet questions to security.
Give BF business members access to the BF Merchant members to promote goods and services.
Get rid of the lifetime memberships and
1.Those that are businesses but joined as a private member need to upgrade to a business membership
2. Industry members but not businesses have lifetime expire in 2 years and its $350 per year. Put some skin in the game. 
3. Non industry members /  supporters - $50 per year.
If you're a small business its 1,000. Midsize 5,000 and deep pockets its 25,000 and every exchange on the planet must be a member.
There is a great deal of financial support - outside of the BF -going to core devs. Can you comment on how the BF will work with these outside supporters?
Good luck Bruce and I look forward to working with a revitalized BF.

Bitcoin is not a competitor to "credit cards" VISA, AMEX or MC.
When you use a credit card (not referring to a prepaid card), you are using the issuing financial institutions money.  When you use bitcoin, you are using your own cold hard cash.
Bitcoin efficiently competes with Interac, cash, Western Union and other payment transfer co's.
Bitcoin, on any real scale, does not offer credit facilities.
Large financial institutions bet you wont pay off your CC bill at the end of the month and will generate exceptional returns for shareholders as a result.  
Without credit cards and other forms of financing, the retail industry would be in big trouble.

As with any currency conversion - all gets lost in the translation. 2 things you could consider:
1. Can you acquire Bitcoin without having to use an exchange? i.e. Get paid in Bitcoin for services you provide. Sell something in exchange for Bitcoin.
2. Can your sister pay for some or all of her bills or the items she needs with Bitcoin?  This reduces the amount she needs to convert which reduces overhead. 
Good luck.

"blame" is not the word . If these issues are of no concern to you disregard them. In retail, it is very easy to calculate the number of customers you have. It is also very easy to assess why you have those customers and what you have to do to keep them.

Smart move for any biz to pivot when the landscape changes.  Bitcoin Tipping, as a centralized re-branded standalone business, will never be a profit center for any one entity unless they can capture/retain and build new products on top of tens of millions of subscribers.

Thank goodness for many that you have hit the jackpot and made millions of dollars in Bitcoin and are living the dream but the BF is not a plutocracy and you are one vote. Good Luck My Friend!

Lots of great responses here. First question is ...Can you currently provide a product or service that you can sell for bitcoin? If so this is the most convenient and economical way to "acquire" bitcoin. It should also be noted that once you have bitcoin, you do not require the services of a payment processor or an exchange to hold bitcoin, spend bitcoin, transfer it, review holdings, etc... .  Second question, Is it a recurring or one time purchase with the S/W vendor in Canada and is that vendor incentivizing you for paying them in Bitcoin (discounts, etc)?

 Sorry you have had so many problems with Bitcoin.
Last week I had lunch at Zcrepes in Fort Myers FL. Great food and very reasonably priced. I knew they accepted Bitcoin as I had been there before. When I requested the bill I told the waiter I was paying with Bitcoin. He came back with a small sheet with a QR Code and handed me my bill. I opened the Mycelium Wallet on my Note4, entered the USD$ amount with tip, scanned the QR Code and bingo!  Completed. This took far less than a CC transaction and it was the first time this particular waiter (who provided excellent service) had a customer use Bitcoin. No training, no POS, no tablet, just good old fashioned service with a smile.

As we all know TigerDirect - thanks to Paige Freeman / BitPay- was one of the first major retailers to announce - at Moe Levins' 2014 Miami Bitcoin Conference - that they are accepting Bitcoin.  Kevin O'Leary - Canadian businessman  extraordinaire  - and his SharkTank, CNBC, BNN, CBC et al associations will play out well for Bitcoin.

Completely disagree. When I recently donated Bitcoin to a Womens Shelter, there was no smell of some indignant punk techno anarchist asshole  associated with it. It was a pure, 100% unadulterated transfer of money to a cause. That's the power of Bitcoin and the benefit to society and the people like me that use it.

Tks, and the companies, Cavirtex/Coinsetters , BitPays, Coinbases, et al have no incentive (rightfully so) to really push that model or spend time/money advocating methods they could not capitalize on. Its BitPay who spent megabucks promoting Bitcoin to the uninitiated- St. Petersberg Bitcoin Bowl and other events, so they deserve ROI and inclusion...but where is the happy medium...?? That is one of the keys to mass adoption IMO.

Michael Perklin using the new Lighthouse crowdfunding platform to sell advertorial space on his C4 website.  "In exchange for your sponsorship we will prominently display your companies name and logo on a new section of our website..." Is this an indication of how Mr. Perklin plans to use his position on the Bitcoin Foundation?  I would like to support an initiative of this nature but it needs a presentation on Lighthouse, or any crowdfunded site, with a little more substance and professionalism. It appears that if Josh Garza of Paycoin fame decides to throw a few BTC Michaels way we will see Paycoin up in lights on his C4 website. It also appears that CASH IS KING at C4 as they offer to write bigger advertorials "Depending on the size of your support, ....".  So now its no longer about how competent your company is or what your company does to support the Bitcoin Community, its about how much money you donate to C4.
A brief business plan might be in order, not just a QR code and a plea for cash for past bills or to pay the staff for things they might have to do or lawyers that might have to review things.

This is a very narrow vision and the Bitcoin Foundation needs leadership that encompasses the needs of the broader community.

The Rog has done a lot of great things for Bitcoin and is entitled to do what he pleases with his assets. Gambling may not be a popular sport for some but has proven to be  rewarding for many groups. In Canada, casinos are regulated and large portions of revenue are distributed to the needy and government funded assistance for those addicted. The USA has similiar programs and If Roger commits the "house" to "pay it forward", which he could well do, then everyone wins. Eric and Roger could join forces with their enormous wealth (and luck) and sponsor some unique social initiatives that would benefit bitcoin and put a positive spin on the community.

Is Michael Perklin not the main security guy for Cavirtex?
"What began with Perklin approaching various exchanges and offering his services, has now grown to a business with a sterling reputation. It works with a number of gambling websites, but also counts CaVirtex and Ethereum among its most prestigious clients. Bitcoinsultants has operated out of the Decentral co-work space in Toronto since it opened in January 2014." 
EDIT:  Apologies for the confusion . I was wrong Mr. Perklin is not the main security guy for Cavirtex.  Although he promotes them as his client and he did do work for them. He claims he has done nothing for them in a long time.

This looks like a very promising and valuable component to online retail.  While Bitcoin promotes "irreversibility" to Merchants, those Merchants lose sight of the fact that consumers enjoy the protection built into CC / PayPal, et al and would not make a purchase in their e-tail store otherwise.

This is a "Stress Test" and a great addition to the ongoing growth of Bitcoin. But this is only a small piece of a big puzzle that needs to be solved.  Mr. Perklin does not understand that the Bitcoin Foundation needs to do more than just Stress Test companies and provide technical certainty to Government, Merchants, Investors and the like. I have commended Mr. Perklin for his skills as a crypto technician but he is nothing more than a technician. He has no vision and the Bitcoin Foundation needs visionaries. He and his co-candidate, Francis Pouliot did an extremely poor job at the Canadian Senate Hearings as they left Senators scratching their heads and wondering what the hell is going on.

Canadian government was very pleased to hear from Andreas Antonopoulos but the excitement was short lived when Francis Pouliot, a candidate for the Bitcoin Foundation- and self proclaimed Bitcoin expert - set Canada back after completely disrespecting and confusing the Senate Speaker about what the Bitcoin Community in Canada wants.

Good move on the Jim Harper vote.  Oliver seems like a good guy but a little misdirected.  His fortune allows him popularity and too many people believe wealth and intelligence are synonymous. He is a good support mechanism for developers and libertarians but not good for the expansion of Bitcoin. Olivier is a big promoter of Cody Wilson who is nothing but a bad odor in Bitcoinland.  The BF needs some savvy bizness people that are mindful of the value and importance of decentralization but are mature enough to understand the power and reality of Government.

Nice work. For the most part this is "found money". Most investors take their original investment out, .5btc and feel confident gambling the rest.  When I say "gambling" I dont mean casino or football, I mean leaving it in bitcoin. So if you are so inclined, get the coins off the site, convert your original investment .5btc to USD on an exchange bitpay, coinbase, etc. or LOCALBITCOINS.com and store the remaining in a suitable "cold storage" wallet. Buying a hardware wallet (trezor) is overkill for now and there are some great recommends on this thread from some smart folks on best wallets.  
Then FORGET ABOUT THEM FOR A YEAR.  You just might be surprised :-)

Terrible for Bitcoin in Canada.  No surprise but its very unfortunate. Cavirtex has been on the decline since the ex CEO Joseph David thought it was better to pump his chest in front of the Canadian Senate than build a team and brand.

In fairness to Jamie they make it clear they charge 2% fee. What spendBT does not make clear is they buy it from you at the lowest rate possible and then tack on an additional 2% allowing spendBT to profit from consumer ignorance or desperation. Only desperate people or people who want out of Bitcoin will sell their Bitcoin at the lowest market bid.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:19:06
This is a convenient but very expensive way to unload Bitcoin. Love the innovation going into Bitcoin but this is not good for Bitcoin or Merchant adoption. Consumers are better off finding merchants who accept bitcoin than selling bitcoin for under market value to pay a visa bill.

I see your point but I wonder if the question could be framed different.

I agree volatility but not trend lower if guilty.

PayPal is owned by eBay and currently being spun off into a separate publicly traded company. VISA / MC are public co's. There is nothing illegal about what Mega does and they are compliant. There are enough people negatively impacted by PayPals, VISA /MC  decision to severe ties with Mega, Mega is then be disadvantaged as their competitors have access to PayPal, VISA/MC.
