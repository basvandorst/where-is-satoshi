"Many of them" already heard about Bitcoin before. 
That's Indians "westernised" people, no reason to assume that they have lower discover rates of Bitcoin than any developed country.

We'll start working on integrating a governing system into the blockchain.
What else? This "no governing" model leads to impasses obviously. It's impossible that every upgrade would take 3 years to integrate. We have to reinvent the wheel, study in the hard way, why people made governing system to begin with.
But we'll be cooler; we'll do that "cypherpunk style";)

Don't remember, I used it too long ago.

I got a good/bad habit of paying for the whole party every time I visit Room77.

Ok. My original message was about V2.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:10:59
What was improved?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:34:47
Look good. 
I'm still missing some non-essential though interesting search options, especially in the DUO search. For example, order by price, shipping-to-my-country etc. The [Duo search]( website has much better options that the one embedded within the OB software.

Great, thanks.

Such a service may work in Ethereum, but won't work in Bitcoin, because you can create a different address for every transaction.
The scammers probably used a different address in each email (if they understand Bitcoin).

Oh, my bad. I was mistaken to think that by OB1 you mean V1. 
I d/l and used it just now, so V2. OB1 search options are indeed better, though sorting is missing. Sorry for misunderstanding the question in the first place.

The Bitcoin address? You can track (using a block explorer) but there's no one to report it to. Those are basic properties of Bitcoin.

Shitcoins Club are just awesome. Their ATMs are all over Poland.

I think he did. If "ethereum has a massive PR machine", then its articles are unbiased and hence ignored by some people.
