Welcome! Don't talk about it too much. Honestly. If it gained a lot, some will be jealous. If it dropped a lot, you'll get a lot of "I told you so."

It's for these reasons bitcoin is very attractive.

Supply and demand. If it's hard to find a buyer, price will drop. If nobody wants it at all, its price will be $0 and it will become a useless coin.

Not blaming bitcoin for sure, it just bothers me that some people describe it as a liberated global money that anyone can use, while in fact its entry point is still dependant on strict private exchanges for 7 years since its existence. Only when it's really open and easy for anyone to buy and sell it we can make that claim. I do believe in its potentiall and that's why i'm interested in it.

Yes. But usually the reason for placing that order isn't to actually buy. It's to create the illusion of the demand on cheaper value in the eyes of other traders, so some of them might think "man I think I should buy before that guy does", which increases the demand, therefore raising the price more. So, it's a price manipulation trick.

Actually you shouldn't. If it failed (which was possible) diversification would have saved your investment. However, you could've allocated bitcoin a higher % than 3%

I think the prices reflect the interest/fear in cryptocurrencies in general since it's still an immature market.

It doesn't have to be a password for withdrawals or trades, because a password can be stolen. A time-base 2FA is more secure, randomly generated, and can't be used twice for any action.

Looking at facebook, google, and other digital giants, they got a huge advantage by selling their users info to the government. I suspect they woud have compete if they offered true privacy for users.

Coinbase and other exchanges won't verify a GCC citizen (countries are not listed) Even if they do, Visa is regulated by the central bank in GCC countries, so you can't buy and sell with these exchanges because they are black listed.

2FA for any trade or withdrawal. That should solve it.

It doesnt discourage people from selling it. The demand is so strong it's pushing the price up. Supply is fixed to 21M coins in the future. Early adopters are taking high risks so they benefit from the price increase.

Or better: 1 password for login. 2FA for any trade or withdrawal. This way it's impossible to be hacked without the phone.

Although crypto is banned in Saudi Arabia, there is one ATM in a my small city. I don't even know if it's real or a scam. It's the only one in the whole MENA region:

I disagree with the last sentence. Switch the word "bitcoin" to "crypto".

It won't be bitcoin but for sure a cryptocurrency.

It means something. Market cap = share price x number of shares.
OP did adjust # shares of these companies to match # of bitcoins, so we can have a sense of btc price if its market cap is near those companies, although it's not logical to compare a company to a currency.

Actually that comparison is wrong. It doesn't mean anything. It can be used to show that the USD is stable and BTC is deflating.
the reason why BTC price is increasing is people's adoption not USD inflation.
