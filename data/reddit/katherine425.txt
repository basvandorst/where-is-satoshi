@_date: 2017-09-06 06:57:02
Yes, some special phrases of exchange, I even don't understand what do they mean in Chinese, so hard.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:52:34
Such a heart-fast-beating night! Our boss went to attend the meeting with governors, and we all know that's for closing exchanges, so I was waiting to buy more Bitcoin at a low price in Okcoin. Eventually, Okcoin got one month more to postpone to close, and the price increases in one second, incredible.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:41:31
The name is DACA.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:40:43
No, cryptocurrencies are fine, but ICOs no, even we don't have any official national policy about banning ICOs yet, but all have been stopped the day before yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:31:02
Yes, a lot, kind of crazy now. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:39:01
I worked all day and I didn't see that you paid so much attention, next time i will post more details. When i wrote this in the morning, I just knew it was canceled, because I was going to go attend and prepared a lot stuff for that, all in vain.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:43:32
All of us were shocked when we heard that it has be canceled. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:39:43
No, I never invested in altcoins, but recently I received many questions about this, I only want to HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:52:54
ok, thanks for reminding 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:06:47
what he referred is a boy, he is famous in China because of bitcoin, the name was KAO MAO, but after he got investment, a big big one from other investors, he disappeared. Now he is a mystery in China, nobody knows where he is, alive or no, just disappeared like water.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:07:28
I think it´s because of the regulations about ICO.

@_date: 2017-09-06 07:41:35
I'm an absolutely native Chinese, but I really don't know how to translate and I don't the meaning in Chinese, can you speak Chinese? Some examples from the exchange, such as sweep ratio, and a lot more I don't translate yet, caz I can't.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:37:59
