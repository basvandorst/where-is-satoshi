GBTC is basically an ETF for Bitcoin, allowing you to own a piece of BTC without actually owning the coins and dealing with the hassle of exchanges.
I'm not sure which investment accounts will allow you to trade GBTC, but CapitalOne Investing is one, at only $7.00 a trade.
The problem with GBTC up to this point is the share price (currently $1600 per share) makes it difficult for small investors to own multiple shares. A lower stock price should help the ETF overall.

It's a funny inside joke, but if bitcoin were to have explosive growth in the next couple years with 1000+% returns, can you imagine the run on Lamborghinis?

This is true, but a 5% gain on $3,000 to $3150 is the same as $12.00 to $12.60. The dilution and lower price simply allows for easier entry.
In other words, a $3,000 investment that rises by 5% is the same regardless of whether you own 1 share at $3,000 or 250 shares at $12.00.
I know you know this, but think it should be stated none-the-less.

Imagine the appreciation value of those coins after a million years, nevermind 19.

Why not just use CampBx? I found it much easier to use than MtGox, and with all the problems MtGox is having, you're just asking for trouble jumping into that frying pan.
Plus, if MtGox controls 80% of the trade like it says (which I don't necessarily believe) then you're just adding to the problem in general. Much better to diversify out.

Here is the thing...
This was a slight bubble. No doubt that can be denied. The mathmatics speak for that. And longterm, BTC quite possibly has a future.
That being said. The ethusiasm hasn't hit yet. We've seen a few articles here and there from reputable new sources like Forbes, Business Insider, CNBC, etc. For the most part, those editorials have been positive-to-neutral.
But that just shows that mainstream journalists are picking it up and journalists above all need fresh new strories so that should start to grow.
The major enthusiasm will happen when one of the network shows pick the story up. Like 60-minutes. CBS this morning. 
That's when BTC will go bonkers and a real bubble will happen. Long term BTC still could have legs, and assuming nothing bad happens to the network to shake confidence, when the mainstream media runs the story the common people will start chasing money and greed will set in. Then the price could go to $2,000 easy.

This is the way I did it anyways...
CampBX accepts Dwolla. You can transfer a thousand per day without a verified account and there is no 30 day waiver period. I would still get your account verified. But your money should get to CampBX in 24 hours or less.
The transfer from Dwolla to CampBX is fast. Getting your money back-and-forth from Dwolla to your bank, well that's another story.

Just my opinion...
The value of bitcoins is too high and the price is adjusting. I think a fair price right now is around $90.00 USD per BTC and you will continue to see it fall until it's somewhere between $90.00 USD and $100.00 USD per coin.
Long-term, I think it will rise again, but it might take some time.
The rush to more than $250 USD we saw recently was caused by an addition of new investors based on an influx of internet and print media coverage. That shot the price up too high and it quickly adjusted as people backed out for profit.
The sell-off was too extreme, so we saw another rise to $140 USD. Since then there have been several bounces between $10-15 USD, but those bounces are now becoming more narrow, which says to me the price is settling-in for a gradual fall.
This represents an initial rush by early adopters, which I think is mostly over. The bitcoin market now needs a stronger foundation, and that requires a growing retail base and wider adoption.
But on the bright side, I think another rush might be coming. Bitcoin needs a major success story. Adoption by eBay? Adoption by Amazon? Adoption by PayPal? Or some other unforseen break in its direction. Maybe the porn industry? Maybe the creators of the agorithm are uncovered and that causes the media to swoop in? 
Who knows, but bitcoins need to be easier to understand and they also need an easier entry point for investing.
In other words, BTC needs a spark so the mainstream broadcast media will pick it up and run with it. It's one thing for Forbes, BusinessInsider, Yahoo Finance or even the Wall Street Journal to run a small story on bitcoins. It's something completely different if 60-minutes or 20/20 run a full scale feature.
If that happens, I think the rush to $250.00 you saw recently will pale. I would expect north of $1000.00 USD if the mainstream media in America grabs the story by the horns and BTC suddenly becomes a household term.

I personally think this is the best thing that could have happened to BTC. The market needed a correction. The community needed a wake up call. The currency needs to mature. The market needs to diversify its assets.
I think in the end this will have a positive impact.

Um...just go to CampBx and trade. Or one of the other exchanges, but CampBx has been quite solid for me.
