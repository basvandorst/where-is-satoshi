I used my wedding money to buy an antminer s1, and have grown  much since. We have never been happier.

What's gonna happen is xt supporters are gonna purge old btc by flooding old btc with transactions permanently, and miners on the old chain will lose interest because the old chain will become clogged and lose value.

You should try meth, Bitcoin will become a distant memory!

 I qualify as an idiot according to this, but I just keep squeezing money from these worthless little bitcoins. I'm such an idiot. :(

Some people don't know implied sarcasm when they see it.

You should get a 500 w power supply instead.
Also you won't want to run those unless you get free power.

Is there a way to prevent mining empty blocks?

 Now I know who to pay to promote my next scam! - said everyone
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:54:43
I disagree with your opinion.
Someone HAS to do something about the network scalability if we ever want it to take off.
Will it be you?
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:10:00
Uhhh does that mean Bitcoin is Jesus?
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:51:59
If that's the case go all in on food water and shelter, and you should be golden.

14  months for me, life changing fascination. My friends think I have gone crazy. I definitely have! So many new opportunities!

Let's remove Bitcoin from the name too. They can just be the foundation.

I loaded my wallet. But then got my fingers stuck in a meatgrinder
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:52:13
Don't be lazy. Be the catalyst of change. Do something now. You have a pretty large amount of work to do before you see 100,000, but anything is possible. I have had my mind blown before.
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:04:52
Butthurt Coinbase...?
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:43:24
The protocol hasn't changed because it hadn't been necessary, people are more focused currently on catching current technology up to meet bitcoins needs.
Changes will be needed soon, but it will be inevitable when the time comes
Whether or not Gavin Andreson is the catalyst of change is up to him. 
Bitcoin wasn't destroyed, it was saved miraculously. Humans make mistakes, and the world learned from it.
If you take home a paycheck, think about how many people were robbed of each single dollar you make.
Nobody is an angel, everybody has shady encounters. Most people wouldn't turn away their brother even if they were shady.
Even greed is ultimately driven by what the individual believes is good.

Two hours late for a gox joke....damn.

You are definitely thinking, but a copy of that blockchain would be way too big, and wikipedia really has no reason to decentralize... Does it?
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:52:01
me !
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:23:41
Good post
Let the fiats govern themselves, we don't want to force fiat to do what it doesn't  want to do. That would make us the feds.
If you have a problem with USD regulations gift cards are pretty sweet...
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:31:19
The only thing you can do is accept the lesson.
Next time try selling something physical. Like a penny or stamp, and sending the btc as a"gift"  this avoids item not received scams. However you should establish loyal customers and only accept new customers with small transactions and work up some credit with reliable customers.
