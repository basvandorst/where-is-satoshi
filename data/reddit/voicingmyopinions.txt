The world isn’t a trade able asset. There is no buying and selling, and there’s no price.

Banks have way to much to lose if they buy bitcoin. They’re all publicly traded which incentivizes less risk, not more. 
So no, banks don’t want any bitcoin at any price.

It’s from a Bloomberg terminal, should be released in Bloomberg Businessweek sometime next week.

Definition of a bubble is buying something only because you think you can sell it for more, without any other reasoning.

Because most mainstream investors want to short. This gives them a way to do it without being exposed to risk. If bitcoin holders see futures at 2,000 then the price of actually bitcoin will probably fall.

Look at your paper money it says “this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private”. It literally is a legal document that cancels debt. The person you owe is obligated to accept it by law.

Thank goodness bitcoin is tied to gold reserves!

The system where you wait and hope enough more people want to buy bitcoin so you can sell to them and you don’t lose all your money.

Today it’s gone 13, 14, 15... buy buy buy buy now! How high can it go’

With gold all you can do is make jewelry and science equipment. With Bitcoin you can trade it online!

Is it unreasonable to think someone that owns a large portion of an asset class can have an extreme impact on the price if they choose to sell?

Probably going to go down sharply tomorrow, so if you want to buy, you should wait until then. Most of the demand is risk free shorting of bitcoin.

Down 8% for the day

The article mentions that they have incentive not to screw each other over, but as the price continues to rise, so does the risk of them cashing out.

How low will it go!!! Buy the dip!

That’s what scares me most about bitcoin. How many people will kill themselves if and when the price collapses? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:48:11
Should be going down to around $7,000 in the next week so that’d be a good buying opportunity.

About to be “was” a financial advisor if you’re implying that your clients should be bitcoin as an investment. What financial goal does that help with? College? Retirement? Did that add going to the moon to that list?

Anyone who says they bought over 16k is most likely a troll.

I think it’ll hit 7,000 at some point this week.
