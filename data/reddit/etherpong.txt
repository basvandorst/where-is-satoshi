Thanks, that's really helpful.

Thanks for your reply. 
I think the transactions are always signed by both parties as they always can "step out" of the channel right. 
They need both signatures then. when a new transaction is made the old one becomes invalid. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:53:53
Thats right!

Crazy, but I actually do quite the same 
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:06:12


It is about comparing certain technologies. Bitcoin is not IOTA.

Yes in the famous backpack street right ?   
Has passed that one too. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:32:59
I only see the channel, you have a specific video which one you mean ? 
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:08:49
You are right  about that, I dont mean to donate too such accounts, my point is the same, that it is possible to censor peoples accounts and bring them into a state where they are not able to function in society.
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:24:47
It is more an explanation of the past 20 years concerning bubbles and what happened when those broke and how that could affect assets like Bitcoin. 
It is not a price prediction in any kind of way.

Its in the description! Its called "heads will roll" 
Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:22:51

Thanks man! Appreciate it! Thats how the world works sadly but true, we can only help by informing people about Bitcoin and showing the real face of society.

Jp morgan, is that you ?
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:23:00
Because they arent doing anything wrong and cutting somebodies funds isnt right. It the same that happened to Julian Assange with wikileaks. The powerful dont like, makes sure the funding gets blocked and try to play the game in that way.
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:03:03
Thank you!

@_date: 2019-11-21 09:23:21
Bit it does express itself in the price as we can see in the chart so that is quite interesting right ?
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:26:26
But that doesnt mean it isnt interesting

Im still reading hut so far, very interesting!
@_date: 2018-11-07 06:37:50
Yes, I agree on that. That's why Bitcoin will always be the only store of value out there. Everything else has nothing to do with storing value. Maybe they are good for different things, but thats another discussion
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:34:42
Exactly. Anyhow both BTC forks are as worthless as their logo's. But can be funny to follow it 
@_date: 2018-11-07 06:36:46
exactly, Mr Wright is Wrong here
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:32:43
Yes haha, or not ��
