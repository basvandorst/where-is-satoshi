what's that called?

Bitcoin and ether are taking different paths.  But Ether is going to run into its scaling issues very quickly here, and ICOs are going to run their tokens on other blockchains that are cheaper.  ETH price has been strong relative to BTC in the last month, largely bc of so many ICOs launching in Dec and Jan that ask to be paid in ETH.  This may change, and hopefully ICOs on other platforms, like NEO, ask not just for the token of the platform but also for BTC.

Putin would be smart to try to buy up a bunch of Bitcoin and turn it into a world currency.  He could do this fairly easily, I think, by completing bilateral trades (maybe with Iran?) in Bitcoin.  That news alone would trigger every country in the world to hoard Bitcoin as well.

That's awesome what you're doing, and it must be pretty exciting to be able to do it.  
Have you considered restricting charities from simply cashing out of the Bitcoin?  Perhaps require a percentage of the BTC to be spent?  Or that the BTC is locked up for the first two years other than for spending it?  Lots of options to consider.  But it would be fun to see if you could get a lot more charities to think of how they could use Bitcoin to help their cause, rather than just using it as a piggy bank.

Seems Chinese should be doing the opposite: stocking up on Bitcoin before it's too late to buy.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:22:11
You don't, but others might, governments and corporations especially
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:24:14
Huh? Speak for yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:29:03
I think that's the right attitude.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:40:28
Does having a global distributed ledger preclude anonymity/fungibility?  I don't think this is the case.  I would argue for true fungiblility not all coins need to be fungible at all times.

BTC, ZCash and/or Monero, LTC, and maybe ETH have long term value.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:02:39
such a random thought there. good for you
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:23:29
Yes, but the analysis can be done at the node.  Jurisdictional issues aside, I think these will be infiltrated rather quickly by governments.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:42:30
I don't think you comprehend much of what you are reading.  Like you have a reading comprehension problem.  For example, you seem to be unable to connect rational arguments or ideas.  I don't think you understand what segwit is or what Bitcoin really is.  Try reading more and yapping less.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:46:13
Good reasons.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:07:56
I think they're not so much trolls dominating r/btc, but people holding substantial more alts than BTC, and hoping for their alt to sky rocket if BTC loses its gold standard.  Certainly a lot of ETH holders, so they may be into ETH to a greater degree than BTC.  Hell, Roger might be one of these ETH holders now, and so he's trying to ruin the Bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:54:36
No it's not at all like saying one company during dot com era. BTC is and will be the standard for value and value transfer.  That's where the confidence lies.  Others tokens can have value too, but their value is speculation now on future applications.  Some may be successful, no doubt.  ETH has been a successful fundraising vehicle, for example.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:42:11
Short story: the people who were into Bitcoin earliest have the most money to throw around to affect the markets.  Roger is one of them.  He decided to buy BCH and probably DASH with his BTC.  BTC drops because of this selling pressure and because traders and weak hands are trying to make a profit or avoid losing more on paper.  Meanwhile, strong hands will hold BTC and not worry.  After the smoke has cleared Bitcoin will again rise.  Large institutional buyers are probably using this as a buying opportunity while there is fear. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:36:47
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:25:48
Yeah, hoping to not have to do that.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:13:52
Really?  The risk profile is just so much in BTC's favor right now relative to alts, imo.  Alts are for just a small percentage of a crypto holder's portfolio, but I think it's becoming so much less offensive to the average IRA investor to have some of their net worth in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:09:26
If they wanted to accept it, why would they buy a huge chunk like that?
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:54:43
Not true. This the first step. They're an investment app, after all.  It's not like people send stock certificates to their house for holding. Let them develop their service..

I hesitated for this reason at a few exchanges, because exchanges in earlier years didn't require as much info up front.  
Question -- Does anyone have handy which regulations govern these KYC requirements? Would an exchange only need this info prior to enabling a user to transfer BTC out of his or her account, or do the exchanges actually need this info up front prior to allowing a purchase of crypto that stays on the exchange?

Unless Craig Wright is putting on some sort of a fool act, as means to an elaborate ends, he did not write the whitepaper or post on the Bitcoin forum as Satoshi.  Satoshi was far more eloquent in his style and careful with is words, even when posting on a message board, than CW has demonstrated even once in his writings.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:45:08
I think people in the know do know who satoshi is, and i think the public has a pretty good guess.  And it's definitely not CSW.  Probably not Kleiman
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:08:38
Eh yeah i kept selling half over and over as it went up in an unreasonable way and my last sale was at a great premium.  but I want my last little bit to count more!
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:35:44
He did, yes, and was upset at the reception he received to his tweet about it.  He seemed confident in his source though, and he's a respectable leader in the community.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:53:22
It's not fake news unless it's not real.  We don't know yet.  They can be considered rumors now, and it creates FUD, but it doesn't mean that they won't end up being true.  We will see.  Watching how the Chinese government has treated bitcoin over the last five years, I wouldn't be surprised if the rumors are true.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:08:59
Ahhh makes sense.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:29:18
Youre giving them away?  I'd like to try
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:54:27
Eh, maybe. I think most people who knew what they were doing and wanted to sell would have planned a little better. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:44:06
Why so harsh? He's providing useful information and he's correct.

Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends
A top rate of 15% applies to qualified dividends and the sale of most appreciated assets held over one year (28% for collectibles and 25% for depreciation recapture) for single filers with taxable income up to $418,400 ($470,700 for married filing jointly). Long-term capital gains or qualified dividend income over that threshold are now taxed at a rate of 20%.

Do your own research.  If you ask for opinions, you'll only find people with vested interest pumping their investments.  Don't trust them.  Study the technology.

I think Ethereum is really interesting for these use cases, but these tech companies and financial institutions have no reason to use the ETH blockchain...once PoS ships it will be cheap and secure for them to run their own blockchains.
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:08:44
These are good points.  It will also be interesting to see how the SEC rules on the Ether ETF considering the regulatory grey area of its ICO.  One would think that because of that it would have an even smaller chance of being allowed, but some of the reasoning for rejecting COIN won't apply as strongly against Ether, such as management, mining conditions, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:16:12
These are good points.  That's the way I've always viewed ETH too.  I am excited to see what kind of tech is built, but I struggle with the view that it should be the reserve currency/unit of account for the digital age.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:20:33
Yes, you are emblematic of ETH traders, and some of you guys will profit, some will hold the bag at the end.  Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:56:49
What do you consider the best coin then? The one that gets the best returns or the one that is supported by the most secure blockchain, or what?
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:17:44
Wow, I didn't realize I could read Russian.
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:58:12
You're trying too hard to be smart.  The market cap represents the wealth held in Bitcoin. Obviously, an equal fiat input is needed to match fiat pulled out in order to maintain price and wealth. The same is for any asset.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:23:39
Those sorts of things need a catalyst, like Mt Gox was for BTC.  Perhaps it will be when segwit or other scaling options are implemented in BTC, or when PoS gets delayed by miners, or an unforeseen technical or economic problem with PoS, or high transaction fees compared to BTC.
