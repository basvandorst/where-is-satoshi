I'm not sure, but Atlas has very low volume.  I've used them and I was happy with their service.

Kids will know what filesharing is so use the analogy of a peer-to-peer network like torrent (if they don't know or for clarity explain that a peer to peer network where peoples computers connect together to share files and there isn't 1 central place where they are being downloaded)  bitcoin operates the same way it exists on this network of computers without a central authority.  Explain then that what bitcoin is is a list of transactions that is kept on this network, this list lets people know who has bitcoin and can spend them.  Then explain that the job of the network is also to secure the currency from hackers.  I hope that helps.

Also I don't really get why they spell bitcoin as "bit-tokoiso" I would think "Bitokoino" sounds better.  Edit: now that I think about it you could even spell it "Bitokoine" why wouldn't they just spell it like that?
