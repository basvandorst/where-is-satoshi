I think he lost his way. The Bugle podcast from before he went US he was much better.

So perhaps the lesson learned is to not reveal you are making satire?

I met a developer back in 2015 that explains it very well imo

Sorry which bank?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:50
Well yes, that does sound much more professional.

Have you used any of the above? So far coming up short for what i am looking for,  could be a go.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:11:04
To be honest, i am only just starting to consider trying to live on BTC. I have been interested for years, but only made a few private purchases over the years.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:48:27
I partly posted this because i would like to buy some skateboarding shoes but i am having trouble finding anywhere in EU, any suggestions?  
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:52:35
Checking, thankyou!
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:49:16
No worries. Perhaps one day there will be bitcoin support in the swish app. You never know : ) 
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:09:00
Thats correct! They never claimed to be trying to find a "beneficial application of blockchain technology" We did : ) and that's where it could get interesting.

Was Hal using horoscope analysis though? : )

Yes! But stacking sats is also confusing language for no coiners and so we a new wave of conversation to come through, one where people can feel involved. The fact Satoshis have the same name as the inventor might also serve to further confuse. Not sure.

appy birfday bitcoins 
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:49:59
It really is and it’s been going on for a long time. Same responses time and time again, I can’t help but think it’s how we collectively talk about bitcoin as a whole unit instead of what it actually represents.
@_date: 2019-10-13 09:59:56
Speak to people in a way that they might understand the various values bitcoin offers. Less tech jargon more lifestyle choices.

Tuff crowd!

I started shooting interviews with key players building applications back in 2015. I focused on the people and the vision, and a little on the tech. See here: 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:11:04
You will but I am recording and editing the interview like I always do if you look at my site. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:30:28
Not streaming no, transcription possible depending on time available. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:21:08
Appreciated, Great questions!
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:45:25
Can you PM me about it.

@_date: 2018-02-18 11:05:52
Thank you kindly! It means a lot that our videos are appreciated. More to come : )
@_date: 2016-10-19 07:45:03
Can confirm, this happened to me a few years back. I was using Cryptsy at the time, and had a currency ticker plug-in on chrome. Basically don't use tickers on chrome. I recommend using WinkDex on the Phone. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:57:42
Thanks! Forever great full!
