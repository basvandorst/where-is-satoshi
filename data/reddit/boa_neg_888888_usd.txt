I met someone through localbitcoins.cons and he offered to do a Bank of America to Bank of America transfer for 1BTC and I agree because I figured it must be secure.
Now Bank of America has put a hold on my account because the asshole used a stolen account and even though it was Bank of Americas security that was broken - I'm the one that will be paying out the ass.
They've locked all of my cash accounts - luckily I hold more in BTC now. They heavily implied I'm going to be robbed of the 1BTC and the $836.55 oh and I forgot the $35 return item fee that will take me a few hours to work off as well.
Now, I see why BTC is the way of the future.
I'm putting up a donation link - I'd at least like to get that 1BTC back to pay off the thugs at BoA before they probably extinguish my accounts and they continue to lock down all of my cash.
TL;DR - Please read. BTC is the way.
Edit: Donation link removed :)

I don't think anyone is appreciating the situation. 
They have locked all of my cash accounts so I can't pay bills or buy things.
They are going to take the $836 back and I lost the 1BTC.
Also, I removed the donation link. It's not worth the controversy. 
Just be careful out there because you will get owned by poor bank security and clever con artists.

What triggered it was my one localbitcoin.com transaction. 
I bought from someone who clearly used a stolen account to pay me and run with my BTC.
I thought it would be secure because it was a Bank of America to Bank of America transfer within the bank.

I took the donation link down.
I am going to lose $836 + 1BTC.
That sucks.

I did and they locked down all of my cash accounts so I can't even use an ATM. They're very hush about the whole situation, but they are going to take back the $836 and I lost the 1BTC.
I removed the donation link, so that this is now just about how screwed up this is lol. :'(
I'm not rich people. I just wanted to sell the BTC to pay rent and now what?
