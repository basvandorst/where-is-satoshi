That is not on bitcoin, that is on Coinbase using ridiculous fees. Use any competent wallets and you can set your own fees.
Pro tip: transfer your bitcoin on GDAX before sending out you coins, it’s completely free and takes less than 30 seconds.

No one calls the original bitcoin "bitcoin legacy" outside of people in Roger Ver's circle and the poor souls that have been successfully brainwashed by him. There is only Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, period.
If you remove some of the noise in these discussion, at the core, Bitcoin Cash is a fork that attempts to scale bitcoin using larger blocks while Bitcoin wants to solve the scaling problem using "layers" (analogous to the tcp/ip stack). Nothing wrong per se in two techs fighting it out (just like the hundreds of other alts) to see which one rises to the top.
The problem is that the Bitcoin Cash folks don't draw the line on the tech. They are actively trying to confuse new comers into the space by claiming that their fork is "the one true Bitcoin", stealing from Bitcoin's growing brand and recognition using shady marketing tactics.

I sent some out last night and it was fully confirmed about 8 hours later. My previous transfer earlier this week took less than an hour.

Only the ones aimed at promoting them or showing them in a good light. Threads which bring into question their legitimacy or promote FUD around them are fine.

I only own bitcoin and have no particular interests in alts at the moment. The Other bitcoin sub has a similarly strong agenda on the other side of this debate and treats btc the same way. This is just what I’ve personally observed on this sub in the last couple of months. I might very well be wrong and this might not be a result of moderation - might just be a result of what this sub wants to promote and that I’m more likely to see.

It depends on how long you held the coins for. Less than a year is considered short term gains, will be taxed alongside your income tax rate. If longer than a year, [it's between 0-20%](
