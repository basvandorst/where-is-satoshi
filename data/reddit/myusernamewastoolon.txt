I can't believe I didn't get into Bitcoin sooner! A friend of mine told me to invest in it a long time ago and have been regretting it ever since Xp.  
Anyways! Hello Bitcoin community from @_date: 2017-09-15 16:15:15
He's saying if you bought $100 of BTC at $4500 and then later bought $100 at $3500 then your dollar cost average is $4000. If Bitcoin rises to over $4000 then you are in the positive.   
   
EDIT: Dollar Cost Average is calculating the average of all the price points you bought at. So, in my example you bought at 4500 and 3500. (4500 + 3500) / 2 = 4000.

Lol same, learned about it back in high school and friends telling me I should buy one. Ended up not buying any, but stayed interested in it and officially started buying a month ago -_- oh the things I would do differently if it was 2009 again.

Every time you purchase now it decreases your the point at which you bought as well (Take the total average of all price points you buy at).
