And then you can say you called it. Cool. Have some optimism are you forgetting you're in ? 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:11:41
I was surprised at everything they mentioned.

You can't ask for the doge, the doge finds you. I think I read that on a fortune cookie.

You be crazy mon

Sex with miners

Get your dildos off my lawn. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:57:19
I'm going to take my business elsewhere then.  
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:26:12
Dude you were owned, the other poster addressed each of your claims and backed it up. You're just trying to make outlandish comments of no substance. Give it up.  
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:54:39
Personally I prefer automobile. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:15
NO NOT FINE
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:19:55
That’s a lot 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:01:47
No need to be a dick about it. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:12:34
Is that Usidore?

Not everybody sits on reddit all day every day

It doesn't happen overnight. More and more businesses are accepting it everyday. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:15:13
Results don't happen overnight. I'm eager for adoption just like the next guy but it's not an overnight thing. Bitpay saw a 5000% increase over last year. There's a reason why we're still referring to this as the infancy of btc.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:25:39
Do you have a crystal ball?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:19:04
I think you need a nap 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:31:24
That is speculation. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:22:44
Just because you've been through two other non-related bubbles doesn't mean anything. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:21:04
It's the majestic plural.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:28:02
A sample size that large must speak for the masses then. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:49:59
I think you need a nap. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:14:23
Raise your chalice
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:02:54
No need to be condescending. You're comparing apples and oranges with no factual basis to back it up. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:01:34
That was so meta 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:34:37
Cool bro
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:15:35
Good rappers need more words to rhyme with.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:39:36
...do you?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:20:50
Stores don't accept gold yet it's a store of value. Until BTC stabilizes people are going to speculate. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:54:34
Or so you think 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:59:29
What are you basing that on? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:26:43
Can't forget about genocide

Europe switches "." and "," when dealing with numbers.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:58:38
I mean a sample size that large must mean 99% of the world knows.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:27:17
Why do you care? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:28:25
They'll need to rewrite the $5 dollar footlong jingle.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:40:12
Cheers!

Your body is a wonderland 
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:12:19
Wait what?
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:02:28
And sharks with lasers 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:51:50
I was going to but the minimum is .1 BTC which can expensive. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:13:23
I might have to do this. It forces people to set up a wallet if they receive it right?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:06:55
Yeah last I recall they only hold roughly 8% of debt 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:31:19
Way to support your argument. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:21:36
I think I'm having déjà vu
