Worked after Hammering F5, it's nice but to clearify it's an Gibraltar Registered Bitcoin ETI that is tradable on Deutsche Börse Zertifikate.

you don't need to wait for LN just wait we have from time to time this high fee's but ok this time was relative long but allways goes back to an normale usable value short after the hype and spam time.  
if you are a few years in the crypto game you see that all little more long term and relaxed there is nothing out there competitive to bitcoin even with the high fee's from time to time.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:36:28
That sad :( iam using it regular for Humble bundle,vpn and usenet but paused it in high fee situations 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:21:07
Just stop using them, Petitions are useless Money is Stronger.

advice new users to not use Coinbase/GDAX there are enough alternatives out there
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:39:21
Your right they removed it sometimes last year ... sad but the there was no bundle in recent time that i wanted to buy
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:44:29
Next Argument of the bcash shills will be "hey look nobody using bitcoin anymore fee's are falling to zero" 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:05:17
I don't think they want to destroy bitcoin they saw an chance to made profit out of the situation.  
After the Difficulty change and the following pump on BCH  they saw a chance to blow the BCH Price through the Roof i think thats why they rushed the release of BCH on Coinbase/GDax i have respect for the perfect timing and i think they made a shitload of money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:51
Great Post thank you

@_date: 2014-04-15 13:07:28
i have lost also a lot of Money and ?
I don't expect champagnes.
This is an high Speculativ Market with massiv Market Manipulation i buyed some shares back and if i'am lucky cut loses in a few years.
There is nothing that justifies the threat of violence agains Danny or other Neo&amp;Bee Employers
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:47:52
Thank you Danny that clears many things to us investors.
I hope you can resolv the Issues in Cyprus, und bring Neo&amp;Bee back to life.

Without an Prove that you are an Ex Neo&amp;Bee Employe i belive you nothing !
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:19:30
No one is telling you this is good news, it's very bad at all ... but nobody outside Neo&amp;Bee knows whats realy happend.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:03:34
jep brought 4 coins totay only to see this bear trolls burn their asses ;P
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:15:52
Don't know if there is something on this theory there is no evidence, but it's spooky every time something possitive about neo&amp;bee are in the media this trolls pop up and try to beat the mood down.
I have used this situation to buy my shares back and now i'am just waiting whats happening.
We need Companys like neo&amp;bee to bring Bitcoin to the Masses. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:36:53
it's super simple just move your decimal 
6 positions to the right for Bitcoin to Bit  
6 to the left for bit -&gt; bitcoin  
0.00347 = 3470 bits  / µBTC
  
it's very simple  
if you are working in the metric system you do the same every day so it's logic not confusing the name is only an pseudonym for µBTC
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:28:57
WTF is happen here :D
This is an Epic Troll Battle, accounts just with Posts agains Neo&amp;Bee or just one Post wtf ? 
what is the aim of this action ?
People calme Down, it's just Money most of this Troll Posts are still FUD spread around since weeks.
Time for Popcorn, this Sock Puppet Show is better than the TV Programm ;P
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:00:43
Amazon needs Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Amazon ,)
You can buy via Gyft but the better option use one of the other online shops with bitcoin support and show them what happend to the Dinosaur ;P
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:12:44
Lol, and there are people/bots downvoting all posts who declare this as FUD news it's so funny ;P
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:36:13
All this hate against Danny brings an Dark light on the Bitcoin Community, Thanks for the admins cleaning this mess.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:10:34
Thank you for this open letter to the Community.
Now we know both sides of the Story, Neo&amp;Bee is still an great innovation to bring BTC to the masses it's so sad that things goes wrong only 1 month after opening.
My Question are:
Is there still Hope for Neo&amp;Bee or possible an new Company out of the ruins?
Whats happend to lmb-holdings.com it's down for over week ?
@_date: 2014-04-25 04:31:38
Not true, it works again ;P
I have the feeling the trick works for the 10th time.

@_date: 2014-11-05 07:25:12
Interesting Interview he see's Bitcoins as a Part of their System "Once it's Regulatet" but he's not telling us what excactly has to regulate and only as a new Currency in his System so possible his Plan B is to transfer Western Union into an Bitcoin Exchange this is good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:30:30

if something cost 120 Satoshi you can also say (Plan A) 1 Bit and 20 Satoshi it's like 1 Dollar 20 cent  
Satoshi as the smallest possible unit will not disapear.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:07:37
FUD! 
Read the Story there is no official statement from Neo&amp;Bee about the freeze.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:16:29

This Time it looks like more and more people are Resistant to that  :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:32:04
Reminds me of the Picture just a few month ago 
Is there any reason why so many miners swear on GHash.io, and why is there no size for p2pool ?
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:38:52
I hope so, waiting for a dip to sub 1k to buy in again possible we will see some bad news before the weekend that drives the price down.
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:34:30

@_date: 2017-08-27 08:38:16

Germany here, i think most of the "older people" had the DM in mind and think the EUR has the same stability and nobody here looks at the USD, prices thanks to the Oil Market are still stable it's like boiling a frog just wait and see what will happen when QE meets rising oil price next year ,)
