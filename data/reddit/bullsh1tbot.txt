You are correct, coininspace may be incorrect, though I don't think so.
But tellingly u/Cryptolution 
* Will post some evidence supporting his view
* Somebody will attempt to refute said evidence with a nuanced reply that takes some time to produce.
* Cpryptolution will then reply with ad hominem, I have never seen him address individual points logically, eg. [1]( or [2]( from recent times.
Unfortunately he is very typical.
But you can make up your own mind!

I never thought I would say this but I have to agree with u/pokertravis. for all his talk u/Cryptolution shows that he doesn't understand bitcoin ie Nackermoto Consenus. 


Every mined block is another confirmation securing the network, what are they supposed to do turn off their miners until they have verified all transactions.


all actors are free to do as they please NOT WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO. that's a permissionless system for you.
unlike your last sucking up to greg comment that demonstrates you don't believe in a decentralized system
[Honestly, im very happy greg is advocating for a more rigorous, tested, slower rolled out UASF. Its much more likely to be successful and non-contentious when done through the proper channels.](
the proper channels!

unfortunately for you and u/RHavar u/albinopotato is correct
It's not the same. p2sh is protected by a signature on both chains whereas SegWit tx's are only covered by a signature on 1 chain better hope it's the one that wins.
now with your UASF splitting the chain without super super majority hashpower ( a certainty, have a look at testnet, that's why SegWit needs 95% ) 
all p2sh coins will be nice and safe on both chains, SegWit coins not so much.
