The name Bitcoin "ATM" is a bit of a misnomer... These machines are not ATMs in the traditional sense that you are simply withdrawing money from a bank account, but rather more akin to a currency conversion window (like a money changer at the airport), or a physical FOREX exchange. You are converting cash into Bitcoin, or vice versa. 
There are 2 considerations that are taken into account for costs when buying/selling BTC on a BitcoinATM:
1. You will have a spread, which is common for any currency conversion. This means you will have a buy price that is higher than the market rate, and a sell price below market. This is done to offset slippage, volatility and other risks the operator of the machine takes on to provide Bitcoin inventory on the machine. 
2. As well, there will be a transaction fee associated with the buying and selling. These fees, as mentioned elsewhere avg 5.8%, which may seem high at first glance, but understand that the operator is providing a machine that you can simply walk up to to buy and sell Bitcoin immediately. They have all the expenses of a traditional ATM, but a fraction of the volume to cover expenses and ROI. 
As Bitcoin matures, there could end up being lower volatility which would equate to tighter spreads. More transactions per machine will decrease fees. Today the machines operate in a low volume / high volatility space, meaning a lot of risk to an operator. Hence the higher fees for the convenience of being able to simply walk up to a machine and convert between cash and BTC.
Hope this explains a little of the economics of the BitcoinATM space.
