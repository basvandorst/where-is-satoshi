The first couple of days they had a chance, but now i'm convinced you are right.
Look at my questions zane has been avoiding. They only reason he cannot answer is because I suspect all the crypto is gone now &amp; we may only recover USD in bankruptcy.
This is going to be a lot worse than people losing 119k BTC or 36% of their assets.
Bitfinex won't be back online. Zane is just delaying a real investigation. Assets should be frozen by now.
Why can't coindesk reporters get some feedback from the CFTC?
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:48:59
Withdrawls will be available, or we can only view our balances when the site is back online?
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:48:08
Personally. I think we've lost ALL the crypto. It's all highly suspicious by now.
I suspect we'll be even worse off than a 36% haircut, when the truth comes out.
Zane is delaying a real investigation. He's only keeping us distracted.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:44:48
They probably wont.
But, it's a much better solution because no ETH, LTC, USD need to be sold and redistributed among users.
Only BTC would be replaced,  How do we know that 36% haircut is accurate or that they havn't run away with all the crypto and zane isn't just distracting us anyway?

How do we know that 119K BTC lost was equal to 36% of total deposits?
Does bitfinex have proof of reserves?
Can you list the total number of
BTC,LTC,ETH and USD that users had deposited with you.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:59:49
Isn't it better you replace only lost BTC with 'BFX-bucks'?
Why take 36% of users USD, LTC or ETH balances? 
Are you planning to sell those non-BTC assets on other exchanges, to replace half of the stolen BTC? (have any been sold yet)
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:26:23
They could easily replace BTC with BFX-bucks, and leave USD, ETH, LTC unaffected.
It makes no sense what they are proposing, unless LTC/USD/ETH are missing, or being stolen also.
I think all the crypto have been stolen by insiders at Bitfinex. Good luck if this 36% haircut is even true and we get to withdraw. 
Zane is delaying a proper investigation by getting us to debate over social media forums.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:19:56
CFTC also, Coindesk should be calling them up and reporthing their comments.
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:52:34
Why not replace the lost BTC with BFX-bucks only? I think this makes a lot more sense than 36% haircut on all assets.
Non-BTC assets (LTC, ETH, USD) will be unnaffected.
If Bitfinex can’t replace the 119k BTC (valued at approx $70million) with equivalent USD from an investor or insurer, then crowdfund this debt with BTX-bucks.
If you make 70,000,000 BFX-bucks exchange traded, holder have the opportunity to exit a $1 and breakeven (assuming they reach this value).
Everyone could quickly continue trading/exchanging/withdrawing where left off &amp; it wouldn’t damage the exchange that much.
Also, you wouldn't interfere with the market or customer accounts by selling non-BTC assets on the market.
will you pass this suggestion on to management &amp; your legal council, and confirm to us why they consider it to be a bad idea.

@_date: 2016-08-08 13:13:57
can you verify this
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:49:59
Does it not appear that bitfinex and bitgo were both compromised?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:49:55


**What is the number of BTC, LTC, ETH and USD amount that was deposited at bitfinex.**
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:04:28
Coindesk and other reporters should be reaching out to the CFTC for comment.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:22:12
What i have proposed is much less complex.
If anything, the socialised loss scenario is going got be an 'accounting nightmare'.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:51:18
Why take 36% of users USD, LTC or ETH balances? Can't you replace only BTC stolen with 'BFXcoin'?
Are you selling these on other exchanges to replace half of the stolen BTC?
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:59:34
How is bitfinex based in Hong Kong?
Are any staff residents there, or is it just a HK registered office address?
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:48:52
Yes, i cannot understand what kind of lawyer would give this advice.
Has bitfinex consulted with, or received any guidance from the CFTC regarding this plan?
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:18:43
Couldnt agree more.
Failing that and we don't get any transparency, how about this much better solution.
It's all highly suspicious now. And i seriously believed they have stolen all the crypto. We may only get whatever USD is left in the banks.

* How do we know that 119K BTC lost was equal to 36% of total deposits?
* Can they tell us the total number of BTC,LTC,ETH and USD that users had deposited?
* Does bitfinex have proof of reserves?
* Are they going to sell non-BTC assets to cover half of the lost BTC?
* Bitfinex coins should be traced and treated as stolen property. Exchanges or BitGo ought to freeze them if they can. ( The founders/management may be criminals )
* Zane won't be transparent about this! I think coin desk are trying to hide something too, they don’t want this being posted in article comments.

Its all highly suspicious. He is ignoring the most important questions.

Zane won't be transparent about this, DESPITE MULTIPLE REQUEST.

@_date: 2016-08-08 12:36:08
What are their names (people in HK)? Where is the CEO and founder currently?
You never give specifics such as names or numbers.
It's always "multiple authorities", "various countries", "a member of the team" etc
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:41:01
Youv'e caught Stockholm Syndrome!
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:23:01
They have a virtual office address in Hong Kong. I don't believe any directors are actually there.
Does know which countries the CEO, founder and all directors of bitfinex are currently residing in?
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:36:29
Absolutely, this is looking more and more suspicious as time progresses.
We need to know:
- Total BTC deposits
- Total LTC deposits
- Total ETH deposits
- Total ETC deposits
&amp; Total cash USD held in bank accounts.
How do we know that 119k BTC represents 36% of the total assets?
It could be lower (say 10%), thus bitfinex are stealing from customers if we accept their figure.
Do they have proof of reserves?
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:21:04
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:58:43
Could we ask Kraken to be independent investigators? They have past experience with investigating the MtGox bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:59:48
Do you have proof of reserves?
What is the number of BTC, LTC, ETH and USD amount that was deposited at bitfinex.
This is not transparent.
Is 36% = 119k BTC / Total deposited assets ?
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:44:05
Have any non-BTC assets (i.e USD, ETH, LTC) been sold on exchanges or with OTC entities, to replace lost BTC yet? Bitfinex staff may be criminals and no assets should not be moved until there is some independent oversight IMO.
Are you sure your colleagues are squeeky clean? I am not.

It will turn out to be an expensive Pizza
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:14:23
He clearly doesn't have all the answers. Zane is the wrong guy to be asking i think.
He'd be better off resigning  and let someone else from bitfinex talk to us instead (especially if he has any suspicions that his co-workers may be crooks - which is becoming more and more likely).

Will you be allowing withdrawals before trading comes available. Or are we waiting for both to be activated simultaneously.
