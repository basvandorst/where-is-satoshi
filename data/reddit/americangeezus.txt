Trust him and all of the CA's that tell you that you should trust the next CA and the next CA, etc.. until you get to the CA that says you can trust him.

Who exactly benefits from the generic bitcoin ad? It doesn't list an exchange or farm, replace bitcoin with CAD and where does it fall?

Since when is mere criticism grounds for conviction if its not baseless slander? 
Edit: Or, why aren't independent parodies of companies actions not taken as commercial benefit when they improve the sales of a competitor of the parody even if that wasn't the intent. "Oh, lol western union. how silly. LOL, Bitcoin isn't anything to take seriously lololol I am going to one up WU by making a gotchya of western unions ad featuring bitcoin."

Its really best if we just wipe the part of history out of it. It just makes people ask too many questions that bring up lots of trigger warnings.

HA, we are arguing about something only lawyers and mba's care about. There are no souls involved irl here. :D

Click through to the gfycat page and you can zoom in well enough. 
ALSO, its really not hard to tell what it is if you are looking for a shiba and are on a monitor with decent resolution.

Because you can't show that the work to create the message was done to promote any commercial entity. Bitcoin itself is a currency with no government or corporate underwriter. Who are you going to accuse of commercial gains for the copywrite infringement when there is no link between a beneficiary of the endorsement and the creator/poster?

I know of a mine who's tailing's are about 3% per ton Gold, molecular, but they can't setup a cyanide leechfield because of -hippies-. So they use it as back fill. 
Most commercial gold mines operating in the world would kill, and have killed for less gold per ton. 
SO, I think that the wife might be better used in another capacity.

Way past pioneer stage with bitcoin. 
Should have stayed on the rocket.

But experience an exponential loss in value if they are, somehow, used.

"HEY! You little shit, you thought we paid you that money for something you did to earn it? Fuck no we didn't you get the fuck out there and you spend your last paycheck so we can get back what is rightfully ours. You don't even get to think about saving until you are a salaried employee with stock options."

If the government recognized BTC has a currency it would be an MSB. But currently he just sells and buys a digital item, and I imagine that he would be breaking the law if he wasn't taxing those transactions under the CBJ/State sales tax. That is how i think they would have to be described in a court of law, but I am not a lawyer.

"if the broker or dealer transfers funds between a customer and a third party that is not part of the currency or commodity transaction, such transmission of funds is no longer a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity. This scenario is, therefore, money transmission."
So, the bullion place sub-lets to a business formed as an S-corp. Make it clear that one part of the commercial space is a separate business that trades in BTC. All income from an S-corp is considered personal income that with a single share holder means the transaction is between the customer and the business owner himself "DBA" the S-corp.
That is where I would start looking at if I wanted to avoid being declared an MSB.

The place is located a good 20 dollar cab ride or a once an hour bus ride from Downtown. Its a poor location to attract the tourists and cruise ship workers, imo. Especially considering the number of open retail spaces located downtown you could get fairly cheaply.

Cheers man. Wife's last rotation was today. I think I might hold onto the hecla.

You can pay state fines in gold there. Not something they advertise, but its done.

That's generally for the on street store front, it gets cheaper has you move into the various buildings and up a floor. With an 8 month lease starting in Feb. I was looking at 1,200/mo for space in The Senate Mall downtown, no utility obligations, that is incredibly reasonable.

I don't doubt there are more than a handful of people in Juneau that deal in BTC, I know of atleast one miner(its funny cause he works at Greens Creek too!), but I don't know if they use them beyond playing the market I know he has never actually purchased anything with BTC.

This is why I am so weary about pot legalization in WA, the popular vote might lul people into a false sense of security and then used against them if they are brought up on un-related federal charges.

I really don't know, the problem I always encountered with every business service in Juneau(Advertising CCW/Empire/KTOO/Realtors) was they never had any hard data on things like that. I know the quilt shop does well enough on the second floor to only be open during the season. And a business like this is something people will lookup when they need it, its not the kind of business that is going to rely on walk in foot traffic, at least not the Bitcoin part. 
Fun story about the CCW, the distribution numbers they give to advertisers are numbers of copies they leave at stands and deliver to various business. They re-collect whats left over when they deliver the new issue but they don't disclose how many were left. They simply give you the number of copies they printed each run.
Also rumor from the Homebrew meeting, the Alaskan Brewery pays 4,000/mo and signed a 5 year lease with terms to get out earlier. I know they run their online store out of there now but that space is huge.
