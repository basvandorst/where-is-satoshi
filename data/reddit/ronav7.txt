Seems like it was a good thing that I procrastinated before investing for 2018 (December 15th until now). Let me go procrastinate some more.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:30:50
Urm.. time to buy more BTC or wait a few days? Anyone with some technical analysis insight?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:42:22
Simple question. Setting up my Nano ledger. I want to choose segwit but will there be any problems if I frequently send and receive from exchanges? I use alot of exchanges and I'm worried that my bitcoins might just end up lost... 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:44:47
I tried my best to. Didn't know where to. Coinbase not allowed in my country, tried bitstamp, they are still verifying... local bitcoin lowest selling price was at 11k when the market price was 9k so I didn't..  huhu.. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:37:11
I'm from Malaysia. I used Luno but it's way overpriced. Should I do a trade on localbitcoins.com?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:50:44
I did bruv. Tried sending to that address and yet...same fees... 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:15:42
Thank You, fellow countryman
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:22:02
No actually. Most of the articles I've read recently said 8 to 9k would be a good entry point. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:51:01
Hmm alright. Thanks!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:47:10
All I wanted to do was send 0.001 BTC to test my new Nano S. But the fees was 0.00154....  why.. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:12:56
In dire need of help. Where can I buy bitcoin for the market price with fiat other than coinbase or GDAX? The exchange in my country is showing a price of 17k USD. :(
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:53:29
Just went through bitfinex. Not accepting new accounts registration till the 15th. Site looks sleek though. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:14:08
Guys I need to buy some bitcoins quick. I can't use Coinbase/GDAX. Local bitcoins people are selling at an expensive price and I'm a cheap fella. Close to market price, with a debit card maybe? Suggestions please!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:21:33
Malaysia. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:24:23
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:34:21
Still looking for the buy in chance at 8k some guys with technical analysis were writing about..........
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:18:09
Really? Hmm.. my country isn't in the list of Coinbase.. think I can buy and send my BTC elsewhere real quick? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:16:14
Waited too long damnit hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:52:58
Right I think I will do that too. So you open a trade with the price you set, am I Right? Not just clicking the buy option on the homepage ads? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:00:18
Ahh I see..hmm guess I'm stuck then. I'm just thinking how longer will this high fees continue.. it's likely to put the newcomers off bitcoin..hmm
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:06:22
Hahaha indeed I am. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:57:09
Oh okay. So I have to have my private keys before the fork happens or can I do it after the fork and still be able to claim them? The transactions fees is still too high right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:07:48
Thank you bruv for trying to help me but I don't quite understand. Tell me where I'm wrong, please:
1. Buy BTC.
2. Convert to Litecoin.
3. Send LTC to Electrum. 
4. Send LTC to Bittrex, convert back to BTC.
5. BTC is now in Bittrex wallet?? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:25:56
Anyone here from Malaysia or Singapore? Luno isn't processing deposits due to some issues with the bank. What's a reliable place to buy BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:15:09
Yeah agreed. Though for me, I rather not buy or sell for a while after a profit trade. I tell myself okay I did good, and try not to think about the what ifs.. I'm new so it's too stressful to leave a buy or sell order there for long lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:17:02
I know that feel, bruh. Hope you didn't lose that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:41:14
Why good sir, if I may ask? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:59:46
I'm a newbie here and I just bought in a significant amount finally at the price of 10.8k. What should I do, with regards to the CME futures? Hodl? Sell now? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:07:57
Malaysia? Bruh.. are you a Malaysian or someone who is just travelling? Because I heard you can't use Coinbase in Malaysia. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:37:51
You had me there. Haha thanks man. I'm gona be off the charts and go do something.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:59:26
Been hodling ever since I bought. Just got into the bitcoin scene 2 months ago. But just now, I thought hey it's going down, maybe I could sell now and buy at a cheaper price. So I sold. Exactly right before the rally started. Waited a few minutes and bought back because I shat myself. Lost 0.001 BTC. I learned something today. I'm just going to buy and hold. I'm sharing this because maybe some of you are new and are thinking of doing this. Think twice. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:28:52
Guys just a simple question. Say I want to place a small bet on a fairly new crypto which could potentially be big in the future, where do I go to discover them and read up about their technology and the problems they would solve things like that?? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:38:48
Hey everyone. I want to learn about trading bitcoin from the basics, the only thing I have traded in my whole life before are a Graveller and Kadabra. Can someone tell me where should I start? I want to learn as much and as deep as possible to do some technical analysis. I'm an engineer btw. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:15:05
Wow so that's your explanation for why the market is so volatile? Wow. Oh and while you are telling me what to do with my own hard earned money, why not tell me where to spend my money on dinner later as well? I'm thinking Chinese but hey.. you can decide that for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:47:42
Haha great feels so reassuring to hear that. :p
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:01:38
Hmm okayy. But then what about the altcoins I'm holding there? Oh and which exchange would you suggest? I can't use GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:31:34
Yeah but I can't help but think okay what if... I converted my BTC and hold the Litecoins now in my wallet right..then I go to bed.  And wake up and BTC jumps like 30%. That would mean that I am losing some BTC right? Am I missing something? Huhu
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:59:31
No sir, they are all still in the exchange's wallet. What should be my next step? Thank you so much for your help. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:28:08
Ahh okay I get it. So it's like currently there is no choice but to risk missing out on BTC's rise if it did. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:43:30
As in 10 transactions were completed?? What was the fees btw? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:44:13
I use Luno to get my bitcoins. Can't access coinbase from my country. And it only has ETH and BTC exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:57:12
Oh snap so I have to do it today then. Any simple wallet which you can suggest to me?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:28:17
Thank You!! :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:33:07
Yes good point. It's just tough looking at the chart dipping like that sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:02
Thank you my good sir. I needed that. My testicles are now fortified. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:44:45
Thank you so much. Urm just a little curious, on what basis did you decide to no longer hold BTC when the majority thinks otherwise, with most of them saying it will touch 100k very soon..? Just want to get your opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:43
Yeap. It's okay I learnt my lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:55:38
Right. Cus right now every time I trade I look at the fees and it's always 0.000. Thanks for the heads up, will be careful about that :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:17
So what's the consensus on IOTA here? There is a 50% discount currently. Thinking about buying it with some ETH I have.. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:04:15
Wow thank you, crypto's own rotten tomatoes. Nice. I'm assuming you trade, I'm just starting. Is the goal of trading in crypto is to complete a buy and sell, and in the end ending up with more BTC than you had previously? Is that how you profit, or is there any other way to measure profit? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:53
Hello everyone, noob here. Anyone knows a good place to learn about technical analysis for trading, right from the basics to advanced? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:23:42
Noob here. Thought of diversifying so converted 25% of BTC into ether at 17k. Ether was 720. Now both are dipping. What do i do?! *panicking*
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:38:15
Will check it out. Thank youu :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:41:45
Because I was thinking off buying some BTC, storing it in my wallet and forget about it until the end of next year.. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:50:29
Yeah that's the thing. Sometimes I get confused.. would it have been better to just hold that ETH or trade for more BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:28:17
Guys I'm fairly new to Bitcoin and I currently have a bought a fraction of it in Luno. About the fork, how do I make sure I get the free 1 to 1 BTC and the other BTC variant? Thanks in advance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:16:54
Hmm sorry I'm abit confused. To buy back into BTC from Litecoin, wouldn't I need to transfer the Litecoin back to another exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:51:08
Same story here with ETH. My first ever "trade" and I'm now just holding those ETH. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:27:35
The majority as in all the information I am getting from reading crypto news, media, etc. But you are right. I need to look at it objectively and form my own belief on where it's headed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:24
I'm using ETH to trade back and forth to increase the amount of BTC I have without adding in any fiat. Is this an okay thing to do?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:49:21
Yes bro true true. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:17
Thank you so much for this! I will prepare all of this before investing more. I only have a small amount in the exchange right now which I'm experimenting with, trading etc.. fingers crossed the 100$ I have in bittrex as ETH stays safe.. huhu
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:07:14
1. So it's really okay to not have any private keys before the fork? I can still redeem them later on? Because I'm afraid I would mess it up if I rush into it huhu
2. Yeah that's what I was thinking..are they hinting that Satoshi is in fact one of them??
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:02:00
Guys noob question. Let's say I want to send 0.02 BTC from the exchange to my wallet, electrum, what would the fees be like? I'm hearing that any transaction now would be expensive?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:37:39
Oh my god thank You! :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:08:13
Yeap I'm keeping some ETH which I bought at 0.0429 as well. Let's see....
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:27:47
Yeap. More fun than when I was betting on Ecuador U19 to score a goal. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:20:23
Haha yes I never intended to use coinbase for trading. Urm I'm actually using the blockfolio app right now to do the same thing. Is there a difference? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:48:19
I haven't traded that much amount yet to incur fees. Just started so no fees for now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:45:54
Thank you. I'm browsing it right now. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:21:52
Awesome idea!! You sir, are a good man. Please do Asia too. I just need 2 BTC to fund a long overdue computer science degree. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:24:03
Expected something better but oh well. Alright.. I'm an idiot. Happy? I'm new to this.. and just when I was thinking the community here is so cool and genuinely helpful.. sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:39:37
Haha yeap I figured as much the few months I have lurked over here. I shall choose my words more carefully...
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:00:05
Hmm interesting, and I have to say I agree. I just hope that with Lightning and maybe other solutions in the future will help solve these problems. *fingers crossed*
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:32:11
Ahh crap. I don't think the transaction would be cleared if I transfer now. There goes my free money huhu.. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:24:34
Ahh okay got it. I'm thinking of electrum, what's your opinion on it? Does it store ETH and LTC? Thank you for your time, seriously. :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:46:27
Alright nice. I just made a 10% gain on that trade in terms of bitcoin amount used for that trade. But I wonder I will be this lucky every time.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:34:51
Me too. Based on the little research that I have done, I wanted to get in on BTC, Ether, LTC and IOTA. But then looking at the BTC progress I just invested solely on BTC first. Will hold :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:04
Alright will do. Need to really believe in them. I really like ETH that's the thing so I'm wondering if the trade is worth it. Also, the similarity in the charts of BTC and ETH is.. scary today. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:05:31
Later buy back into bitcoin? Urm..but what if bitcoin shoots off..? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:13:33
Alright got it. I'm sorry I'm still new to this so I  haven't invested much in it. But how do I go about getting the private keys, if you don't mind me asking. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:52:41
Yeah. I do not sell unless I'm getting more BTC for it. Wonder if it would work this way most of the time. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:17:47
Btw, the donation is to be used for a kidney transplant. It's expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:52:07
Okay a few things to get expert opinion on. 
1. If I send the BTC now from my exchange to Electrum, can I make it in time to claim my private keys before the fork?
2. They said you will receive a proportional amount of Satoshi's bitcoin, what is the ratio? Or is it 1:1? For example if I am holding 0.1 BTC, will I have 0.2 BTC after the fork? 
Thank you in advance!
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:49:01
Yeah. Worst is no one offered any advice. I guess they are all sceptical, maybe I should just start a thread with all the proof instead. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:18:51
Oh my god this dip is so juicy, I wished I have more fiat to put in damnit..
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:27:53
Sorry I don't understand.. 50k as in price? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:44:30
Hmm.. even hodling now seems like a bigger gamble than it used to be... 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:42:41
I need to be friends with this guy. Anyone has this trustees Facebook? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:58:55
So the trustee said that he will consult on further sale of the 165k of remaining bitcoins. Meaning every time it goes to a high enough price he will sell.. and crash the price.. what are your thoughts about this? I'm afraid this could mean possibly a year or more of a bear market.... 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:27:37
Yes.. urm so would it be wise to buy now? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:28:54
True..  that's why I'm thinking like even if you buy the dip.. and it rises.. this guy is going to keep bringing the price down so.. urm what is the point? 165k BTC is quite alot. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:19:43
Guys urm, what is the range where you consider high volume for BTC? I keep seeing people say it's low volume, hence it's just a small pump. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:58:43
Simba, remember, the ones who are telling you to sell are the ones that have already sold earlier than you...Remember who you are... remember...
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:15:19
Maybe millionaires don't need to get bitcoin to be rich? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:12:42
Hmm. A post I read just now about how not money, but the general opinion is what moves the market makes alot more sense now. I'm still new to all this. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:10:23
So why is this not a dead cat bounce like the few days before?
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:09:24
I have my last stack of fiat which i have set aside to buy during dips. Are we going lower than 6k?
