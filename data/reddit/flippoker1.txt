Hi there, sorry for the delay.
But just want to inform you that our "automatic deposit" service has been fixed. So now all deposits will be instantly (no delay).
Best regards, Flippoker

Now our new version of the site has been released.
Now we have a more userfriendly design and some other features going to be implemented in the future.
The mobile optimizations is still in progress, but it will be done eventually.
We still offer some free coins so you guys can try it out :)

Yes, we were under "development/testing" during that period. But now it's fixed :)
But please respond anyway if any issues appears.

That's right, my "first language" isn't English and I apologize if it appeared some misunderstanding. I will spell-check and correct our mistakes. We're a legit site that just want to deliver a good gambling experience.

That's some really good feedback. We don't know what's causing the issues on your Nexus 10. But we will try to figure it out.
A good idea also to implement a "counter" for the faucet.
Thanks for the feedback.

Now we have decreased the waiting time to receive your faucet from 1 hour to 10 minutes.
You can only claim a faucet if your balance is "below" 100 Satoshi (0.00000100 BTC).
We have also implemented a feature that informs you when your next faucet will be available.
We hope that you and many others will enjoy spending their time at our gambling site.
Best regards.

We have recently launched and we're going to get higher limits on the bets in the future. Meantime the bet-range is at 0.0001 - 0.0005 because we wan't to monitor everything so it goes as smooth as possible for every player.
We're going to push updates to the site continuously during the development. If you guys have any questions, new ideas or features don't hesitate to contact us at our email at: flippoker1 or write a comment below.
