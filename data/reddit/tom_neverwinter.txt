More liars in politics...
need to force politicians to cite and source materials.
same as news companies, but i would also force the full unedited use of video and audio to prevent cnn and fox news bs.

Google is telling you to go on a vacation?

if you are god with a hairdryer and nailpolish... maybe. but you would still have to defeat the public ledger of the BTC address

meh, this is what the market has always done. its not that the market is less fragile or more fragile.

Cheve unlocked; another security group has access to more junk

meh, the fbi cant keep their hands off androids and iphones. the nsa keeps hacking everything they can and leaving giant swiss cheese holes everywhere. Then there is the CIA who is exploiting certificates and signed signatures to get into more crap. The obvious issue is our "security groups" are more like Exploit whores
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:36:43
its the nsa... so... /looks at nsa's keys to the world...
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:34:34

@_date: 2017-08-15 14:27:02
github, reddit, a market site (btc-e was my goto ... but :( )

bubble, bubble.... POP! happens everytime. The main question is where will it finally stabilize again
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:22:47
stop trying to play ignorant. 
the only person who wants the malicious material on the market is the person who makes it or profits from it.
there are rules against it. however the android operating system is much more versatile and less locked down than crapples ios. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:35:34
anyone can host an app. throw your 5$ at it and upload to google play. android isnt as restrictive as ios, because we beleive in the users freedom. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:31:55
why? you install the app you want. google didn't make that wallet. 
dont like it use a different app. 
I dont use a phone for a wallet. not a very good idea.
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:52:21
dont have to use apps from the app store. side load. the app store is just convenience. 
everyone dosnt use the windows store because we remember "games for windows live" 
If you really want something, go out there and build it. I cant find what I want, so I just build it. tired of the world holding me back. get on github.

if anyone uses lucky patcher you can see every Samsung app has google ads integrated. why in the right mind would anyone want samsung to be on blockchain....

You do realize that the remaining information can easily source who this is right..... how they died when and where... and even generate their license # based on full name and the date of birth conveniently placed on that cert...

I have always wanted to peer to peer to my neighbors as "the internet" making several links on a gigabit router, and killing the middle men for the most part
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:00:14
"protect" is a general term. IN america defense is the same as offense or attack....
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:03:53
back it up? the middle east has weapons of mass destruction.... what fucking weapons of mass destruction. The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA forced trade with japan. oh you dont want to trade, look at our guns on our battleship. Wake the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:36:06
Hey that's what we said to the Japanese

@_date: 2019-05-28 18:07:51
mods should probably ban this account. its just spam/advertising.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:03:32
