Yes, I think that's wrong. I'd rather say it's the other way round: Technology is inherently political, but tech companies try to keep it apolitical. I'm thinking specifically of data and privacy issues here.

a) you can say the same thing about bitcoin in the last \~10 months :&gt; 
b) volatility is defined as price changes over a given period of time, doesn't matter whether up, or down, or up and down in quick succession

Because bitcoin is an asset, potentially a currency, but certainly not a form of governance. Same goes for the banking system actually. Bitcoin might take over some functions that are currently fulfilled by the banking system, but it will certainly not replace the banking system in the forseeable future.
The way that the headline is phrased, it implies that Bitcoin fulfills the same or similar functions as those four listed items, which it does not.

So was he inspired by all the volatility in the market and created an asset for that??

IMO there is probably something to the argument that the US military contributes to the "sucess" of the dollar. However, I wouldn't go so far and attribute all of its success to the military; there is also the largest and most innovative economy in the world backing that currency. Furthermore, this line of reasoning suggests that the US military or even government exist in large part in order to support the dollar, which is clearly not true. I very much doubt that the US military would be any smaller if the US dollar were replaced by Bitcoin.
