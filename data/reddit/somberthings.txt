Except I'm driving through mountains and going in and out of service. But thank you that sums it up perfectly!

Why would it fall apart at the saturation point? Wouldn't it just level out and stop fluctuating as much?

Thanks, I'll look into that

What exactly is the hash rate? Can you explain the significance to me? Thank you

That's what I was thinking, if it's at all possible to regulate then they will have a huge financial incentive to do so. The taxation issue alone seems like enough to make them at least try. If nothing else I could see the govt scaring people away enough to cause a significant drop

From what I've read, china doesn't have near the market share they once did. They've only got around 10% right now, meaning if they did ban it it wouldn't be too detrimental

This seems like sound logic. Thanks I'll have to look into ledgers

Do you think there's a chance that the US panics and places regulations on it? I don't see how it could even be possible considering the nature of cryptocurrencies

So all these rumors going around that they bought a large share, is this all speculative?

I understand I could google it and dig around but I'm on a long road trip and was hoping someone could sum it up for me lol
