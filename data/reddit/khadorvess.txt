I thought the futures contracts were settled in fiat not in bitcoin... so isn't his whole premise about the demise of bitcoin completely null and void.

I dont normally try catching a falling knife like this but there are some real bargains out there at the moment.

Doesn't LN mean more centralisation of the parties able to perform these transactions on the main chain e.g. will anyone be able to do this or is it going to be the exclusive reserve of some patent holder? 
Serious question as i'm trying to weed through the FUD and MUD

I think (and I'm new to all this so please bear with me) there are actual security concerns that stem from the fact that segwit2 will not include any other protocol changes to prevent replay attacks so a transaction could be taken from the segwit2 chain and replayed on the segwit chain to steal the segwit coins as well. While leaving the two compatible is great for voting / concensus it leaves a security risk that someone could steal your coins from the other chain.
Unlike bitcoin cash where there was a protocol change (a headder i think) that made the two transactions incompatible (you could not take a bitcoin cash transaction and replay it on the bitcoin network).
The contention in this stems from the fact that segwit2 is the fork and therefore core believes that they (the segwit2 team) should make the change, segwit2 believe that they will be the real chain and therefore dont want to make the change... I think... dont quote me on that though.
As i say, i'm new to all this as well but this is my understanding of the nub of the matter.

The title is a bit misleading - You only need 0.1-1 BTC in a single address to be in the top 10% of bitcoin addresses ordered by balance -  while not as snappy is more accurate.

They are more likely to start to accept / work with Etherium / something similar before Bitcoin due to features like smart contracts that don't fully exist in bitcoin (yet).

Reddit will only act if a sub is breaking the site wide policy ( which it would be hard to prove that is doing.
In general they wont just ban an entire sub, but its one of the tools in their toolbox. 
Remember just because you don't agree with someone doesn't mean you get to tell them to stop talking - that's called censorship. 
Free speech is the right to say what you want (accepting the consequences) and equally to be ignored. If you don't like what they say, please feel free to ignore that whole sub.

If only there was some technology we could use to be able to hold a record of our identity and be able to share the needed information and maybe even validate who we are using... i dont know perhaps digital signatures.
If only there was some way of storing all this information together in an immutable form that formed a ledger or record...
Oh well.

I'll give him the first bit on a local basis, but try sending money over distance and let me know its always the same. and re the inflation point - tell that to someone who lives in Zimbabwe or Venezuela. One of many assumptions and inaccuracies in this article. I'm not sure if this person is being intellectually dishonest or is just plain stupid.
