nice dude, you rock. you make me feel better about my situation.
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:32:47
thats true, the fork risks far outweigh the benefits. also 20mb is so much higher than 1, shouldnt be raised to above 4mb
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:18:20
isnt that like a nazi symbol or something? is he a nazi?
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:00:33
this is bullshit, biggest evidence is all the bitcoins were found on ross's physical laptop, so ross was the real boss. not some mod who had 2.5 btc.
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:04:27
im a disabled iraq vet, I cant work so i dont have much money. i only own .12 btc lol
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:43:26
before i can give advice, how many btc did u buy
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:16:50
I store my 0.0065 BTC on my harddrive, on my computer, and im using the bitcoin core wallet, and its encrypted. Its been there for months, untouched. 
Am i at risk of having my btc stolen? should i download armory? I am scared of stories. who lost their bitcoins from using third party wallets and such.
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:58:32
ya I think anyone fooled by doge or the idea that you could have no cap on the units of currency is just an idiot or a fool. If your not going to regulate the amount of currency, then why would you even bother? just use normal fiat. obviously everyone who believes in dogecoin, doesnt get the fucking point.
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:55:35
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:47:50
no why would I? whats better about electrum? I have heard many stories of ppl who lose their bitcoins through third party wallets and i feel like that makes me hesitant to do so.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:10:08
is there anywhere i can buy sunglasses online with bitcoin, besides overstock? specifically fake carrera's?
I want to buy some fake carrera's, which are available for 12.50 per pair on a website, but only for USD.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:07:36
agree adog
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:08:10
I do live in the usa ya. 
I also have an ipod touch that has wifi, what about that?
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:07:23
again people are too worried abuot alt coins. the market cap for all of them combined is less than btc.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:11:29
ya im in usa
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:06:36
nah I never liked dogecoin, the whole point of having a currency that the people control is so that there is a limit to the currency units. dogecoin is opposite that
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:34:32
Posting this so I remember for next monday, 
are receiving address and public key they same thing?
So if I have a bitcoin wallet, I can create many receiving address. so lets say I have 10 receiving addresses/public keys, made in my wallet. I receive 1 bitcoins into each address. So my wallet will compile all those bitcoins into 10 total, and my wallet will show 10 total. Do those people who sent me coins, do they see just 1 coin recieved @ my addresss? or can they see all 10 adresses and know that i actually have 10 btc, as opposed to just 1?
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:23:43
the fact that btc once went to 1k per coin shows that it CAN happen with the 1mb block size limit in place

point being, altcoins dont really have any traction, at all. the only one that did was litecoin, and now litecoin is just smashed
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:37:07
how do i get an invitE?
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:03:32
want the whole point of litecoin that they didnt have to use asic mining?
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:33:37
tearing down borders isnt the goal, and isnt a realistic goal. most people in the world believe in borders, the only people who dont believe in borders and the immigrants. which is a minority.
@_date: 2014-09-29 06:03:21
a big part of the reason why is there is so much greed on localbitcoins, so many of the sellers are charging a huge markup, often 15-25% and it discourages new and existing buyers from wanting to jump in. local bitcoin sellers need to drop there fees to 5% or lower if they want to see any increased demand
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:38:22
your dad is skeptical? who cares
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:32:11
Bits are better than faucet!
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:01:38
nah everyone is concerned about altcoins, they really are nothing to worry about. BTC market cap 6 billion, next closest is litecoin with 100 million. its not even close, they arent in the same league. btc will stop going south, regardless of what the altcoins do. i hope btc goes down more though so i can buy more
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:15:24
where is all the downward pressure coming from?
@_date: 2014-06-23 13:14:49
the standard bitcoin core wallet desktop
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:05:27
I Dont think btc will see a 50% drop to say, 250-300 but i welcome it because i want to buy
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:12:18
youre a bit slow if you think text posts on reddit have anything to do with the price
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:46:56
wait can u explain why that date
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:31:58
So, how do I view my private key? do you have to be a coder and know where to look, to view it?
Also can anyone send a small amount to an iraq vet? I understand many libertarians dont agree with wars, and if i knew what i know now when I was younger, I would now have signed up. here is my address
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:42:03
thanks, actually I just got the ipod and im an ipod newb, does blockchain.info, is that an online wallet ? or a downloaded wallet?
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:18:24
whoa I think I got the biggest tip, LOL thanks now i have to understand how this changetip website works. this is great because I was curious about how changetip worked
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:03:25
alot of traders know its going due for a big pull back, they are ready to sell so when the selling starts i can accelerate fast.
They have kept the bubble going for so long, could be another 2-5 years
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:04:59
what is the function of nodes compared to the function of miners?
@_date: 2015-05-03 02:30:34
thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:04:01
is there a wallet that allows transactions to be sent for absolute free?, no minimum transaction fee?
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:03:59
The reason no ones talking about this, is because it isnt a problem. The govt doesnt care about bitcoin and its small 3.5 billion dollar market cap. they dont give a shit about what list your coins are on. and even if they did, as others have said, btc is a global protocol so it wouldnt matter even if they did
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:01:52
Some people can be bought ( mike hearn ), and sure for 5 million USD you would say bitcoin sucks and sell your coins too. 
But for those of us that care about bitcoin, its here to stay. If you disagree with someone about the scaling issue, thats fine but we all are united by this need to be free from central banks controlling our currency. bitcoin is bigger than arguements and personal disagreements, and grudges. 
Its a form of money that is by the people, for the people. Even if the block size doesnt change, its still an amazing thing. even if we cant handle more than 7 transactions a second, thats fine because we can just crank up transaction fees. paying 8 cents to send 100 dollars still is alot better than western union!!!
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:46:37
cant pass that up!
@_date: 2015-08-27 05:32:06
thanks for replying atleast. i think the answer you said was no? sorry about your loss. i would recomend a password, so even if they get your private key, they need a keylogger as well.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:13:20
hey thanks! u guys rock
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:45:42
Not me, why should we be upset about people being upset @ scammers and liars?
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:37:19
Did you have a password on it? / was it encrypted?
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:42:16
yeah def this is an issue that electrum needs to sort out asap!! 
what liteweight wallets dont have this issue?
@_date: 2015-07-15 10:56:30
understood but the issue is no one posts there
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:59:50
did the recent stress tests show that no block size increase is necesarry, as the network processed all the backed up transactions within 5 days?
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:04:42
its not arbitrary its objective... the USD currency units are arbitrary. also bitcoin doesnt have many flaws, if your talking about the blocksize cap, remember it reached 10b market cap with the current blocksize cap
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:32:11
Great post, very true. really all their talk is just hot air blowing, it means nothing. They dont even like the technology, they just want to get rid of bitcoin and they think making a new bitcoin could do it. but they are wrong, and they know it too. its just posturing. Citicoin for example, will not ever compete with bitcoin because it will be centralized, and therefore doesnt offer the same thing bitcoin does. same with ripple, which is why ripple sucks.
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:45:06
cool do you cash out only thru bank transfers?
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:33:29
actually it is competing with all of those, it takes 291 US currency units to equal 1 BTC currency unit. id say thats competitive.
I guess youre another person who thinks libertarianism is dangerous, right?
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:30:50
a "lottery" lol
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:27:10
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:00:06
nows a good time, its unlikely to go under 200 and the bottom is 180. probably going up
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:33:22
whats wrong with local btc?
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:29:08
that really is unfortunate. Id find a different wallet that allowed to encrypt/password.
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:20:37

Most of them actually own atleast some bitcoin, which makes them bigger supporters of the technology than the average person who owns none.
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:52:06
who cares, it doesnt matter. sorry for your loss is a dead subreddit.
Buttcoiners, many of them own atleast some amount of bitcoin, which makes them bigger supporters than the average person. 
They are too poor to affect the price anyway, they dont matter
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:08:54
hey i could use some tips to send other ppl some tips plz
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:43:55
hey can i have a tip please?
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:46:45
are your receiving addresses a checksum or hash or somehow a deritative of your public address?
