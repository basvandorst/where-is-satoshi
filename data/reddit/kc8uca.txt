Bitcoin night trading here in Tokyo has kept me out of the karaoke bars. Now I just Forever Alone with a rum and coke and toss around digital hashes and dollars.

There we go. Now it's starting to function like a real economy!

Could they have stolen an early adopter's wallet?

I just mean, in sheer numbers of 'experts', the ratio of pro:con climate change is similar to Keynes:Austrian. I'm making a quantitative comparison, not a qualitative one. 
I'm sure would love to debate the quality of the positions, unless one goes in there with a "super bad-ass AnCap" grating attitude.

Read Hitchhikers Guide. It's certainly possible.

Sorry for the snap, I'm used to being used as target practice for people that are "more AnCap than thou".  
Woot for tech!  I actually use it as a part of my commodities portfolio to diversify.

Aww, you're cute. I am a us citizen, but am actually in the military (jackbooted government thug, amirite????). I don't make a crazy amount of cash, but am thankful that I live in 2013 with managed fiat currency, public infrastructure,  and safe food.  Sure beats the gilded age boom-bust.   This firstworldproblem recession has been oh so tough compared to those days. 
I bet you were pissed when your parents didn't take you seriously in the marketplace of ideas that is debating cleaning your room. They must have been LITERALLY OBAMA. :'(

Correct, sans sarcasm. Austrian Econ theory has failed on its own merits. I understand you don't agree with that, just as a creationist would disagree with an 'academia echo chamber' like biology. And even the Koch funded climate scientist is backtracking on his denialism. 
You guys wonder why reddit is turned off of bitcoin. I'd propose its the constant "I'm more AnCap than you", conspiracy theorist pissing contests.
Again, I am pro bitcoin. The community does itself no favors to demonize pro-state users, because face it...  There are more of us.

I'm not wading into a anti-fed, tyranny, hur dur liberty, back and forth. 
Both rely on a large number of untrustworthy third parties and widespread faith in the system.   General statement, general response. 
Simple as that.  I'm not going into the politics or mantra of either system.

The entire idea behind Litecoin is that it isn't iteration computationally bound.  How would a ASIC defeat the massive amount of memory needed?
Gonna brute force it?

Hear, hear.  Let's celebrate on the Silk Road. First one's on me.

I've used SpinRite to great success.  I'm glad that site was able to compile a dozen pages that have a beef with him.  If I was incorrect that many times in a period ending in 2010, I'd consider it a net gain.
He doesn't have a beef with BTC, he just points out the absurdity of a ASIC hash arms race that pushes out the very distributive nature that a decentralized currency needs.

Almost sounds like mining. 
@_date: 2013-01-27 06:01:10
It's not about SHA2 at this point, it's about defeating the hash rate 'arms race' that has infected BTC.
I'd rather my digital commodity be secured by a paralleled function that isn't easily burned into an ASIC, and actually required memory real estate that isn't as easy to scale.

Works great for me. I live a very easy life, historically speaking.  No complaints.

I'm a Keynesian Statist, and I like Bitcoin.  Only for transaction and storage anonymity, though. I can see why doesn't want to see it, but seems strange. 
I think they are lumping it in with the austrian/paulspam, because BTC is attractive to those of that mindset.   Like it or not, being an Austrian is like being a climate change denier in mainstream economics.
@_date: 2013-01-30 03:21:58
I was going for quantity of argument, not necessarily quality. Climate denier climatologists are a fringe minority in their field, much like Austrians.
