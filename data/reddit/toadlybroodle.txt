I like idea of introducing 100satoshi denomination, but don't think it should be called a 'bit' as this is confusing on two levels: 1) it already denotes a unit of data 2) it doesn't comply with SI standard usage which is the 'microbit'.
Should call a microbit a 'decent' - decentralized cent.

Oh, they touched on cash in the hearing also:
Mr. Charles Davidson
([2:00:50]( 
"If I may just throw in, very briefly, my little afterthought about cash...We're talking about huge sums of cash being processed...this is probably not something that can be addressed in this bill, it's not in the anonymous company legislation. But I think that we have to deal with that at some point. John held up a $100 bill note, what about the 500 note? Except maybe to displace the $100 bill as a way of engaging in illicit financial activities of various sorts. So I think that would be something to think about going down the pipe, but it's outside this purvey."

If you read the article, you'd realize this is irrelevant as Andreas Antonopoulos points out, increased mining is not required for increased capacity; what we have is enough. Plus the Lightning Network!

This type of censorship is not possible in a decentralized consensus system such as the Bitcoin blockchain. And if it were, it would undermine all that Bitcoin is.

You're correct that the analysis was done 3 years ago, but where are you getting the 0.8% from? 
2014 energy consumption: [707,120,500kWh](
Dec 2017 energy consumption: [32.56TWh](
2014 consumption relative to 2017: 0.70712/32.56=0.0217~=2.2%
So, the energy consumption from bitcoin mining has increased ~46x (1/0.0217) over the past 3 years.
2017 Bitcoin CO2 emissions relative to banking industy's: [0.002](
Assuming the banking industry hasn't grown during this time, and assuming mining has not since increased in efficiency or moved towards renewable energy sources (both of which it has done), currently Bitcoin mining CO2 emissions would still only be 9.2% that of the banking industry.

[Tone Vayes comment]( regarding Davidson's stating ([2:00:50]( €500 and $100 bill are _only_ used for criminal activity:


@_date: 2017-12-01 23:58:41
The bill "criminalizes Intentional concealment of ownership or control of a [digital currency/exchange] account." Aka, you are automatically a criminal if you don't abide by KYC laws. As Tone Vayes commented, how are they going to enforce it? How did the US Government's prohibition and war on drugs turn out for them?

Tax-free exposure to Bitcoin gains is a really great step.
Hopefully, Canadian banks can further improve their acceptance of Bitcoin. It might be nice to start with NOT locking out accounts found transacting with crypto-currencies.
This would help incentivize Canadians to invest in Bitcoin. Of course, any real investor in Bitcoin holds their own keys, rather than just trusting some bankster.

Starting out with a small amount is advisable so you learn how to use the protocol and apps without the risk of losing too much capital. Once you're comfortable with storing/sending/receiving btc, then start buying more volume.

Not in the case of one-off atomic swaps: because both users will need to commit funds to a 'funding transaction' on both chains. So this actually incurs twice as many fees. These funding transactions must be on-chain to secure the safety of both users, and thus incur miner fees. 
However, that's where the Lightning Network comes in. The LN sets up 'channels' between users, aka reuses the initial 'funding transactions' over and over between users. So once the channel is set up between users, only Lightning Network fees are charged on these 'off-chain' transactions within the channel. The LN promises much cheaper fees, because LN clients can choose to use channels with the lowest fees, which sets up a supply and demand free-market fee system.
If users want to pay less in fees, they can certainly choose to transact on the cheapest blockchain, as always. The power of the LN is it enables long-lived off-chain transaction channels, so users don't have to transact on any blockchain (within channels). The power of atomic swaps is that they eliminate the need for a middle-man exchange when users wish to trade one currency for another. This will certainly make it much easier and cheaper to trade between cryptocurrencies, but fees will still be incurred on cross-chain transactions. These fees will likely end up being higher than same-chain transactions, because the cross-chain nodes will have to open funding transactions on both chains, i.e. must fund twice as much coin upfront.
tl;dr - LN allows off-chain transaction channels, atomic swaps eliminate need for middle-man cryptocurrency exchanges. By combining the two, cross-chain transactions will certainly become cheaper but will likely remain more expensive than same-chain transactions.

US government worried cryptocurrencies could undermine USD; Congress asking the right questions to the wrong people.
 - The US government is worried cryptocurrencies may threaten to undermine their strangle hold over the world.
 - At least some in congress appear to be asking the right questions—but likely to the wrong people.
 - Much confusion, many misinformation, such b.s.
  - To be fair, Garratt and Michel, in particular, did put forth some solid facts—however misguided their agendas.
 - Mr. Garratt and Mr. Prasad: "Blockchain, not Bitcoin!"
 - Mr. Michel is extremely naive if he thinks the US will allow fair competition to their world reserve currency.
 - Brad Sherman is a paid bank shill, FUD-monger; and Mr. Pollock is his whipping boy.

Of course I have, and it also makes reference to "routine escrow mechanisms". That's what this app is. The trusted third parties that the white paper was referring to, as I read it, are centralized governing institutions such as banks. Bit Khajiit is merely a Bitcoin service.
