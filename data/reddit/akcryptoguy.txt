I prefer the Dodge Challenger to the Lamborghini but does it really matter since I don't own either?

What in God's name does that have to do with buying the dip?

I recommend that if you can, always buy in thirds instead of opening your whole position at once. 
"Hey, today looks like a good day to buy and I have some money." - spend 1/3 of your available money to buy the asset. If you still feel good about it a day (or a few days later), buy the second third. Wait a week to see if the market confirms your optimism, and if you still feel good about the position, finish buying your final third. If the asset is in a downward trend, wait until momentum has slowed before you buy again.

Not at all.
I am saying to avoid making rash investing decisions because all too often, if you do it that way, you will let your emotions override rational decision making. If you can avoid the "all or nothing" mentality that comes with opening or closing your long positions in a single transaction, and spread them out over a period of time which usually leads to better outcomes.
Take Billy, who sold his house in November 2017 and put all of his proceeds into Bitcoin in December of that year. If he had listened to the hype and said "Hey-- Bitcoin sounds like the future! I'm going to invest $200,000 in Bitcoin" and then bought it all at once he would likely have gotten burned so badly he'd never come back and his wife would have left him. If he had bought 1/3 of that position in December at the high and then waited a bit for the market to finish collapsing and bought another third in January or February and then waited until a few months later to buy the final third, he'd probably be a lot more happy. Or even he might have gotten burned so badly with the first $70k that he never would have made the second two purchases. The point is just to slow down.

No, you should not do that because that would be dumb.

If you hand them a $5 bill and ask for change, and they give you change, it was probably not a scam. If you ask for change and they take your money and run away, then it was most likely a scam.

I disagree. I'm not going to change the way that I invest just because they're the ones who suck.

Maybe if he were the Winklevoss twins with billions but with $15,000 I think this is bad advice and making a relatively easy thing unnecessarily complex. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. You wouldn't tell the guy with $15,000 to put it in 5 different banks.

Why make it more difficult than it needs to be and spread it out over 4 or 5 different seeds across 4 or 5 different Ledgers?  How would this give better security than one seed and one Ledger, sufficiently and securely backed up?

This brings great joy to my heart.

Don't forget bottlecaps.  To survive the apocalypse, you'll need a good number of bottlecaps.

I am pleased to hear this coming from the man who taught me that the meaning of life is 42. No less true now than then.

It isn't that your wallet backups are converted to video files; it's that you told your computer to \*think\* that .dat files are video files.  Just remove the file association. Only use the methods involving Windows settings-- do not download any third party tools.

Wasn't getting too nervous just wondering if I feel like trying to catch the falling knife.  I didn't think anything fundamentally had changed.  It's not like Congress is on fire or anything.

Oh wow now a huge upswing.  Looks like somebody triggered a flash crash that is quickly righting itself.

Sell sell sell!  $28k is a good price.  Hope to see that by December.
