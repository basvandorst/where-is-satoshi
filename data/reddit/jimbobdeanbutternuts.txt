Dont go all in at once. Buy in intervals so if it goes down u get an avg.
You should use a hardware wallet. Ledger is sold out. Order a trezor.
Start buying BTC ETH or LTC. I recommend LTC because it will be faster. Transfer ltc to gdax then to your trezor.
Fastest and safest onramp in my opinion.
Thank me later.

Safer than a mobile. I guess if you have no choice. Bittrex poloniex binance etc
Go through coinmarketcap and see what u like. Now is the time to find the diamonds in the dirt.

And back up your 2 factor authentication keys.

Yes that is correct. Ledger is sold out until march so trezor...but get on the buy list for ledger if possible because they support more altcoins than trezor.
I hope you get the cash on your usd wallet quickly, it is insured. The cash transfers take a while so you need to get on that asap.
When I bought in I went with eth ltc and btc but basically btc is what you need to trade into other alts, which is where you will get your most profit. Use ltc to transfer to and from exchanges, then trade into btc for your alts.
This will also benefit you because btc is the only crypto that you can track historically with minute by minute candlesticks. This is important for taxes.
Anyway, make sure you keep track of your history and stuff for taxes.

Also, be sure to go ahead and make accounts on all the exchanges you want and use 2 factor authentication. When things get heavy registration closes, so it is best to be prepared ahead of time.
