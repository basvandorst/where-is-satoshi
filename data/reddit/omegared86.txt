It ends up being somewhat successful until Charlie destroys the hardrives they used to store the cryptocurrency. 
Wild card bitches!

That right there is the bitcoin. Now let's talk about the bitcoin. Can we talk about the bitcoin, please, Mac? I've been dying to talk about the bitcoin with you all day, OK? "Satoshi Nakamoto" this name keeps coming up over and over again. Every day bitcoin is getting sent back to me from Satoshi. 
So I say to myself, "I gotta find this guy!" What do I find out?! There is no Satoshi Nakamoto. The man does not exist, okay? So I decide, "Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper." There's no Satoshi Nakamoto? 
You gotta be kidding me! I got hard drives full of bitcoin! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to Mark Karpelèsl  at Mt Gox and I knock on his door and I say, "Markl! Markl! I gotta talk to you about Satoshi Nakamoto." And when I open the door what do I find? There's not a single goddamn desk in that office! There...is...no..Mt Gox . Mac, half the bitcon users have been made up. This currency is a goddamn ghost town.

I've been kicking myself everyday. I purchased $500 worth of bitcoin in 2014, I ended up with 1 bitcoin.  In 2015 I desperately needed money, so in a panic I sold most of my bitcoin at a loss, 1 coin was worth $280 at the time. Anyway I currently own a measly .1316 coins, and I kicking myself every day for being dumb.
