Just keep your hardware wallet in a safe deposit box or at some other location than your home. Then you can't transfer it unless you go to that location.

lol, what? I think you just said I'm wrong and then linked to proof of my claim:
"Q.  Is a merchant allowed to add a surcharge to the purchase amount for using a Visa card?
A.  In general, no. "

I never said that credit cards are running a charity, I said that the customer doesn't pay a fee (the merchant does). Most credit cards give a points or cash back bonus for using them. Businesses are not allowed to charge a fee to customers using Visa or MC, it's against the terms of service agreement.
I agree that a discount for buying with BTC could help. The market is going to decide what an acceptable fee is.

I'm no BCash shill, but it is all relative. $2 transactions are way better than $20 transactions, but it's not better than $.2 transactions.
And if we're looking for adoption, the current average joe pays nothing for a credit card transaction (except perhaps in a general raise in the price of things), so anything more than $0 is going to be seen as a negative.

Sure, we can agree that value is subjective, but it's not as simple as saying it's whatever you want it to be. I'm taking the value that we currently assign within the global economy and asking how much of it will be stored in cryptocurrency. With that premise in place, we can be methodological in figuring out a realistic range so that we're not just shooting in the dark.

Ultimately, I realized I can afford to lose everything. All in!

Can confirm it works. Tried it last night.

We're still in the forming/storming phase of Tuckman's stages. This might be the year where we finally start to norm and perform. Let's do it!
