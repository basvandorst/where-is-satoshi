I honestly think everyone enjoys your content and delivery, or there wouldn't be so many requests for you to do a video on it. However, this is the internet with many opinions, I'm sure would give many suggestions. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:41:50
Congrats sir. Just think the world population is 7,000,000,000. The possible amount of bitcoin to ever exist is 21,000,000. If, or when, it becomes mainstream you better get your moon boots ready. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:34:36
I think it's more a testament to how exciting things have been in the last couple weeks. Any little lull in the action feels like time slowing down. Let's get back to orbit please.

@_date: 2014-06-02 17:15:30
There's a website where you can send an email to anyone using the name of any truly existing account. I've used it before, and it's very scary because it's 100% legitimate looking when you see it in your inbox. Don't trust ANY email. 
Funny enough, the website I'm talking about accepts Bitcoin donations to stay funded. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:36:08
Sell it. Buy more Bitcoin. Profit. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:41:10
I was wondering about this because Reeds comes up most frequently near me on coinmap.org. There's tons of them on that website. Always made me wonder if they are actually accepting it in store (would require their many employees to be knowledgable on bitcoin) or online only. 
 
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:20:25
My good friend has set up coinbase with his bank account. So to be lazy I get him to send me BTC and pay him back later. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:48:37
I don't see it, but I'm using AdBlock Plus.. just another reason to use an ad blocking extension. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:49:59
Everyone please, use ad-blocking extensions. I use Adblock Plus, but there are many others. 
If you use Adblock Plus, please go to "Filter preferences" and then at the bottom uncheck "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" which still allows Google ads which often contain phishing sites (most notably Blockchain.info a few weeks ago). 
Stay safe.

Wouldn't using 2FA SMS negate anything they could do? Of course if you were silly enough to register and use 2FA with the same email that would be an issue but..
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:13:05
I agree. Clearly not a native English speaker. The whole ploy is to spoof an email and say "send your bitcoins here".

Say someone makes a good YouTube video that you enjoy, or someone on twitter posts an interesting tweet, you simply say thank you and tip them like you would here on Reddit. If they do not claim the tip (thereby activating their very own ChangeTip wallet) within 7 days, ChangeTip refunds it to your account. No real risk to you. 
It's not about trying to receive tips, it's about people who want to get the community interested tipping others. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:07:16
You link your changetip account with your Reddit account with one click. Then you can send your funds to your wallet at any time.

Glad you posted. I don't think it's necessarily all or nothing either. I wish it was. I would love to see a collapse of fiat with an overtaking of bitcoin, but we all know it probably won't happen in this fashion. I have a small amount of bitcoin in a hedgefund, and I add to it with every paycheck. I believe in it. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 04:13:04
I hate the crypto-wars at a time like this. Yeah, I only own Bitcoin, I'm a BTC fanboy for sure, but why not come together on an important issue like this? Thanks OP for the post and support. We can all go back to making fun of each other once the NYC Bitlicense is taken care of.

Paging @_date: 2014-07-15 19:15:46
For a company that was supposedly hesitant to implement Bitcoin, they seem pretty sure of themselves now. Someone certainly caught the BTC fever. And the only prescription, is more BTC.

Most honest answer I can give: No. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:30:22

Sounds interesting. I'll try for it. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:59:56
So Silk Road + DPR seized coins add up to over 173,000 btc. If all dumped, do you consider this to be a good or bad thing? Publicly it would look very bad, and possibly slow adoption (especially if a crash hurts the new big bitcoin players). Or do you think it would be a good thing on an individual basis (i.e. you would buy a considerable amount after a crash)?
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:49:07

6. Never following links in emails and always manually checking the URLs of the websites you login to. 
Many more tips, but just these can seriously help security.

@_date: 2014-07-17 03:42:04
I think that giving out bitcoin (small amounts) to others on YouTube, Twitter, Reddit (probably non r/bitcoin'ers), Facebook (beta should release soon) via ChangeTip can get people interested.
I don't know if you watch a lot of YouTube or have favorite channels but many people do YouTube full time. Some of them have millions of followers. They rely mainly on YouTube advertisements and donations to make their living. I have been trying to tip a few via ChangeTip and see if they accept it. 
If people are given a small amount of it, they may realize how easy it is and become interested. In the case of YouTubers this could potentially be relayed to millions of followers. "Hey guys you can always donate bitcoin at X address or donate via ChangeTip" - causing viewers to subsequently become interested. 
I'm no spokesperson for ChangeTip, I just find it convenient. Any way that you want to give micro-payments would be a positive thing. The friend that eventually got me into Bitcoin started my interest by helping me make a wallet and sending me $10. That 10$ is what would lead me to become interested. When you feel apart of something you become more interested. 
TL;DR: Disbursement of funds to people through social media could capture the interests of the masses. Micro-payments are a really interesting thing. ChangeTip works on many social media venues. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:48:25

Or there's room in the definition of what "technical" means. If it's the basic concepts most people can ramble through it. If it's physically being able to write out and explain the code, very little people understand. If it's somewhere in the middle it should be defined or given a "somewhat" answer. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 03:46:38

I honestly appreciate the update and what you have done personally for the community. As a university student myself, I wish we had such initiatives. As one previous comment states, the young people are the future of Bitcoin. I'm glad to be apart of this community and this movement and genuinely excited for the years ahead.

You have the bank roll to take care of this problem right? 
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:26:45
So does this (or should this) phenomenon affect the way we buy Bitcoin? As in do you not buy in anymore than you already have until another serious market drop? I know that in the long run, if Bitcoin catches on it won't matter because the price should still be significantly higher than where we bought in, but I still think it's a valid question. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:22:55

Bitcoin shouldn't generally be a short term investment. HODL those coins. In no time at all it will bounce back. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:05:50
I could deal with that.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:52:39
From what I've read here, the viability/profitability of mining for the typical lay-person is near zero. 
Makes me wonder if the only way to be in the black when it comes to mining is being apart of the companies who sell them. It makes sense if they get to "test" out new technology before anyone else and when they raise the difficulty they sell the less-than-profitable machines and create new, faster machines. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:09:28
Please God show me where these $10 bitcoins are. I'll gladly buy.

Very jelly. What's been the hardest part?
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:04:03
This scenario is highly unlikely. Most keylogging softwares send updates via email with keystrokes and screenshots every X amount of minutes (usually no less than 30 would be used by an attacker). This senario in which 2FA would be compromised would only happen if your PC was infected with a RAT which has live monitoring. In which case it would be more obvious to even a lay-man to know their computer was compromised. Either way either of these things happen with poor internet/PC security. 
In my opinion if people are that paranoid about being compromised, buy a new machine or reformat an old machine. Only use it for bitcoin purposes. Keep it disconnected from the internet at all times, except to do transactions. Access your wallet securely (i.e. keeping the wallet as your home screen or using something like blockchain.info's browser extension) anything to eliminate user error. 
When connecting to the internet briefly to make a transaction, use SSL everywhere. Use adblocking extensions. Your account should be 2FA SMS and use TWO strong passwords  (one for the account, and one to transfer funds). Never use this machine to browse the internet or ever use this machine on a public connection. 
Yeah it's unnecessary, but seeing as people are paranoid as hell...

Go to "Filter preferences" and turn off "allow minimally intrusive ads".

This is actually good news. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:08:47
That's the one! Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:02:03
Yes all confirmed except Facebook (I don't think beta has released yet). I think it can become a trend on twitter and YouTube. Nothing sparks interest like people giving people money. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 06:22:48
Until that person sold.

I don't ever mess with alt-coins, but I' curious if putting a little BTC in LTC would result in a quick buck since there should be a rebound.. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:04:22
Good long term investment. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:09:08
Certainly enough positive news in the last week to get us started.

We're the high class crytpo's. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:30:30
Awesome. You should make that a changetip short. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 07:46:53
Go away.

Half a bitcoin? Good lord. Have you tried getting a job yet? I was working at 15 scrubbing dishes. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:46:07
That's a lot of tips to give out. You're a good man. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:53:47
Nice. I hope I can eventually invest enough to get 3BTC (serious). 100 bits
@_date: 2014-07-23 23:14:52
Not trying to be rude or anything but some guy made this thread a couple days ago. 
Edit. Here:

This is actually good news. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:48:33
Wow this is such an exciting time for bitcoin. Glad to be apart of it.

They also posted on Facebook to their 1,400,000+ follwers.
Unfortunately much of the feedback there looks negative. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:44:09
Great read. Thanks for posting. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:51:02
IMO it will take adoption. For instance, if Wal-Mart and major gas companies accept bitcoin, no one will say "what's that?" or "stay away from that stuff!", well they might if they're a butt-hurt naysayer. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:11:01
I hope he's right. I would buy so many 10$ bitcoin it would be incredible. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:26:52
1,400,000+ person exposure. I'll take it.

"Oh bitcoin? It's an online decentralized deflationary cryptoconcurrency. If you love freedom, apple pie and Jesus you better do some research." 
@_date: 2014-06-05 05:26:34
Okay, more for me then. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:45:02
That's ridiculous. Bitcoin is so far ahead of the game. As soon as more people realize this.. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:16:11
Good luck, I hope all goes well! Excited with all the news today. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:06:33
CEO of Western Union said they will never use Bitcoin.

I'm sorry what's it say? Hard to read with my space helmet on.
