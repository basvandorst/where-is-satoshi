I'm pretty sure there are decentralized exchanges where you can invest in BTC related startups. Thing is I think most of them are very new and entirely unproven startups. Did you see the maidsafe sale through Mastercoin? Here is an article on Forbes about it
I think the price of bitcoin will rise faster than any one startup, but the only reason it will go up is because of the efforts of the people promoting bitcoin and making it easier to use through their companies. 
As someone who owns bitcoin and working on a btc related startup, I'm not to concerned if I don't earn anymore bitcoin in my life. I want to contribute to the ecosystem to get more people involved so more liquidity is put into bitcoin so those holding bitcoin will see them appreciate. It's not that I don't want bitcoin, I just see more potential from people not yet involved in the currency, then taking from those that already own bitcoin.

Nicolas and his company is a great example! I just started working on a bitcoin related project as well, but it seems Nicolas travels all over the world promoting bitcoin and blockchain.info. Can't imagine what he spends on plane tickets and accommodation when traveling. 
Strictly speaking about what is more profitable, it seems sitting on your bitcoins at home and not spending them would be more profitable. I just wonder how anyone can run a profitable bitcoin company when it seems in the long run you'll profit more simply by not spending them? I'm so paranoid about spending them then it going up in value the next day. As someone who owns bitcoin I'm glad to see so many hard working entrepreneurs bringing the currency to the mainstream and hope I can play a small role as well.

So not many cared when Ross Ulbricht got arrested, but Charlie is one of our own and he has done so much for the bitcoin community. I'm wondering what is the bitcoin community going to do to get him out? How will we make sure he doesn't do any time in prison?? 
People are so proud to identify themselves with their national identities, but although I was born within what we consider the U.S. border I don't identify myself with these goons that arrested Charlie. FBI, NSA, Homeland Security, DEA.... We do not elect the people that head these organizations and are not given a choice whether we want to continue funding their operations.
I don't need the United States federal govt and its bureaucratic organizations to live a happy and productive life. How bad does it have to get for people to realize we are sovereign citizens and at what point do we stop associating ourselves with our federal govts and stand up for the good people they are arresting??

I believe people will begin to create their own governments and individuals will be able to choose which societies/govts they want to take part in as opposed to automatically being forced to be a citizen because of the geographic location of where they were born. 
Bitcoin may be a part of this or it may be the next generation of decentralized technologies. Paypal deals with current govt backed currencies so they wont be part of the revolution.

Nobody is fighting. IRS can't even return phone calls of people who have questions using their own currency, much less get involved with stateless digital currency.
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:42:39
It's sad because these people getting their money seized are often senior citizens. It's better to hold bitcoin because they may claim you owe them money and you will at least be notified before any attempts are made to force you to pay. If you are holding a govt backed currency, they can take it from your account, then ask questions later as mentioned in the post.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:39:14

Again, I don't have to renounce anything or move anywhere. I define myself how I like and not how a central authority thousands of miles away defines me. I will pay the minimal amount of taxes that the men with guns say I have to pay as I am a realist about our current situation.
As for taking advantage of things paid for by the federal govt, I have no interest in any of it. They shouldn't be involved in education, healthcare, wars on other side of world, spying on the entire world, etc. Everything I need is well managed by local govt.

We need strong local/municipal govt to take care of issues such as garbage and police. I have more in common with many individuals in Iran who prefers limited govt than people in the U.S. who want govt involved in everything. We shouldn't have to move to the other side of the world if we don't want to participate in our federal govt and we should be able to choose which societies we want to be a part of.

Long debate that neither one will convince the other of, so no point in trying. We need more choice in govt though. Just because you were born in a certain geographic location doesn't mean a govt gets the right to claim you for life and you have to live within those regulations.

You don't know how the fiat, debt based financial system works. I'll bet you have even less considering the debt you have on your house, car, credit card or anything else. The large majority of people are in the negative, because that's how fiat money is created and distributed. It starts off as debt so mathematically it's impossible for most people to have any cash when factoring in debt.

The whole BTC community needs to make it a habit to print several wallets from bitaddress and hand it out to people asking for money on the streets.

I can't help but think that in the very near future the equivalent of our federal governments will be created online and we can join and leave these governments as we wish. People of many nationalities will actually live in the same city. If we can create our currencies online we should be able to create our governments online. 
We will be able to decide what currencies we want to use, the level of social benefits and protections that we want from govt. Federal govts don't provide any services that are needed for people in a geographic location rather "social services" such as medical, social security etc. 
We need to strengthen municipal govts to protect us from our federal govts and allow us to opt out of our national citizenships.  I mentioned it in a previous post in r/bitcoin but got downvoted by those dependent on federal govt

The U.S. government is actually keeping the price of BTC high by not selling. I think the next huge rise in BTC is going to be from these types of seizures and from institutional investors and governments buying BTC. Now that they have seen that they can't shut it down, they will do what they can to get their hands on as much as possible.
I would actually prefer the U.S. govt sold their of BTC even if legitimate holders of BTC see the price temporarily drop.

Hey bitc0ins!
Cool! Crazy how some people know how to code/program but don't know what to build and some think of many useful applications but don't know how to code.
Musicians, authors and movie producers need to be able to sell their content online for bitcoins or any alt digital currency of their choice. Would love to work on this with you or you can just do it yourself if you like. I can't code yet but learning very soon.
Where do you live? I spend my time time in Austin and NYC

That's what I would like to build  Know how to do this or someone that does?
As I said above, I'd be interested in taking on a cofounder or paying a developer to create this.

The r/bitcoin community is the most helpful place and people will answer any questions you have.

Not true. People around the world meet in person to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency. It happens every week in NYC at Union Square.

Got it! Thanks!! I currently just have one address and private key because it's just the bitcoin that I originally bought and haven't moved it.

I look forward to using it also. Hopefully this post inspires someone to create this. As I mentioned I'm not a tech guy, but trying to learn quickly. 
I'd be willing to work with a business partner that could create this or paying a developer to create it as well.
