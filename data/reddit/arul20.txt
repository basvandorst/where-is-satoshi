Florida developed initially due to Columbian cocaine.
Las Vegas was initially developed by the mafia.
Sleaze and crime may kick things off and help growth but over time as normal people come on board, the scene becomes "gentrified".

Why do they prefer to have many white label exchanges in their network rather than be a single, strong exchange themselves? I'm not seeing how it makes for a better business model or stronger currency network. They have the money to set up their own strong exchange, and it might not be worth it to take some level of responsibility for all the numerous exchanges under their network.

I don't know, that's why I'm asking right?
One thing I'm thinking is that, giving such a broad access to banks and other global organisations could very quickly swamp the existing btc ecosystem and community. 
Another thing is that AlphaPoint will be the next MtGox like entity that's the central point of entry for all these organisations. Is that another MtGox disaster waiting to happen?

Exactly, single point of failure - just like Mt Gox. Defeating the point of a distributed system and destroying the public's faith in it.

What about timelines? Say it takes 10 years to prove something .. and it couldn't be proven in time because of that?

Hey dude - you might see your overall value plummet to 25k as the price goes to 2.5K. But if you hold, and maybe buy further - eventually the recovery will make it all worth it. Just heads up that more sinking is near.
