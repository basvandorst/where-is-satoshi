once the man on the street loses everything, and I mean E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G during the next financial crises banking wipeout he'll no longer trust banks and maybe he'll decide to take a few hours, sit down, and figure this whole bitcoin thing out.  (he'll have plenty of time).  I didn't know jack about securing anything digital, but I don't trust banks enough to sit down and hash it out and learn.

@_date: 2018-01-02 22:50:49
right, they have to implement something that does the exact same thing segwit does they just won't call it segwit.

They don't exist and they may be impossible therefore in order to ensure decentralization of the network nodes must be able to be run easily on consumer grade hardware.

Just PM'd you, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:09:05
and if hashpower stays with the un-upgraded nodes then that chain continues independent. Which would only happen with a contentious fork. Consensus is a super-majority that agrees or can at least live with the change.  Bitcoin has had several hard forks in the past, each time only one chain continued on. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:13:13
no they don't need segwit, just something that does the same thing as segwit that they'll never call segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:01:47
I cant believe coinbase and gemini dont batch wtf
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:43:01
It's a failure of consensus. So some people refuse to upgrade and keep the non-forked chain alive, making two chains. If it's a tiny minority of people then it's probably not a problem but if it's a sizable amount then it can cause a lot of problems and confusion.  If it has consensus then everyone agrees so they just upgrade at the same time so there wouldn't be any split.  A hardfork changes the coin, a contentious hardfork creates a split thus you're left with two coins.

Just stop using them, their service is a ripoff anyway. Use Bitflyer. They batch, use segwit, let you choose a priority or not withdrawal fee and are overall much cheaper than coinbase. More bitcoin for the same dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:19:37
Bitflyer is way better, get more bitcoin for the same amount of dollar. Coinbase is a ripoff.

I love AA, but he's wrong here. There are plenty transactions that serve no other purpose other than to take up space, sent from addresses like this one:

Don't count on it, just stop using coinbase, Other exchanges like Gemini and Bitflyer are cheaper anyway. I really like bitflyer, more bitcoin for less dollar even after accounting for the wire fee.  Plus they batch AND use segwit.

thousands of blocks with millions of coins were brought into existence instantly without any work by miners. Only the post-fork blocks were mined. Calling it a pre-mine is pretty accurate. Only difference is this pre-mine benefits all holders instead of just the creators of the alt.

I've been waiting to get verified on gemini for weeks, so I wouldn't know. I've heard it's good though, they still need to implement batching and segwit like coinbase though.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:15:42
Bitflyer had me verified in 24 hours and it's way cheaper than coinbase, coinbase is a ripoff! Plus bitflyer uses segwit and they batch transactions AND they let you choose fee options for withdrawal.  They are excellent stewards of the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:55:25
It's mind blowing to me that these companies wanted segwit  and a block size doubling to "save on fees" yet they don't EVEN BATCH TRANSACTIONS.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:29:35
you think the bandwidth requirements are bad for a segwit enabled 1mb coin like bitcoin? Congrats now you know why raising the blocksize is a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:50:42
cheaper fees? Coinbase is by far the most expensive place to buy bitcoin besides probably localbitcoins.  I bought $15k worth of bitcoin on bitflyer and even accounting for the wire and withdrawal fee it cost me $200 less than it would have on coinbase. My wire was credited the same day too, able to withdraw the coins same day I bought them.  Plus they batch and use segwit. Much better stewards of the blockchain. Coinbase DGAF, all they care about is collecting their fee and they'll list plenty of alts just for that.

So just freeload off of core? This is why they wanted a block size increase, it requires no work on their end. Segwit does. Companies try to cost cut everywhere so why not free load off the bitcoin network and developers eh? Great short term business strategy but horrible long term one.

The man is a liar, he refuses to retract his lies. He pals around with Roger Ver and Fake Satoshi.  This is propaganda to convince people it's not safe so they can follow it up with "bitcoin isn't safe anymore, bitcoin cash is cuz no segwit!".
points in the video:
1. There are no coins. Bitcoins don't exist. You are changing numbers in a ledger. Segwit is a way to do it that uses less space in a block. Multi-sig addresses are more secure but use more space in a block, are multi-sig addresses not bitcoin?
2. COMPLETELY FALSE. I can't believe anyone could claim this with a straight face. Segwit addresses cannot be used or manipulated in any way without a valid signature from the owner. The signature is just moved to a different part of the hash. It's called segregated witness, NOT removed witness.
3. See 
4. techno-babble. see 
5. A signature is still required for segwit transactions, same security model.
go ahead and try to move coins in a segwit address without a valid signature, There are millions of dollars worth in segwit addresses now. I'll wait.


off the top of my head the biggest one I can think of that causes a lot of confusion is 1 cpu 1 vote. Nodes and miners used to be the same thing, the full node core client used to include mining built in, once mining became super competitive and mining pools showed up mining with your own CPU was useless so this changed and full Nodes became what enforced protocol rules and mining secures the network. Nodes are the proof in "proof of work" and mining is the work.

no they can't change software, they don't write code. If they could control bitcoin they would.  They do control BCASH though because no one bothers to run BCASH nodes but the miners themselves, so they control the entire network.
There is nothing "devious" about a soft fork. Quite the opposite, It is backwards compatible.  it doesn't break all current software requiring an immediate upgrade from everyone at the exact same time.
If you think miners were dumb enough to think corporate CEO's would be able to deliver on a promise to raise the block size then I have a far higher opinion of miners than you do. 
They are not stupid, Bitmain played their hand and pushed this stupid narrative you're parroting, and once they realized no one was falling for it they reversed direction in order to save face.  
In an alternate universe where you are right S2X went through because it had 95% hash power support because that's all that matters.

very low chance of that happening. People just aren't using crypto for that. Even fiat solutions like paypal, venmo ect are just better right now because all blockchains suffer from this problem, the more they are used the higher the on-chain transaction fees become.  Bitcoin works great as a store of value. Store of value is a huge market, way bigger than the petty cash transaction market. We don't want bitcoin to be only for the rich, but if that's all we were working towards then bitcoin is pretty much done, the rich have no problem paying $50, $500, or $5,000 transaction fees. They already pay much more for lawyers and bankers storing wealth in offshore accounts and such things. Bitcoin is a swiss bank account in your pocket. So even as it sits right now bitcoin should be worth much more. I mean, why the hell are some diamonds worth $20k a piece? Diamonds are not rare, bitcoin is extremely rare.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:36

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:55
the fees are high because miners are spamming the network to increase the required fee because they have every incentive to do so because it makes them money and there is nothing that can stop them from doing so except more miner decentralization. There, we talked about it.

@_date: 2017-12-31 06:12:20
all decentralized blockchains have a scaling problem, Don't be fooled, there isn't a single crypto ready for the type of transactional volume needed for the petty cash transaction market. Fiat solutions are killing it there anyway. decentralized cryptos can't compete. 
 Bitcoin really has it's priorities straight with keeping the network as decentralized as possible and building a second layer on that. (lightning) 
easiest way to scale up is to make it centralized, but then you lose all the good parts. If there is a door to kick down, or even a few doors, they will be kicked down and KYC AML laws will be forced on the network, nodes will require a license to run since so much data will go through them with big blocks that you'd never be able to run them on your home internet so only miners would do it. Game over.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:16:47

@_date: 2017-12-29 19:55:26
unconfirmed transactions haven't been included in any block, they will just drop off the network automatically if miners don't pick them up and include them. Miners can do a lot to raise the average fee being paid in that pool of unconfirmed transactions. Then choose to include them, and make more money. To be fair, it wouldn't really be that expensive to a rich attacker like a government, or large corporation to spam the network in order to sabotage the bitcoin network to push forward their own agenda. It's just it makes more sense that miners would be doing it since they could actually do it profitably.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:52:47
Is this really this hard for you to understand? all it takes is a 2 or 3 large mining pools to collude to spam profitably, Jihan's best customers viabtc, BTC.top, BTC.com plus his antpool control 65% of the hash power. All in China, that is far more than enough to make spamming profitable, you spam, collect a high percentage of your own fees back while at the same time raising the fee price all of us peons have to pay in order to get our non-spam transactions confirmed. If you seriously think this isn't happening you are extremely naive. Like 5 yr. old everyone is nice and it's unicorns and rainbows outside all the time naive. There is nothing in place to stop them from doing this. Unless you want to go nuclear and threaten a PoW algo change which there just isn't consensus for. The only thing that can make this unprofitable for them is competition, which is currently at a pathetic level.

transactions with the sole purpose of clogging the mempool and increasing the fee required to process legit transactions are spam and only benefit miners. Miners can mine back at least some of what they spent to spam the network plus the increased fees everyone else had to pay due to their spam.  You are naive and wrong if you think they aren't doing this. They have every incentive to do so because it is very profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:28:46


You could not be more wrong, it is clear to me now that you have a lot to learn because you're just in the dark. Soft forks require consensus just as much as hard forks. A contentious soft fork would result in a hard fork. This is objective fact, it is not a matter of opinion.


were you living under a rock during all this? This is complete revisionist history, the core devs never touched the S2X code. They [made it clear]( they were against S2X right from the start, none of them signed the NYA, it was signed by CEO's of bitcoin companies. The bug was a result of poor dev practices by the S2X team. Whether they did it on purpose or not to promote their solution called metronome is another matter, you'd have to ask them. Blaming core for their bug is pathetic.  I want small blocks, because I'm not ignorant, if core proposed larger blocks I would campaign against them and I would not upgrade my node and I'm not the only one.  


no what you should expect from miners is for them to secure the chain without shenanigans, profit is a distant second as a reward for that. Any crypto community is completely within their rights to fire miners if they refuse to do that and hire new ones with a proof of work change or similar.
If you want to persist with these delusions then have fun getting rekt, bitcoin's current road map is going to blow everything else out of the water. I could not be more pleased with the work core is doing. You'd better wise up. Your wallet will thank you.

Bcash is a fork created by a tiny minority of hash power.  Bcash didn't get consensus to change bitcoin which is why it made a new coin instead of just changing bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be changed with consenses. Bcash didn't get consensus thus isn't bitcoin and never will be.

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:44:25


no, you are wrong. The digital signature is still there, it's called segwit, not removewit. You can't spend a bitcoin in a segwit address without a valid signature so stop spreading this. If you continue to from here on out you are a liar.
Bitcoin cannot be changed without consensus. Segwit got consensus from users, miners, and devs, If it doesn't have segwit it's NOT BITCOIN.

right, we can raise it when people stop using it as if it's already a limitless resource. When batching, segwit, LN, schnorr sigs, mast, ect. are all being used by most. Just raising the block size is no substitute for responsible and efficient use of block space.

decentralized, uncensorable, unconfiscatable (if stored properly), transferable across ANY boarders without permission, swiss bank account in your pocket. The rich will pay $5,000 transaction fees without blinking, they already pay far more for lawyers and bankers. If you don't see the value don't buy it. (the rich are buying it).  Of course we don't want the rich to be the only ones who can use bitcoin, but if that's all it will ever be good for then it's pretty much done as is, thankfully we have lot's of devs volunteering their time to make it good enough to be used by all one day. I for one am a patient man.

if this becomes a problem it will effect more than just bitcoin.  Don't forget SHA256 protects a lot more than just bitcoin.  Traditional banking, government secrets, tons of sensitive information would be at risk.  everyone has an incentive to solve the problem if quantum computing makes it an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:02
Blocks must remain completely 100% trustlessly verifiable by any independent individual for bitcoin to remain decentralized and uncensorable. If you think we will ever allow that to be put at risk you are dead wrong and you can GTFO. There will be no compromise on this issue.

it's also unfortunate that miners keep spamming the network, mining their own fees back while at the same time raising the fee everyone else has to pay in order to enrich themselves at our expense.

LN is off chain but not in the way that say, using coinbase is off chain.  LN uses time locks to lock up bitcoin to use on the network in a "channel" and then settle everything on the blockchain later.  So you're still using bitcoin, not some derivative.

Nodes enforce the rules, not miners.
Worst case scenario all signaling miners start mining S2X.  Original chain may become 1/10 as fast temporarily, until the difficulty lowers. but that wouldn't make it unusable by any means. Personally I think there is zero chance miners follow through with mining a chain that has no established value, they mine for profit not ideology. Even if they do core nodes won't be validating their blocks, so they'll be spinning their wheels wasting money for an unknowable amount of time. But I fully recognize the fact that no one can predict what will happen here, so we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:11:43


Not really, they need to profit or they go bust.  What is more likely?  They fork off and mine S2X which has no established value? or they continue mining bitcoin which does?  I don't have a crystal ball but I guess we'll see.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:46:48
gaining consensus with most of the ecosystem is something that takes a long time, can't be done limpwristedly like their so called attempt.  I don't know how many want it, S2X proponents haven't bothered to gain consensus from users.  There are full nodes though which can easily be run by users.  Currently core sits at almost 7,000 and S2X sits at 180 full nodes, seems like if S2X had support among bitcoin users it would have much more than that.  Also core dev luke-jr attempted a KYC verified [coinbase poll]( but it didn't get a lot of respondents.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:16:16


doesn't mean they will mine it, they are just showing what change they would like, because it would benefit them if it happened.  Miners will continue to mine whatever makes them the most money.  I doubt that will be S2X, it doesn't even have a price yet.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:14:43

1) No one new will have to "learn" segwit.
2) No kidding, ya think?  There is no one fix for scaling.
3) Segwit doesn't do anything to "keep" blocks full.
4) yes so so many, so many you didn't bother listing any.
5) The whitepaper is a proof of concept not a holy writ of unbreakable commandments.  As a cypherpunk, Satoshi would not approve of your appeals to his authority.  If he wanted to lead bitcoin development he would have stuck around and done so.

Can you say the same of all the alts with their smiling VC's promising the moon and stars with their ICO's?  If bitcoin loses we lose a truly free monetary system not controlled by any establishment.  What happens if litecoin wins and Charlie Lee is seen as the owner of litecoin and is targeted by governments or vengful ex-central bankers?

Over 90% are signaling 2X but that can change at anytime.


yes it would cause problems, but they are temporary.  they would last until the next difficulty adjustment.  Or, this is a tangent but not out of the realm of possibility, core does an emergency change to PoW which would render millions of dollars worth of miner equipment unusable on bitcoin and thus possibly worthless.  Big risk they are taking.  This would go down in history as "pulling a bitmain".  "Don't try to force a hardfork man you don't want to pull a bitmain".


yeah they would be accepting a brand new coin without replay protection putting their customers and businesses funds at risk for no good reason.  I'm honestly astounded at the risks being taken here.  It really makes me think they have no idea what they're doing.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:16:40
that would be torture for some people.  but the article states Bitcoin *Seizures*.  That means taking bitcoins from people by force.

We could raise the block size to 1T, nodes would drop off the network and only be in large datacenters, people would backup their files for free on the blockchain using that space until blocks are full again, but now you can't go back to 1mb blocks and the network is now centralized in a few datacenters, trivial for governments controlled by banks to shut down. Bye bye bitcoin. Can't have it competing against banks.

No it isn't their philosophy.  It is economic reality.  You can't have low fees on something everyone wants to use.

core made segwit which effectively raised the block size to up to 4mb, Most nodes will be able to handle it.  it's just opt in so people have to voluntarily decide to use it.  Segwit also better enables layer 2 systems like lightning network.   So progress is definitely being made.

@_date: 2017-08-11 04:56:04
I really hope you're not trolling me or this is a waste of time but here goes.
they aren't the ones limiting space, that would be the miners doing that.  They make tons of transactions to themselves to intentionally make blocks full so users have to pay a high fee to be included in a block, they then mine the blocks collecting their own fees back on top of the higher fees they've now made users pay. which makes them more money, which is why they mine, for money.  
Miners don't need any help from anyone else to keep blocks full.  Stop blaming core for what a bunch of scummy Chinese miners are doing to bitcoin.  You can oppose 2X for [these reasons]( while still supporting bigger blocks.  Totally possible to do.

That's impossible.  We could raise the block size to 1T, nodes would drop off the network and only be in large datacenters, people would backup their files for free on the blockchain using that space until blocks are full again, but now you can't go back to 1mb blocks and the network is now centralized in a few datacenters, trivial for governments controlled by banks to shut down.

a long time if left completely to the miners, I don't feel like doing math right now.


well there are miners and miner pools, but this gives some idea.  


There's this KYC validated coinbase poll by luke-jr  which is not perfect since not everyone uses coinbase but it's something.
there is also full nodes, which most users can easily run, it seems to me that if most users supported 2X they would be running btc1 nodes right now but there aren't many of them.

No, that's not consensus, it can't be forced like that, if your BIP fails to get consensus then I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you, fork off I guess. 
You're not going to get devs to do what they believe is bad for bitcoin.  Many devs started out as big blockers, including [luke-jr]( and [peter todd]( until they realized raising it too soon too quickly would be a great attack against decentralization.  decentralization matters far more than scaling. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:48:12
Do you run a full node or not?  Do you know why it is important for individuals to be able to afford it?  full 8mb blocks could cost someone in Australia hundreds of dollars PER MONTH to run a full node, you going to pay that?  If the answer is no then we must do everything to keep bitcoin decentralized until bandwidth is cheaper.  Decentralization is more important than block size.  2nd layer solutions can be the things that are more centralized without threatening bitcoin's decentralization.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:51:55
It's more about showing the people behind the NYA how bitcoin really works, you can support bigger blocks and be against S2X at the same time.  If they want to change bitcoin they can submit a BIP like everyone else instead of their scummy behavior.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:38:41

Unlimited bandwidth doesn't exist.  You can't raise the blocksize high enough for everyone on earth to make all their daily transactions on it AND keep bitcoin decentralized at the same time.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:36:05
Totally depends on what the miners end up doing.  Original chain may become 1/10 as fast temporarily, until the difficulty lowers. but that wouldn't make it unusable by any means.  Personally I think there is zero chance miners follow through with mining a chain that has no established value, they mine for profit not ideology.  Even if they do core nodes won't be validating their blocks, so they'll be spinning their wheels wasting money for an unknowable amount of time.  But I fully recognize the fact that no one can predict what will happen here, so we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:29:33
Gavin was never "in charge" of bitcoin.  No one is.  He actually believed Craig Wright was Satoshi without evidence.  He just trusted him.  In an industry where trust is for the lazy and the ignorant.  Not a guy I care to listen to.

@_date: 2017-08-25 20:22:10
Storage isn't the issue, it's bandwidth and latency.  A newcomer coming in to run a full node years down the road isn't going to download the blockchain and take up his bandwidth for weeks/months/years.  He's got netflix to watch.  The bigger the blocks the longer the nodes take to verify all the transactions, pretty soon 10 minutes per block won't be long enough to do that for every node.  This is a recipe for centralization and is an attack vector for destroying bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-18 05:53:58
this.  
the more you raise the block size, the bigger an advantage you give to those with better infrastructure, leading to centralization.  The closer you get to centralization the more plausible it becomes for government to say, pass a law to license all miners and full nodes or face fines.  You can also forget about running nodes over Tor.

Most of the devs who want small blocks don't work for blockstream.  There is no point in raising the cap, if you do that what is stopping miners from artificially filling them up, mining their own fees while at the same time driving up the cost everyone else has to pay to get their legitimate transaction in the next block?  Miner decentralization is far more important than raising the block size at the moment.

There are PLENTY of reasons.  You can support 2mb blocks and not support the NYA at the same time, totally reasonable to do.
if the NYA isn't proof that corporate leaders don't know shit about coding then nothing is.  They are putting the cart before the horse, cracking the whip and then wondering why the cart isn't moving.  Their time scale is absurd.  This is a multi-billion dollar network, not something you use the "move fast and break stuff" method on.  NYA's timescale is absurd.  If you or anyone else supports it then you know nothing about development.  Bitcoin will scale, no need to risk reckless moves like this.

He claimed they are being held in a "tulip trust", as if this would prevent him from proving he owns them.  If he won't prove it then that by itself is proof He's a con artist.

It doesn't show usage.  It's pure speculation.  Look at a litecoin explorer.

all this means is they are signaling for what they want, for what benefits them.  In no way does it mean it will automatically be the main chain.  Ultimately they will mine whatever makes them the most money.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:30:34
They only need to recover a small amount of their fees for this to be profitable, do the math.  You act as if this is a theory when we know it's actually happening.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:44:16


You look so dumb right now.  The core devs are brilliant for doing this, S2X is cancer, No one cares if "inteligent" people think otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:15:07
in my mind there is a difference between snark and telling someone to STFU about full nodes if they don't even run one.  but I guess I'm just crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:44:55
Why anyone would seriously support an agreement made in a closed door meeting is beyond me.  If you want to improve bitcoin you do it with a bitcoin *improvement* proposal (BIP) like everyone else.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:18:05
then it just becomes a game of cat and mouse, there wouldn't be much value in doing this, it wouldn't be stable.  Markets hate uncertainty.

There is zero evidence to support your conspiracy theory.

The fact that segwit is an ingenious innovation and raising the blocksize *isn't.*
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:00:10
Why should they agree to a doubling of the blocksize?  You think they should just bend the knee to miners spamming the network to mine back their own fees plus the higher fees they've now forced others to pay in order to enrich themselves while falsely showing the need for bigger blocks?  Or are you dumb enough to think this is "propaganda" and not happening?  Do you run a full node? Bandwidth is not cheap for everyone. Are you going to pay through the nose to run a full node? If the answer is no then we must do everything to keep bitcoin decentralized until bandwidth is cheaper. Decentralization is more important than block size. 2nd layer solutions can be the things that are more centralized without threatening bitcoin's decentralization.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:31:02

Then what do you call miners sending tons of transactions to themselves, filling up block space and mining their own fees back while at the same time raising the fee everyone else has to pay to get their normal transaction through?  Spam fits fine, even if it is technically incorrect.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:48:29

@_date: 2017-08-09 23:26:57
Do you run a full node?  How is bandwidth not a good argument against increasing the blocksize?  Bandwidth is not cheap for everyone.  You want nodes to be centralized in server farms so they can be targeted by bad actors and shut down/be forced to comply with REAL arbitrary requirements?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:08:25
This isn't just an open source project, it's a network worth billions.  You can't "move fast and break stuff" here like you can with other projects without real value.  What kind of developer would take marching orders from people that aren't paying them and work to meet an absurd deadline.  Core was right to ignore these idiots.  This agreement was made by a bunch on impatient ignoramuses putting the cart before the horse and then cracking the whip and expecting the cart to move.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:09:18
and the higher the blocksize gets the more people will either run at a loss or drop their node.  Congrats, you've now heard a convincing argument against raising the blocksize.  Segwit is already a blocksize increase that will increase bandwidth requirements on nodes plenty.

Bitfury never mined BCH.  Some miners see this for what it is.

because your "legit concern" doesn't have an immediate solution.  It's going to take time to fix.  and it will take time for alllll the other alt coins to fix too if/when millions of people use them like they use bitcoin.  So calling it "madness" and acting like the sky is falling isn't helping and just spreads fud.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:10:02
I don't understand how anyone could be a "fan" of big blocks.  You can be a fan of the theory sure, but it's an untested one.  The "big block" chain's blocks vastly consist of smaller blocks than bitcoin's.

Dear core, please really don't consider 2X since you already knocked it out of the park with segwit which is already a 2-4mb increase.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:34:57
bigblocks have nothing to do with the bounty, it's to prove the ridiculous and outright scummy claim that anyone can steal from segwit addresses because they are "anyone can spend" is false.  I haven't paid much attention to litecoin, I hadn't heard they raised their blocksize above 1mb.

That's a lot of text just to say **** Australians.  Everyone needs to be able to enforce the rules using their own full node.  8mb isn't enough for all coffee purchases to be recorded forever on the blockchain.  You're going to need gigs and gigs, on chain scaling is a dead end.  If it were the solution then [the people who have been improving bitcoin for years]( would be for big blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:46:14
Either way, without replay protection you will send coins from both forks when you make a bitcoin transaction because btc1 is refusing to put replay protection in.  Proof to me that they are bad actors.

Every 2016 blocks, so it could take awhile, it all depends.


~10% of miners aren't signaling for the hardfork.  


It's been mentioned but I don't think anyone is serious about it at this point.


It's supposed to be whichever side has consensus, I'm not 100% clear on it but I think it is about 80% - 95% of everyone, users, nodes, miners, devs.  If it's less than that or unknown/up in the air then a split happens which is what we are facing now.  After the split, whichever one is bitcoin is mostly opinion.  But in reality I've never seen a derivative work be considered as the original work.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:11:03
I wouldn't care if it was 100% of miners signaling. Miners don't decide what bitcoin is. I would only care if 95% of miners, devs, and users agreed with it. That is not at all the case which is why this will be a contentious hardfork. S2X is an altcoin. S2X never attempted to gather consensus, thus never attempted to be bitcoin, thus never will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:50:01

Sorry but all this drama is a GOOD thing, it is PROOF that no one controls bitcoin.  All the elites who clearly aren't developers, who want to force changes through bitcoin can suck it.  No one is trying to ram through hasty changes on any alts because they don't matter.

If you are running a full listening node you're going to need a lot more than 8mb every 10 minutes. If you have 100 peers connected how much data do you think they will be downloading from your full node every 10 minutes? maybe you have amazing bandwidth but even that won't be enough once you have to increase the blocksize even more because 8mb only allows a paltry 56 tps, we will need thousands for a new monetary system and millions for micro-tansactions. block size increases just won't be enough to scale a decentralized blockchain AND keep it decentralized. It can scale a centralized one fine but that's just going to turn into a private business run out of data centers not a decentralized blockchain.

When it's completely unfounded yes it's utterly stupid. This is a meritocracy, Not a dictatorship, Core has no control over who chooses to run what bitcoin client, the reason 97% of people running nodes choose to run core is because they are the best. If you don't like them then run a different client.  Pointing the finger of accusation at them claiming they control bitcoin when that is utterly false is akin to a child pointing the finger at a better football player and accusing them of cheating. Core isn't cheating here, they're just winning, they're just better, don't like it? Compete, good luck.

@_date: 2017-11-09 03:15:27
you're right it is less secure, what you can do is add your receiving address from your hardware wallet to your node as a "watching only" wallet. That way you can use it to verify payments on your own without risking any of your bitcoin on the node wallet.

r/bitcoin is just one place on the internet, if I want to read BS I can go to r/btc or a million other places, not censored. 1/3 of the world's internet is censored, REAL censorship comes from government. Perhaps someone who is anti-censorship should focus on that. People in a censored country would roll their eyes at what some people here call "censorship".
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:19:53


yes, and we still don't need one.


yes. GOOD. GO USE A DIFFERENT CONSENSUS THEN, the fact you weren't able to convince the vast majority of people to run a client that raises the block size means that you didn't get consensus, which means you either support the status quo or you fork off! It's a voluntary system!


I know it's hard to admit that the implementation failed because it was wrong, and you'd rather blame "consorship". but you need to come to terms with the truth, r/bitcoin is not bitcoin, it's just one reddit sub on the internet. It doesn't have ANY control over bitcoin's development.  If the core devs announced here that they were raising the block size to 2mb tomorrow I would immediately begin running a new client or just refuse to upgrade, and I wouldn't be the only one.

Yes spreading BS is forbidden, you don't get to spread BS lies in order to sell your competing coin here sorry, you've got a million other places on the Internet to do that.  Speaking of things that are "fucking retarded", Your concept of censorship is fatally flawed.
Objective lies, BS, and spam are what is "censored" here. *Real* censorship (the kind you are trying and failing to ascribe to this sub) comes from government with 1/3 of the internet being censored, getting kicked out of a private reddit sub is you being told to take your BS somewhere else, not censorship, If I want to read BS I'll go read r/btc or anywhere else on the internet, not censored.

No it's moderated, not censored, If your posts aren't being removed by a government or you're not being threatened with the law or at least being charged outrageous fines by the government for using your ability to speak then you're not being censored.

ooo scary. 51% attacks are less profitable than mining honestly. It's cute that you think this could happen. No, We won't be capitulating to miner threats sorry, they are toothless, playing a game of chicken they can't win. They are free to mine what ever they want to mine. Leave or stay doesn't matter to me. Bitcoin is changed via consensus not threats, we are leaving the threat monetary policy (fiat) behind. 
A PoW change will need to happen eventually anyway though. Maybe this will be a good opportunity to do it? Bcash had to hardfork a change to make their chain survive, it would be hilarious watching them hypocritically claim bitcoin is wrong to do the same thing.  I very seriously doubt it will come to that but if it is necessary to save bitcoin then so be it. Miners have the right to mine what they want and everyone else has the right to collectively hire new miners.

No, not all, I did say *almost*.  You'll always need a transaction to get on the LN, and no doubt people will want to close and store their savings off the LN. I just see eventually more LN channels being opened than closed as it becomes easy and convenient to transact with almost anyone within a few LN node hops paying a tiny fee per hop. Obviously the main chain will always have to be robust and healthy in order for the LN to succeed.
So the only consequences IMO are good ones.  The LN isn't "off-chain" in the same way that say, bitcoin on coinbase.com is off-chain. Bitcoin on the LN is bitcoin that never leaves your control, not a representation of bitcoin in the hands of a 3rd party.

Store of value &gt; Currency.
has it ever occurred to you that stores of value are more valuable than currency per unit?
Good luck competing with fiat solutions which right now are almost always free for the user, bitcoin doesn't get it's value from competing in the petty cash transaction market, it gets it's value from being a decentralized, permission-less, store of value swiss bank account in your pocket. NOT currency.
BTW there are several LN test networks so that is **by definition** NOT "vaporware".  The petty cash transaction market can wait, Core has their priorities straight for sure. Store of value is by far the larger, more valuable market.

devs present BIPs, the ones that get consensus among devs get merged, Those who run nodes either upgrade or refuse to upgrade or switch to a different client. If the vast majority are upgrading it's pretty safe to say there is consensus.  If all else fails, you fork and people go their separate ways.


This is why the big blocker side always loses, you fucking REFUSE to respect consensus mechanisms, and instead mock it. You REFUSE to understand how a decentralized system works, why the hell you don't just go use bcash or ethereum or any other coin that doesn't give a shit about consensus/decentralization instead of beating your head against a wall that WILL NOT move is beyond me.

un-upgraded nodes see them as anyone can spend transactions, so they are seen as valid, this caused a bunch of ignoramuses to freak out and claim that literally anyone can spend bitcoin in segwit addresses, but un-updated nodes only SEE them that way because they're not upgraded, it doesn't mean they actually ARE anyone can spend. Un-upgraded nodes simply don't have the code to see them as what they are.  There are thousands of un-updated nodes, it's not a problem.

That's a pool that controls 14% of the hashrate and is signaling NYA when none of the miners *using* the pool have ever requested it. Which seems to be par for the course for chinese pools, as far as I know only slushpool allows individual miners in it's pool to signal what they want. This is supposed to be consensus to you?

the entire market has grown and market cap is easy to game,
Transaction fees don't bother me. at all. 
nearly all crypto has at least some fee when plenty of fiat options are free for the user.
Bitcoin's market cap comes from the store of value market which is orders of magnitude larger than the petty cash transaction market. It is a way to store value 100% under your control only. It can't be changed out from under you, changes to the network require consensus, no changes by a central authority can happen. If you don't see the value in that then lol oh well. Don't use it.

It was a so called "upgrade" that only corporate suits and big miners wanted. It was canceled so they could all save face because they finally realized it did not have consensus and it would have failed.


we all move on to real upgrades now.


The two sides have an irreconcilable disagreement on how to scale bitcoin. r/btc gave up on trying to get consensus to change bitcoin and instead made their own alt coin BCH to compete with bitcoin, good luck to them, may we part ways in peace.
Consensus is how bitcoin is changed without splitting the network. A hard fork changes bitcoin, a *contentious* hard fork creates an alt coin.  If you want to know a surefire way to tell who is an enemy of bitcoin whether they know it or not is if they disparage and mock consensus, or flat out lie and claim they have it when they don't. Remember that.

The man is a liar, he refuses to retract his lies. This is propaganda to convince people it's not safe so they can follow it up with "bitcoin isn't safe anymore, bitcoin cash is cuz no segwit!".
1. There are no coins. Bitcoins don't exist. You are changing numbers in a ledger. Segwit is a way to do it that uses less space in a block. Multi-sig addresses are more secure but use more space in a block, are multi-sig addresses not bitcoin?
2. COMPLETELY FALSE. I can't believe anyone could claim this with a straight face. Segwit addresses cannot be used or manipulated in any way without a valid signature from the owner. The signature is just moved to a different part of the hash. It's called *segregated* witness, NOT *removed* witness.
3. See 
4. techno-babble. see 
5. A signature is still required for segwit transactions, same security model.
go ahead and try to move coins in a segwit address without a valid signature, There are millions of dollars worth in segwit addresses now. I'll wait.

that might make sense if bitcoin had lost market dominance to other coins but that's not what happened is it.  Bitcoin's market cap has only grown, not shrunk. Transaction fees aren't an issue obviously. Besides, fiat solutions are killing it in the petty cash transaction market, crypto competing there is getting rekt. Very oversaturate.

If miners want to do a 51% attack then they are the ones doing the underestimating. There would be serious consequences, they would lose all trust, sure some people would cheer them on out of spite but the majority of us are level headed, live and let live, let the market choose types of people.  Not to mention the economic consequences, it might even drive people to coins that don't have miners like IOTA or Byteball, it is not in miner's interest to burn their industry. It is a theoretical attack for a reason, it's just unthinkable, it was always presented in the past as an attacker with no profit motive like a state actor buying up miners and purposely using them to try to destroy the chain. Not profit driven miners. I don't think it's a risk at all.

how would it take it away? There will obviously still be a verifiable ledger. It's just that no one needs one that stores your personal transactions for all eternity for everyone to see if they match your identity to them. LN adds privacy as well as scale.
if you open a LN channel you won't just be able to transact with one person if you open it with a hub, you'll be able to transact with anyone who is also connected in some way to that hub, so if you open a channel with a person and that person is also connected to a hub you can transact not just with them but with potentially millions or billions of people.

as I understand it the LN basically time locks bitcoin via code so it can be used on the LN and settled on the block chain later. With further development it'll likely be possible to keep updating the time lock to keep them on the LN longer if desired.
If so it would be possible to keep bitcoin on the LN almost indefinitely and just keep sending and receiving with free or lower fees than blockchain transactions.
If so it would be possible for people without bitcoin to make a lightning wallet and buy very small amounts of bitcoin to use on the LN. Making bitcoin an instant, very low fee petty cash transaction system when using LN.
Such a well developed LN as this definitely won't be ready when the first implementation is released though, this is just looking further ahead.
but such a system would keep bitcoin decentralized and uncontrollable by any power on earth while allowing it to be the cheapest way to transact with crypto-currency and at the same time being the best store of value on the planet.
this is my opinion only, I could be wrong.

I don't think you need any bitcoin to receive bitcoin on the LN. Just a LN wallet with a bitcoin address for settlement.  I think most people in the future will elect to keep their bitcoin on the LN for as long as possible and just use it there. I say in the future, because I think the LN will need to be more developed and robust to get to that point.

Don't worry, it's just a bunch of scumbags playing chicken with Bitcoin, they will lose, the fork will fail and your bitcoin is safe.  If the 2X chain survives and you have 1 bitcoin then you will own 1 bitcoin and 1 2X coin.  The problem is splitting them so you can spend them independently. Look for a guide to do that and **USE EXTREME CAUTION** if you decide to do it.

NYA supporters are not bitcoiners. Bitcoin is changed via consensus with the BIP process. Not men in suits signing papers. Bitcoiners know this. NYA supporters will learn it by sad experience after the fork, hopefully they have lots of juicy buy orders for 2X coins open on exchanges for bitcoiners to sell into so the lesson sinks in deep.

the way banks create digital "dollars" on a ledger via loan generation will eventually crash as these loans go toxic and aren't paid back. That is almost the same as those dollars being lit on fire if they were real paper dollars (which would be deflationary). for example the dollar has increased in value since 2008 when this happened. It can definitely happen harder since no lessons were learned and the banks were bailed out and they're just doing the exact same shady things now as they were pre-2008.  If that happens dollars would be more scarce because actual physical cash dollars are actually pretty scarce compared to digital ones. So the remaining dollars would be mostly physical ones while banks are closing and limiting your withdrawals to $50 a day like on Mr. Robot. This would at least temporarily make cash dollars much more valuable. You may be buying a coke with a nickel again like its 1910 or something lol.

why is it always blockstream? why not chaincode labs? they work on bitcoin more than blockstream. Is it because it's fun to say "block the stream". I bet you think that is just the *height* of wit don't you.  This is probably the least entertaining conspiracy theory in bitcoin, seriously, get some new material.  Satoshi put in the 1mb limit which has been raised by core now with segwit, the unconfirmed transactions are a natural result of miners chasing profit instead of securing the chain like they're supposed to, mining is for securing the chain, profit is a distant second to that. So stop scapegoating people who have absolutely no power to prevent it.

The people who came up with the NYA are shady and deceitful, which was no one in this sub and no one from core supported it.

There is zero evidence to support your conspiracy theory.  Core doesn't work for blockstream, a few core devs being paid by them doesn't mean the rest of the core devs are too.

You've got miners signaling for segwit but mining blocks with no segwit transactions in them or nearly empty blocks.  You've got miners signaling for the NYA doing the same thing, 2X has segwit so why signal for it when you're rejecting segwit transactions at the same time?  Signaling is not and never has been a reliable metric for what miners WILL do.  Every time I look at what the 2X proponents are doing the [benny hill song]( pops into my head.  It's just silliness.  I doubt it will crash the price, bcash didn't crash it.  So that's one hardfork down and one to go.

lol no, miners aren't going to dig a hole no one is paying them to dig when they could get paid to mine bitcoin.  90% would only slow bitcoin to a block per hour temporarily, completely weather-able and that's just worse case.  I highly doubt 90% of miners would do that.  Jihan's miners probably but the rest can't be digging for worthless coins for too long as they'll go bankrupt.  Hodlers can just hold until miners capitulate or the difficulty adjusts down and blocks speed up with the remaining miners.  Hodlers can hold far longer than miners because it costs them nothing to do so. f2pool is out, bitfury said they won't support s2x if it hard forks so they're out, slush is out and at least half of the unknowns are out, so that is almost 25% of miners who won't start digging in a worthless hole.

He claimed they are being held in a "tulip trust", as if this would prevent him from proving he owns them. If he won't prove it then that by itself is proof He's a con artist.

@_date: 2017-10-27 03:48:22
Well I'm no expert but It starts with a BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) submitted by someone proposing a change.  Which is reviewed by core developers and if it gains consensus with them it gets merged into the core client. (note 2X proponents never submitted a BIP, they just held a closed door meeting and made an "agreement" instead). Once it's merged into the core client users who run full nodes (which should be all users since it's the only way to trustlessly verify you are receiving real bitcoin when you transact, using a service you are essentially trusting someone else, something bitcoin was invented to eliminate.) Either decide to update their node if they agree and refuse to update if they don't. If most nodes are updating that shows consensus, the change is then flagged for the miners to activate, if they don't want to activate they fork off. Generally they stay regardless because they are the only participants that get paid by the protocol. They follow the money, and money follows good management. B2X nodes have flagged for the fork to begin on a certain block number in November, so the nodes begin the fork process and miners either activate it or continue with the old consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:29:34

no group has dominion, certainly not core. If you want to replace them you will have to out compete them. They have no control over who decides to run their client, they can't stop anyone from switching, they have no control.  Yet 97% run their client, for a reason.  So good luck.

@_date: 2017-09-07 20:00:21
When Bitcoin started nodes were miners. When that split off, enforcing consensus stayed with nodes and miners get rewarded for following the rules with the block reward.  They can follow the rules or fork off.  You've got miners signaling for segwit but mining blocks with no segwit transactions in them or nearly empty blocks. You've got miners signaling for the NYA doing the same thing, 2X has segwit so why signal for it when you're rejecting segwit transactions at the same time? Signaling is not and never has been a reliable metric for what miners WILL do.  So saying 90% of miners will mine segwit2x which has no known value is silly.  Even if they do, 90 minute blocks would only be temporary.  Bitcoin has far more hashpower than it needs to secure the network, it can stand to lose some temporarily.

listening nodes are nodes that your node downloads new blocks from.  So they use more bandwidth. a non-listening node is all that is needed for you to trustlessly verify that you are receiving real bitcoin.

Most miners, at least Chinese ones (which is most miners, I think?), know next to nothing about bitcoin and don't care.  All they know is that they have ASIC's running 24/7 making them money.  That is what a Chinese miner on World Crypto Network said anyway.

There are other implementations, feel free to go use them. Be advised, their devs mainly just copy and paste what core does.  Only way another client will be better than core is if the devs maintaining it are better.  This is a meritocracy.

It's the only way to 100% trustlessly verify that you are receiving actual bitcoin. If you aren't running a full node you are essentially trusting someone else.  Also, I'm no expert but I think It adds more peers to the network too, if you have port 8333 open then you are adding your bandwidth to the network so others can download and verify blocks faster.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:13:06


@_date: 2017-10-31 18:35:22
Yeah and the miners supposedly started signaling for segwit because they thought they were compromising and would get 2X later. I don't think the big miners are so stupid that they would actually think a bunch of companies signing an agreement to change bitcoin would actually be able to deliver.  I don't buy it. I think they just activated segwit to save face.

try maybe 75% Which is an amount of people you could fit in a small office building maybe?  f2pool is out, bitfury said they won't support s2x if it hard forks so they're out, slush is out and at least half of the unknowns are out, so that is almost 25% of miners who won't start digging in a worthless hole. The rest can do what they think is best, if they are dumb enough to take such an enormous risk they can go right ahead.  The bitcoin mine has $50,000~ worth of bitcoin every foot that is dug down. The S2X mine isn't opening until November and currently there is $0 worth of S2Xcoin every 2 ft. dug down, and it will stay at $0 no matter how much miners want it to be worth something unless people are willing to pay for S2X coins, and in order for it to be worth digging there S2X will have to be worth MORE than bitcoin, because it will be just as difficult to dig in the S2X mine as it will be to dig in the bitcoin mine. So why dig there when you could dig in the bitcoin mine for a profit?  Good luck with that, Miner signaling has never been a reliable metric for what miners WILL do and thus it has never mattered.

It doesn't need to, Everyone and their dog wants to buy treasury debt. at auction there are 3 bidders who walk away empty handed for every one buyer. The national debt isn't a problem, it will peak and begin to decline. That's got nothing to do with the FED, they are way less powerful than you are making them out to be, the government gets it's funding from taxes and bonds, the fed owns ~12% of the debt, US individuals and institutions own more than twice that.  They don't print money.  That is false. What they do is much more insidious but they are not even close to all powerful.  Governments get funded via taxes and bonds, they did that before banks existed and they'll do it after they exist.

No, I want miners to keep signaling for it, in fact I hope it gets closer to 100%.  That way when the fork happens and most miners keep mining bitcoin despite what they signaled for we can put this silly "only miner consensus matters" narrative to rest forever.

there is nothing stopping all those users from running full nodes, unless you have poor bandwidth that prevents you from running a full node, which most core devs have done their best to keep the block size small enough that that isn't a problem, lukejr even wanted to lower the block size to allow more nodes, though that very likely won't get consensus.  You need to participate in consensus finding or else you are just along for the ride. It is likely that nodes would represent what most users would want though, users and node operators often have the same desires IMO. 
Most nodes aren't listening nodes so that would be the 100,000 number, you don't need to have port 8333 open to gain all the personal benefits of a full node and it will be much easier on your bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-10-24 04:26:39


This is hyperbole, to suggest that core hasn't looked at a block increase is just flat out wrong. Not only that, the effective block size has been raised safely through a soft fork with segwit and can continue to be raised the same way as needed. Core has done it without hard forking and will continue to offer brilliant ways to scale further. I've never been more impressed with them than I have the past few months.

@_date: 2017-10-20 00:50:53
It just changes who is really paying for the fee. Everyone pays by having their own money purchasing power inflated away.  If you don't want that to happen to your money you can use bitcoin. Bitcoin Fees will be worth more than the block reward in a couple more halvings.  The only people who need to be worried about it are miners. Those who are no longer profitable will shut down, then if enough shut down the difficulty will adjust down until more hash power comes back online making it go up again until it stabilizes, this is an issue that only effects miner profitability.  Bitcoin has way more hash power than it needs.
We've never had a truly deflationary currency before, It is uncharted waters.

contentious is the opposite of consensus in this case.  Segwit got consensus from devs, nodes, and miners. Plus it was not a hardfork, it was a soft fork. Soft forks are backwards compatible thus much safer, hardforks are not and carry significant risk. 95% of miners are signaling 2X if you believe 100% of miners in a pool agree with their pool operator (most pool operators don't allow individual miners to signal what they want), 97% of nodes aren't 2X nodes (BTC1). [Devs]( are clearly against it.  Can't call that anything but contentious.  It clearly isn't consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:00:45
true they aren't forks since they actually respect consensus (so far).  bcash failure is subjective, sure looks like a fail fest to me but to each his own. B2X is all but guaranteed to fail. UASF succeeded as others have pointed out.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:25:48
Other coins are not bitcoin, this shouldn't have to be explained, clones don't increase the supply of bitcoin and 99.9% of them aren't being used by anyone, their blocks have almost no transactions. clones have not harmed bitcoin at all, if anything they have helped it by gaining more attention and talent to the crypto-currency space, any innovation by an alt coin can be implemented in bitcoin.

real nodes mean a lot, yes of course nodes spun up on AWS temporarily as a sybil attack don't mean anything. Running a full node is the only way to trustlessly verify you are getting bitcoin and not something pretending to be bitcoin. Using anything else is essentially trusting a service.  It's "dont trust, verify" not "trust, don't verify".  A future where you trust a node in a data-center is a future where bitcoin is controlled by the elite and you get what you're given.  No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:54:08
Never because that's never happened.  If bitcoin developers pushed for bigger blocks suddenly they would be stopped by real bitcoin supporters, the ones who know how bitcoin works.

see this is why I want miners to keep signaling NYA and hardfork.  So we can all laugh as they continue mining bitcoin despite their "overwhelming consensus" and we can put this retarded narrative to rest forever.  Sadly I'm sure the miners will drop NYA signaling soon just to save face.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:20:29
I don't disagree with you, not sure how I am being naïve.  BCH is a cash cow for miners and BCH hodlers are the cattle.  It will be the same with 2X but hopefully to a lesser extent as it seems to me 2X has less user support than BCH did but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:47:03
Listen to yourself, you are basically saying it is acceptable to change bitcoin without user/dev/node consensus by attacking it until most everyone else capitulates and calls the attacker's fork bitcoin. Why you think this is acceptable, ok, or even likely to happen is beyond me.  If this happens it means bitcoin is not resistant to being unilaterally changed out from under everyone like we thought and not only will I be selling my B2X coins, I'll be selling my bitcoin as well.

wtf are you smoking, it's the complete opposite of "hard factual data". Most pool operators don't even allow miners within the pool to even signal what they want, miners are forced to signal what the pool op signals. That's supposed to be reliable?  No we won't know the "factual" percentages until it happens.  Everything before then is an estimate.  I would be shocked if more than 50% of miners went against their own economic interests and mined S2X for any significant length of time.

Segwit got consensus from users, devs, and miners.  If it doesn't have segwit, it isn't bitcoin.  Bitcoin cash did not gain consensus, which is why it created a fork instead of changing bitcoin itself.  Bcash never attempted to gain consensus,  thus never even *tried* to be bitcoin, thus never will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:38:44
well, what can I say, that's their choice, that's the risk they themselves are taking. There is no consensus mechanism for users other than running a node. I suppose users could just sell their bitcoin en-mass, if enough of them did that would show pretty well a BIP doesn't have consensus maybe.

There will be a split even if one percent of miners want it. Hell, I could split it myself with my miner, but it won't survive without majority hash power. And it won't keep majority hashpower unless people pay MORE for it then they are already paying to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:05:57
I'm not aware of any core devs that didn't want it. 
Nodes didn't resist it, miners ended up 100% signaling for it and activating it. Plenty of people were pushing absurd lies about it, I really doubt any of them even owned bitcoin. Segwit got as close to 100% consensus as it gets really.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:29:23

@_date: 2017-10-24 19:40:13
and nodes validate the ones that follow consensus rules and reject the rest.  If I'm running my full node then I'll only get bitcoin, no one can pass off b2x blocks to me as bitcoin, they will be rejected. Running a full node is the only way to trustlessly verify that what you are receiving is actual bitcoin. You are essentially trusting someone else any other way. BCH people don't care about running full nodes, they just trust.  The bitcoin motto has been "don't trust, verify" for years for a reason. Bitcoin was designed to be trustless, so you don't have to trust the person sending bitcoin to you, you can verify that it is legit bitcoin on your own with your own full node.  "trust, don't verify" should be the BCH motto and we'll see which system wins.

that's one theory, but we'll never really know. The fact is they activated it, so that's on them. They should have known a bunch of bitcoin businesses making an agreement wouldn't be able to deliver.
Most devs are core devs and most people run their client so 97% of nodes are core nodes.

you're right, it is a huge concern, which is why some core devs are working on making running a full node more user friendly with more features users would like. As well as making them easier to set up and run.  Best thing to do is educate users on why it's important IMO.

A confirmation every 90 minutes would suck for sure, but it would be a great opportunity for certain people to absolutely trash miners, politically it is a stupid move for them.  No doubt more and more people would call for a proof of work algo change in order to speed up the network again.  Which would absolutely WRECK miners financially by bricking their miners.  I don't think they are that stupid, but for sure we should do everything we can to convince people not to support stupid, absurdly rushed "upgrades" like S2X so we don't have to waste time with these damaging and risky political skirmishes.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:14:54
Hahahahaha, dude, you're ignorance is making me laugh out loud literally. 90% hash power means they will be mining 10% SLOWER on the 2X chain right after the fork and that is only IF ALL those miners really do start mining it. If they don't and they keep mining bitcoin then what could easily happen is the 2X side of the fork being the side that is super slow, not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:37:34
No I'm not "wording it differently".  I worded it correctly and your wording was completely false.  Miner signaling has never been a good metric for what miners WILL do in the past, they are just signaling what they WANT, not what they WILL do, and most miner pools don't even allow miners in the pool to signal, they are forced to signal what the pool chooses, so I don't know why you keep saying what "will be". Why are you so confident miners will mine 2x at a loss for any significant length of time? everyone else can outlast them because it costs nothing to hodl.  I don't have a crystal ball though so I guess we'll both get an education in November.

@_date: 2017-10-07 07:00:21
Why doesn't it make sense? Doing nothing to prevent bitcoin's death makes sense?  I will always support the side of the fork that protects the principles bitcoin is built on, and I'm not the only one. 
 Malicious miners have always been a theoretical threat, if it comes out of the realm of theory then doing whatever is necessary to combat the threat is what needs to happen. Miners do not unilaterally control bitcoin, they don't control ethereum, they don't control litecoin, ect. ect. ect. If the current miners don't want to mine bitcoin anymore then we can higher new miners, we'll do a PoW change and brick all ASIC miners from mining btc, they can be used to mine bcash. No one has ever said "I want to buy the coin with the most hashpower!".  
This probably won't happen though because people are currently paying the miners $50k per bitcoin block right now.  Very doubtful people will pay miners more than that to mine B2X, and if they don't pay more, then what *should* happen is miners will keep mining bitcoin because it's more profitable.  If they continue mining B2X at a loss then that means they are trying to force a change and/or are being subsidized by a bad actor and we should act to defend bitcoin with a PoW algo change or a difficulty adjustment.  That is what bcash did with their EDA and that is why their coin survived the hardfork, they would be hypocrites if they dared claim it's wrong for bitcoin to do it.
edit: the scenario you mentioned wouldn't be contentious, consensus is the vast majority agreeing, it's consensus, not unanimous.  You being alone mining with 1cpu would be irrelevant.  You wouldn't mine a block in years.  Sorry It's late and I'm really tired, I didn't read your comment right.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:03:42
not necessarily, pruning nodes don't require much storage and are just as good for signaling what BIP you support and for trustlessly verifying you are receiving actual bitcoin. Yeah I agree it is a challenge, but crazier things have happened. Satoshi thought that SPV nodes would be what most people use but no existing SPV nodes can trustlessly verify and it might be impossible for them to do so.

There is zero chance of that happening. If you think threats are the way to change bitcoin then you've got no idea what bitcoin was created to replace, you may as well cash in your coins now because crypto is dead, it'll just be controlled by whoever controls everything now. 
In the extremely unlikely event that bitcoin doesn't have enough miners after the fork then there will be a PoW or difficulty change to keep it going. Just like BCH did with their EDA which saved it.  Miners better pray it's a difficulty change and not a PoW one.  I for one would be campaigning for a PoW change, since it will need to happen eventually anyway, might as well get it done with an opportunity like that.  Of course that is all hypothetical, No one wants to buy B2X, they'll continue to buy bitcoin.  If miners want to dig a hole for coin no one wants that is their right to do so.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:14:31
If you are referring to "censorship", Most people don't seem to be able to tell the difference between "perspectives" and objective lies, BS, and spam. *Real* censorship comes from government with 1/3 of the internet being censored, getting kicked out of a private reddit sub is you being told to take your BS somewhere else, not censorship, If I want to read BS I'll go read r/btc or anywhere else on the internet, not censored. And there is no "The" repository, If you don't like what core is doing use a different repository. Credibility is earned, there is a reason most people run core.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:24:40
not impossible, just difficult. The responsibility to show a hard fork has consensus rests squarely upon the shoulders of those pushing for it. It appears that those pushing for it either don't care to prove it has consensus or don't think they need to.  Pointing at hash rate signaling and a signed piece of paper is extremely lazy. Proving consensus is something that takes time and effort.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:30:52
I would love to see a PoW change and Jihan's ASICs getting bricked.  It is definitely a possibility and everyone should be letting miners know that they are risking their investment trying to force change with their hash power.  But even if it doesn't, the worst that will happen is a slow network temporarily.  The 2X is a big bluff, they are playing chicken and they WILL lose.  But even if they somehow, by some miracle take over the bitcoin network (won't happen) Hodler's will still have their bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:39:26
of course 2X will fail, nobody is going to pay miners to mine 2X coins MORE than they are already paying miners to mine bitcoin, it's just not going to happen, regardless of any "agreement".

How are they going to dig twice as fast when both chains will have the same difficulty? And how would they get "twice as many bitcoin?" Block reward is the bulk of the profit and it will be the same on both chains.  12.5 per block, which is worth $73,000 on the bitcoin side and 1/5 of that MAYBE on the B2X side if the futures market holds. Do you even bitcoin?  
If you think miners are going to expend just as much energy as they do now for 1/5th of the profit you're delusional. I won't be buying anything that comes out of the B2X mine. I'll be selling it to the suckers who do. and I'm definitely not the only one.

who said I was worried? I know there is no chance of bitcoin being changed without consensus.  It's the naive new users who lose due to the fud, not me.  Of course something can be more decentralized, which would be more robust.  20,000 nodes run by average Joes around the world is orders of magnitude harder to shut down than 100 nodes run out of data centers.  That is objective fact.

There will be a mad dash for the exits and it will go to cash in the first national bank of your mattress, and for large institutions that can't stash billions in their mattress it will flow to US treasury bonds.  It will be like a game of musical chairs but at the end there are no chairs, a ton of money will go up in smoke as banks fail, causing the dollar to wildly deflate.  Hyperinflation is just hype to sell  gold/silver to suckers.  Bitcoin will get little to nothing, it isn't ready for an influx of cash.

US treasury bonds are not real estate, the differences are important and should be obvious.   All the other markets will crash, the bond market will get all the money that escapes from the stock market as people and institutions run for the safety that bonds offer.  Just like has happened over and over and over again in every recession and the last depression.  Better to lose some of your money than all of it.  During the last great depression Millionaires went to wall street in the morning and by the afternoon they were broke, had they moved their money into bonds they would have survived.  Look at the old pictures of well dressed men in suits standing in bread lines.  before the crash a steak was selling in the finest New York restaurant for $7, after the crash you could get an even bigger steak for 50 cents.  That's called a deflationary wipe out.  It's going to happen again, there will be a global reset, NOT hyperinflation.  I am sure of it and have been lining up my positions to make money from it.  But I could be wrong because I'm just an ignorant moron stupid head so don't listen to me, It's your money, do whatever you want with it.

All bonds are not created equal.  I didn't read the articles you linked as they don't allow ad block but all I can say is the ONLY bonds you should EVER buy are US treasury bonds.  Municipal bonds and corporate bonds are utter trash and I think they will definitely crash.  If you want to bet on rates going negative which I believe in my bones they will then the best instrument you can buy to make money on negative rates are 30 year US treasury bonds stripped principle, also known as zero coupon bond.  they are called strips as the interest and principle portions are stripped and sold separately.  The principle side gains in value as rates go lower.  The interest portions rates are fixed, you don't want those.  If there is a panic and central banks send rates super negative in order to stimulate since all their other tricks haven't worked and let's say they spike negative 20% within 2 years.  a ~$500 investment would make you a $500,000 profit.  you can buy a $1000 face value for roughly $500.

dumping treasuries doesn't hurt The US in any way.  If they were able to sell their treasuries then that means there were buyers.  The Saudis and Chinese desperately need the money since their economies are heavily commodity based and commodities across the board are selling at a fraction of the price they used to, they are wiping out.  The US treasury doesn't care who holds the treasuries, they don't pay anything out until the maturity and coupon dates no matter who holds them.  US treasuries are in high demand, at a US treasury auction for every one buyer two entities go home empty handed.  This is why the US debt is exploding and why the national debt isn't a problem, everyone and their grandma wants US debt and as long as they do the national debt will continue to increase.  Same with the paper, the paper just changed hands, it doesn't hurt the US dollar value AT ALL.    The US dollar is increasing in value and will continue to do so.  This is a deflation happening right before your eyes.  Hyperinflation nonsense is just hype to sell gold and silver to suckers.

No and no,  Haven't made any money yet.  I will when markets crash. It's not an everyday event, it's not a yearly event. But when it comes you can make a killing if you have the right instruments.  I'm not going to type out everything I've done.  You can figure it out yourself if you're smart enough, if you want to save the money you already have though it's simple, stash physical cash and open a treasurydirect account and put your cash in a C of I account and/or buy some bonds there for however long until you think you'll need the money.   It's all held in book entry form at the US Treasury department. There is no counter party risk.  Effectively no chance of losing money since there is no broker tied to a dead broke bank that can run off with your money and ignore your phone calls and emails because they don't *know* you!

@_date: 2016-10-21 19:25:40
I think what you are overlooking here is that there technically ISN'T a market for US treasury bonds.  There is a SECONDARY market for them.  A distinction which may not seem important but is actually critical.  US treasury bonds are handled differently than the bonds of other countries.  The treasury department controls them when in most other countries they are controlled by their central banks.  Money from all over the world is flowing into US debt as the other markets stagnate and die.  Banks around the world are putting on a calm face when behind the scenes they are panicking, They don't know what to do, they've run out of keynsian economic tools.  There will be no more bailouts, We are seeing a global deflationary wipe out happening that will likely destroy the financial system as we know it, half of all banks will go broke, 2/3rds of all brokerages too.  there might not even be a stock market after words, maybe a tightly controlled by government market.  US sovereign debt is the only debt that has a chance of being paid back in full.  I see no scenario in which US debt is defaulted on.  Rates will soon be negative so bond holders will be paying the US government interest in order to hold a bond instead of the other way around.  


No you misunderstand, I didn't think you were insulting me, what I meant was that I actually am a moron and you shouldn't take my advice.  Really guy, I'm not here to argue with anyone so I can feel *right.*  You do what you want with your money and I will with mine.

After it happens we can then talk about how to survive what comes next to "fix" it.

If the US gets paid to issue debt with negative interest rates then why would they care what price the bonds are selling at,  how would that hurt them?  The only people who would care would be those in the secondary market.  I've argued this the whole time.  Don't believe the blow and go at the FED about raising rates, it's not going to happen, if it does it will be a paltry amount,  Negative rates is the only Keynesian trick they have left to try as the trillons in QE obviously didn't work.

This is not how cities are formed.  This is manipulation on a massive scale.  US companies that stay in China will go bankrupt and stay that way.  1/3 of US companies have abandoned China this year, lucky for them.  They didn't come back to the US though of course, just moved to another 3rd world country.  The "economic miracle" in China is a total communist party state run fraud.

Lot's of people yes, but it's worth the effort if you can.


It will be very valuable, 97% of all dollars are on digital ledgers, created not through printing but through loan generation.  Much of this and these toxic loans will go poof when the collapse happens, deflating the dollar and raising the value of the dollars that remain.  In the long term who knows, maybe they will fire up the physical printing presses after words.


I don't, maybe I would if they weren't so heavily manipulated in the stock market, fact is their prices will wipe out along with all the other commodities when the crash happens, safer to hold physical cash, a dollar is always worth a dollar.  But like I said before, I am a moron, do not take my advice.


yes they should, I am diversified in lot's of things, just not commodities.  They will wipe out.
Cryptocurrencies are the new kid on the block, will they be the future?  I hope so, which is why I own some, I like the idea that they are permission less, decentralized.  If we can all switch to them then the chances of the mess we are in now happening again in the future go down significantly.

the destroying government part of bitcoin is the part where it can't be counterfeited.  It has nothing to do with anonymity.  If everyone used bitcoin or something like it, governments wouldn't be able to print money at will.  That would destroy current governments.  It might not get rid of government in general but it would force future governments to be more responsible with money since they wouldn't be able to create it out of thin air to spend on all their whims.  Counterfeiting is illegal because it is like stealing from everyone.  It's legal for governments to do it but it still has the same negative effect on everyone else.

it puts downward pressure on the price in the SECONDARY market, when you buy a bond from the treasury directly you pay full price.  The treasury couldn't care less who holds the bonds, a 30 year bond will be bought and sold over and over again before maturity, the treasury doesn't care, they already got their money.  And they only have to pay out money on the bonds on the maturity and interest coupon dates to whoever is currently holding them.
