Also so I can really make you feel stupid, right now average 32sats/byte. Jan 1st 5sats/byte. Can you do 32/5 or should I do that for you? Because it’s actually more than 5x ��

Talks about the data not being correct, You think .15 x 5 is .60 ��

Yeah I agree with you 100% there, not to mention that I can’t send money directly to my bank account using binance. But hopefully this is the foundation for binance to get on the same level as coinbase

This is without a doubt the stupidest comment on this thread. How in the hell would bitcoin and crystal meth be related in any way at all? Just because you can make them legal or illegal? You can do that with anything.

Absolutely I agree, I think the point here is that warren buffet called something “rat poison” that would have actually made him quite a lot of money. I don’t think anyone is trying to say warren buffet is a bad investor, or at least I’m not trying to.

That’s what the “should start buying” is for at the end, obviously he made the right call he’s a billionaire and no one is better at investing than him. Just something to think about it is all

Asinine title doesn’t change the fact that just because a typo says 3 months instead of 2 months the hash rate is still up 35% from low in November.
