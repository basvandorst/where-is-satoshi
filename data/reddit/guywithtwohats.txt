Then why are you calling it ["individualized customer losses"](
And if that's not what you're intending to do, then you absolutely cannot allow withdrawals!
So either you're not being honest when you're repeatedly saying that you're going to allow withdrawals as soon as you're confident that the security breach is contained, or you're not being honest about your intentions on how you're going to handle customer losses.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:35:11

@_date: 2016-08-03 18:31:54
And that's why the attempted distinction between "affected" positions and "unaffected" funds is entirely meaningless for anyone other than Bitfinex' internal investigation.

@_date: 2016-08-03 03:08:53


Is there any evidence for that? As far as I can tell, Bitfinex internal system that handles user funds got hacked. This does not affect individual accounts, it solely affects the deposits handled by Bitfinex. The only reason why Bitfinex is trying to label this as "individual customer losses" is because their system assigned nametags of customers to their internal addresses (to more easily keep track of things I suppose). This is of noone's concern but Bitfinex, and it should absolutely not mean that someone should be more affected by this loss just because his nametag happened to be on one of Bitfinex' internal addresses that were stolen from. That's just beyond ridiculous!

Everything. Your target audience were inexperienced "investors" in the crypto space, who can be lured in by a website with a countdown and some vague promises, and who readily hand over their bitcoins without doing their due diligence. Hell, if I remember correctly, there wasn't even a link to the terms on the crowdsale page with the countdown. Also the way the whole thing was set up, leaving everyone in the dark about the actual share their investment was worth is just ridiculously sketchy.

And how were individual wallet holders supposed to secure their own funds exactly? Users had zero control over how the funds were handled, right?
But whatever, going to bed now. It might turn out that my account wasn't even among the "affected" ones. What a joke regardless.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:26:22
Based on what legal grounds are you making the decision to socialize losses among one group of customers/creditors but not others?
Either Bitfinex is liable for the losses as a company, which almost certainly means they would be insolvent and would have to undergo bankruptcy proceedings, in which case all creditors and all assets are treated *equally*.
Or they try to argue that they are not liable for the losses for whatever reasons, in which case Bitfinex absolutely cannot decide to spread the losses over a group of creditors to their liking, just because Phillip G. Potter thinks it's "fair".

How can you even consider allowing anything to be withdrawn at this point?
Also how can you justify that some users get their balances marked as "stolen", while others don't? Why should users care about which of your hot wallets had their nametags on them? It was all Bitfinex' funds that got stolen from their system.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:26:56
That's not how I understand that comment, but fine. Either way, they are in no position to even consider allowing withdrawals of any kind at any point in the near future. That's what irks me so much about these comments where Zane basically tells people that they will be able to withdraw once the site comes back, as long as they weren't "affected" by the hack. Because that is utter nonsense.

[This comment]( suggests getting an immediate injunction:


@_date: 2016-08-03 02:47:51
But Bitfinex users have no choice, they're all using the same internal system, which got hacked. As long as users don't have any control over how their deposits are handled by Bitfinex, then there's also no grounds for any kind of argumentation that some internal addresses belong more to one user than they belong to a different user. They all belong to Bitfinex.
And regarding your 2FA question: in that case, actual individual user accounts would have been hacked. This was obviously not the case here. Their internal system that handles deposits and withdrawals for *all users equally* got hacked!
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:39:14
This stupid analogy again!
But okay I'll play along: does that then mean that all unopened deposit boxes will be force opened by the bank, and their contents spread among all the robbed deposit box holders? Because that's what Bitfinex is proposing here. Do you now understand how stupid that analogy is?

No, the fanboys are still fanboys.

People like that who are solely interested in their altcoin of choice because they are waiting for the next pump make up a large part of any altcoin community, and I don't think monero is an exception here. And pretending that it is is in fact disingenous. The fact that there's also a more pragmatic group of people involved in the project does not change this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:45:29
There are no bitcoins to buy from settled long positions, they all got stolen. So the closing of the position is just an accounting farce to assign the loss from the stolen bitcoins to some poor shmuck (in this case the lender of the USD I suppose).

Where is the link to the terms of the crowdsale on the actual crowdsale page  ? And even if there was, it doesn't change your target audience who couldn't give two fucks about anything, as long as there's a countdown and some vague promise.


Except, like you say yourself in the usual hidden way, the portion is based on the final valuation, which obviously couldn't be known until the crowdsale was over. So no, investors had no idea how much equity they got when making their investment.
You know, since you apparently want to have this discussion here right now: how could anyone be sure that Mycelium itself isn't simply going to buy a big part of their own shares shortly before the crowdsale ends? That way, you reduce everyone's equity for no cost (you buy your own tokens), and you even inflate the valuation of your company, reducing the potential future payout based on a new valuation even more. Sketchy. As. Fuck.

@_date: 2016-08-03 18:23:46


Of course they do. They still own the btc they bought with the USD. However, Bitfinex might not be able to honour that ownership, because their wallets got emptied. In the same way as Bitfinex won't be able to fully honour any of their other liabilities any longer.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:52:42

@_date: 2016-08-03 02:19:31


As a user I don't care one bit how you internally handle user deposits. As soon as I deposit bitcoins, they are no longer under my control, but under the control of Bitfinex. If your system gets hacked and bitcoins stolen, you can't just go around and say "well, the stolen bitcoins happened to be in an address that we internally assigned to your name, so it's your individual loss". You can't possibly expect this argumentation to hold up, can you?
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:46:16


The user has absolutely no direct control over the bitcoins in "his" bitgo wallet. So to say that anything was "delivered" is more than misleading. The bitcoins are still in full possession of Bitfinex, as a liability to the user who bought them on their platform. Most users weren't even aware of any bitgo wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:50:52
So does that mean that individual user accounts got hacked?
From everything I've read, this is not the case! Your internal system that handles all user deposits and withdrawals for all users got hacked. You just happened to have a labeling system where you assign nametags of customers to your internal addresses, but that is of noone's concern but yours!
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:49:29
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:43:27
*You* keep calling it individual customer losses. *You* keep telling people that only some accounts or positions are affected by this, and those that are not will be able to withdraw their funds once the security of the platform is restored. 
It's very simple: you can't talk about going to allow withdrawals for "unaffected" customers, and at the same time tell me that you haven't decided that you're going to put the losses on individual customers based on your internal wallet labeling system.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:20:17

@_date: 2016-08-03 23:16:05
There wasn't much to analyze: the moment they realized that they've lost 120k bitcoins, they knew exactly that their only option left is to deny all liability and not refund any of the losses. And the best way to do this is to treat it as "individualized customer losses", so some users lose it all (very sorry for your loss, kthxbye), while others lose nothing (see, we're not so bad after all, you can trust us). 
All this stalling is just to figure out how to best cover their own asses, and how to sell this "compromise" to the community in such a way that enough idiots will be cheering for them and keep them in business.
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:05:04
Yeah, they counted their own Voxel altcoin as an asset against their obligations. Except Voxels aren't really traded anywhere, and there only was some kind of crowdsale for it or whatever. So the price of Voxel pretty much means nothing, and they're essentially worthless.
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:35:28
This is likely the right answer. They are capitalizing on their good name in the community. Money first, everything else later, maybe. They would be stupid not to do this, as it's so easy to get money from bitcoiners in return for nothing but vague promises.

What should be asking himself right now is whether he has reason to believe to be partaking in fraudulent activity and potentially ruining his life.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:35:34
I understand that. My point was that all the wallets were exposed in the same way. So if someone manages to circumvent your hot wallet security measures, they have access to all your bitcoins. A completely irresponsible setup in my opinion. 
Anyway, I know it's probably not your fault, and you're just doing your job here. I'm just confused by you insisting on calling it "*customer* funds" in "segregated *customer wallets*". Do you guys think that's going to help your case somehow?

@_date: 2016-08-03 03:18:37
Sorry, but you're being obtuse. 
As far as I can tell, your internal system that handles user funds got hacked. This does not affect individual accounts, it solely affects the deposits handled by Bitfinex.
The only reason why Bitfinex is trying to label this as "individual customer losses" is because your system apparently assigned nametags of customers to the internal addresses used by your system (to more easily keep track of things I suppose). This is of noone's concern but Bitfinex. Just because a customer's nametag happened to be on one of your internal addresses that got robbed, doesn't mean that user's account was affected in any way! The only thing that it affects is Bitfinex's liquidity to honour their liabilities to all of their customers.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:06:22
Good point.
If they allow traders to pay trading fees with BFX coins, always at their nominal value of $1 regardless of the spot price, then that might work out quite well too, and even give traders an added incentive to stay on Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:12:07
Like I said, they're capitalizing on their good name in the community. The free wallet they provided was their investment to build this positive reputation. Now it's time to cash in. 
I'm deliberately being a bit extreme in my choice of words here. They might be doing all this in good faith. But it's impossible to tell from the information that is available so far.

I don't think the article is talking about Bitcoin. They're talking about blockchain related initiatives in banking and finance which are largely unrelated to Bitcoin. And I agree with the gist of the article that these projects are overly optimistic and overly hyped, which is neither reflecting their questionable real-world application, nor the low funding and manpower they actually receive.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:02:09
Interesting idea, thanks for sharing.


I think this even goes one step further, and the knowledge that a workable defense mechanism could be implemented already acts as a clear deterrent.
@_date: 2016-09-10 16:17:13
Of course. It's just that "control over the network" implies more than that for most people. Including James D'Angelo, who explicitely mentioned the "cabal" of Chinese miners potentially imposing new consensus rules via a 51% attack in the BU podcast.

Without the transaction ID it's unlikely that anyone will be able to help you.
@_date: 2016-09-10 00:15:03
But is that really a problem? 
The argument the BU guys were making is that the optimal degree of decentralization for routing value via the Bitcoin network is largely unknown, and that the self-regulating forces based on the many economic incentives inherent in the whole system will lead to a degree of centralization that is just about "good enough". And that's why striving for decentralization just for the sake of decentralization achieves nothing, and a certain degree of centralization might actually be the more stable equilibrium.

Just because walletexplorer lumps some addresses together as a "wallet", does not mean they belong to the same person.


And again, you have no idea whether this is still the same owner or not. You're just guessing at this point.
etc etc.
If you follow the chain of transaction back enough, you'll always find "something" (usually some exchange address). But that something doesn't necesseraly have to do anything at all with the bitcoins you're trying to identify.

Blocking IP ranges. Hell even creating a whitelist of trusted miners and pools for a while. That could happen within days. It might turn into a bit of a cat and mouse game maybe, but every day costs the attacker loads of money, just to cause a bit of disruption. But there's no reason to assume that the network as a whole would be unable to deal with this in a definite way.

@_date: 2016-09-10 17:37:07


Yeah that's the nuclear option. I doubt it's the only one. And again, a 51% attack is extremely costly for the attacker with every day that it's being kept up. Assuming the rest of the network would react by also increasing their own hashpower, it can't be kept up indefinitely either.

Where does the "likely" come from exactly? Wouldn't it be a lot more accurate to say that there is a risk that the reimplementation is in some way incompatible with the Core codebase? Unless you've audited the code and found that this will be the likely case, you don't know anything about the likelihood of such an incompatibility.

The main problem with James D'Angelo's positions is that his assumptions about the economics of a miner monopoly are wrong, and that he doesn't understand that the cost of running a 51% attack is still pretty much the same, even if you already control these 51%. So even if his assumption of a Chinese cabal of miners were true, these miners have no economic incentive to go against the interest of the rest of the network, because that would only kill their golden goose.
So what's left of his argument is his concern about a majority of the hashrate being located in China, which makes it susceptible to sudden arbitrary intervention from Mr. Xi Jinping, who some day might decide that he wants to stop the leaking of capital out of China via bitcoin mining. But even if he then decideds to not only shut down the miners (the rational solution), and instead use those miners to 51% attack the rest of the network everywhere else in the world, it would only force the rest of the network to apply measures to stop this attack (like hardcoded blocking of the Chinese IP ranges as an easy first step for example).

Don't worry, blockchain.info is saying that it is estimated to confirm very soon because it has high priority.

Except an SPV client will likely connect to different nodes over time, only revealing small bits of information to random nodes. With Mycelium, they can easily track your bitcoin activities from beginning to end. Also, because they are in a privileged position to create this perfect profile about you, they are much more likely to do so than some random node that only sees small pieces of your activity.

There is no "the fee". There are only estimates of fees that get your transactions confirmed either sooner or later. In situations when capacity is near its limit, these estimates can fluctuate a lot, and will be wrong often.

@_date: 2016-10-27 12:53:21
Except there is no such thing as appropriate fees. In the end it's a guessing game where wallets try to deduce/extrapolate from the recent history and maybe also from what they see in their current mempool. And when capacity is near its limit, then this is bound to fail often, resulting in seemingly stuck transactions (especially bad for users without deeper understanding of how this all works) as well as forced "overpaying" to be on the safe side (bad for everyone).

As soon as the work done by the PoW function has utility outside of the Bitcoin network, it could potentially affect the self-regulating balance of the network in a negative way. The most obvious example for this: external incentives for doing PoW could lower the cost of a 51% attack.

Exchanges would actually have a hard time splitting the bitcoins between the two chains, as this requires more trickery with Bitcoin than sending it to a splitting contract in Ethereum. So they would probably think twice before going through the trouble to offer both chains.

Except digix itself is just another useless token.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:42:08
It's honestly not a fair comparison, as a Bitcoin blocksize hardfork would have a different dynamic to it:
First of all, the long interval for difficulty adjustments makes it hard for the chain that ends up with only a fraction of the hashrate (as was the case with ETC) to stay viable. Depending on the timing of the fork, confirmation times on the minority chain would stay super high for a very long time, which acts as an incentive for any strugglers or people who are unaware or undecided to make the switch. 
Secondly, the fork would have a higher capacity than the old chain, making transactions cheaper. This again provides an incentive for users to make the switch, as the fork is simply cheaper to use for them.
And thirdly, the "replay attacks" would actually help in resolving the fork in the case of Bitcoin, because splitting bitcoins between the two chains is not as easy as with Ethereum. So again, people would have a hard time distinguishing between the two chains in the first place, because all their transactions get mirrored. This means that keeping the slower, weaker and more expensive chain alive makes no sense at all, as it doesn't offer anything to anyone.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:07:02
Good point. The only counterpoint that I have to this is that producing heat is such a common byproduct of pretty much anything, that the incentive just isn't specific enough to doing PoW to matter.
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:36:41


Of course they are...
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:56:10
Yeah you're probably right. But what about the inverse of the hash function? Which would really be the relevant part in the context of PoW, which essentially is finding an input (the nonce) that produces an output (the hash) with certain characteristics.
