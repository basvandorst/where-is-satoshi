He speaking of something that is more like a geological shift than a catastrophic event. The disintegration of the nation-state and its current monetary structure does not mean the collapse of all infrastructure and economic activity.
Honestly, the whole time I was reading this article I was thinking of nothing but Snowcrash and The Diamond Age as models for what these new replacement structures would look like lol.

The main takeaway for a bitcoin subreddit is that during paradigmatic shifts in human ways of self-organization: Roman Empire to Papal Feudalism to Capitalism and so forth, there arise shadow systems which operate alongside the prevailing, and often times failing, system. These shadow systems often foreshadow the structure of the system which will replace it. 
So his main point is that he thinks capitalism is going to fall to another structure by 2100; a seismic shift in our self-organization will occur. This is due to a number of factors but mainly 'neoliberal banking' and capitalism out performing itself, which is an idea that dates back to Kapital.
What he seems to hope this will look like is a return to primitivism, small-agro sustainability, solar power and etc etc
What I think is more relevant here is that digital currencies and their underlying technologies are precisely these sorts of co-operating shadow systems that arise as old structures start to lose their ability maintain themselves. I mean the feudal system didn't give up power willingly, it had it wrested from it by merchant capitalism. Capitalist Nation-state based systems may very well find themselves unable to compete at some point in the next several hundred years and have control wrested from them by whatever it is that has emerged from the shadows to take its place.
