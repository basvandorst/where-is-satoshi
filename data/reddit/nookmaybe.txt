This should be on every crypto subreddit. Holy crud this could hurt a lot of people :(
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:37:55
The exchange would know where it came from. They’d have your anonymous account but could link that account back to where you sent it from. You’d then send it to the new wallet which would be anonymous but the exchange knows where it came from and where you sent it.
If anyone got into that server, legally or otherwise. You’ve lost that anonymity. Also you have to trust the exchange not to want to give away your anonymity. Not saying they would but who knows. There’s a lot of ways to find out where those bitcoins came from, and exchanges do get hacked. 
So I would say.. no, you’re not really anonymous, just more obscured.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:48:44
Yup, it just did. At least it dipped.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:29:09
Agreed. Nice and to the point.

What’s the snack machine thread?
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:56:04
I would say the problem with an obscure exchange is, how safe is the data from hackers? Or the us government forcing entry. Or a staff member leaking data for a price. They just need to see the linkage once and they know who those ten bitcoins belong too.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:30:18
Well done lol, rick rolled me good.

Took me a second. Lol, nice one :)
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:24:07
I appreciate this! Thanks for posting it. It’s fantastic to hear how it’s being used (or in this case, rarely used).
Wallets fee suggestions are indeed garbage. They’re always terribly higher then needed.
Asking someone to switch to lightning when they clearly don’t understand bitcoin (lost my keys, oh well... that was just wow).... ya they aren’t going to understand lightning.
Overall, this shows people are trying. But these things need to be resolved. And that’s what’s happening, but we are definitely not there yet.
If you just want to store your money, it works well. If you want to send a payment across borders it works way better than anything else. There’s lots of good and currently useable use cases for bitcoin. But buying 20 dollar items at a store... not yet clearly.
Anyway, thanks for posting!

Oh shit this is rip bitcoin  Shut it down!
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:01:03
Agreed. Bitmain (as far as I can tell) doesn’t have a kill switch for the miners it’s sent out. So it’s only the ones in it’s (admittedly huge) warehouses that they could turn off. The ones people have running in their houses would keep going. 
I’m not suggesting it wouldn’t be a problem if they did it suddenly! But we’d get past it. Just one more attack bitcoin would grow from. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:16:17
Because this is called click bait. Or since this is Reddit, title bait.

He’s saying that putting your fiat money into crypto (on ramp). But he is against people taking their crypto and putting it in fiat money (off ramp).
Basically crypto or die, I think :)
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:11:23
That’s not how this works. If one person with a 386 is mining the system keeps working. Technically best it at least 3 people are mining... And before it gets that low the gpu miners will hop back on. Sorry btc isn’t going to fail if bitmain stops mining. It’ll be fine.

@_date: 2018-05-17 03:11:20
They have a subreddit. Yes it’s fairly new.
It’s a coin worth around 3 cents right now. It’s main thing I believe is that you “mine” it by having an app loaded on your Android phone. It doesn’t actually mine, it just kind of runs. Don’t ask me because I don’t have the App.
I’m not sure how it got on a billboard with the number one and two crypto lol.

Sorry about the other guy.
The manipulation would be by those with either a lot of fiat (money) or those with a lot of bitcoin, are making the market move. Or using trading techniques to manipulate bots. Or really anything to try to explain why the market is making sudden erratic movements. 
So yes, generally people say the whales are doing what they do and making bitcoin crash.

@_date: 2019-12-09 16:12:29
There’s a lot to unpack here.
Quad is gone gone gone. Lawsuits and all that going on.
Shakepay is my go to, right now. But to each their own. I’m sure other will pop in with theirs. If your just looking to buy bitcoin, shakepay works well. If you want exchanges to trade, not sure.
Bitcoin cash split off and is still doing its thing. There’s been other forks so I’m not sure where bch is right now. I think there’s been forks of the fork. Again, you’ll need to check out the bitcoin cash sub which I think is btc (weirdly enough). 
Hope that helps.
Oh quick edit: bitcoin (btc) is still going strong and stayed the main chain so bitcoin stayed bitcoin (in terms of chain, not getting into a philosophical debate about it).

@_date: 2019-12-05 15:06:36
On the off chance someone direct messages you, please be careful. That’s how people get scammed. Don’t go to a website they offer. You don’t ever send anyone your private key or “words” (you’ll see these if you setup a wallet). Just be careful. Ask questions in here along the way if you need. Assume it’s a scam before you do anything. Protect those keys!!!
The sidebar has some info as the others suggested. Probably the best place to start.

@_date: 2018-04-26 08:46:43
Man these answers you received are horrible.
First, congrats on finding your lost coins. It’s small, but it’s something :)
Second, you may want to look into mining. You can’t mine bitcoin with regular hardware anymore. But you could mine an alt coin (amd cards are great at ethereum, nvidia is great at zcash i think...). I’m on mobile so I can’t give links but there’s lots of subreddits about mining. If you’d like to start super easy there’s nicehash but people have varying opinions on that (they choose what you mine and you get paid in bitcoin).
If you’re looking to just buy, there’s exchanges to do that. 
I bet most of this is covered in the side bar... so sorry if I’m repeating it. But there is so many different ways you can get involved it’s hard to say any specific one! Have fun!
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:10:56
Thanks for giving it a wing and telling us all how it went! This is how you support bitcoin. Support those who are trying to use it. 
If it works, they may start supporting other options. But if this is as far as they go for a while, it’s majorly better than not having any bitcoin payment options. This is good for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:48:06
Can you explain how this works?
Let’s say I bought it and the box is in my hand. Do I need to set it up with an android? Connect to my windows pc?
Maybe I missed where it’s explained, but let’s pick bitcoin, how do i use it to run a node and confirm my own payments...
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:47:34
Oops. Perhaps a better title would have been “it might be Mother’s Day” ;)
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:22:46
This would likely be an exchange, possibly moving some to hot wallets as there’s a lot of buying going on. Or just further securing their offline cold storage.

Double check your private keys are safe 
Have a plan where you’d like to sell, or buy, now before it happens. Then execute. 
Don’t fomo. If you didn’t want coin x5s-3 when it was .0001 cents, why you buying today when it spiked 40000% over night? 
Get your coins off exchanges unless you’re actively trading them
Don’t invest what you’re not completely willing to lose 
Trust nobody. It’s not that everyone is out to get you but they’re probably not out to help you.
Please look into the GitHub for the coin you’re looking at. And the discord if they have one. A little research goes a long way

If anyone asks you for you private key, DO NOT tell them. 
If someone claims to be from bitcoin support or what the heck ever, they’re lying to you to steal your crypto.
Assume all advice is someone trying to steal your crypto. 
There’s some books on bitcoin that would be worth reading such as the ones from Andreas Antanopolous (I probably spelt that wrong I’m on Mobile lol). He also has a YouTube channel where he digs into crypto, though often overly technical for a new person I believe he has some basic videos to. 
Anyway my basic advice is don’t tell anyone how much crypto you have or are getting.

There was a flaw (not sure if fixed yet) where if your electrum wallet connects to a bad node (a node a bad guy is running) they can send a message that looks like an update window. If you click it, you go to a site that downloads a fake electrum wallet to “upgrade” you, and then when you open it and unlock your wallet... bitcoins are moved out immediately by the program. 
So the flaw here is that the wallet allows this popup. People obviously think it’s safe to click because the app is doing it.

Please don’t put you words from ledger into things lol. This exposes the private keys and now you no longer have a fully offline key (the point of the ledger or any other hardware wallet).
To answer your question, if it has a 24 word recovery option then it should work. But again your private key is now online and I’d consider that key/ledger to no longer be cold storage.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:47:17
No, both addresses are valid.
When you receive an amount your wallet will generate a new receive address but your old one is still valid. 
So you should be fine...
