How do investors know how long and how much to squeeze for?
There are multiple rich investors and they are all competing against each other. All of them want to depress the price as long as they can, but sooner or later the price will rise again an no one wants to be the investor who held out for a lower price (thus not buying as much as they wanted) before the next bubble takes off.

A Bitcoin bank wouldn't **have** to have 100% reserve, because everyone isn't going to want their money out all at the same time. Coinbase could be insolvent right now, but they'll stay in business until there is a bank run.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:45:32
I think you're correct. Fractional reserve banking is possible, but much less likely in a Bitcoin economy for a number of reasons: saving is no longer discouraged (slow price deflation is occurring), people can pull their BTC out of the bank much faster and easier (gold had a big problem with this), and there will be no Fed to bailout banks after a bank run (so banks and customers will be much more weary of insolvency).

Even the best possible ROI on a startup investment is overshadowed by even a modest increase of Bitcoin towards it's full potential (Trillions of dollars). I echo OP's confusion: if investors really believed in Bitcoin, they would make orders of magnitude more money by buying it directly.

If the price is too low, then mining is unprofitable and it becomes cheaper to pull of a 51% attack, thus destroying blockchain technology.

And if you bet too late, the bet might not be confirmed before the bet closes and bitbet will keep all your BTC even if you win. Also there is a 1% fee, so you need to earn at least 1% profits to break even.

I'm not sure. They can prove that you hold Euros by getting records from your Euro banks. They can't do the same thing with bitcoin. That's why I'm saying unrealized gains taxes don't work for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:04:40
Those are realized gains. If I just sit on my BTC and don't spend it or trade it (even though it goes up 10x in a year) how would I get audited for that?
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:33:36
Not past $700 in 10 years?!
Bitcoin is not stable where it is now, it must either continue to grow or collapse and disappear. In 10 years it will either be worth pennies or over $10,000.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:02:41
Correct. A hard fork of some-sort could be used to reduce the difficulty more quickly.

Just buying (without knowing anything about bitcoin or getting involved in the movement) does help move the movement forward.
Buying and holding raises the price, which leads to more media attention. Check out [the flow chart at the bottom of this article](

Why would you need a crypto-currency to do this? If you have this new MMO-TV Show, you could just have an app for it and the viewers/players could use the app which would handle all transactions internally on the TV network's servers. Initial deposits and payouts could be done via credit card or PayPay (although bitcoin would simplify this part of it).
I don't get the love affair with open, P2P, decentralized networks. They have their uses (bitcoin as global currency) but they are not appropriate or efficient for all uses. he game show still has a trusted their party, so all the crypo-hoops you have to jump through don't have any real benefit.
Also, all this a lot like online gambling, which the US government has been very unfriendly towards in recent years.
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:17:45
I think this is key. Income taxes and tracing money get harder for the IRS in a bitcoin/dark wallet world. But sales and services still take place in the physical world and that's where the IRS can be the most "efficient."
I think governments will switch to VAT taxes when bitcoin takes over since it's much easier to go after merchants than all the individual tax evading citizens.

How do they audit your unrealized bitcoin gains?

This. If you want your exchange to accepts bank transfers, you have to be certified federally and in each state you want to do business. I heard the process takes 2 years and costs over $1 million.

False advertising. The 15 minute payment timeout will limit how far from Earth you can perform transactions. Sorry, no BitPay for the Curiosity rover :-/

Yeah it's bitpay's implementation to lock down price fluctuations.  But it prevents bitpay clients from accepting bitcoin payments from users with very very high latency.

In what way does any government or any organization control bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:19:02
I want politicians to leave bitcoin unbanned and unregulated so that it can grow as quickly as possible. If we have to pay some politicians off to achieve that, it's a small price to pay.

But FDIC ensures your bank account money. Regular people probably don't feel comfortable with keeping their bitcoins safe.

The transition costs of changing currencies is extremely high. I don't think the world will be changing currencies very often or at all once bitcoin takes off.

Two great rhetorical devices the government can use to ban Bitcoin:
1. Link bitcoin to some sort of **terrorist funding**. Then cracking down on bitocin becomes an issue of national security. Americans will support just about anything in the name of national security
2. Link bitcoin to **tax evasion**. Americans love when politicians attack those who aren't paying their "fair share."
@_date: 2013-07-08 21:43:43
Well put. If the dollar starts losing value quickly, everyone holding dollars will look to an alternative (Euros, bitcoin, gold, etc) and the government will rush to ban or limit those alternatives.
@_date: 2013-07-08 22:08:33
Perhaps I misunderstood your question. The government doesn't need any more reasons to outlaw bitcoin. Bitcoin as it exists is huge threat to the government and US dollar hegemony. I'm sure there are already people working on methods of how to ban bitcoin.
A actual terrorist link isn't necessary (remember those WMDs in Iraq?) and the IRS is already losing money to bitcoin (you think all those bitcoin retailers are reporting 100% of their income?).
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:04:26


Instead of outright banning USD to bitcoin transactions, they can make regulatory compliance so difficult that the exchanges shutdown, get fined, and become very inefficient.

The US government doesn't have any money. They borrow $0.30 for every dollar they spend. If they wanted to buy up all the bitcoins it would cost them billions since many bitcoin users would act as holdouts and demand a high price.
The central bank could print enough dollars to buy most of the bitcoins, but that would lead to hyperinflation and destroy the dollar... isn't that what the government is trying to avoid in this scenario?

Bitcoin is simply too small to be of concern to the government at this point. The government is only losing tiny amount of money and power; right now the government is focusing its energy on bigger fish.
But make no mistake, as bitcoin grows into a bigger threat the government will cook up all sorts of methods of cracking down on it.

100% possible, but far less enticing to most bitcoin users. Imagine BitPay goes away and you're trying to convince a business to accept bitcoins and convert them to cash via localbitcoins.
