The volatility that comes with monero is very harmful for darknet sellers. This issue already exists with bitcoin but is much greater with a coin with a market cap this small.
That's why I think the use of bitcoin and using altcoin mixing (buying altcoins then straight back to bitcoin) will prevail.

This is another kind of money printing. James Rickards has been predicting this. It's helicopter money, tax cuts financed by government deficit spending. It's the next stage after QE and a desperate attempt to prop up a very instable system.
They're prepared to dance with the devil. The line is getting very thin between creating inflation and a loss of confidence in paper money, aka hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:45:19


Bad debts collapsing or debts being paid off is deflationary. Negative yields stimulates lending which means extra currency in circulation which is inflationary.
This policy creates a house of cards though, which is deflationary when it comes crashing down.
There is a dynamic going on of an ever worsening economy with more risk and more instability. The central banks need an ever greater stimulus to offset the natural deflationary pressures. This dynamic will become so unstable and will result in either a deflationary collapse or hyperinflation. 
The longer TPTB keep this dynamic playing out the more extreme the outcome.

Yes, there is a system to how the HD wallets are created and they're tied to the same seed.
But if you mean if an outsider can link those HD accounts together, the answer is no, only if you transact between those HD accounts or if you send coins from the same source to those HD accounts, or when you send coins to the same destination.

Contrary to popular believe, in economics it doesn't work like that.
The economy is on an unsustainable path. There needs to be a bust to rebalance the structure of the capital in the economy. (Less debt, more savings, less service economy, more production etc.)
The next QE is always bigger than all the previous QEs combined. QE4 will be bigger than QE 1, 2 and 3 together although they might give it another fancy name. 
The longer the FED intervenes the bigger the malinvestments and the bigger the shock when the economy goes back to a sustainable path.

After so many years of success in terms of price action people are forgetting the other side of the coin. People believe this thing can only go up. Sure, it can go up some more, but every day we go up, we get a step closer to not just a crash that we will recover from like in the last 3 years, but a real bear market that can take anywhere from 12 months to 5 years.
Hodl and don't invest more than you're willing to lose and you'll be fine in the long term, but people are generaly way overconfident at the moment in the idea that the only way is up, and it has been this way for a while now.
What happens in such a situation is that people don't take into account the very bearish scenarios and they overextend themselves. This brings the asset into a lot of weak hands and into the hands of people who are not really strong believers or who can stomach big declines. This results in a prolonged depressed market
It's the natural way bitcoin will move up over the coming decades, big bull markets and big bear markets.
You'll be fine with your bitcoins, but I think people are just a little bit overconfident for the short and intermediate term. That's the only point I'm trying to make.

Well, the truth is, there are a lot of different opinions and assumptions and nobody knows what's going to happen.
We all need to relax and take small steps to see what will happen and learn from it.
When problems arise there will be consensus and the blocksize can be increased rather quickly.

It's not clear how the scaling problem is going to be solved, although there are a few ideas like the lightning network, side chains, inverted bloom lookup tables and Segregated Witness.
The point is. Block aren't full at the moment and there is no consensus to raise the limit.
Core developers don't want to commit to a plan, because they can't look into the future. They want to keep blocks at 1 mb. for as long as possible because of the well known issues. If blocks become full and fees rise too much, there will be consensus and the block size limit will be raised, because there  is true consensus.
Core developers prefer other ways to scale though, because it will make bitcoin stronger against attacks.

Decentralization and security is my primary need for bitcoin. I want people to feel safe to store large amounts in the network. Fast and cheap transactions aren't that important when you can use bitcoin as a very safe store of value with a huge network effect and seemlessly can switch to alternative ways to move value.
We shouldn't want altcoins though. Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins. When you add altcoins you're expanding the money supply.

But then again, they're both old white men who obviously don't understand the tech. Rickard's tweet calling bitcoin "electrons" shows how he doesn't grasp that digital information can be as real as anything. Maybe someone should ask him for an embarrassing digital video of him.

In that case there are 2 main forces.
1. Since Bitcoin isn't pegged to the USD the value of BTC measured in USD will skyrocket.
2. Hyperinflation is very bad for the economic output and overall economic well-being.
The first force will makes bitcoins more valuable, since there will be a rush towards it. The second force will make products and services more expensive and scarce. In the case of hyperinflation, will the price of bitcoin rise enough to maintain your buying power?
I'm not sure, but I think it will be one of the best bets to protect against hyperinflation.

I think they're both very risk averse investors. In that sense it makes sense that they prefer gold. Although risk adverse investors should spread risk and invest a tiny amount in bitcoin.
I've seen James Rickards make some positive comments about bitcoin but Peter  very strongly dismisses Bitcoin every time I hear him talk about it, to the point where he makes ridiculous arguments and sounds like a gold salesman.
Rickards is more nuanced but doesn't really seem to grasp the revolutionary implications of this tech.
Personally I own both gold and Bitcoin but mostly Bitcoin. I'm not risk averse though. If I was I would own more gold.
The gold vs bitcoin is ridiculous in my opinion. Everybody should own some of both.

A ledger is a record of who owns what. You should be able to trust that the ledger is based on truth and is limited in supply.
Any ledger can potentially do this because outputs should equal inputs. The problem that bitcoin solved you can trust the ledger to be valid, just like gold was used to keep track of who owns what.

That's almost what I mean. I mean a system that keeps track of who owns what without punishing its users by debasing the supply, a record that's as flawless as possible in keeping track of who's in posession of this thing that's in limited supply, a form of money that's as scarce as possible so people can only attain it by debasing the other units of account as little as possible, namely by acquiring units that are already in existence and by doing so in a low cost and a verifiable way.
When money outcompetes its competitors in that sense it will have value in the future because there are enough rational actors to recognize the inevitability of this form of money to grow dominant. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

All sources of information that can be trusted can be used as money. Just like you can give a certain amount of gold to someone to communicate value. Gold is difficult to audit and there are portability issues when you like to check if the information is true. Is it filled with tungsten? Does someone really hold as much gold as they claim? This information is sometimes difficult to check. Gold itself is incorruptible (for now), but there are other issues that make it difficult to derive the truth it can communicate.
Fiat money is easy to counterfeit. People do it legally (governments and banks) and illegally.

A worldwide crisis is short term deflationary. Expect money to rise in value and people to dump their assets for liquidity. This is bearish for Bitcoin.
A worldwide crisis is worrysome for the financial system. Financial institutions can collapse and bail-ins can occur. This threat is bullish for bitcoin, people will look for alternatives. After the bail-in has occured, people don't have money to buy bitcoins, this is bearish.
Central Banks will respond with creating billions (trillion?) of Euro's and Dollars, this is very bullish.
So there are some different forces, but overall it's bullish, especially for the long term.

We don't need a year as bad as 2008 but we're going to get one that's much worse. 
The world economy is a leveraged complex system that's showing cracks and is going to change very rigorously.
The thing with complex systems like earthquake prone areas and the world economy is that it's very easy to predict that it's going to happen but the timing is very difficult.
I think we're going to see world wide bank runs and they are going to try to prevent these with capital controls. 
We're going to see social unrest because of this and a complete loss of trust in the ruling class.
When I was younger, when I learned about history I thought we lived in boring times, but we're making history right now. 
Our future generations are going to look in awe at the great centralization of the pricing of money and the creation of debt to stay in control​ and the creation of the massive debts all over the world. 
All these debts can never be repaid. You can create a central bank to prevent a bank run, but the end game will be a run on the central bank. You can't fix a design flaw in the system, the possibility for banks to create more iou's than there is money, by making one big centralized system out of this.
The end result will not be a local bank run, but a national one. 
The elites are putting laws in place to shut down banks, shut down exchanges and markets to prevent these runs. This is all verifiable. Capital controls and social unrest will be the result of this.

That's the problem in mainstream economic thinking. The rates shouldn't be raised slowly. They should be raised fast and to a high level so the damage that is being done to the economy can stop and capital can relocate. A slow rise in rates will make matters worse in comparison to raising them fast.
Central Banks are behind the curve and every day the policy makers don't raise rates fast enough to levels that are in balance with the capital and savings that are present in the economy, capital is being mislocated and damage is done.
If you trick me into thinking that there is enough money in my wallet to go out and take a holiday, make big investments that will bring returns in a few years and sit on my ass, I'll be a poor and hungry dude the moment I find out my wallet is already empty after 2 days and I don't have money for food and shelter.

Since sha256 is uncrackable and since the actions result in a full sha256 hash the only way to realistically crack such a code is by redoing said actions.
Now that I've made this example public it makes it worthless obviously. That's something you didn't take into account.
These are the components of the entropy. Remember each one of them **multiplies** the number of outcomes.
The idea of using Pi (which I made much less valuable now)
The number of decimals used
The idea to subtract an amount
The amount used to subtract 
The idea to start a few rounds of hashing
The number of hashing rounds used
The idea to add some text to the hash
The idea to add the name in capitals
The idea to start another rounds of hashing
The number of hashing rounds.
This resulting in 54 bits of entropy is ridiculous.

An example of how I'd do it is taking the number Pi with an x amount of decimals minus the last digits of my 2nd postal code and hashing that x times. Add the name of my first cat in capitals and then hash it again x times.
I call it leveraging entropy.
That's how I'd do it but I never will use brainwallets.
Edit: My advice is to not use brainwallets that are created by your own mind. I was asked how I would do it, but you should use a proven method. This method is open for debate and why would you take that risk.

Bingo, it's like a teaser rate. People take on more debts because of the low rates and when interest rates rise dominos start falling.
This economic system needs an ever growing debt bubble to not collapse. It has passed the point of no return. In the future 0% interest rates won't be enough so we'll need negative rates or 0% and QE4.
Of course, or economic overlords will tell us that everything will be fine. These growing debts will stimulate the economy and will be paid off and inflated away.

@_date: 2017-10-02 05:26:35
Yes, if you have 5 bitcoins (in deposits), all you can lend is 5, and you wouldn't have any reserves left. That would be 0 reserves banking. If you would lend a fraction of the 5 bitcoins, so any amount &gt;0 and &lt;5, that is the definition of fractional reserve banking.
In the current system it works differently. Banks can just create money, receive 10 dollar in deposits and create a multitude of that amount in loans instantly. That doesn't mean you can't do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:26:59
If 5 people park their car into your garage, and all the cars are fungible and they expect to be able to get a car at any time, but you lend out 4 cars, the moment 2 people want to pick up their car there are not enough cars around and there will be a run on the garage. This is fractional reserve garaging.
Again, read this and you will see the real definition of fractional reserve banking:

Peter Schiff believes that money should be used as a commodity first.
But he's very wrong. Money is a type of "thing" that makes it easy to keep track of who has what.
You want money to be divisible, portable, durable, fungible and scarce. Bitcoin is a very good in doing that and will therefore be in high demand. Money doesn't need to have a secundary use for it to be a good form of money. It's like saying a car only has value because you can bring it to the scrap yard.
Peter Schiff will tell you that there are many altcoins and is therefore not scarce. Bitcoin is scarce. The number of competitors might not be, but bitcoin has a tremendous network effect and first movers' advantage. It's like saying Facebook has no value, because anyone can create a social networking site.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:02:54
Maybe I get killed for saying this, but I think there is going be a time (somewhere within 3 years) that an ounce of gold &gt; 1 bitcoin.

No, they're not buzzwords. It's the easiest way to provide a machine with a steady stream of bitcoin, by providing value to the network.
Just software leaves you with the need to send bitcoins to the device which could have legal issues (money transmitting) and gives another vector that can be attacked.

The truth is that there is a currency war going on, the economy and the government can't handle anything higher than 0% rates and QE4 is coming within 2 years, probably in 2016.

edit for most important quote from letter:
*Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price (consider that air is useful but not scarce, and fish with three eyes are scarce but not useful, thus no price for either of them). Because the Bitcoin network is useful, and because only scarce bitcoin currency units are permitted on this network, the bitcoins themselves have a price. Indeed, they must have a price until the network is no longer useful, or the coins are no longer scarce.*
*This is not magic. It is not a Ponzi scheme or elaborate fraud. It’s just the market pricing something that it finds useful. As the network grows in usage, its utility subsequently grows, and thus scarce bitcoins appreciate further. Those who grabbed coins in the early days benefit hugely, just as those prospectors grabbing nuggets of gold out of the California foot hills did in the early days of the gold rush. Gold is not a pyramid scheme merely because early acquirers profit from later subsequent adoption and demand.*

How markets arrive at a price is purely based on supply and demand. The contributing factors of supply and demand are very complex and can be found things like in psychology, economics, speculation, different use cases and media attention.
Bitcoin will not stay at this price. Eventually, it will go up or down significantly.

Even when the banks can agree on a shared database it's going to be a database of the banks' liabilities to the people.
One of the revolutionary things about bitcoin is that it's not debt based money and it's not an entry in a ledger that is a promise to pay.
Bitcoin is like digital gold, it's an asset without being someone's liability, it's a digital commodity and doesn't need a bank. Banks have become an option and stopped being a necessity, the banking system has become a liability to society, just like the money it's based on.

Front National (FN) is a nationalist party. It makes sense that they they seek to ban Bitcoin. As a nationalist party they favour protectionism and national control. The irony of this all is, the more parties like FN are in power, the harder people need Bitcoin and the more attention it will receive.
In countries with parties in power that seek to ban bitcoin, the topic of bitcoin becomes political and will polarize the political spectrum. Some political parties and proponents will start too seek out Bitcoin, more as a political tool.
Front National will be a great driver of Bitcoin adoption.

Seems quite obvious but ok. The moment they ban cash everybody is forced to deposit their cash in the bank, or it will lose its value.


If someone chooses to hold the same amount of credit in the bank, the person is still forced to buy goods through the bank with what used to be cash. They force you to bring all your cash to the bank, even when you choose to buy goods with it directly.


Your bank treats it like one. Banks use their average checking account deposits and they use it as collateral for banking activities. Your deposit also bears risk, just ask the people in Greece. Not treating your money in a bank as an investment is foolish. You should diversify and you should have cash in your house. Again, ask the people in Greece if that would be a wise thing to do.

One of the revolutionary things about bitcoin is that it's a ledger of ownership of an asset. It's a digital commodity.
Banks will try to make a ledger of its liabilities to customers, an IOU, a promise to pay. They will try to compete with the same old paradigm and model, but only try to make it faster.
In a historical context gold has been the most reliable form of money. Gold has only one disadvantage. It's not very portable and divisible, so people naturally deposited it in a bank for paper money or an IOU. This has shaped the financial system tremendously, where banks behave in a rent seeking way and can exploit their position.
Bitcoin with its digital nature, will change this centuries old paradigm. You don't need to deposit your digital money in a bank in exchange for an IOU. You can if you want to, but you can be your own bank, or you can chose from the many services that exist.
Tl;dr: Bitcoin will change banks from being rent seeking, strategical superior entities to businesses that have to compete for the likings of their clients. Bitcoin undermines the power that banks have.

Inflation is much higher when you take lost coins into account, and you should.
Furthermore, If you realize that many coins are in cold storage and won't be touched for years to come, inflation is relatively big compared to the coins in circulation.
@_date: 2015-10-13 07:52:49
I think nobody know what's going to happen because it's a big fucking experiment with so many variables.
1. Yes the supply increase halves, but the supply still increases.
2. The inflation rate while taking satoshi coins and lost coins into account will go from 11% to 5.5% which lowers inflation substantially.
3. When you take hodlers into account who will not touch their coins until at least $10k per coin the current inflation rate might actually go from 20% to 10%, a big difference.
4. The growth rate of the network is very important. When the growth rate of demand outpaces inflation this should make the price rise.
5. When the price is recovering from a bubble the halving might have no effect, but it seems like the downtrend is over and we're at least moving sideways.
6. When the price starts to rise this might attract speculators and the non-hardcore believers who need a price rise to give them the confidence that bitcoin isn't dead.
Maybe plenty more variables.
My guess is that we're moving into a new bull phase in the coming year anyway so a halving will only help.

The future will show us how things are going to play out and who will be right.
I surely hope I'm wrong and things are much better than I believe them to be. One thing we have in common is that we both want the economy to be in good shape. We just have different believes of the outcome and the current condition.
Central banking policy artificially stimulates the economy in the short run, but in the long it hurts the economy. So if you're saying that things look good, I agree with you but this policy will end in a bust, just like it did in 2007.
Yes, I think workforce participation is very low compared to let's say 10 years ago, yes I think there is a bubble in real estate, the stock market and the bond market.
The calculation of the CPI has been adjusted but overall I think prices have been rising modestly. That is because  market forces are deflationary and central bank policy is to offset this.
I think the real damage is done to savers and investors. While all kind of assets are inflated things don't look as bad, but they are inflated at a cost. People feel richer on paper and this makes the spend more. There comes a day when all these inflated assets come crashing down just like every time after a few years central banks start stimulating the economy more.

I don't get it too. I tend to focus on things I like instead of things I don't like.
The only explanation I have is this: 
It goes something like this.
1. You're not a fan of the idea of Bitcoin.
2. You go to to debate.
3. You get downvoted and people don't agree.
4. You feel hatred for being opposed.
5. Normal people shrug it off and move along. Narcissistic people create a forum and become obsessed by the "group" that once hurt their feelings. Their ego can't cope and go into destroy mode.

The importance of savings are ignored by Keynesians. IMHO it's the biggest flaw in mainstream economics.
When economists talk about spending, consumption and stimulating the economy they forget they undermine the capital and savings of the people. They boost short term activity but by doing so make the economy weak for the longer term.
We're living in dangerous times. How far will central bankers and politicians go by trying to print money and trying to create a wealth effect and by doing so, damage the economy?
With bitcoin people have an alternative to store their savings. For every person that chooses to store value in bitcoin, it diminishes the power of central planners to sacrifice capital for a short term fix. With bitcoin they can not take your value by creating more of it and spending it.

Thanks! I bought the Rolex on the used market by the way. I like the idea of having value for money. Rolex is like a commodity. If you buy smart, you have something that protects you against inflation.
I didn't buy it as in investment. It's a lousy investment. Buy it because you love a watch and the resell value makes it just a much less expensive of a hobby than it appears to be.
Why I bought two? That's a good question. I started out with the Breitling. It was an impulse buy. I was just browsing watches on the airport, waiting for my flight and the salesman offered me 25% discount. I checked prices online and I couldn't find it much cheaper, even on the used market, so I thought, why not.
Now it has become an addiction, or a passion, however you want to look at it and I figured I had to have a Rolex. Every man needs a Rolex, right?
I'd love to have a subby too, but I figured, I already have a dive watch with the Breitling and I wanted something a little bit dressier, because I wear suits from time to time on the day job.
My next buy will be an iconic watch, the Omega Speedmaster, which was worn on the moon, which is a Chronometer, just like the Daytona.
You can buy just one watch, or multiple watches. A Rolex Submariner is very versatile. If you want to buy just one watch, it's a perfect watch to buy. Buying just one watch is perfectly reasonable.
Just don't buy it too soon. Wait until a watch doesn't make a big dent in your savings. The biggest cost in buying a luxury watch is the opportunity cost. I'd hate to buy a watch and to see Bitcoin going to the moon with the money I should have invested instead.

This graph shows inflation in the unlikely scenario that no coins will never be accessible. It's a flawed estimate.
@_date: 2015-10-29 09:25:34
Gold went down because it was a deflationary crisis, a credit crunch. Banks, businesses and people were scrambling for liquidity and would sell anything to be more liquid. After the credit crunch the FED launched QE and gold rose accordingly.
I would argue though, that because the gold market is more leveraged bitcoin would suffer less from a deflationary collapse. The paper gold market is huge.
One crisis isn't like the other. Maybe we're going to have a Greek/Cyprus like crisis, where governments orchestrate bail-ins. This is very bullish for bitcoin, but it will be hard to buy bitcoins when your bank account is frozen.
Or maybe inflation picks up and people start to lose confidence in their national currencies. This is very bullish for bitcoin.

Just start thinking millibits. When a btc is $1000 a millibit is only $1.
When Apple's stock is $1000 its market cap will be greater than 6 trillion usd or 6000 billion usd.
When a bitcoin is $1000 its market cap will only be about 0.015 trillion usd or 15 billion usd.

Well, my wife wasn't a virgin when I met her, so I figured, why should my watch be.
You can buy a new rolex on the grey market. They're somewhat cheaper than a official Rolex dealer, but prepare to lose about 15% depending on the model.
Daytona is a watch to buy new though. They don't lose any value compared to the used market at the moment.

Wrong conclusion. When the price of bitcoin has gone up, merchants notice increased spending.
Deflation = more buying power = more spending
When the price of bitcoin is depressed, people have less buying power and feel poorer overall so they don't buy as much.

Warren Buffett is an appeal to authority.
It's much more nuanced than that. When I hold money to pay the bills and do groceries would you call it speculation? No, right? So why would you call it speculation when I hold bitcoin to have some money to spend.
Holding your capital in stocks for your next month's bill and groceries money is more of a risk than holding dollars.
The speculation argument is flawed and its language limits logical thinking about certain circumstances. It's like putting a label on something that prevents you from analyzing the situation further.

The guy can be too obnoxious for your taste but he's honest about watches and has a lot of experience buying and selling watches which he shares with the public. 
There is a huge market for used luxury watches. If you buy used, you can get about the same price if you sell it on the used market, just like a car or a house.

Your argument is true. There is nothing wrong with speculation, but prioritizing arguments is very subjective.
I don't see bitcoin as a speculative investment and it's very questionable to attribute the willingness of people to hold bitcoin to speculation. When I look at the total money market and look at the different traits that different forms of money have, I just see bitcoin as the best form of money.
So besides using bitcoin I also hold some bitcoins for its fundamental traits. Is that speculation?
