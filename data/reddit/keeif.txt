It's an idea - formed by user consensus.  A user being allowed to think bitcoin cash, gold, or whatever other fork is the real bitcoin is how it's designed to work.

Doesn't nearly every exchange have BCH now?  What exchanges to do you trust?

Source on this being temporary?

Bitcoin is neither a person or brand.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:49:36
It absolutely would.  BCH is enforced under the "no altcoin rule".  Unless it's negative and fits their narrative - like this thread.

That's not what Andreas was referring to in this video and it sounds like he supports forks based on his Decentralized Truth talk.
How is a fork that aims to improve Bitcoin attacking it though? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:33:20
They likely will.  I doubt they're going to just stand by and lose money by not supporting it.

Did you watch the video?  He's talking about governments and financial institutions.

Glad to hear.  I think more and more people are starting to see through the bs.  Cheers.

Makes me wonder why there's little discussion about this; instead the front page is just filled with memes and character assassinations.  As someone who's on the fence, it's not a good look for Bitcoin.

Oh and even the Reddit and Coinbase CEOs:

You seem to be overlooking Joseph Poon's account?  That's the biggest concern.  
I'm not 100% in on this but between the incessant censorship here, Joseph's account, and even things like this thread and some of the users replying to me, makes me think there's some strange stuff going on. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:38:05
One example doesn't disprove the numerous accounts of censorship.
And what have I lied about?
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:30:35
The censorship here is well documented and even people like Vitalik and pro-core Richard Heart recognize it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:49:48
So Joseph Phoon's comments and the fact that there's proof a secret channel exists in the Core slack isn't information?  And I'm the one who needs to get in touch with reality?

You could also make the comparison that Bitcoin is like a one lane road and Bitcoin Cash is like an eight lane highway.  But surely things are more complex than this.

Source of this thread: 
Of course I'll probably be banned for this but blatant lies like this thread are allowed to soar on the front page.  Coincidentally, this is one of the main reasons people are interested in Bitcoin Cash; they're sick of the censorship and centralized communication channels.
edit:  The two users replying to me below only reaffirm my belief in this.  Their comments are just so irrational that I can't believe they don't have malicious intent.

There's no clear evidence.  There are a few things that add up and personally, I trust Joseph and think his words carry weight.  If you don't think so then it probably doesn't mean much to you and that's fine.
Edit:  To clarify, I trust what he's saying because making false accusations like this could be career ending for him,  Greg ignored the claims in his response to him, and no one has spoken out and refuted them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:42:48
This is the exact sentiment that's driving people away from Bitcoin.  It's these aggressive attacks on users who are posting actual information, who have valid concerns, and all you do is disregard them as shills and insult them rather than addressing any points.  Please share your reason for not believing what Joseph is saying.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:58:50
There are countless examples of people getting banned for just expressing their opinions.
