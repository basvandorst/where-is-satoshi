Yea.. why dont you visit gemini exchange right now and see how good their "tech" is.

This is what sets in motion the funding of the bot army.  They will short all of our money away then take over the economical system.

Nice, no worries about the current drop (how do I know? I dont) just keep putting money in.  Ill see you in .. what.. 2 years?  Then we will laugh to ourselves while discussing our wealth.
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:15:58
I'd just take some out.  That so you minimize loss and still have a chance at higher profit.
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:22:31
Well  ¯ \ \_(ツ)_/¯  You obviously are more educated in this area than I am so i'll continue cautiously supporting crypto in the hopes that whatever makes it into the future (BTC or some other form) will change the way we do business and handle our day to day lives.

Right but I think what was being said was that "when in Venezuela"
and having internet you can make a Bitcoin transaction, but had "spotty af" bank transactions.  The whole point of the tweet is still understood.  Right?

I understand your valid point of view.  There was a time though that money was easily duplicated, they fixed that.  Check system easily frauded, they fixed that.  I am not educated in our financial system's errors enough to go on but you get my point that everything has weaknesses, the more adoption increases the more we fix these security issues.

I see coinbase here so much and so little Gemini that I thought I was in the wrong exchange.  But then I started noticing all the complaints and I realized I might have found the gem from the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:45:48
gemini has decent fees

What you're referring to is storage space and not memory maybe you should have said PS4 or PS4 Pro

That is why I like Gemini as they give you the money pre deposit instantly.

You must not know the answer considering you are calling him naive when he is legitly saying he doesn't understand and wants to.  Naive would be that he thinks its a conspiracy or something.

Sending from me to you or vice versa during periods of congestion can take upwards to 3 hours. Today a wallet to wallet transaction took me 1.5 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:02:24
While I agree partially... my issue is in the transaction time.  As a retailer I would be concerned even at the thought of the delay when the customer has already left (not just for the value sake but for the ensuring its in your wallet and not gonna just disappear.)  The fact that I am trying to pay for something that requires USD is secondary to the fact that the transaction is delayed with no confirmations for over an hour.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:08:10
I binged it
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:04:27
*I should have said BTC TRANSACTIONS.. not BTC to USD in itself.  That just so happens to be what I am doing today, but not the case every time.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:24:45


This is interesting. As a customer I agree.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:06:09
Because you are not always able to spend unconfirmed funds.  So the time in between changes the value at which I am buying something.  Even if I am not moving from BTC to USD.  It is just my case today that is involving USD.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:21:50
Exactly .. it's their concern.  Or mine, if I'm the retailer.  That is the issue I'm bringing up.
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:51:38
Ok you tell people to educate themselves, but you fail to realize that while you may be intelligent via instruction you are lacking some information on my part.  I set priority and within priority you have a new set of charges.  I paid 1.81 to ensure highest priority.  Go on with your assumptions that paint you as perfection and others lacking when you fail to ask the proper questions before attacking.
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:53:25
Wow besides one kind PM I got, I am surprised it took that many comments before I got a decent human response.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:01:01
Wow I'm a BTC supporter but good fucking luck with mass adoption if this is how you treat people who are concerned with downsides they actually experienced... Sorry I thought that the priority at which I send my transaction would increase its speed considering that is literally how it's worded...but I guess it was my own stupidity that delayed the transaction.  The only thing I learned today is don't bring up downsides of BTC in @_date: 2019-05-03 19:27:36
Why are you so rude?  And why are you assuming I did not choose priority? You seem on defense.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:20:39
Hey man, if you think that works for you then cool.  Problem is you may just be satisfying yourself instead of others actual issues or questions.  I leave here today not knowing how I could of made that transaction any faster.  Can you tell me how I could have without blaming me for not calculating space and time before sending the transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:23:29


Very interesting that part.  As a customer I agree.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:25:21
Genuine question here do I have to do anything different when transferring from wallet to wallet to be on that Network because today took me 1.5 hours to transfer BTC from wallet to wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:24:52
This may be the grey area in my concern and they don't trust it yet. Either would I as a retailer if someone could potentially fake that transaction.
