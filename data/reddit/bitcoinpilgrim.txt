Same way its done with gold. The amount of paper representations of gold that are traded vs physical gold is 500 to 1. 
Just because there is no transfer of the asset itself, does not mean thats its price cannot be manipulated by the trading of contractual representations of it. There will likely be significant rehypothecation of paper representations of Bitcoin via dark pool derivatives markets.

Before the noob hounds decend upon me, I preface this by saying I have held bitcoin for over 6 years and will continue to do so...for now. 
The answer is yes. Any crypto could unseat Bitcoin....for this reason, or any other. 
What would make it more unlikely for this to happen, is if adoption grew to the point where a significant network effect was realized and it became a part of peoples everyday life. If it were used to buy goods and services as often and in as many places as fiat currency, it would be extremely difficult for an alternative to displace it.
The majority of the early bitcoin community realized this, and spreading adoption amongst peers and businesses was one of the primary objectives. Now, this narrative about store of value only, combined with high fees and slow transactions has taken a significant amount of momentum away from everyday use adoption.....leaving the door open for "a better mousetrap" crypto to displace it. 
Bitcoin should be attempting to spread its everyday usage as wide as possible, as fast as possible. Instead, it is being directed toward being a niche speculative asset with a dwindling early mover competitive advantage.  The more it is used to replace everyday fiat currency, the safer it is. The more it turns steers away from this, the more vulnerable it becomes.

I find it very unlikely that the average person will be creating a series of meshed "small world" channels, and even if they did, it does not fulfill the need of a globally distributed network required to bring about the global peer to peer currency vision of Bitcoin. What's more likely to happen in my opinion, is that centralized hubs will become the primary way in which the lightning network is utilized due to the infrastructure that will be built around them, their ability to reliably meet the on-chain fund requirements necessary to operate within the LN, and the usability/convenience advantages they will offer to the average user.

"The private keys never leave the device and the malware cannot read the private keys from TREZOR. This is thanks to the wire protocol between TREZOR and the computer, which does only transfer unsigned transactions to the device and signed ones out of the device. Also, we have implemented a safe way of entering PIN, so no keylogger can be used to spy on your PIN."
The mechanism of making transactions with TREZOR is simple as this:
1. Connect the device into the USB and run your wallet software.
2. The device is automatically recognized by your computer as a new USB device.
3. Once the wallet software asks for the master public key, it will show your addresses and their balances.
4. When you want to send some coins, your wallet software creates a template of the transaction and sends it to TREZOR.
5. TREZOR displays a transaction summary and asks you to confirm the transaction by pressing the confirmation button.
6. TREZOR signs the transaction using a private key stored in the device and sends a signed transaction to the wallet software.
7. The desktop software then sends the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network.

one of the cool things about bitcoin, is that you can play a role in making it successful. its success will in part be determined by whether there is widespread adoption leading to a large network effect  . if you believe in bitcoin, not just in the value but in the principle itself, spreading the word about its advantages and possibilities can help bring it to be successful.

from It is true that transactions can sometimes take tens of minutes to become confirmed. Despite this, retailers can accept unconfirmed transactions with very little risk by simply 'listening' on the network for a double-spend transaction, or partnering with a company that provides this service. After a head start of merely several seconds, the original transaction would reach so much of the Bitcoin network that a fraudulent double-spend transaction would almost certainly be fruitless. An attacker would have to commit easily-detectable fraud, in person, several hundred or several thousand times, before one of these low-value double-spend attempts would likely succeed.
An attacker could work around the necessity of sending out a second fraudulent transaction to the Bitcoin network by attempting to solo-mine an attack block containing the attack transaction himself - temporarily withholding the block with the rest of the network - and then execute the fraudulent purchase within seconds, or minutes at most, of mining the attack block, before broadcasting the attack block. However, the cost of such an activity would dramatically outweigh the value of anything typically offered without a confirmation wait for several reasons.
First, mining a block (attack or otherwise) entitles the miner to a valuable block reward, and because the attack involves temporarily withholding the block from the network, the attacker would put himself in the likely position of his block becoming stale, which would result in forfeiture of the entire reward. Most solo miners solve less than one block per month, so this would represent the loss of proceeds of potentially several weeks of mining.
Second, it is not possible for a solo miner to know exactly when his mining activity will yield a block, and because the attack must be carried out within seconds or minutes of successfully mining a block, the attacker will not be able to know or plan in advance the brief window when the attack would be likely to succeed. While it may be easy for a determined attacker to get low-value items that are sold and delivered online instantly without waiting for confirmations (such as downloads), this unpredictability and the briefness of the opportunity would make it extremely difficult to commit any kind of fraud where real-life interaction is required, such as visiting a merchant or taking possession of goods. Petty shoplifting would be far simpler. Even if an attacker went forward with this attack, the retailer would be notified of the fraud the moment the attack block is released seconds later.
In short, the 10-minute wait for confirmation is only practically necessary when delivering goods of value that significantly exceed the block reward an attacker would have to risk to perform an attack and where recourse after delivery is practically nonexistent, such as money transfers.

there is good reason to have concern over a cashless society, however those concerns are really only if the currency was controlled by government...which is not the case with bitcoin. there's an overwhelming amount of statements, documents and policy papers outline plans for a one world government / currency. such a further centralization of control combined with the erosion of liberty, would likely lead to a despotic form of technocratic neofeudalism. so in actuality, bitcoin's decentralized structure is likely going to be an escape out of the system she's concerned about.

I was thinking of this as well and I agree. People need a way to easily converse about the amount in which they'll primarily be acting and buying in. There needs to be a name for "the buck". People's frame of reference is largely from $1, then up....from low to high, with 1 being "the unit". With bitcoin, it's going to work in reverse in most cases, starting with 1 (unit) and going lower into fractions of that unit. These fractions are going to be what people operate in. A common language adoption is going to be very important in more widespread usage/payment adoption.

i think some other cryptos have value. litecoin just isn't one of them, for many reasons - a lot of which were nicely summarized here  
my hope is to see the end of our neofeudalistic central banking structure. i see cryptocurrency (on the model of bitcoin) as a way to see it through. if it's bitcoin, great. if it's not - i don't care, as long as it's something.
