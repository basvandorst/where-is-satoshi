Communism doesn't work, and it espically wont work with a digital currency like BTC.

Just think of it like the recent "crypto ruble" the Russians are making. Its literally just a 1:1 trade.

You also have to have stupid amounts of money to take advantage of the arbitrage in order to make good profits.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:53:30
im afraid I dont understand the question 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:40:26
Sathosi can do what Satoshi wants to do.
He used his blood sweat and tears to make BTC, he can hoard his billions if he wants, its his choice.
What right does anyone have to his wealth?
Spoiler alert:
No one has a right to his wealth but him, get over it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:05
You can, but, you may find it to be unprofitable  unless you have an insane amout of money to Arb with
Coupled with verification times and paper work you may lose out on profits.
But some traders still do it.
If you (somehow) make it work and make a decent profit, more power to ya, OP.

The legal way I can think of would be the US Admin to sign an executive order declaring BTC harmful to the state or "a funder of [insert America's enemy of the week] and needs to be stopped to stop them".
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:47:08
They have been doing this to PM's since the 70's so im sure they could do the same thing to BTC, somehow

The gov recognizes BTC not as a currency, but as an investment vehicle  (think stock or bond).
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:01:52
I remember that.

Its Friday
Hard Fork cancelled
And, imo, BTC needed a correction anyway.

Orginally, futures were a financial instrument that corporations used to hedge the costs of commodities that they huy and sell for their day-to-day operations.
Now, it's just a way for speculators to make a quick buck

Its a Chicago based trading hub that trades in commodities. Used, Orginally, by corporations to hedge their costs to accquire commodities for their daily operations. Now it is used by traders to speculate on the price of various commodities (like oil, wheat, corn, beef, and now BTC)
Its a stock that you can trade just like a corporate stock. Instead of it representing a share in a corporation,  it represents a share in a fund that buys assets  ( land, real estate, stocksx etc)
As for what this means for BTC, its hard to say. If anything, I'd expect big banks to abuse BTC through these futures like they abuse precious metals through futures and options.

Its called Arbitrage
Its when different exchanges have different rates for the same asset.
In theory, one can gain risk free profits by buying from one exchange and selling it in the other. Eventually both exchanges will reach an equilibrium point where prices match.

It doesn't, nothing works in communist countries.

Wew lads, looking like Wall street everyday!

Boo! Get off the stage!

Just in general, buying the All time High is never advised, even in stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:40:44
Wait for the correction. Buying now, imo, not the smartest idea.

If you dont want to switch, buy Tether instead (its literally 1:1 exchange with USD) than trade the Tether for BTC.
