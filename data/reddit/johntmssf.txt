I'm assuming that the mouse jiggler was used as a Deadman switch. While the jiggler is on the computer everything is normal. If it gets removed for ~10s then it locks down.

Look, I took your criticism seriously, I went out and searched this and researched it myself in the few spare moments I have. I even found direct quotes from Assange, conflicting quotes that to me make this a more complicated and less binary discussion. I would've loved to talk about it more with you and become more knowledgeable on the topic, but if you're just going to completely throw everything I give out without the same effort I put in - this isnt a discussion, I'm just talking to a wall. 
If you can't trust ABC or The Hill, or the Washington Post as I do as credible journalist then that is your issue and not mine. We could've at least talked about it more.

Credit where credit is due, I decided to look for some quotes. I did find this and they support your side of the argument

On the flip side, this seems to be the quote that gets people stiring:
The hill:


"I mean, it's from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks, the problem with the Trump campaign is it's actually hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump's mouth every second day," Assange said.
