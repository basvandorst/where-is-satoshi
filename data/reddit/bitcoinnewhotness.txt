Thanks for the feedback! We agree with you!
We've played around with limits on bitcoins able to be purchased, i.e.: 1-7 days of first purchase, max 1 BTC per transaction and 2 transactions 8-30 days, max 1 BTC per transaction, 4 transactions per week 31+ days, unlimited transactions, 3 BTC max per transaction
However we are still developing and playing with the idea.

Our plan is to deliver near-instantly, assuming the customer passes verification and all fraud checks.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:40:52
How much BTC are you talking about? Because we will be running an invisible service in the background, buying large amounts of BTC in order to source them for sale. As for a consumer-level, small BTC amount into fiat, unfortunately our platform wouldn't be suited to that.

Mailing list is not ready, we have to work out a couple of kinks, and a start-up accelerator is interested in us. However, if you are interested in investing, PM me, I'll keep in touch as that opens up.

Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:10:02
Great ideas. I will definitely bring these up.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:04:49
Payment Processing companies take percentages, so that is unfortunately impossible.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:43:18
Good point, we would definitely have to keep this in mind as BTC rises (it will rise) and adjust our fees accordingly.
Or sell at fiat points and the person gets the % of bitcoin that they pay for.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:48:33
It depends on the pricing structure we offer as well. We may only sell in whole Bitcoins, or .50BTC or .25BTC. It remains to be seen.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:41:03
Great! And I assume that you would be even more excited if we lowered the fees?
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:23:52
Actually, BTC-E doesn't accept Liqpay as of about a month and a half ago. Liqpay shut them down. I was using them. :(
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:47:23
You do realize credit cards charge a percentage fee, right?
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:40:25
Sketch is definitely high with BTC-e. I had funds tied up while they were being DDOS'd for a few days.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:46:20
No, I came to the Reddit community first. BTCTalk is a rough community right now, I thought I would get a more average opinion here.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:10:46
True :(
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:42:04
Great points!
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:04:14
Great points. A few thoughts-
1- Payment Processors don't like subscription models for intangible goods. Its a big sticking issue, but we will take your comments into consideration.
2- Great point. Our anti-fraud system works invisibly on a lot to ensure no account compromises and also the way we work on delivering the BTC is immune to that type of attack (don't want to reveal more until we go live with it).
3- There are far more regulations than just MSB registration. We will jump through the hoops though!
4- Definitely worth more thought. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:59:33
Would you be more interested if it was a 5% + $5 fee or something like that? Perhaps with our backing we can eat some processing fees until our processor sees that we will have low fraud.
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:59:00
The company is in the United States. It shouldn't trigger any bank issues.
@_date: 2013-05-16 06:09:38
Th next two weeks hold a lot of meetings and will determine the time frame.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:08:16
It's not security by obscurity by any means. We will be revealing more in the future.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:09:07
Also two factor authentication will be in use!
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:05:00
Credit Card transaction risk isn't in waiting for a credit transaction to "clear". A transaction can "clear" and still be charged back several months down the road.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:20:30
That is indeed the question! We believe they will happy if my company is successful in transferring the transaction risk onto us and eliminating most of the fraud. Our fees are sort of high because we are leveraging three different solutions to bring a total of 4 layers of anti-fraud into the transactions.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:40:15
Absolutely, and we would be able to sell globally.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:39:16
Awesome! Good luck on your business.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:13:26
Great words! Very good to think about.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:30:27
That's a great question. I am very confident in our method of identity verification. I can't reveal it yet, but a thief will have substantial issues to surmount to get past our anti-fraud. We have 4 layers of anti-fraud (within 2 of those are dozens of layers themselves).
We know of no other company employing a system like we have developed.
Also, we would be willing to purchase large amounts of BTC from people, we are still working on that. Probably at launch it will be selling BTC, with a high priority on adding the service of us buying BTC from customers.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:01:52
Our hope is exactly what you are saying. The average, mass-market consumer (who doesn't exist yet) who just needs $100 worth of Bitcoin for the week or something similar. Someone who spends it, not someone buying for holding. Hopefully our service would open up accessibility to Bitcoin in a large way.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:26:11
Good points. But the gamblers are not my target audience, as they are high fraud once they realize they lost $$$$'s.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:07:57
Thanks, we have a system that beats all of that.
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:19:31
Definitely a micro-layer of our anti-fraud.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:39:14
The U.S. Government is definitely confused on Bitcoins. But we are rolling with the FinCEN guidelines from March.
We are still working on the fees, for sure.
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:03:43
Yes, it will be international.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:09:30
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:35:40
Ah, I didn't see that they opened up that connection. Cool.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:39:03
That's a great idea.
We have set up a system where instead of increased/decreased fees, we set limits on bitcoins able to be purchased, i.e.:
1-7 days of first purchase, max 1 BTC per transaction and 2 transactions
8-30 days, max 1 BTC per transaction, 4 transactions per week
31+ days, unlimited transactions, 3 BTC max per transaction
However we are still developing and playing with the idea.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:09:04
Thanks for the feedback! It is aimed at a different market than Bitinstant, as you have to have cash in order to but with Bitinstant.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:07:31
Verify identity, yes, link a bank account - no.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:47:00
Which we are. There are quite a few hoops. We found a great state to work with to meet all the regulations.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:35:11
Great point. I think we will aim for a fixed percentage + small fixed fee such as 5% + $5 that was mentioned earlier. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:45:19
I apologize for not wording my phrase better, I should have said "gamblers are a high fraud risk customer target".
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:06:19
That does make sense. We'll check it out! I will keep you in mind for idea bouncing. :)
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:03:32
Yes!
