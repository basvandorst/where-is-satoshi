Incorrect.  The dollar is valued via a weighted average of other currencies.  Gold and Bitcoin are irrelevant (they are not a part of the market basket).
The USD is actually up.  When investors reduce risk they buy US Treasuries.   In order to do so they need to buy US Dollars.  This is very basic stuff.

&amp;gt;By no means am I an expert in the macro forces that are affecting the global economy
No doubt, as would be evidenced by everything else you said.
&amp;gt;China likely has a growing interest in pushing their currency as a world reserve currency
No they don't.
&amp;gt; it doesn't seem unreasonable that this could happen
Yes it does.  It is almost exactly unreasonable.  The level of reason here is very very low.  
&amp;gt;Basically as China continues to ascend as a global financial superpower
If by financial superpower you mean manufacturing superpower.  Two very different things.  
&amp;gt; it becomes more and more likely their currency could be used as a world reserve currency 
This will never happen due to a number of factors.
&amp;gt;Some people would say this is inevitable
And those people would have absolutely no fucking idea what they were talking about.
From there your argument falls over.
So why am I just trashing everything you said?  Because you couldn't even be bothered to look shit up before you start forming a hypothesis based on nothing other than laying your head on a pillow and imagining bullshit without having any fundamental knowledge with which to start.
Just fucking look up what a reserve currency is at least, before you start talking about it.
Watch fucking Wikipedia just completely dismantle your ideas:
From Wiki:
&amp;gt;A reserve currency (or anchor currency) is a currency that is held in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves
Guess what currencies those are, and guess which one isn't even close to being on that list.  Fuck it, you don't need to guess, Wiki spells it out for you with graphs
Maybe you prefer tables:
People who think the USDollar is going to shit and will be removed as a world currency?
&amp;gt;However, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the dollar’s share in the world’s foreign-exchange trades rose slightly from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013
I should just post that one thing over and over in the subreddit to get rid of all the crazy people here that don't know anything and can't be bothered to learn shit unless there's a tense musical score and a narrator stringing together an apocalyptic prophecy.
So what does Wiki have to say specifically about the Yuan being a reserve currency?
&amp;gt;The Chinese yuan or renminbi (RMB) cannot be used as a reserve currency as long as the Chinese government maintains capital controls on the conversion of its currency.[45] Holding the currency would not be attractive to central banks unless China develops a strong open bond market.[46] The Bank for International Settlements estimates that in 2010 around 0.9% of all currency market transactions were carried out in renminbi.[47]"
If you want to talk about reserve currencies then you should absolutely read up on SDRs, but I will say that we're a ways off of that and that's just a market basket of the major currencies anyway, so it's just a different way (centralized, really) of doing what is already being done through current reserves.
EDIT:  +1 LOL if you think governments will hold bitcoins as a part of their current reserves

Not sure which rates you're talking about, but this is actually the opposite of how it works.
The Fed actively reduces interest rates in order to encourage lending of more money.  They don't create more money in order to reduce interest rates.
Retail/Commercial institutions consider the time value of money, sure, but it's of little significance after they've factored in their operating costs, risk premium, etc.
Not quite sure what you're trying to get at there.
Regarding economic coordination via price, this goes back to like my first post.  If inflation was a 1:1 across the board, no one would say a damn thing about it.  But because it occurs disproportionately (my original example was in wage disparity, but this can obviously be expanded), people see the detrimental effects.
I'm not sitting here saying INFLATION IS GREAT GUYS SHUT UP LOSERS.  Or anything like that.
What I am saying, however, is that it's not the end of the world.  Does the overall economic model we employ have downsides?  Yes.  Learn to live with it, because it's brought you everything you have.
What gets me is how people in this subreddit are convinced that Bitcoin suddenly solves all of these problems.  It's almost painful.
In addition, I don't think you understand things as well as you do.  You were originally referencing capital structure, investors, and interest rates.  That is why I went on to the markets and talked about how the Fed actively pushes investors out of treasuries in order to spur on economic growth.  You do understand that capital structure is merely a debt/equity ratio, right?  The bond markets being the markets for debt, the equities markets being...well..that's pretty obvious right?

No, I'm not missing the biggest problem.  I was responding directly to a post about inflation specifically.
You come in pulling the old conspiracy switcharoo. It's not inflation that's the problem, it's now the structure of production!
The Fed uses interest rates (and QE as well) to steer the economy.  That's their job.  They are not "distorting" or "fooling" anyone, except maybe people that don't understand basic macro policy?
It's not a distortion that the major market indexes are constantly pushing new highs.  It's a result of investors seeking higher returns because the Fed is actively pushing down bond yields.  This isn't distortion or foolery.  This is their mandate.  Everybody knows this, except maybe you just learned it from a youtube video with scary music int he background and Glenn Beck walking from side to side with a helmet on and a Nazi flag?

You are incredibly hard to have a conversation with.  You use a lot of terminology incorrectly.
Capital Structure is a finance term, so yeah I used it as a finance term.  Yet what you're apparently talking about is the allocation of factors of production.  You first introduced the term in the same breath as talking about interest rates and investors.  So given the context I actually thought what you meant was obvious.  But apparently you didn't mean what I thought you did so yeah, it's *my* fault for talking about investments in debt and equity markets as a result of Fed intervention via interest rates given the terminology and context.  I think I've done a remarkable job trying to have a conversation with you.
Everything you say is ambiguous, too.  I honestly wonder if you have a flying fucking clue what you are talking about.  Next time you use the phrase "interest rates" specify what rates you're talking about.  Because apparently you are talking about different ones than I am.

For the past 100 years?  Inflation is a tool of the federal reserve, it's not this horrible doomsday device that it is so often portrayed as in circles like the Gold and Bitcoin club of fanatics.
Moderated inflation is incredibly useful.  The problem everyone sees in their personal lives is that the ratio of inflation occurs disproportionately in their day to day finance via wage disparity.  No one would have shit to say about inflation if we inflated 10% Year over Year and so did everyones paycheck.  But since it's not, it is held up as the culprit.  That's just not the case.
US inflation is actually below the targeted level.  What happened last CPI release?  Inflation was higher than expected.  This must be terrible, right?... and yet the dollar rallied.
We have the world's reserve currency for a reason.  And let me further add that if the US Dollar did suddenly implode your bitcoins would be worth fuck all because we'd be busy killing each other for food.  So you better damn well pray that the dollar continues to hold its place in the global economy or you're just as fucked as the next guy.

You actually haven't.  Or at least not in the way you think you have.
You said that the manipulation of interest rates (this is not direct inflation) distorts capital structure.  Then you re-iterated that you were talking about inflation, so inflation distorts capital structure.  And that this distortion "fools" the market into misappropriating assets and causing crisis. 
I'm just not getting your point here, apparently.  Everything you said is massively generic.  You couldn't be more vague if you were trying.
EDIT:  Is your point that inflation is a tool to create the boom/bust cycle?  And that booms/busts are bad or something?

Oh really.  I'm not going to say your point is wholly without merit, but the brush you applied with that statement is a bit excessive.
Volatility is a natural component of all markets, it has nothing to do with exchanges.  Supply and demand curves shift constantly at every time scale.  If anything, exchanges help establish equilibrium.
While there may be some uncertainty or lack of trust in the current exchanges themselves and it may indeed have an additional weight on volatility levels, it is not remotely the prime suspect nor is it going away.  It doesn't matter how perfect they become my above paragraph will always be true.  For additional references see any market index ever.

When it comes to Treasury issued bailouts it is first important to recognize that these bailouts were voted into law by Congress.  They weren't just executive orders or some shadowy figure in the background pulling strings.  Taxpayers had their normal influence here.
The most notable was the EESA which is what everyone calls TARP.  The Treasury puts out figures on this constantly and all you have to do is google "TARP TRACKER" and [here's what you get](  Please note that the Toxic Assets provision of the EESA accounts for a very small percentage of the total bailout package.  If it is surprising to you that this information is provided publicly by the Treasury, and done so in such a very nice way, then you have lived for far too long in a world of skewed ideology where the government is evil and we're fighting for our rights or whatever you kids are into these days.  They work for us.
Now the EESA was obviously the most significant bailout, but there was also a specific rescue of FHLMC and FNMA via the HERA.  Personally, I like [ProPublica's breakdown of the bailouts through the Treasury](  There are some differences in the overall figures, and that's a discussion that is kind of worth having, but the overall point you should takeaway from this is exactly what I said in my previous post.
Now what usually happens at this point is someone brings up the Federal Reserve as if QE and TARP are the same thing.  So now I'm just waiting.

It's really not even a question of legitimacy.  It's a question of utility.
The average US consumer will gain precisely zero advantages from using bitcoin and receive all of the negatives.  The average American has no reason to convert to and from a secondary currency when they could use their primary currency in the first place.  In addition they have the burden of adopting a new technology, and if you don't think that's a big deal - trade phones with an average joe and see how many questions he asks and how pissed off he gets.
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:36:59


That was my point.  I was being sarcastic, though.  The correct response is really that the analogy ties in perfectly if you're looking at it from a backbone perspective.  It's not important for retail consumers (or even retail commerce) to adopt bitcoin.  Using it for interbank transfers and settlement between payment processors is where it should gain its most major foothold.
Much like how Windows (Fiat) has a stranglehold on the consumer market, it doesn't matter because the infrastructure is unix based.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:57:03
This has always been my stance.  I think the transaction network portion of bitcoin is very valuable (not only as a settlement network in the financial industry, but in many industries it could be re-purposed easily).
The problem in this sub has always been that it's filled with highschool/college kids that have been cajoled into a neo-libertarian view on complex subjects like economics after watching scary youtube videos.  Decrying fiat currency, doom and glooming the modern financial system, and reposting quotes from 200 years ago that are hardly applicable today (unless you subscribe to horoscope type ideology that is so vague it's almost meaningless).  Then the citations of so-called experts who have a vested interest (people that would, in any other sub, be called Shills).  
It's just disturbing.  The blockchain technology should be constantly evolving and modified for other purposes.  But it's not.  It's just turned into a virtual currency that is absolutely useless for anyone in the US and a lot of other western countries.  Then the counter arguments to my last sentence come from the &lt;1% of people that regularly wire money internationally out of their personal bank account, or some other obscure group of statistical outliers.  It's fucking retarded in this sub sometimes.

So crap like this is why I still pay attention to bitcoin because of the nonsense you people spew.  It's like russian political propaganda sometimes.


The entire world you live in, every luxury you have, you owe to the current system.


These are largely going away (check out Zelle, Paypal, etc.)  But bitcoin also has fees, and once all coins have been mined those fees will have to increase to cover the costs of miners processing transactions.  So your point is moot and old and wrong.


Let me know when you find a service that costs money to operate but operates freely out of the kindness of its heart covering all of its costs internally through some charitable endeavor.  P. S., see point above, bitcoin isn't free either.


99% of all bank accounts are free if you have a qualifying direct deposit.


This doesn't actually happen, this is a problem you're making up.  You can easily ignore any solicitations like a normal person.


This is basically how things work.


This is how things work now, I don't see what your problem is.  If you're sending tens of thousands of dollars internationally - then yeah, there's a real concern.  We should be watching you.  What the fuck are you doing.

@_date: 2019-11-26 19:03:59
So let's quickly set aside two things:
1) This video provides no actual value as it simply contains the text of [a blog article]( laid out to music over time.  Videos like this are actually cancerous.  Just link the article(s).
2) There is no actual structure or point.  It is simply an enumeration of the bullet points, most of which are feeding you conclusions based on erroneous premises, without some of the other material from the article.
So, let's go through them.


[Citation Needed] - This headline has absolutely no substance to it because it is entirely unsupported.  It is simply a claim with no evidence.  Future bullets attempt to substantiate it and fail to do so.


This is a flimsy attempt to substantiate the previous bullet point.  Describing this as flimsy is me being generous.
I actually read [this report]( and it is questionable at best - full of shit from top to bottom at worst.  There are actually much more useful items in this report that could have been pulled, but the relevant section regarding millenials' trust in fiat is a very minor side note halfway in.  Their only source for coming to this conclusion is a garbage survey - "Blockchain Capital Survey" which can be found [here](  Surveys, in general, are bad sources of sample data.  Reliance solely on surveys is a terrible way to form conclusions.  Doubly so for volunteer surveys, which is what this is.  This is literally the worst form of sample data you can use in research.  They teach you this in business statistics which is an entry level class in freshman years of college.


This is such an important one for me.  Becuase the conclusion was reached for you.  It's important to distinguish between confidence in the concept of fiat currency and confidence in those individual countries and their ability to manage their economies.  These countries are never listed because once you actually look at which countries they are it becomes clear what the actual problem is (hint: it's not the actual concept of fiat currency):
The list of all countries undergoing hypreinflation, having reached a significant peak of hyperinflation and currently on a decline, or at risk of being considered hyperinflationary (2018-2019):
North Korea
Do I really need to explain what the real important similarities of the countries in this list are?
Anyway, this has been a problem forever.  These countries are either:  1) taken advantage of by the countries the rest of us live in (we convince them to borrow money, creating loans they can't repay - forcing them to inflate like crazy) or 2) milked by corrupt leadership


This sentence is written in a retarded way which leads me to believe it was auto generated.  I think it intends to say that the crypotcurrency world experienced a surge in market cap across the board at the same time searches for related terms increased.
Wow, no shit.  I don't need anyone to point out to me that sales of the new iPhone increased while, coincidentally, searches for the new iPhone increased.


So, just from a continuity perspective shouldn't this bullet point have come before the last one?  This is basically a restatement of that one, while adding in the report from the World Gold Council which doesn't even agree.  Their report literally says ["Attitudes towards gold are (mostly)
stable across generations"]( and it makes no statements about crypto at all.  The WGC report says things that are obvious and known and have been true forever.  Most people believe gold to be a stable store of value long term when compared to fiat currency itself.  This is, of course true, it has been true since the elimination of the gold standard, and it is true ON PURPOSE.  The whole point is to force people to spend money and create economic activity. That is literaly the reason we inflate fiat currency supply.  Anything is a better investment than sticking cash under your mattress, but gold has always been the go-to.  No shit.


Quite literally no new information, just restating and trying to maintain a tight coupling of things that are not actually really directly related.


So, there are a number of things wrong here.
1) No one "invests" in fiat currency.  The closest you will come is buying national debt through instruments like treasury bonds.  So every time you see "alternative investment to fiat currency" you should - as a reader - get very upset.  Because that's not even a real thing.  You do not invest in fiat currencies.  You invest in stocks, bonds or assets/commodities. If you are doing anything else you are not investing.  You are trading or gambling.  That includes FOREX (forex is literally legalized gambling and the only thing one could argue is a means to "invest" in fiat).
2) There is absolutely no evidence provided to support the statement that "news of the collapse of several country currencies" was the reason for an increase in "search for alternative investments to fiat currencies"
No data was provided to show that on DayX-1 the search rate for crypto investment terms was low and then on DayX (the day the news broke) the search rate suddenly spiked. There's no data to prove the prescribed correlation, let alone causation.
3) The day before any particular news article trending up regarding economic collapse or hyperinflation in some third world country the search rate would have to be significantly lower than the day of the release of such a news article.  There are so many other variables in here that even if data could be presented to try and support this, it would have to be scrutinized significantly as anyone could proclaim some precipitating factor that resulted in such a surge in search activity. As you see often in this article and subreddit.


I don't care, personally.  If I did I would look for significant support for this statement rather than just relying on a proclamation from some youtube video.  I'm also granting the premise that the "overall interest" is increasing.  I don't know what "overall interest" really means, but hey, I think we can all just go with the idea that more people are searching for Bitcoin today versus 5 years ago.


This doesn't even make sense because it's talking about purchasing power and then it's talking about investment.  Those are two completely different things.  You either Consume or Invest.  Purchasing power is related to consumption.  If you are "investing" in cryptocurrency - you aren't consuming.  If you are using cryptocurrency to buy things, then you are still subject to the exact same purchase power dynamics.  Trading dollars for bitcoin and then buying stuff with bitcoin didn't magically remove it.
I am fairly confident this article was written by a computer.


No it doesn't.  It doesn't "say a lot" about anything.  It just says there's a growing interest in cryptocurrency.  That's all that says.  AND I'm granting the premise just so we can move to the conclusion.  Do you see how this conclusion is just made for you?  It's made for people who already agree with it.  This is a literal example of propaganda.


I agree.  And also this sentence was definitely written by a computer.

I'm not sure why but a moderator removed your initial post there.  This subreddit is jacked as I was looking forward to going through some of those points in detail.
I'll try to simplify because I do think that deserves a real response but I want to be somewhat careful so it requires some effort here.
One of the first things I would say is that it's not particularly a great idea to just cut and paste someone elses summary as a response to one specific point.  Because what it does is enumerate a ton of arguments I never made, and in doing so it gives itself unfounded weight to other readers.  
Several of the points that are made are attacks against straw men.  Arguments I never made, and a presentation of what "common" arguments might be, which you have to agree to as a premise - and I do not agree.  The major ones against points I actually did make start by conceding my central point and then sidestepping the concession into an unproved/unfounded "long-term" view that is purely theoretical and attempts to trivialize the significance and impact of deflation, as if to say that deflationary spirals aren't real and/or work themselves out in the long run to a greater end.  I also find it really difficult to alleviate the cognitive dissonance inherent in the concession that consumption decreases yet somehow aggregate demand is unaffected or improves.  
I get that mises promotes austrian philosophy like a religion, but it seems to promote a lot of dangerous argumentation in the process which gives voice to ideas that have no real basis.

There are a gajillion other alternatives.  You named one, because you don't invest in fiat so gold is the only one that makese sense.
When it comes to alternatives, or "options" as most people express investments to be, there are literally millions of options.  Your inability to name them doesn't suddenly make them go away.  Index funds, hedge funds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, fuckin junk bonds, treasuries, a litany of commodities, the list is endless.  The list is so diverse that it's possible to diversify your investments across every economic sector in existence.
The article you link highlights the problem with bitcoiners and I've touched on this before.
You confuse purchasing power and return on investment.  You think they are the same thing or that they should be the same - They Are Not.  Matter of fact they are diametrically opposed in that one is the opportunity cost of the other.
If you want to invest for a future return to grow wealth over time, then you *trade your currency* for stocks/bonds/commodities/etc. 
 There are tons of markets to transact in for these purposes and a myriad of asset classes to investigate and build a portfolio to ensure that 20 years from now your wealth has not been inflated away.
Absolutely zero people think that currency itself is an investment.  Zero.  Because it's not designed to be. That is literally not how a system of growth works and it is not the purpose of currency.
That article lists "scarcity" as a primary attribute of money.  You do not want scarce money.  That is bad.  Money needs to be readily available, in abundance, to ensure liquid markets.  Otherwise you have people holding on to the limited amount of currency available and not transacting, which creates deflation.  The whole goal is to get people to spend money, not sit on it.  It's not doing any good if you're not fucking using it to participate in markets and exchange goods and services.  That is its entire purpose.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:14:40
Putting money in a savings account is just a different way of spending it.  It is not the same as just sticking it under a mattress.  You are using it to fund other investments and gaining a return on it.  You are putting your money to work (putting it into the system, for use in transactions). That is how savings accounts work.

What?  It's an overnight market banks use to balance their books.  Those with a surplus put cash into the market to buy short term bonds and gain interest on them when they are bought back by the initial seller.  The seller sold them because they were at a deficit and needed to balance to even.  The fed has a chair in this market to offset any disparity in the overall balancing of many institutions.  So if too many sellers show up looking for cash to fill their reserves, the fed will fill any remaining offers after all the buying institutions are filled.  So they buy the remaining offered assets and sell them back later when those institutions have gone back to a surplus (often the next day or two, sometimes a week).  If too many buyers show up looking to earn interest on their excess reserves by buying bonds, the fed offers assets to those who have bids unfilled.  
This happens every single day. 
This is what happens when you give regular people a little bit of knowledge.  You people are just straight up dangerous.  You walk around all arrogant thinking you understand the nuances of day to day operations for massive corporations.  That you are somehow keenly woke and in tune with the fine mechanics of the world.  It is disgusting and shameful to be so arrogant while being just plain ignorant.

That's a really weird way to look at it.  What all you mooners should do is use annual lows to demonstrate an upward trend.    2017 - \~700, 2018 - \~3k, 2019 - \~6500.  No mental gymnastics required.

We have used inflation to encourage economic growth for far longer than 30 years.  There isn't a person alive on this planet that lived through anything else.  The system we have now is the system we have had since 1900.

Questioning is great.  But when you do it from a narrow perspective filled with preconceived notions you force a conclusion that is less likely to reflect an objective take on reality.
For example, 'throwing the average worker overboard 50 years ago.'  Right?  There are a lot of ways to support that as a valid perspective.  Especially if you are searching for information that is specifically aimed at supporting that perspective.  However, there are a lot of ways to look at how the world has changed over the past 50 years.  Globalization is a thing.  Economies of scale.  Obvious capitalist motivations.  The idea that most jobs are actually not hard and can be done by just about anybody.  The idea that most people that complain aggressively about this topic tend to be on the left side of the bell curve, relatively uneducated, relatively unskilled, and oddly entitled at the same time.
The world is complicated.  It's not purposefully obtuse.  Cell phones are complicated and the knowledge and understanding you would need to create one from scratch on your own is almost guaranteed to be beyond you.  Why would the entire world we live in and the systems that govern our day to day be any less complicated than that?

I appreciate that you actually asked.  Curiosity is a wonderful thing and you seem really open to real learning.  If these things genuinely interest you I would suggest a few things:
1)  There are some decent youtube channels that discuss concepts within monetary policy, interbank lending, banking and finance operations, etc.  I would point to MarketplaceAPM and branch out to related videos there.
2)  When you are on youtube, or the internet in general, be keenly aware of when you are being manipulated.  If you are watching a video that is explaining how financial systems work over a dark orchestral score (or any music really) - you are not learning - you are being manipulated.  
3)  Stay off of this subreddit.  It is filled with cancerous pseudo-intellectual conspiracy mongers that don't realize they have been entirely informed by  above.  You are not going to learn a whole lot of actual facts from those people.  Also avoid anyone that gets really emotionally engaged when they say something like "fractional reserve banking" or generally speaks about these topics derisively.    
Just notice how much bullshit there is in this subreddit and its all informed by fear mongering, highly charged rhetoric, and a poor relationship with inductive and deductive reasoning (these topics are actually the first place anyone should start if they are not familiar).  I'm not suggesting to run away from bitcoin, just the bitcoiners.  
Best wishes on your journey

A 20 year run of prosperity had faded into dust.  Tremors surrounded the US economy as it was quickly losing its stranglehold on the rest of the world.  Foreign countries, many of which were allies, were tired of paying for the luxurious life of the average American while their own citizens toiled in labor for nothing.  Coupled with the dramatic cost of the bloodiest war in American history, the country was in a dire situation.  America started losing significant ground in the world economy as Allies turned inward to provide for themselves and consumed less American goods.  Debt holders became increasingly concerned that they were funding a failing enterprise as industries started to move overseas.  Still eyeing the explosion in debt from Vietnam, something had to be done soon before inflation inevitably got out of control.
Nixon, entirely on his own without any advice from experts, said "fuck that guy over there" and imposed a 90 day wage and price freeze.  Because he hated that guy.  He also said that he realized the dollar was way overvalued when he was reading the ingredients of the shampoo bottle while taking a shit that morning.  So he declared " and fuck gold too!"  And thus he became known as the only American President with the balls to say "Fuck that guy and fuck gold too!"
And then the 80s were amazing.  The end.
History can support any narrative you want it to.

\&gt; How is the global economy going to experience a soft landing from the continued lowering of interest rates?
That's a really good question.  The answer relies on a number of things, but I will focus on two of them.
1. Reliance on accepting the idea that interest rates have done nothing but go down
In reality, interest rates are all over the place.  They go up and down. The analogy is that when you are driving a car down a road, you are never actually going straight.  You are actually going slightly left and then slightly right and the overall result of that appears to be straight.  If you laid a perfectly straight hair on the road and zoomed in on that hair while tracking the vehicle, it would look wildly erratic in terms of the cars shifting direction to maintain a parallel direction to the hair.  This is generally what it looks like when you zoom in on the levers we use to mitigate the extremes of the business cycle via interest rate policy.
2.  Reliance on belief that the market is dramatically overheated
This is the notion that you can identify exactly where you are in a cycle.  Malinvestment phases can last decades.  It's very easy to find a wide range of opinions from economists of every strip on where we currently are and whether we are in a bubble and, even moreso, whether that bubble is about to burst.
\&gt; This means, if youre in your 40s, youve never understood real estate as being a bad investment.
I think a large section of buyers from the early 00s would disagree with you here, as well as people who were cashing in on overblown equity and re-leveraging their house in the form of a credit card.  Though the irony is that I am providing you with an extra argument that I now have to poke holes in as real estate has never been a bad investment itself, however a standard mortgage contract might not have been the optimal vehicle based on the availability of credit and the local market itself.  As with anything in real estate, it's all about location.  There were plenty of places around the US that saw lots of activity in real estate even at the peak of stagflation with 15+% interest rates.
\&gt;  you’re still in the same boat as us so-called losers heading down the same shit course.
We are definitely in the same boat, though the fundamental difference is the perception of the course we are on.  You think it's shit.  I think it's fascinating and that I would enjoy it more if there were less of you.
\&gt; people rightfully have a huge distrust of the government and financial institutions
I disagree with you here.  I would like that to be true.  I really would.  But most people have a "huge distrust of the government and financial institutions" solely out of ignorance and misinformation.  I don't think it's right that even if we come to the same conclusion that it doesn't matter how we arrived at it.  If your logic is full of holes and your analysis is flawed, you should be corrected.
\&gt; one of the last bastions of free discourse people have with one another
You are definitely myopic if you believe that conversations on reddit aren't highly polarized and censored.  The very existence of the term "astroturfing" should make you rethink your view here.
EDIT: One last thing I will point out is that the "doom and gloom" sectors of financial discussion are comprised of two groups of people.
Poor people buying
Rich people selling
It is no different than anything else.  It is manipulation of people at a base level for personal gain.  It is even more valuable to the seller if they can employ 'astroturfing' as it encourages echo chambers amongst the buyers that keeps them all coming back and grows the consumer base automatically.  This is a huge boon for anyone who makes money selling "END THE FED, CENTRAL BANKING IS A SCAM, YOU ARE ALL BEING PREYED UPON" type stuff.

I'm not entirely sure why this was downvoted, but if you take a minute and look at it.  The ringgit was worth .34 USD  at its peak in 2011 and is now worth roughly .24 USD.  That is a pretty substantial loss over the past 7-8 years.  However, the rate has been pretty stable for the past 4 years.  The range over the last 4 years has been .22-.26 USD.  That is the definition of stability relative to bitcoins movements.
This is the weird thing about bitcoiners.  They see a 30% drop from 10 years ago and think that's super significant but when that happens to bitcoin it's not an issue?  Bitcoin is even more violent than that.  Bitcoin WISHES it had the stability of the MYR.  Swings within a 16% range over the last 4 years...don't you wish you could rely on btc holding its value that well?

First of all, there will be a point where Bitcoin itself provides no incentive to yield continued consensus building.  So your point is, at best, moot.  
Second of all, who says there can't be a different incentive, or unit of account for that matter?  If I implemented bitcoin to use a different unit of account, a unit agreed upon by either the companies that comprise my industry, my business partners, or the government, then who's to say the incentive cannot be externalized?

Take an econ class.  The fed sets monetary policy.  It's not stamped in a bill and passed through congress for the presidents signature.  FOMC meetings don't happen for no reason, and they certainly don't include congressional input.

It doesn't even matter.  The primary points regarding inflation and loose monetary policy are undeniably contrary to predictions by people who watch youtube videos and think they're informed by the echo chambers they subscribe to.
That quoted section is fucking spot on, though.  The USD has been doing the exact opposite of collapsing, soaring and setting records that span decades.
