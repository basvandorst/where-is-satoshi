It depends on which made up internet money you are offering. It should be relevant to what bridges do, which is to “connect” things. And it should somehow communicate that it is made up internet money not paper money so I’d like an “e” or “i” or “bit” in the name too.

A gold standard essentially means the supply of money is determined by how much gold your country can manage to hoard.  Thus the money supply of any country is going to be controlled by "Gold Produced (Mined) + Gold Imported - Gold Exported/Used". This is a silly way of controlling the money supply... The supply will expand when more gold is found and contract when more gold is used/exported. If you don't trust the federal reserve to manage the supply of money... why do you trust gold miners?


If every country is on a gold standard then every country has, in effect, pegged the price of their currency at a set rate to every other currency. This peg is a form of currency manipulation. Free floating exchange rates between currencies let them find their true value.

This is completely backward. Let's say that everyone thought that $100 was backed by 1oz of gold and that 1oz of gold should buy 100 potatoes. We then find out that our pernicious central bank has secretly been printing money such that now $100 is only backed by 0.1 oz of gold.  What should the price of 100 potatoes be in this system? Presumably, they are still worth 1oz of gold; therefore we need $1000 to buy 100 potatoes. We've had 10x inflation and have essentially added a zero to our currency. We have now wiped out the value of everyone's savings account with our profligate money printing. 
The reality of the great depression is that we had massive *deflation* not *inflation*. So it is really hard to say that we went off the gold standard because "more money was printed than there existed gold in reserve." If what you are proposing was truly the case we would have seen inflation. 
Here are some historical inflation data for the us.  
Finally, a quick historical note -- the US, UK, Germany, France, and Japan were all on the gold standard at the time of the great depression and each exited after the start of the depression.
Currency pegs are stupid. You shouldn't need economic timebomb to keep your politicians from spending too much money. Stop electing morons that tax in unreasonable ways and spend money on stupid shit instead of investing back in the people.

Because fuck clickbait?

You do realize that the first countries to *temporarily suspend* the gold standard were the first ones to emerge from the depression right? And that central banks raised interest rates during a recession in order to defend their gold reserves ? There is a reason we don’t have a gold standard anymore and it is because currency pegs do a lot more harm than good. They might constrain a countries desire to print more money ( although the country can always just stop respecting the peg) but they also have a habit of inducing painful deflation when the peg values the currency at artificially high levels compared to the nation’s underlying economic output.

I hate this circle jerking about the gold standard. That shit caused the Great Depression and thus probably WW2. Deflation is brutal. Bitcoin is good because it provides a censorship resistant store of wealth. The deflationary aspect is more likely to hinder it as a currency than help it.

Oh. I accidentally looked at the subscription one for Reddit gold rather than the one time purchase. Makes sense why that wouldn't work.

A quick point here. Negative nominal interest rates (not real rates, but nominal) don't make sense for the lender even in a deflationary environment.  
*Scenario 1: Deflation is 10%/year. Keep 1btc. Lend none. After 1 year you have 1 btc.  
*Scenario 2: Deflation is 10%/year. Lend 1 btc. Ask for 0.95 btc in return. You have more buying power than you did a year ago... but you still only have 0.95 instead of 1 btc. 
From this we see that the minimum real interest rate on loans = 0% nominal rate + (deflation rate). If deflation rates are high, loans are likely to be quite costly unfortunately.

The net effect of this is something that I worry about in terms of the adoption and overall economic utility of bitcoin and crypto in general -- high deflation rates make borrowing punishingly expensive. Do you or does anyone know of people who have thought about this problem and how to circumvent it?

Assuming your wages in terms of buying power stay constant. If it takes 1 month of wages in year 1 to earn 1 BTC at the beginning of the loan and 1.5 months of wages to earn 1 btc in year 2 at the end of the loan, you've effectively had a 50% real interest rate. 
The deflationary stuff matters based on buying power, not price relative to fiat currency. 
By your logic nobody should care about inflation because everything happens in [ insert local currency here ]. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:47:38
Presumably yes, but no lender in their right mind will ever go below a nominal interest rate of 0%, for the reason I gave above.  So, if the deflation rate is 20%/year, the lowest nominal interest rate you'll get is 0%, meaning the lowest real interest rate you'll get is 20%. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:27:19
If the deflation rate is ~10 or 20%/ year in bitcoin, then the real interest rate with be 10 to 20%. That is really really high for investment debt.

If I had the balls, I'd short GBTC. Eventually, and I bet pretty soon, some ETF will come out that actually appropriately tracks Bitcoin prices. Short GBTC, Hold an equivalent amount of BTC  ---&gt; profit.

If anyone wants some more info on politically moviated central bank fuckery in the eurozone, this is a good book I read:

I personally like BTFD ( buy the failed dip or buy the fucking dip )
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:39:00
Buy that from Gemini or at Least GDAX! Lower fees dude
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:55:30
If you buy on GDAX you're basically using coinbase with lower fees
