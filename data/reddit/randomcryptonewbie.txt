[On the Difficulty of Hiding the Balance of Lightning Network Channels](
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:25:12


There is no such thing as perfect fee prediction, only fee estimation, since we can't know the future. Now, why would wallets, built by actual developers instead of armchair redditors, make users pay higher fees than you think are necessary?
The answer is simple: if they sent out transactions with lower fees, they might be stuck for months and users would just go find a new wallet.
Now, why would wallets seemingly consistently set higher fees than mempool explorers like the one you linked to? The answer is simple: the mempool explorer has nothing to lose by displaying a lower fee, since it's not a wallet. It's not going to lose users if it predicts a fee that's a tiny bit too low in a period of congestion.
No one's being suckered here. High and unpredictable fees are part of Bitcoin's design and necessary for its long-term survival.

If you use your own nodes to send money to yourself then what you're describing isn't the LN, it's a mixer...with yourself. Mixers aren't great for privacy even with larger anonymity sets; with an anonymity set of 1 they're even worse than useless.

There's no such thing as spam. Any transaction that pays a fee and is otherwise valid isn't spam, by definition.
You can't set a minimum in-protocol fee (though you can set a minimum fee for which nodes _by default_ won't relay transactions, but this in no way prevents transactions from just being sent directly to miners or nodes changing their defaults). Miners can just refund those fees out-of-band.
If miners want to congest the chain, they can just mine empty blocks, or include transactions to themselves. Neither of those things involve sending transactions with fees to the mempool, hence why the whole "we're getting spammed!!1!" fiasco was nothing more than propaganda. There's no such thing as spam.

LN uses onion routing for transactions, so nodes don't know the sender or receiver of transactions. Assuming this is implemented correctly, this gives us a measure of privacy, but makes it impossible to determine the number of transactions going through the network. The only thing you'd know is how many transactions your own node has routed successfully, but since sender and receiver are hidden these could be "spam" transactions just cycling money to the same person this wouldn't be a meaningful number.
Anyone who tells you that a large number of off-chain transactions are definitively currently happening is pulling that out of their ass.
@_date: 2019-03-31 15:28:04
With a centralized pool, I don't think so, since we don't have access to all the shares that went towards a mined block and shares don't really have a concept of digital signatures.
That doesn't mean it can never be done, however. Case in point: p2pool.

_Hashers_ is the term I've heard when referring to what you call _miners_, to make the distinction clear. Hashers don't run nodes but miners usually do (for their own benefit: they don't want to trust other miners to provide them with the UTXO set they need to validate blocks).


To the best of our knowledge, this is correct.




). I wonder how the network will detect this, given that a longer chain is supposed to be considered as genuine.
You're correct! The problem is the multiple-use of the term "double-spending." Nakamoto consensus solves the double-spending problem (in the sense that the same digital coin can't be spent twice) since the blockchain defines a total ordering of transactions, effectively acting as a timestamping sever for transactions. This allows us to know, within a single blockchain, which transaction "came first."
"Double-spending" however can also refer to spending a coin to get something from a merchant (outside the blockchain), then _reverting_ that payment on the blockchain by making a new transaction sending the coin to a different address (the attacker's own address, usually). In this case, the blockchain is consistent and does not see a double-spend (i.e. two transactions spending the same coin)! This form of double-spending can either be done with 0-conf transactions, or through a chain re-organization. The latter case is where 51% attacks come in: a majority of miners can create a new "longer chain" that contains a double-spend transaction (by the definition in this paragraph, not the previous).
Note that a shallow re-organization (say, &lt;3 blocks) cannot really be detected as an "attack" on the network. Shallow reorgs happen all the time.
So Antonopoulos seems to be confusing two distinct form of double-spending, hence your own confusion. His public talks aren't the best place to learn technical details, he tends to over-generalize, mis-characterize, and exaggerate a lot of things for inspirational value to please the crowd. His private vlogs are a little better in this regard.

@_date: 2019-03-18 13:49:19
Yes, indeed they can. An adversary can place a large number of well-connected nodes around the network and build statistical models based on failure rates of who is sending payments to whom, for how much. This will be made _worse_ with AMP payments.
Channel states are not public, that would make the network unscalable from the get-go if all updates needed to be communicated across the network (quadratic communication costs). On the other hand, the communication costs of having to query for available paths over and over should end up being close to just as bad, in my opinion.

This is only for UTXOs already in segwit addresses. Additionally, while it is cheaper to use segwit than not, once your UTXOs are already in segwit addresses there's no incentive to consolidate them, as that costs money.
The OP is rightly inquiring about a subsidy for "good" behavior w.r.t. UTXO set growth. Segwit does nothing for that.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:42:43
It is possible. Ethereum does this by reducing gas costs for freeing up state or re-usuing the same state instead of using new state. But Ethereum meters their transactions by opcode usage.
There's no reason metering can't be added to Bitcoin. This metering could include logic to handle cases of transactions either increasing or decreasing the UTXO set. The consensus rules do not enforce that costs must be paid per byte. They can instead be calculated per Script opcode. This can be enforced with a soft-fork (potentially UASF).
Addendum: consolidating UTXOs hurts privacy in the naive case. Chain analysis tools (like the ones developed by BitFury) can pretty much trace everything anyways.

Not epic at all? A lightning node is useless without funds. At least if they ran Bitcoin Core they'd be arguably helping the network a bit.
@_date: 2019-08-09 17:55:05


What would you do after that? If everyone who disagrees with the devs decides to stop running their code, then everyone on the Bitcoin network by definition agrees with the devs.
Would you run a different client, with different rules? The only way to ensure separation of chains would be to hardfork off. Would you call this fork the real Bitcoin, or something else?

The premise we're talking about about is that the devs are trying "to implement an unpopular change". So the devs would not be on our side in this scenario.


Actually, we wouldn't. Suppose that the devs decide to implement a blocksize increase as a softfork, and get the miners on their side. In that case, your old node will follow the longest chain, and see it as valid. But that longest chain will have a larger blocksize! Now what if, instead of "blocksize increase" they do a "block reward increase"?


Cool. If we have such a system, and it's incorruptible, why do we need Bitcoin again?

Well, you _shouldn't_ reuse an address more than once, but you _can_ if you want to. The answer to the question I think you wanted to ask, but couldn't articulate, can be found here:

How totally unbiased!
@_date: 2019-05-02 03:22:24
It's important to use correct terminology please. Bitcoin and Ethereum really don't differ that much in how they handle blockchain size (history). The real difference comes in how they handle _state_. The Bitcoin UTXO set is a flat key-value map essentially. The Ethereum state is hierarchical: each account has both a balance and its own state. This hierarchy causes all the problems.
The reason you need a good SSD to sync and Ethereum node but not a Bitcoin node has nothing to do with chain size (in fact, the Ethereum blockchain is currently only about as big as the Bitcoin blockchain!). It has everything to do with the state size. Bitcoin's UTXO set is &lt;2GB last I checked, while Ethereum's is somewhere around 40GB. This means you won't be able to fit the whole Ethereum state in RAM, but instead have to go to disk (or rather, drive, since you'd be using an SSD). If you know anything about how modern computers work, going to disk is a big no-no when it comes to performance.


To conclude, this is absurdly grossly factually incorrect. Even 100MB blocks on Bitcoin wouldn't be a problem for a modern $1000 machine with a single SSD.

I'll preface by saying I agree the Ethereum guys have reinvented lots of wheels.


In this case, the defenders are miners. So long as there's a single _rational_ miner, then there'll be someone watching. There's naturally huge incentives for miners to do this: the same ones that are given by Nakamoto consensus. They can make other miners lose a whole truckload of money if they detect fraud, and can lose a whole truckload of money if they commit fraud.


Under permissioned models, yes. The authors cleverly allow short sidechain reorgs so that withheld sidechain blocks can simply be orphaned. Given that this sidechain, unlike [merge mined] sidechains deployed on Bitcoin, doesn't need its own token, it's perfectly reasonable to expect a large fraction of miners (as in, close to 100%) to engage in merged block production. Actually attacking the sidechain as you described would then need a majority of hashrate. Doable sure, in the same way reorging Bitcoin is doable.


This is trivial to do on Ethereum. Finally something Ethereum is good for!
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:53:52
My (admittedly novice) understanding of the paper is that the authors propose a "merged block production" scheme whereby miners can produce blocks for both a main chain (say, Ethereum) and a sidechain at the same time by simply bonding some coins for each sidechain block they merge-produce. Unlike [merged mining]( every sidechain block needs to be committed to in a main chain block. This gives it the permissionless property without diluting security.
The trustless two-way peg is achieved by using a [Plasma exit game]( (made actually possible due to the permissionless consensus mechanism used, unlike previous iterations of Plasma which suffered from intractable mass exits) and [fraud and data availability proofs](
The combination of these two properties for a sidechain has never been seen before, at least in my limited knowledge.

Besides being off-topic to the OP, and not being wrong, what's the point you're trying to convey?
From the very source you linked:


An Ethereum archival node should more accurately be called an _indexed_ node. I just indexes historical data to make it faster to lookup, it doesn't contain any more or any less history than a non-archival full node.
Now, I'm not saying that archival node size isn't a problem. It very much is, as the storage provided by Ethereum's statefulness means you basically need to use an archival node to interact with dapps (which is why so many people connect to the small number of remote archive nodes). But to be clear an archival node doesn't store any additional history and their presence is strictly unnecessary for the survival or security of the Ethereum network.

"Longest chain" is the case assuming constant difficulty, so it's used colloquially. Precisely, the canonical chain is the _heaviest_ valid one: the one with the most accumulated work that meets all the consensus rules.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:05:42
Rootstock exists, but uses a federated peg. To the best of my knowledge, no one has devised a trustless two-way peg scheme for Bitcoin, making sidechains basically useless. Liquid also uses a federated peg. Drivechain is a miner-federated peg, so it's not solving anything.
On the other hand, an Ethereum researcher has claimed to have devised a mechanism that has both a weakly trustless (trustless under such weak assumptions it _is_ trustless for all practical intents and purposes) two-way peg _and_ is permissionless. It's the first system of its kind and, if the claims are true, solves the scalability problem. Link:

Liquid uses a federated peg. The federation can steal your coins at will. Essentially, they have custody of your coins. Expect sidechains with a federated peg to be considered money transmitters sooner rather than later.
