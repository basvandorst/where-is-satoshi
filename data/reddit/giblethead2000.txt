One thing I've never really got my head around... Given that the miners effectively control what blocks get onto the blockchain, what prevents them all colluding to continue mining 25btc blocks after the block reward halving is supposed to happen?

Nice survey. Would have been better with an 'other' option for online merchants. I'm not in the US so it's not practical to use most of those.
Also, I agree with the other comments here on the level of technical knowledge.
I would have liked to see a 'cold storage' option for the wallets, as it's the most secure way to store your coins.
I'd have liked to see a question about the silk road and other darknet sites. It's the perception of some in the wider community that BTC == Blow Stamps, and I'd like to know how pervasive that is. (Although most of us here would disagree with that notion, so the results may be somewhat skewed)

If you're interested in finding more out about borrowers, I created a community site at  that takes the publicly-available information from btcjam and presents it in an easy-to-digest format.
Makes life a lot easier for investors looking for good loans.
There's also a very active Facebook community called the "Bitcoin Investment Assocation" that helps people identify good loans to invest in (and draws attention to potential scams)

Well, not everyone has the time or the inclination to read a 30 page document. :-) It seems like proof-of-storage is central to your system and it would be nice to have a short layman's explanation of how you are managing the 'proof' part in a decentralized way.
I plan to read your document, of course.

Why does Bitcoin favour older inputs over more recent ones? It can potentially cost more to spend a newer input than an older one, and a transaction that spends an older input has more chance of making it into a block.
What benefit does this mechanism provide?

Yeah, there's also the issue of responding truthfully when logged in to your google account. ;-)

I've done this too, and they said something similar. I can't believe at we are the only ones. Their main thing is to flog nerdy tat, rather than anything truly geeky. I suspect it's not high on their list of priorities.

I've seen people selling USB block erupters on there for £900, and people have bought them. *sigh*

Prices have got more competitive recently. I made some money trading BTC on bitbargain, buying from bitstamp and reselling. Selling on bitbargain can be hard work though, as you either have to allow newbs who make a lot of mistakes, or set your settings high enough that you don't get many offers. -- You do need a reasonable markup on there or it's not worth your time.
It's been getting harder to get a competetive price, lots of undercutters... So, I've given up on that.
Besides, both bitbargain and bittylicious charge more than speedybitcoin most of the time, so it's easier just to use that. It's a much simpler system, too.

Can you give more information on this? What are the details that would never get accepted into bitcoin core? What metadata is stored, and and what do the verification-like transactions actually verify?
Also, the metadisk pdf references proof-of-storage. Do you have more details on this? The paper is pretty light. If proof-of-storage is actually the proof algorithm, what to prevents a number of malicious nodes getting together and fabricating their proof-of-storage hashes, to convince the rest of the network that they have data that they actually don't.  -- It strikes me that blocks would be pretty hard to verify by nodes that don't have the data in question, which most won't.
Is proof-of-storage the (only?) algorithm used to mine blocks?

You haven't really answered my questions... It would be neat if you could address them here so that it doesn't look like you're being evasive. :-)

Our internet gets severely congested/qos'd (not sure which) at around 6-10pm most days, meaning we struggle to watch iplayer/lovefilm on our smart TV in HD, and have to switch to standard def. We have fttc via BT infinity.
Would switching mitigate this problem?

This is on testnet so you can't actually get paid for your services yet. The coins are quite literally worthless. You need to wait for the mainnet version before you can charge.

I haven't tried it yet, but Twitter? That doesn't sound very decentralised. What is it used for, and can the app function without it?

I was thinking this would be great for countries with restrictive firewalls, but I guess a 2-way satellite dish would be equally prohibited in such an environment.
Maybe a receive-only device could be used for retrieval of new blocks, but that doesn't help send new transactions.

I suspect age verification may also have something to do with it? Probably implementing a payment mechanism that a 12 year old could use might at least generate some concerns even if it doesn't get then in legal hot water.

He bought a 3D software company called Shade 3D.
[Here's an announcement]( that mentions the sale, and [here's a news article]( that mentions it.
Neither of those discuss what he was thinking at the time... ಠ_ಠ

I keep recommending BTC-E. They've been around for ages, so would probably have done a runner with the coins by now if they were going to, and IIRC last time I got fiat into there it was slow, the markup wasn't great, but the kyc checks weren't a massive issue. That was a long time ago so ymmv. 
No bank that wants to stay in business is going to touch a company that trades BTC and doesn't do strict anti-fraud checks with a bargepole. They'll end up on the hook for money laundering.

There is strong evidence that mtgox (the largest exchange at the time) was pumping the price up with fake trading activity.

Hopefully, given that it's easy for them to prove solvency WRT their bitcoin holdings, they will do that.

Thanks. I had heard that he'd signed some text from a known Satoshi address so assumed true. Some googling has pointed me to [this page]( which explains otherwise, so it sounds fishy to me.
I don't know what the relationship is between this and the fact that "There was no download of a signature file of electrum (.asc file) from a UK IP on Apr 7th" though. - Does this point to dishonest behaviour of some kind on the part of Gavin or Wright? If so, why?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:40:21
Not really. The obstinance is pushing people towards more technologically-advanced coins like ETH or XMR, and away from BTC, whose only real advantage is market adoption due to being first. It may hurt a little now but it's better for the community in the long run.
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:06:58
It's not even that really... The biggest change only affects miners. Most of whom are mining via pools anyway. So whether or not to relay transactions of a certain kind is really something that pool operators get to decide.
In theory, the process can be democratised by pool operators stating "we relay microtransactions" vs. "we don't..." - If more miners point themselves at the microtransaction-capable pool, microtransactions win and the default settings lose.
I can't see that the managers of the large mining pools simply applying the defaults in the client without thinking about them first.

Really? From where I'm standing in the UK, a lot of people I know took out mortgages (with *decent* deposits, not that 100% crap) who now cannot afford to sell their house as it's worth less than they owe on it. 
There is no guarantee of a financial return on a house.

Quite a lot less than three bitcoin! ;-)

How are these things "tangible"? I can see the benefit for (in decreasing order of things I understand) drug dealers, money launderers and currency speculators... But for normal people they seem quite imaginary. Nobody gets paid in them, you can't use them for things you actually need such as food, so what purpose do they serve apart from an esoteric extension to the banking system?
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:35:13
Can confirm... I've been getting asked questions on Facebook by people who vaguely know I'm interested in Bitcoin and have heard about it over the last few days. These people are fairly non-techincal, and it's the first time I've had other people mentioning it to me.
