So you're saying he changed his opinion rather than sticking to dogma? *gasp*. next you'll be call him a john Kerry style flip-flopper hypocrite. I am more pissed off by people who don't change their opinion in response to new (relevant) information

Yeah, I don't think I've heard or read a great or inspiring oratory speech that began with the words "you dumb fuckers"

@_date: 2015-02-21 16:59:12
you don't know the meaning of the word dedication. perhaps it was all that abuse you suffered at the hands of the state?
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:52:44
the context is that you've been abused 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:53:27

@_date: 2015-02-23 16:33:43

@_date: 2015-02-21 17:00:15
your autism spectrum must be off the radar. its sort of nice in a way to remove emotional maturity or sensibility in dealing with individuals. its taught me a lot about life. i could suckle knowledge from your teets quite easily
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:32:04
dank kush is the answer brah, fuck laws we can have sex on a pile of fiat gubmint moneez
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:58:25
thanks, know of any other resources?
i am asking here because i dont really read anything other than zero hedge occasionally 
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:06:01
as a UK person, is there a less dodge alternative to localbitcoins? i'm thinking of buying £300 worth by the beginning of jan, but i dont want to mess around with cons or anything. 
also i havent the faintest clue what a paper wallet is or how to make sure i've recieved the coins after the transaction is ended
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:09:39
dank kush is the new governing philosophy. don't tread on me!
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:39
cheers but i wish it was one for the UK
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:35:52
i'm going to save this comment because i am also uk based and wondering about the tax issues involved with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:20:24
Been closely following for about 4 months now, and  am astonished at the value it is now.
Couple of newb questions, but can someone help me out?
Uk redditor, how do i buy bitcoins, whats the minimum i can buy, and how do i make sure my bank doesn't cancel the transaction? [as i've read from anecdotal evidence on this sub, they've been known to do in britain in the past] 
I've got what maybe a £100 i can speculate with, should i buy now, or wait for the dip? will there be a dip? also i could only buy fractions of a BTC, still worth it? how much are transaction fees with the Uk exchanges?
thanks for anyone that can answer these questions [preferably brits as they would be familiar with our financial systems, tax etc]
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:33:09
anyone, that EVER comes into a bit of money, i link them this [blog post]( 
the guy who wrote it has made and lost more money than people care to dream. he's now managing a hedge fund, but almost entirely self taught 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:53:19
how do you go about declaring bitcoin though?
and if you dont mind answering, how many BTC did you sell?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:40:45
sales tax is basically VAT. and we have it on petrol as well. basically anything
