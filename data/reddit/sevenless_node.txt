Can't tell whether or not this is a troll, or a sincere effort.  Either way, I'm downright curious about the mental state of OP.  Couldn't be worse if you tried!

"Should be" but alas, convenience is a hell of a drug, and I doubt that little quirk of human psychology is going to change any time soon. Fact is, centralized platforms \*do\* offer something useful, and that's for the layman to not need to think.

Don't do this.  I locked myself out of a significant block of coins this way.  
You'll have to cook up software to make this work.  It's trivially easy to screw this up.  One wrong digit and you have locked your funds out for not just 10 years, but 100.  
I suggest instead to use something supported by today's software, such as m-of-n key splitting, and use an IRL solution to ensure you can't reunite those keys till the specified date passes. Plus, you can also setup backup plans this way in case your various shards gets destroyed.
10 years is a long time. Bitcoin has only been around about as long.  Things change.

Sir I hijacked a collage computer lab for 8 hours to mine, only to decide it was dumb as hell and trash the whole project.  Even had live boot CDs to make new nodes.
It haunts me.
