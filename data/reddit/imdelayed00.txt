Again,  bitcoin isnt a company,  doesnt have any assets,  doesn't have earnings or dividends.  What expectation of profit can their be for such a thing? The profitability of trading bitcoin is entirely a factor of the tactics of the trader as stated before bitcoin is a protocol and doesn't change day to day. There are plenty of people profiting hugely from it.
