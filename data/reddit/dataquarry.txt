Is bitcoin divisible enough to take on all wealth of all countries? And when countries with artificially weaker fiat join in, won't people who bought in with strong fiat lose out some value?

I think it’ll behave like an asset until the infrastructure (2nd layer and merchants) make it convenient to use as a currency.

I would be surprised if traditional banks used comparable or more. I’d just like a figure. Banks also include energy consumption for travel/accommodation of employees and customers as well as for built public infrastructure.

When an wallet app calculates my taxes and sends me a simplified pdf optimized to enter into TurboTax at the end of the year I will use as currency.

Sci Am says gaming consoles in all of US use about the same kwh as San Diego.  With a huge fudge factor using population of SD vs USA as a correlate for domestic energy use, that’s ~0.4% of energy consumption. 
I don’t know what these numbers really mean.

Yes, adoption would likely increase value of the crypto you are holding.

Would like to see a comparison of electricity use for btc if it was used globally vs all electricity consumed by the banking and associated sectors bitcoin would replace. Also, if there was ever a time for places to ramp up clean energy capture now would be the time.

So I guess you’re appalled by trump silencing political opponents.
BTW companies aren’t required to support free speech. The US government is. Otherwise we could force Fox News to carry factual coverage.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:27:47
0.5% of what? Of what it eventually will? And by then how much will be covered by clean energy? I wouldn’t be surprised if bitcoin had replaced 0.01% of banking by now. Not sure how this comment is quantitative. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:56:36
Some are. How much slimmer are banks without checking/savings? At least in US most are too poor to invest.

I really think someone will come up a wallet that records this for you and gives you an easy form at the end of the year to use for taxes.

Well even if you work hard and budget, at least in America, there’s little chance you’ll get retirement. At least btc is soothing people with false hope.

The question is whether you think btc will rise at a faster pace than interest.
I'd sell, pay the credit card, apply for a introductory zero interest card, fill it up to whatever and buy a btc off money not spent, assuming u can pay the 0 interest off quickly

Are there any altcoins mine-able on a cheap laptop that you can trade for btc?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:31:59
What market can you fairly compare bitcoin to? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:41:15
Interesting insights but odd to make such strong conclusions when they admit the modeling is based on things unlike bitcoin. They also don't believe btc has inherent value, and that it will remain a dual asset/currency. I think once people start using it as currency the value will stabilize tremendously. Especially since it's kind of a global average of what people are willing to spend.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:32:02
It's well documented. You're either ignorant or trolling- which, if you're a us citizen, both of these contributed to massive healthcare loss, the breaking up of families, invigorated nazism and police brutality, so fuck right off.

There is a demonstrated rise in nazism and white supremacist terrorism. Attacks the president sides with and encourages publicly. You can overpay and die from overpriced healthcare for all I care. Socialism is not at odds with the US, read a book for once. I WISH I could fuck right off with socialized medicine like every other wealthy nation on the planet. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:19
I bought what I can afford and since many countries and companies seem interested in making btc into a functional worldwide currency, I'll hodl. Maybe if this adoption happens, it'll turn out i will lose 99% of the value I put in, in which case I'll buy an incredibly expensive sandwich and have a good laugh knowing that by hodling and supporting btc in conversation I helped realize it's potential.
I know there are others that take a similar attitude which is why I don't think you can compare the market for btc to anything like a stock.

Donald trump won’t understand this, or care about helping small business, give me a break. But he will take Russia’s lead, and they are adopting crypto aggressively (to the detriment of USD).

Yes. The record of money and it’s value will be decentralized, but IMO we won’t get adoption until there is are centralized services that make using btc as easy as PayPal. I’ll start spending btc as a currency as soon as there’s an app/wallet that tracks value when I buy, chooses which btc to sell when I purchase something to maximize any gains on my end, and sends me a tax form of all these capital gains at the end of the year.
