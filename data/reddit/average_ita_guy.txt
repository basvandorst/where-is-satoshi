maybe it's for all the kool-aid stick in the gullet of the kool-aid drinkers? (the ones who managed to understand it)

Coinbase? Bitinstant? Why there's not an ebay alternative that just uses bitcoin as ebay does with paypal? I think THAT would actually benefit all bitcoin community very much. So why there's not?

Localbitcoins.com is fine - if you find the buyers as you said. I was speaking about the trustability of an italian based exchange.

I hope it's "faux" but anyway it's police, nothing is impossible with them. You should have tell you own 1312 BTC lol

Thank you for the short, simple and good explanation.That's what I was meaning. I'm also sure that if someone brought us to that market cup abruptly, with a single order on a single exchange, a lot of people would actually start to sell (putting new sell orders) soon after that (and yes, I know you were talking in theory, didn't you?) taking down the price a bit. So the "real" cost of gettin there is not actually quantificable: it depends on people willingness to hold, and that's not exactly measurable. But we are talkin in theory. [Theory is necessary for good practice, to me. But not sufficient. And maybe it's because of that that I got downvotes. Who knows, who cares.]

Uhm.. maybe it's because they rely solely on blockchain.info for verifications (and blockchain.info was down for maintenance)? Just sayin. Hope it solves fine, I'm about to drop some money in kraken in a couple of days and I'll watch it closely.

In theory, that's not quite exact. Now we have a market cap of billions without billions actually being put in the market. But in practice, I guess we need "a lot of money" to go up from here (though maybe not really tens of billions).

It's true and it's a desperate move.

I'd trust more a bank account in singapore than an italian exchange - no offence intended (for singapore).
