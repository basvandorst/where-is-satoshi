You're not a schmuck. You didn't know the future, dude. Besides, the real mistake wasn't buying the pizza; it was *not* buying more bitcoins when you weren't a broke college student.

The rise before the fall.
In other words, institutionals are buying up market share before futures trading starts Sunday.
December is going to be an insane month for bitcoin.
Also, pretty sneaky of CBOE to undercut CME by a week. The rivalry never ends.

Pablo Escobar was one of the richest people in the world. Multi, multi billionaire.
He imported so many hippopotamuses onto his property, that they reached a stable breeding population and are now an invasive species in the area.

How about the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention? They help suicide survivors too. Most people have unbelievably cruel opinions of suicide, so the issue gets contemptuously ignored. Even survivors (i.e. the loved ones of someone who committed suicide) get neglected.

Arbitrage between these markets just means the futures price is going to stay very close to bitcoin's actual price.

None of this has to do with "should."

At this point it's obvious that crypto would surge in acceptance if the US economy crashed. Wtf are you even talking about? You know, "the u.s. economy" crashing does not mean the world is post-apocalyptic.

Like I said, you just don't care. You want him to suffer, whatever that entails.
Certainly he needs to be stopped and treated pretty damn harshly. However, it's very hard to believe he would do anything like this again as a 70 year old man after 40 years in prison. This overzealous, expensive punishment is not protection; it's anger.
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:41:51
Hey this isn't a crazy point. The guy's sentence is way too extreme.
However, this argument is going to divide people on cultural lines. The US justice system continually ignores all proof that extreme sentences don't help mitigate crime, because people in that culture don't care; it's about revenge. They *want* to see criminals in pain, not being rehabilitated.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:08:33

You have no idea if that is true.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:25:32
You know, it all depends on what you mean by "speculation." You're right for the most part, but a lot of people will think non-speculative means riskless, which is wrong. And they might categorically oppose something more risky because of that false belief.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:40:11
I think he wants to be Satoshi AND THEN SOME. Being close isn't enough. That's his whole deal. He wants to be a guy that is holding 50+% of all the wealth in the world when society transforms. That's what is going through his head and why he is trying to convert the world to his new currency that is above all else designed to get him a shitload of coins from the beginning.

What is it that you want to invest in? I guarantee you can do it yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:31:02
The whole debt thing is just a psychological obstacle. The point is that you transferred your wealth from bitcoin to real estate.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:20:06
It exists for other investments too, even bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:46:28
Relax. It's not shit. But I am being a little pedantic
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:43:28
But the profit you have realized in this hypothetical is measured in a crypto.

We'll see how humorously futile it is when people start being imprisoned or killed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:35:11
Then they'll make their own exchange.
Also, there very much is a chance that a pension would hold a very small portion of something like BTC or a BTC exchange within a small subset of alternative investments.

It's impossible for them to stop the eventual rise of cryptocurrency given enough time (and barring the end of the human species). But they can cause incredible short term harm in all kinds of ways. This is the defining struggle of our lifetimes.

no shit you stupid bot
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:13:27
Yes, that's a problem. What you are describing would inevitably become entirely necessary to use bitcoin as it scales up. The long term solution should never be a decentralized one; it should be a distributed one. You describe a system in which a relatively small number of actors could virtually stop transactions at will. If there are hubs like this, there should be hundreds of thousands or millions of them. Or better none at all.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:16:13
There's no way I'd tell some jackass financial advisor about bitcoin. Those people are sharks, not your friends, and they are generally very stupid. Financial advisors are the absolute lowest rung of the world of finance. They don't even have to have college degrees. They all give the same advice and make money by squeezing their clients. Please don't go to Schwab. If you really want a financial advisor, find one that charges you by the hour instead of taking commissions and management fees.
Also, they are going to try to take as much of your money as they can possibly convince you to give them to put in their own funds. I swear to God what you are doing is like jumping into a swimming pool full of sharks with blood all over you.
Edit: Seriously, guys. It's a dirty, dirty business. Advisors are salesmen. I don't care if you think your financial advisor is really nice and honest with you. It's their job to make you feel that way while they offer you virtually nothing of value you couldn't attain yourself but happily take a percentage of your money every month.

The actual memo:
He makes plenty of good, general investing points, but it's all vague. He admits to not understanding bitcoin, but doesn't say it's nuts. He just repeats that it "looks like a bubble." His main argument is that the incredible level of excitement surrounding bitcoin is the way everyone feels at the top of a bubble.
The chart is nonsense. You can't just take completely unrelated assets and point to some vague similarity in the shape of a chart. I could just as easily compare Bitcoin to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google stocks (or any number of a million other obvious or esoteric examples). And by indexing, the chart completely ignores the total market cap of its examples, so Bitcoin's current 133B is being compared to bubbles that represented entire or majority portions of national economies. AND the charts don't even look alike.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:15:45
That's not at all necessarily true. And in the long run it's flat out wrong.

No. He is one of the richest people in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:09:42
What exchange rate are you supposed to use? What if you *didn't* pay fiat for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:34:50
Yeah yeah "studying trends" is a hell of a lot more specific than the vague "things go up and down" analogies in the first half. Be specific or gtfo.
What trends are you talking about?
What amount *in numbers* do you mean by "dip?"
What time period do you mean by "near future?"
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:23:19
Yes, it is. Wall Street will find a way to try to make money off it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:04:39
JP Morgan makes money off you trading with their platform no matter what the truth is about bitcoin.

You have good intentions but you are fighting an unwinnable uphill battle. Just my advice to you personally.

You know, the way this works is that if enough people "reach their moon," bitcoin stops traveling to moons.
