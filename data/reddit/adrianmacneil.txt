Completely agree. I've spoken with and given that you (and a few other unlucky people affected by this application) took all the right security precautions, and that we should not have allowed this application to use the Coinbase name and logo, we're going to refund the full amount taken from your account.
We're also reviewing our existing list of applications which request permission to debit from people's accounts, and discussing some longer term changes which would allow apps to build on top of our platform, without risking the finances of our customers.

I completely agree, and we're refunding all users affected by this application.

We're aware of similar reports of oauth phishing applications (I'm not sure whether it was your report specifically), and have been discussing a longer-term solution for this internally. It's unfortunate that we were not able to put in place a permanent solution before this most recent attack. However, we're making this a top priority, and we will make some changes to review our oauth applications this week.
In general, for security issues, the best place to report them is  (and as a bonus, we will pay a bounty for these reports if they are disclosed correctly).

Thanks for bringing this up. This is definitely wasn't a business decision, or Coinbase trying to create artificial barriers to bitcoin - it's simply a feature on our site which was created a long time ago, which was never updated, and has not received much attention lately.
We're going to fix this page so that it allows you to send directly to a bitcoin address - just as we do with other features such as payment pages, tip buttons, and our merchant tools/checkout.

To clarify, it has always been possible to retrieve the public "Display Name" of a Coinbase account given that you already know the email address. You can simply send bitcoin to that user, and we will show their Display Name in your list of transactions. The "Display Name" is intended to be akin to a Facebook or Twitter name, and is public information.
We wrote about this practice on our blog back in April:
This issue is not significantly different - given that you have a large list of email addresses, you can test whether these addresses have a Coinbase account. This is possible on every single website today:
This attack only makes it slightly easier to discover public user data, by allowing you to look up users without needing to send any bitcoin to them first. In any case, we already have a fix for this issue (leaking gravatar MD5 hash) under development and will be rolling it out shortly.
Edit: The trolls are downvoting me. Sorry you had to scroll to find this response.

Good point. As far as I'm aware we haven't had any requests for this yet, but to gauge interest I've enabled it on translate.coinbase.com :)

We're only using CF for DoS protection right now. Would like to add caching in future, but we need to make sure caches are correctly busted when new blocks/transactions come in.
In the meantime, if you want to ensure you are getting a fresh copy of the data you could append &amp;nonce=&lt;randomstring&gt; to the URL.

It's been said before, but this has nothing to do with bitcoin price fluctuation, and if you get accidentally caught by our fraud algorithm, you can contact Coinbase support and we will happily honor the original price.

We're working on improving our pagination, but in the meantime:
@_date: 2014-10-08 07:22:47
Coinbaser here.
I'm really sorry you had this bad experience. Obviously our fraud detection system is not perfect, but we are actively working to improve this. The reason that sometimes it is incorrectly triggered for accounts like yours which may already have previous buy/sell history is that it is constantly learning from new activity on the system.
However, we understand this is not perfect, so if you contact support we can make this right. Specifically, if you complete the requirements for level 2 verification then it is far less likely you will get caught up in the fraud system.
I assure you this has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin. Obviously people are much more upset when the prices goes up, but this is not a factor in our fraud system (in fact it would not help us anyway, because we always buy BTC at the same time as you place the order, so the price fluctuation makes no difference to us).
Edit: Just sent you a PM with contact details to get this resolved.

Pretty much spot on here. Our old charts page displayed the average price for the day in US Pacific time, whereas our new charts page displays the daily average in UTC.

We take phishing attacks very seriously, and have had only one major successful phishing attack in the past 6 months. We are constantly improving this - Charlie made a good list of all the improvements we have made this year here:
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:47:40
I would rephrase this slightly: If you care about _anonymity_, don't use Coinbase. We absolutely do AML/KYC - this is how we are able to provide a seamless buy/sell experience by linking your US or European bank account.
However, we take privacy very seriously. Any breach of private user data would be responded to in the swiftest manner, and publicly disclosed by us (it has never happened though).
In this particular instance, only existing known public data is shown to users. We are still tightening up how we handle this situation though - see my response below, which unfortunately has been downvoted out of sight.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:53:07
I'm sorry to hear that. We're constantly working to improve our support (I'll be the first to admin that at the start of 2014, it was less than spectacular, but we have made big improvements since then).
Most of us do read reddit pretty frequently, but in general you should get a much faster response by simply emailing.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:26:18
We haven't rollout out any changes yet - does your username page work in a regular browser?
@_date: 2014-11-26 17:30:05
We also lowered the bar to get a referral bonus - previously you only received the $5 when a referred user placed a buy order for over $100 worth of bitcoin. Now, you get $1 for every user who creates an account and simply completes the signup process. Overall, we think this will lead to more referrals being paid out.
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:09:36
Great question. 
At Coinbase, because we offer both buying and selling of BTC, we are able to match many orders internally. However, when there is more price pressure in one particular direction (e.g. when more people want to sell BTC than buy), we trade on the open market to fulfil these orders. This allows us to always offer market rates for both buying and selling BTC, without being exposed directly to the volatility risk.

Not sure why the Toshi hate (or why running a cache would be bad). The limit parameter is documented here:
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:46:11
I think it's a good point, it would be nice to round to 4 or even 6dp. Displaying that many decimals in most situations is unnecessary.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:00:41
Yes, your "available" account balance now no longer includes unconfirmed coins. Previously, we allowed you to immediately send unconfirmed coins to an external address, but the actual transaction would not be broadcast until the bitcoin in your account was confirmed (6 confirmations). This lead to a bad user experience where people expected a transaction to happen immediately (e.g. paying an online invoice), and by the time we actually sent the confirmed coins the invoice had expired. With the new system, we make it clear that unconfirmed bitcoin in your account is not immediately available to send/sell.
Thanks for the feedback on our accounting tools - we are actively working to improve these so will take it on board!
@_date: 2014-10-21 05:19:54
I agree, it's terrible when this happens and we're doing everything we can to improve our email service. Unfortunately email isn't 100% reliable - some companies (especially AOL and vt.edu) send our email to spam folders or even outright block it. We're working with these email providers to fix it, but in the meantime I would put pressure on your email provider to look into why they are blocking our email.
Unfortunately contacting Coinbase support in these cases also won't help, since reply emails from our support system are also blocked.
If you are still having issues and think it's your email provider, I would suggest contacting our support from an alternate email address and let them know you can't receive email at the old address (we can look into why the email is failing for your particular address, and after verification we can transfer your account to an alternate email).
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:00:32
Coinbase does send money from an address unique to your account. This means that if someone were to refund a bitcoin transaction made from Coinbase, it would end up in the correct wallet.

We're working on opening up 8333 behind our firewall (and doing some final tests before we open it on our production environment). However, you can easily run Toshi with 8333 open on your own server (environment variable).
Re the bootstrap torrent, yes it is possible to import. However, we're planning on providing our own pg_dump torrent which will be considerably faster for bootstrapping Toshi.

To clarify: We are not leaking emails anywhere, and never have been. To be clear, you can't do this unless you already know the email. Given that you already have an email address, you can see the _public username_ and display name for that person by sending bitcoin to them (it will show up in your transaction list).
This is no different to nearly every other web service out there. There is no obligation for Coinbase users to have a username or even use their real name as the public display name on their account.
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:03:01
Coinbase has this built in. You can generate a "Cost Basis for Taxes" report under Tools &gt; Reports in your account.

Yes, we pay translators to manage our primary supported languages. For other languages, we're offering the community the chance to participate (rather than have no translation at all). However, we're hoping to officially support more languages in the near future.

Yeah, it wasn't anything that exciting. Lots of people access reddit from our single office IP, and we apparently tripped some spam detection because a bunch of us got shadowbanned. I've considered making a new account, but I really like my username (and previously went to the effort of verifying it on keybase etc). got the same treatment.
Anyway, I think I've been whitelisted in this sub, because my posts seem to appear to the public pretty much instantly.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:02:05
I can probably shed a bit more light on this for you.
When you make a transaction from Coinbase, we want the "sending address" to be linked to your account (so that if someone were to return bitcoin back to that address, you would receive it in your account, rather than it going to our hot wallet or a random Coinbase user).
So when you send money, we make two transactions: one from our hot wallet to a new address in your wallet, then a second from that new address to wherever you are sending your bitcoin. This is why the transaction you see on the blockchain is always spending unconfirmed outputs. There is nothing inherently wrong with this - we broadcast the transactions sequentially, and Bitcoin Core will accept the second transaction into its memory pool as long as it has already seen the first transaction. The alternative would be to send money from our hot wallet directly (which we have discussed internally), but the downside of this is that if someone were to return the bitcoin, we would have no way of knowing which user it belongs to.

Director of Engineering at Coinbase here.
I fully sympathize with your loss, and please know that we will do everything in our power to make this right, and prevent it from happening again.
I would like to point out that right now, we don't "authorize" apps. Anyone is free to use our API and create applications (we do this because we believe in having an open, powerful API, rather than having a walled garden a la Apple). We do prevent applications from using "Coinbase" in their name, however in this case, the attacker used a clever combination of unicode characters to work around our naming restrictions.
I'd also like to put in a word for our awesome support team, who work hard to ensure everyone on Coinbase has a great experience. We don't discuss account details via the live chat, and instead encourage people to send an email to support. In this case, once the transfer had been broadcast to the network, there is nothing we can do to cancel it. By the time you had seen the transfer listed in your Coinbase account, it was already too late.
I 100% agree that this is not good enough though. We take phishing seriously, and it should not be this easy to bypass our device verification and two factor authentication security mechanisms, and we may need to rethink open access to certain parts of our API (such as the ability to withdraw money from your account). We will make this a priority, so expect to see some changes to our API policies this week, as a direct response to this attack.
Edit: We're refunding all users affected by this application.
Edit 2: Downvoted, really?

Hey guys, Adrian from Coinbase here. Thought we could share a brief TL;DR for those who are interested in the technical aspects.
For the standard individual multisig vault, there are 3 keys, with 2 required to sign transactions.
* One is generated and stored by Coinbase.
* One is generated in your browser, encrypted with your password, and then sent to Coinbase
* One is generated in your browser, and is never seen by Coinbase.
Regular withdrawals involve signing transactions in the browser, by decrypting the shared key with your password.
For recovery, you print out the encrypted key and the user key. These plus the password will allow sending bitcoin without Coinbase.
In addition, if you forget your password, you can also recover your bitcoin using your user key.
If this isn't clear, this image should help:
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:27:01
I'm oversimplifying things, but effectively Bitcoin Core stores most information (transactions, blocks) in raw binary format. This is super efficient, but means you cannot (for example) query all transactions over a certain amount, or all transactions for a particular address, as you would with a regular database. Toshi stores all this in a SQL database, which is less space efficient, but also much easier to query.
That said, we're treating this as a beta, and we're actively working on improving our storage efficiency.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:49:28
We think this could scale to at least 10x current size (2tb+ postgres database), but we're also working on improving our current storage efficiency, and in future sharding the database.
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:36:36
Yes. We've looked into Neo4J for generating interesting secondary stats (e.g. taint analysis), but I don't think it would be a good fit for syncing the blockchain (validating blocks/transactions, handling reorgs etc).
That said, we may look into other nosql databases for general blockchain storage in future.

Thanks, we're looking into this! It appears tip counter cache is not updating when transactions are sent to a bitcoin address. Rest assured that the recipient has your BTC, the only issue here is updating the counter on the button.
Hoping to have a fix for this by the end of the day.
