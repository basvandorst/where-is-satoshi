where would i do that?
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:26:46
I just bought the keepkey hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:26:42
Dude you have weak hands, you should consider selling your bitcoin and just buying lotto tickets.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:30:15
I honestly believe we are going to live to see the times of the usd collapse, im just preparing ahead of time by buying bitcoin, gold, silver.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:35:09
i assume so, im just gonna have to see when it arrives here.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:46:21
already on it chief. i got myself a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:03:14
Thats why i told her to do research before buying lol
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:49:38
why do you say that?
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:14:03
I see your point now. Market price affects mining cost. Dunnin Krugher effect was strong with me ��
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:33:28
No one produces something with the intention of selling it at a loss.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:32:20
I know it wont. Fucking bank of america and a bunch of other corrupt banking institutions are hopping on the bandwagon.
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:02:14
smart move, or you could print out notes with qr codes on em with 1 satoshi each.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:29:53
you never know. Bitcoin probably is just gonna be used as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-29 20:28:08
I love that quote by satoshi. Absolutely brilliant and true. Once more people understand the fundamentals there is no looking back.
@_date: 2019-12-29 19:57:32
I meant less bitcoin being created.
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:04:15
you wish lol
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:05:38
i wouldnt want the fed to get thier hands on that idea. they would fuck it up just like they did with the gold standard
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:12:14
If Donald Trump gets kicked out of office, how many oreos will people consume in a year? There's no saying or knowing....
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:32:43
The cost to buy would be 1 quadrillion because selling at 999 trillion would net a loss for the miner
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:31:19
Thank you! And you are the most intelligent!
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:20:09
thsts why i said imagine. wed be rich
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:39:52
not ready to be used by billions of people yet. That will come with time.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:25:59
not yet that is
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:34:43
The system is purposely built on debt so that they can cause chaos; and then proceed to offer a solution for a one world currency.
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:56:13
no but ill give it a read. is there a pdf online?
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:27:13
Theres nothing that can stop the banksters from creating a new currency and completely erasing the debt.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:29:40
What question is that?
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:26:43
couldnt agree with you more but I feel like people will not see the true value in it and dish out on shitty coins in the coming years.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:55:18
We basically are already a cashless society. The main goal for the banksters now is to create a centralizef system that has everyones accounts for even more control.
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:26:04
Lets hope you are right
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:28:31
i mean how do you know it will
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:23:55
I probably should have rephrased that. Currently around 2% of the world is using crypto currencies, do you see 50%-80% of the world using it in the distant future?
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:29:19
I understand the importance of it, I have well over 50% of my money in bitcoin. Im just worried about the sheeple who dont understand the importance of it.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:28:12
Why do you believe it will succeed?
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:49:34
Thats a great way of explaining it. Happy that we both got on the right train.
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:45:15
im not trolling lol. Just a bit concerned about how things will play out
