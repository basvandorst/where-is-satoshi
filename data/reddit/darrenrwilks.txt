WE are doing our best. But the Governor just declared the area a emergency disaster zone so it is safe to assume the gov will come in and start running this madness.

I tried signing up and got an error because my password was too long.  I changed my password to 16 characters, and I get the error that "It looks like I'm trying to spam the network"  I only hit submit twice :/

Bitcoin with multisig in the Treasury is an insurance policy IMO.  I love our country, and dont wanna see the Fed print our value away.

3 of my past girl friends have bitcoin wallets and my current one has over $200 dollars in her wallet.  She wants to know where to spend it!

She's gonna do exactly what I told her to do... sell it on Circle.com.  If she had shopping options..   What do you think she'd do with it?  She'd shop!!!  And this is NOT a throw away account... its me!
