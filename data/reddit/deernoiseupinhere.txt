Do some research.

Gold isn't special. Also, silver is straight up better for many things.

You think you can just send a giant box of cash out of the USA with no questions? The government can seize your money for literally no reason. No probable cause of a crime even needed.
Don't pretend like Americans live under some free system. The government fucking owns you.

Oh ok, that's so much different than every single other spike.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:04
Yep, too late for you.
Just like at 1k, 5k, and 7k.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:28:12
Ah sorry dude, you're too late. Of the 748384745 gazillion price hikes THIS is the point where you're too late.

Yep... I think mine was around 0.8 BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:32:16
Yes "they" were. You could get a ton of stuff. I bought a watch too. Pretty legit fake Rolex.

When it's based on stealing freedom from its citizens, absolutely. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:25:46
What makes BTC special? Are doctors and lawyers getting robbed constantly because they have USD?

Except when it is.

Sure, whatever

Meh. There are 2000+ billionaires. You can find the address of many of them online. Most probably aren't good robbery/kidnapping targets.
I get why he was freaked out, but there are far better targets for some random ass criminal reading the news.

Same. They're really cool. I have some nazi coins with Paul von Hindenburg on them too.

It's back up to 5600 and climbing... 
What are your predictions based on?
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:49:14
Exactly. Same with the Saddam dinars. They still use dinars, but the Saddam bills aren't legal tender.

It's also a moronic quote to apply to Bitcoin.

And Mastercard doesn't issue a silver card! Checkmate, big silver lobby!

"It's valuable because it used to be valuable"
Kind of supports the other guy's point...

Oooh, my two favorite "gold vs silver" fallacies back to back!
Pure silver, much like pure gold, does not tarnish. If you have silver that tarnishes, it's not pure!
Any more?

"Uhh... uhhh.... electronics conductors!"
Nah. Silver works just as well.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:29:09
Cool. Go to their office.
