lmao, I always lose those kinds of games.  I just find that if you think its in the anger depression area you are either seriously optimistic or a shill.  I still think the coin could hit over 6 figures.....but it can still hit $5 if the market crashes

sorry but im not following.  Is it one of those corny mind games where they want people to sell so the price goes even lower so they can buy it for cheaper?

wow, i'm actually mad at how dumb you are.  Where do you see a single iota of anger in that dudes comment??

How old are you? Serious question, trying to prove a point to a friend.  We literally had this conversation while stoned yesterday.  If your young it further proves my point.

Thats ok, I like it when they play hard to get.  You follow a man who went around the middle east with a group of twelve MEN!  you don't think they "prayed" all day do you? ;)

 Why would you think that?  An internet token is worth over $6k and you think we are near the bottom?  We can go much lower.  It was less than 1k 2 years ago.

My bad, I didnt realize you were an evangelical Christian.  
Either way, OP and the guy you replied to are two different users.  All he said was:


And risking capital is very easy.  It takes like 15 minutes and a bank account.
And maybe if fuckers like you stopped telling me what to do with my dick in public I wouldn't HAVE TO FUCKING RAGE!
