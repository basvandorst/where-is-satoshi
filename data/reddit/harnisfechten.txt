I don't know, I don't run a crypto-currency exchange. sorry bub, burden of proof is on you to prove that there's some conspiracy theory or ulterior motive for them doing it. You don't get to say "it's a conspiracy! they're doing it as part of a government plot to destroy bitcoin!" but then demand that I prove to you why it makes sense what they did. I don't know, don't care. The point being, it's not communism for a private business to decide not to offer a service. If you prove that they are in bed with government and it's a government intervention in the market, then I'll happily condemn it right alongside you.

McDonald's doesn't sell pasta. therefore, it's a conspiracy by government to stop people from buying pasta.
yeah, no. If they don't want to allow credit cards, that's their choice. It's not fucking communism. If you think government is making them do that, then prove it, I'd love to hear that proven.


that's not what protectionism is. A company choosing to not accept a payment method is not protectionism.

@_date: 2017-12-11 13:08:58
if BTC reaches the same level of popular usage as fiat, it might reach that point where it can be anonymous.
imagine some entrepreneur creating a product where you buy a little plastic card or something, like a pre-paid visa type of thing, but it has a chip on it that contains its own BTC wallet. So you send money onto it, and then you can just give someone the card. And there's no transfer of BTC to their wallet to track, you're physically handing them the wallet on that plastic card mimicking handing them cash. Sure there's a record of you taking money out of your personal wallet. But there's record of you withdrawing cash out of the bank the same way. And sure, if they deposit the money from that plastic card wallet into their personal wallet, that has a record, same as depositing cash. But the actual transaction from you to them is invisible since it was a physical transaction of a physical holder of currency, like cash.
and if you take that even further, those cards could become as common as fiat bills. So you'd leave a 20 mBTC card to pay for lunch + tip and the waitress would change you a 5 mBTC card in return.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:26:33
last time, it dropped to 8.6k and I now regret not buying up that dip. If it dips again to 9k or 10k or something, I'm buying more BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:35
really makes you wonder, some bloke out there had over 500k just sitting around that he felt comfortable just giving to someone else.
There's some latent millionaire out there with assets likely in the millions, possibly tens of millions, who invested a serious portion of their wealth in BTC.
Or, it's some guy who bought BTC back when it was 1$ and is cashing out big time lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:07
there does seem to be a minimum threshold. it's easy to see if we just take the extreme. If BTC magically crashed to 1$ a piece tomorrow, people would go nuts buying up so much BTC it would be insanity, servers would crash, and the price would skyrocket. YOu can imagine that the price would skyrocket so fast that it wouldn't even crash that low to begin with, as people go crazy buying even at 10$, or 100$, or 1000$. As BTC rises, that threshold increases. Now that it's hit over 16/17k, if it dipped as low as 10k again people would buy up tons of BTC being sold by the panic-sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:58:57
owning an asset that always increases in value over time is rarely a bad investment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:02
it doesn't need internet to create a private key seed.
Don't ask me more detail than that, I'm still learning too.
Basically, just like a trezor or ledger nano, it doesn't need internet connection to generate a bitcoin wallet seed/address. You generate the seed offline so that there's no chance of hackers or malware accessing it, then you grab the public master key from the offline wallet, and you can import that into an online PC installation of electrum to create a "watch only" wallet that just sees the balance of the wallet, can receive funds into the wallet via the public receive keys, etc. but can't actually access the funds in the wallet or anything. someone can "hack" your watch-only wallet and all they can do is send you money or just watch what you have.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:53
lol.....yes, I'm not some grand supreme dictator who wants to force everyone into the same ideology. chill.
I don't "decide" anything. I'm simply pointing out that statism is in opposition to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:41:48
only way a hardware wallet can be "hacked" is by straight up kidnapping you and torturing you into giving up the private keys.
In which case, there's NO form of currency that protects from that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:03
again, you're just stating definitions. Yes, someone with knowledge isn't the same as someone without knowledge. cool.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:33:00
you're still not explaining why it should be a crime. Saying "it doesn't sound like a free market" isn't an explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:00
I'm waiting for the next dip to put a bit more of my savings into it. But that's the thing. I could sell what I have now and make a tiny bit of a bonus. But whatever. If I lose it, it's not the end of the world. BUT.....if it takes off, if it ends up at 200k or something in a year's time, and I've been able to invest more than I currently have invested, it could make a big improvement for my life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:13:40
20$ per transaction????? wtf are they talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:12:43
meh. again, if you use different wallets and addresses, it's not much of a danger really. What would my neighbor find from the one address he gets from me when I sold him an old car? he'll see that I received BTC from him? He'll see that I transferred those funds somewhere else? And then what?
like I posted elsewhere, if BTC gets to the point of being used that often, we'll see more innovation. For example, imagine some smart guy inventing some sort of little card, like a plastic credit card with a chip, and it is a self-contained wallet and address that stores whatever amount on it. Like a pre-paid visa card. And stores would accept these as payment. So you could purchase ten 2 mBTC cards from your spending wallet. Then you could go for lunch and leave 10 mBTC on the table to pay for the bill, same as cash. No record of the transaction. Only record is when you take money out of your wallet, or when the other person puts money into their wallet, but there's nothing connecting the two of you and no record of the transaction. Same as handing them a 10$ bill under the table.
In the end, it won't be any different from other currencies. If you're concerned with privacy, there's ways to keep it all private. If you're not, it won't be THAT private.

maybe. people just joining the bandwagon will be weak and sell at the first sign of trouble. But here's the thing; say if out of every 10 newcomers, just one is a committed hodler. Sure, we might see a jump up, and then at the first sign of trouble, a massive dip as 9 people cash out. But we're still up one more person.
even if 99% of the gains are just hype, it's still gains.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:11:40
who knows, maybe he cashed out 3 years ago and is living in a mansion on an island somewhere with a different name and enjoying his life.
or maybe he now has 50 different wallet addresses with his BTC split between them all.
or maybe he died and his bajillions of dollars in BTC are forever lost to the market.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:39:39
the thing is, we don't know the scale of the bubble even if it is one.
what if the bubble will last 10 years, and see BTC hit 250k USD, and then crash to 10k 5 years later as some other cryptocurrency technology takes over.
at that point, it's not a bubble, it's just natural technological changes over time. VCRs went from valuable to trash. That's not a bubble, they just got replaced by better technology. It's quite possible that eventually bitcoin will be replaced by another crypto. so what. If you hold on to your BTC for 20 years, you're no different than someone who invested money in VCRs and then held onto it for decades.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:12:36
people who rise to the top of the hierarchy like that aren't after money. Their needs/wants for money were satisfied a long time ago.
most of them are likely sociopaths to some degree, as well as being very power hungry. They probably get off at night dreaming about how many people's money they have by the balls.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:35:46
that's why you don't invest more than you can afford to lose. I've invested an amount that would be disappointing, but not crushing if BTC totally crashed to 0$ forever tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:53:58
well that's the thing right. A dip causes three things:
1) panic among the weak, who panic sell because they think it's the habbenign and BTC is dead. This further drops the price.
2) day traders trying to make a quick buck, and cashing out before it dips further, to try and buy back when it's lower. amplifies the dip to an extent, then helps the recovery as they buy back
3) the hodlers who don't care if it dips 20-30%, if anything, they've gained a taste for blood, they're salivating at the chance to buy at a lower price because they've been hodling and have seen what happens if you stick it out, and are dying to put more money into it. They help the recovery and help mitigate the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:04:42

and why should having information that someone else doesn't be a crime?


are they not part of the public? So if they have the information, it's technically released to the public, it just isn't widely known. so what? and why should having an advantage be a crime? Does that mean some stock investor who has a good sense for when a business will take off should be a criminal because he has an advantage over some other idiot stock investor?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:30:23


in the end, any investment is just high-class gambling. Go take a look at some stock brokers and tell me they don't resemble the guys throwing around thousands at poker tables.

that being said, wanting to leave the rat race is a valid life goal. Problem is, you can't just leave it unless you want to be a hobo for a bit.

@_date: 2017-12-11 13:10:50
but as more people buy into it (even just to try and make money), the more popular it is, the more wealth is tied up in BTC, and the more incentive there is for places to accept BTC as currency. The motives for the popularity increase don't change that the popularity is increasing.
Sure, most of that popularity boost might be weak hands who sell at the first sign of trouble. But if just 1/10 of them becomes committed to the idea of cryptocurrency, it's a net gain.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:56:18

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:59:01

@_date: 2017-12-06 13:23:31
well yeah, it's useless hindsight. If I was able to have perfect knowledge of future investments I could have gotten rich any number of ways other than BTC.

it's true that a large part of it going up is because of people buying it expecting it to go up.
the problem is, at a certain point, when more and more people have their money invested in it, it doesn't matter the reason, the practical reality is that it starts to translate into actually being that valuable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:16
calling that "robbery" is wrong.
Me selling a stock and it thereby decreasing the value of your asset is not robbing you. It is not robbery. I owned the asset, I am allowed to sell it whenever I want and for whatever reason I see fit.

do you feel equally uncomfortable when you purchase some product that requires you to show ID? or when they take your credit card or debit card? or a cheque? or the fact that 100% of your money is 100% tracked right now by banks that work together with the fed?
even a basic wallet with Electrum or something like that uses multiple addresses. Who is going to know? And if you're worried, then just create a new wallet with a bunch of new addresses, and transfer your funds into it, and abandon the old wallet if you're that paranoid.
btc is many times more private that what we have now. Sure it's not perfect, but it's better. Right now your money is 100% tracked by government.

alternatively for newcomers who only have a couple hundred bucks in, you can sort of make your own hardware wallet with a usb stick and electrum.
get a clean usb stick, disconnect your pc from the internet and reboot it, scan for viruses, whatever.
insert usb stick, install electrum portable, create a wallet with a password or phrase or whatever. copy the master public key. remove usb stick, store in safe place.
reconnect pc to internet if you want. install electrum on pc. import the master public key as a watch-only wallet. Now you can use your internet-connected PC to receive BTC into your wallet, but the only way to remove BTC from the wallet is to access the USB, open electrum w/ the password, and access the private keys to verify a transaction outbound.

so last time BTC jumped rapidly up to 11.8k in a day, then saw a rapid drop down to 8.6k, followed by an equally rapid recovery back to around 10k. Since then, it slowly climbed back to 11k, and now just jumped up to almost 13k rapidly.
I wonder if we'll see the same trend and see it have a rapid wobble again. Maybe drop down to 10k again, and recover to 11.5k

either bitcoin is dying, or it's on the precipice of another massive bull run.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:32:10
fair enough. we'll see I guess
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:02:31
lol I realized the irony of what I said as I wrote it.
sure, too big to fail, but a different context from the government bailouts. I just meant that Bitcoin has momentum. What other alt-coin will take its place? People in the mainstream are just NOW beginning to know about Bitcoin. these other alt-coins have no chance to dethrone them. All they can do is market themselves as "like Bitcoin but totally better, we promise". Which is weak. Anybody new to cryptocurrency is almost guaranteed to be using bitcoin. The only people getting into the smaller more obscure cryptos are people who are diversifying from just having bitcoin and are interested in other technologies.
only way I see bitcoin going down is some sort of massive sweeping government legislation. I'm talking -communist-China-style outright banning of any website or ISP that deals with bitcoin websites. But we've all seen how the anti-piracy legislation has worked. Hell, piratebay is still up and running, after all these years, and being the most well-known pirating website. All these years, all that publicity, all the government legislation, and you can still visit piratebay and download the newest game or movie.
the longer bitcoin rises and grows, the less likely it's "just a bubble". The housing bubble in the 2000's didn't last very long.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:02:04
everyone sell and cash out so the price drops so I can buy in again at a lower price before we hit 20k
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:27:26
I get what you're saying, but lack of trust in an exchange service is not the same as lack of trust in the currency itself. Some sort of exchange website like that is just as untrustworthy for storing USD or Cambodian riels as it is for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:34
a billion what? You think BTC will hit $1,000,000,000?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:55:06
that's a good response.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:23:15
rippling bans for trading bitcoin?
what, were banks and utility companies banning you from using them because they found out you used bitcoin????
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:24
yeah, it could easily be an influx of people both buying the dip and selling before a further dip.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:09:39
it's true. People hear "omg one bitcoin costs 8000$? that's crazy!" because they're imagining as if one bitcoin is the equivalent of a "dollar" or "pound" or "ruble" or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:14:16
I bought at around 10k today. glad to be part of the community now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:29:17
I'm not very code-savvy, I know my way around computers but I'm not as knowledgeable as most people here, but I do understand this.
Bitcoin has a brand now. Even 'normies' know about bitcoin. it has entered mainstream consciousness. Nobody else but people involved in it know what the hell a dogecoin is, or etherium, or whatever else. but bitcoin is known. If the layperson decides to get into crypto, they are more likely to go for the one they know about rather than get sold on "hey buy this alt-coin, it's like bitcoin but totally better!".
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:17:13
and spending 10$ on the game today instead of buying 10$ of bitcoin which in the future would be 300$ is no different. lol.
by that logic, everyone should just buy nothing and eat only ramen noodles and put everything in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:18:31
or just don't use bitcoin directly on ebay. cash out some BTC for USD on a paypal account or something.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:08:19
a nurses job is as valuable as the amount of money someone is willing to pay them to do it. period.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:00:25
if someone that mainstream and worshipped by young sciencophiles was to endorse bitcoin, you'd see the value jump overnight by insane amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:43
aaaaand BTC is right back up to 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:19:56
it's sort of freaky. Like it makes you wonder if this time next year we'll be hitting 100k or something.
There's always that part of me screaming about "but what if it all comes crashing down". But it starts to get so big that you can't even imagine how it would crash like that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:36












@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:38
I'm seriously laughing at anyone who panic sold at 8k. They're screwed lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:32
this was a very wise post in light of the recent flash crash and recovery over the past hour.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:23:17
don't most people into crypto-currency recommend not storing large sums in online exchanges, but rather to only use offline/hardware/cold wallets for long-term storage, and use exchanges just for small amounts of trading money?

right......so why should two people be paid the same for different work?

@_date: 2017-11-21 15:10:33
lol you're saying that this grand and noble decentralization of human finance and currency is too serious for memes?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:39:02
what was really funny was how started celebrating 10k when it was already at 11k, and then it crashed to 8600, the media picked up on it, ran stories about "omg massive bitcoin crash", and it recovered back to 10k minutes later.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:58:26
jumped to 20k, crashed to just under 3k. if we jump to 50-60k, we might crash down to less than 10k
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:21:50
people have decades, if not centuries, of trust for banks built into them. It's just a fact of life that you can trust banks. Even when issues happen, people just ignore them as exceptions and don't shake that trust in the bank.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:06:02
consider: it jumped from ~1000$ at the start of the year, and it will be over 10k by the end of the year. that's 10x.
If you get in now, it could easily be over 100k by next December.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:43:36
like I said. a nurses job is worth whatever someone is willing to pay them to do it.
the money is just a placeholder. it's just acts as an exchange medium. But what it represents is an exchange. So basically, a nurses job is worth whatever someone else is willing to trade them in exchange for doing it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:49:06
yeah. But then again, 99% of people have shit understanding of any economics or investing. I myself don't even have a great understanding of investing, and only a little better on economics, and I constantly find myself explaining shit to people.
just the other day I had to explain to someone what it means when gold has been steady value for thousands of years. Their first response was "no, it fluctuates like everything else, when I was young the price per ounce was a lot less than it is now", and I had to explain that it was largely because of inflation of the USD not of gold, and then they protested about how they've seen the gold price dip and increase over years, and there's points where if you were to buy a pound of gold one day, a year later you'd lose money. I had to explain to him that it's not about value of gold measured in USD, but in buying power.
Analogy I used was if he found out that he had an ancestor from 200 years ago that put away his life's savings in cash to save for him, it would be maybe 20 bucks. Or, practically worthless today vs life's savings 200 years ago. Compared to if he put away his life's savings worth of gold 200 years ago, today, that amount of gold that he bought would still be a "life's savings" worth of gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:04:32
as someone new to BTC, how is anyone making any sorts of predictions? 5-10% is nothing, but some people are saying it'll drop down to 10k or 5k again in the next month. How is anyone getting any idea of this? How do we know it's not just the beginning of an exponential rise to 500k, where it might drop back down to 200k? How do we know it won't sit at 11k for the next 6 months?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:01:19
that sandwich you bought last year for 5$? it really cost you 500$ if you had invested that money in BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:06:25
I always get uncomfortable when this starts. it's like everyone builds the hype to try and pump up the price, and it skyrockets, and then collapses again. I would prefer a slow steady rise rather than the crazy up and down swings.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:31:05
I know people joke about "hurr durr congrats on taking Econ101", but seriously, highschool should have a course in basic personal finances that covers credit cards, savings, budgeting, and basic economics. Of course, good luck getting the "basic economics" part without someone complaining it's biased somehow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:56:35
limited maximum supply of bitcoins, increasing difficulty of being mined to create new ones, and increasing utility (more places accepting payment, more legitimized, etc), and more demand for it.

I bought some at around 12k, and more around 17k I think. At this point, why would I sell? I'll just hodl the hell out of it. I already consider it lost money. And in 5 years if BTC is worth 80k, I'll be laughing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:10:03
there will be a bottom. put it this way, everyone remembers the potential to reach thousands/tens of thousands of dollars. If it ever dropped to say, 50$/btc, I would throw some money at it just to get a couple of BTC and say screw it, see what happens.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:02:40
sure, but if it doesn't do that, it's not a big deal.
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:03:33
wait what?
so they are going to buy bitcoins using russian currency, and then use those bitcoins to buy gold? What the hell are they trying to say?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:13:04
maybe. such is the game we all play.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:51:53
I bought in November at 9k and in December at 12k, didn't sell any when it hit 19k, and didn't buy any when it dipped to 7k because other expenses took priority.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:59:26
it's strange to me. all the signs point up. countries opening up exchanges, LN seeming to be working well, it seems like all good news.
but people keep panic selling.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:36
that's the idea.
all the people selling are probably all the people who were just bandwagoners jumping on the November craziness
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:40:48
best way to do it.
I bought in at roughly 12k last year. went a bit crazy when it jumped to 20k, then got mad when it kept dropping down. The past 9 months or so, I just don't pay attention. I check the price maybe once a week, just to see.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:57:16
I don't get why people would downvote this.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:56:07
this isn't economics, this is day trading and trying to predict futures. lol.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:28:12
congratulations for cementing your losses by selling.
when it's back to 10k in a year from now, or 50k in 3 years, you'll be crying about how much you lost.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:17
well, yes, exactly. that's what I'm saying. bandwagoners hopped on, price skyrocketed, and they all ditched at the first spook

cell phones are providing access to those billions without internet.
it's going to be easier for some African guy in the congo to get a cell phone and create a btc wallet than it will be for him to get a bank account in the jungle.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:40:53
coinbase is easy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:16:07
that's the risk we all take.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:42:38
because we're still in the initial adoption phase. so there's still this massive untouched potential for the value to grow.
fast forward ten years and after some initial wobbliness, maybe it settles in at say, 50k, and steadily rises by 5% every year (complete made up number, whatever), then it will become more stable to rely on as currency.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:25:39
right, and that's because of the current potential for it to increase in value by large amounts.
If the value stabilizes and only increases by a tiny but consistent portion each year, it will start being spent as currency. Just like gold.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:36:54
it'll happen eventually as it gets more widespread.

@_date: 2018-02-14 14:20:05
no. Last time it skyrocketed to 20k just because of hype and people pushing it higher just to make a quick buck. I'd prefer a long and steady growth rather than boom and bust cycles.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:37:50

meh. it is painful. I didn't have a huge amount in anyways, and I'm in the red now anyways. Might as well just hold on for the long haul.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:41:16
that's what I'm saying. This slower steadier growth is better. People getting excited again saying "OMG MAYBE 10k BY SUNDAY" are being silly.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:03:53
it's true. it used to be that "internet" was for computer science nerds and brilliant programmers to screw around with code and sending messages to each other. Insanely high barrier of entry, very low public usage.
Bitcoin is there right now. Even for someone with above average computer skills and knowledge, it's tricky getting into bitcoin and setting it all up.
We need to imagine the future in 10 or 20 years when cryptocurrency will be at the level of how grandmas now have facebook accounts and post hashtags and emojis to their friends from a cellphone or facetime with their grandkids.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:51:48
of course. I'm debating doing the same myself. I might just hold and wait for the upswing, I don't want to get caught selling at say 7k and then getting stuck rebuying at 10k or something.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:46:15
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:35:17

@_date: 2019-05-17 13:21:29
that's true. was just throwing numbers out, but yeah. new ATH of a couple hundred k and crash to 60 sounds reasonable.
just need to remind myself to sell some if it hits 400k lol
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:44:42
hindsight is 20-20 lol. yeah sure, I wish I put 1000$ into BTC when it was worth 5 cents, then I'd be a billionaire now. Obviously.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:22:59
if it followed the same exact pattern (it probably won't) it would maybe get to 12k by the end of 2019, with a bull run to say, 80-100k at the end of 2020, followed by a crash/bear market down to 15k
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:18:08
I have a pitiful 0.047 BTC, but if it was ever worth 6 figures I'd just dump most of it because the amount of debt it could pay off (mortgage, school, etc) would far outweigh the benefits of hodling. at the point where cashing out would drastically change your life, that's the tipping point for me.
that's not to say I'd get totally out, or that I'd never buy back in. I believe in the concept in itself, not just as a stock market game
