i doubt bitcoin will overtake fiat as world currency but in time it will work hand in hand like email to postal service and web pages to newspaper. idk who said it maybe ashton kutcher in the steve jobs movie on netflix but computers are supposed to be a natural extension of a person so the internet and everything about it from web pages email bitcoin etc should be ways to utilize the extension to better a persons life? idk my 2 cents are up./

im not tech savvy or know much about anything but what if whistleblowers use a disposable laptop and and leak documents through the blockchain using the same methods as that ppl who are working on blockchain world citizenship. idk maybe make an onion site where membership would broadcast the keys needed to read the docs leaked on the blockchain? sounds kind of impractical i guess.

figured the govt would accuse the 1st person who tries to spread the info from the blockchain, maybe try and jail the person for treason or something but what if a corporate entity were to spread the info through social media first. a corporation that relies on consensus so that everyone involved would have a voice and essentially could be considered co ceo or something that way any indictment would have to target the corporate body made of lets say thousands of ppl instead of singling out one person. idk maybe they shut down the made up corp but as michael scott would say, shut me down and ill just create another company, i have thousands of names.
