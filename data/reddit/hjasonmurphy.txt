Core dev team agreed to a segwit 2x type deal (HKA) two years ago then decided not to implement it. NYA is just trying to catch up on what was agreed upon then. If it had been implemented as planned we may not have lost 40% of the marketshare. I just want what is best for BTC and I think this is it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Unfortunately in this subreddit I don't think both sides get provided equally. I hope those new to Bitcoin take the time to look at the arguments on both sides and make an educated decision on the technology. Take the ideology out, take the egos out. Decide for yourself... Then whatever decision you make I will respect. I just ask for the same.

How are there different clients running the same consensus rules on the network now then? Many teams with good ideas on open source projects can be a good thing. Time to work together.

It is huge! Best of all you can fill your TFSA with it.  Hello Tax free gains.

I am running btc1 and look forward to the 2X fork. I believe in sidechains and LN but is no reason to limit on-chain transactions. Whether the limit is being hit at the moment or not those sidechains will require a larger block. Let's not limit BTC to a settlement layer but make it everythingit can be.

Devs aren't Bitcoin. Devs, users, businesses... We all have a stake in this.

I do believe in sidechains but if BTC is going to become as popular for use as I would like it to 1MB will not be enough. A 2MB upgrade (a little more later) allows time for the sidechains to be developed and deployed and allows BTC to continue to grow until they are available for use. I believe a larger than 1MB block will be required anyway.

Now

I like Bitcoin Cash for different reasons. I don't think I am alone... maybe in comparison to the number of people that actually comment on this subreddit but not overall. Too many live in their echo chambers; I try to read all views and make my own educated decisions.
I don;t want to throw away the dev team but from what I have been following over the past 2+ years the Core dev team did not fulfill their agreement two years ago. I would like the talented memebers of the Core dev team to continue on and work with the 2x team. I believe that to be in the best interest of BTC and that is what I care about... not egos.

I am. It says it right on the page. I have been waiting for this to get approved since it was announced. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:22:37
Huh? I am saying let's not limit it to a settlement layer. Plus I don't think 1MB is large enough even if it was only a settlement layer in the future.

I am running a full node... Not just wallet. You do not need to run a full node to dump your coins. To answer your question, yes I do understand how it works.

This does not deserve a response 
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:22:09
Not against segwit but I also do not believe that allowing the blockade to grow even larger will cause the issues that some claim. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:46:20
I am not saying it is not better than PayPal or a bank but it is not as good as it can be. An average of 5 minutes is too long to buy a coffee and that is why we need side chains and other solutions eventually but these fees prevent micro-transactions which prevents much of the world from using it. I don't believe that BTC was created just for some... It was created for all and with the proper scaling it will be able to be used by all. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:10:29
Agreed... Also better than a week, month or year. I would like to see the transactions get in the next block (average 5 minutes). This is what we could have if we scaled properly. I believe we will need side chains etc in the future but let's have a good plan and scale. People around the world need BTC now and cannot afford the fees. We need a larger block size and it needs to be able to grow. The rest will come as it becomes mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:12:26
Exactly... You can afford more and so can I but BTC was created to revolutionize currency for all and if you were in many places in South America or Africa then you can no longer use BTC. Let's make BTC available to all.

Please show proof of empty block mined? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:13:33
I quickly browsed results and saw articles from 2016 and earlier... please point me to a block in 2017 that was empty.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:56:29
After 7 blocks... So an hour to get confirmed. Does that sound like the system we want? It could be so much more. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:01:26
I don't think it will die either... But it can be a lot of things and I am not sure why it is being limited.
