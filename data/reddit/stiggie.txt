In life, it's far easier to criticize.
Olympic swimmer finishes last? Suddenly he's the worst swimmer in history. Nevermind all the years of training and winning other competitions that led up to this moment.
Look at politics anno 2016. Blaming others. Really? What have YOU done to help? Exactly, nothing, or even worse, most are part of the problem to begin with.
Never waste time on people that can only criticize, they are never part of the solution and most of the time part of the problem to begin with.

And I wrote a DM with a sob story and got nothing ... oh well. At least my story was TRUE

It is absolutely mind blowing that that the world has built the largest global single-state machine in just a few years. What are we using it for? Simply securing state for a super tiny amount of data in an immutable logfile?
I think we need to provide miners with a "way out" where they can keep using the hardware. I like the proposal CognIOTA is taking, distributed machine learning tasks built on top of IOTA (see this from yesterday's AMA by the IOTA team 
I do realize I'm preaching to r/bitcoin but I also believe most people still remember some of the promises of the past : helping the developing world with trust and helping the unbanked. Right now everything is al about quickest gains possible and a few are getting super rich and most promises are forgotten. 
Let's repurpose this incredible machine we've built for good and call it the global cloud computer.

Look, you don't have to convince me that a distributed ledger is better. I agree with you.
If you think proof of stake is centralized because you lose incentive to run a node, think about this : who is running a node now? Exactly.
I think you need to take a look at IOTA because theirs is the cleanest proof of stake method. You don't have to stake a share, your stake is proven in that you validate other people's transactions first, before you get to do yours. If you don't have a stake in the network being up, simply don't use it. If you want to stage an attack, you're only making the network faster. Sure a coordinator is needed right now to prevent spam because the network simply is too small. This is just smart tactics in the bootstrap face. You could've done multiple 50%+ attacks in bitcoin's first few years if you just had the hardware and the incentive at that point in time.

Yeah, you're gonna need them millions if you want to pay for all the electricity usage just for getting one transaction on the chain.

I'd like to propose my favorite non profit organization: **[CoderDojo](
*The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that it’s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.
To that end, they’ve built a global network of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.*
.. this is the PR I copy pasted from the website. If you want more info, there is a lot to find, but I'd like to shine some light on my own experiences with CoderDojo in my home country Belgium.
I've been a monthly volunteer for a few years now. It all started when I went there with my kids aged 7 &amp; 9 at the time. Most people know me to be pretty interested in geeky stuff, so of course my kids have always been surrounded by tech and techy toys. The thing that drew me to CoderDojo was the promise of an environment where my kids would be motivated to learn more about computers and actually start to program, as I've been doing for job now for 15 years. 
It turned out to be so much more. First of all it has elevated the interest of my kids for tech above anything I could ever hope for. My son for instance went from just gaming to Lego Mindstorms to programming in Python. He's now started his junior high in STEM at the ripe old age of 11 (yes he skipped ahead 1 year). And he's doing great. Already my house is strewn full of little projects, currently he's working on a pinball machine.
Second, it has taught my younger daughter that yes, it is perfectly normal to be interested in all the things her brother loves as she has found peers in the group. It has come to a point were she no longer feels a lot of pressure from the girls in her class to act girly. She is incredibly smart, even smarter than my boy and I love when she gets excited when she's creating things. Could be legos or in Scratch.
Third. It has proven to me that there are a lot of people in tech that truly love their jobs and want to spread this to the next generations. Our monthly gathering has seen teenagers grow up into very capable coaches as well. Some kids aged 17 now are explaining things to 7 years old with such a level of respect and care. I'd love for my kids to be as responsible and motivated in the future. It truly is an inspiring place and it brings out the best of all people involved.
The one thing that does concern me is that people with limited funds tend to fall out of the loop and some parents think you need to be geeky as well to even send your kids to CoderDojo. We want all kids to enjoy computers and code!
We have a lot of support from the industry in Belgium. Martine Tempels, founder of CoderDojo Belgium and head of Telenet Business (biggest ISP in BE) has been a driving force for this. But companies can only do so much. We have plenty of tech (Mindstorms robots, arduino, raspberry pi, Minecraft servers, ...) but sometimes we'd want to offer kids more. Some kids don't have a Minecraft account so they can't join. Some kids don't have a descent computer to bring so they have to share or use old library PC's (not a problem for the young kids, but teenagers feel they need to have a gaming laptop to join, which is ridiculous). We used to have free pizza because kids tend to get hungry after a few hours and our monthly dojo takes place just before noon, but we had to stop due to limited sponsoring. 
CoderDojo will forever be free to all participants and all volunteers work for free (except a few people in Belgium that organize everything, paid for directly by the industry). I'd love to be able to hand over a check and maybe start a travelling crypto-class to teach older kids about the tech. Any donation would be very welcome. Most months we have close to 50 kids present and we have tip jar that gets maybe 50 euros, which we use now to provide free drinks and fruit or cookies. 
One problem : I have no idea how to get bitcoins to them. I can always contact our national office and ask, but given the nature of our organization, they'd probably say "you'll set something up, right?". If you want to donate; I'll set up a wallet and I'll let our organization put the address on their social media channels and website. If this doesn't catch any upvotes, no worries, I'll still talk about blockchain tech some day in the future at one of our dojos. Thank you for your support!

Way to (re)launch a magazine. This will SURELY sell. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:19:38
On Steam at least for me it was not instant. I've used it multiple times and had to wait close to 10 minutes before the sale was actually approved. Payment went through immediately, but my account did not show the purchased items until many minutes later.

If they were trying to exploit this, they would have changed the original headline by now to reflect the current findings.

I love how you correctly put " **Virtually no other alt\-coin can compete with these costs.** " in your post, because that's indeed the truth. There are other coins that can compete with these costs and there are those that are free.

Health care costs close to nothing. Some examples: My father in law recently had an accident and had to have reconstructive surgery to his left index finger. Costed him less than €50. Myself I need medication for a hearth condition. I take pills every day. They cost me a grand total of €4,32 a year.
We have one of the best school systems. I recently learned the average costs for parents are around €1000 a year. Government pays around €150000 per child from kindergarten until finishing high school.
I have 32 paid vacation days free to choose and 10 paid holidays. Sick leave is paid as well. I recently took 2 months off from work to have time for the kids during summer and got a replacement income from the government. 
Also actually I drive a company car and don't need to pay a cent for it. But still ... 
I was in SF once. Food is cheap and portion sizes are large. Most other things are pretty much the same as in Europe.

Now send a micro transaction, like say $0.0001 of total worth.
Now do it once a second.
Now do this for millions of devices all over the planet.

I'm always weary of sms based 2FA systems. I'm not technically proficient enough in telecom technology to know for sure, but my trust in them is pretty low. This is just another confirmation for me.

Now I just hope they start accepting dogecoin

What they're actually doing is integrating [bitpay]( To them it's just another payment method to implement. Just like they implemented credit card and other online payment methods. You must remember that Mobile Vikings operates solely on the internet, so this comes quite naturally.
I'm pretty sure conversion is straight to fiat with daily or multiple daily bank transfers from bitpay to mobile vikings. The conversion rate EUR -&gt; BTC is calculated upon checkout by bitpay and bitpay gets a slice of the cake. 
I'm not against this, I just don't think it's such a big deal. If however they hold on to the bitcoin and eventually start paying bills or wages with bitcoin, then I'll be impressed.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:14:06
I agree this is a necessary step. I just want to point this out, because some people may miss this information. In the end it will be cheaper to just accept bitcoin in your own wallet. But the risk now is mitigated by the payment processors.
