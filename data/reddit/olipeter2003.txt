You Bob and Fred go out for drinks all the time. You guys alternate paying. At some point you decide to keep track of who buys beers for who over time to try to make things fair.
 You each keep a notebook that matches showing who has bought a beer for who. You decide that you each get 10 beers you can always use to get one of the other guys to buy you a beer. 
That way nobody owes more than 10 beers. So when you buy Bob and Fred a beer, you write in each of your notebooks that you have 12, Bob has 9, and Fred has 9. This works great for a while until one day there are more than 30 beers in the notebooks. 
Now you all have to get out your notebooks, go back over time, to figure out who got the extra beer, and from where. You have to go back weeks, it takes forever. 
So you decide from now on you will have your buddy Fred check each notebook every week to make sure they match, then laminate the pages so nobody can go back and change them. 
You all together pay Fred 1 beer a week for this service, you also let Fred add one extra beer  to his account from nowhere until 10 more beers are created. 40 for 4 people. 
10 beers per person and That way if there is ever a dispute you only have to look at the last week to find the mistake.
Beer = Bitcoin
Notebook = block chain
Laminated page = block
Fred = miner
Beer you pay Fred = miners fee
Beer Fred makes from nowhere, only until 10 new beers are created = block reward.

You being wealthy and everybody being able to transfer value more easily will not suddenly make a majority of people agree with your politcal ideology. It will likely change their financial ideology, people will save instead of borrow. I think the economy will be better for it. Bitcoin essentially allows you to run a cash business online. Many of these businesses will choose to pay their taxes in full anyway. Some businesses will refuse to pay taxes, some of them will get away with it, and some of them will be caught and prosecuted. The government will not be unable to collect any taxes and citizens will not give up on the idea of a majority controlled civilization

Nobody has to be encouraged to spend their coin's There will be things that these people will want or need, wich will only cost them a small percentage of their holdings.

If they plan to profit on  PPV , Itunes hulu and netflix, shouldn't they be willing to invest?  I would back if they released the film free to all, or put up a some of their own money for production.

@_date: 2013-04-11 17:40:57
If you invested without a plan for every scenerio you never should have invested. Obviously you did not plan to sell once the price dropped, did you really deem it impossible for the price to return to the price of last week? If you did not sell you lost nothing. This post really makes no sense you claim you bought in with 10 years worth of pay all in the one or two days it was high. Then sold the next day while the exchange was all but broken. I don't beleive anybody smart enough to have 10 years sallary in equity savings or credit would be stupid enough to panic buy after a 1 week double then sell all the next day at half its value. This post has a 99÷ chance of being bullshit.

You have a public address and a private key. Your app will show you your public key, you can give this out to anybody as long as you don't mind them knowing how many BTC you have in that wallet. Your app will not display your private key but you can back it up to a micro sd card for storage somewhere else in case you lose your phone. I would feel pretty safe storing daily spending money on the phone, but android exploits are a possibility and so is physical theft. These sites are technically legit but in reality offer unspendably small amounts of btc for huge amounts of time. The best way to get btc is selling something, handmade used or new for the right price it will likely sell on bitmit. Good luck and I hope you enjoy experimenting with bitcoins.

This would be a difficult case to bring to court, and probably would not be worth it directly even if you won.

Showing the world that a bitcoin thief can be caught due to the power of the blockchain would be a huge boon to bitcoins growth.

Video cards are no longer relevant. ordering asics is extremely risky because nobody knows how much the difficulty will rise in the next few months before you receive your miner. Those who say you will always lose money are just guessing the same as those who say you will always make money. It also seems anybody who already has an asic or an order for one is trying to discourage everybody else in their own self interest. It is true that mining is no longer for everybody and you will need to learn a lot before jumping into it. But hey if you have money to lose it sure beats satoshi dice.

I admit I don't know much about coding. So you are saying a lack of documentation makes it difficult or impossible to create a new competing miner or client that would not fork the blockchain? I find that somewhat suprising, but couldn't you just adapt theirs and change the default settings like dust and transaction fees. And promote it as an alternative to delegitamise the foundation. As i see it this foundation only has legitimacy because nobody else is coding and promoting well sofware updates.

So why cry about it here? I do not want you persicuted but I don't expect tax laws to change because bitcoin exists. If you can get away with not paying your taxes go for it. I am not stupid or too much of a coward to stand up to my government. I simply choose to have political effect by respectfully debating people on specific issues instead of burning it all to the ground. There is no religious war. You are not being persicuted.

I feel like the anti government sentiment in this video is unnecessary, and speaks to what should be only a small part of bitcoin on a world scale. I agree that I would rather have the government not devalue my money, and certainly don't think we should be at war, but saying bitcoin will enable us to defund the government is an extreme and dangerous claim. I am a bitcoin user who is proud to pay my taxes. I will use my vote and my political voice to change my government for the better. I hope i am not alone in this, because if I am it makes a government attack on bitcoin extremely likely. I really do like the video thanks for linking it.

It was not created specifically for anything people may use it however they see fit. If somebody wants to use it to day trade within the current system that is a great use, and has no effect on your ability to use it how you choose.

Ok that's a good point predicting absolutes is silly. It is extremely unlikely that the government will be unable to collect any taxes and that people will give up on majority controlled government, while either of us are still alive. Better?

Don't act like your not a double digit percent of that as well.

Ok I guess Make your own foundation is kind of a dumb response. I guess my point is that really I don't think bitcoin foundation destroy's any principles. They are simply a group of people doing what is in their own interest, and claim that this aligns with with bitcoin's interests as a whole, they probably don't align perfectly but I have yet to see any clear evidence they have abused their power as the main software updater and I believe if they tried most people would not update. I think bitcoin will survive some capitalists doing what is in their best interest and if it can't it was doomed from the start.

Yeah I don't really get why anarchists think the idea of bitcoin is somehow synonymous with their political ideology. Bitcoin is a financial instrument, it isn't some political movement.

During the two days without fees I learned I am too weak willed to day trade, oh well.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:15:02
fair enough. My point is certainty in predictions is a really bad thing, you should consider every possibility. You should say if the value is over 100000$ in 5 years, or even it is likely the value will be over 100000$ in five years.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:41:31
There is no market and the value has never been verified.

They just happen to be a particularly honest scam. They take your money with little chance of return.

No but it could have been under valued, it could still be under valued. We don't know for sure but I am willing to bet on it.

Is New Mexico taken? I better get on this.

They can't they don't have any money.

If I had this level of self control i would be 20 pounds lighter, and not be addicted to energy drinks. Good luck friend.

My point is you are not being persecuted and there is no war happening.

If you are not selling or spending now the price doesn't matter to you now.
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:08:23
Thank you!

thanks I will consider using this.

Don't use QT software, and don't donate. They are a Private organization who registered a domain name, if some of us use their software and choose to donate that is up to us. Start a competitor nobody is holding you back.

The IRS would have to investigate the way they do now with tax evasive cash businesses.

that certainly does help. So if I and all the students have the app they could all display a QR code on their screens, and i could go from student to student scanning QR with my phone and sending them the ammount i determine one at a time, that seems like it should be quick enough, thanks.

You will need to spend money for things you cannot survive without. You will spend what you consider a small percentage of your savings on something you really want.
