If you bought bitcoin just a year ago and held it, you lost about 67% of your savings.  If you are concerned about inflation, bitcoin is not for you, either.  Currency is supposed to be a medium of exchange, not an investment.

I think you are entirely ignoring the whole "rubber hose cryptanalysis" problem.  Governments have armies and weapons, and they can most certainly make you pay taxes whether or not you want to.

I think your post illustrates perfectly why most people who are not hyper-libertarian nutjobs are turned off by Bitcoin.


Crazy libertarian conspiracy theories? Check.


Wild, completely ludicrous fantasies? Check.
Reality check: the US government isn't going to accept your tax bill in bitcoins, and the value of the US dollar doesn't change by 5% in a day.  Bitcoin isn't going to be replacing fiat currency anytime soon.  The fact that it's deflationary will naturally self-limit that process (if the value is rising, it will be hoarded instead of being spent).  You would have to be crazy to either borrow or lend money denominated in bitcoin over the long term (e.g. 30 years), which also makes it quite impractical as a currency.

Gold is a commodity.  You can use it to make jewelry, plate circuit boards, make fine wire, and use it for all sorts of other things.  Because of that, it has intrinsic value, and its price will never go to zero.  It's not an investment (for the reason you noted), but it is an asset (like any other commodity).  You don't invest in commodities, you speculate on them.  But they can act as a store of value.
Bitcoin is worth something only because it is a useful medium of exchange.  Apart from that, it has no value whatsoever.  In a way, it's much like a fiat currency, but without government backing and with a fixed supply.  Its price is set purely by the day-to-day balance of supply and demand, and if demand ever drops to zero (e.g. if another cryptocurrency takes over), its value will go to zero as well.

In the US, it's free to withdraw from your own bank's ATMs, or other banks it has agreements with.  Other ATMs usually charge around $2.  Most banks have fairly extensive ATM networks, so it's rarely a problem.  Many banks will also reimburse you for the fees (e.g. ones with smaller ATM networks).

To the extent that bitcoin is supposed to be an easy-to-use payment platform, the security difficulties *are* a major flaw that seriously inhibits adoption.  Online wallets eliminate most of the advantages bitcoin has over services like Paypal, since they are not anonymous and do not protect you from counterparty risk.

Well, if you pay them $2 for taking out the trash, $0.09 is about 5% of the transaction.

Unfortunately, suing someone doesn't magically conjure up money.  Especially if they are both broke and stupid.

Actually, according to FinCEN, they are:


It's not in the link, but this stuff only becomes relevant for amounts &gt;$1000/person/day.  So as long as your localbitcoins transactions are &lt; $1000 each and you have a system for making sure one person doesn't exceed that per day, you most likely don't need to register.

Also this: 


So basically, if you acquire Bitcoins and resell them to other people, you need to be registered as an MSB with FinCEN and follow appropriate state regulations.  Or you might get busted and go to jail / lose all your money.

LOL.  Good luck with that.  The reason WU and Moneygram can charge their fees is because the licensing hurdles are damn near insurmountable.  AML/KYC/licensing requirements make it impossible for small entities to operate in this business.
Also, it's a fairly competitive, low-margin business that has at least 3 large players (WU, Moneygram, Ria) and dozens of smaller ones.  You can send $2500 to the Philippines for $2.99 via WU.  That's a 0.12% fee, and zero currency exchange (or any other) risk.  Good luck doing that with Bitcoins or anything else.  There isn't a problem here that needs solving.
