Bags to heavy? So ur saying a CEO of one of the biggest exchange in Canada , that holds almost 200 million dollars didn't have a backup plan . If u don't see anything suspicious in this ur in denial or clueless. My backup plan would have a backup plan ...  On top of that where's the body ? 200 million is enough to start a new life 100x over

At this moment if someone sells 10 billion on the  market it will drop Bitcoin a lot. We do no have enough liquidity for a 10 billion dollar Bitcoin sell . That's like 13% of Bitcoin total market cap . Also it isn't a stupid question if u are legitimately asking. Other guy just bitter he lost in the market
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:04:37
Honestly if this happens there's worse things to worry about then bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:33:48
That's why cryptocurrency was invented.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:41:30
I'm very optimistic about crypto I like the idea of one country United but I don't think human as a species is evolved enough to do so . As of that I  am an American and I'll die an American .
