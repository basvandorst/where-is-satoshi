Maybe you should read the *entire* thread to understand why it was closed. I do agree, however, that the moderator should have expressed sentiments shared after the closure prior.

I just wonder how many people will read this topic without prior context of what we mean by "orphans".

This is your opinion.
Bitcoin classic is a hard fork, and plans to continue developing Bitcoin after the fork . Which repository do you think people will care about *once* the majority switch to this hard fork?
Truth is, miners and major stakeholders are tired of this debate, and have agreed on a solution: raise the block limit to 2MB. Even if Core merges this change afterwards, I doubt people will want to switch back to Core.
The only thing Core seems to have going for it is competent developers. I'm curious to see how many of those will contribute to Classic, and how many more others will contribute when they feel they have a chance of having their PRs merged, or at least a proper discussion on the topic.
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:02:55
I wouldn't be surprised if it were submitted and closed on core already.
As you may already know, Core doesn't have a good reputation with handling controversial pull requests very smoothly. That may have prompted them to submit it to Classic so a fresh discussion could be had.
Note that Classic has a website to openly gauge sentiment on new features, if people were against it, it would be within their best interest not to merge it.

That's a convenient definition, and sets a dangerous precedent. It makes Blockstream Bitcoin's BDFL.

Ths thread looks to be a case of 1 person 4 Reddit accounts.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:06:17
I don't think there is a consensus on that topic. Most people in that thread disagree with the PR.
Just because someone submitted a pull request doesn't mean it will be implemented, or anyone else agrees that it should be implemented.

Not entirely true. They *may* report your account as "Suspected fraud activity," which happens more often than you think.

Seems like a good deal of effort was put into this. I'll definitely read and comment on your methodology and implementation shared on Github more closely.
There is one potential flaw I see with this experiment—that is, your hypothesis assumes that people aren't purposely changing their writing style, or mimicing another's writing style when using different accounts to throw off any detection. I would mention this caveat in the problem statement or conclusion your paper. Aside from that, it looks good at first glance.
Hope others are able to peer review.
Thanks for sharing.

General Advice:
Don't put in money than you're willing to lose when investing in risky/unstable markets.
Before investing in anything, as a sanity check I ask myself "if I lost 100% of what I put in, how would it affect my life?" I recommend you do the same.

"17 The curve 𝜌̅demand differs slightly from the curve 𝜌demand. The latter represents the empirical demand measureable from a miner’s mempool, while the former represents the traditional demand curve that is less quantifiable (the demand that would exist if the price was different)."
"Measureable" should be spelt Measurable.

The website looks decent. I recommend removing the barrier of asking for first and last name in the sign up form. I also recommend linking to the privacy policy and terms and conditions on the home page since you make reference to them (on mobile).
If what  said is true. This PR stunt could backfire.

Thanks. You can ask for name after they've signed up.

I see a few security issues with this product.
One being that you have to authenticate with their service before creating a wallet, which means data is sent to a server somewhere; also, you have to trust their authentication scheme. I was expecting a self-contained web app that connects to Bitcoin directly, which wouldn't have these security issues.
The nice thing about web apps that work completely in the browser so that you can check the source code to ensure no funny business is occurring—this is much harder to do for an Android or iOS app. This leads me to the next issue, there is a level of trust required that this company handles security as it claims.
The last issue, is the fact that this wallet doesn't seem to be open source, as another Redditor pointed out.

Chain uses the Bitcoin block chain, with side chains to build platforms for financial companies that wish to take advantage of block chain technology.

Their Founder has written an extensive blog post 3
months ago on this subject—pouring water on that hypothesis:
@_date: 2015-09-12 03:37:40
There has been some  misunderstanding by some members that chain doesn't use Bitcoin block chain. I understand this to be untrue—the founder himself has explicitly stated that Chain uses the Bitcoin block chain and side chains.
I have posted an answer to this question that I suggest everyone in this thread read:
PS: Aside from the fact that I've used their API in the past, I have no affiliation to Chain. I think their a great company, and just wanted to clear up any misunderstanding.

The homepage specifically mentions using the Bitcoin blockchain for interoperability:

Currently on their website:
"Our solutions are based on the open bitcoin protocol to ensure interoperability across systems and networks."

I'm surprised Sweden actually wanted to apply VAT to Bitcoin trades. I thought they were more liberal and forward thinking on these issues.

My point is, the author of the article seems to be confounding Bitcoin usage with Bitcoin market cap.
If someone buys Bitcoin and immediately sells it for another currency, how does this affect market cap? The result is consistent—regardless of how much they buy then sell.
See: [Correlation does not imply causation](
PS: I think you meant "It's," not "its."
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:32:55
Of course. My point was that even if banks wanted to hold Bitcoin now, they can't.
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:42:31
Even if this hypothesis were true, it only speaks to volume, not market cap. If Chinese are attempting to bypass capital controls using Bitcoin, then isn't Bitcoin most likely just the proxy to obtaining another currency?
@_date: 2015-10-23 20:24:27
I agree with what you say, but why do you think the EU would rule against applying VAT to Bitcoin—considering your argument, and it potentially compromising the Euro?

I'm glad that Tor development on iOS is gaining traction, but isn't using Bitcoin over Tor a bad idea?
