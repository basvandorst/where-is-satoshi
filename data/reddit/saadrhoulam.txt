[Alan Reiner, Armory](
[Sean Neville, Circle](
[Sean Neville Q&amp;A (funny)](
[Marco Santori, the Bitcoin lawyer](
[Alec H. Petro, financial asset manager](
[James D'Angelo, World Bitcoin Network](
[Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Core](
[Andy Ofiesh, Armory](
[Ryan X. Charles, BitPay](
[Zack Ferland, Student](
That's it!
I recommend Alan Reiner for an intro, Marco Santori for any questions you have about running an exchange, and Gavin for the state of the Bitcoin Core project.
If you're less technical, see Alan Reiner, Alec H. Petro for a financier's look at Bitcoin, and James D'Angelo for how revolutionary this technology is.
Finally, the technical portion: Andy Ofiesh introduces us to Bitcoin transaction scripting, Ryan X. Charles shows us how he and a team of developers implemented a P2P Bitcoin multisig wallet using JS and Node, and Zack Ferland goes into the time-saving effect of using Bitcoin libraries and APIs rather than rolling your own.

I like to only compare things when there's a well-defined ordering relation over them. Maybe I'm just a prude.

That was a math joke.

Thanks, mate.

That was my reasoning. I took "community member" as "Bitcoin community member."

You make a compelling point. According to the [EFF FAQ]( compelled *false* speech is without legal precedent.

And the Heisenberg goatee. God damn!

Good to know. I was concerned I'd have to wait for a shipment from AUS.
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:12:53


Can I get that in different words?
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:39:18
Can you say more? Very curious.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:36:49
Nope. I'm a brother ;)

Good catch. I don't know how that 'r' snuck in twice.

From me with great affection.

Yes, it's a video of the whole expo.

Not if they've already destroyed the signing key.

Does your product ship from Australia?
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:29:54
Hook some brothers up, lead a team.

I know what I'm doing this weekend.

I was working on something similar to this, "cool storage" in a bootable USB disk with networking disabled. I abandoned it after the news about BadUSB.

Thanks!
