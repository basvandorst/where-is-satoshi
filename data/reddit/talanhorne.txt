They fed me the same tripe.
I told them I would be cancelling soon. This kind of behavior is simply unacceptable. Capital One has let people defraud me before (though they have always cancelled the charges), but in all those cases *I* was the one who discovered the fraudulent charges. They were always late to the game.
Yet they have tried to stop me from making legitimate purchases dozens of times, and now that they have blanket-banned anything crypto related, I am done with them.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:12:40
Funny, then, that Capital One didn’t stop the guy who used a gas station scanner to copy my credentials. He bought $600 of gift cards at Wal-mart (as rapid consecutive purchases of $80 or less) and Capital One didn’t so much as flag *those* transactions. I had to discover them myself.
Yet they outright prevent me from buying cryptocurrencies.
I’m done with that nonsense. I didn’t sign up for a nanny service.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:29:44
Don't forget credit card companies. Capital One now has a blanket ban against all companies that are crypto-related.

And yet those same banks and card companies don't block purchases at Wal-mart, even after someone buys $600 worth of gift cards there using stolen credit card credentials.
Funny way of doing business, wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:19:37
Oh won’t someone think of the poor credit card companies?
These are businesses so bloated with money that they could swim in it, Scrooge-McDuck-style. And they make that money by charging exorbitant, even *predatory*, interest rates that catch the foolish and desperate off guard, often ruining their lives.
I wouldn’t say I’m spending *their* money on crypto, since I am obligated *by law* to pay that money back. 
Capital One deserves no sympathy.

Online exchanges are a bit tricky.
In a private wallet, you are in control of the wallet and possess all the private keys.
On an exchange like Coinbase, your coins are in *Coinbase's* wallet, which they alone control. They keep track of who owns which coins inside their wallet, but they could, theoretically, seize or freeze any coins that are inside their own wallet.
For large amounts of Bitcoin, it is better to store them on a personal wallet, outside the control of the exchanges.
So after you have bought your coins on Coinbase, it is usually wise to send them to your own personal private wallet.

Keeping your coins on an exchange means that the exchange *controls* the coins, not that they *own* them.
Still, it's safer if you control the coins yourself in a private wallet.

*You're* really missing the point of the entire cryptocurrency space if you believe that.
We *are* talking about a tide. Or, if you prefer, you may think of it as a data tree, with Bitcoin acting as the root node. Not all altcoins are branches of Bitcoin's blockchain, but all altcoins *are* branches of Bitcoin's essential idea. 
If you succeed in chopping off the root, the rest of the tree dies.

As someone who both buys Bitcoin directly AND buys cloud mining contracts, I can safely say that not all cloud mining is a scam.
Now, it's true that, until recently, buying directly has been more profitable, just due to price increases. However, even at its worst, cloud mining was still profitable to me as long as I followed one simple rule:
Do not reinvest your cloud mining earnings in cloud mining contracts.
With the cloud mining company I use, I found that, as long as I keep that rule, I make my money back in 100 days (that has shortened to 20 days now, with the rising prices).
And as it has become too expensive to directly buy even fractions of a coin now (in some cases), cloud mining has quickly rekindled my interest, as it is now the only way to keep fueling my Bitcoin addiction.

3. Separate your new string of digits into a series of 9x9 sudoku puzzles.
4. Solve the sudoku puzzles.
5. Make a hash of each sudoku puzzle and put each hash into the header of the next puzzle (thus creating a blockchain).
6. Use a bitcoin block explorer to extract data from the blocks.

If you honestly believe your position, then take the deal. If, however, you are all bluster and no substance, then you will make excuses. You will try to weasel out, or say that you never meant *crash* crash.
The offer is on the table. If you're man enough to take it, let me know.
But in either case, you have been quite the entertaining troll.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:05:33
Some artists would do that. There are some who are so eccentric or desperate for attention that they'll try anything.
That said, I understand your point. Development on Bitcoin is going well, and a lot of improvements are coming down the pipe: Schnorr signatures, confidential transactions, and others.
Compared to those, the 2X hardfork seemed like a crude and clunky solution, bound to do more harm than good.
From an engineer's standpoint, it was a solution worse than the problem. And when put to the test (yesterday) it failed miserably.

The article says that the Bitcoin price should be $100.
That's still more than 1000x the coin's original price. To be honest, going from $0 to $100 was Bitcoin's real proving ground. Going from $1000 to $100000 is the easy part.
Even if Bitcoin were to crash by 90%, it would still be worth much more than $100. Some people are just technophobes.

I will gladly take your offer.
But you do realize that by making this counter-offer, you contradict your earlier position. If you're willing to acknowledge that Bitcoin is worth $13,600, then your idea that it will crash is ultimately wrong.
And since the Bitcoin price has risen since your first assertion, it would appear that you're being disproven anyway.
So start by telling me how much Bitcoin you have. Then I shall make arrangements for us to meet up IRL, and then we shall deal.
Or you can admit that you were just a troll this entire time, and I'll just block you.

I believe the following semantic fix resolves the issue:
You can \*own\* a bitcoin.
You cannot \*possess\* a bitcoin.
What you \*possess\* is merely the means of moving a Bitcoin from one address to another. Because the coins themselves exist only as ledger entries, and that ledger is possessed by everyone, the coins are not your possessions, but they \*are\* your property. 
It is still immoral for someone to forcibly steal or coerce coins from you (as this violates your ownership). But it is not immoral for someone to possess a copy of the ledger in which your coins are contained (as the right of possessorship is shared by all).

To be a pyramid scheme, Bitcoin would have to be an organization, rather than a currency, as pyramid schemes' central idea is that the individual makes a profit proportionate to how many others they recruit into the organization.
To be a ponzi scheme, Bitcoin would have to be a fund where new money from fresh buyers is disguised, through creative accounting, as profit for the older buyers.
Bitcoin is neither of these. The Bitcoin ecosystem provides a new technology (the blockchain) that solves a legitimate problem (mutable ledgers, trust and accountability).
But this is very difficult to explain to people who do not have a background in mathematics, software engineering, and/or cryptography. Apart from actually teaching your friends high-level concepts from these subjects, there is not much you can do, using pure rationality, to persuade them.

There's one sure way to stop them:
Every time a whale sells, everyone else buys. When the whale tries to buy back their coins, they end up with fewer that what they started with.
Once this happens enough times, the whale is no longer a whale.
And it's already happening, naturally. As more and more of the little guys start buying and hodling, the whales lose more and more of their influence.

Don't tell me you take the word of Bitcoin.com.
It is, however, only natural to believe that someone else is constantly cheating the system. But in reality, doing the kind of dump-and-pump scam that the whales supposedly get away with every time is actually really, really hard and prone to all kinds of errors.
I can guarantee that during those times when a whale actually dumps, they wrestle with a ton of risk and often lose the battle. There is no foolproof recipe for making money through such schemes.
Furthermore, a lot of price plunges are not caused by whales at all, but by the stop-loss algorithms of traders. A lot of those people follow the same technical analysis, and so when any movement happens it causes a domino effect.
So don't let Roger Ver's FUD news site get you down. Bitcoin is not controlled by some shadowy cabal of uber-whales. It's just a technology that can't be controlled, and uncontrollable things are bound to make big movements at times that are not always convenient.

Bcash was created through a hard fork, meaning that Bcash is not backwards compatible with the chain that existed before.
And as it was a particularly contentious hardfork, which alienated much of the community, it has distanced itself from everything that came before.
Meanwhile, on the original Bitcoin blockchain, SegWit was implemented through a soft fork, which was completely backwards compatible with all that came before.
Hard forks are sometimes necessary, but when a hard fork happens, it's important that the community supports it with near-unanimity. Otherwise, it has the potential to undermine the very idea of Bitcoin.
That the Bcash crowd have neither obtained nor sought unanimity of the community reveals them for what they are.

But there's just one problem: Bitcoin has already been used for ransoms and other illegal activity (though dollars are still the currency of choice for criminals), and the US government has done squat to stop Bitcoin, because it is powerless to do so.
As an international monetary system, Bitcoin lies outside the US government's jurisdiction. The government cannot stop it.

But this won't be a problem unless both chains are equally received by the community. *That* could result in a halving of the price of Bitcoin. But the likely result is that one chain will be well received and the other will be scorned, withering away like a rotten vine.

Yes. You can transfer Bitcoin simply by giving/receiving private keys containing a certain amount of coins.
However, since the giver would now have access to the same private key as the receiver, it is recommended that the receiver, upon receiving, transfer (or "sweep") the received coins into a new address as soon as possible.
But email is not secure, so you probably don't want to be sending private keys through it.

The thing to keep in mind is the F-word: Fraud.
By branding itself "Bitcoin Cash" and having its evangelists call it "the one true Bitcoin", the Bcash crowd fraudulently gets people to try trading Bcash as actual Bitcoin.
This leads to a lot of unfortunate scenarios where people think they're starting to get invested in Bitcoin, thinking they've found a sweet deal on some strangely discounted coins, when what they're actually buying is Bcash.
It also causes problems when newcomers try to send Bitcoin to a Bcash address, and lose all their coins.
Inasmuch as the Bcash people use the Bitcoin name under false pretenses, they are trying to defraud the community.
That's why there is so much hate against them. Plain and simple.
