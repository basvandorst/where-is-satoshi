I don't understand this internet. You get chatting to a stranger who has a pyromaniac feminist girlfriend with an aversion to mollusc sex - and you are sad because I didn't knock out a decent bra factory story? Oh internet.

She is super fit and totally real. This is how all internet stories about gf's start, amiright?
Anyway she was out in Bangledesh about a year ago, was grabbing a cheeky smoke and this garment factory went up.

Fair point, when I say stabilize I don't mean, its value compared to fiat is flatter than flat. I mean that it is not as easily manipulated as the first commenter puts it.
I'm aware that no currency is fixed, the first thing I do before heading out to the US is look at the GBP/US exchange rate.
I just wanted to put down some thoughts down on finding a way to fix its value to some goods hence the 0.001 = 1 x mp3 on Play.
In the UK for £1 I would expect to be able to buy one of the following:
A Bag of fries/chips
A bottle of Coke
So in the bitcoin equivalent when I hold that 0.001BTC in my wallet I expect to be able to buy:
An mp3
An Android App
