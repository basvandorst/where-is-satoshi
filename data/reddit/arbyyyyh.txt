Real talk, I bought 1/2 a coin back when it was about $300 USD, then my money got locked from losing 2FA and I watched my BTC soar up to 12k and now we're back down to 3k... this has been a terrible roller coaster that I can't get off of even if I wanted to... now I have to wait a year until I can opt off the coaster... which could be a blessing in disguise.

So let me get this straight... In order for a market to be tradeable, you need to be identifiable? So if I, an anonymous redditor, somehow got everyone to believe that the US dollar was going to crash tomorrow and they all should turn their savings into BTC... Wouldn't that kind of break that logic?

Having someone connecting to WiFi that someone managed to spring up is much easier than getting a server located somewhere in a datacenter connected to the internet when the typical means of connection to the internet is down (as well as its' backups). That's great that Visa has robust infrastructure, but if you can't get out to the internet to connect to that infrastructure, it doesn't do a whole lot of good. All you really need to be able to do is reach one single host on the internet that is connected to the BTC network and you can make transactions (more or less).

When I was in high school I would stop at Dunkin with a friend of mine and send him money on PayPal for $3-4. Eventually for some reason my dad saw my bank statement and somehow deduced that this meant I was doing drugs... still not sure on that one.
Edit for clarity because my mind was not when I wrote this lol

I live in close proximity to NYC so whenever I've bought BTC I go to a BTM. They don't care what I do with my BTC.

A few years back when I first bought some BTC this was like then only place that I could find that had a BTM... I was obviously visibly confused because someone in the shop had told me that I found the right place and pointed me to the machine. Sort of place that I would never have stepped foot in otherwise, but I sort of appreciated that fact about it.
