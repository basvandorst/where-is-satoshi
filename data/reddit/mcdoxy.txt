I'm quite torn on this subject.
To be honest, a part of me also believes that bitcoin will be worth 5 or 6 figures some day if it really starts to become mainstream (that might take a decade though). 
But another part of me thinks: If something sounds to good to be true, it's usually not and bitcoin might not be adopted by the masses as a lot of people here anticipate. Also governments have a far bigger power over the adoption of bitcoin than most people on here care to admit.
Time will tell

People value bitcoin because it has practical use as a payment system and it is better than anything we have.
(Besides all the other awesome stuff you can do with bitcoin)
that alone gives bitcoin value.

The guys at Nxt are actually looking for someone who can explain a successful nothing-at-stake attack to them. They say that nothing-at-stake is a myth and wouldn't work, at least not with the Nxt algorithm.
Maybe head over there and join the conversation?
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:00:44
Nxt doesn't have a NaS vulnerability.
Even Vitalik Buterik realized that, why do you think he used a similar algorithm for Ethereum?
Some PoS coins might have a NaS vulnerability, but Nxt and Ethereum are definitely not one of them.

What about debit cards?
Paypal hooked up to your bank account?
direct debit payments?
I mean sure, bitcoin is way better than any of those options. But there are certainly more options you can choose from when you don't have a credit card.
But I live in Germany where credit cards aren't used as much like they are in the US. Don't know if some of those are available to you.
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:56:45
Yup it is "premined", because it is 100% Proof of Stake.
But not sure what you mean by centralized. It's just as decentralized as bitcoin or any other coin.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:18:52
Cool project!
I looked at the the trustless exchange example on their website where Bob has $1000 and wants to buy 1BTC from Sarah.
But I still don't get how the dollars are being transfered to Sarah. Through bank wiring? Paypal? A centralized entity? The peer to peer network? If yes then how are you supposed to deposit and withdraw dollars from the network?
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:39:46
If we are talking about Bitcoin the currency, I agree. If we are talking about bitcoin the protocol and the blockchain and the invention, I disagree.
You can completely decentralize almost every application that exists on the internet and solve the trust issue.
Decentralized social networks, decentralized data storage, even decenatralized internet.
And the amazing part? Those things I mentioned are already being worked on and some are already released.
It's basically a way to reorganize ourselves in a more efficient and better way for everybody.

I think you should look again.
The growth of the bitcoin ecosystem is pretty huge if you ask me!
Hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested in bitcoin startups just *this* year alone! More and more big companies are starting to accept it.
And you can't expect such a technology like bitcoin to become mainstream within 5 years because it's not your usual technology. Something disruptive like this comes along just every few decades and there has to be alot of infrastructure built around bitcoin to make it appealing for the average person. The internet didn't become what it is today after 5 years either.

I agree that there are a lot of crypto currencies with more advanced features, but every altcoin community thinks they will surpass bitcoin at some point and to think that is just delusional and underestimates the power of network effects. 
I haven't seen any crypto currency that even comes close to bitcoin's network effects, which are several orders of magnitudes bigger. 
A lot of altcoin fanboys just don't want to see that.
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:28:41
Besides money/finance?
Well theoretically you can decentralize almost everything with the blockchain technology.
Cloud storage, voting and politics, corporations, the internet itself (maidsafe project)...
I probably forgot alot of stuff too.

Exactly... isn't fiat currency by definition not backed by anything other than the trust in the government? That's why it's called fiat (latin for 'let it be so')
If you could actually redeem anything it would be called commodity money.

Well... most of my friends are pretty receptive about it, although they would never buy bitcoin themselves and I would never push it on them.
I know one guy who reacted the same way as you described.
But I don't really care, because they will all come around eventually in a few years.
But I recently noticed when I walk through the streets and I see all those people just living their daily lifes, I start thinking "Holy shit those people have no fucking idea what kind of revolution is about to hit them..."
@_date: 2014-01-26 11:28:17
Well 20k of 200k are like 10% of your families savings. I would definitely put that into Bitcoin.
2014 will be a pretty big year for Bitcoin with mainstream adoption starting to happen and Wall Street money moving in. So it would be only wise to put a portion into Bitcoin.
I actually have almost all my money in Bitcoin and only a small portion in a bank because I don't trust banks or the government.

Well news outlets are unfortunately just businesses trying to make money. So writing about a new technology that was used to buy illegal drugs on the internet makes for a better headline and leads to more clicks and therefore more revenue.
Sadly that's the world we live in. I stopped trusting the media a long time ago.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:38:46
In theory you are correct about being able to upgrade software easier and cheaper. But with any protocol it becomes harder and harder over time to do updates and at some point development comes to a halt, because the more people a protocol use and build into their product, the harder it is make changes everybody will accept.
We are already seeing this with bitcoin where the devs have to be extremely careful what they change and what not, because if they fuck it up they risk flushing billions of dollars down the drain. And this trend will continue. We might have only a few years left where actual changes can be made to the bitcoin protocol before development stops.
@_date: 2014-05-28 08:11:56
All those points he made are going to be eliminated in a couple of years. Either he is someone who really doesn't understand how technology development works or someone who desperately tries to find arguments to discredit bitcoin because he doesn't want it to succeed.
I guess he is the latter.

I agree that some posts are obviously there just to collect some tips. And I don't have a problem with it if people call them out.
But what bugs me is when new users come here and are genuinely excited about bitcoin, post something and get beaten down by people in this subreddit because they think they just want to collect some tips.
There is a fine line, and I just feel like that line was crossed way too often recently. If you're not exactly sure, just give people the benefit of the doubt.

There will always be middlemen that handle transactions for the average joe.
Of course it would be ideal if everyone would have their own cold storage wallet and send bitcoins to each other, but the real world doesn't work like that. Most people choose convinience over security or idealism.
And in fact I think those middlemen are an important piece to make bitcoin appealing to the general public and increade adoption.
But the beautiful thing about bitcoin is ... you can always choose.

This isn't such a big threat as everybody thinks. If GHas.io would decide to do such an attack they would ruin their business and Bitcoin would react and shut them out the next day. Andreas Antonopoulos already talked about this:

We are still faaaar away from being able to pay with bitcoin through paypal. I would say at least a year or two.
Braintree supporting bitcoin brings nothing new to merchant acceptance. It's basically what we already had with Bitpay. But now paypal integration definitely seems more certian in the future.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:32:52
Those 30k bitcoins didn't either ...
With your logic that the supply increases because those bitcoins are being auctioned now you can just as easily argue that the demand increases because there are alot of buyers who want those coins. It's a zero sum argument.
For every sell there is also a buy. This doesn't have any direct effect on the price other than publishing the sell price later on and letting market psychology come into play.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:10:27

@_date: 2014-07-03 14:37:43
If you're living in the US you might consider something like the new vault option at coinbase?
Otherwise maybe just buy bitcoins, load them on to a paper wallet and put them in safety deposit box at a bank. That way you don't have direct access to them and would first have to get them from the bank. That way you could resist the urge to trade/spend them.

Dish was the only big news ... Apple and Amazon are of minor importance, because it's not like the started accepting bitcoin as a payment and using it for their company. 
Apple just allowed bitcoin apps back on their store (which broadens the market potential, yes, but it's far from getting a bunch of apple users or apple itself on board)
And Amazon patents shit all the time, doesn't mean they will do it, but they are giving themselves options.
So the only company which really brings monetary value to the network is Dish. How you can get to such a prediction of $10k+ is beyond me. Not to mention that this would mean an over 20x increase even though the last bubbles were just a 10x increase max.
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:58:12
I'm seriously reluctant to give you a nice answer if you begin by writing such a hostile and arrogant post, which shows me that you definitely don't know much about bitcoin.
First of all, there are just so many things the core developers can work on, and they are already occupied with far more important tasks.
Secondly, nobody is saying that bitcoin already has all those things, but everyone knows that they are perfectly possible, but it takes time to build the infrastructure for all of this.
Thirdly, there are already alt coins which are working on this as we speak. The first that come to mind are mastercoin, colored coin and nxt (which already has a working asset exchange with stocks, distributed autonomous corporations and assets)
@_date: 2014-11-18 11:05:19

Nope. Definitely wouldn't be the first-ever on a "on a cryptosecurities platform".

But would be the first big and publicy known company to do that, that's true.

First of all, it doesn't say that they will develop a blockchain based platform.
But if the banks roll out their own crypto it will definitely not kill bitcoin.
Even if they manage to get everyone in the developed countries to use that system, what about the billions of people who can't get a bank account or are operating on the black market?
Plus a system that will enable instant transactions is pretty cute, but probably one of the smallest features bitcoin will offer in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-15 13:05:33
But isn't the value of the protocol connected with the value of the currency?
I think both go hand in hand and it doesn't make much sense to just analyze the currency through traditional models, because bitcoin is not a traditional currency. If it just were a currency most of us wouldn't be here and the value wouldn't be nearly as high as it is today.
So by making "it doesn't serve any other purpose but as 'money'" a prerequisite for his calculations, they instantly become invalid for me.

But that suff is not suited for someone who just started out. If you do that and you don't know what the hell you are doing you will lose money, that I can guarantee you!
So my advice to you is this: Don't do it.
I'm not sure if there is a service where you get interest on your bitcoins. But if you find one, be EXTREMELY carfeul! There are alot of scams out there!

The best and easiest explanation I've heard so far is:
Think of bitcoin like a big excel file where the balance from every person is stored. When you make a transaction you basically put the bitcoins from one balance to the balance it was sent to.
Now imagine that excel file is distributed all around the world through peer to peer on every computer that joins the network. This ensures that nobody can cheat, because your tampered excel file would conflict all the other excel files in the network.

I wouldn't say they were secretive about it. The developers actually always answered every question as good as they could and the code has been open source since January I think.

Plus, someone wrote that their algorithm is much more related to delegated pos than TaPoS

Here are probably the best ways to increase your bitcoin position:
* Start a business to service the community and sell something for bitcoin
* Trading
* Invest in alt coins in early stages
* Buy more with your own money

This could be very cool for developers calling API's that provide valuable data or services. But I'm not sure about average users viewing content like news articles or blog posts.
First of all there would have to be some kind of check in place if I really want to pay to read that article, because otherwise it will result in hidden fees for viewing a webpage, which would suck. So the paywalls he showed won't go away. The only thing which changes is that those paywalls will be everywhere and it's easier to pay. But running into paywalls all the time would make me furious as a user. I doubt it would be a pleasent experience while surfing, but maybe I'm missing something.

Interesting. That's a very specific niche of websites. Everywhere else retail adoption went down because noone wants to spend it or price is too volatile.
As for buying bitcoins, seems like you're trying to buy bitcoins through pretty shitty services. 30% fee is nuts. Go find reputable exchanges that are available in your area. Have you tried coinbase, bitstamp or kraken? There you deposit money by making a bank transfer. Not sure if you can deposit money with debit or credit card on those. Probably not.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:39:51


From the article: 
"We’re self-mining with just a small portion of our available power, with the rest allocated to customers, and we have plans to make the hosting service available to smaller miners that otherwise would not be able to mine effectively."
So they are themselves only using a small portion of the hash power and like you said I don't think they give a shit about btrash.
They are not malicious actors like Roger Ver, CJW or Calvin Ayre.
@_date: 2019-08-03 10:00:07
That is true and I believe more and more high net worth individuals and institutions will invest over time which will make the market more efficient. But I don't think we are there yet. Almost, but not quite. In my opinion price is still largely retail driven. Until the institutional on-ramps, which are being developed right now, aren't fully launched I wouldn't assume that the halving is being priced in. If those on-ramps are being launched before the halving, that would be a different story. Then I could imagine a front-running from institutional players. But even then I could also imagine a pretty big institutional FOMO once those new gateways are open.

Bitstamp is one of the oldest and most reputable exchanges and always did their best to be compliant.
I doubt they are doing it to fuck with you and I doubt contacting your EU represantitive helps.
It's not unusual to ask for further documents to comply with AML.
I had to go through that as well. It was for more than 1000 EUR though. But I also had to wait several weeks before my money was in my account. Maybe the amount you withdrew in total up until now is that significant that they need to do AML. It's not unusual and they are definitely not trying to scam you.
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:33:44
Bitcoin is veeery far from being a mature and efficient market. The impact of the halving isn't understood by the majority of people. I think it would be a mistake to assume that it is already priced in. As far as I remember people assumed the same thing in 2016 and then the price grew 40x.

Sure all this pumping is fun and exciting. But if the price grows so much in such a short period of time and goes exponential, making it unsustainable, we set ourselves up for some tough months ahead. That's why you should be very concerned about what happened over the last few weeks instead of a slow growth with healthy pullbacks.
All of you should have learned this by now.
Except the newcomers of course. They're in for a lesson.

Misleading headline. There's no indication that this is actually a whale withdrawing money from the exchange.
No one keeps that much on an exchange and withdraws to an address without a test transaction first.
It's most probably just the exchange itself moving some funds around into a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:52:21
First of all, Bitcoin isn't accepted enough in the mainstream and hasn't transformed our economies yet. So that someone will be nominated for a nobel prize is still waaaay off.
Secondly, while I love the talks of Andreas, I don't see how that makes him eligible for such a prize.
Thirdly, the person or persons who should get a nobel prize before anyone else is/are Satoshi Nakomoto (even if she/he/they vanished)
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:59:26
No. It might transform the banking sector and banks will have to adjust. But they will always be there.

That's now how the evolution to a sound money works. It first has to become a store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:51:19
Yup that's true. Like I said 'at least not systemically'. That would be deflation which is not built into the system. Not sure if that is even predictable.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:21:08
I agree that it's not really being used for payments yet or as a medium of exchange.
The thing what most people don't get is that it's not ready for that yet. And it doesn't have to be. It's a new emerging asset class and until it matures and prices stabilize it probably won't be used much for payments, because why would I spend my bitcoin if I'm convinced that it will be worth much more in the future.
Until then its main use is store of value. And so far it's doing that exceptionally well.
The monetary revolution takes a lot longer than people realize.

@_date: 2019-12-05 12:00:19
Not sure what's so wrong about that.
While it might be senseless from a technical standpoint, psychologically people very much tend to start sending small amounts to an address to confirm they didn't make any mistakes before transacting big amounts. Especially since transactions are not reversible. And that is good practice imho. You never know if you could have malware on your computer which replaces the address in your browser.
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:38:54
For me, every day is proof of keys day.
If you leave bitcoin on an exchange, shame on you! SHAME!
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:38:17
It doesn't show maturity at all.
Those are not signs of an healthy and orderly market.
You need significant pullbacks to establish a solid base. All it shows is that speculation is back in full force.
Everyone should be concerned that we've gone up 20 consecutive weeks without significant pullbacks.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:14:13


Bitcoin's inflation rate will never fall below 0%. At least not systemically. It's always above 0% and is being halved ever 4 years. So it trends to 0% and finally reaching 0% by 2140. So technically it's inflationary until 2140.

The fact that you can only find information about this on some whacky conspiracy websites raises big red flags for me.

Right, so what is your advantage over the open source p2p exchange protocols that are developed for bitcoin? (colored coins/mastercoins for example)
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:06:16
Well I clicked on withdraw, chose bitcoins as withdraw method, pasted in my wallet address, clicked on the checkbox that said add transaction fee, clicked ok, and the it said your account is pending and being reviewed or something like that.
I read that that can happen when you use tor but I didn't. So I don't know why it happened but I'm now waiting to get verified.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:18:00
You're forgetting that it's not only a currency and a store of value. It is a protocol like TCP/IP is for the internet. It is the fastest, cheapest and best payment processing system in the world. In 1-2 years new protocols ON TOP of the bitcoin blockchain will be deployed where you have p2p exchanges where you can trade anything and issue your own stocks, bonds whatever you want. It will revolutionize the financial market because it gives people the power to manage their own money without the need for any banks or financial institutions.
If you believe bitcoin is just some virtual currency you clearly don't undestand bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:30:40
Again, the intrinsic value lies in the network ... bitcoin is not just a currency or commodity. It is the first payment processing system in the world that allows to completely put banks and financial institutions out of the equation. What the internet was for communication, bitcoin is for money. And bitcoin doesn't stop there. It's like a protocol like TCP/IP is and soon second layer protocols are to be released where you have decentralized p2p exchanges where you can trade anything and issue your own stocks without any financial institution.

Didn't actually get verified yet since you don't need to be verified to start trading.
But haven't had any problems so far and they are very reliable. During crashes or rallies the site can be a bit slow or sometimes even offline but that's about it and not a big deal.

Didn't even know why I had to do it in order to withdraw my bitcoins. 
I just hope it doesn't take too long.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:25:48
Nope they are like second layer protocols which work on top of the bitcoin protocol. There most known p2p exchanges currently in development are colored coins and mastercoin.
And you can see one of the bitcoin developers talk about the concept here: 
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:45:52
oh I see... you didn't send it to your own wallet on your compuert but to your wallet on blockchain.com.
Well that's normal that it takes a bit to show up because it's waiting for 6 confirmations through the network and 1 confirmation usually takes 5-10 minutes. if you would have a client on your pc you could see how many confirmations you  have under "transactions" but blockchain doesn't have something like that.

Might be an option, but that would still be bitcoin related and could fail (venture capital is also a pretty high risk). Look into some traditional investment (stocks, bonds, hedge funds etc.)
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:24:44

@_date: 2013-11-25 08:42:45
Well I would say wait a little more. It's usually not instantaneous and maybe it has to wait for verifications (but usually that should show up on your client, look under transactions).
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:00:41

I agree with you that the entry barrier is really high. But that will definitely change in the future. And right now I wouldn't even open a new exchange as a company because once the new p2p exchange protocols for bitcoin are released (colored coins for example) there will be completely different possibilities of what you can do.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:59:25
Also distributed p2p exchanges will deploy in the next 1-2 years. So this problem will be solved.

Personally I think Max Keiser acts out of self interest most of the time and to get attention.

begging for bitcoins ... seriously ... that's just pathetic
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:49:42
I totally agree. In order to get a widespread adoption from the general population everything has to be safer, simplified and usuable with a click of a button.
I think in the future there will be some kind of bitcoin bank or maybe even normal banks will fill out that space. Maybe they will begin to store all the bitcoins offline in vaults since every computer system can be breached somehow.
I also agree about the wallet addresses. I think there has to be solution for the situation where person A wants to send person B some bitcoins, and can do so by the push of a simple button or information they can exchange over the phone without giving up anything about the encryption security.

Exactly, people are always talking about that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but they don't see that bitcoin isn't just a currency. It is also an asset to invest in and the first micro payment processing system without having to have any intermediaries. 3 things wrapped up in one brilliantly designed and utterly genius protocol. Most people don't see it yet but I'm sure that this technology will truly change the financial industry.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:30:31

Exactly, bitcoin hasn't even begun to reach its full potential. As soon as the second layer protocols come out (colored coins/mastercoin) THEN it's gonna get really fucking interesting! As soon as everybody can trade everything with each other and create their own bonds/stocks whatever and gives access to financial markets to everyone... THIS will be a fucking game changer!

You have to understand that Bitcoin goes far beyond a currency, commodity and payment system (best, cheapest and fastest in the world btw). Not only does it put banks and 3rd parties completely out of the picture. It is a protocol like TCP or HTTP where new things can be build on top of it. In the next few years we will see decentralized p2p exchanges where you can trade anything and even issue your own stocks and bonds, we will see the blockchain be turned into a prive ledger for contracts and asset ownership, we will see a completely new financial market. And there are things we can't even think about yet just like when we first started to use the internet.

Bitcoin already has something like kickstarter build into the protocol. Nobody uses it though. It's basically something like an insurance contract and you can watch one of the bitcoin developers talk about it here:

First of all, bitcoin doesn't care at all what happens in the united states. Currently only 2% of bitcoin transactions come from us jurisdiction.
Secondly, banks aren't really worried about bitcoin yet because it's trading volume is relatively small in comparison to everything else out there in the market.
Thirdly, I think government institutions haven't even understood bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:35:03
yup but they probably won't be as valuable as bitcoin because of the network effect 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:05:18

There several wallets available that you can download for your computer. You can get the original BitcoinQt wallet or a lightweight wallet like Electrum.
Well in order to receive payments to your wallet you have to be connected to the network.
You can also print yourself a paper wallet in order to store your bitcoins offline which is probably the safest method to store your bitcoins. Go to

Even if something like this would exist ... power corrupts, even the one with the best intentions. That is why it must stay a completely decentralized system. Besides, they wouldn't have the power to change the distribution of bitcoins. They can't just take property or money from another person.

I don't think you can check that on blockchain.com. You just have to wait until the transaction has 6 confirmations and clears. Then it will show up. If it doesn't show up within 1-2 hours I would say there is a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:58:39
Well ... first of all don't tell anybody that you're wealthy. People behave different around you if they know you're rich. If it's already too late for that and you want to meet a nice girl, just go somewhere where nobody knows you and try to meet a girl.
And most importantly: stay modest! Don't go off throwing your money where ever you go buying cars, houses, watches etc. Treat yourself a little but don't change your lifestyle that much.
Also: if you're already filthy rich from bitcoin it might be a good idea to diversify your portfolio and invest your money in some other stuff because bitcoin might still fail leaving you with nothing.
