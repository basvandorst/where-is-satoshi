They tweeted a bit ago. 
"Thanks everyone! Our first experiment was a success! We'll relaunch a genesis block in two weeks. Stay tuned!"

It is awesome to be casually browsing reddit and see an event some of us are working on mentioned. Thanks! Should be a lot of fun and be a good educational event for the general public.

This video is what worked for a local business for me.  I had written to him to ask him to accept bitcoin. A few weeks later he found the video on his own.  He then wrote back saying he wanted to meet. Now he is working on implementation.  The key for the video is that it assumes you know what bitcoin is in basics. And it goes directly towards some of the bad actors/news, huge growth and the VC investors perspective on why they think it is worth investing in.

I found this tweet  with some details and the image.

The point isn't making money. It is broadly contributing in mass to balance.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:35:47
Cheers for that.  Between this and the r/millionairemakers/ I finally set up my changetip account. :-)  Let the fun tonight begin! (in 24 minutes)

I am talking about very inexpensive stuff.  Not throwing money away. Chips for dollars or less.  Nobody is losing out big. I have idle machines. Many. PC's notebooks, smartphones, smart TV's, hell even the smart damn fridge. Why shouldn't they contribute? Each machine would do very little over all, but people in mass doing it would distribute the mining outside of the well funded. Hell even the USB block eruptor was damn cheap for what it was.  In mass production the tech in that could be made for fractions of price.
This isn't a competition, it is a contribution.

a chip or microusb that can be native installed in all hardware or easily plugged into smartphones, etc which quietly and efficiently mines btc.  It will never make much, but may be enough to cover fees, etc and add to the diversity of the ecosystem.  No reason that every internet connected device of mine shouldn't be an asic miner.  The block eruptors proved you could have something inexpensive, small and low power which wouldn't take resources from the machine itself.

The best commercial thus far.  More Sprinkles!

Folks have been submitting some suggestions. One thing to consider if you take them and opt to make a new chart: add decimal spaces. Just easier for folks to read. :-)

Well crap I just picked a horrible time to try to transfer my coins. Sigh.  I am sure it will all work out.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:29:16
Did you get them from mining?  Are they in a pool somewhere?
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:51:11
Outstanding.  A refreshing change vs the all too frequent "I won crazy BTC just now on XYZ" posts we have been seeing.  I'm gonna have to investigate this tipping thing and participate in the love fest. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:22:23
What math?
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:39:26
I ran a transfer of bitcoins this morning at coinbase and it cleared pretty quickly.  Whatever issues they had seem to be no more now.  No loss of BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:09:01
I am glad you brought this up.

I would love to hear more thoughts about this. We have had a number of discussions about the atm at the office. I can't see a scenario where anyone would want to use it in a normal situation.  By normal I mean not forcing the bitcoin into the situation.  
Take their bar example (or drug store, or restaurant).  Why would I put cash in to get bitcoin when I can just use the cash itself?  Why would the vendor pay 1.5k to enable that.  
The only answer I can come up with is that the vendor in question is speculating on the rise of bitcoin and has thus giving special offers if people pay in bitcoin, thus incenting the end user to change their cash to bitcoin first.
I am sure there are better scenarios, just haven't personally come up with them.  Outside of speculation, bitcoin doesn't seem to hold much value now.  Not until I can pay the babysitter, buy my beer, pay my mortgage, etc. with as much or more ease than using cash now.  Looking forward to any scenario/tech that helps that happen.

A friend and I have talked about it a bit as a startup idea. If we are talking I am sure others are too.  Certainly would be handy.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:21:48
Trying to. I really wish coinbase would refresh their supply...
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:02:57
All of that may be well and true, but to the point of ATM machines in a business is the question. I am not clear how your points explain the need of said ATM.
EDIT: for clarity.

My bartender has yet to accept bitcoin. Same for my mortgage company. :-)

Ask away.  There are a number of resources to read up on too there are links on the right hand side of this subreddit for FAQ, getting started, etc.  Keep in mind there are lots of different people interested in bitcoins for a variety of reasons.  Some very political, others financial, still others rather personal.  Take each personal take as what it is, one of many reasons and not the only representation of a very diverse community.
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:48:45
Would make sense.  Though in my vision it is already happening.  Nobody knows they are doing it, it is a slow secret process.  
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:15:51
Happy Cake Day. Have a tip.

An alternate for you would be a browser extension.  There are everal for Chrome out there now.
I use this one which shows the currency in the way I want, and has alerts for high and low triggers.
@_date: 2013-03-27 18:18:26
I had the same issue, turns out I mistyped my account number.  Transposed 2 digits. Once I fixed it was done in 2 days.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:26:14
Bitinstant connecting the two. On mobile so can't confirm.

Coinbase shows transaction logs. Is there anything in the log?

MtGox seems to be the place to go if you want to do a lot of big or frequent trading.  Coinbase is good for getting 10BTC at a time.  MtGox was all backed up on creating new accounts, not sure if that is cleared out yet or not.  Coinbase itself will take a few days to validate your bank account. Once you buy BTC with coinbase it will likely take a week before you get them. This is part of their fraud prevention.  Otherwise coinbase isn't a bad setup. Coinbase had some issues with pending transations during a database update, but that also seems to be resolved, at least for me.
Alternately you can look at something like bitinstant, and do a cash deposit to a specific bitcoin address.  I am not sure what % fees that incurs though.
Personally I would recommend making an account with mtGox and coinbase, so you have options down the road.  Remember it takes time to get approved and to the point of buying coins.  I learned the hard way and bought at a good $15 more than I wanted as I didn't realize it wasn't instant.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:01:14
 seems like a solid option.

I was talking about this with a friend the other day.  IF the goverment wanted to get rid of Bitcoin (or similar) they could spend hundreds of millions on legal, software, etc.  Or just buy it all up and destroy.  Poof.

Count me in that group.

I had accidentally deleted my qtc wallet on a machine with coins still in it.  Just reinstalled and presto there they were.  Maybe an option for you.

I have done business with e-Gov Link a few years ago.  Good stuff.  Great to see you pushing bitcoins for municipalities.
