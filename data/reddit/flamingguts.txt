Whaa? Really? If I burned 200 billion dollars it wouldn't affect the dollar's value? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:43:43
What do you do now?
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:59:50
Just as easy.

You owned 5000 BTC and don't know how to spell "lose"?

If that's the only argument you've seen you clearly haven't read this thread. There are some legitimate arguments here.
I'm not going to hold your hand through it, but feel free to read around.

If you mean what you wrote you just answered your own question.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:26:41
Just like the last big BTC fiasco, Silk Road!
Oh wait...
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:48:50
Exactly this. Nobody will give a shit about today 2014 in 2017. And I can promise you BTC will be well over $500 then, too.
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:30:09
Nobody is saying it needs to be made fun, or have its image lived up. 
It does need exposure, though. Advertisement is a great idea.
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:52:38
Soon better mean right now. No way in hell it stays under $600 for long.
Remember when everyone was drooling at the thought of buying BTC for UNDER $1000? Now's your chance to buy at nearly half that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:32:38
And it has been true at all of those prices. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:17:54
What is?
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:27:25
YES. Store your coins on your computer if you trust your security and plan on spending them. Otherwise paper wallets are your safest bet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:57:01
I too save some Bitcoin. Everyone should.
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:55:42
No. Stop spamming this shit.

So do it? BTC isn't going anywhere. ..
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:35:41
The people that don't understand what the word virtual means most likely won't understand the word digital either. I assume most people just think digital means "on computers or something."

I would love to hear those arguments for it being "ridiculous. "

Won't be a big deal again when it starts to climb after a few more days.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:23:27
Not even close. You see, he (his company) is part of the reason that BTC will rise. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:02:51
Don't give those idiots traffic.

I lost nothing and bought a ton of cheap coins....
Sooo... fucking awesome? 
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:54:30
Virtual has several definitions, "not real" isn't one of them.
Here's the most relevant one to Bitcoin: "occurring or existing primarily online"
Virtual and digital are both acceptable.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:24:36
The graph is silly, but the thought of the value going up forever with a limited currency is not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:02:28
Yes. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:26:46
If I see this fucking analogy one more time....
But seriously, it doesn't apply when "catching the knife" has essentially zero risk.
Do you honestly think BTC will never go above $600 again?
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:07:18
Right, I didn't say digital was incorrect. I just said virtual was not incorrect. Both are fine.
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:32:03
One could do a lot of things....
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:02:59
A few people? Millions of dollars worth of BTC flow through that site. Yes, the second one.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:11:29
Because it's only hundreds of millions now. Imagine what it could be in 10 years. He could be by far the richest man on the planet. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:08:43
I agree that this post is stupid, but it is an excellent time to buy. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:55:26
I've done nothing but gain. You're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:42:31


Nah. People that aren't into Bitcoin won't even understand what MtGox was enough to care. ATM's and a business like Neo/Bee on the other hand are something everyone can understand.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:12:22
That loss was due to people's storage choice. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:00:31
It's always a good time to buy.

@_date: 2014-02-25 19:01:05
Only stupid people lost their coins. They learned a lesson about storage. 
The vast majority of BTC users were unaffected. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:34:00
Would they do that with dollars? Because a dollar changes value as well.
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:01:06
Haha! Source please!

@_date: 2014-04-04 06:56:49
Long term? 
I would rather not use USD some day. It's a horrible, corrupt system. 
If I have the choice between shopping for groceries with USD or BTC I will choose the place that accepts BTC.

Honestly dude, if you don't have a special mining computer,  just forget about mining BTC.  You won't mine anything.
If you want to try out mining, mine an alt coin with high volume. Dogecoin is a good place to start. You can mine thousands of Doge on a regular computer.

Because BTC was made difficult to discuss like we discuss dollars. We need a widely adopted, more accurate denomination. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:10:20
That only makes me harder.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:00:34
You know why it wont crash? BECAUSE 90% OF YOU MOTHER FUCKERS ARE *BEGGING* FOR A CRASH!
Demand is high. If there's even a tiny dip it gets bought up. No way in hell there's a "crash" worth noting.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:07:46
It was still excellent publicity. My grandpa that doesn't even own a computer is curious about it now.

You must be the same guy that said this when BTC was at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. I guess we'll see you again at 900? Or will you just wait til 1000 this time?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:03:34
You realize they're sold out because an absurd amount of people are buying, right? Now they're going to have to turn to more expensive options to buy. 
It's going to fucking skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:15:35
Odd, mine says will complete on Friday Nov, 22 2013 at 12:12PM, but I still got the current price...
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:15:16
It would be labeled as "supporting terrorism" or straight up "terrorism".

What does this mean? Until BTC are worth 10,000 US dollars?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:04:15
More places accept BTC every day. Tons of non-chains already accept BTC, like my favorite mom and pop pizza shop (Westside Pizza). You can shop at Subway and Target with BTC if big chains are more your thing.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:34:57

Signed up with my Coinbase email, and downloaded the Coinbase app.
What gives?
Edit: I recieved my coins! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:38:06
No, it couldn't go to $100.
Do you know how many people are drooling over the idea of buying in at even $500 right now?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:26:02
And not having to worry about freezing to death and starving to death......
That's nice too.

Don't know why people keep suggesting this site, it's awful.
Finding someone on Craigslist is a much better bet.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:01:18
You fool. Buy. Don't listen to the idiots here like yourself that keep hoping for a crash. Demand is far too high for that to happen.

I'll give you $50 for one right now.

Ahhh, this is so sweet after having to bear all the "crash prophets" begging for a crash all month. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:52:35
I always love hearing the answer to this one. "It's used as a conductor in electronics, and some people think it's pretty...."
So that makes it worth over $1000 per oz. Alright then.

I'd be happy to buy on BitQuick if there was a single reasonable sale happening. I've been checking for days now and seen zero.
I'm not buying at &gt;$900 when BTC is at 700. That's just stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:06:47
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:32
Because there are never any reasonable offers on that site. The only ones that are even able to be purchased right now are above $1000. 
Cool idea, horrible execution. Stop spamming this sub with that awful site, please.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:29:08
Buy now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:33:07
Sub just doubled in subscribers. The majority of the front page is legitimate discussion.
Yeah, sure. Dead sub.
Why are you here?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:08:55
It's at ~600 now. It was at 500 something at the start of yesterday. 
There was a spike yesterday, not a crash.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:33:09
What will they do tomorrow, though? Give you the price for Nov 23? 
How do they end this?
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:36:59
I hope you realize that you just defined a dollar's worth as a dollar's worth.
Do you understand why that doesn't make any sense **OR** makes just as much sense as Bitcoin?

Oh god, so many "told you so's".
If there is a drop below $400 or a leveling off above $600 this sub will be virtually unreadable. 
Before the hindsight: BTC WILL HIT $1000 BEFORE THE NEW YEAR! You heard it here, folks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:54:59
From more and more countries adopting BTC, and more companies accepting BTC as a payment every day. BTC becomes more useful every day.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:25:58
Same here. I was mad that they took such a huge cut. Now after watching my money quintuple it's not so bad...
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:57:42
Doubtful. This is going to push the price up. It would be foolish to sell right before an almost guaranteed spike.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:51:41
Crash hard? You do realize it was less than $100 a month ago, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:41:04
That's a stupid idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:24:34
Most people are buying BTC at a price. It's a relevant discussion. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:27:06
Dollars being affected by inflation isn't what makes them useful...
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:58:59
It's really that simple. This should really be on the sidebar since many people still don't get it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:47:59
How to they end the backlog. It seems bizzare to start selling at current price tomorrow while people that bought today are still waiting for Friday's price.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:51:41
But those of us that placed pending recurring orders earlier can't make a new order now..... ugh.
Oh well. I got some at $569.93/BTC earlier. I still want more though.....
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:24:24
To be fair, it did go to the moon.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:22:17
I'm not the guy that posted that, I was just guessing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:21:11
If you didn't see that message it should have. They added an extra check box at the bottom of the order page to warn you that you're buying at Friday's price.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:50:59
It's usually panic sellers. You will see them again the next time BTC takes a little dip. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:16:50
Probably ~3 BTC

@_date: 2013-11-18 20:23:26
There's no way they let these transactions stand.... they would lose so much money...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:24:37
It would still be wrong. It never went below $500 on any site where you can buy or sell Bitcoin.
(On the day that it hit $900)
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:08:43
Heh. Linden dollars....
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:06:46
This bot is so cool!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:23:01
For sure. Now I just worry that they will cancel all recurring payments set up today, and say they only worked due to an error.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:35
That made me laugh pretty hard... until I realized 11 is more than old enough to start getting into some shit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:10:00
***Hah!*** If that's true then the US Dollar needs to be dumbed down even more, becuase that stuff has a far more absurb process of creation and introduction to circulation.

mtgox is fine. Coinbase is fine. Search your local Craigslist for sellers, or go to localbitcoins.com to buy with cash. 
You're responsible for the safety of a wallet on your computer, while some company is responsible for an online wallet. 
Browse through the Bitcoin wiki, or just read some of the sidebar links, there's a lot to learn about.

Of course they have coins. The price is just rising so fast that it's not smart to sell more than a set amount.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:39:27
People are actually using it now.

Said every bitter non-bitcoin holder every single day this month.
I just watched my money septuple. Laughing at them the entire way.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:28:15
Give me BTC, please.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:53:58
Alright then, enjoy your magical $475 BTC seller. You're going to be fucking rich.

Nothing that hasn't been covered in the 34753453 identical threads over the past month...
Where the hell are the mods?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:51:01
The que is until Monday, and yes.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:42:45
You clearly didn't read my post. Here, I'll quote it for you.

No Chase offers. :(

Buying is kind of a pain right now. Set up your wallet in Multibit, and copy the huge string of nonsense characters. That's your wallet address.
Farm some bitcoin for free if you want to test your wallet out. This site gives you a few pennies for free once an hour. It cashes out every Monday.
This is called a Bitcoin sink: 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:24:45
You're getting into Bitcoin for the wrong reason then...
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:07:28
You must be new to BTC. It's not going to stop rising any time soon.

I'm not even talking about the non-believers. It's the Bitcoin supporters that just desperately want to buy in low to make some money. 
They're always here talking about their big plans to buy "after the crash."
We will see another group of them in a few months bitching about how they didn't buy when it was below $1000, and they're just waiting for it to crash back to $1500 to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:57:52
My friend that sells BTC is making sales at $500+ right now. It's in the real world.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:44:38


Correct. Delete the .dat file from your computer as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:28:26
This one is equally as stupid.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:48:58
Everyone involved with science uses it. We just don't care enough to force the average hillbilly into it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:15:21
Is BTC under a million billion bazillion dollars?
Yes &gt; buy
No &gt; probably should buy anyway, just in case...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:37:46
I finally got verified too...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:21:34
I would buy so many drugs and bolts of silk or whatever the fuck.
@_date: 2013-09-30 21:25:20
Any retard can secure bitcoins with ~15 minutes of research.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:14:26
OP probably didn't shop around. I just bought for $500/BTC in person today.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:39:29
It never went up to $900, though. They're just making shit up.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:11:01
Up is relative.
EVERYTHING IS FUCKING RELATIVE. IT'S SPACE, BRO.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:32:42
Holy shit dude, I hope you didn't do that. You need more than the address. Please don't spread that false info.
Here's a tutorial: 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:28:39
Bunch of noobs panicked.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:29:31
Contact Coinbase, not reddit....
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:05:18
No it's not. Bitcoin has defied all trends, and can't be predicted using previous methods.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:36:37
Recieved! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:52:59


Switch the order of those two. Be safe, dude. 
Good luck to you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:02:49
Ugh. I just got verified this morning...
I mean, I still have BTC, I just wanted more.

Don't bother mining. You will never mine a bitcoin unless you buy special mining equipment that costs thousands of dollars.
It sounds like you don't really understand what Bitcoin is since you asked "is it too late?" That would be like asking if it's too late to get into US dollars. (In before some of you say yes to that)
Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock. It's meant to be used like other currencies, spent, saved, stored.
