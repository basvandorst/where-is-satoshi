You don't think that they would do the same thing with Bitcoin?

But if you take a graph of the historical price of gold, change the scale, and massively shrink the X axis, it looks *exactly* like Bitcoin sort of. To the moon!

How to win any online political argument:
✖️ Explain why the other person is incorrect, using facts and evidence to support your claim  
✔️ Accuse them of not knowing basic economics without explain a single thing

If you control 51% of the hashing power, you have a 51% probability of mining the next block. If you keep mining blocks, after some period of time you will be guaranteed to have mined a block with the greatest height, and this will be the real chain that everyone will use.
An example: If you had this amount of power, you could make a transaction, wait until it has been confirmed, then re-mine the blocks without including your transaction in it. Eventually, the chain without your transaction will be the best chain.

I enjoy cryptocurrency.
When its popularity increases, I think to myself "yes".
When the price declines, I think to myself "no".

I'm with them. It's based on the country average, even though miners aren't going to mine at a huge loss. They're mining where electricity is cheaper.
If the title were correct, it would use data from actual miners or the 20% percentile of electricity costs or something.

Maybe OP is actually making a 200 IQ point about how going off of simple patterns and comparing charts when deciding when to purchase bitcoin is a bad idea and is using this post specifically to show that buying according to the pattern would have been a poor choice in hindsight.
Or maybe it's a repost. It's probably a repost.

I come to the conclusion that the extreme bull and bear markets of bitcoin are a feature and they speed up the adoption process.
Thread inspired by 
The average person does not know this, but the 2017 Bitcoin bubble was not the first time we saw this significant price rise and rapid decline. There have been countless other bubbles.
$1 -&gt; $30 -&gt; $2.30 (x 30 -92%) - 2011  
$2.30 -&gt; $250 -&gt; $62 (x 108 -75%)  
$62 -&gt; $1,150 -&gt; $154 (x 18 -86%) - 2013/2014  
$154 -&gt; $780 -&gt; $475 (x 5 -39%)  
$475 -&gt; $19,700 -&gt; ? 3,142 ? (x 41 -84%) - 2017/2018
Like I said, these massive price advances along with the massive declines are exactly how bitcoin adoption will continue to play out.
The bull markets bring in the network effects including: technological development (developers), investment (ICE and Fidelity), and security (miners).
The bear market drives out all who really do not understand what Bitcoin is. So they sell and deeply regret it later.
The thousands of people who understand that the characteristics of bitcoin are far superior to all alternative forms of money and that Bitcoin will continue to go through bull and bear cycles for the foreseeable future are called the hodler's of last resort.
They have their stash of bitcoin that will never be sold until full adoption and they continue to buy more bitcoin when it seems cheap.
In fact, many people think price gaps down are bad for Bitcoin. I have come to the conclusion that they are wrong. In fact, the further bitcoin's price falls in a bear market the faster bitcoin adoption will happen.
If a large holder of Bitcoin decided to sell 1 million bitcoin the price may gap down temporarily to 1 cent. This would be super bullish for bitcoin because the long term hodlers of last resort would be able to by 1/21st of the entire supply of bitcoin very easily.
Because these Bitcoin will almost never be sold it effectively takes more bitcoin off the market and creates kindle for the next bull run.
In a bear market, the price will stop falling once supply finally matches demand.
During this time, the supply is high from two things:
1. speculators who jumped in at the end of the last bubble and still don't understand what bitcoin is
2. miners who are mining bitcoin and selling to cover their electricity costs
The demand is from the hodler's of last resort. Those people/businesses/governments who understand bitcoin and are bullish on it long term.
You can see that this base of hodler's of last resort is growing because each low in bitcoins bear market is significantly higher than the previous low.
Once the supply finally matches demand, the price will stabilize, weak hands stop selling and the price begins to move up.
The key part about this is while demand starts increasing again, the supply remains LOW. So when more curious speculators and traders come back the price begins to rise very quickly yet again.
Looking at the past bubbles this is exactly what has happened over and over again...
Scarcity results in supply shortages that cause price increases, price increases attract attention and drive adoption, adoption is people learning about the fundamentals of bitcoin and becoming hodler's of last resort.
This is the cycle that has happened over and over again, and it will continue until full adoption of bitcoin.

I went to look at Gab for myself, and there was a post about how good white nationalism is three posts down. Nice.
Edit: found another great comment on a post calling Democrats communists:


It is ridiculously easy to find content like this scrolling through the popular section. Anyone saying content like this is just a slightly larger fraction of its total content than Twitter is wrong.

Gab is *way* worse than a conservative Reddit. Go look through the popular posts there and I guarantee at least a few of them talk about how bad the Jews are or white supremacy. It's not a "few people".
Reddit has content about games, photos, and tons of other specific subjects. What does Gab have? 24/7 "fuck Democrats", "fuck Muslims", "fuck the Jews", "fuck the globalists". No post is safe from Nazis. I saw a person named 卐 ☠Odin Valhalla ϟϟ 卐✓ᴺᵃᵗᶦᵒᶰᵃˡᶦˢᵗ comment on a picture of an owl. The only good posts are the few "good morning" posts.
You could take Reddit, remove everything except The_Donald, make it a Twitter clone, and it still wouldn't be a fraction as bad as Gab.

As long as you can draw on a graph, you can convince others of anything on this sub. Overlay BTC and the Dow Jones (on different time scales of course, to be extra misleading). Make up some weird pattern (every a + bx days, the price of Bitcoin makes a U-shape). It doesn't even have to be a pattern. Just give a single example of something happening before (BTC went up 18 months before a halving). Then you get upvoted.
