Wow, thanks. I surely wasn't understanding the top posts here in a good while...

Thank's for clarifying it.

What I meant with it is that I was storing it only on the computer. No online backups, nor an offline one.

Thanks a lot, man!

That's exactly the conclusion I'm getting to. I'll just tell myself that I spent this money learning to always have backups and think twice before formatting.

Hey man, have you ever done an AMA? It would be really interesting, imo

Not even close. I've seen the promo videos and was looking forward for the update. And even before updating, I read some reviews and watched some comparison videos. I did it because I wanted.
And again, the problem wasn't the OS, but me formatting the computer without a backup. The OS thing is what made me format in the first place, but it's not what made me lose the btc.

Yeah... That's the problem. I don't have one. But now I guess I learned my lesson. haha

Yeah, me neither. But if you check the numbers, this is probably due to a higher average value in transactions. The number of trades is not much greater than Mercado Bitcoin's...

If you read again, you might see the problem wasn't the OS, but me. There was a problem during the update, and after solving it a could have done a backup before formatting. The problem is I didn't.
