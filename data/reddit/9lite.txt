I don't think an 8 cent fee is possible today. Are you sure that wasn't the fee imposed by the exchange on top of the bitcoin transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:40:50
Nope, double spending is impossible. Only one confirmed spend can ever be placed on the blockchain.

Obviously varies from place to place, but I know landlords in my city are all basically ripping off students with extremely high rent and compulsory high cost bills packages. As long as it's within the terms of the lease there's nothing wrong with using what you pay for. If they're making the most of you, you might as well make the most out of them.

Maybe he's right if he's thinking about the big-big picture. But you have to remember that Bitcoin is already far more efficient and effective in keeping a ledger than any other fiat currency out there today.
If anything, without realising, he is suggesting that blockchain technology is the next stepping stone, but that there will always be something better further down the road.

Academics tend to do that, mainly because they don't know all of the details and it allows them to bluff their way through tricky questions!

I'm currently doing a similar thing to which you suggest, I too have free electricity until around June. I went a bit crazy and got 5 other graphics cards, a PSU, an old motherboard, and a few jumpers. Invested around £500 in total buying mostly from eBay and Gumtree. Picked up couple of rx480s, a gtx970, gtx980, gtx1060, and I'm now making around £20/week mining ZCash. Definitely a huge project, and a giant pain to set up and keep running (heat is a bigger issue than you might think in a small space like a dorm room for eg). I'd only suggest doing it if you have a genuine interest, as generally in such short time frames you won't make much of a profit. Most of the profit comes from selling the cards at the end of it. Good luck.

This is very well written. Thanks for your view.

I'm finding that I'm uploading around 20GB a day, downloading a mere fraction of that.

I think people forget that you upvote content only if it contributes to the discussion, not necessarily if it is in favour or against your point of view.
The above is very well expressed and helped me further my understanding of the current situation.
If it is true, and the BU folk already have their hands on enough hashing power, are they not activating the fork because they understand that BU isn't robust enough for what Bitcoin needs to be?

Average, probably not. Burst usage I could see possibly being a problem which may affect your latency in game. It might be worth looking to see if you've got any rate limiting options in your router.

This isn't a fair comparison. Bitcoin started at 0 value which warps this view horribly.

I haven't bought any Bitcoin in months. I'm happy to ride that mean average line to be honest.

Isn't that a little risky? I thought converting money I already own was living life on the edge.

The old one was counterfeit so much there was a high percentage of fake coins in circulation, with little way to easily prove their authenticity.

Uncertainty is what brings about change in the markets. If the result was unexpected, you can expect to see a sharp fall in USD. Neither party has particular policies regarding Bitcoin, so don't expect Bitcoin to see growth except for the case of a USD meltdown.
However in all I think during this period especially there's not an outcome of this election that will result in the poor performance of BTC, a good time to invest imo.

It's always a good time to buy. These price differences won't even be a blip on the chart in 5 years time.

I know this is a Bitcoin sub, but have you considered a cryptocurrency with smart contracts? You could create one such that funds only become available for a given address on a date in the future etc. Maybe not what you're after, but consideration.

The price should have been this high before but was pushed down by Segwit &amp; BU bickering. Confidence in BU falling and Litecoin's adoption of Segwit sheds a more progressive light on Bitcoin's future.
