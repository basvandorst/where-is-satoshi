Dumb as shit, and wasted time reading. 
There is no way, to get them out. As verification will not happen in the chain.

Holly molly! Guess he needs to fund his mania! Thanks for the info

Been expected. So  thought I'd get out and jump on the ripple wave:-) I've seen worse, I agree 3% is not that bad. The reason for this fast curve, was not expected. 
Guess we need to send our gratitude to The rocket man.
Lol! Feel bad for those who lost their btc tho:-/

Make a copy first before messing around with it.
The early original wallet was in a unique format.
 
You will have to use Bitcoin Core because no other wallet uses the wallet.dat format. Furthermore, the wallet format has changed over time, and only the latest version of Bitcoin Core will work with all of them. Just download and install Bitcoin Core, start it and let it create the datadir. Then stop Bitcoin Core, put the wallet.dat file in the Bitcoin Core data folder, replacing whatever wallet.dat file is automatically created, and start it again. You may need to start Bitcoin Core with -upgradewallet for the wallet to work properly

Back off my friend.
It's a scam.
There in not any Bitcoin that is non spending.
You have Bitcoin in you wallet, or you don't. 
It's is not possible for him to reverse the transaction. 
Sounds to me that your using a fake Bitcoin wallet. 
Where he controls what you see.
