@_date: 2019-07-06 12:08:29
If he got his hands on his coins that were Kleinmand ain't that stealing?
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:26:17
I hope they lock this phony up! Never seen a person as arrogant as him in my life. The only person that lies more then him is Donald Trump. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:25:23
They'd probably all be on bitcoin cash sub or bitcoin SV wait bitcoin SV don't have a sub. Lol

What's wrong with the link? If your going to tell me to post normal links then tell me what's wrong with the link so I don't do it again?

Cause itx fun to watch a train wreck.

I wouldn't  store bitcoins in my node wallet. That's for hardware wallets. Your phone wallet is better for storing a small amount because you carry it around with you. However node wallet are great for sending your bitcoins that's what I use mine for. I only send bitcoin to it if I'm going to use it that day. Much more private and secure way of sending your bitcoins. I think they have the new core wallet now that will integrate with your hardware wallet.

Lmao I was looking at that the other day....����
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:05:37
If 96% of all transactions are coming from a weather app then how would they have their own sub? Lol, What they probably have 4 people subscribed to it. Craig Wright and the 3 employees that work for his crypto scam altcoin... ����
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:58:24
What a looser.
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:25:55
Oh ok I will definitely try that. Thank you so much for responding. I was about to give up and go back to default node wallet.

Baby steps first
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:38:00
Hey that Dogo software is so you can run wallet on your own node and not a third party node right?
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:20:31
Plus itd good to see karma come back to bite this guy in the ass.����

Got that right.

That's not right banks loose money when people default on their mortgages. They don't want to hold all these homes and have to auction them for a fraction of the value of the defaulted mortgage. Banks make their money lending money. When economy goes sour and people can't pay them back they ain't making money. Then their looking to the tax payer to bail them out! Just like 2008.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:29:40
A store of value totally agree. That is bitcoins main use right now.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:33:49
That's right you tell um kids! You guys will be the future of bitcoin. Stay strong and keep accumulating bitcoin. It will pay off big for you in the future.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:51:59
It's terrible next recession right around the corner, gonna be the worst.
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:57:51
Yea the BACKBONE the foundation that makes bitcoin what it is today!!
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:42:56
Hodlers keep the dips in price from being way more severe.
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:51:56
Hodlers are the true Hero's of Bitcoin. Without us value of bitcoin wouldn't be half of what it is today.
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:14:18
Ok thanks what should I do to get link from actual publisher? Are most of them Google trackers? I normally use duckduckgo or startpage as my search engines would that help?
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:23:22
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:00:19
Yea I was thinking the same thing cause you have to use a different port with tor.
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:33:58
Yea that was the bottle neck. Eventually the external hard drive couldn't take it anymore and quit working. So I downloaded blockchain to my hard internal hard drive and it only took 2 days.
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:24:22
That's right and we are coming up on a huge recession in the next year or 2.
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:42:01
Yea your exposure to high.
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:01:04
I will when I get home.
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:26:22
By constantly printing more money will cause hyper inflation. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:48:54
Don't get me wrong this is a good thing for bitcoin adoption. Bakkt is not in it because they want to help bitcoin. They want to make money. When bitcoins market cap is in the trillions and price stabilizes then people will stop using it as a speculative asset. Then it will be adopted as a currency. Until then I guess this is the baby steps it will have to take.
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:04:04
You should get square cash app. Its super easy to buy bitcoin on their app. All you need is your bank debit card. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:29:31
Right it no different then bitpay or BTC.com
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:25:09
But don't they both speed up transaction times when sending your bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:30:36
Is that the same as a recurring buy order?
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:57:34
I do buy from exchange with fiat.
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:53:22
Will he be coming out with android version?
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:40:47
Excellent read so true.
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:48:27
Bitcoin all ready has this sort of thing with crypto.com bitpay and others. People must remember bakkt doesn't want to do good for bitcoin. They are part of wallstreet. It's about how much money they can make.
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:10:16
Yes they are. I have my core wallet node running through tor. Also my samori is running through tor. I dont know how that might effect my setup. I used my static ip address of the computer my node is running on. Also I have VPN on the computer my full node is running on. I also have VPN service on the tablet the samori wallet is on. Could this play a part in why it's not connecting?
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:55:04
You think they will make android version of that wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:00:14
It's real bitcoin you can keep it in the app they have cold storage. You can withdrawal it into your personal bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-09 16:11:19
Why do they not have fees?
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:04:24
All have to do is open your eyes and you will see all the fiat faiiling around the world.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:51:08
It already is used as a everyday currency to some degree.
@_date: 2018-10-23 13:23:39
It's way early into bitcoin there is always new technology like the lightening network to speed up transaction times.
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:55:28
Thats right keep collecting as much as you can afford and hodl. We may never see prices this low again.
@_date: 2018-10-28 09:30:07
Good cause i got that wallet
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:18:27
Cool what's the point in even using regular coin base. I'm using coinbase pro from now on
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:56:45
Yea these guys with ttheir techical analysis shit. They always predict bitcojn price both ways. They say bitcoin about to make a big move. It could hit this price resistance and make big move up. Or fail to go above this price resistance and make big move down with the bears. That way they're never wrong. All BULLSHIT. They dont really know just guessing.��
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:54:20
Your buying real bitcoin you can choose to withdrawal it into your personal bitcoin wallet. You can keep it in the app they have cold storage. If you keep it in app you can sell it when price goes up and it goes back in your checking account.
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:20:03
Do you have to be a trader to use coinbasepro. Can you buy small orders of bitcoin like $50 to maybe $200 worth.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:53:00
@_date: 2018-10-31 14:20:55
Life without parole, for running a darkweb website that sold drugs, ridiculous . People who commit double murder sometimes get lesser sentences. Goverment was trying to make example out of him. Didnt work more DNM then ever.
@_date: 2018-10-31 15:53:04
Is spv for smaller transactions?
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:50:14
Actually it has got a lot better then it used to be. Their used to be huge price differences between exchanges maybe hudreds of dollars. Now most are within $50 of one anotber.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:56:41
I think they charged him with kingpen charges, also bullshit when he was basically acting as a middle man not the one actually selling the drugs.
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:49:57
Oh ok I didn't know that.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:43:27
He or she is right who could have bitcoin would be where it is today.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:54:36
Shapeshift got bullied by governments in to making people give up their info to use there service.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:44:55
What about shapeshift to monero then use xmr.to to change bac to bitcoin thats what i currently do?
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:32:35
Thanks ill have to do my homework because i ussally buy some every week no matter what tthe price.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:02:37
Its real bitcoin you can withdrawl it to your personal wallet
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:17:34
Maybe conf file in wrong folder?
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:59:11
It's real bitcoin you can keep it in the app they have cold storage. You can withdrawal it into your personal bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-27 10:08:47
When will the android version be released?
@_date: 2018-10-27 10:25:31
Good point. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:48:58
You was right bro they do have a website. I just used it to convert some btc to xmr worked like a charm. Faster then shapeshift to, thanks for the tip, sometimes its the obvious things we miss.
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:40:06
What do you mean by done?
@_date: 2018-10-13 22:49:25
You could also try local bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:46:22
Ok that sucks
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:55:30
Your buying real bitcoin you can choose to withdrawal it into your personal bitcoin wallet. You can keep it in the app they have cold storage. If you keep it in app you can sell it when price goes up and it goes back in your checking account.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:31:45
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:03:32
Yea its a awsome app i use a lot. You can even keep it in the app and sell it back when the price goes up and the money goes into your checking account. I always withdrawl but if you wanted to you could.
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:21:47
So you have to be a trader not a hodler?
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:59:18
I agree 60 and 300k are not gonna happen but 25k is possible.
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:49:31
No your really buying bitcoin. You can withdrawl it and put in in your personal bitcoin wallet. You can keep it in the app. I think they have cold storage. You can sell it in the app also.
@_date: 2018-10-20 01:14:15
Can i get that wallet on android?
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:52:04
Yea thats right i would never use coinbase as a private wallet. If you tumble your bitcoin or change it to monero then back to bitcoin using xmr.to and make sure to never use same address twice hd wallets do that automatically i think and be sure to hide your ip address you should be ok. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:26:12
Thats all anybody doing anyway guessing. Even the so called experts. At least i didnt say it was gonna go to 50,000 by the end of the year like this other asshole. Just my opinion buddy. Their lime assholes everybody has one.��
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:58:08
Maybe 10k by years end. Maybe 50k by 2020 or 21
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:28:19
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:09:50
What ever
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:15:37
Yeah you can keep it in app or withdrawl it into your personal bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:28:58
Is there a android version of that wallet? Isnt it the same as coinjoin? Anyway thanks for the link very interesting and important.
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:46:25
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:27:59
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:42:35
Cash app is a good option. Fees are cheaper and supet easy to buy and sell. All you need is your banks atm card.
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:26:52
You might be right never thought about doing that.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:08:29
If their going buy OTC it wont effect the price of bitcoin or will it?
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:13:19
I should run my own node so I  can  validate my own transactions
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:08:27
Why does this damn reddit app keep telling me something went wrong when I try to reply to message
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:07:17
Engin is a very secure mobile wallet
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:01:39
Good i do have that wallet. It would be so much better if the wallets have this feature. Coinjoin is hard to figure out how to use, at least it is for me.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:06:45
It's real bitcoin you can keep it in the app they have cold storage. You can withdrawal it into your personal bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:30:59
Dont spend something that will probably triple in value in the next 3 years.
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:05:09
Mycelium with out question is the best mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:19:34
Will bitcoins be purchased OTC?
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:04:51
Liquid network lightening network. I wish they whould make up their mind.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:13:56
Real bitcoin you can withdrawl
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:41:29
Yea thats what i thought.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:29:10
I had 2 words that were the same on my bread wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-30 01:25:31
What does that have to do with bitcoins price? Closer it get to 21,000,000 the more valuable bitcoin becomes..
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:56:57
Fiat is a terrible currency not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:56:20
Thats cool i will do that thanks.��
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:51:51
Any alternatives to shapeshift that trade bitcoin for monero?
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:03:40
Yeah I guess so.
@_date: 2018-10-20 01:25:05
Have any idea when you might release it?
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:59:45
Oh i see. I did hear  about the bug, but i didnt know bprivate cryptographic assumptions were weaker.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:38:21
Not anonymous because your transaction shows up on blockchain. You have to be careful the way you use it. Always good to use a well trusted no log vpn to your true ip private. If someone is able to link an identity to your wallet address then they will find out who made the transaction. Always tumble bitcoins from an exchange or buy bitcoins with cash.
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:22:48
Ok gotcha
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:33:24
Yeah they tried to say he hired somebody to kill two people but the hits never happened I dont think. Bullshit the government dreamed up.
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:57:07
No it dont
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:45:51
Yea I agree with the other comments you cant go wrong with either. The main purpose of a hardware wallet is so your private keys are stored off line in the device itself. They both do that obviously. So pick one or the other and you will be fine and your bitcoin will be safe.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:53:23
There are two positions you can take on a futures contract: long or short.
If you take a long position, you agree to buy an asset in the future at a specific price when the contract expires. When you take a short position, you agree to sell an asset at a set price when the contract expires.
A good way to explain this is using the example of an airline who wants to hedge against the rising price of fuel by entering into a futures contract.
Say jet fuel trades at $2 per gallon. An airline expecting the price of oil to rise, buys a three-month futures contract for 1,000 gallons at current prices. The contract is, therefore, worth $2,000.
If in three months, when the contract expires, the price of one gallon of jet fuels is $3, the airline saved $1,000.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:28:56
That's a fucked up thing to say to someone who has a legitament question. I'm sure their are plenty of people that dont know how future contracts work.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:08:52
No president has had more corruption in their administration then Donald Trump.

Depends on how bad farmers are hurt by the Chinese US. trade wars. Also how fast the global recession gets here. It also depends on the democratic rival he runs against.  It needs to be someone who is not to far to the left. Imo
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:56:36
That's true but that didnt stop all those people buying altcoins they new nothing about in 2017. I'm not mad about dumb money pumping my  bags. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:47:56
So is it the wallet the person is using deanonymized not the identity of the person using the wallet? If one uses a well trusted no log vpn or tor to hide their true ip address wouldnt they be ok?
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:23:28
Invest $500 put it on a trezor or any hard wallet of your choice stash it somewhere safe and check back in 5 to 10 years. I think you will be shocked at how much money it will be worth, happily shocked.
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:38:44
It wouldn't. People think that because a lot of people buying bitcoin will use tether to buy it.. They would just use a different stable coin. Imo Mostly the people buying significant amounts of bitcoin use tether.
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:22:22
Are you saying it doesn't? If you are then you are living in denial my friend.
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:52:14
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:05:58
Yeah Biden is a little old. I think he would be the one to put against Trump. He is more torwards the center. He wouldn't try to totally revamp the health care system to Medicare for all. This would never work in US. Way to big of country to try that. It would be way way to expensive. That works in smaller population countries like Canada or UK but would not work here.  Imo
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:41:21
Yes so we agree. Americans voted in a moron president.
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:45:23

@_date: 2019-06-17 10:37:18
Wow didnt know that.

Hilarious post. I'm sure new people to bitcoin having to shift through all these forks off of bitcoin, that all kept bitcoin in their name is a little confusing
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:14:11
You never know. I hope not though he's such a Deuche bag.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:05:13
How easy is it? Is it your own node or a third party node?
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:06:58
If you live in USA and have a bank account you could use cash app and buy with your bank account.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:34:35
Ok you could move some to another wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:05
How can I boost it on blockchain wallet? I normally  use samori wallet where its very easy to boost TRN fee.

Yep that's right. He could move some bitcoin from the genesis block to prove it, couldn't he?
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:31:14
Nah I was talking about crypto wallets. Your fucking with me right?
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:53:59
Most people know how to wash their coins if need be.
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:42:32
Why it's fun to hear about how much of a jackass he's making himself look like in front of the judge. Cracks me up ������ One lie after the other, crying in court its hilarous!
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:51:43
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:15:49
Why does testnet come up when I click on the core icon?
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:12:08
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:11:37
Yes you should be able to do that.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:11:10
People are waking up to the fact Trump bamboozled them. They found out in reality he was a fraud and only ran for president to promote his brand. He never ran because he gave a shit about his country.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:34:17
Ok thank you.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:24:10
I do use cash app sometimes to buy bitcoin. I think it's better for  buying then coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:37:16
Dude your making no sense. The next halving in 2020 they will be producing half of what they were in 2019 and the other 3 years prior to 2019.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:59:51
I'm telling you you should definatly try this. It's been running smooth so far for me.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:00:20
Do you have control of your private keys? If you dont you really dont own the bitcoin or what ever crypto you have in the wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:06:16
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:00:15
Yep they did that to I forgot about that one. I don't think they call your employer to prove it though.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:52:24
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:48:27
Get a hard wallet if you don't already have one. Trevor is good. That's the one I use. Good advice stop telling people how much you have.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:04:23
Cash app asked I told them Amazon but they didnt want to know which one or my employers phone #
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:07:05
I know can't figure out how to boost it on blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:38:42
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:05:54
Ok so about how much space?
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:22:16
About 1 hour
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:31:36
I'll post that stuff for you.
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:40:57
If I update my electrum through Google play store it will give me  the correct version? I got the message also on my phones wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:05:47
Thanks you know the electrum on tails same thing even when I downloaded the latest version.
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:14:27
I have the same problem when I shutdown then restart wallet it gets stuck syncing again. I go to ping a peer like you said and their is 0 nodes listed. No active connection to network. Wheir can I find a list of active nodes?
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:51:04
Thanks. I found out it was my tor config. I didn't have the right box checked. I'm a dumb ass. Lol��������
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:10:14
You sure it's been stuck on 99.98% for quite a while?
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:14:06
I reset the conf file to default. That seemed to have fixed it.
@_date: 2019-02-15 10:50:08
Did I specify a data directory I thought was testnet? Was that comment in one of the threads on this post? Because I cant find it.
@_date: 2019-02-15 10:19:32
I never use my core node to store bitcoin because of its private keys being always store online. I sign transactions with my cold storage wallet. Only used for sending bitcoin. So I'm in no danger of losing bitcoins. I just want to know why testnet wallet comes up when I click on my core wallet icon. How do I fix this ?
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:31:21
How many gigs for the how thing?)
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:38:36
Whould tails electrum wallet also be effected by this malware?
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:30:10
Da never mind I'm such a dumb ass it's on the laptop in the post...��������
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:55:06
I'd say that's probably ten years down the road. Still a lot of thing to work out in terms of user friendly features with cash app. Unless you use some of the custodial wallets.
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:47:15
It was my tor configuration I wasn't using the hidden service. Everything good now but thanks for your advice anyway I really do appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:58:35
Damn I didn't mean cashapp I meant user friendly features in lightening network so people can use their own nodes in their lightening wallets. Sorry for the mix up .
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:49:10
Yeah eventually. On samori wallet their is a way to boost your fee after it was sent. Not on this wallet. It sucks! I should have used my bitcoin core wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:54:29
Trezer I meant to say.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:32:52
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:36:28
If their producing half the bitcoin they were the year before then that does create scarcity. Their will be half the number mined then the year before doesn't matter how many are already mined. It's a way to hedge against inflation. Less mined therefore price goes up.
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:12:52
I fixed it by resetting the conf file back to default settings . That seemed to do the trick. Thanks for your advice I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:13:22
Yep who the hell is buying that fake bitcoin he created. Seems like its pumping every time I  check coinmarketapp
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:04:55
Eventually their will be no block reward. If that doesn't make bitcoin more scarce then I don't know what does.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:29:20
No where near what he claims to have. I'll bet that.
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:06:39
Your saying you tried this method and had problems?
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:12:25
Attacker would more likely try to steal your password through phishing or social engineering techniques. P
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:28:25
Yeah lot easier to do then brute force. I'm not sure how easy it would be to do a brute force on a 12 word seed. Although 256aes is more secure I believe 128 would be sufficient.  I definitely could be wrong on the brute force on 12,words. I guess better to get wallet with 24 word seed.
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:34:14
I hope so. I'm sure they do.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:47:34
This is the type of liquidity bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:07:56
Ledger is a good hard wallet too. I never heard of Leonel is that new?
@_date: 2019-06-07 01:01:17
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:09:52
Ok I'll try that. Damn if I would have known it was gonna be this much of a pain I wouldn't have downloaded test net. Lol
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:54:22
How did you know that path?
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:13:32
Yea the idea of running the wallet on your own node is to make sure all the rules are followed. Its is important for people to run their own nodes though to insure decentralization. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:52:02
Yep its safer to use monero anyway. Most people dont know how to do the things with bitcoin to hide their transaction. Plus to get the full privacy benefit for bitcoin you should be running a full node.
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:24:39
July 22 I believe
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:54:53
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:59:50
I believe it.
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:45:17
In my opinion we haven't been through capitulation stage yet. Is it impossible period no. Their will be another bullrun. It will be after we go through the capitulation phase. All markets work in this manner.
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:00:37
You can download on playstore.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:54:54
No it's just a hypothetical situation. I know they will never be able to shut them all down.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:32:47
I would instead of trying to pay with the cash app itself in bitcoin, withdrawal the bitcoin to a wallet of your choice and use it to pay in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:01:19
Very true
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:37:05
Yep that would be a good start.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:37:02
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:15:48
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:32:49
Yep exactly right that's what I do.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:32:06
Your right about that. That's monero main use case
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:03:02
Make sure to right down your mnemonic word seed. This will back up wallet in case you lose your phone.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:28:55
They need to get the infrastructure in place so employers can start paying their workers in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:57:56
Sorry my bad. Wallpaper.
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:11:57
You have to specify that you want to buy with your debit card and not your bank account.
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:53:47
Shitcoins can stick around as long as they know their place and their purpose, too make bitcoin better..✌✌
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:54:54
I would recommend electrum it's a good wallet for noobs.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:46:21
If your not experienced trader I would not try leverage trading. 99% of traders lose money trading bitcoin. Only the whales and professionals make money. The average Joe Blow wins a trade here and there gets that pump of serotonin and becomes addicted. Not much different from gambling. Dollar cost average and you will do much better. And you wont get rekt! Lol
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:23:45
I know I was surprised at the date because the you tubers were covering it today like it was fresh news.
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:09:25
So that's with your linked bank card or your linked bank account?
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:08:21
I did read a lot of stuff on that link when I was getting started in bitcoin. Thanks for sending it though.
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:20:39
That why I downloaded testnet in case of fuckup.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:03:44
Me too
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:35:55
I got a chat request from this person.  Wanted me to join some sketchy company that traded bitcoin for you.
@_date: 2019-02-15 00:18:55
Iv been running a core node for a while with no problems. I just recently set up the lightening node. The lightening node is running on powershell. Getting the wallet to use my own node has,been a challenge.  What kind of disasters am I looking at? 
@_date: 2019-12-11 03:42:05
You can link your coinbase account with your debit bank card as well. Then you dont have to wait.
@_date: 2019-12-11 03:44:50
Why do you think they banned your account?
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:23:17
They shouldn't have made you wait of it was with your debit card.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:44:10
They are almost always wrong. Guess well be in this downtrend for another 6 months. Lol����
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:29:46
Yes your recovery seed is basically your private keys it regenerates your private keys so you can get your bitcoin back as far as I know. Anybody can correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:31:34
Whatever what would I possibly have to gain from kissing somebodies ass on a social media site. It's not like I work for the guy.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:00:32
No bro I know bitcoin is not just about price. I'm a bag hodler been holding through bear market and dollar cost averaging for 3 years. I was just curious on what peoples opions were. If it were just about price I would have sold on the run up to 14k.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:09:06
Lol I hear ya
@_date: 2019-04-14 03:04:04
Criminals why because you believed all the fake news that was sent to your Facebook feed.. Gimmi a break if anybody was doing anything illegal its Donald J Trump. His administration has been loaded with corruption.
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:13:40
Good! They should be mining for the real bitcoin not the fake one.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:49:11
Or monero or xmr.to.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:17:23
Isn't their a company out their that already does that?
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:04:50
Although the Russians made mistakes in their bitcoin usage.  It goes to show if the government wants to find out who you are their gonna find out bitcoin or no bitcoin.

What ever dude Trump is to stupid to fuck anybody let alone run the country. What a joke. Worst president in history by far.

Never none of them even came close.
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:57:05
Yep that's why his bitcoins SV will soon be dead. That's the good thing about bitcoin it will never die because it has no head to that can be chopped off.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:51:53
It does require kyc but that's no different then most exchanges in the US.
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:55:37
Yea they did but didnt make a difference did it.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:59:08
Up the transaction fee on your wallet high enough so your transaction gets put into the 3rd block after you press send. Should only take 30 min
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:10:19
Ok you dont have to bud.
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:59:39
absolutly agree him and his brother Roger Verr both pushing fake versions of bitcoin. Complete fraudsters.
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:55:30
I agree
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:09:12
Yea I guess it was pretty bad.
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:08:41
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:32:35
Your right that's the one I was thinking of purse.io but like you said they dont support it through lightening. You think they would have been the first to do it through lightening since they were already doing it through on chain bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-14 03:13:14
What the hell are you saying have you even heard this man speak. He cant even put together coherent  sentences.  As for bringing the country to an economic boom. I think not this countries economy was already recovering from the previous administration.  This guy has people like you completely bamboozled  He is an embarrassment to the country. Wake up man.
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:56:21
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:03:34
Amen brother. 
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:45:04
All you need to do is think about this. There have been 5000 altcoins come since bitcoin debut in 2008. All claiming to be the next big thing. There have been coins like ethereum litecoin claiming to be a better bitcoin with their fancy smart contracts. DURING ALL THAT TIME NOT ONE OF THEM HAVE CHALLENGED BITCOINS  MARKET CAPITALIZATION SPOT. Most of those coins aren't even around anymore. So you tell me why anyone would waste their money investing in shitcoins...������
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:18:55
That would be cool..
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:10:45
I meant amen to sharing knowledge with others not that you were an over opinionated jerk. Just wanted to clarify that. Lol
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:53:03
Me? NEVER.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:48:16
I know i spelled it wrong. Always got the spell check police on my ass....��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️��.lol just kidding.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:04:40
Get you own wallet so you can get your bitcoin off the exchange as soon as you can.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:18:51
So throw that note away and see somebody to get some help.
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:02:59
Really which ones?
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:24:41
Im surprised they haven't suspended your coinbase account.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:15:04
Roger Ver the bitcoin cash guy. That's the only name of the 3 I'm familiar with.
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:51:58
Sounds just like futures. That's what is so different with bakkt and the Vanesk ETF they're backed by actual bitcoin not fiat.
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:42:43
Really? Taking a risk doing it. You never know when that day could come when your luck runs out.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:40:38
Is it gmail
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:57:06
Why did you say you sent from a coinbase wallet not the exchange?
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:36:23
Matter of fact i own a copy of the book.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:50:26
The other names i dont know. Sorry bout that brother.
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:59:10
Just like the privacy coins if and when bitcoin adopts privacy protocols like Dandelion.  Then you will see their market cap drop dramatically.  Altcoins are a good testing ground for bitcoin to see what works and what doesnt.
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:11:41
Square cash app. If you dont have it get it: 
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:47:12
Sure can i do it all the time. Cheaper then an exchange too.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:52:24
Me to
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:06:04
Good point never thought of it like that.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:06:33
That's weird maybe some kind of defect on back of it.
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:45:17
Yeah i understand their going to be cash settled so wont drive up price. Bakkt and the  Vanek ETF will be settled with physical bitcoin so that will drive up price. Either way i still want the bear market to last longer so i can accumulate more. The price will skyrocket in 2019 or 2020. If you dont see that you ain't paying attention
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:56:30
Actually they sell at a better price then coinbase. You can leave it on app and sell it back to them at market value and it goes right back to your checking account. Most people withdrawl to personal wallet I assume that's what I do.
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:03:11
That's awesome. Must have cool employer.
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:41:07
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:22:13
Tankyou... ������
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:10:16
You said you didnt have to give them any of your personal info right?
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:43:22
Oh really that sucks.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:17:30
They let you use Amazon giftcard to buy bitcoin on coinbase?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:49:16
I just got into bitcoin about a year ago. Sorry if i dont know the name of every person that was involved. I could know the names but not the faces. Like Roger Ver i knew the name but not the face
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:02:15
You could use a tumbler if you do though better make sure its one you can trust. I would do it 50 at a time. They have been known to keep peoples bitcoin. You could use local bitcoins and buy in cash. The best way is to get a monero wallet. Change your bitcoin to monero with morphtoken its like shapeshift no id required. After you do that use xmr.to to change it back to a bitcoin wallet you own. Make sure this  is done using a no log vpn or tor. I would recomend Nord VPN. This will hide your true ip address which can be used to find out who you are. Here is a link to Morphtoken  This should keep you somewhat safe. Unless the government is after you. I dont think you have to worry about that. I hope. If you can buy your bitcoin with cash no id that would be the best most safe.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:01:59
How do bitcoin derivatives work?
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:18:29
I agree with this totally, i would even go as far as to say their stealing bitcoin. Iv had some wierd thing happen when i send a certain amount of bitcoin then i look at tranaction it shows the original amount i sent but then a certain amount goes into another wallet. Could be i dont understand what im looking at. The wallet your seding to never gets the full amount. I could be mistaking but never had this problem with other wallets.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:22:22
I hear ya I'm in the same boat. I'm gonna keep buying though. Not as much I feel like it will definitely recover. Might take year or two. Just be patient and hodl.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:26:50
I wouldnt send it from their wallet. You should get a personal wallet send it to that wallet from your site then to DNM wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:04:39
Yea that's that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:42:22
I dont care about that as long as I can get my bitcoin. So he believed in censorship. Doesn't reddit censor your post? I think they do. You cant put anything out on post that you want.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:04:55
I heard that.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:54:25
Yea they are. I was surprised how many people didn't know about it.
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:39:00
Really what for?
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:19:03
Oh ok I got it. Yea that is true.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:59:21
I think you fucking with me.�� aint you?
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:30:42
You never know if goverment agency could go to paxful and force them to give up your ip address, not saying thats gonna happen so dont get worked up. Just be a little more careful.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:07:07
Why I'm not understanding what your saying. They will buy it back and money goes in your account.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:19:43
That is so true. Great post.
@_date: 2018-11-03 13:14:09
So maybe i was mistaking. Stop laughing at me.....��������.lol����

CPU% Avetage from about 12% to 30% it fluctuates. Yes I did restart when I made the changes.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:51:20
Yea same here. We just got to remember its never going to be a straight line to get to wheir we want to go. There is always going to be peaks and valleys, just like the bitcoin chart. Lol����

@_date: 2019-01-18 10:21:39
I  think most markets follow these four year cycles. Maybe?
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:43:03
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:42:49
Maybe i thought i read somewhere where their prices are cheaper. Makes sense since your buying in bulk seems like you whould get it cheaper.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:17:29
Im not sure about the prepaid debit card. I think you have to use your banks debit card. Thats how i did it. You dont have to go through near the bullshit as you do signing up for an exchange such as coinbase. Enter your bank debit card number send picture of id front and back and a quick selfie, thats it. The id part and selfie is if you want to withdrawl coins to your personel wallet. But you only do it once then your set.
@_date: 2018-11-09 10:38:20
Whats thats got to do with cashapp?
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:32:39
That's what I think. Just cant figure out what.
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:03:11
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:07:48
I'm going on 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:07:26
Maybe you should contact their support.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:53:12
Not sure but I would think so.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:58:16
Took me a few trays to get it. So you got the front side done?
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:09:33
Damn no shit. I was gonna use raspberry pie for my bitcoin node instead of my computer.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:39:59
Ok thank you so much. That's what I was going to do but wasn't sure. Anyway that worked thanks again.
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:10:05
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:42:15
Yea I could but I was saying for the average Joe on the street it will be easy for them to use. The person that is totally unfamiliar with bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:02:19
Thanks by the way.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:20:55
What do you mean stucked?
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:14:45
I can you know how many worthless altcoins are out their. Thousands.
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:07:27
I know that but if only a couple of people are using your coin then I would venture to say that's pretty low demand. Plus a lot of these coins run off the profits  from their coins. So if demand is low and your way down the list on market cap. Then bitcoin takes another big drop they just wont have the money to keep their projects going.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:13:59
No No dont do that jesus. If nothing has happened yet you probably be ok. I just want you to be careful. Sorry didn't mean to scare you that bad.
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:05:51
Bitcoin very easy to aquire just get square cash app. Simple as a couple clicks on your cell phone.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:22:27
Im not. If your sending bitcoin to DNM from your coinbase account. You got to clean that dirty bitcoin. That bitcoin can be traced backed to your actual idenity.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:27:13
Cool its requires some third party custodialship of your coins. I dont think the average person that's knows nothing about crypto will care. I guess that's the price for how user friendly it is. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:53:51
No I think I was replying to somebody else's comment and forgot to hit the reply button I guess. I was probably half asleep. Lol��
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:56:41
Tell you the truth I wouldn't mind if bear markef last another year. Give me chance to a accumulate    more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:34:29
Could be. It hasn't been losing connection that I know of.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:31:08
Yea i did read the bitcoin standard. I skipped through the part about the history of money. It was a tad boring to me. Ill go back through it. Just for you my brother. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:25:26
I think bitcoin is going to take that rocket ship to the moon very soon. Yea ����
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:05:01
Your dad awsome reminds me of myself. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:10:20
Yeah I know I'm gonna check it out. Just didn't want to put the hash out their for everyone to see. For various reasons.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:53:19
Its just alot more fun to see price go up.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:59:29
That's true makes sense. Thanks.��
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:32:57
I do have a ubuntu virtual machine and a whonix virtual machine on my windows computer. I want to  switch to linux eventually. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:48:20
All you need is your banks atm card.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:16:20
Until we see a reversal we are still in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:19:45
It is available in UK
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:56:01
Yea probably right but really it's no different then any SPV lightweight wallet that's required some third party trust.
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:03:02
They know what about to happen. Thats why they are buying up as much bitcoin as possible at these discounted prices. Plus an extra discount for OTC buying.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:23:43
Whatever you dont know when I got into bitcoin. What dont you agree with the post. Its comes from several news sources in the space. So keep your dumb ass noob comments to yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:32:33
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:52:48
I'm agree with that I'm just saying VanEck had to withdrawl until this shit clears up. I'm saying the shutdown delays possible things that could have a possible effect on price 
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:25:43
Yea that's what I'm saying. If your going by ath then what you think is the bottom then when it went above what you perceived as the bottom then the bear market is over and then your suddenly in a bull market? That wouldn't make sense. Dont you need a cycle of higher highs ascending upwards? I could be totally wrong but just saying bear market is over because the price went above what you thought was the low at the time ain't right. You need spike in volume too .
@_date: 2019-01-19 01:49:27
If only 2 people want to use your altcoins I would say its pretty damn worthless
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:28:48
Takes a lot of patience to be a hodlers. If people just try hodl during the tuff times i  think they will be rewarded for their patience.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:05:44
Yea I set the cache to 3gigs. I dont think my laptop has SSD just a terabyte hard drive. I'm putting the blockchain on a 500 gigabyte  external harddrive so that might be another thing slowing it down.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:10:10
Now that's what I'm talking about, a man of action.�� I hope its works good for you brother mine does I love it.✌
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:33:57
Maybe but I'm telling you when bitcoin makes its final drop to go through capitulation phase a lot of these altcoins wont survive.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:06:59
I think it's mostly my processor. Guy I know on here downloaded his in 1 day with a i7 processor.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:40:00
Yea I hope so.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:29:47
You should try it.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:18:13
True dat.
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:12:53
Yes it is. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:12:40
Hundreds of altcoins have already died in 2018 as the result of bitcoin bear market.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:39:47
Guess it dont much matter now I'm at 99% done.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:46:57
What is it then fool
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:33:35
2017 takes the longest. I noticed mine started to go faster in 2018. Probably because of bear market less people using it therefore less transactions to confirm.  Lol
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:34:00
This dude knows his shit.
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:43:36
Thank you I thought that was the way it was.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:38:59
Bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV will be dead by next year, and I wont shed one single tear��, couldn't happen to two nicer people, Roger Verr and Craig Wright. The 2 biggest swindlers in crypto. May their projects rest in peace......������
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:19:22
Lol true.��
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:02:57
I meant to say laptop harddrive computers
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:18:48
Hey maybe I didn't get in in the early days but you could say that about a lot of people. Maybe I even fomo in. That's the way a lot of people enter the market. The fact is iv learned a lot along the journey. I could have panicked and sold my stake
But I didn't. I educated myself about the space now I'm running my own bitcoin node By the way I never expected to get rich. Brother everybody was a noob at some point although i dont consider myself one now. Iv been in for more then a year. I dont pass judgment on noobs. It not where the journey begins it's where it ends and what you learned along the way. So their hope you learned something...✌
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:17:21
Yea probably was I didn't have a stake in bitcoin then.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:34:38
Lol I mean your right, nobody really knows what the catalist might be that propels bitcoin out of bear market. Maybe the first country to declare bitcoin a tax free currency in their country could do it. Who know�� I think it just has to run its course.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:03:00
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:56:57
I'll try it and let you know but when it was running on the default number it was slowef then it is now.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:15:49
You got that right.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:18:45
 that's how I figure.
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:57:19
Man I sure do hope so. Couldn't happen to a  better person. I hope they take all his bitcoin crash.. I mean cash.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:02:28
r/btc. Is that defacto subreddit for bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:38:52
Makes sense. I'll get back to you with the info.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:17:47
 read the news.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:50:44
Lol no could be cause installing on external hard drive.
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:14:47
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:35:28
No definatly that is not a bullish reversal . A bullish reversal must be confirmed by a spike in volume. The price needs to go above important resistance.  That's the way I understand it. I'm not a TA guy but that's the way I understand it.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:16:11
Me to!
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:32:31
Yea that's possible but who really knows were all guessing even the experts. Lol
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:56:58
Yes 2013 to 2015 bear market.
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:32:52
Thanks I'll check it out.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:15:05
Nov 2013 to Jan 2015 lasted 410 days.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:03:15
Sure is
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:42:03
I agree that they had to withdrawl. I dont understand what your trying to say.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:44:13
Intel core i3 CPU@ 2.20GHz 2.20ghz  x64 based processor installed RAM 4.00GB with one terabyte hard drive. I have to mention I'm installing block chain on external hard drive. So that could be the bottleneck. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:09:22
Yea that must be it. It should take days not weeks
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:47:48
Do hard drive computers have SSD? I'm not completely up to speed on everything about xomputers.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:17:35
Smart man.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:18:40
Maybe I did but this was widely reported on news not from one article but from several, It's a sad day if in America we have to fact check every article we read in the news. Half the time people dont believe the facts when they are fact checked they want to make up their own facts, not to say you do that, you know what I'm saying.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:18:57
Damn really why is the publish date 2019?
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:55:12
Yep did early this morning.  Thanks for your help
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:41:31
You can leave on the app and sell back to square cash for market value and it will go right back in your checking account.
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:57:43
No problem bro. I didn't even know about it till today.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:33:43
Smart man  
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:33:08
No they died completely 
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:47:31
Well put.
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:42:54
Damn really. Wonder what's taking mine so long.
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:48:53
I hope he sues him for all he's worth . ����
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:03:09
Yea it's crazy I dont know why it's taking weeks should be only days.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:27:31
Yea that's true. I was speaker of the shut down effecting the market in terms of delaying things like ETFs Bakkt stuff that could effect the price,possibly. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:52:44
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:42:52
It will still be the longest correction in history by next week.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:00:41
Well I was assuming that the news media would have looked at the data before putting out such a story. I mean it's not like it's just one outlit putting this out its several. Should I believe the crypto news organizations who report on crypto daily or should I believe it's not the longest bear market because somebody says so on social media like reddit.
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:34:26
Yea that's what some other people said. I dont know what problem is with mine.
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:24:57
That's cool as shit. I might do one myself
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:34:31
Electrum and MyCelium are both good wallets. You could download blockchain and use bitcoincore wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:05:37
A lot of these altcoins ain't gonna be around next year. I hope they are one of them.
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:00:27
Yea that is true does require some third party trust.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:40:34
Should I disable some apps that run on start up.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:25:03
Oh I see somebody just put it on there channel in 2019. Well I guess some people might not have seen it like me. Iv heard of him but never seen this video. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:49:31
Actually I'm not sure. I'm installing on drive F on external hard drive. Could be part of bottleneck. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:10:32
Yea I think it is up the verification threads and the gigabytes in the cache. I have a high speed internet conection.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:31:35
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:06:07
Yea I think he does have a big stack of btc. If he was so confident in his stupid altcoin he would have converted it to bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:47:09
Finally finished! Thank you for all comments trying to help figure out why so slow. You guys rock. ����
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:46:02
I'm installing blockchain on external hard drive could have something to do with bottle neck.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:00:16
People just want to see this swindler get what's coming to him. Karma a bitch.
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:53:02
What your speaking of is a small correction. These happen all the time in markets. A true bullish reversal must be confirmed by certain TA signs. I'm not a huge TA fan but I do think it give you a idea about what is likely to happen in markets.
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:41:42
Never tested it. I'm am downloading it on a external harddrive I wonder if that would slow it down?
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:16:00
Not all of them are worthless but a lot of them are.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:53:23
The bear market then didn't officially start until 2014 it lasted 420 days
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:35:40
I did that all ready up to 3 gigs
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:36:06
It did help some
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:03:52
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:39:53
Wo their my friend. No need to cus at me. Here is the article  cus them not me.
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:46:42
True it is a small sample, but this is what this guy does. He's been doing it for 20 years so I hope he is right.
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:58:11
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:06:07
I see your point. I'm just saying this is how the TA guys have been doing it. If I'm wrong one of them is welcome to set the record straight. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:07:50
I think they are going by market cap in news article.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:25:28
Yea I dont think my laptop has ssd
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:00:31
Only thing I know about harddrive it's a Maxone usb3
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:39:12
Lol i knew it!��������
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:10:39
Took week and half to down load block chain on my core3 proccessor.
@_date: 2019-01-26 04:00:17
Yea hopefully not. But possible.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:19:39
What's ZB platform account
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:32:20
Got it publish date made me think it was new.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:25:01
If your still hodling then you survived it.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:37:45
No but cpu usage is going as low as 5% now. Is that good?
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:33:57
That's when I joined reddit.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:01:46
I did check the cpu% it was fluctuating between 10% and 30%.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:34:43
Go find your bridge and crawl back under it! TROLL����
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:23:29
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:58:03
Their altcoins and their dead aren't they!?
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:26:57
YEA!! Oh wait it might not be over...����.
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:57:42
Lol you mean your bitcoin SV?
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:59:39
I did that it did help some. I increased to 3 gigabytes.  I'm done now though.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:54:27
Yea their problem some where I should have been done in a matter of days too.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:20:18
Yea i like the privacy coins too. I hodl some monero.
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:58:37
Yea I do have that wallet but it would be hard for a average person that knows nothing about bitcoin to use.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:22:31
I'm a little slow you got to break it down for me.������lol.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:23:12
They have your email right. They can identify by that depending on wchich one it is.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:45:54
4 gigabytes I think
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:59:08
I3-8130U CPU
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:30:26
Ain't that the way greenaddress spv is set up? Its dual custodiialship of your private keys. I could be totally wrong though.
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:16:55
Its gonna be a wild ride!
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:24:18
I'm going by market cap number.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:22:25
You can withdrawl to your personel wallet. Has to be at least $50 worth.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:02:47
@_date: 2018-11-08 02:00:12
Really? Just type it in the app.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:47:32
On 3
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:19:14
I think by second half of this year could see reversal.  Depending on what Trump does with this government shutdown. If if shuts it down again.in 3 weeks might extend bear market. imo
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:21:03
This shows up when I try to get to screen with core wallet. I'm in the process of downloading the blockchain.  Whould it be safe to restart computer or whould I lose a lot progress on the blockchain?
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:00:17
No correction you are right started end of 2013.
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:49:48
Not everybody bitcoin needs to be seamless in the future if it's going to be adopted by the masses. It has to be so seamless that people dont have to think about it when they use it.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:33:04
Until their is a bullish reversal we are still in a bear market.... and I'm the one who has to wake up.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:58:20
What was your CPU type?
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:39:07
Hard to say with crypto because of such a small sample. Compared to the regular markets. Really though patterns should be the same because human psychology determines market cycles.
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:07:07
Definitely 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:40:51
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:26:12
That's true but market cycles will usually repeat themselves over and over. Look at the stock market cycles have been repeating for years.
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:34:59
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:06:59
Lol yea let them
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:37:49
Nope you can withdrawl them to your personal wallet as soon as you get them if you want to. I cant believe how many people dont know about this. This is going to be a tool for mass adoption of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-08 02:54:21
Cool i didnt know that. So Joe Rogan supports bitcoin, thats cool sometimes i watch his podcast. Hes good comentator on ufc too.

Super low. Nowhere near high as coinbase
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:04:42
I hate to tell you buddy but your precious bitcoin cas is highly centralized, it would be easy not easy but more likely for some minor group to pull off double spend attack. I'm sure in the white paper it said something about bitcoin being a decentralized peer to peer payment system. Just face it bitcoin cash is a cheap knock off copy cat of bitcoin, and not a very good copy cat. Its destined for the altcoin grave yard. Hopefully your little brother bitcoin SV goes with it...
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:06:12
I know you never said it was the longest bear market. I never said you did.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:17:32
You should be ok it sounds more like a local bitcoins type of site then an exchange. Where does the coinbase thing come in. I thought you were seding from a coinbase account. You should be ok. I would still use a vpn so your ISP doesnt see what your doing.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:35:57
So with your definition the bear market ended when bitcoin  went above the lowest price point last month not when we see a bullish reversal? Guess we will have to agree to disagree.  It's been fun talking with you brother thanks.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:30:25
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:52:51
I know right.
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:45:42
No shit sherlock. I was asking if anyone had this problem before. Last time I checked this was bitcoin subreddit. Coinbase is a crypto exchange that you can buy bitcoin on right? Iv already contacted their support. Always a smart ass wanting to chime in.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:25:42
Don't let price drop shake you out. That's what smart money wants you to do. Then the smart money goes in and buys up all the weak hands bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:00:05
Still way early. Some of the custodial wallets are pretty good. You have to trust third party though. As far as running lightening on your own node still to early.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:24:58
How do you buy your bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:39:37
Never mind it was the authenticator app was out of sync. Everything good now. Thanks for the advice though.
@_date: 2019-09-14 09:11:27
That's great but I have an android. I got it working. It was the authenticator app its self that got out of sync. Everything good now.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:13:02
Thanks brother I'll try that.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:21:57
Hey bro if you don't mind me asking how do you do that without being able to log in?
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:34:52
Hilarious I love it!
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:02:14
Best custodial wallet is wallet of Satoshi .
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:40:24
BTC Dont get those other alt coins with Bitcoin in their name. There hard forks off of bitcoin but no wheir close to being the real deal.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:09:09
I don't want a custodial wallet. I was just answering the guys question about lightening wallets.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:39:24
That was bakkt wallet. They lunch there custodial solutions today. Imo.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:07:43
Maybe maybe not.
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:41:01
Why. It's just proving what everybody all ready knows Roger Verr is a scam artist.
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:00:56
Oh I think we all know Roger.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:47:12
Probably cause their buying OTC maybe.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:43:57
No because bitcoin has only been around for 10 years. They are the new kid on the block. Gold has been around for 1000 years or more. For them to respond to bitcoin commercials saying dump gold buy bitcoin. I mean come on man. Think a bout it gold 7 trillion dollar market cap. Bitcoin 100 billion dollar market cap. You tell me who is scared.
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:11:22
I have this app makes buying bitcoin easy as pie
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:41:02
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:18:03
Although it is early I disagree. If you buy bitcoin at a reasonable price I believe it is a good store of value right now. Any asset that always puts in higher lows every year is a good store of value. Might not be as good a store of value as gold but a better store of value then  the fiat dollar.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:04:56
I dont know but it would not surprise me. They depend on miners more then they do fullnode wich is what keeps bitcoin decentralized.  That's why bitcoin didn't want the larger block size I believe.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:34:35
Either then or definitely by the 2024 halving.
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:33:44
We need slow steady growth in price.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:32:00
Believe me if they were not  worried and they thought of bitcoin as a fad that would fade away somehow they would have never responded in a tweet to the grayscale commercials.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:35:06
Some of these whales just started buying in 2018.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:54:22
They want to keep this price low so they buy OTC then they can keep buying at the lower prices without affecting the price, I guess sounds logical anyway. Lol
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:42:53
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:18:09
Will be big for bitcoin and crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:26:58
I dont want to be accused of spreading fake news lol. ����
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:34:10
Yea its pretty awsome
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:55:55
Fees are a little cheaper then coinbase too.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:31:21
Karma whore, I dont get it?
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:46:47
No doubt. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:44:20
If i believed for a second that bitcoin was going to 0 i would sell all my bitcoin and get out of this market. Bitcoin is not going to 0!! If it does ill eat my dick and post it on reddit. �� Dont loose one single not sleep over it. A message to people bitcoin aint going to 0.....a lot of those shitty altcoins will though!
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:47:50
For me it was way easier doing cash app. Took 2min
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:03:33
I can tell you have thought about this in great detail and you are a very intelligent person. Gold, bitcoin and fiat will exist together for a while. Eventually fiat, I believe  will be destroyed from it being abuse by the banks that control it and the fact that it is not sound money. I believe gold will always be around as a store of value. I think bitcoin should continue to improve and not believe any other coin will over take them. So eventually I see a world with bitcoin and gold fiat gone, maybe even bitcoin and a gold backed crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:06:10
Yea it could be, could also be a purchase.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:52:34
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:27:21
Yes it is much much easier.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:25:51
Got it. Did all countries ban credit cards. You can still buy with atm card on apps like cash app.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:32:52
When you click on the website go to upper right corner click on menu then click on bitcoin rich list. It will show you some of the richest bitcoin wallet addresses in the world. The first five wallets are exchanges.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:51:48
Yea it would but now I heard it ain't true.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:51:22
I'll be damed! You dont know what to believe nowadays. Guess I was spreading fake news. Lol������
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:16:21
This is possible big news for mass adoption. I left out the fact about possibly coming out with crypto wallets. If they filed for the patents then they will more then likely do it imho.
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:32:13
It's his old buddy Roger.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:42:13
Comon man wake up. Do you think all these whales would be loading up on bitcoin and ethereum if the price was gonna go lower and stay their forever. You sell now your guaranteed to loose your money. You got to be patient this has happend in bitcoin before. This is way markets work all markets.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:06:57
Did they?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:42:09
No it dont only if you buy from an exchange or brokerage.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:54:26
Just go to options and click o withdrawl. If you want to withdrawl option you have to give them picture of license front and back and a selfie.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:05:59
Lol probably bulltrap it will go back down.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:36:14
Now that's what I call mass adoption. Awsome give your kids my best. Tell to keep up the good work.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:00:18
Yea that's I'm saying I got a coinbase account to and sqare cash app. Nothing stopping newbies from fomo with those things.
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:17:12
Its bitcoins richest list for good sake.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:57:32
OTC probably they buy direct from miners I think.
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:09:29
I knew if we broke 3650 4k wasn't far behind. Maybe bulltrap?
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:54:57
I dont think it really matters because we know theirs only going to be 21 million bitcoins mined. Nothing will change that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:30:47
Thats right no need to panic.��
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:02:59
You can you click withdrawl and there is a place to enter your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:08:29
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:29:31
I do agree with that but the futures stired up a lot of fomo which contributed to the sky high price pump which was a unhealthy price bounce. Which led to a massive correction. It does get more people involved in the space which is a good thing. Its basically  the same thing traders do when they short bitcoin. When you take outt a  future that bets bitcoin will be at a lower price your shorting it right? I dont know a lot about trading or futures i like to hodl. Im not worried about price to much. A lot of infrastructure is being built up to handle instatutional investers. So i know bitcoin is not going anywhere and will be worth more then i paid for it 5 or 10 years from now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:18:25
Thats right.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:51:41
Point being they are smart money. When all the dumb money panics from the price going down and starts panic selling they are buying because they understand how markets work.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:45:58
You dont really could be transfers from other wallets but more likely to be purchases. Imo
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:51:18
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:23:17
Look at the amount of bitcoin in the wallet and the amounts some of them bought. Some of them bought 500 bitcoins at one transaction to their bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:47:03
Like it did nothing for the price of gold after it was passed. Like futures did nothing for bitcoin when price went to 20k soon after in 2017. I think you could be wrong, but like i said we shall see.
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:45:59
I agree but with bitcoin that's nothing time wont cure.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:56:02
2500 is a super undervalued price for bitcoin. I would definatly buy more at that price. ��
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:25:14
Yea I might have left out that part. If they filed the patents and Yahoo news put it out their then it sounds like they will do it. imo
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:38:01
Much more.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:11:26
I think they buy a large amount when they are starting up and then recycle them when traders make trades.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:06:23
That was a mistake imo.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:45:01
Turn this crash into the best thing that ever happened to you financially. LOAD UP ON AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AFFORD!!����
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:42:08
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:44:55
You didn't sell some when the price shot up in 2017 and take some profits?
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:57:15
Ok got it thank you for your comment i learned more about shorting bitcoin. Trading seems a little to risky unless your willing to take the time to learn market analysis or pay somebody to do it for you. Ill just keep buying what i can afford and leave it to my daughter. Hopefully it will be the main currency when she grows up and replace this fiat currency. PEACE✌✌
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:14:03
That's right and I believe believe bitcoin will have a market cap close to gold by 2021.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:18:25
We shall see.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:03:05
You should get square cash app. All you need is your bank card. You can get your bitcoin instantly.   You can withdrawl to your personal  wallet too.
