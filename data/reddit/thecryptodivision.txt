Its not FUD if its true.

Exactly sell when you need the money or it will change your life. 
Saying never is a ridiculous stupid statement. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:58:00
Right....

Deflation isn't going to help with that. You realize inflation isn't just caused due to an increase in monetary supply, right? That's a very small portion of it.

There's little point in arguing with economically illiterate people. They don't even have the background in most cases to understand. They think it's really an opinion.

Why would this make you want to purchase bitcoin? You realize most people aren't anarchists and think the state is necessary... meaning if the statement is true, most people will be against purchasing bitcoin...

So far, according to the meme Bitcoin is between the internet and cellphones... Sadly, as time goes on we'll only lose time. 
And blockchain has been around, in theory, since 1991... And basically, it's never been picked up for anything except currency. 
I'm hopeful that crypto will change the world. But, people just don't care. People have government backed dollars and people in first world countries won't likely move to this insanely volatile asset without a major crisis, a major monetary crisis. 
And you're trying to market this to those exact people. The majority of third world countries that need this currency don't have access to it. It's a sad state of affairs in most of those countries. I just generally, feel Bitcoin will always remain a niche asset. Going for "a global financial system" is.... Ambitious at best, and delusional at the worst.

The fact is we can do all of those things... nothing crypto provides is any real benefit. The biggest thing crypto gives us is the ability to transact freely across national boundaries for a minimal fee. And I bet even that will stop once chain analysis becomes bigger.

Why don’t you use coinbase pro? You get cheaper rates
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:45:50
Just because I’m of an opposite opinion? Right... you clearly get the whole idea behind crypto ;)

This is a bad idea actually. The rise of central banks has been objectively a benefit to society. We had more recessions and generally more severe recessions during the free banking period of the United States. The only reasonable argument for “killing” central banks is because our purchasing power has generally decreased, but that doesn’t mean we are worse off actually. As the cost of goods has decreased and our total compensation has kept up with productivity, we’re actually better off than our ancestors ever were. Fewer recessions, more, better jobs, and less hard jobs too.

Why would you do such a horrible thing to your family?! Like what.

It could still be a scam. Enron hit 90 dollars a share and had a capitalization of 60 billion at the height. About half (give or take) what crypto is currently. 
Frankly, its not a scam but if you dont understand it, it can easily seem like a scam. 
Thats particuarlly true if you are a hardcore centralization believer. Its easier to accept if you dont think government or a strong centralized authority needs to be present in exchanges. Some people will fear bitcoin just because they can't move past the decentralization aspect. 
Want a scam? Go look up how the fed and banks make money.

Ironically my normal stock investments are doing better than my crypto right now. Granted I did just add 4 new coins last night when my limit buys were triggered. 
Stocks portfolio up 20.20% 
Crypto portfolio up 15.56%

Ah so it's not the blocksize limit then. Weird. I have seen this comment being thrown around in support of a blocksize increase.

I can't wait until companies start releasing crypto mining rigs but with GPUs. They need to ramp up production! 
I'm not a crypto miner but i'd love to upgrade my gaming pc but I cant right now :/ can't afford it. 
Well... I could afford it but its either buy a GPU to game with or buy crypto to hopefully better my future... And I decided to buy crypto!

Good. I Have always thought its a stupid word.

A guy almost commited suicide in a japanese exchange a few days ago... Is that not blood? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:08:47
For your sake I hope youre lying. Dealing with basically any business got much more challenging for you. But I do wish you luck! That's pretty bold.

The jokes on you! He never gives them his address and amazon just gets free bitcoin! Creating more adoption!

While he's right that the fees even with lightning are lower for bcash than Bitcoin. They have narrowed by a huge margin.
