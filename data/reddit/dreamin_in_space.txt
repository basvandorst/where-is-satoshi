There's no way that's going to work lol

What features do you think that Visual Studio Code has that full Visual Studio does not?

Are there really this many people involved in bitcoin that don't know how traditional investing tactics like shorts, calls, and margins work?

Perhaps if they can make it a Chrome (or FF/edge) addon.
I really don't want to replace my web browser when what I'm really doing is replacing my adblocker with monetization for content creators. I have my browser finely tuned, and I imagine most power users do as well.

I already use BitInstant to buy bitcoins with cash, which can use MoneyGram transactions. What reason do I have to switch to your company?
Edit: Especially since you charge 5.29%, whereas BitInstant charges 4%.
