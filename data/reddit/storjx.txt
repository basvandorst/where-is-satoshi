It does exist, check our GitHub repository if you have the chance. Work in progress but well underway. Also you can try  until we are ready for a public release.

Storj doesn't believe in competition between different project but in collaboration and integration. We are in touch with all the mentioned projects. Each one of these projects tries to solve a different problem so for true decentralization (not only for cloud storage) there needs to be cooperation between all these very good ideas. Storj itself tries to be as modular as possible so it can be adapted to work with other parties.

Development is well underway, you can check the latest Storj News at this link:  on Sunday you can join us on IRC and watch the live Hangout stream for more updates.

We appreciate the support!

Storjcoin X (SJCX) is a token to purchase and rent storage on our platform. SJCX is a Counterparty asset that uses the Bitcoin blockchain for its transactions, a token, not an altcoin with its own blockchain.
It also allows us to raise funds through crowdsales to support the project, development, community, etc. The main way I personally see Bitcoin, as a currency, being involved with Storj is most people will use it to purchase SJCX.

These are only tests, no coins are being earned at the moment!
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:35:20
If you guys make that happen for 2 countries I'm sure many more will follow suit!

Our reward system will be automatically actioned by the network. A user uploads data to the network and the Farmer gets a reward when passes the challenges (heartbeats) to make sure the file shards are actually being hosted. Storj won't have any control on the payment mechanism once it is enabled. For the moment we are running a beta test which doesn't include rewards. The next stage (Test Group B) will have rewards enabled.

Feel free to continue on our forum at  you are invited to join the discussion there. Everyone is. If there is confusion about something we will gladly try and help.

I can guarantee you that SJCX is our final token for Storj. MaidSafe may have SafeCoin as a temporary measure until they have their own blockchain, but don't really know much about their project. Storj isn't a coin, it's a drive sharing technology. It happens to have chosen to create Storjcoin X, a Counterparty asset. First and foremost it is so that Storj can raise more money in the future to continue development and to pay early farmers for contribution to testing the system. We don't have our own blockchain because we don't need it, as raraymon mentioned we are bootstrapping with Florincoin after trying with Datacoin first. This will get us up and running and will then integrate Factom when we need to scale up.

Interview starts at 1:08.

We have actually just released a FAQ to help with questions people may have about our project. Feel free to have a look: 
@_date: 2014-10-18 04:01:29
A great opportunity to catch up with development progress and ask all your questions about Storj! We will post the link to the Google Hangout stream this Sunday.
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:58:45
We thank our friends at Factom for the video and looking forward to integrate when both projects are up and running and ready to scale up. 
This video is a good example of how different projects can be used by leveraging their APIs for a common goal! Cooperation and integration is the way to go!
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:47:49
You can download it from MetaDisk, no extra plugins required ;-)
 
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:27:09
More than Storj's reward system being implemented in a sidechain I see people building their own apps, tools, front-ends and use our storage as a back-end through our APIs. They can then choose the payment option they prefer and even a sidechain for their own systems while for the storage they still use Storj's rewards. A bit like Dropbox charges a premium for an 'added value' service on top of the Amazon S3 storage used for their customer's data. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:46:21
It's a great idea, even at Storj we are thinking of using Factom to store metadata for our network, it will also be useful for our Groups of Verification Nodes, it will allow us to scale our network up when needed while keeping data on the blockchain to a minimum.
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:52:03
This is why we choose heavy use of the blockchain in Storj. Using Factom's methods we can do near realtime auditing on a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-19 03:29:43
We are looking forward to it too and are hard at work to go live as soon as we possibly can!

CLOUD STORAGE is another service that will become "decentralized" soon. Storj ( is a decentralized cloud storage platform that offers security, privacy, cost savings, and robustness over the traditional cloud. It also allows average users to contribute their hard drive space and other resources to the network. 
The team is hard at work developing a peer-to-peer network, a platform and apps that will allow anyone to build their own app, service or tool via our API while using the Storj network for their storage needs. The 2 main component are MetaDisk, a web app, and DriveShare our client app.
MetaDisk is an encrypted file sharing and storage web application. It uses a blockchain to sync file state in the network in a trust-less way. For more info go to  or to try out the beta   
Users with spare storage on their hard drives could share it with the network using the DriveShare app ( DriveShare is an application that allows users (farmers) to sell their extra hard drive space for cryptocurrency. It uses a variety of algorithms so that farmers can cryptographically prove that they are holding a particular file. Users are then rewarded for holding and transferring the file to other peers.
Our API will allow developers with the right skill set to develop on top of the Storj platform. More info at

I see more and more use cases for Factom, keep them coming guys! Factom is definitely a 2.0 project to watch closely in 2015. We at Storj were looking at it when it was still called Notary Chains. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-19 03:27:36
DriveShare will be very easy to setup, we will release binaries for all major OSs, you can have a sneak peek of the GUI here:  it is really a couple of clicks to get running. And if headless there will be CLI versions too.
Bandwidth is very important too, 700Kb/s is not great but I believe that every little helps to support the Storj network and allow it to scale up. You can find out more about Raspberry Pi here:  Farming Rig advice here:  Upload Bandwidth here:

Dear all, Nic here - Storj Community VP, the article was published by Coins Source on their own initiative. I do post most articles I find about Storj as well as our video and audio interviews as soon as I spot them. I do try to promote Storj to be honest, but what is said in the articles I link is not written by us unless otherwise specified.

Wow, really cool visualization of the blockchain! And I like the stopwatch to see when was the last block! Compliments! 
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:40:46
Thanks for the support! I do like Open Bazaar too. 2015 should be a very interesting year with a number of projects set to go live!

Thanks for sharing, looking forward to find out more about this project. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:28:01
We are in touch with Factom and that video gives you an idea on how different open-source projects who seek to solve different issues can work together. Thanks for sharing it ;)

Here is the Storj whitepaper just in case:

@_date: 2015-03-31 21:28:46
Just wanted to wish good luck to the Factom team for their Factoid Software Sale. At Storj we look forward to progress with our respective development ad see how both technologies can be put to work together. There are certainly many use cases for Storj + Factom.
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:26:55
Thanks for clarifying! 
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:21:49
Hey Shawn good to see you. We have been talking about Factom at Storj for a long time. Looking forward to see how these two projects could benefit from each other's tech. Factom makes record keeping easy and transparent. Storj could allow for data, documents, certificates, media, etc to be stored in a safe, decentralized, and private manner. We don't believe in competition but in collaboration. There are lot of projects that are supposed to launch this year and each one is good at fixing one problem, there are some very good ideas out there. There isn't a project that can do it all and I'd love to see them integrate with each other. 2015 will be a year to remember!
