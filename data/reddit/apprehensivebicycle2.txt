Hey OP, people here aren’t totally anti-exchange. Exchanges are necessary for most buyers. However, when you buy from Robinhood, you’re literally not buying anything. You’re buying numbers on a computer screen. When you buy real bitcoin, it’s a rewarding experience. You hold something real...even if it’s digital. I would never pay money for bitcoin that’s not actually bitcoin. You’re not transacting on the bitcoin blockchain, so what’s the point?

Buy BTC. If any of this ever catches on from an institutional level, or if governments ever buy it, it will only ever be Bitcoin. No one aside from crypto nerds have ever heard of bitcoin cash, and they never will. The bitcoin branding has had a hard enough time earning respect in 10 years. Nothing else will accomplish it anytime soon.

Not a terrible argument at all. I agree with this sentiment 100%.

I’m a liberal (albeit a moderate one), and I love bitcoin. However, I grew up on punk rock and I think it’s suited to that fuck everyone mood I get in sometimes. I live in LA and all of my friends are liberals and NOT ONE of them likes bitcoin. It’s funny to me that liberals say conservatives are sheep who follow Fox News and Breitbart etc....because they follow their media blindly too. If CNN or NYT or one of those shitty liberal sites was big on bitcoin and related it to “occupy Wall Street” every liberal would suddenly love it. Very very few people in this world think for themselves. They do what they’re told. And currently, most media is anti-bitcoin.

Ponzi scheme = you can’t get your money out when you want. With bitcoin, you have full control of your decisions at every moment.

Good luck to you. It’s a humbling thing, this market. But it’s important to get good at them. If (IF) bitcoin ever breaks out into the six figures, and the price was fluctuating 10k a day, we’d all be massively unprepared were it not for these moments. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 18:46:07
I disagree. There’s no reason to think Bitcoin can’t get better as it goes, and become the superior technology as it evolves. Also, its appeal will be the trust it’s developed over 10 years, then 20, then 30, etc. If you want big money (investors, custodial services, nations, etc), they need to trust the system. Any new technology starting out will always have the trust factor working against it. Bitcoin has a massive head start in that department. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:58:38
As adoption grows, so does technology and application. We have no idea what custodial services may exist if this thing really takes off.

Eh. Not really true. I’ve seen dozens of people, maximalists included, calling for ranges of 3k-4500 in the past few months before it started. $1,000 makes little sense to me. The demand at that price would be so huge that it couldn’t possibly hold at that level for more than a couple hours.

@_date: 2018-11-19 19:18:01
The too volatile argument is nonsense. If you use it as a currency, it’s not volatile in the exact moment you’re using it. If I buy a T-shirt from you for $10 equivalent in bitcoin, at that moment I’m paying you exactly $10. I know what the current relative value is in that moment...Who gives a shit what happens 5 minutes from now. Maybe it goes up after that, maybe it goes down. I could instantly replace my bitcoin wallet with $10 fiat if I so wanted, further negating the “volatility” factor. That pizza story everyone discusses is an absolute fallacy. At the moment that dude purchased those pizzas, he did so with a reasonable equivalent of bitcoin. He did not do so with 60 million dollars worth of bitcoin.

Any writer who says “then it will go to zero” isn’t really worth reading. Bitcoin simply can’t go to zero. It never will get even close to that. Even if it reverts back to self-mining and is traded between collectors, it could actually survive that way for years, until interest regenerates. And interest probably would regenerate. Some group or country would decide to adopt it and then the building of the ecosystem would start all over again. I don’t think bitcoin will ever die or be replaced. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:22:13
Never gonna go that low. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:21:43
Appreciate your post! Just my two cents: Bitcoin won’t ever die. That’s the beautiful thing about it. Even if it keeps crashing and everyone gets sick of it, it will just return to a (slightly larger) version of what it was in the early days. There may not be mining farms but people will keep mining. People will keep holding. People will keep transacting it amongst themselves. And someday the interest will regenerate. It might even play out the exact cycle we’re in. It might repeat ad infinitum. I’m 41. If I live to be 90, I truly believe bitcoin will be around and be used by many people. It’s a solid structure that has survived for 10 years and will continue to survive. And I, for one, am happy to be one of its users. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:53:15
Yes. But you could see the same market as the one we’re in now (or a worse one) forever. If there’s only &lt;x&gt; # of holders — less of a # than 21 million — bitcoin could just be bought and sold and traded forever at a low price like now, or even much lower. The odds are that, over time, there will be enough holders to make bitcoin more scarce and drive the price up...but there’s no guarantee of that happening. Even after 10 years, it’s clear that there aren’t millions of people willing to hold these. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:30:46
Makes perfect sense. Oh, aside from that part where governments in Iran and North Korea and all our other enemies could currently get their hands on huge chunks of this money if they wanted to. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:04:37
Make the decision for yourself. But I think there’s more long term upside than downside. Even if it goes to 3k or 2500, it’s not difficult to imagine it recovering to this level, if not more (and possibly substantially more). 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:14:29

I have a friend who is a hedge fund manager. When I started buying stocks, he told me: “just remember, the same people who buy and sell stocks are the same people who used to burn witches at the stake”.

Those guys are not idiots, no. But they have skin in the game. They have jobs and reputations at stake. It behooves them to talk negatively of something like crypto because its success could hurt them financially or professionally. It’s why all change is hard and takes an enormous amount of time, because you’re trying to overthrow old methods of thought and money-making. Let’s see how long it takes for self driving cars to actually be implemented. We all agree there are benefits and advantages to self-driving cars. If all the powers that be jumped on the tech, it would take very little time at all. But that’s a threat to oil markets, to stalwart car manufacturers, etc. They try and kill it and kill it until they have to throw in the towel and join it. I think that’s what will happen eventually with bitcoin. I think you’ll get a major player to say “you know what? It’s proven itself”. And that’s when enormous leaps will happen in its value.

“What can you do with a BTC?” 
The energy expended to mine a coin can potentially save someone’s savings from falling prey to a failing national bank, an inept government, a devaluing currency - use cases that we are starting to see around the world. The fact that the bitcoin was mined is the precise thing that gives it more trust and structure than something created out of thin air.

Holding is not only a reasonable strategy, as evidenced by history....it’s also vital that many people do hold when an asset slides into a bear market. If every holder sold, there’d be no foundational floor and the price would plummet way lower than what we’ve seen. Holders get shit on, but they’re actually performing a function that keeps the whole thing intact.
