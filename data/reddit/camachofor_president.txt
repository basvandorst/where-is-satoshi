Sorry, was not my intention to come off as impolite.
But as qriticue to your plan: please consider writing down the seeds and store it in a safe place. If you do not have access to one safe place, consider writing the seeds down (but in wrong sequence) on one piece of paper, and then write the correct sequence on another piece of paper. Store these in different safe locations.
For example: store one of the parts in a bank box (if you have access to one), and make a lawyer store the other one.
Consider educating someone around you how to restore from these seeds (in case something happens to you).
If you do these steps (in addition to your brain wallet), your chances of being able to use your coins in x years will be higher, IMHO.

No problem! You mnemonic words can be imported into any compatible hardware or software wallet. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:34:49
You obviously don't understand how they work. You start by getting the 12/18/24 words that make up your private key. Write down these words, and it doesn't matter if you accidentally put your hardware wallet in the washing machine. Just restore from your mnemonic words and you're good to go again! :) 
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:11:16
I would recommend to read up on hardware wallets. Of the potential problems you list, the only thing you must take care of is to keep your mnemonic words safe. They are the keys to you bitcoins.

One way is to have two papers stored in different places.
