Woot getting my first trezor tomoz ... gonna just test it satoshi by satoshi in-and-out until comfortable, before becoming a Hodl Hermit.

TL,DR; I couldn't keep track of one thing so I now keep track of many!

Why not honour the Japanese origins further?  Less than 10K Satoshi is a pittance, so why not count using Japanese forms (万 for 10k, so 10万 is 100k, 100万 is 1M, etc)?

I'm expecting something similar - we're going to face a global economic collapse where national economies are too broken to wage war, or an actual war.
The dreaded third option is we get the war first, *then* the collapse.

I foresee fiat remaining, but only in a local context.
The average pleb won't deal with bitcoin any more than they deal with 6-figure sums of cash - they will never see that much in their account unless they've just taken a loan to buy a house.
Bricks and mortar in bitcoin, milk and bread in fiat.  A coin for the wealthy and a coin for the not.  These dreams of fiscal equality are nonsense.

True - I wouldn't hestitagte.

Ha wow.  Used to live in Croydon back in the 90s.  Which centre had the dinosaur on the roof of the elevator?
And I'm getting mad vibes of those stairs.  This isn't near where Laserzone is / (was back then)?
