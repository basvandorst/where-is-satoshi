What software do you use 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:16:34
I always recommend that with any investment, you need to have at least a two year time horizon. If it's less than that, the money is best to put in the bank.

I bought mine a few months ago and try to wear it to places I know will be heavy foot traffic. I get a lot of questions about it so as long as you're willing to talk to people, it's pretty cool. I got mine at The Bitcoin Store.

And I replied with my info. Let me know if you didn't get it.

Don't be a hater, be a lover. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:39:13
Questions have all been inquisitive. How do I buy some, how do I make money, why is this better than investing. The hardest thing for me is to ELI5 after being immersed in this for a few months. Tips?

Nope I actually manage money for a living. Just want us BTCers to be able to get the word out as much as we can and if that means helping others find gear, I'd gladly pass along the website.

Not sure what you mean. I've got a day job that takes all of my time/energy and pays me in fiat, but I bought this cause it was the only one I could find where you can put your own QR code on it. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:52:34
The Bitcoin Store
 
You can have your own QR code put on it, pretty sweet!

Guess we found our allthingsdecentral reddit rep! How about some swag for pimping your gear!
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:38:20
Very cool. The more we spread the word, the more people will look into it. Since this is truly a supply and demand story, more demand will lift the limited-supply price and we will all win. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:56:54
Nope not at all. There is a particular feel to the decal but no issues for me in the gym, then again I'm not usually a sweater from lifting.

If you go to their website and look under men's or women's apparel, you'll see the shirt. If you click on the shirt, there's a box to put whatever public wallet address you'd like. Cut and paste one from your wallet (the receiving address ��) then purchase! $35 plus shipping and a few weeks, and you'll have your swag. Message me if you need more help. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:55:24
Yep or advertise publicly and receive donations from those generous brethren showing appreciation for your advertising, which DOES happen (from my experience).

Ha ha, love it! Then I guess you can consider what I'm doing as spreading my seed.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:32:47
Hahaha nope. Education does not equal financial advice, per DOL. Take my word on this!
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:45:58
Couldn't tell you. The confirm email when I purchased came from The Bitcoin Store and the shipping emails came from allthingsdecentral.com. All I know is I got my shirt about 10 days later and the QR code matches one of my wallets, so I was satisfied. Good quality shirt too!

Thanks we gotta keep the good mojo going despite the negative news lately from China. I'd rather people hear all of the benefits rather than "Bitcoin crashing because of..."
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:38:40
You don't get it. This is bullish for the established cryptos. Less opportunity to diversify means more investment into the big ones. Plus, if you read the article between the lines, the SEC is in essence validating the block chain as a viable technology by not going after BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:18:29
Actually it's the exact opposite. This creates additional barriers to entering the crypto market which means less competition. The established big boys will see increased investment, especially the ones with finite availability, like BTC.

I'm currently using poloniex and Gemini. I've tried twice to move coins from polo getting "Complete:Error" messages both times (only attempted it with .00000001 + fee) so I'm wary to attempt that again, especially with the terrible support with my tickets still "being processed." So I'm kind of in limbo here. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:28:41
And this is precisely why it WONT have a big crash. Ever heard of the market climbs a wall of worry?
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:11:30
I did the minimum to cover the fee plus 0.00000001, plus the system let it through and pended it. Then a few minutes later, it goes into "Completed:Error" status. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:33:27
TBH, their fees are higher than any other options I've used. Having said that, they have been the most upfront about the situation than any other option I use and I feel comfortable keeping my coins in my wallet. I understand they may not award BCC since they plan to not support it, but at the end of the day, I am more concerned about the safety of my BTC than I am being awarded BCC.

Thanks man. Appreciate the advice.
