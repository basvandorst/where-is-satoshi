From what I understand, there is an active bitcoin group here in Dallas so getting the word out to them would help. However, I don't expect to increase sales accepting bitcoin... yet

Awesomeness! Thanks :)

Thank you. That's sounds easy.
So the things we need to set up is:
1) Wallet
2) Bitpay.com (link from 
3) Get the word out we accept bitcoin!
Am I missing anything else?

A financial analyst in this [CNBC article]( said:
*"But I don't see it as a store of value, because any [other cryptocurrency platform] could come out with a slightly better technology and completely replace bitcoin."*
This is why he is wrong: 
Once an industry rallies behind a technology, it's the winner (even if there are other superior products). It is a common phenomena in technology, especially with first movers. Bitcoin is becoming the standard.

Thank you for discovering this!! It's been corrected... 
...though we'd still be happy to accept $1,110.

We probably do. We're a good size operation.
Let me know if you ever need maid service. I'll give you the Reddit discount.

They still get paid by dollars. It's a nice thought one day I might be paying them in bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a CIA conspiracy.
