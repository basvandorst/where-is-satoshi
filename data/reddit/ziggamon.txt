That is a trick question. 
Truth is there's a number of privately owned TV channels in all kinds of countries, and there's a bunch of countries with free press too, even if you want to exclude the US.
I guess it comes down to getting paid for the TV production and that's where it gets messy, because you know that the reason the Russians are paying him is not because of their great love for libertarian ideals.

Now we've figured out their business model!
 
If each of their 10.000 merchants expects to be storing up to €1000 at any given time (average it to be 500), that means that each new merchant signed up is cashflow-equivalent to them earning 500 euros.
Assume they keep the money in bitcoin (they might as well take the currency risk) and it's actually not a bad a business model.

The 100.000 users they state comes from 100.000 addresses used on average every day. So no special user counting scheme other than the flawed assumption that 1 address involved in a transaction would somehow equal 1 active user.

@_date: 2014-12-28 20:17:53
You're right, I was quick on the judgement. On the other hand likely it's just a division by a constant, the average number of outputs spent per transaction.
Still, the interesting metric IMHO would be how many users _own_ bitcoin at any given moment, which should be higher to some extent. Perhaps one could try to see all addresses that own more than say 1 USD worth of BTC, and then apply some type of method for guessing which addresses belong to the same wallet. 
If you have relevant links on other ways of estimating things I'd be very interested :)

Tumbling being combining with other bitcoin? Then you'd go from 100 bitcoin 100% stolen to 400 bitcoin 25% stolen?
I don't expect anyone checking, but if some people did it would make it somewhat more difficult to deal with stolen BTC. If at some point major cash exchanges started looking at those bitcoins it would definitely lower incentives for theft.
Same as many people wouldn't want to buy stolen goods on craigslist, many wouldn't want to accept stolen bitcoin. Just airing the idea here anyways, thx for feedback!

I'm sure you've improved and I wish you nothing but success. 
And if this issue and similars are fixed then that's great. I'm not referring to signup flow, but rather to what IMO should never happen from a service provider: shutting off service before warning about it first. Bitpay did that when we hit some regulatory boundary, admittedly customer service was very helpful and quick so "only" 6 hours of downtime, but a warning email would have been more than enough. "Hey, you hit your limit, please do xyz steps within 7 days or service will have to stop for legal reasons". Shutting off service should IMO be the absolutely last resort.

There's really not much more we can do but wait and we're very sorry about this. We deal with old-fashioned services and every once in a while these issues happen, and sometimes it does take more than 24 hours to get a response.

Circle Internet Financial Ltd., one of the most heavily-funded digital currency startups, will no longer offer customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoins.
The move, disclosed by the company Wednesday, is the latest indication that the financial revolution that bitcoin’s early developers had hoped to spark isn't playing out as planned.
Bitcoin remains a closely watched virtual currency, and its value is rising rapidly. But it is still a niche product, often traded by speculators and investors who own it as a hedge against traditional government-backed currencies.
Meanwhile, bitcoin’s underlying technology, blockchain, is widely being studied in the financial services industry as a possible tool to make everyday banking and complex financial processes faster and easier.
Circle, backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and venture-capital firms such as Breyer Capital and General Catalyst, says it will continue to use blockchain as a way to expand its fast-growing international payments business, which it hopes to integrate peer-to-peer money transfers into text, email and other digital messages.
The company’s mobile app, called Circle Pay, makes transfers in dollars, euros and pounds. Jeremy Allaire, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, says Circle remains committed to using blockchain, to facilitate money movements between individuals and across borders. The company plans to continue using bitcoin and other digital tokens behind the scenes to settle transactions in traditional currencies.
“Our vision has never been, let’s adopt a new currency,” said Mr. Allaire. He he said that bitcoin hasn’t evolved quickly enough to support everyday financial activities. “We want to realize overall consumer benefits without having to be a bitcoin buying-and-selling exchange.”
Circle says its blockchain-aided payments in traditional currencies have been growing multiple times as fast as its bitcoin payments.
“The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,” Mr. Allaire said of bitcoin. “We’ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.”
Circle’s announcement comes less than a week after a federal court ruled that the Internal Revenue Service could serve digital-currency startup Coinbase with a summons seeking detailed information on customer transactions. Coinbase, which hasn’t been charged with any wrongdoing, said it would fight the “government’s sweeping request.”
Circle, which said it hadn’t received a similar letter, will partner with Coinbase for Circle customers who want to continue to buy and sell bitcoin. The price of bitcoin has risen in recent weeks, with some investors using it as a hedge against inflation, like gold.
This week, Circle also said it plans to release free software code, known as Circle Spark, that can be used by digital payments providers to meet various rules including anti-money-laundering regulations when transferring money via the blockchain. Circle believes that using blockchains is cheaper and faster than traditional rails, like bank transfers or card networks.
By releasing its software to the public, the company hopes to spur a global network of banks and fintech firms to use the blockchain to help move money across borders, and integrate payments with chatting and other digital activities. That could help Circle to emerge as a major competitor to payment apps like PayPal Holdings Inc’s Venmo or Zelle, a soon-to-be-released app operated by a network of big banks. Circle is initially partnering with apps in South Korea and the Philippines.
Circle is still small relative to Venmo and the banks, who are doing tens of billions of annual person-to-person mobile payments. Circle is on track for over $1 billion in transfers this year, and it is growing quickly. Its cross-currency transfers have grown 300% in the past six months.
Circle’s bitcoin volume, meanwhile, grew just 50% a year.

@_date: 2016-12-13 13:39:50
Maybe turnaround is the wrong word, but that's not what's important. What I meant is that the growth is not in "bitcoin for consumer payments" as was originally thought, but "bitcoin for payouts". I.e. "bitcoin out" instead of "bitcoin in". 
That's all I was observing on.

Not really true, 51% doesn't get to change rules of bitcoin, they can at most make double spends of transactions. Making changes to the rules is a totally different thing. It's called consensus for a reason.

If SegWit is enabled through UASF, but the soft fork is "voluntary", i.e. miners do not need to mine SegWit block if the dont esnt to: would miners thus be able to keep mining old-style blocks and use ASICBoost?

Looks very useful at first glance! Hoping it would be enough to separate exchange from wallet, and to do for example coinbase-to-bitpay type transactions. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:09:13
Right now signaling is to see whether there is overwhelming consensus. If in advance of the event major players (the exchanges, wallets and other merchants) are not in public agreement then the UASF would not go through. You're right though that we're trying to solve the Byzantine problem here, and thus using a somewhat Sybil resistant measure - using verifiable communication from reputable economic actors. 
Re "yes, but what if it all goes crazy anyway" - Presumably we would know that pretty quickly, and the way I understand it (correct me if wrong), if it does happen in the end then what would happen would be a chain reorganization. There is a small risk that we'd get some transactions doublespent but likely most transactions would just end up in the mempool and also be mined on the "other" side of the chain. Importantly the reorg would arrive in something that is still bitcoin, the same chain, either with this change or not. This while risky is _far_ less risky than any of the hard fork proposals that we've seen.

Bitrefill CEO here.
In this case there's no "multi-platform" support, it's just address generation. Our intern (albeit a very talented one) implemented it, in a to him new environment. It's really not a big thing, if I remember correctly the making segwit addresses was a couple of lines of code, somewhat clunky but doable with bitcoinjs (we published a gist somewhere). Some more work to implement our custom spending logic but hardly insurmountable in a day.
In any case, SegWit was announced far ahead of time. IMO if fees are crippling one's service the one should implement a relatively simple fix that would save X0% of costs. We did, and it paid off pretty quickly, not taking into account secondary effects of conserving shared resources.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:42:24
I would guess 15% of a given country [using] bitcoin with some regularity.
If it's payments, and the US that means 50M people, so probably at least 100x from now. Still quite far away.

I would disagree. It's also Monday afternoon in China. Timing coincided perfectly with the fee adjustment, and the rate at which these tx appeared makes me think they could have been pre-generated. 
Also - these transactions keep coming, so whoever screwed up seems to keep doing it.

Thanks for reviewing!
Why emails: There are many reasons to get an email address. The main one being refunds - sometimes transactions don't go through for technical reasons and we need to be able to contact users. We used to have an email-free option but it was too much hassle dealing with refunds when they needed to happen. Also in some countries refills are delivered as a code that you have to type in your self, you know * etc, which also gets delivered by email. Privacy conscious users can always register an anonymous email somewhere, which is fine. 
High fees: Yes they're often high. It's not us overcharging but the aggregators. We're working hard on getting better deals and lowering our prices in more countries. See for example this news abt India:

Plz look at my profile and rating before downvoting: (not trolling)
Every word of that headline highly misleading in so many ways it's ridiculous:
1: "100.000 merchants" - No, it's the number of vendors that _could_ accept bitcoin because their payment solution is integrated with Bitpay. Haven't necessarily enabled it
2: "Bitcoin passes" - Most merchants accept fiat cash via Bitpay, which is _very_ different from them holding (i.e. using) bitcoin. 
3: It implies people use Bitcoin for commerce. Honestly do you know anyone that bought bitcoin for the purpose of legal e-commerce? It's currency speculation ideology and drugs at this pint. 
4: Look at transactions per day and ask yourself if the number adds up with 100.000 merchants and millions of users. 
I think bitcoin is amazing and am spending my life working on Bitcoin projects. But let's not kid ourselves with this stuff, it's a mirage.

Hey, thanks for using Bitrefill :)
Re your question: Yes, Bitpay reuses addresses. It's a bit unclear why they do, but they do. That is not a problem. But very strange that you got that notification in the window.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:29:59
It's repeated every time because your argument is wrong. 
Bitcoin has more value if more people accept that it has value. That's it. If people let themselves be convinced to use some weird scheme behind the scenes as long as they get paid in cash - that's something else entirely. 
And the merchant adoption things is largely a sham. It's used only when prices are overrated (because people are selling bitcoin). Otherwise, in a normal western economy, it makes zero sense for a bitcoiner to spend their bitcoin (other than ideological reasons of course). Using bitcoin for e-commerce has no advantages, only downsides, and the biggest one is: Bitcoin is hard to get in the first place, so will take effort to "replace" for the believers. There's a reason why Bitpay report how many merchants and not how many transactions they process every day (hint: not all that many).
I'm not saying it's completely worthless that merchants are integrating with Bitpay, I think it's great for many reasons! But it's misleading to use that title because those companies don't use bitcoin and most of them don't even know it exists. 
There is a real bitcoin economy. Where bitcoin is used for its unique strengths and features. It's really interesting and different in many ways. But online merchants is not part of it. 
EDIT: Oh, I forgot. "Bitcoin's value is tied to being able to spend it at places" is wrong for the same reason that gold has value and you can't spend it in many places.
