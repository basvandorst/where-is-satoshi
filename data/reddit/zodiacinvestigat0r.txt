Bitcoin is "antinationalism". Money is a medium used to perform exchanges, and a good money works in as many exchanges as possible. This means of course that it cannot be restricted to any "nation", and the concept of nation in a sound money such as Bitcoin do not exist.
What one could do is using different terms in different countries for certain amount of Bitcoins. In Scotland, 0.1 Bitcoin could be called one Pound Stirling, and one Satoshi could be one Wallace. This is how countries used to under the gold standard.

Ok, now you're talking about that FRB "isn't likely" to happen with Bitcoin for several reasons. I agree with you on that, maybe not for the reasons you stated, but that is something quite different from your original statement. You seem quite clever so I believe that you see the distinction between the more hardcore "Bitcoin can't be an IOU"-position in your original post and you're more moderate "FRB isn't likely to happen with bitcoin" in this reply.
While we're on the topic, is there any particular reasons why bitcoins won't be used in FRB? Yes, I believe so. Not because, as you stated, "you can manage bitcoin yourself." You can manage your gold by yourself. That's not a problem. You hide it somewhere and make sure to defend yourself from getting robbed, just as the fact is with Bitcoin. Defending it from criminals is probably as easy as defending your Bitcoin from "private" criminals.
But Bitcoins strength is that it is quite easy to protect from "official" criminals, AKA government. Bitcoins physical character makes it possible for you to store your Bitcoin in your brain, which makes it much harder for the government to gain access to your Bitcoin. And because of this it will be very hard for the state sanctioned-FRB system to survive in a Bitcoinmoney-world.

They don't. Atleast when you don't lie about what it is. FRBs always describe themselves as deposit banks, which they clearly are not. You CANNOT get your money back, if someone has already claimed it before you did. Try running an FRB and be honest with the fact that they will loose all of their money if 5% of the customers decide to withdraw their funds.

I think that the network right now is very vulnerable, but the point of a decentralized network is that anyone can connect. Anyone can help to make sure that Bitcoin continues to stay as a sound money. In the future I think that we will see clashes between big companies investing in mining equipment to make sure that the states can't doublespend, or we will go back to cryptocurrencies that can only be mined with GPU/CPUs.

Why is this even important? The great austrian economist Ludwig von Mises showed that hoarding is of course no danger to a money, since prices will simply adjust accordingly. If we try to adapt ourselves to the arguments put forward by the enemies of Bitcoin, they will win.

No, it is not. In Sweden, where I live, it is illegal to download from Thepiratebay. Despite this, about 2 million people (roughly 20% of population) does it. Why do they do it? Because it is convenient. And the police can't do anything about it, because the convenience caused the number of users to skyrocket, and the masses are to overwhelming for the government to do anything.
Bitcoin challenges the monopoly on the production of money, one of the states most important monopoly. Are you really so naive that you think that they would give it away just for fun?

I am sorry, but you are wrong. Money is necessary to every society. Without the use of money man would still remain as a primitive creature. There would be almost no cooperation at all, and the trade would certainly be very limited. The only goal of man would be to find enough food and water to survive.
With the use of Bitcoin our society can advance to the next stage of civilization. Fiat does not live up to the standards required by a global world.
The use of Bitcoin as a currency is currently the most important function of Bitcoin and despite talks about "Bitcoin being a platform", I cannot imagine a more important role than smoothing the exchanges in an exchange based economy.

There are two main kind of banking:
1. Loan banking
2. Deposit banking
With loan banking, which is extremly important for the economy and I believe that is the one you refer to, you lend money to people and demand that they pay you back even more in the future. This help allocate resources to their most valuable use.
Deposit banking is you depositing something and your bank promise you that you will have it back whenever you want it.
Fractional Reserve Banking is a mixture of loan banking and deposit banking and it is extremly unstable, due to the fact that the one who withdraws their money first are guaranteed to keep it, thus creating a "run". The history of Fractional Reserve Banking is a history of bank failures.

I dont believe that Dorian had retired in 1999.
So Satoshi was an active member of the cryptography community as early as 1999, and worked on Bitcoin for ten years, but was not aware of the work of Nick Szabo until Wei Dai told him in 2008?
Even though I must agree that the post in it self is very very close to the Bitcoin technology, I find it unlikely that it was posted by Satoshi.

I am sorry, but you are wrong. Fractional Reserve Banking (what you're calling debtmoney) is possible with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is ofcourse a platform, but one of the most important function of the Bitcoinprotocoll will be bitcoin the currency. Bitcoin will revolutionize money. But if you think that due to the fact that Bitcoin is new, nothing written about money in the past can teach you anything about Bitcoin, think again.

I bought Bitcoin because I believe that it will be the most acceptable medium of exchange soon, money. I have bought services with it but not as much as I own so i guess you could say that i speculate on it. Online privacy is very important. In six months Bitcoin will be approximately where it is today, with some more services accepting it. Hopefully we will have more of our own infrastructure concering infrastructure, use, accesibility built up more to that point. 
The prise will be around 1500$, is my guess.
