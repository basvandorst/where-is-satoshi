Yeah obviously he was joking with the Cybercash and Webdollaz hence the hashtag but hopefully he wasn't about bitcoin.

I wonder if he had any information regarding any of his private keys stored on his email account. 
I checked GMX TOS and it doesn't say anything about accounts being automatically closed after a certain amount of time inactive. It does say that they are able to close your account for any or no reason.

At 7-11  Huh Wow that is huge. 
Western Union should be shitting itself right about now. And if they aren't , they should be. Their (...20, 30 year?) golden goose is about to get cooked.

See the latter half of my signature.  Additionally, 'rising asset values' is also not the definition of a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. 
Oil becomes increasingly difficult for drilling companies to obtain as the decades go by. Is oil a Ponzi scheme? 
Also, "The guys who created bitcoin" don't own or create all new Bitcoins - they are created and distributed, essentially, in proportion to the amount of computing power contributed to the network, and anyone can contribute.

I think this is OK. Adoption can be slow from the general public, there's a strong enough community now to keep it going and allow the general public to join as they want to. It also gives us more time to accumulate some more BTC, right?

It may depend on how they implement the system. If it automatically converts to fiat, then it's not a good news in the short term. For bitcoin to work, everyone needs to accept bitcoin, e.g. You can pay your suppliers with bitcoin,  people take bitcoin as a part of their salary. Paypal could very well make or break bitcoin, depending on the public adoption.

It was pretty good. I caught it on TV and have been telling people to watch it on the iplayer for a good intro. I'm really looking forward to that feature length Dark Webb documentary that is in development right now

every 5 or 10BTC ... use a new wallet.
i do this.
when you pay ... seller don't know if you have more than 5 or 10 BTC.

I do not know enough about NFC to challenge your assertion of security. However I'll reiterate that there is a huge market for credit card fraud, which may or may not prey upon this technology (now or) in the future and thereby expose Helios. What NFC chip do you use? The only details I found were: Same as Visa/MasterCard and produced by NXP.

Bitcoin could pose threat to financial stability as opposed to fiat which is usually always the source of financial instability when they devalue the currency by printing billions of it at will? They're obviously fearful of it.

That's interesting and all but what does it have to do with bitcoin?  Cheesy It is alarming how much value the dollar has lost though and people dont realize it.

As a result - bad article.
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:32:20
Definitely a milestone for bitcoin, really happy to see so many great things happening and so much good news coming through involving bitcoin and it seems to be happening a lot more often now as well which surely is a great sign?
@_date: 2014-08-29 08:19:39
I don't think it will be able to completely replace fiat, but it may one day reach the same acceptance level as fiat and be considered as another kind of money by general public.

Finney sounds great, we still need to make people understand how to use BTC tho.

If bitcoin does live to its promise, I can easily see how this will give Ebay a run for its money.  Instead of a Ebay for each country with lots of fees, it will be a one world online market.  This could be as big as Amazon or Wikipedia

Has already been posted but can't seem to find the thread now. Maybe it got moved to the Press section.

I would change two things:
1 Lower fees to allow micro payments 
2 Faster transaction times

There are paper wallets currently people can print and use seals but I wouldn't accept them like fiat, you would need a way that they were printed and don't let the printer see the private key, which would be impossible. I just don't see a solution but it would be nice.

Apple has a pretty large userbase so I am sure that future is very bright for bitcoins.

You could argue are any laws legitimate. Yes, AML and KYC laws are legit and betraying them will likely end you up in prison.
