"But I got it for free" scenario...
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:59:28
Exactly. I don't fucking need Amazon to accept bitcoin. As much as love bitcoin, my credit card is more convenient and They can take it in their own time. Really, bitcoin isn't ready to for companies like Amazon to take it on. Bitcoin needs gentle adoption. If a big company takes it on too early and then pulls out at the first sign of trouble it'll be crippling. As for this Reddit, every day we hear of some new shitty website that is taking bitcoin like it's a big deal but most of the time it's just someone trying sell junk memorabilia. I know we have to start somewhere but things will roll along in their own time. I don't expect it to change here though...

Although users will complain about a many things (they always will)... If the basic functionality is there and does the basic job reasonably well then the UI is the most important thing, without a doubt. So many new users won't even give it a chance if it doesn't look clean, professional and slick. There will always be a niche of people who don't care for this kind of thing but the majority falls to aesthetically pleasing design.
I've had Mycellium on my phone for around 6 months I think but I don't think I've sent more than two transactions in and out of it. Andreas Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet just ended up being the one I ended up using and it's not really had any major faults. Frankly I don't use that either as I've not had any need for a bitcoin wallet on my mobile though (yet!).

And then tax evading... You need to be very careful with volume if you start cycling money from bank to bitcoin and back to the bank with tons of cash.

Fair enough... You got 3 accounts right off the bat though? Just be be sure that you're headed in the right direction and you really want to mine... It's pretty boring and can quite easily turn the game into your second job, just to pay the 'rent'.

Once they upgrade their UI, they might stand a chance.

The flaw in my argument is that I don't know how much the protocol can be altered. I know it can be altered a fair amount... But some things are meant to be set in stone (eg... 21 million coins).
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:36:33
Fair enough. The two block one is more like an infinity symbol and a bit squarer. Half the guys thing it looks like that weird S though.

I can't help but compare Bitcoin to the introduction of other new technologies. It's easy to be hopeful and compare it to the introduction and growth of the internet. However... What if you compare it to the introduction of the fax machine that, at the time, was hailed as an amazing breakthrough in communication. Every office had to have one till, of course, it was overtaken by the introduction of email. 
I'm confident that this will not be the case for a while, but people were just as confident about the fantastic fax machine. It is still possible that bitcoin has a serious flaw or could be overtaken by something that it can not simply upgrade to match.
What if a protocol is introduced, that has no risk of a 51% attack, for example? Down to what level can bitcoin's protocol be adapted?

Real or not, people need to remember that if you lose all your money, it's not the end of the world. Losing all your money to something like this is a perfect reason to declare bankruptcy and then you can get back on your feet and find a job and get back out there.
Why people would gamble so much on gox at any time since they closed cash withdrawls, however, I will never know. Warnings were given.

As a designer, I like it. I haven't seen it before. It says 'infinite', 'chain' and looks strong to me to me. I see the cube idea easy enough too. 
It does, however, look a little bit like an '8' perhaps. If there were 3 blocks there then perhaps people wouldn't say it looks like "that S" (that I don't remember seeing personally) too. The logo also looks slightly squashed; try using regular hexagons.
Now as for convincing everyone on the internet... Good luck. :P You'd certainly need more different options than just one. Reading some of the other comments here, I think people want rather too much from a logo. I think summarising the name is enough. Actually being a descriptor for how the thing works is far too much. But then again... Maybe it *does* need something more complex? I don't think it needs side chains and little 0s and 1s though, hah.

**An alternative:** 
Could be just black too, when needed, of course...
I tried making it as bold as possible. You can't go much bolder than this and still be able to make them look like they're hooking around each other and stacking at the same time.

I always thought the UI for this wallet was pretty bad... But it seems that the guys behind it are just a bit too far out. It's definitely a "different" ad, but it's still awful.

I'm kinda on the fence with this. It's a shitty situation but you can kinda understand the troubles of modding a 12 mil subscriber sub. What they really need is a new sub for something like 'techpolitics'... I'm not about to look but it'd make sense to have one purely for basic tech news and one for controversial topics. People interested in what the NSA is up to might not give a shit about the latest phones and visa versa. I'm sure there are subs for this already, they probably just need users.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:17:16
I see. Lack of numbers? The entry level from the first course is quite high.

Good analysis in your post there; nice to have someone lay it all out and make it even more blindingly obvious than it was for anyone who was still not sure.
