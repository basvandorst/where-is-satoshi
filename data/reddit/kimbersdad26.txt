No problem. I really enjoyed his book. It basically just talks about how to educate yourself financially and what he did to make money. I think the best thing about his book is him explaining how just because you’re a doctor or a lawyer or an astronaut doesn’t mean you’re rich. Having a great job doesn’t mean anything if you mishandle money. He explains that poor people have no assets or liabilities (I.E. cars, houses etc), the middle class has liabilities, which is basically debt, and the rich have assets. If you work for your money, you have a job. If your money works for you, you have an asset. And then he explains why owning a corporation is so important. His book opened my eyes to some mistakes I was making and now I’m correcting them. In fact that’s why I’m investing in bitcoin and Ethereum. These coins are an asset, although they’re extremely risky. So I’m investing small amounts into them and investing more into real estate etc

Ok why doesn’t the damn stop loss ever work? Every time I set a stop and most of the time a limit, it never works. I lost a lot of money over the night because I trusted the stop loss. It’s like I have to manually monitor this shit 24/7. What’s the deal? Anyone else experience this?

Actually he filed bankruptcy to avoid being sued for 24 million dollars. He still had 80 million dollars in off shore trust funds but because they’re off shore legally the US can’t touch it. If you read his book he even explains how rich people avoid being sued. He states rich people are rich because they don’t own money. And if your money is in a trust, you technically don’t own it. I would actually listen to the guy who just saved himself 24 million dollars. Remember poor people file bankruptcy to get rid of debt. Rich people file bankruptcy to hide and protect money.

No actually I made money and I never bought bitcoin. I just don’t see the point in gambling. Crypto is not investing, it’s gambling

What’s the point of bitcoin? What originally got me interested in bitcoin was it’s anonymity. But of course after much further research, you discover that bitcoin is not private. Buying and spending bitcoin can be traced back to you. So my question is what’s the point of bitcoin, besides decentralization? There seem to be other coins that would serve a better purpose such as Zcash. I want to buy and spend crypto without the government knowing anything about it. Everyone calls any coin that isn’t bitcoin “shitcoin” but there seems to be more coins that have better anonymity, faster speeds and and cheaper fees. So far the only thing keeping me bullish on bitcoin is its popularity. So how is bitcoin better than any other coins? 
Btw mods, I’m not trolling. It’s a serious question

Does this mean that I’ll be able to buy bitcoin and normal stocks from the same exchange? Cause not buying through crypto exchanges would be pretty cool. I buy stocks in everything so adding bitcoin to the same exchange would be convenient.

tO tHe mOoN bOyS. 
It’ll crash again. Get rich quick schemes almost never work and they never work twice. You won’t be millionaires by tomorrow or next month or in 20 years. The only thing going to the moon is your debt

Good idea. I can actually work overtime and make a pretty good killing. I just don’t know if I’ll make what I need to by then. My life changes drastically month to month

If bitcoin fails it will be solely moon boy’s fault. Name a get rich quick scheme that worked
