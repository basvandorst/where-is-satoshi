If you are buying with USD you need to care. You are paying a fee in USD the less you pay in fees the more Satoshis you can buy. Don't be dumb
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:40:13
Buying in $20 increments on coinbase is pretty dumb. You need to see a 7.5% increase just to cover fees. More if you include selling fees

You realize the comparison is in the bubble not underlying assets. Right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:36
Bubbles popping have more to do with demand than supply. The tech bubble, housing, tulips, beanie babies all pop because demand plummeted. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:50:58
Nope. The $100b in cash you are referring to is Berkshire Hathaway "cash" line on its balance sheet. It is not literally cash its assets that can be quickly converted to cash. They are earning interest on the balance. Also, "Cash is king" refers to cash flow to literal cash.

$ value is irrelevant. No one, at least no one with any common sense, holds a significant portion of their wealth in cash.

Quantum computing is accelerating. Crypto could be fucked
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:59:56
I might not be thinking about it correctly but AI should have no effect on crypto

My guess is progress in quantum computing.

So what is a bitcoinanaire? Somebody with one Bitcoin? I don't think u thought this through
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:26:33
As a buyer wouldn't you be worried that the seller could deny they got paid? I guess cash if just as bad (actually worse) but I feel like in this case a check would be best. What prevents someone from saying that wasn't my wallet? Not trying to knock it just trying to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:17:46
Sorry. I meant how does the buyer prove he paid YOU. Meaning, what stops a shady seller from claiming he was never paid? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:57:28
No one knows. But it's only $100, assuming this not a lot of money for you, just go for it.

I was making two different points. Hence the gap
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:35:30
Bitcoin to Apple is a completely arbitrary comparison. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:48:36
15-25% is ridiculous low. Part of the current price is assuming big banks will start putting money in and that more people will won't to to get in on the gains. If the wealthiest country in the world suddenly stopped allowing bitcoin trades the price would tank. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:47:23
The Gov't wouldn't need to to shut down the internet to cause a major price drop. All they would have to do is stop banks from investing in Bitcoin or sending your money to bitcoin exchanges. Sure there will be ways to get around the regulations but demand would plummet. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:26:48
Maybe focus on the road
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:17:13
Both of those examples have cash flows that dictate give them value. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:52:42
That is exactly my point. Your comment is redundant.

@_date: 2019-10-23 21:30:01
you might be right. However, if enough people believe quantum computing will hurt crypto quantum news will continue to drive prices down.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:34:37
You don't make money till you sell. Cashing in on that scale would cause and they could lose a ton. Much like what happened with mortgage backed securities 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:23:59
If all the coins can be traded in a single network what is left to differentiate them? What is left to make bitcoin (or any other coin) special / valuable?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:11:20
On $20 it is not nothing
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:37:56
With the small amount you have invested keeping it on coinbase is fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:40:53
You are crazy if you believe that the US making Bitcoin illegal wouldn't lead to a major crash. That said, I don't believe there is any chance the US would make Bitcoin illegal.

My personal rule is over $10k. it's not worth it to me to spend $60 -$200 on a hardware wallet if I have less than that. In the end it's a personal choice about your risk exposure. No matter how you hold your coins there are stories about people losing access holding them the same way. Security wise I would be comfortable with Coinbase holding even $100k (I don't have this much) but m concerned with how they handle forks etc.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:02:08
No one knows. Anyone who claims otherwise is a charlatan

Check your fees. You are probably down. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:21:35
The people trying to make money are what is driving the price up. The price increase comes from speculative investment not utility / adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:41:05
$4 transaction fee on a ~$65 = 6.2% that is massive. 
"in cleared in five hours. Not bad!" That is terrible.

People said the same thing about Bitcoin when it first came out
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:13:54
Blockchain is the future but no one has been able to convince me bitcoin is. There may be a fixed supply of Bitcoin but cryptocoins are infante
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:00:38
I don't think you understand bubbles. They increase in price, or "rise", till they pop. The increase in price does not prove anything. No one will know if we are in bubble or not till it is too late. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:29:03
"volatility that goes up is beneficial to everyone who uses bitcoin" Not true. If you pay your employees and suppliers in Bitcoins and there is a large spike it could be disastrous for your business.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:10:40
With it's current volatility I don't see how Bitcoin could work as an official currency. Imagine trying to run a business using only Bitcoin.     The price you charge would have to change constantly. How would salaries work?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:05:39
North Korea launching a rocket could disrupt the global internet and highlight the weakness of Bitcoin compared to gold
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:36:06
Except that is exactly how bubbles work. Price increases, more and more people want to jump in, price increases further, people put more than they can afford to lose, price dips a little, late investors panic and price plummets. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:00:58
How? People will have less $ to buy BTC and will need to sell BTC to pay debts and everyday items. Both factors decrease demand. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:34:15
"Go take an economics course, then buy bitcoin."
Haha find me an economics professor from a top 10 university that endorses crypto or views it more than an incredibly risky investment

 chartology is non sense

You don't know if it's is a bubble till it pops. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:40:06
Nope. Price is based on supply and demand. Math only limits supply. The demand side is based on nothing but the masses. Bitcoin could end up like AOL, Myspace. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:42:27
Read the original comment that you replied to. I've been saying that from the beginning.

Deflation is terrible for currency
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:41:25
of course it can. If a new tech comes out people can easily switch. You are insane if you think bitcoin is a sure thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:42:00
Putting more in less often means less fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:19:30

Once a bubble pops it is no longer a bubble. You fool.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:21:47
Gold investors have a VERY different investor profile than Bitcoin investors. Everyone I know who owns BTC has never owned and will never own gold. I do think / hope BTC is the new gold but not until the big money takes a larger stake. Also (a bit unrelated), remember gold has one major advantage over BTC; it doesn't depend on a network the gov't can shut down or can be attack during a global crisis 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:31:48
Bitcoin is not the technology though. blockchain is.

Your taken this way too literally
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:20:52
That is not how investing works. People did not all buy at the same price. People will sell to capture gains, prevent losses or seek higher returns elsewhere. I understand a lot of the HODL types wont sell no matter what but they are not the ones who drove the price to the current levels. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:16:45
And that's what concerns me about the price of Bitcoin. Maybe it's just this sub, but, it seems like it's all uneducated (at least in economics) investors inflating the price to an unsustainable level.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:44:12
This can be solved by the Blockchain without Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:32:49
Bitcoin is more like gold than a currency. It will never work as a currency because of it is deflationary and volatility. Imagine trying to run a business only using Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:11:39
This is what people said about housing. "It always goes up in the long run". The risk is people are starting to invest a large percentage of their $ in bitcoin or even borrowing to buy more which leads to an inflated price. If / when there is a global recession people will be forced to sell their coins, to pay for everyday expenses, driving prices down. This combined with less demand, due to a drop in discretionary income, could proliferate the price drop and cause a panic leading to a huge price drop. It could be very similar to what the events that led to the Great Depression. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:45:00
Your statement is correct for Blockchain not Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:57:36
What? It is super easy. I can switch to any alt coin in minutes and it would cost me next to nothing and transaction costs are reducing over time. Also, as you said, BTC is an investment. If the price stagnates and investors see another coin increasing they may sell BTC for the new coin. In an extreme, but very possible, case this would lead to a huge dip / crash. Driven by a self feeding loop of BTC sellers driving BTC down and this new coin up. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:23:15
If there is an attack on the global internet people may not be able to get their coins verified where gold will work as always. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:11:57
Global recession.

Patterns, more often than not, are imagined. look up gambler's fallacy. Also, the last part of your post almost literally states "this time it's different" which is known as one of the first surest signs of a bubble
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:55:35
Nope. "The increase in price does not prove anything. **No one will know if we are in bubble or not till it is too late.**" IDK if we are in a bubble or not and neither do you. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:06:49
I would be really interested if someone would do the hard analysis on this; but part of the reason I am bullish on Bitcoin is I feel like that, unlike gold, the average Joe is using it as a store of value where the long tail will drive up the price. If this turns out to be true recession will lead to price drops.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:18:35
THIS is why Bitcoin could be a bubble. Not sure how many people are doing stuff like this (I've definitely seen a few other posts like this) but if enough people are it could cause a serious crash.
