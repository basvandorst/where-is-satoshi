You miss the point : A lot of people are interested in making a fast tax free profit. They always were.

It's kind of sad. The idea behind the currency sound great. But it will probably failed due to greed.
You're right "Merchant" will determine the success, but "exchangers" will probably destroy it before Merchant have any chance to make it successful.
Just my opinion. I hope I'll be wrong.

You know already nobody will listen.
So you know bitcoin as a currency is already dead.
OK ? Now you have 2 or 3 choices:
1/You leave Bitcoin alone. You dont loose anything except any hope you could have about a currency free from the government.
2/You buy more bitcoin, cause it will raise like hell for an undetermined period of time.
3/You short-sell bitcoin, cause it will eventually go back the its "real" value of 0$.
Good luck.

So It's a bet: Either it work as a support for exchange on a great scale, and it's awesome. 
Or it doesn't really work, and it's just some investment with huge crash (and/or excessive raise) to come.
That pretty much confirm what I was thinking. It could be an awesome new currency, but it also could be a new tulip market. 
 And for now, It behave more like a tulip market.

Gold has valuable physical property. 
If tomorrow I launch a new currency called "CoinCoin" on the same model , the Bitcoin could disappear. Unlikely but you get my point.
