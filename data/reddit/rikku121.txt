Ugh, just like verge
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:03:36
Which exchanges do they get their price from? I mean they have a chart that spikes up and down like crazy
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:33:49
Of course you surely use it besides "hodling" it for reasons
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:37:20
Ugh that's stupid
@_date: 2019-07-25 05:16:03
How do we know those shorts aren't bitmex's and that they aren't fkng around with the market?
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:22:55
Now watch it go down and despair lol
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:35:37
Tell him that unless he buys your investment won't go up
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:11:27
What goes up ... tho
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:27:03
Ask yourself, is anybody "using" it? If the answer is no then a fair price is unknown and there's no real reason for it to hold ��
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:12:49
Went all in on 3.4k, so thanks :3

Delusion at its finest, it's slowly turning into vergearmy kind of delusion...
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:38:29
January 2018 disagrees
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:34:47
Theoretically sure, but a network of only two nodes is of no use to anyone so it's really just worthless.
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:37:16
Ouch, you surely don't mind those fees
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:26:59
Sell it and buy gold
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:16:01

@_date: 2019-07-17 22:33:41
Dude I invested 100BTC, I now own the entire country after only 48hs!!
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:29:23
Is there a Bitconnect "mainnet"?
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:29:24
Never heard his voice before, and how fkn annoying it is holy shit.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:08:42
Just hope is keeps going up for no reason and have the guts to sell higher. That's about it, you can't really use it for everyday stuff.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:10:24
Wasn't it supposed to be a peer to peer electronic cash system though?
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:39:59
Does yours sound like that too? Sorry
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:32:38
You're underestimating alts dude, there's lots of outdated blockchain crap and clones but also a couple legit ones putting real work into new technologies
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:13:38
The Bitcoin pitch keeps changing every year... it was never considered as "gold" until fees went off the roof during the 2017 hype lol
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:40:40
Just don't get hit too hard, you might forget where you left your kids college tuition.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:44:03
I don't think they're doing a mistake though, it's a solid choice out of all the alts honestly
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:45:09
Oh god, these posts won't stop...
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:16:36
Got like 6 into Bitcoin but 4 of them decided on IOTA lol
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:15:36
Still a horrible currency lol
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:20:59
I thought everyone was in it for the tech?
@_date: 2019-08-02 01:04:51

Five transactions a month? Dude that's like 10 bucks
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:12:13
It just goes up and nobody really knows why, cuz fuck fundamentals
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:05:30
What goes up ... tho
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:16:20
Isn't it though? Most people buy it cause it keeps going up without knowing why lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:24:35
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:44:08

@_date: 2019-06-17 21:47:59
