Still small but growing. There is a meetup, and we started a Baltimore Bitcoin Association which has meetings at different places throughout the city to show merchants that there are people that would like them to accept bitcoin.

Hey I was there. We went from congressman to congressman talking about bitcoin. They were all very receptive to the technology and had a lot of good questions. As a group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce hit up 435 offices, that's every office in congress!

Great talk at bitcoin in the beltway. Love that guy.

The other week I went out from business to business in my city to ask if they were interested in accepting bitcoin. The overwhelming majority knew nothing about it. The people who did just didn't see why they should offer it if no consumers are using it (chicken/egg problem). 
But there was definitely interest and possibility for growth. It's just gonna take time, but probably less time than you would think in hindsight

Couldn't we then just move to another coin? Then the same thing would have to be done. Repeat.

Or maybe he knows he needs to abide by regulations for circle, which is basically a hybrid between bank and btc, and this is a political move as well. Who knows, but this should be interesting/infuriating down the line. Businesses that conduct business only in btc don't really need to worry about regulation, but there have to be some that strive for that middle ground to provide exchange services.

But you don't need as many services just to secure bitcoin, so that will always be less than the current infrastructure with fiat. Besides miners, most of the services that run on bitcoin uses the internet, so basically whatever that uses now (which should get more efficient down the line as mesh networks start to take over).

Pretty sure merchant and consumer adoption are equal priorities. This all goes hand-in-hand. Both will grow together, it's just easier to get a merchant set up with bitcoin now than it is to get a consumer. 
However, those merchants are also consumers. So, if they can use their bitcoin to purchase things elsewhere, then that ecosystem naturally grows. Merchants also talk to a lot of other merchants.

Defeat him with logic. It's not a Ponzi scheme by definition.

Right, I don't think bitcoin ever had a cryptographic problem, it's more of a scalability problem, if that. But it's always been sound from a cryptographic standpoint. If sha256 isn't sound then we have more problems than just bitcoin!

Looks like they took it down, it originally said "i wish i could talk about this good news".. or something like that.

It's just a service on top of the dollar, like bitpay is a service on top of bitcoin. This could happen with bitcoin.

I feel like even the name Ben Lawsky is like an Elmer Fudd cartoon character trying to regulate bitcoin. Unfortunately,  the rest of the world won't have regulations like this and the USA will be left behind in innovation on the blockchain.

You also can't "back up" gold. With bitcoin I can put a paper wallet in my safe, store it in my trezor, give it to my parents to put in their safe, etc. I can have a gold bar that requires multiple signatures to spend it (without a 3rd party). I totally buy into the gold vs. bitcoin thing. Bitcoin has way more advantages.
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:10:31
[Bitsie Share]( does some of that, although not open source. I like the idea of something open source for an online shop, but coinbase also acts as a money transmitter and bitpay acts as a payment processor, which have regulations surrounding them.

ehhh, what is this article? Seems like something a spambot would write. And why would a government auction cause panic selling anyways? The fact that they are selling bitcoin gives the currency legitimacy and would make it go up in price if anything.

Is there a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow?

You're missing the point, which is to have Bitcoin be a common word that people hear on a day to day basis so that they get comfortable with it. Bitcoin is still new and there is a long way to go before there is mainstream adoption. We need more players in the space, more businesses and services that show the legitimacy of the technology.
I don't see anything wrong with asking companies to use bitcoin, the more people hear about bitcoin the more people will start to adopt it. I love going into a store/bar/restaurant and asking if they take bitcoin, it always starts a conversation and the more people hear that word, the more they will stop thinking it is just used to buy drugs online.
Sure there are a lot more aspects to Bitcoin than just using it to buy things in a store, but if you are a fan of Bitcoin I don't see why you wouldn't ask a company to use it just so they know that it exists and there are people that legitimately use it.

First off,thanks for keeping bitcoin free and setting the precedent for others doing the same. 
Not sure if you can answer all these, but im curious from a business perspective: How do you compensate for ach transaction fees? Is most your revenue generated from your premium packages? 
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:15:58
maybe i am misunderstanding what is being said, but doesn't it take a lot more energy to secure that much fiat money (the banks, the security, etc)?
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:51:59
It's a lot more energy efficient than the cost and energy of a fiat infrastructure.

You can buy bitcoin at circle.com for free and not have to wait 5 days for your coins. I think you get them immediately, depending on how many you are asking for.

I look at bitcoin like a rubberband, you pluck it and that first wave is the spike. Then, it crashes back down below where it was originally plucked. It repeats this over and over as it  increases in value overall. The next pluck will be bigger.
(I have no idea what i'm talking about)

my understanding is that ZeroCoin relies on Bitcoin (doesn't replace it) and just adds a layer of security. it gives you a 1-to-1 exchange with bitcoin. You can read up on it at [zerocoin.org](

I've been looking for a list like this. Is there a merchant list that I can view somewhere online? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:38:21
But that's the best part about these crypto-currencies. If one gets shut down, then you can just put up another. Also, I don't think it's exactly the same and competition is good. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:36:27
Does that make it bad? 10% of code being different can be a big thing? And yes, I am a coder.
