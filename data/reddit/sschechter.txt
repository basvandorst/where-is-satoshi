Being the shareholder of a company that owns an ASIC is not the same as owning an ASIC. They are under no obligation to share mining rewards with you just because you own their stock. We've come a long way from 'anyone with a computer.'

I don't follow your logic.  Can you please explain how this is a scam?

Google will be there tomorrow, I promise.  BitShares, in the worst case scenario, only enhances your resume.

DPOS does not require users to store their keys online.  Only delegates need to sign blocks. No need to 'prove' the size of your stake since dividend payments are burned ensuring all users percentage stake in the network increases.  The users number of shares don't go up, their percentage stake in the network does.

Voting occurs when a transaction is made (or you can just vote by making a transaction to yourself), so your keys will need to briefly come online. You do not need to keep a continuous connection in order to participate in the chance of receiving a reward.

And who will be able to afford an ASIC when the price of Bitcoin goes up x10?

A blockchain is just a data structure.  Why shouldn't there be more than one?  Thats like saying 'why should there be any other stores when we have Walmart?'

There can only be ONE religion.
There can only be ONE government.
There can only be ONE decentralized blockchain.

And you say bitshares like its its a negative thing. BitShares makes the most business sense of any 'coin' because economics are a fundamental part of the design, not an after thought.
