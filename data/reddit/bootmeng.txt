Very interesting! Would this legally work? I doubt there is legislation specific enough to say it wouldnt

When I first bought in in 2011 I was looking into buying anonymously. The service I used used money gram. I put in my information, went to CVS, used this special phone and followed instructions. This might work for you.

Not as much as you'd think, considering I'm on my way to the moon. Inertia does most of the work.

Sorry Uncle Donny, but there's no defending that one. Bitcoin has been one of the greatest trade deals in the history of trade deals, maybe ever. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. Believe me.

According to [blocklink]( you need a miimum of 15 bitcoins to be in the top 1%. People couple have been hodling for a while.

Oh he's a family friend. I was NOT seeking advice. I was just curious what he might say, knowing what he'd say, and I was right.

"it's not backed by anything!"

This has to be the highest upvoted comment in the sub. No, I didn't look yet.

I came here to break me off a piece of that!

He a family friend. His gf had let slip mid convo (and it was so obvious) that he did in fact have btc!

He immediately changed the subject. This was really just an exercise in seeing what he (as a professional) would say.
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:06:13
He said something like "gold really isn't backed by anything." In which case I responded with how gold has a finite amount, cost to mine, super conductor, high demand, etc." This was an exercise for me to just see what he'd respond with.

Keep that shit for r/politics or r/news or r/all or anywhere else on reddit. What does your comment even have to do with what you replied to?

I think it's important for a community with a purpose to stick to that purpose so that the integrity of that community is not diminished. There is an abundant supply of social media platforms that circle jerk this topic day in and day out. I come here knowing I won't be bombarded with political hate.

Has anyone thought maybe this is the (establishments) way of delegitimizing crypto?

Wait...IOUs? That sounds a lot like fiat paper money. Couldn't we have used a better analogy?

It's funny how people are so adamant about "past performance=\=future results" and that you can't predict the future price. And yet the same people say there's no way it's going to be 30k, 100k, 1mil, "anywhere". Let's just leave it as "I sure hope so. Let's see what happens."

Nah. Its actually this rogue planet half way across the galaxy. Its inhabitants mastered the bitcoin ages ago and have since hurled themsleves through the cosmos in order to get more gains. This is our destination...for now!
