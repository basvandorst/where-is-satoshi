What will make it a good currency is to upgrade the tech. But if every fork just gets siphoned off into an altcoin that’s gets sold off nothing’ll get anywhere

Nope. US

The commenter is right, hella people have to buy to maintain that high a price. It would have to become a globalized currency to get the kind of transaction volume that would allow mega-high prices

Not really. It’s a universal network that runs on the participation of its constituents, has a democratic system built in for network upgrades and is very censorship resistant. 
These are all very attractive traits that promote positive empowerment of individuals.

There is an urgent problem but everyone assumes someone else will take care of it so they don't bother doing anything 
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:13:22
But can you buy drugs with a bar of gold?? Heh got em that’s the real test for a currency

The block chain is too small. The point of Bitcoin xt was to increase the size so that there could be more bitcoins in circulation

it's a nice place

I typed that really quickly so I wasn't able to articulate very well. From what I've gathered the reason that this article was written is due to the turmoil in the Bitcoin world of regular Bitcoin vs XT. This article explains it pretty well:  
Link TLDR; block size limits are the reason why the number of Bitcoins in circulation is limited. This was intended to be removed but hasn't been. It's currently at 1mb, but Gavin wants to raise it, 8mb currently, hence the XT fork 
Edit: another good read:

A little abstract, Haven’t watched enough rick and Morty to get the joke
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:50:13
The fact that no one knows why the price is rising at the moment means this probably won't really go much of anywhere. I doubt it will beat the last big spike, especially since it's rising so fast atm.

Unless your grandma is dying of cancer then HODL until the sun burns out. We're all gonna be billionaires:,)

welp im convinced 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:47:35
Doesn’t take a lot of money to bid the price up. If people start to sell ofc, price crash, won’t be able to get that much money out

it is unstable, but it is unstable in the good direction. Although I think its true that most people forget Mt. Gox was the major contributor to the 2013 flash crash
