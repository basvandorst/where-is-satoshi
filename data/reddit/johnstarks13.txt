They got *loans* from the government, in a regulated way, to stay afloat, which they have since paid back.  They did not propose deducting money from their customers accounts and saying "Sorry!"
I'm not a fan of the 2008 bail-out.  If a bank fails, let it fail.  The people shouldn't have to be responsible for letting Bank of America continue to operate.  But the 2008 bail-out to this Bitfinex "solution" is not apples-to-apples.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:34:51
You guys can try to spin this any way you want, but this is shady-as-hell business practice by Bitfinex.  Bitfinex fucked up, not their customers.  They should fit the bill.  If they can't or won't, I'd suggest stopping doing business with them.
Imagine a bank did something like this?  You would all be ALL OVER IT.  "Bank loses money in robbery and pulls $ from all depositors accounts to cover business losses."

LOL this is total hindsight, like all it takes is a google search to "know the price would drop right back down".  
There was a dude in early 2017 who mortgaged his home and went all in on Bitcoin when it was $1,700.  Sure, it was a way too risky move regardless of the outcome, but people were saying the same thing... "WHY ARE YOU BUYING NOW AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH!?" and the price continued to spike 10x.
It's impossible to know what's going to happen in the short term.

The market cap of tether vs other crypto is not apples to apples.  You have to understand this.  Market cap of Bitcoin is assumed based on trading price * circulating supply.  You could theoretically have a huge market cap with very low liquidity.  With tether, the market cap is directly correlated with dollars invested into the system. 
1) There is no way that "there is no issue" is the *most likely* scenario.  Auditors don't go running because an audit is difficult.  They are getting paid.  This would have been a big win for Friedman if they completed it and offered an accurate and fair opinion.
2) The transparency about the $30m hack does at least provide some level of comfort that they are being genuine, I'll give you that.  Who knows, though.  I'm not trusting them.  Unless an independent audit is done, I'm not believing what any Company has to say about the state of their financials.
3) This 100% benefits them directly.  All they need to do is print USDT, send it to their accounts on various exchanges, and use it to buy up BTC and other crypto.  Then go running when the plan is exposed.  It's as plain as day to see how they benefit.
Hopefully everything is fine.  I'm not going to conclude everything is fine until an independent audit confirms it.  Even then, I would look at it skeptically, thinking they paid off the auditors.  If they're telling the truth, they went from managing $15 million USD a year ago to $2.3 billion today.   That is a staggering increase.   All while having issues with partnering banks.  There's just no way they did that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:00:15
Keep telling yourself this.  It depends on the level of fraud that is occurring.  And don't be naive, *some* level of fraud *is* occurring.
If it came out that the Tether folks stole or fraudulently printed a few million bucks, it would hurt the market in the short term, but not so bad.
If it came out that 90% of the Tether in circulation has no backing, was fraudulently printed and helped drive the price to $20k?  We're looking at a major, major decline in the crypto market that would take years to recover.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:49:22
Yes, you do.  You still paid the fee, even if you swung a profitable trade.  Paying a 4% cc fee and not receiving that same amount of cash back or equivalent in rewards never makes sense.  The profitability of your trade is totally independent of this.

@_date: 2018-01-28 17:05:27
It's a confidence thing, man. If tether turns out to be fraud and the markets were artificially inflated, people are going to have a hard time trusting demand and valuation going forward, at least in the short term.  The market isn't just a math equation, psychological impacts are real.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:14:39
Everyone needs to form their own opinion.  
Me personally?  I'll be okay with Tether only after an independent 3rd party reports out on them and its clean.  I'm not trusting anybody without some level of assurance.
This was supposed to be their business model, to be regularly audited, mind you.  It's published on their webpage.  Yet they haven't delivered.  No thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:55:29
This is simply not true.  Every $1 of market cap for Tether is supposed to equal $1 of investment into the crypto market. Every $1 of market cap for Bitcoin does *not* equal $1 of investment.
Comparing their market caps is apples to oranges.  Their fundamentals are entirely different.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:30:50
Fuck this.  Hey, listen, you should only invest what you're willing to lose, and of course it was unreasonable to expect 10x every year.  Yes, I believe every bit as much in Bitcoin long term today as I did in December at $20k peak and as much as I did in 2015 at $500.
But I sure do give a fuck if an asset I own loses value.

What I find hilarious someone can brush it off and actually have this kind of opinion.  It is explicitly against their terms.  They state on their page that everything is backed 1:1.  If they are fractional reserving, then they are violating their own terms and misleading their customers.  How is that okay?
And that assumes that they are fractional reserve lending in a completely legal and non-fraudulent way.  A small little crypto start up?  I have my doubts until it can be proven otherwise.

The constant posts may be silly but your arguments against cashing out are objectively stupid.  You're basically arguing if you're not buying to never sell you "invested more than you could lose" and "need the money to stay afloat".  Give me a break.

@_date: 2017-12-12 19:13:26
Several years is short-term in the investing world.  Bitcoin peaked at $1,300 in late 2013 and didn't get back to $1,300 for almost 3 1/2 years.
It is absolutely about risk tolerance.  And everybody's risk tolerance is different.  But whatever, man.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:50:25
Bubbles are incredibly difficult to pinpoint.  Only in hindsight does it become clear.
Look no further than Bitcoin in 2013.  Bubbled up to $1200 and popped down to under $200 thanks to Mt Gox.  In the rear view mirror it appears obvious.  At the time, it wasn't.  Lots of the sentiment you hear now is exactly the same as what was being thrown around back then.
I'm not saying we're in bubble territory, but I'm not naive enough to dismiss the idea completely.  What happens if China government regulation comes down hard?  What if it comes out that Bitfinex is conducting massive fraud?  These things could cause this to come tumbling down really quickly.
Being skeptical of current valuation after a 10X run-up in less than a year isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Being blindly loyal is.

@_date: 2015-06-10 17:51:35
I don't really know if these audits are occurring or not, but I can think of several reasons if I were a Bitcoin company why I may *not* do them:
1) Cost.  To carry any weight to current and prospective customers, the audit would have to be performed by a reputable, professional, independent 3rd party.  It would be a fairly significant cost relative to the value of the company to have these audits on an on-going basis.
2) Lack of customer acquisition resulting from an audit.  The only real reason (outside of any potential regulatory compliance) to do this audit would be to advertise to potential new customers that their technology and company is audited however frequently.  Would this give their company a competitive advantage?  Perhaps.  But also, perhaps not, at least not right now while Bitcoin is still limited to extremely early adopters.  Also, even if it does give them a competitive advantage, is that competitive advantage greater than the cost of the audits?  Perhaps when adoption rates rise and there's suddenly many "everyday folks" on the fence and the verge of adopting, this type of auditing will be crucial to gain their trust and business.
3) Reliability of the audit.  Bitcoin is such a new technology, I'm not sure we even have reputable, 3rd party independent auditors who could audit effectively and issue an opinion that would carry any sort of weight for potential new customers or investors.  It's much different if Deloitte is willing and has the expertise to come in and audit vs. Joe Schmoe Technologies.
4) What standard are we auditing to?  Accounting has US GAAP.  IT Auditing has ISACA.  What exists for Bitcoin that we can measure up against and say we are in compliance with, and what are we going to report out to our customers/investors?  This also leads to my last...
5) Upcoming regulations.  Does it make sense to invest in a certain type of audit now (which performs various specific testing) that could be totally meaningless and require the company to change gears to adhere to future regulations?  Perhaps it makes sense to first wait for regulation, and then audit to that standard and communicate to current and prospective customers that you are compliant.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:57:14
No, no, no.  Bitcoin won't stop people from buying on credit and spending money they don't have.  It's not like this digitized money is going to eliminate bad habits.  Bitcoin, USD, EUR, whatever, there will always be a market for credit and taking out loans.
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:14:51
This is not a huge surprise.  Right now, there is no reason for the general public to transfer USD to Bitcoin, and then pay with Bitcoin on their Overstock purchase.  It's too many steps.  Simply entering credit card information is far simpler.  And this doesn't even factor in volatility risk you assume when purchasing Bitcoin.
Not many people will jump through the hoops for no added (or perceived) benefit. 
I can see the platform first taking off as a method of money transfer (Western Union disrupter) before making a legit dent in the consumer retail space.

Overstock and Zynga may not be Amazon and Facebook, but these are big companies.  They are public companies required to file with the SEC and are audited.
They aren't mom and pops.
Before coming out with this news, these companies did a lot of research and consulted many individuals - regulators, shareholders, auditors, IT specialists, etc. - to determine if accepting Bitcoin is a viable option.  How are they going to collect and store?  How are they going to account for it?  How are they going to hedge against volatility?  How are they going to record their earnings and report out?  Are their shareholders comfortable with the strategy?  The fact that they got the go-ahead to begin accepting is tremendously encouraging.

@_date: 2016-06-27 14:53:12
But, the bank doesn't have $19 after the loan is paid back in your example, it still has $10!
I deposit $10
The bank loans out $9, keeping $1 in reserve.  Bank actually possesses $1, even though my bank account shows $10 (fractional reserve lending).
Borrower then pays back $9 to the bank.  The bank now has the $1 it possessed from my deposit it kept in reserve, plus $9 it was just paid back.  Which is... $10!  
My bank account still shows $10.  
You are forgetting about the LIABILITIES that lending money creates.  The money supply is not just increased and created without a corresponding LIABILITY.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:23:39
That is not at all how fractional reserve banking works.  Commercial banks do not create money "out of thin air".
I deposit $10 into the bank.  The bank lends out $9 and keeps $1 in reserve.  A borrower then owes the bank $9.  The bank has a reserve of $1 on my $10 deposit, but is also owed $9.  In a healthy economy this is okay.  However, if the borrowers stop paying the bank back, since the bank only reserves a fraction of their deposits, they do not have the capital to pay back depositors if the depositors all want to withdraw.  But this is where FDIC insurance (in the U.S.) comes into play.  Still, it's a zero-sum game, though.  Nothing is created "out of thin air" at 10x valuation of my deposit.
The central bank on the other hand, can print money and create it "out of thin air".  But the central bank is far different than commercial banks you're referencing as part of fractional reserve banking.
By the way, this shit would still exist with Bitcoin.  There will still be a need for loans, and people with surplus of Bitcoin wanting to earn a greater return than holding Bitcoin alone.
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:39:02
Why did you completely ignore the liabilities that are created as part of this process?  Or did you just skim over how I included that in my argument?  I said it's a zero-sum game, which it totally is.  Even in your example, money is not "created out of thin air" like a previous post suggested.
Oh that's right, because everyone here seems to be a conspiracy theory bitcoin loonie.  
There *is* a potential for bitcoin to succeed in the future alongside our current system, as a way to enhance efficiency.  I'm not sure why everyone thinks and believes the current system must collapse for bitcoin to succeed.  Or that a monetary policy such as the U.S.'s, which has succeeded for hundreds of years, is a failure because it's inflationary.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:26:29
I get your angle and am as pumped as anyone else for this run up, but this really doesn't make sense.
Comparing fiat currency to bitcoin is apples to oranges because goods for sale are not priced in bitcoin.  When bitcoin depreciates in value relative to USD you instantly lose purchasing power.  When USD depreciates in value relative to bitcoin, you do not.
Until merchants start pricing their goods for sale in bitcoin, it remains apples to oranges.

I hate to break it to you, but if Tether turns out to be a fraud it's going to cripple this market for awhile. 
It calls everything into question.  How much of 2017's bull run was legit demand vs. made up BS?  How much liquidity is even in this market right now?  What can investors trust, what can't we trust?  Is the market being manipulated some other way that we haven't figured out yet?
If Tether is proven a fraud, crypto prices would crash.  The uncertainty would be super high.  Bitcoin could bounce back, no doubt.  It's happened before, after Mt. Gox.  But don't fool yourself thinking that Tether failing would be nothing more than a speed bump.
I have no idea if Tether is legit or not.  But it sure doesn't pass the smell test.  If they just had and released a legit audit, all of this would go away overnight.

The answer is simple.  Despite what's happened in Greece, and the devaluing of the Chinese Yuan, cash is king.
During times of turmoil and perceived market uncertainty, investors flee risky assets for cash.  Investors aren't going to flee stocks and invest those funds in BTC.  Doesn't make sense from a risk perspective.  If they're willing to keep the risk, they'd keep their money where it is and not sell the stocks.  If they're selling the stocks, it's to hold cash temporarily, not dump it into another wildly volatile asset.

I see this time and time again.  Yes, bitcoin can replace certain services banks provide (credit cards, checking accounts, online payments, savings accounts, etc.).  However, there's a huge revenue stream for banks that have nothing to do with these consumer day-to-day services.
Where are loans going to come from?  How will people finance their cars, get mortgages, start businesses, go to college without a bank that is willing to lend them money?  This is how banks really make their money, and I don't see this demand going away because of cryptocurrency.  If anything, they'll use crypto currency (borrow and loan it) to their advantage, if they can and there's a demand for those services.

I really don't understand this push for "pay for content" within the Bitcoin community.
Sure, *some* content is good enough that people will pay for.  But most content online will lose viewership if people are forced to pay for it.

This is arrogant and incorrect.  Also, quite simply, your attitude reeks of jealousy of those who have built and/or evolved products or services that they have been able to sell to the market.  I suppose it's easier to point to "privilege" than accept that others may be better than us at building businesses.


There was an interesting poll taken around the 2016 election.  I can't recall the exact numbers or cite anything, so you can admittedly take my argument with a grain of salt, but there was a disproportionate number of republican respondents who replied "I'm doing good financially" vs. "The economy is doing good".  Their distaste for democratic leadership skewed the results.  Most admitted they were doing well, but could not stomach admitting their anecdotal evidence may also mean the economy was fine.  You're basically saying the same thing.  "I'm fine, but I'm not most people."  You know what?  You probably are most people.  


I did not misread your point.  And no, I don't agree with that.  Do those factors provide barriers to entry?  Sure.  Do all regulations makes sense?  No.  Those who disagree should point to the ones that don't and help eliminate or reform.  Do those execs and corporations "only remain as they are now" because of it?  Nope.  Companies are rising and falling all the time.
If you call believing we're in a world (or at least a country) where you are responsible for your actions and your successes (this applies to you as an individual, a small company, a large company, whatever) being in a blissful illusion bubble, then in a blissful illusion bubble I will remain.

You seem to have a victim mindset, one that thinks that only the elite have the tools to get ahead - which I strongly disagree with - so it probably isn't worth providing counterpoints, but I'll try.
Silver: This is the most untrue of all your claims.  20 years ago silver was priced at ~ $5 per oz.  Today it's ~ $15 per oz.  It does not lose purchasing power at the rate of the dollar.
Gold: I don't understand the market enough to refute your claim of manipulation, but if that is a concern for you, I don't know how you could possibly like the crypto market.
CDs: Sure, they may return less than inflation, but they do provide a return and it is more advantageous than leaving your money simply in cash.  Also, there are government bonds that are risk free that keep up with inflation.  Though I know your anti-government stance will have you firing back at me for even suggesting this.
Commodities: Don't understand why these aren't investments?  Because they don't provide a return or dividend?  Fine, but they still hold a place in a portfolio as a hedge against inflation.  
REIT ETFs can give you exposure to real estate without taking on any debt at all.  You don't need a $100m property or be leveraged up to your eyeballs in loans.
For what it's worth, I really like Bitcoin and the utility it can provide.  I'm just on the other side of the global economic red-pill spectrum.

The price going down will actually make you ignore it.  On the way up, you look at how much money you've made, and fantasize about some outrageous number and how rich you could be.
On the way down, you say "fuck it" and tend to forget about it.  Removing the attachment to the price fluctuation is liberating, but you're also poorer because of it.  Catch 22.

You took that part of his comment too literally and disregarded his actual point.
Spending and investing is important to grow an economy.  When you save your money in a bank or invest in businesses (stocks), your capital is contributing to the development of products and services and overall growth of the economy.  
Hoarding bitcoin is akin to saving cash under your mattress.  It keeps the capital out of the economy and stifles growth.

Wow, you're an asshole, dude.
You're basically saying you can grow a real estate business with not a lot of money, and if you're successful, have a pretty high net worth.  Well, duh.  I'm not arguing that.  That *is* a skill set, by the way.  Real estate investing and managing properties is not passive.  It's risky, too.  Leveraging up can yield big returns, but it can also really fuck you over if you fail.
My math of $16 an hour for 10 years will not yield a million in assets, regardless of level of spend, stands.  Just because you want to add variables like building a side-business to say people can get there even without education or a high-flying corporate job (which is what I think you're trying to say), doesn't mean my math is wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:07:56

Zero chance at that income level.   Yes, building $1m in assets in 10 years can be done, but not without a pretty solid salary.  
If you're going to save and invest $70k per year, assuming you have zero expenses, after accounting for taxes, someone earning $16/hour would need to put in something like 120 hours a week, for 52 weeks.

There's a lot of context that's missing here.  There is no way that 60% of merchants would Bitcoin as form of payment in lieu of USD as the title suggests.
Maybe the context was "utilizing a payment processor like Square, with fees of 1% and auto conversion to USD and daily deposits into your bank, would you prefer Bitcoin payment via Square or a payment from Visa/Mastercard which typically charge a 2-3% fee?"
To answer Visa/Mastercard to this question, you would need to be an idiot, even if you don't believe in Bitcoin at all.  It doesn't mean 60% of merchants don't want USD and would rather transact in Bitcoin.

Your point makes no sense in relation to the argument, though.  Money itself doesn't create revenue, either.  So no matter how you define Bitcoin - money or commodity, or some kind of hybrid like you are implying - it does not generate revenue or profit.

Bullshit, man.  If what you're saying was true, you wouldn't see pizza meme floated around constantly.  Or people begrudging their drug or Newegg purchases from 5 years ago, wishing they just held instead.
Of course some people will spend it on things they need/want.  However, general behavior will favor hoarding over usage.  It's going to be a challenge the network will need to overcome in order to grow.  Bitcoin's gone up a lot in value over the last couple years, so why should I spend my Bitcoin when instead I can hold it and make my purchases with USD?  Why send Bitcoin to my friends when I owe them money when I can just hold it and send them USD?

This is a bad mindset.  Bitcoin can provide great returns because it's so new and nobody really knows how to value it yet.  If it eventually catches on, it will evolve into a digital commodity and have a similar place in the investing world as Gold.  Store of value, keeps up with inflation, hedge against governmental policies.  Once it hits critical mass, growth outproducing stocks will be gone.
It's not an income producing asset.  It cannot moon forever.  Companies like Apple or Netflix can consistently provide strong returns for their shareholders because they produce revenue.  Commodities don't work this way.
I think Bitcoin is a great way for young people to begin investing, but you really need to look outside the crypto space too if you want a strong, diversified portfolio.

Correct, but it needs to be used and part of the economy to justify future value, and even current prices.  The valuation right now is driven on speculation that in the future, bitcoin is going to be a key component and method of payment for business transactions.
We can't value bitcoin on promise and speculation forever.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:54:07
I want to believe this, but I won't believe it until I see it.  We had a crazy bull run in 2013.  Big, publicly traded companies started accepting bitcoin (Overstock, Microsoft) - network fees were low to non-existent at the time.
Very few people actually used bitcoin to make purchases through those retailers, despite low fees.
Now, due to 2017's bull run, we need LN to make this possible again.  We will still arrive at the same question though - will people actually use their bitcoin for merchant purchases?  The answer in the past was.. not really.  We will see if this time is different.

5) They can buy whatever they want, wherever (within the U.S.A.) they want with dollars.

The price should not be driving adoption.  The usefulness needs to drive adoption.  If people are only joining the bitcoin network because the price is increasing, that's a problem.
This is my concern with calling 2017's growth "mass adoption".  Are people *using* bitcoin, or did they just hop aboard to make a buck?  In order for bitcoin to continue to grow, *usage* needs to grow.  There needs to be reason for people to have bitcoin other than price speculation.  Hopefully this happens.

@_date: 2018-02-14 14:59:54
There's just no way you can sound like you know what you're talking about by calling bitcoin "stable" and "growing very slowly".  Why, because it hasn't crashed in the last 6 days?  It is $9k right now.  8 days ago it was $6k.  2 months ago it was $20k.  4 months ago it was $8k.  1 year ago it was $1k.  This is a wildly volatile asset.  There's just no way around that right now.

It's price is decreasing due to supply and demand.  The non-static price of everything is a result of supply and demand.
Your question should be more targeted to at these prices, why is there more supply of bitcoin right now than demand?
I could argue a few theories:
1 - The 2013 bubble still lingers, and the $1k+ prices was artificially inflated anyways, there was never really true underlying broad demand for the prices we saw all of 2014.
2 - There is significant continuous pressure to sell bitcoins for fiat.  2 reasons behind this: 1) miners have to pay their bills in fiat; and 2) merchants that are currently accepting bitcoin are almost exclusively doing it through Bitpay or Coinbase type of service provider.  Bitpay/Coinbase receives the bitcoin from the consumer, immediately sells it for fiat, and provides fiat to the merchant.  Consumers would need to be buying bitcoin at the same rate as they spend it to keep a price equilibrium, which brings me to my next theory:
3 - Users are not "sold" yet and do not see or understand the benefits.  It is still a cumbersome process to purchase bitcoins and then figure out how to and where to spend them at the moment.  Its much easier to just spend fiat.  Many see bitcoin as not solving a problem in their lives.  Therefore, they're not buying bitcoin (less demand)
4 - There is concern government regulation could greatly hamper the future use of bitcoin.  This concern deters speculative investors (buyers).
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:58:27
Well, right now, it simply is not very useful for the average consumer.  Which is why there is basically no demand for it.  I own for speculation purposes.  I'm willing to admit that.  It's a small percentage of my portfolio.
Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.  Just because Bitcoin went on to spectacular bubbles in the past, it doesn't mean it will happen in the future.  There is a fine line between holding/buying at low prices and trying to catch a falling knife.
I'm not saying it's doomed to fail, but to simply ignore the current Bitcoin supply and demand and brush it off as insignificant is silly.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:54:10
Not at all. Bitcoin represents less than 5% of my "invested" portfolio.  Doesnt mean I'm cool with it losing value and don't give a shit. 
Not investing more than you can lose is not equal to not giving a shit if it goes to zero.
Yea, I want to see it spread. I want digital currencies to take off because it's so efficient. I also want Bitcoin to become really valuable.

Yes, but at what point do you come to the conclusion you may be wrong?  It's not so easy.
For example, when Palm released the Pre, I thought WebOS was so far ahead of any other mobile OS that it was going to compete with Apple, Blackberry, and Android.  I bought PALM stock.  While being a believer in their OS - even now, I think it was ahead of its time - I was clearly wrong on the company.
If I had been able to read the market better, I could have unwound my position at a better point in time.  Unfortunately, I didn't.
Obviously, comparing Bitcoin to a company is apples and oranges, but I think you get my drift.
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:56:20
He's absolutely right, though.  And you're acknowledging he's right, albeit in a backhanded way.
If "the world" (which I would call the mass general public) cared about Bitcoin right now, the Bitcoin network would have to be far more valuable (and therefore, have a higher value per coin) than it does right now to handle the net worth and transactions of all of those individuals.  However, right now, "the world" doesn't care about Bitcoin.
Maybe they will in the future, maybe they won't and it will stay a niche.  Time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:03:40
My entire point is that the values can't keep rising without use case being applied.  People need to actually find benefit in the network and use it for *something*.  That will bring value to the network.  Sustainable demand isn't something that's just wished upon and all you need to do is wait.  Speculation bubbles may come here and there, but they won't stick.
This graph implies that there wasn't usage adoption during 2017's bull run, and people have limited general interest in the use case, at least at this time.  They are interested in profiting from the speculation.  One is good, one is not so good.

But why would you park your wealth in bitcoin as a hedge against inflation when there's other assets that can accomplish that goal, and currently do it better?  Bitcoin is wildly volatile, and the other assets are way more stable (precious metals, real estate, etc.)
I'm sorry, but you can't convince me the Bitcoin network is going to be worth a ton in the future if it isn't going to have a use case beyond "storing wealth".
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:20:16
I don't find that funny at all, actually.  What is disappointing about this is that newcomers are attracted by the price increase and the hope of earning a big ROI.  Once that idea goes away, they couldn't care less.
This is not sustainable.  We need people to want to actually *use* bitcoin.  We want newcomers to come into it because it's an efficient way to transfer money and helps their lives in some way.  That first needs to happen to lead to a huge price increase.  Not the other way around.

This is an incredibly stupid argument.  There are endless examples of technologies that failed and didn't catch on.

How is Bitcoin competition to an investment bank?  If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, a bank like JPM will incorporate it into their service offerings.

Because of something called compound interest?
In your example, your $100 appreciated by 100% to $200.  Let's assume the same rate of growth for simplicities sake.  Now, you could buy that thing for $100 and have $100 left, or, you could continue to hoard the $200 for one more year and you'd now have $400.
I'm not saying you, in your situation, would not spend.  But society as a whole would hoard over spending/investing.

You think the world should value bitcoin today, an asset invented 8 years ago, to the total value of gold in existence, an asset that has literally thousands of years of holding its value.  You also think the network doesn't need to be actually used by anyone to balloon to a $300k per btc value.  Status quo is fine.

What's the problem with fractional reserve lending?  How the fuck are they supposed to make money - and why the fuck would they exist - if they couldn't lend money they are borrowing from others?  That's what they do, and they lend for more basis points than they pay.
If that didn't exist, home mortgages wouldn't exist.  Did you finance that car you bought?  Sorry.  That wouldn't exist either.
If your problem is that regulation is too loose allowing these banks to lever the fuck up and when shit goes bad they just look to the government for help... well, OK.  But for some reason people jump on this "fractional reserve lending" like it's a bad thing, when in reality, when done right, it churns the economy and let's businesses innovate, grow, and hire.

This isn't quite right, though.  As the primary currency, the EUR is absolutely stable within it's borders.  10 euros buys lunch in Germany today, just like it did a year ago, even though it's decreased significantly vs. the USD.  Likewise $10 lunch in the US today gets you the same $10 lunch as last year, despite the currency increasing significantly vs. the EUR.
Price does matter for Bitcoin, though.  If we priced everything in Bitcoin, then I'd agree the FX rates wouldn't really matter so much because 1 BTC will equal a basket of goods regardless (more or less) of what the exchange rate is.
But things aren't priced in Bitcoin.  They are priced in fiat currency and a calculation is made to arrive at what it costs in Bitcoin.
Apples and Oranges at the moment.

I'd love to see Bitcoin succeed, but it's future is simply not clear right now, and there are going to be a wide array of opinions of what the future will hold.
Just because someone does not believe it's going to be as revolutionary as you do, it doesn't mean they are being ignorant or defensive.  
I do like that your conclusion is not "I thought this guy was forward-looking, but he's really an idiot" and instead is something smart - that someone with his background having the opinions he does leads you to believe it could take a lot more education and time for Bitcoin to truly take off (paraphrasing/expanding on what you wrote).

So stupid, their purchasing power is (more or less) unchanged, unless all of those 330 million Europeans are planning a US vacation.  In Europe, their buying power has remained constant. 
Just like your USDs buy you the same shit they did last year, despite being worth way more vs. the EUR over the same time period.
Bitcoin is a different animal because *things aren't priced in Bitcoin*.  If Bitcoin's exchange rate drops, so does your buying power.
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:31:09
30% Bitcoin discount is not entirely true.  It's basically a $30 coupon when you spend $100 or more valid for the next week.  So yes, you'd get a 30% discount if you buy something for exactly $100, but would get a 3% discount if you buy something for $1,000.
Still, pretty cool.

Not really. You should explain and learn the risk appetite of your clients. Paying down mortgage is a risk free return and gives the home owner peace of mind.

Be fair.  He didn't dismiss Bitcoin entirely, and even at one point even suggested he hoped it succeeded.  He sees usage, but just not a store of value.  By the way, since that day, a Bitcoin investment would be down ~50%.  Still, he's not right or wrong yet.
“Stay away. Bitcoin is a mirage. It’s a method of transmitting money. It’s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it.

I agree - but the key is step 2 - investing that money and not keeping it "under your mattress".

My point was that millennials will need loans, just like every other generation.
No, that's not all banks do.  But that's partially where their 'skin in the game' comes from.  If whoever they loaned money to stops paying them back, they are stuck with a loss.  
Let's compare to a current p2p alternative.  If someone who borrows through LendingClub stops paying their loan, LendingClub is in the clear, only the individual investor is stuck with the loss.
(disclosure - I invest through LendingClub and think it's a great platform. I just don't think the p2p model is scalable to replace traditional banking)

That's exactly what LendingClub does.  And it's great... for small loans.
How about a small business that's applying for $1m to start up their brick and mortar store?  A lot more research has to go into it than looking at a credit score before you loan them $1m, right? - what's the business plan? who are your target customers? who are your competitors?  what's your projected revenue for year 1, 3, 5?  what is your strategy to accomplish those goals?  what is your expected cash flow each of the next 5 years?
It's not so simple, and a lot of careful research and analyzing needs to go into it before you give somebody $1m.

Come on.  Let's try to be objective and smart and come to an independent conclusion. 
Banks fucked up badly by assuming real estate prices could not depreciate.  They continued to fuck up when they loaned unqualified buyers too much money.  When the unqualified buyers couldn't pay back the mortgages they couldn't afford in the first place *and* the home prices depreciated, all hell broke loose.  Blame lies on the banks, and to a lesser extent, the people who took out loans that they should have been smart enough not to.
Plenty, and I mean plenty, of regional banks went under as a result (  To say that only taxpayers were on hook for their errors is simply wrong.
Yes, there was TARP.  It was issued to certain banks to help through the crisis.  Yes, you are right, it was funded by tax payers.  And also, which many people tend to forget, is it was all *paid back* to the tax payers.  
No doubt, banks fucked up, and the government stepped in to minimize damages.  But this happens in other industries, too.  Are you against the auto industry?
But I digress.  The point of my statement was that if a car loan goes bad, the bank is stuck with having to try to repossess the car, and sell that car, likely at a loss.  It is in their monetary interest to carefully underwrite their loans, otherwise they'll go out of business extremely quickly.  If this underwriting process fell into a 3rd party without the risk of default (and collected a fee to simply match the loaner/borrower) their interests would not be aligned with either the loaner or borrower's financial situation, and instead simply interested in pumping out as many as possible to collect commission.

This graphic was obviously created by someone who is pro-bitcoin.  Something like this just makes me think Bitcoin supporters are nervous that Facebook payments will be a significant hurdle to a more broad Bitcoin adoption.
If you stand by that your opinion is better, why not at least do it objectively?  The only metric which seems free of subjectivity is the one on how long it takes to clear.
Facebook payments are intended as friend to friend, not as a method to pay a merchant.  The creator of this graphic knows this, but it's convenient for his argument, so why not?
As far as international payments, no Facebook won't support it initially, but it can and likely will in the future.  The functionality was *just* rolled out.
Saying Bitcoin costs .03 and then saying Facebook costs you your privacy, while true, is presented in a homerific fashion.  Why not man up and break it out and state the facts objectively?  Bitcoin costs .03, Facebook is free.  Bitcoin is anonymous, Facebook is not.

I love how all of the responses pretty much fit exactly into what the OP is getting at - that opinions of Bitcoin seem to be binary.  Just happens on this thread that the binary answer is pro-bitcoin, anti-fiat.
I think on one end of the spectrum (the Bitcoin supporters) you have a lot of individuals who tend to be more attracted to the ideology than the tech.  Not saying they're not into the tech, but if they were to rank, ideology comes 1, tech 2.
On the other end of the spectrum (those indifferent to Bitcoin) they don't see Bitcoin as solving a problem in their lives at all at the moment.  Therefore, they have fairly strong feelings that it simply isn't necessary.
There tend to be very few people in the middle, such as myself, who are more intrigued by the tech and believe that there could be a more efficient finance world where many legacy financial processes and bitcoin can live together.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:10:20
Many smart financial professionals (way smarter than me) believe small, incremental inflation is necessary for a strong, growing economy.
This makes sense to me.  It encourages people with money to spend it or invest it; which puts the capital back into the economy - allowing companies to earn more, expand, and create jobs.  
Deflation, to me, sounds dangerous.  If my money is going to be worth more in the future, there would be heavy incentive to not spend or invest.  I think this hoarding mentality would reduce our working capital as a whole and limit economic growth.

By my argument, if *all* goods are going to be cheaper in the future (deflationary environment), it will hurt our economy.  Less people would spend, and less people would invest.  This would lead to lower working capital for the businesses, less innovation, and fewer jobs. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:39:28
I'm not talking about the absolute value of the home prices.  I'm talking about mortgage (borrowing) rates.  They are at or very close to all-time lows (at least in the US).  Meaning the general home-buying population is paying less interest to banks than ever.
If savings account interest rates rise, mortgage rates too, will rise.  The two are correlated.

Theoretically yes, but 4% risk-free return (not taking out a mortgage) vs 6-8% with risk is going to be a personal decision.  It's not a slam dunk one way or the other.
For some people, the peace of mind you get from owning your home outright can more than make-up for that delta in interest.  For someone who comes from a poor background like the OP said, whose family never owned a home?  It must be an unbelievable feeling.  I can't ever argue someone did the *wrong* thing when they paid off their mortgage.

Because successful businesses know that they have to adapt to demand and market change, duh.  
Why has Netflix basically abandoned mailing DVDs to your house and instead invested a ton of money so they could digitally stream movies to your TV?  The DVD model was extremely profitable for them at the time, wasn't it?
Why did Verizon and AT&amp;T expand and build a costly 4G data network when they were making "guaranteed returns" 15 years ago selling cell plans on their network that only included calls and texts?
If banks assess that there is a future market dealing with Bitcoin, then they will adapt too.

Ay. This analogy is tired, and quite frankly, silly.  It's apples to oranges, and honestly, no less ridiculous than this asinine statement:
How Bitcoin reminds me of Beanie Babies of 20 years ago, and where we're headed.
I remember reading news articles of Beanie Babies skyrocketing in value.  People were clamoring to understand what the big deal was.  Some people claimed that they revolutionized the teddy bear market because of their pocketable size and soft fabric, kids loved collecting the different types.  The market got caught up, and even people without kids were interested in scooping some up because of their meteoric rise in value in a short period of time had them seeing dollar signs.  Soon thereafter, people realized that Beanie Babies served an similar purpose as current teddy bears, and the euphoria ended swiftly, with Beanie Babies losing all of their value.

More investment = more innovation is absolutely simplistic, but it's not wrong.
Using your 2000 dot-com example... while there was certainly a spectacular asset bubble burst in the short-term resulting from a new industry that the market didn't know how to value, the innovation absolutely has driven a new industry which has created even more innovation and an incredible amount of new, high paying jobs that didn't exist before - driving growth and GDP.  
You were able to articulate your opinions, which most here can't, so kudos to that and agree to disagree.

My points are theoretical to a deflationary economic environment.  Bitcoin is not any economy's primary currency and very, very much a niche, so the spending habits today cannot be compared to a true deflationary environment.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:33:04
I didn't think I would need to point this out, but obviously, I'm talking in relative terms.  Of course people would spend in a deflationary environment.  We need things to survive - shelter, food, transportation, etc.
However, the disposable income we have - for our retirement, extra savings, non-necessity purchases, etc. - will have a tendency to be hoarded vs. spent and/or invested in comparison to an inflationary environment.
And I do think the limited working capital resulting from this would have a significant impact on the economy - companies take fewer risks with the capital they do have, fewer people are spending so profits are lower - less jobs, to name a few.

Happens all the time.  Have you never heard anybody say "I'm waiting for the next iPhone to come out" or "I'm waiting for the 60" TV to come down to $500 before buying"? 
Eventually, the utility of the good wins out and the purchase is made because it adds value to the purchasers life, but people absolutely delay these purchases knowing they will be cheaper/better in the future.

Do you understand what a banks primary revenue stream is?  Based on your comment, I don't think you do.  It's not the little fees here and there that you are charged for your checking account.
Banks make money by borrowing and lending.  If it's legal to, and there is a market for it, they'll borrow and lend Bitcoin the very same way they do USD now.

It's easy for an 18 year old millennial to say banks are useless, until he gets a little older and realizes he hasn't saved enough yet wants to buy a car... or start his own small business.... or buy a house.
So how are they going to get loans in 5 years?  All p2p?  The problem with p2p on a mass scale is underwriting.  It's hard to trust a 3rd party to do this to the best of their ability when they don't also have skin in the game.  It can work for small loans on LendingClub/Prosper, but it's going to be incredibly difficult to scale to larger loans so investors are reasonably comfortable.

Like it or not, banks incorporating Bitcoin into their service offerings is necessary to gain mass public adoption.
And don't believe that banks "don't want to deal" with Bitcoin.  If they think they can provide services within the law which will make them money, they'll gladly deal with it.  Right now, the law part remains murky, so they are keeping their distance.  It is an extremely regulated industry, obviously.

While I understand where you're going with this, saying "stocks are diversified" makes no sense.
A portfolio of stocks can be diversified, is what I think you meant.  However, owning only equities is still not even being properly diversified, depending on your age and risk tolerance.  That's where bonds, CDs, real estate, to name a few, come into play.

It's not always better for every individual or business... but the economy as a whole would be less innovative if it took less risks.
If Apple would turn a profit by doing nothing and simply sitting on their appreciating cash, why would they risk that and spend boat loads of money building a watch, or (potentially) electric cars that may fail?

While its easy to draw a conclusion on this, every company lists many risks in their 10k that could impact their business, even ones they believe have a very, very little chance of occurring.  Its not much different than reading the side effects of the side of an Advil bottle.

Just because you plan to spend it at some point in the future, it doesn't mean you can't invest it today and increase the economy's working capital.  That's the whole point, lending money you don't need today to generate future profits.
And, a whole lot of people invest - I'm not sure where you're getting "nobody does that".  Ever hear of 401k, IRA, 529, etc?  
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:12:34
I'll assume you are a young kid and don't understand how the economy works.
Since nearly all businesses, and definitely all material goods, require an upfront investment, there is a risk of losing capital with all of them, right?  We don't know if it will or won't be successful, and money has already been spent.
If our society is willing to take on more risk (ie, start more businesses, bring new ideas to market); it is more likely to be innovative than a society less willing to take this risk.  Therefore, the amount of risk our society is willing to take is directly proportional to the likelihood of innovation.

I've heard this idea thrown around and also don't understand the appeal.  Let's use music streaming as an example, which is brought up quite often.
Micro-payments would be an administrative nightmare for the merchant.  Imagine Spotify's back-offices having to record every single micro-payment and what it was for each and every time someone played an a la cart song?  They would need an invoicing process for every single play of a song that's billed via micro-transaction and have a record of it - who they billed, the amount they received, the date, etc.  It would be an absolute nightmare to implement.
Then even on the consumer side, do I want my wallet transaction history showing thousands of line items at a few pennies worth of Bitcoin each?  I'd have no idea what was for what and have to sift through thousands of items to get comfortable that I wasn't overcharged and I paid the appropriate amount.
I don't see it.

So what, we can't reference studies or what economists - people who dedicate their lives to this stuff - say?  Sure, we should all educate ourselves the best we can and formulate our own opinion, but developing and leveraging experts is what our society is founded on.  If your doctor recommends you have surgery to remove what he believes is a cancerous tumor, are you not going to listen to him because you're big, bad pb1x who doesn't let other people influence his decisions?  
Nobody is forcing an investment.  My point was that an inflationary environment promotes lending, which spurs growth.  And sure, you can invest in commodities.  In fact, it's a great way to diversify.  However, I'd call you a moron if your investing strategy was 100% in commodities.  It would be only slightly less dumb than having 100% of your net worth in Bitcoin.
Nobody is forcing you to put money in the bank.  You are free to keep it under your mattress, if you prefer.  It's just far advantageous for you to not do that, which is why I'm guessing you don't right now.
Your tax argument makes no sense, and quite frankly, smells of naivety.  Do you think you won't owe taxes in a Bitcoin world?  Bitcoin or USD, you will still owe taxes.  
Your last point has some merit.  Risk bearing assets which have historically exceeded inflation is a luxury typically reserved for high earners.  However, if the economy isn't growing, the low-skilled laborers are some of the first to be replaced by lower cost technology (think self-checkout grocery machines).  Also, I've been reading a whole lot lately about raises to minimum wage - Seattle has a plan to raise it to $15/ hr within the next few years.  So while minimum wages may lag behind inflation, it does catch up.
This isn't to say I think Bitcoin is dead.  I think it's an awesome technology and can be a huge game changer in the money transfer space.  I'm just having a hard time understanding how it will penetrate and make an significant impact on retail as a currency.

I know you've been taught all of these things.  I know your bosses told you this is the way to treat your clients best.  You have to understand that your interests do not always align with theirs.  This is exactly one of those scenarios. 
You're spitting out basic personal finance stuff like you need an MBA with 20 years as a financial advisor to understand it.  Clearly you're pretty inexperienced since you're implying the stuff you rattled off is complex.  Mortgage interest is tax decuctible?! No way man!  Who knew?! 
Avoiding interest is equally as beneficial as earning interest.  "Risk-free return" is obviously a little hyperbole, but if you disagree with the premise I was alluding to, don't know what to tell you.
No, not every financial advisor is scummy.  I'm not suggesting that at all.  But ones that would suggest they "couldn't disagree more" with the OP's plan to buy his home OUTRIGHT... well, that sets off alarm bells, man.
For some people, the peace of mind you get from owning your home outright can more than make-up for the delta in interest. For someone who comes from a poor background like the OP said, whose family never owned a home? It must be an unbelievable feeling of comfort. I can't ever argue someone did the wrong thing when they paid off their mortgage.

You are way over-thinking this.  The elephant in the room is that as of today, Bitcoin is not convincing most people that it makes their lives better or easier in any way.  They aren't adopting because they don't see it solving a problem in their lives or making anything more efficient.  Stop trying to over-analyze.
This isn't to say that they'll feel the same in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years from now  There's now a lot of companies out there with a lot of capital working to improve the Bitcoin platform.  A lot can change.

This is such a misinformed, naive statement.  The USD is inflationary in nature.  Just because it has strengthened recently relative to other currencies, does not make it deflationary.
If you had even sort of knew what you were talking about, you would have at least pointed to the CPI which was -.1% for Jan 2015.

The non-significant price movement immediately following halvening just shows that the halvening was already priced into the value of bitcoin.  This really shouldn't come as a surprise.  There was probably only downside risk to the halvening, if something went horribly wrong the price could have crashed down considerably.  Everything seems okay so we stay the course.

Incredibly stupid.  Everybody thought they would be rich when the price crossed $2k last year, too.  That was an astronomical threshold at the time.  A dude wrote that he put his entire net worth (which was almost $300k if I recall) in bitcoin at $1,700 per coin and everyone told him he was an idiot because the price had gone up so much in the previous few months.  It then proceeded to go up 10x more before the bubble popped.
Also, just because more people think it's a dog of an investment, that doesn't mean it's going to shoot back in the future.  Sometimes, the masses are right.  By your logic, you should be doing everything you can to get your hands on Bitconnect right now!  Nobody believes in that anymore, and anyone holding it probably feels pretty poor right now.

You completely missed the point. The point is not to compare one to the other. Obviously they are nothing alike. The point is that just because owners of the asset may feel "poor" and lost a ton of value, it doesn't mean the asset has to go up in value in the future. Sometimes there is blood in the streets for a reason.

This true and not true.  You're right that bubbles happen when you have an over valuation of a stock/commodity/etc.  The valuation drives whether it's a bubble, not necessarily a belief or disbelief in the underlying asset.
Bubbles absolutely happen to assets with real value.  The housing bubble in the U.S. is a perfect example.  No need to explain how housing has real value, but we got into a bubble where valuation exploded out of control and eventually popped.
Bitcoin is another perfect example of bubbles with value behind it.  The valuation of Bitcoin got ahead of itself several times in it's history, and a bubble formed and eventually popped.  It doesn't mean the technology was a fraud, only the valuation at the time.

His statement is clearly bias and overly negative, but like it or not, his point about the 2017 bull run reaching all remaining fools in a greater fools theory is not crazy.  
Personally, I think we are done with speculative bull runs.  The next bull run will need to be fueled by utility and demand for coins for something other than price speculation.
