@_date: 2016-01-25 18:13:11
I actually agree with him, Luke. Because of the profit margins on GPU silicon it would be relatively trivial for a company like Bitmain to make 100,000s of GPU-esque chips and put them into more convenient formfactors. Unless the algorithm was literally "render the latest game in 3840p" and WAS a graphics benchmark, Bitmain's GPU-chip would still delete the market in 6 months.
What would also happen if Nvidia decided to put a few Exahash on the network with all their self manufactured cards? I mean we can't stop them, they're just as deserving to mine as any of the rest of us.
And going back to what I said before, it doesn't matter if we did magically all have to use a GTX 970 when Bitmain has 10,000 in a warehouse with negligible power costs. The difficulty would rise until only they can profitably mine where as everyone else would have to mine for heat or 'fun'.

Reading through it now but I already disagree with him. I'll edit with my comments as I go.


If you consider this an inheriently bad thing, then maybe you don't know the Chinese very well. Avalon brought us decentralised ASICs. Bitmain brought us decentralised ASICs on a scale no one else could. The US on the other hand - the country that we all trust - churned out scam after failure after scam.


Also known as competition. If you expect 1,000 chefs to all agree how much paprika to add, you're going to have a bad time.


And? Markets fluctuate, prices fluctuate, and not being free is not a "its dead" specification. There are still a multitude of advantages over credit cards so this is just silly.


Both Bitmain and F2pool have said they want larger blocks, and will support gradually increasing caps. But.... the developers are too busy acting like 5 year olds to agree on anything, so there is nothing Bitmain or F2pool can do for now. Neither accepts a hard fork as an acceptable solution.


Yep that makes sense, the Chinese want to tank Bitcoin to make their own block rewards worthless.


XT was a shit idea, a hard fork for whatever reason = lets just pack up and go home. However block size should increase and the other devs should get a kick up the ass. I don't know. Why don't we take Core out of GM's hands if he's such a problem?

Why do you see that as a good thing? If criminals are very publicly being criminals, why shouldn't BTC-E do everything they can to help prosecute a scammer?

Since we refused to join the Euro, no. Imagine Europe (-UK) as states of the US all using the same currency. If Delaware defaulted, the rest of the US would implicitly devalue because they share the same currency.

Don't have a clue :/ Looks like this is useless for windows then if you can't point it to a hard drive to scan.

Seriously can't get this to work on 33 or 27 in windows. On 33 it says invalid syntax line 4, on 27 it responds ./keyhunter.py &lt;filename&gt;. I see no way to respond to this command, or what I'm meant to put.
