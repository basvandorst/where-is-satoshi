So, why is the mempool emptying? Some big player implemented segwit or what? I would love to know... although I guess it would mostly be speculation.

We met very friendly dogs and cats in Thailand. Even if theyre friendly, they sure aren't clean or healthy! We tried avoiding touching the strays. Even the super-cute kittens..
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:08:56
As a tourist its a bit heart-breaking seeing how the dogs are basically abused by restaurant owners, at the same time we could surely understand why theyr'e a problem, and that it just gets worse if you give them any food.
I was not always successful in telling my fiancee not to smuggle some scraps out to the dogs....

This is a scenario I would believe in. Nobody talks about Kleiman, with him it makes sense.
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:15:34
Balance is correct, if any more evidence is needed.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:27:21
Would love a subbed version of this!
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:29:22
Sure you should treat the data with suspicion, but a lot of people are saying that it looks legit. My withdrawals looked spot on.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:28:52


I think you are. As far as I remember, Satoshi disappeared long before the foundation existed. I think the lead developer Gavin had the OK from Satoshi to keep developing bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:31:26
Yeah, you are right. Will these be even remotely profitable?
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:24:43
What is this? Trezor or trezor-like device?
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:17:49
Its really not "a very big problem". I think the foundation is simply being practical, it is a problem due to how enchanges/wallets do things, and its best for everyone if it was fixed in code. This is an efficient way of doing things, do them only once its necessary. 
It agile development :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 08:34:13
Very nice! 50 Bits
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:32:29
Well, I guess not being verified has it perks! 
Also, I never expected to get anything out of gox before I verified. I'm now glad I didn't!
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:57:57
Oops, if they have ~180k actual BTC, theyre lacking some funds... :(
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:32:24
Made me laugh in the office!
@_date: 2016-03-04 12:02:29
"If we raised the blocklimit to 2 MB, attacker would need to spam 110%. 11 times more expensive to attack the system!! In addition, this would allow more real bitcoin users in the future."
Absolutely and patently false. It is obvious that the number of transactions will simply rise to 2MB if we increase the blocklimit. Maybe slowly, but it will happen probably quicker than people realize. What happens when you buy a new harddrive? You always manage to fill it up to ~95%, when you force yourself to clean up some old shit! 
Demand is not infinite but I am convinced it is elastic. It will become a bit cheaper for transactions if we increase the blocksize meaning more people will transact.
@_date: 2016-03-03 08:52:54


But gradually. Its not like some day in 20 years, suddenly all rewards disappear and fees are supposed to take over.

I have bought a factory new car with visa, so sure it is possible. I know though that my bank decides a whole lot, for example they starting blocking certain internet sites, and that was not Visa's wrongdoing apparently, but my bank.
@_date: 2016-03-08 11:47:57
Its crowded there...
@_date: 2016-03-08 11:42:47
For sure, I mined 50 btc and immediately sold it for next to nothing. Why oooh why.....
@_date: 2016-06-21 06:12:50


My nexus 5x reliably runs at 0%, and then shuts down when it would have gone to -1.... :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:58:31
I am, just put in a buy order yesterday at prices slightly below current, so I hope that gets filled soon! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:36:40
I mined 50 BTC on my cpu once. 
I don't much care though, its really not different from the stock market. If you could have predicted the future regular stocks could have made you rich, too.
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:37:22
Ok, I see exactly what is in this image; 
But the wording is very different. I see no button that starts with "Confirm..." As a non-native english speaker the button texts seems to mean the same thing, and I do get a result from the penultimate button in the image. Its the last button that does nothing.
@_date: 2012-08-22 07:33:33
Down for me as well, from a Swedish ISP. Also, "It's not just you!  looks down from here."
@_date: 2012-06-09 21:00:19
Why would you buy when theyre up?! Comments such as these always amaze me ;)
@_date: 2012-08-17 20:43:31
Haha. I bought at 13, sold at 15. Bloody lucky. I was going to buy at 10 again, but then it went up. I love the predictability of revert-to-means after some volatility...
@_date: 2016-02-27 07:03:55
Same here, just a page that says "Error"
@_date: 2012-06-21 10:33:52
Have you tried bitspinner? Its already pretty easy to pay...
But yeah, of course services to help with this will appear all over the place.
@_date: 2012-11-29 13:14:18
Thank you for adding stability to bitcoins!
@_date: 2012-11-08 13:29:27
OMG, that is a lot of text...
@_date: 2012-07-05 07:07:59
That physical escrow service seems nice, but that adds to the shipping cost I assume? 
@_date: 2012-08-30 07:54:20
It still takes some effort to gain reputation in a WoT. This is not news. Which means to do what pirate did was actually made harder by the WoT (he must have done something right to gain that trust, right?). It's not a panacea though.
@_date: 2012-08-22 08:06:32
Merkle trees are actually used some in p2p, sadly not for torrents, which would avoid the entire problem of different hashes for the exact same file. 
DC++ implemented merkle trees many years ago, and other p2p software before that, emule maybe?
@_date: 2012-06-26 06:56:09
Me too. Weirdly enough, I did recently try logging in with an incorrect password so this almost got me. Chrome warned about phishing though, and I heeded that warning.
@_date: 2012-08-22 07:37:55
Funny fact: the more complex an analysis, the more likely that it is an incorrect one.
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:28:13
Interesting how visible the effect is on the price! Someone moved the market without every wasting any money. Inefficient market.
@_date: 2012-06-21 06:24:26
Outside the capabilities.
@_date: 2012-08-23 18:40:37
Is this about whether or not pirate pays back? What are the exact requirements? What if he pays 99% back? He is apparently already over 0%...
@_date: 2012-08-31 06:05:12
Wasn't this explained as something trivial by some geologist?
@_date: 2012-10-12 07:06:23
Yeah, it could have read "This could use a fork that uses Bitcoin"
@_date: 2012-09-11 12:22:51
Mining, really?
@_date: 2012-06-21 19:43:24
I want that.
@_date: 2012-08-28 08:44:03
Why is it sweet? Lower fees than mtgox?
@_date: 2012-08-28 08:17:58
Why is the video unlisted?
@_date: 2012-09-04 06:06:44
I'm pretty sure this applies to cash, too. People do stupid shit all the time, and they should be free to. Smarter people will soak that money up and hopefully do somthing better with it!
@_date: 2012-08-22 07:34:18
Weird, I do get a page, but with a 500 error and a cat picture.
@_date: 2012-07-17 07:16:16
Holy volatility batman!
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:48:31


To be honest, the android eclair wallet truly sucks. I could only use it for a handful of transactions before it became unusable. I tried reinstalling even, many times, but it never seemed to be able to find any routes, I think anyway since I got no real error information from my "PENDING" transactions.
The LND desktop app works much better seemingly.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:02:51
Right, the UI is very good. I was just very frustrated that it stopped working for me after just a few days.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:51:49
When first trying out the eclair android wallet, transactions literally took seconds! Sometimes less. 
Fast-forward to today, and I almost never succeed even getting a transaction through. Nobody is talking about this. Is this the routing (or lack thereof?) or bad nodes, or just bugs?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:29:54
It hasnt ever peaked again that fast though,.... or has it? /memory like a goldfish
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:14:05
Yes, this is the way to do it!
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:51:44
He is likely not holding, but have rather lost the keys. As many, many others.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:30:09
How could you track newly minted coins, for example? Defeating mixers might be possible given enough data, but there has to be numerous ways to keep bitcoins anonymous _if you really want to_.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:56:28
Whoever would dump that many coins is likely smarted than just dumping it, all at once, in the open. They would lose a lot of money when the markets panics before they sell it all!
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:18:21
Came here to say this!
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:35:30
Buy a cheap motorola or something newer for Gods sake! Yes, it will make you happy! (Ok, just kidding...)
@_date: 2011-02-10 23:00:47
It never crashed as far as I know. The amount of volatility seems to be partly because just a tiny fraction of the economy is openly traded. This makes it cheap to move the market wildly, but this should get better with time.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:19:33
So the less HODL you see, the more you should buy!
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:05:59


I assume/hope that there are certificates that provide better protection against identity theft/DNS spoofing etc. Such as the cert that mtgox uses, which makes the browser bar green.
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:34:43
So, its even better to have a self-signed cert that people only explicitly allows, then to trust certificates signed by someone else since they can just be bought, and you dony . Would someone taking over DNS really be able to spoof his identify so well as to be able to buy buy a new certificiate? Thats bad. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:06:04
Where does this millionaire info come from, citation pls? :)

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:34:07
This is sadly not possible where I live, so localbitcoins starts looking good. At least if you hare in any kind of hurry.
@_date: 2013-02-10 10:29:00
Choosing a number of hashing repetitions should make rainbow tables useless. Of course, you need to then also choose a largish number that is not easily guessable...
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:29:24
This could be fairly huge: speeding up confirmations a whole lot.
@_date: 2013-07-01 08:57:48
Its funny that the world still relies on paper bills for verification purposes. I have 0 paper bills nowadays since we went for a longer vacation and therefor use "autogiro" meaning the bills are payed automatically. We have other electronic bills that are also automatic. The only kind of paperwork I have that is useful is a tax statement, but those only come once a year, so to have one less than 2 months old can be problematic!
@_date: 2013-02-07 10:22:30
No Sweden. Although, I'm not surprised. Ive never hear of anyone buying minutes except teenagers.

And Bitstamp is leading!
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:41:13
Aaah yes, this is why copiers had to be specifically approved to copy military secrets when I worked with that. And yes, big multi-machines (fax, copier, printer) often had large red signs saying basically "Not ok for secret"
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:38:03
Thats really crappy that registrars depends on Dns. Unacceptable, really. Bitcointalk should have a much more expensive / safe certificate.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:53:58
One problem, at least for Sweden: we have recently seen *three* new mobile apps for payment: Bart (from Visa et al I think), swish (from our major banks) and wywallet (from our major telecom operators). 
The market is sort of super-saturated right now.
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:26:10
Wooh! I want a youngno flash!
@_date: 2013-02-21 09:35:13
I still remember that I solo-mined a block on my cpu... dont remember when this was but I was apparently lucky. It should have taken ~1 year and only took a few weeks. Wish I still had those bitcoins :(

Ugh, why are they using sf to host the files? I loathe sf and have for about 10 years.

Big opportunity to make some money on the rebound from the correction though.... Almost tempted...
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:23:16
Absolutely, but for the "common joe" the difference is not that great.

Tipping _is_ optional in parts of the world, you know.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:32:10
Its still way faster than a bank wire which will take days to reach an exchange. There are some other alternatives available in my country, but theyre shady and/or expensive.

That sounds like it could be fingerprinting, but maybe not I guess if Xerox were willing to fix it?

Hope theyre not evil / dont get a lot more than 50% ;)
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:18:16
Kraken has a time delay on its settings, meaning you cant change withdraw address. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:25:15
Yeah, fingerprinting is done a bit "smarter" I guess. "Lets actually change our users' documents" does not sound smart.

When I was there on vacation they changed their currency from bolivars to "bolivar forte" I think. I think they just removed zeroes though.

I found 3.2 bitcoins in a blockchain wallet that I used for some gambling on satoshi dice. I sold those quickly after realising how "much" I had. 
And to think that I once mined my own block with CPU....
