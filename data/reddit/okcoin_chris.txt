Just a few comments from me (Director of International at OKCoin):  
* OKCoin has demonstrated today that we do indeed have more than enough in reserves to cover all deposits; 104.86% to be precise  
* The method was similar to that of Stefan's audit of Bitfinex and Kraken  
* By submitting ourselves to this audit we wanted to show that we are (1) a financially sound company and (2) we operate with customers funds, trust and confidence placed at the heart of our business  
* OKCoin will be implementing a verification system on our website whereby users will be able to check whether their balance was included in the data analysed by Stefan. This will be launched soon  
* Stefan will be making his own separate statement regarding the audit  
* We fully acknowledge that this is a 'one-point-in-time' audit. It is for this reason that we aim to provide a series of regular audits (including a cash reserve audit in the future) to maintain the trust and confidence of users  
* Lastly, many thanks to Stefan for taking the time to do this for OKCoin and also the community at large

Hi Manishpan, I am not aware of your Reddit account being deleted, however let me apologize for any rudeness you received from our customer service reps. As this was a .CN support case, i was not aware of it. However, i will be personally following this complaint up for you.

Of course we could use one of these 'big 4' professional accountancy firms to audit 'fiat' funds. However, many users also want an audit of Bitcoin funds. At the moment, such firms do not have the expertise / are not comfortable auditing Bitcoin. Once they are able to audit both types, then of course we will use them

Re: Where is OKCoin looking to expand: We want to make OKCoin accessible to as many as people as possible. My job at the moment is to ensure that we are strategically best placed in each region to cater for our users. If the demand is there, we will be there.

Hi PiusX,  
* I don't think its fair to compare us to a 'bachelor drunk' (with ~100 staff, we have more tech, finance and compliance experience combined than most other Bitcoin companies).  
* I also don't really understand your logic as to why we would allow our apartment to become 'filthy' in the first place. Why not just keep the apartment clean all the time? This way we can focus our time &amp; energy on building and enhancing our products/services, rather than worrying about when 'mum and dad' will visit.  
* Yes we fully acknowledge they are all one-point-in-time views, and of course, we will continue to do everything we can in order to improve transparency, but please remember that this has to be balanced with other commercial considerations such as security, IP and competitiveness

A variety of reasons. We are well funded by notable and serious financial backers/VCs (Ceyuan, VenturesLabs, Tim Draper) to the tune of over US$10m. We have a team with a proven track record. Our tech team carries experience from Yahoo, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Baidu, Google. Our management team carry experience from investment banking, funds management and capital markets. We are very public - both online and in public (we have a real address where you can come and visit us). We have never been taken down by DDoS / Never had any significant downtime. We are about to launch a widespread expansion across the globe with an outstanding range of new product/services. Going forward, you will be seeing a lot more from us

To answer your last question: Yes we are hiring across all teams. As for the International Operations Team, we are currently recruiting for English speaking customer service staff. Our preference is for bilingual people, however if a candidate's skills/expertise can make up for it, we will consider English-only speakers. If you think you are right for the job, then please get in touch: hr

We are planning on supporting European users very very soon. Stay tuned...! SEPA will be supported
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:24:28
Please be patient. This will be added over the weekend.

Thanks Vitalik. Small and prudent steps and we will get there.

Expansion is very important to us and is a high priority at the moment. We feel we have a great core product, and we are building new products and services on top of this. We want to offer these awesome services to as many people as possible. With regards to friendly jurisdictions, there are a few countries in continental Europe that have shown a promising attitude towards digital currencies

We always look forward to meeting new and old friends at the industry conferences. We expect the Chicago conference to be a great event.

Yes absolutely, it is likely that many other states will follow suit. I think Bitcoin is still on the fringe, but it is certainly heading towards being considered mainstream. With regards to China, anything is possible!
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:43:12
Many reasons. Most VC funding. more experienced team, better UI, greater liquidity, better customer services, faster withdrawals. Our exchange has never had any 'bugs', better range of products and services.....with many more to come!
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:23:29
Of course. As long as the deposit and withdrawal are done in Bitcoin/Litecoin you are free to trade on our exchange without having to provide much more than just an email address.

Our preference is for bilingual (Chinese + English) speakers. (The three of us answering these questions are bilingual). Nevertheless, if a candidate's skills/expertise can make up for it, we would consider those who can only speak English. 
We are currently in the process of drafting the 'jobs' page for our English website. It will be published soon. 
Speaking from my own experience as head of the International Team, most of my work is actually in English, however when it comes to internal discussions (e.g. with the tech team), it certainly does help to speak Chinese.

You can now find Stefan's audit statement here: 
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:40:11
This has now been resolved. We are sincerely sorry for the delay. The problem stemmed from a number of auto-security blocks being tripped. We take security very seriously, but at the same time, we know how important it is for our traders to withdraw btc very quickly. As such, we are currently improving the way our users withdraw their Bitcoin quickly and securely.

Whilst Australia is definitely on our expansion plans, we have no plans for a physical office there in the near to mid-term
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:20:48
Yes, we are looking into this at the moment. We are looking for an auditor. Would you like to nominate somebody with notable standing in the industry?
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:02:30
Many thanks

We are always on the lookout for new coins. However, adding a new coin is not a straight forward decision. We pride ourselves on stability and reliability, and therefore would need to think it through very carefully.

Hi there,
Yes everything is fine at OKCoin. My apologies that there was quite a bit of ping-pong/back and forth going on here between you and our customer service rep. It shouldn't be this troublesome for our users. However, quite simply, when we receive verification images (such as passports / IDs and address proof), we do need to have the whole page readable; especially for passports. This is a compliance issue and not something we can just casually accept/allow through. 
I also understand you were having problems uploading your document on the site. Therefore, the manual method whereby we upload it into your account is just a backup method in case the upload function does not work for some reason.
Finally, our risk management system does block some btc withdrawals. There are set and defined reasons for this which i unfortunately cannot disclose because this relates to our own User Account security measures. Basically, when certain parameters are met, the system will flag down transactions it thinks are being conducted by a bad actor. If this happens we will need to briefly verify that you are indeed the true account holder. At OKCoin, we set the bar very high and err on the side of caution when it comes to the security of user funds. This has proven effective given that we have never lost user funds.
Have a great day,
Chris, OKCoin
