Actually this is a copypasta of my post that won't show up on It's now been almost 24 hours. Still "signing transaction".
I guess the Trezor employees over there are censoring posts. Someone prove to me otherwise.

Why are these so much better than wallet apps?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:44:46
So the devices are completely offline, I assume? Cool.. will look into them.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:36:22
So with these, do you still use 12-word seeds if you need to recover?
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:35:27
I'm going directly into USB ports on the case. I tried USB 2.0 first and I don't think it worked at all for some reason. So it's in USB 3.0.

How would you use Mycelium with one of these cold storage wallets? I currently use Mycelium.
Do you mean you'd buy/sell on Mycelium and then transfer to your cold storage wallet?

I've only had two incoming transactions, of 2.52 BTC (I went back and forth between Trezor and Mycelium wallet (not Trezor account).
@_date: 2016-08-21 19:38:33
Already tried Mycelium, as per the original post. I have a Macbook I can try. I'm pretty sure the same thing will happen.

Where's a good place to do this? I'm limited to my mobile device right now. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 06:48:17
I can't.. do this.. anymore

Whoa.. Just logged into Kraken again and it's showing a deposit of ฿1.23343! Is it just now finally showing up? So relieved. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 05:27:46
Not that I recall. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 05:49:15
I tried wiping and recovering in Luxstack. It's showing the same amount -- 1160 bits when it should be over 1 BTC. But xbalances.com shows my balance as .52 BTC.

At least use the [correct link]( Not a rip off the original.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:28:47
Okay, cool. Thanks for explaining that.
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:33:39
[I wasn't joking.](
@_date: 2016-07-30 05:42:05
Whoa there, buddy.
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:27:18
Dropped nearly $20, dawg. Yeah. Crazy
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:50:15
I'd back it up in more than one place. Your residence might burn down. That's just me, though.
