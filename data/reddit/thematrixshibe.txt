In Humanities class, we played Kahoot in class. Some of us picked funny names, and I picked `SatoshiNakamoto` (there isn't enough room for a space). I won, and the teacher asked, "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto", while holding a chocolate. I then shouted, "I AM SATOSHI NAKAMOTO!", hence the title.

For the average consumer, I'd say some luck and a bit of time will get you tons of "free" games. For example, you put in a bitcoin's worth of money when the price is low (eg $350, that wasn't too long ago). Later, the price rises (~$1000). You put that into your account, and voila! $650 from just waiting.

Dogecoin is practically entirely community. No matter how the price drops, there's tips and jokes flying everywhere. There's nothing wrong with that. It is almost inevitable. 
And [Litecoin]( That just dropped 80% of the block time and replaced SHA255d with Scrypt. You should see the proof they have that a short block time works.

I'd suggest a brain wallet tied with a simple API. Sign your TXs locally with a private key based off your passphrase and shoot it through an API.

Having the term Cryptocoin in their name makes it sound dodgy IMO. The term sounds unprofessional and like a typo you'd find on Buzzfeed or alts.

Concept is great, but like said, you need a proof reader. Some of your spelling and grammar is out of whack.
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:19:24
I agree. Why do we need a foundation? Bitcoin is **decentralized**. If enough people like our ideas for development in our code forks, they will use it.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:23:38
The Fiat team has a horse-driven cart, so I guess you're fine. Though Dogecoin has their own NASCAR, so I would be careful.

Is Bitcoin edible? Well, no, but you can buy food and drinks with it. You can buy pretty much anything with it, and making a Bitcoin wallet (think of it like a bank account) takes about 30 seconds.

I thought we all agreed Xapo / Bitpay/ insert company here != Bitcoin.

Make a wallet or extra public key for donations. Replace "publickeyhere" with the wallet public key and "qr-of-public-key.png" with an image with your QR code of the same public key.
         &lt;a href="bitcoin://publickeyhere" style="background-color: using Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;
Then for a QR code, something like this:
           &lt;span style="background-color: onclick="document.getElementById('qr').style.display='inline';"&gt;Show QR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img src="qr-of-public-key.png" id="qr" /&gt;
Clicing the "show QR" button will reveal the QR code.

If you go into the left door, you see the code, but Bitcoin crashes. If you go into the right door, you might be able to save Bitcoin.

Thanks. Also, if you are willing to put a few (hundred OR thousand) dollars into it, you can buy a money spewing (as in a dollar a day) machine which doesn't need too much maintenance (other than initial set up). Remove the bracketed parts when you tell your mother, but remember them and lie that she is losing her hearing again :3.

Or it gets mixed with another bitcake. Then you have one larger, mixed cake. And if you spend some of the cake, you have to wait for the blockchain to give the rest of it back.
