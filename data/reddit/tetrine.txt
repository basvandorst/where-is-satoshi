Fuck this shitty ass platform.  Cannot get my coins out to another wallet fast enough.  This is the last I will be using CB/GDAX as a fiat entry point.  Hello, Gemini.

XRP exchange wallets were undergoing maintenance a while ago.

I got registered there pretty quick.  Good luck.

I don't hop around coins, but thanks for the incorrect assumptions.  I won't be crying about anything, the only one crying here is you about "corruption omg!"

I've been "following" Apple stock since before you were born, doesn't mean I'm a millionaire.  Have to be in it to win.

When I had a seriously delayed wire many weeks back, I actually called them.  It was complete horse shit.  The rep knew nothing, I was polite but firm in my questions.  She actually hung up on me, and then sent an email saying she was "sorry we got disconnected" to cover her ass.  If she has my account (verified and active for a long time) right in front of her, and she has time to send an email, why didn't she just call me back -- since they had asked for a callback number in case we got disconnected... Seriously, absolutely pathetic.  I had also spoken to the bank they use to receive wires, they had a MUCH more complete story about what was happening and were extremely helpful.  When I move these coins it'll be the last I ever interact with CB/GDAX.  I was just buying some for my dad actually who thought it'd be fun to get in on some crypto after hearing me talk about it so much!  Jeez.

I humbly recommend buying LTC if you're just looking for entry in a major coin to flip into an altcoin, faster transfers across the blockchain.  My BTC xfer took over 11 hours, I just did an LTC xfer in 24 minutes.

What you may not realize is LTC/BTC/ETH on Coinbase/GDAX are a fiat entry point into the major coins that users want to then turn around and quickly send to another secondary exchange in order to buy other coins not on CB/GDAX... So, we are watching value plummet on the purchase we don't actually want to hold, but wanted to "instantly" move over and swap into an altcoin.

Great stat, but....The increase from 1k to 2k is a 100% increase.  But from 9k to 10k is only around an 11% increase, so of course it takes far less time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:02
That isn't what my calculation said at all.  I agree it's moving at a great clip, but the stat is a bit misleading if you don't consider percent change.

No that's a software wallet... it's a piece of software.  Hardware wallet is something like Trezor or Nano Ledger.

Coinbase is only for ETH LTC BTC.  You need to use another exchange.

i believe it's only possible on coinbase.  gdax needs a funded account in order to buy, whereas coinbase will do a buy and lock the price while it goes to your bank account and ACH transfer the funds over.  
this isn't clear to a lot of people! don't feel bad.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:57
omg no, don't withdraw from 401k. the penalties!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:12
if you buy bitcoin using bank details and wait for ACH transfer to clear on coinbase, you have locked in purchase price.  if you are waiting on money transfer from your bank to coinbase so that you can then buy btc, you have locked in nothing and bought nothing.

For the CME Group, Bitcoin futures contracts will be cash settled. This is to say that if one were to buy a Bitcoin contract and held until expiration, no one would send 5 bitcoin (BTC) to one's bitcoin wallet. Instead, CME Group has decided to calculate the reference rate of bitcoin indexed to US dollars (using a basket of common exchanges). If the contract is above the price when one bought in, one will receive the difference in dollars (times five, of course, for the five coins). And the reverse holds for the reverse case. The reason for this cash settled approach is likely the long string of hacked exchanges in the cryptocurrency world, from Mt. Gox to Bitfinex. If the CME group were to settle the contracts with bitcoin, then they would expose themselves to this risk.
