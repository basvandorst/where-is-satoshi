So then you're assuming the reason you were denied is because of bitcoin. Good luck with your business, I hope you can read up on customer acquisition and representation of your business online sometime. Have a great day.
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:10:02
There's a ton of people that sell bottled water, you just have to do it better than the other guy! That's business.

I think the best option is to have it still take your card info which is tied to your account. They could have you slide your card then click "pay with BTC" which would make a qr code appear on screen with the amount to send. Once it receives the payment it gives the discs. That way if you keep for longer than one night the rest is charged to your card. Probably the easiest way to do this on their end and the best option for them to feel comfortable that they won't get ripped off.

Thanks! I was hoping it meant 60% discount on rent if you're a part of their advertising that you're paying rent in bitcoin. :( 
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:20:47
So if bitcoin isn't financial, then bitcoin isn't the reason you were denied a twitter ad. Solved your own problem there.
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:35:45
Receive them without mining or exchanging? So selling a good/service to get bitcoin?
I've done that before. Selling things on the various markets and got paid in bitcoin. Then I used that bitcoin to buy things for myself. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:26:14
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:16:53
Agree, awesome find. Wish they sold as well.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:33:24
Please also point out to me in this screenshot as well where it says specifically the reason you were denied was because of "bitcoin" and not because of anything else.
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:26:32
True. But if one car crashes you only pay out ~$30,000 to fix that one car. If one exchange crashes, the insurance company could look at paying out ~$3,000,000+ right?
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:55:50
Are you sure it was because the "bitcoin" not the "gold," "silver," and "4gold" portions? The "4gold" sounds like one of those "Cash4Gold" places that I can see why twitter would not want them advertising.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:51:02
I did the exact same thing. I've searched cities I know have amtrak options when searching through flights but I can't find anything. All these people talking about it... has anyone actually tried to use it yet? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:09:23
Ha, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:05:32
I used to work for a store and one time a cashier accepted a fake $100 bill. The store was out the merchandise and the money. 




@_date: 2014-05-06 17:57:49
The more people involved the longer it would take to get your money back. What's the traffic like at this place? What's the BTC scene in your area? Would people use the machine? What are the fees on the machine? How many will you allow to invest and at what amount? All good questions to answer.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:36:31
Exactly. Why not use the list on yelp to send the businesses a simple "we accept bitcoin" sticker and leave out anything related to yelp at all?
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:14:39
Reports from a bunch of different exchanges, or at least all of the ones you can implement. Rather than just one exchange and calling it good.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:05:16
That doesn't make any sense at all. If one day he said "I *only* accept bitcoin" the customers that paid by paypal, etc. before would just stop buying and find somewhere else to buy. It's stupid to only accept bitcoin unless your customers are already only paying with bitcoin. You're just stopping business and losing money if you do that.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:59:31
I just set that up the other day. I haven't seen very many people tip here. If I'm not too late it would be cool to get some.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:49:51
Yeah I got your message. I had to go to my bank to show verification for my account, and then even more verification when setting up a business account.
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:33:20
Wow... I'm not even really sure what to say.
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:45:59
If it makes you feel any better I took his comment to be humorous. I guess you don't feel the same.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:31:17
For about $20 you can go have a custom stamp made instead of spending days carving a potato to say "bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:23:22
I don't really trade *much* now so I don't have any additions but I would like as many as possible. Whenever I am trading I like to know what all the markets are doing. It seems every ticker I've ever seen just picks one exchange and that is a good indication of the price but doesn't tell you what the whole market is doing.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:55:53
So did he trademark it to protect it and allow use for all, or did he actually trademark it and defend that in Japan?
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:27:16
Hey OP. I realize this is a smaller amount but it wont be safe to buy from here. Scammers will see that you're new to this and take advantage of you. 
If you still need help on how to safely buy, not on reddit, PM me and I'd be glad to help.
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:19:03
Widespread consumer adoption needs things like this. A lot of people don't want to "be their own bank" but would use bitcoin if it were easier to use. 
Example being; I needed to send ~$150 to a family member. Bank transfer was going to be ~$10. My options were paypal or a check in the mail. If I could just send BTC to have them receive then run to an ATM in town and get cash I would've done that.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:28:07
The only problem with this is they would need to charge you $20+ upfront to cover the entire cost of DVD + case. I wouldn't pay that, especially if I was getting more than one movie.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:57:55
Exactly. He didn't even want treatment at first. He was just going to let it go, but he wanted the money for the family.
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:08:57
Oh it's your first (larger) link karma. How cute. You're right, suffer through it. Suffer alone in your awkwardness of now advertising for a machine you don't even like that much.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:36:42
Atleast you plan to support these businesses if they accept it. It's not a great idea to call every random business you can find. 
"Do you accept bitcoin?"
"We're thinking about it, would you use that as a payment option?"
"...oh, no... I don't ever plan to shop at your store, some guy on reddit just told me to call places."
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:27:13
You probably shouldn't tell people who are brand new to bitcoin that they will make money in 6 months like it's a fact.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:48:32
What's wrong with bitcoin.org? I'm not *much* involved with bitcoin as of yet. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:11:37
But res :(
@_date: 2014-04-17 07:26:25
Is this really a thing? An article on another website about subreddit drama? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:15:19
IRS claiming property or not I was under the impression ATM operators all had MSB licenses to operate these machines (where required). I don't see why they couldn't use their existing MSB license for the "bank" part of it. That said in many states you don't need your own MSB license if the only money transmitting you do is for a company that already has their own MSB license. I would think Robocoin could let the ATM owners operate under their company and licensing. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:23:30
Okay. That makes a lot of sense.
I guess now I would ask, if that is true, why aren't robocoin machines in the USA yet? It seems there are a lot of these machines around but what, like only 2 in Texas? Why haven't they spread across the country?
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:44:02
I guess. I had to go to my bank and show 3 forms of verification just for an account. Then when I set up a business checking account I had to show 5 forms of verification in person. I guess I just bank with a bunch of assholes? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:35:45
Exactly what I was thinking. It's not good for anything. Anyone who actually knows anything about bitcoin will laugh at your website.
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:18:29
When everyone stops using other forms of currency?
@_date: 2014-04-29 08:51:35
Awesome. Thank you very much. I appreciate the tip and help.
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:26:42
But this isn't millions (yet). 
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:57:44
Check office supply stores near you. If you go into an actual store sometimes they can be made in less than 24 hours or even while you wait. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:53:37
Please send me all of yours and your families worthless pieces of paper. I will forward you an address to ship to.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:11:09
I would go to bitcoin.org and watch the video explaining what bitcoin is... Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:59:45
Then do it? You just keep commenting how awkward you are and how you want to delete it. If you feel awkward delete it. It's not that weird though. The picture itself is fine, and of course the company is going to represent themselves (whether it's weird or not) because they have a reddit presence.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:41:39
Serious question, are you a business owner? It's a common thing among small business owners to try to avoid yelp as much as you possibly can.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:53:28
Can you do anything with the gift code now though? It's already in his account. Will it let you take the last $7.54 left? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:05:48
But they might think you're a "Cash4Gold" place and you're trying to buy gold with cash. I would guess buying gold with cash is a restricted financial product to twitter.
I'm just saying your title assumes that all of twitter is completely against bitcoin but all you really know is that your profile was restricted from advertising due to some vague claim.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:28:37
Did twitter say to you they denied you due to "bitcoin" anywhere? They could've denied you for a number of reasons but you assume because you were denied it was because of bitcoin and twitter in it's entirety is against bitcoin.
In the business world everyone is a customer. I've never once bashed you, I'm just discussing with you that you could've been denied for any reason. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:14:18
But everything bitcoin is safe, right? There's never any record of people losing bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:53:04
He deleted all of his comments and the whole thread. What do we do now? :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:25:32
You literally said it wasn't a financial product yourself. So if it's not a financial product then they denied you due to another financial product.
Also, you sure know how to gain customers around here, huh?
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:56:39
I don't think anyone will ever install a bitcoin anything chrome extension. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:22:21
Did you completely miss the giant title that says  "USA Today Weekend"?
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:23:28
Alright, I give up. I can't find amtrak anywhere on cheapair's website. Where do I go to look for bookings?
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:20:09
I downloaded Bitcoin-QT by recommendation for a wallet. I've let it run for days at a time and it's never fully synched up ever. Is there a better local wallet I can be using? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:43:36
Not sure what you're talking about but again; representation of your business online would be an excellent topic for you to study. I wish you all the best.
Also maybe, "how to not act like a child on the internet." Great read.
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:13:12
Really. Also people very interested in the serious part of alt-coins almost always find their way to bitcoin eventually. It's like a starting step to get up to the level of understanding how to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:32:01
Please point out to me in the screenshot where it says "You were denied because of bitcoin" I must be missing that part. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:22:48
Well seeing as you'll lose a large majority of your traffic to kraken, good luck.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:15:12
No I don't work for twitter but I would venture to bet other people who do things related to bitcoin have advertised there.
They don't have a person read through your website, twitter profile, and facebook page then determine you're not eligible to advertise. It's automatic. It probably picked on on your use of "gold" and "silver" and the "4gold" part which are all very similar to those "Cash4Gold" places that used to exist which would buy peoples old jewelry and pay cash. I can imagine twitter would not want that type of advertising there so it automatically flagged your account as not eligible. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:49:25
What is this?


I couldn't find any mention of bitcoin on their website.
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:37:18
I guess. All I'm paying for is the trademarked term to use though, right? Because I don't feel like I know nearly enough about bitcoin to help other people safely use it and yet I got 86%. So technically I could pay and call myself a "Certified consultant" right? I'm not sure anyone should trust me with a large amount of their bitcoin though...
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:17:02
So then who would offer the insurance? If a third party was insuring something they had no control over the fee to pay for the insurance would be a lot higher.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:46:47
But the insurance would have to be offered by the exchange itself. No other company would insure the exchange because they couldn't guarantee anything about their safety. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:22:25
Your account was denied due to "restricted *financial* products" and you just said bitcoin wasn't *financial* so then that isn't the reason why you were denied.
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:42:44
Nope. I've only done it a few times because I don't sell that often but I've bought 2 or 3 things with bitcoin. I've never cashed out anything I've received though. Everything I get from selling I keep.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:38:00
The only problem I see is the users would have to pay for this insurance. Like health insurance, car insurance, etc. If this company is insuring an exchange that could be a lot of money. So how much would this insurance cost? 
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:38:31
Maybe it should just say "bitcoin.org" and maybe a short message about what bitcoin is if they've never heard of it. I think it would be better for people to land on a page explaining it rather than land on a page to buy it if they have no idea what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:35:19
Thank you for the tip Mr. Ant Raper
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:59:28
Picture looked cool. This makes it sound like a scam. Is this a real thing? Is the "certification" actually valuable or worthless?
Edit: Took the quiz. I think I answered my own question.
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:10:31


@_date: 2014-04-19 17:48:46
I mean I go to the ATM (conveniently located at the bank) to withdraw/deposit but I also had to go to the bank to set up the account... So I've been to my bank before. Just surprised me that he's **never** been to the bank at all. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:25:11
He got downvoted when he posted this to dogecoin so he came here to cry hoping everyone else would circlejerk with him about how every other coin is going to fail because it's not bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:11:50
This dude bitches about bitcoin atm's in every thread. No point in arguing with him anymore.
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:28:03


Well... that's probably why the tips aren't busting down your door.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:28:16
You've never gone to the bank? So you've never used cash at all? 
Edit: The bank I use only has ATM's at the bank near me. So..
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:02:54
But haven't you heard about their stories? For every business that has been helped by good yelp reviews I've heard 5 who want to cry because they now have to pay something they can't afford to keep their reviews up. There's no denying a great set of reviews on yelp can make your business more successful, tons of people still use the site. But I have heard too many stories to ever want to support or use it myself.
