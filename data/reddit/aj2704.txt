Is this an intervention? Of course I can. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:52:00
Google Assistant does, too. Maybe wait another year for Apple to follow suit. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:44:26
I think I get enough updates on here. Don't need to Google Bitcoin news. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:23:28
Been cost averaging since July, 17 :) I still don't have 1 BTC, but I'm hoping to get there. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:11:28
Yay, thx. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:05:10
They did because of the LRS. There are certain policies when it comes to remitting foreign currency, like USD. Buying Bitcoin, unfortunately, isn't one of them.

Is there no difference between a casino and an arcade center? Arcade centers have those games, with the basketball, and the bowling alley. Casino, on the other hand, are completely different. They give out money, if you win. You win tokens in an arcade. Because, where I stay, gambling is illegal, and hence casino houses are too. Arcade centers aren't.

I use Bitcoin to pay for my VPN service. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:44:27
Seems like you were trying to buy it from an overseas exchange, to arbitrage or whatever reasons. Under the LRS scheme, there's no provisions which legally allows you to buy Bitcoin. It's part of the remittance scheme. Use a debit card instead.

Go CAAAVS. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:38:56
I did, not a dud. It's not there. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:18:03
How can you tell? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:56:44
My fees was around $1.2 for me to transfer $40 worth Bitcoin. I think that's cheap. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:15:21
I think it's stupid. I am from India, and I can tell you that alot of people are putting money in Bitcoin. It's fine if they don't own one full BTC, people don't want to miss out. The demand is that much higher here, and a limited number of good exchanges, maybe 5? Makes the price what it is right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:29:49
As far as I know, they are. I know someone from a remote village here who mortgaged his land to put around 50 lacs. And I can assure you that he has no idea how and what are the fundamentals of blockchain technology. So if he is doing it, then you can imagine the frenzy. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:44:10
I'd send you a picture, if there was a way. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:46:19
Zebpay charges around 480 to 500 bits as network fees. What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:09:57
There's no regulation as such. So it's not illegal. Probably by 2018 March, there might be an enactment. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:48:45
Hey! I really don't have much, but I'll try to send some. How much do you need? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:45:03
I paid a transfer fees of 1000 bits to transfer something as low as 0.01. Their verification process is easy and quick, but the fees are absolutely crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:03
I don't think so. I am a little panaroid about posting any addresses here. Was trying to post a picture of the email chain my exchange sent me, unfortunately I can't post a picture in this thread. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:55:46
It's the demand and supply. They are trying to catch up with the price in the US, but I think people are holding back from buying now that it hit 10,00,000 INR. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:17:09
!money 1 XBT INR
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:56:23
Hahaha. I think they've already stated that. Would you be surprised if they declare it to be illegal and ban all the exchanges from providing services? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:02:02
Okay, so if I am regularly transferring from my bank account into an exchange, that won't be a concern if it's not above the amount you mentioned? And I don't plan on selling, just buying and transferring the coins into my wallet. So if per say, the value goes down, and I don't actually make any profit, I shouldn't be liable to pay any tax. That is correct, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:54
Haha, man I am not going to try and convince you any further. I got my transaction confirmed, with a low fee and less amount of time. I am happy. I posted this here considering this sub was going crazy with transaction time/fees. This was an upside. :)

That was somewhere around September. So I am sure he must have gotten his money back now. 
I've tried using Localbitcoins, but never really got a reply from the seller's. It seems shady, at least where I stay. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:44:53
Coinmama and Cex.io let's you verify almost from anywhere. But their fees are almost crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:45:11
I was trying cash, just for the sake of it. Never got a reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:18
 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:26:14
So if I am an exchange, I wouldn't want that to happen, right? Cause then I'll be going out of business. 
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:30:27
Could you give me yours? I'd like to try sending some.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:58:34
It gives me an error saying that the payment path is unavailable.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:25:16
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:31:52
Thanks for this. I use Bitcoin to buy my VPN subscription. Other than that, haven't found a lot of places where I can use it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:53:31
What about a foreign USD card? Those travel card. They don't charge any fees as such, so the only charges I'd be paying is the exchange fees. How do I get verified in one of the exchange? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:16:37
Unfortunately, in India, the price never went down to a whole lot. It came to about $6600 in major wallets here, and it's been trading at over $7000 since a few days. There wasn't any significant dip, to buy a good amount. Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:50:41
In India, there aren't alot of options. Been using it since the first time, fees used to be pretty minimal, it rose now. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:58:14
How? The verification process and everything?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:03:49
Coinbase converts the price in US to INR. Look at the wallets/ exchanges here. Zebpay is at 617,000 INR. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:23:09
2.5% profit is definitely not worth the hassle. Which exchange/wallet do you use to buy from, here? I am from India as well. 
Plus, I don't think I can buy from a US exchange, the conversion rate will kill me. Bank's rate of conversion would be around 67/68 and then service charge. So to actually make a profit, I'd have to get someone to do it there, so you're right about that. 
There's gotta be a way. Sending back USD would attract the same amount of fees? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:24:36
I've been trying to get on any other exchange, than what we have here, but it's impossible. You can't get verified. You can't list your bank details. Such a shame. Apparently they buy from people and sell to us. The demand is higher, it seems. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:34:09
Zebpay. That's only in India, I believe. You can't change the fees and they charge 100 S/ Bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:51:08
It'd be pretty hypocritic of the Government to ban Bitcoin. Since the whole demonetisation movement in India, the Government has been urging people to use digital mode of payment. Buying Bitcoin through cash should be something of a concern, otherwise, all of us have to use our bank to transfer money into wallets. 
Well, but then again, India is known to adopt regulations and laws of that of another country. So they might just follow where the US stands on cryptocurrencies, or something like China? 
Just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:54:34
I don't think the price spread being evening out is an issue. I say this because, when there was a dip around the world, Bitcoin in India, in major wallets and exchanges, was still trading around $6600. So there was a difference of $1100. The only issue is that I'd need to verify and be able to put money in an exchange overseas. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:30:06
Any basis for your argument? Cause they are coming down pretty hard on "virtual currencies". 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:35:24
What. What is the project? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:11:27
**Indian Government**: YOU SEE WHAT *VIRTUAL CURRENCY* IS MAKING OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICALS DO. THATS WHY ITS BAD. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:07:22
I am surprised all of this is happening at the time when they are already pushing for elections. First you demonetise currencies, then ask the citizens to use the fintech companies for payment, and then you decide to do this. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:03:28
Yeah, well. They are going to blame Bitcoin anyway. I am from India, this is pretty much how they function. Can't curbe the black money? Demonitize the currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:58:44
Seems like it. They filed a complaint/ FIR against one of the personnel. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:18:22
I've keep checking. I thought my coinbase was broken. It's already past 9k
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:00:44
