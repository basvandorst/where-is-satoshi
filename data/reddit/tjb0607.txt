Does this include all the temporary and junk addresses that currently don't contain any Bitcoin? Most people use lots of different addresses, especially when it's automated by a website.

with such a quick hash algorithm and without a salt or anything, 6-10 random digits is fucking nothing.
Remember that this is going to an entirely *public* hash database, the same as if a website you were using was hacked and the password database leaked.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:39:20
If you watch more of his video, [he touches on why]( ~40 bits of entropy (about the amount of entropy in a truly random 6-character password typable on a qwerty keyboard) isn't anywhere near enough, because botnets can probably check around 2^48 passwords per day, enough to find every single 6-character password possible, hundreds of times over.
This is why passphrases should be properly salted, and put through a more demanding hash algorithm, before turned into a bitcoin address.

this wasn't even implemented on the official core branch from what I can tell though, I don't see how this is a big deal

be sure all of said "sensitive browsing" is over https - Tor exit nodes see every bit of data going back and forth over http (but obviously can't mitm https)

Here's the transaction:

Yes. Also, referring people can increase your reward based on how much they deposit. It doesn't even have to be a different person, you can even refer yourself, and you get infinite referral links. Referring someone doesn't do anything unless they deposit bitcoins. The referral system is just a way to advertise the company.

nice, yeah.
For some reason 2D porn is 100% fine and dandy to pay for via paypal, but as soon as the picture was made with some kind of camera, it's suddenly a huge fucking deal that paypal needs to prevent from happening.
I've read several horror stories of sex workers' accounts being frozen literally just for being in the sex industry, without ever using paypal to sell anything porn-related.

Nope, not sure how I can prove it but I've never been affiliated with them in any way.
And it's relatively not too expensive. Most of Deep Medi &amp; Tempa releases of 2 songs are $1.93, minus the Bitcoin discount, which is cheaper than if I were to buy the same thing from Amazon in 256kbps mp3. And that's for flac, which usually costs more than MP3. (like on Surus, an mp3 is usually $1.26, but flac is $1.89)
I just love this website because it has precisely the kind of music I like, cheaper than what most other (legal) places offer for flac. And of course, because Bitcoin. It's obviously not for everyone, it's more targeted for people that are into deep dubstep, drum and bass, and whatever other music they have. Especially those who prefer high quality formats (wav/flac).

I enjoy it on a 75W subwoofer I got for $7 at a garage sale, but it's a small bedroom and the subwoofer is always right next to me, so I said 200W just to be safe with room size and all that. Also, 200W will blow you away, while ~100W will merely bring some enjoyment.

Actually, this website has quite a few middle men.
When you make a purchase, it goes through BitPay, which then sends the money to Digital Tunes' bank account, and then it's given to the record label, where they pay the artist. So it's not too different from other services in that sense.

Nope, even if we had 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 THash/s, the same amount of bitcoins are issued per day, and the network won't generate bitcoins more quickly. Bitcoins will automatically become harder to mine to make up for the increased mining power.

1/((33/58)^(33)) = 120 826 938.5 tries, actually. 33 is the total number of characters after the '1', while 33/58 is the probability of a single character being uppercase. The average doesn't matter when calculating the probability. 120 million is really small and easy to calculate, though.
