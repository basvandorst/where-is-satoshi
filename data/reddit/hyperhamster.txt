It probably would, but after silk road closed down there was a new DPR and a silk road 2.0.  There was lots of ongoing drama with regards to the new DPR iirc, so maybe he deserves his own bullet point.

Exactly, if they'd just been like "welp, we've lost all the bitcoin, lets stop everything and work out where we stand" then they could have saved alot of people alot of money.  Even if they only realised a few weeks ago, there was still money going into gox trying to grab those $100 coins, plus there was bitcoinbuilder.

I'm sure you could afford a satoshi, they're at $0.000006483 ;)

Bitcoin is extremely volatile and has crashed plenty of times already, and the press have mentioned this quite alot in the past.  It didn't destroy it then.

You sound like a lovely chap to hang out with.

No, it's today

This how free markets work.  With Bitcoin people have the power, if they bother to analyse the information they have available to them.
Just alot of people dont understand this and jump into bitcoin expecting the same consumer rights that they get when they buy a product, like a tv or something.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:37:56
Ahhh I see, I apologise.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:20:46
Started using them today, really enjoying it so far!
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:33:42
Huh? VAT is applied to goods and services anyway, why should it be any different if you're using bitcoin as opposed to bitcoin?

8% is pretty reasonable

Spread the idea that bitcoin is less safe than it is, people are more likely to buy insurance on their bitcoins.

Except for the fact this happened in two different countries.
And 3 in a week doesn't mean 3 every week.  And your numbers don't make any sense!
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:40:51
Definitely.  I've been so unproductive lately, for the last month i've been absolutely glued to bitcoin, its been a crazy ride!
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:27:50
I reckon you could get away with it in quite a lot of countries that arent the US.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:42:45
YES! I use scan for almost all my computer stuff, if you keep an eye out on their 'today only' page they have some pretty decent deals.

Even if they weren't making a shit ton of money, Karpeles could easily have sold MtGox for a very large sum of money, plus he had alot of Bitcoins himself.  I doubt he's pulling a fast one just to get away with a load of coins, and risk prison or worse in the process.

Same, I would sell most of my holdings if this happened.

No! Wait until the next popcorn correction.

Noones said they're magical. But selling OTC will have a very small amount of slippage vs dumping them all into a fraction of available liquidity.

It is a global currency, but the US has the largest economy in the world so it will likely have an effect
