weak hands
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:41:58
you regret not selling at 19k
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:16:38
I see it as a safe haven.
Look at what happened after BREXIT, Gold and Bitcoin both shot up.
Another 2008 is just around the corner, that's the main reason I'm so bullish on Bitcoin

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:49:35
The herd is coming
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:08:29
Are you saying they're going to add the Top 30 marketcap coins?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:28:03
I don't think young immature money is pushing this up. Big players and institutions are
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:01
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:22:35
scarcity and no one is selling
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:28:37
Profit taking at $1300 for sure
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:07:00
Congratulations, you've just won the lottery 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:09:58
You should have waited. We'll see the price come down after $1,300 USD is achieved 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:55:57
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:09:13
What the fuck did I just read
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:38:23
Buy the Dips my friend, you're still an early adopter and will be rewarded in the long run
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:35:57
I was in the same position a few months ago, bought Siacoin, Augur, Icononi, Ethereum and Golem.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:42:54
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:37:09
Yes, however nothing happens when I connect the ledger to my desktop USB. am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:18:31
he's such a retard
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:42:15
been following [this]( but nothing happens when I connect
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:33:07
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:30:20
Clever scam
@_date: 2016-11-09 03:39:52
USD is losing a lot of value at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 04:15:17
The Dollar is losing value. Money will pour into Gold/Silver and Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-28 13:23:10
I use Virwox to buy Linden Dollars, then I convert to BTC
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:16:33
this site ripped me off in the past. fake site
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:29:17
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:40:37
It's going a lot lower, I'll pick up more at $4800
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:40
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:04
The whole HODL mentality is so dumb
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:18:49
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:23:38
hmmmmm 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:33:36
BCH isn't as bad as this sub makes out.
I can personally see it going over $2000 short term
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:43:01
Bitcoin is full, go away
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:44:42
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:09:09
Yes you should, parabolic trend isn't coming to a halt yet
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:40:41
Oh FFS
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:45:02
On a serious note, just buy in. A little bit every week will do, this isn't going away.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:42:00
Bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:29:06
Yeah we're going much lower
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:27:59
my personal prediction is a correction shortly after $10k down to around $6400
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:43:43
Just keep adding Bitcoin. With altcoins you're really taking a big chance
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:55:48
get a xapo card and use BTC everywhere
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:19:31
We're going sub $1800, be prepared to get some very cheap coins
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:27:40
keep it obviously
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:11:03
Stop wasting your time, no one knows what direction we're going in short-term
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:58:59
You should have waited, big correction coming
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:09:33
We're going lower, hold out before buying
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:09:33

@_date: 2017-10-25 17:19:37
couldn't agree more, Bitcoin will never be a currency you use for day to day transactions
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:30:39
If something seems to good to be true it probably is. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:51:05
he's a hack, called for $100,000 silver per Oz not too long ago
@_date: 2016-10-09 16:20:49
The price doesn't concern me either, All my savings go into Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-23 23:41:08
This looks really cool
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:46:12
Buy at the ATH? That's not a shrewd business move if you ask me
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:57:36
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:05:18
I use preev.com
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:27:53
seems like a scam
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:22:55
Doesn't the blockchain run on top of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:30:06
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:04:01
sometimes you just gotta learn the hard way.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:00:34
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:11:03
I think we'll hit $4000 before we see the next dip
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:35:29
Drawing lines on a chart isn't going to predict anything my friend
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:23:51
[Oh look Bitcoin is crashing again] (
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:26:25
thanks for the shitpost
