I've ordered twice from them and both times it was instant but I have a Coinbase account so I'm sure that helps. It even asks me for two factor authentication since I have that enabled at Coinbase. Pretty cool! Never used Overstock for anything before this but now I always check them first to see if they have what I want.

I have a feeling they DO use some of them and the ones they have no infrastructure for get pre-sold for an obscene markup. Of course, they then delay shipment until their private mining farms have run their course.

I thought the whole deal with offline wallets was that you couldn't (or shouldn't) spend from them more than once. How does this get around that?

Hyperinflation and collapse of the dollar is what will usher in the era of Bitcoin and begin the migration out of central bank issued fiat currencies. People will buy coins because they believe them to be a better store of value than whatever fiat currency they have. People that sell things will start accepting it as payment once they realize consumer purchasing power is mostly sequestered in Bitcoins. People will spend coins once they are accepted at places that sell things they want. Until then, Bitcoin will limp along as the playground of speculators and early adopters and price volatility will continue.

Spending will still exist, what changes is the value proposition in spending vs saving whatever discretionary income you have. If a currency, because it's deflationary, makes it a better value proposition to save some higher proportion of your discretionary income than you would have under an inflationary system then you Win under that system and all you had to do was learn to delay gratification. If some companies lose out under this system then it's because their product  could be regarded as non-essential, something you want rather than something you need. So deflation hammers non-essential goods and services and this causes that PART of the economy to contract...so what.
