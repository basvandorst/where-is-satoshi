Ouch... same one I use.  :(
Be sure to post back here if you figure out what happened, and hopefully someone else will hop in here with some useful info.  Sadly though I have tried to start a couple real conversations on bitcoin recently that got no traction... they all just want to talk about how much it is or isn't worth instead of any real conversations on it's usage.

Well damn... nice that I got a few up votes but some sort of discussion  would have been nice.  I guess all anyone wants to discuss right now is the value of bitcoin, not how it can be spread or better utilized by merchants.  Oh well.

I feel for you and have no helpful advice but one part of your comment struck me.  You did not back up because it "only 4 days old"?  Dude... seriously, in this day and age with all the auto backup tech out there you should be auto-backing up every hour, not randomly once a week or so.  You did not lose much this time, but not having an active auto-backup plan in place is going to bite you hard in the ass down the road.  Take this small loss of bitcoin as a motivation to fix that situation as soon as possible.
Now that said, the issue you described is certainly worrisome and I wonder if anyone else out there has seen such an issue before?  Which bitcoin wallet app were you using?

That might be an option, but I was hoping there might be a marketplace that already existed with built in support and which advertised it's support of bitcoins.  Because that really is the only way you can drive more people to make purchases this way.  If not, then this is a great opportunity for someone out there...

"... it's far easier just to keep up with whatever the current exchange rate is."
Is it?  I have been trying to do my research as I consider accepting BTC for my custom glassware, but as an individual artisan who is busy making my work, staying up to date on daily fluctuations that lately at least have been pretty dramatic... I have not yet come across a feasible artisan marketplace that will auto-calculate BTC/USD conversion rates so that I can ensure I am getting a fair price for my work.  That is the only thing keeping me from accepting BTC as a merchant.

Thanks for the replies, I will definitely go look at BitPay.
