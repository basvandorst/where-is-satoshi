I think we haven't yet grasped how much Google can find out about you if they have access to your car GPS data for every trip. They'll know if you shop at Wal-Mart or eat at expensive fancy restaurants, how often you go to the gym, if you have children you drop off at school, if you to church on Sundays, where you go on vacation and what you do there... You get the picture. In aggregate, all that data can be very powerful for completing their profile of you.
It's actually scary.

You should have been around to see the Internet in 1995. The Internet was incredibly geeky and hard to use, and you couldn't do that much with it anyway beyond sending email, downloading files and looking at ugly web pages.
[This article]( is a screencap summary of [this program]( that is trying to tell people that the Internet is not geeky and that you can do stuff with it. But look how geeky it is and how little you can do. 
Only 20 years ago, popular sentiment had no clue of what the Internet would become. Most people had barely heard of it. And a couple of years before that it was even worse. Browsing was all text based and you had to use keyboard commands to get around, exactly like the first bitcoin client we saw a few years ago.

**TL;DR: After realizing how insecure brain wallets can be with the wrong sort of passphrase, I got thinking if it would be possible to set up a benevolent distributed hacking network that tests random addresses and covertly alerts people if their brain wallet has been breached.**
I've been thinking quite a bit about brain wallet security, after another reddit post led me to [this one about a brain wallet disaster]( After a bit more reading on bitcointalk, the takeaway was that [what might be a secure password for other things]( is dangerous for a brainwallet because the entropy is not enough to withstand a dictionary attack. 
**The scariest thing is that by hashing out brain wallet passphrases and trying to swipe any funds out of each private key generated, hackers can basically target all brain wallets at one go, making it much more potentially profitable.** 
As more people (and people with less experience) use Bitcoin, we will probably see a significant rise in people having their funds stolen out of inadequately secure brain wallets.
Would it be possible to set up a benevolent distributed hacking network that tests random addresses and covertly alerts people if their brain wallet has been breached?
I was thinking of creating a separate reddit post (and probably still will do so), but thought I'd drop the idea here since we're on the subject.
Below is a very rough proposal of how such a vigilance system might work:
Assumption: such a hacking network will coordinate with (or oblige) the Bitcoin devs to fill the default 80 character message with random characters, rather than an empty string.
1) Hacking network constantly tries to crack private keys with a dictionary attack using a determined search space and max number of words, and other parameters that can be adjusted in complexity as the network grows.
2) When a valid private key is found, a small (but not conspicuously insignificant) transaction is made and warning message encrypted with the same private key (thus only readable to the owner and indistinguishable on the blockchain) is placed in the 80 char field.
3) When a brain wallet user notices a transaction that they have not made, they can decrypt the message with their private key and realize that their funds have been compromised.
Ideally, this would be implemented as part of the bitcoin mining network, but I can't think of a way to compensate miners for the task as any amount you could ethically swipe is likely to be far too little for the trouble. At this point I'm thinking this will have to be a 100% pro bono thing, kind of like the curing cancer computation systems.

Creating a dependent class or not all depends on how you use the aid money. I do know of Andreas' BTC remittances drive and that's great, but like you're saying, remittances probably won't ultimately solve the underlying problems.  
I've worked in developing countries and have personally seen irregular immigrant workers come back home and squander their earnings on all kinds of stuff, rather than use the money to start a business. I'm not judging them. Suddenly being "rich" is not an easy thing to handle. Still, many times, owning a few cows or a little shop is the only really difference between families that are managing and those that are not. There's a lot of educating work to be done.
On the other hand, it you pay locals to do work, start businesses and improve their community, you could gradually build a local Bitcoin economy, with much of the same money circulating in it and sustaining the economy. Maybe something like  adapted for Bitcoin (particularly as regards not denominating any loans in BTC) could be an idea.

Great analysis, Cameron! However, maybe you should think a little deeper about the implications of coin validation. 
If a central entity can invalidate bitcoins and make them unusable, that's no different from a central bank's power to recall money and it will destroy the trustless nature of Bitcoin. Who will police this entity? How will governments be prevented from infiltrating this entity, taking over, and shutting down projects like Wikileaks by confiscating their bitcoins, for example? And besides, by the time you track down bitcoins and declare them invalid they may have already been through one or more transactions and in the hands of innocent people.
Coin validation won't be Bitcoin 2.0, but something more like Fiat 2.0.

When we say one investment surpasses another, it means that it gives a better return than the other. In other words, for an equal sum invested at a given time, the total value of the first investment is worth more than that of the second at a later time when they are compared. One investment is better relative to the other.
The words "as an investment" make it clear that what is being compared is the investment potential of each. From your first comment, you don't seem to be trolling, so I'm not sure why you're not seeing it.

While app coins can function as shares that pay dividends, that is not at all their most typical use case. Most of the examples you'll find in the article appendix use app coins in a similar way to funfair ride tokens in that they buy you use of the finished product instead of rewarding you with dividends. 
Say you want to build your dream funfair. You produce your little plastic tokens first and sell them for a dollar each to raise funds (the SWARM funding model). Or you can not sell them at all and instead use the tokens directly to pay the engineers and builders who are doing the work (the LTBCOIN model). 
In any case, the end result is that once your funfair is operational, those tokens will be worth much more than a dollar each and that is where your early investors or 'volunteers' get their return, which could very well be much more than the original BTC investment. Besides, you already have people with an incentive to use your funfair since they already have loads of tokens, also solving the problem of no one wanting to visit an empty funfair.
The funfair analogy is not perfect for two reasons:
1) because app coins can typically be subdivided into very small units just like Bitcoin, allowing them to appreciate as much as the market will allow
2) because typical app coin projects can also scale up to meet the market demand, unlike a funfair that has a limited capacity.

OP managed to trick the exchange's database into forgetting he withdrew 100 BTC by simultaneously selling off several 0.0001 BTC units and getting one of the small transactions to clash and overwrite the large withdrawal. 
So both operations read his balance of X BTC at the same time subtracted 100 BTC and 0.0001 BTC respectively. The first operation wrote back the balance of x - 100 into the database and the second operation then overwrote that balance with x - 0.0001, effectively giving OP back those 100 BTC.
One of the most basic things you need to take into account when implementing a database is record locking, to make sure only one operation can access a specific bit of data at one time and that any operation must relinquish control before another operation is allowed access, to make sure such clashes don't occur and corrupt the data.

The article is not even *arguing* for centralized banks, just stating that they are a great thing.

Forget SEC, investors, dividends and all that for one minute and consider that Bitcoin is the ultimate app coin. 
The Bitcoin app is a secure and distributed public ledger of cryptocurrency holdings and Bitcoin has very handsomely rewarded those who invested resources (ultimately a combination of time and money) early on in the project. The way it did that was by giving them digital tokens that were worthless or almost worthless at the time, but which have since appreciated greatly in value as the network that needed those tokens to power the app grew in size.
One day, maybe decades from now, Bitcoin will stop growing, but bitcoins won't suddenly become worthless. They will continue to retain value so long as the network that uses them continues to exist.
How are app coins any different, provided that the underlying app and its implementation are sound?

Many speculators have long considered Mt Gox as good as dead for a while now, and the price decline over the previous months reflected that assumption. 
Then there was another sharp dip as Gox was in its death throes this week, with some more uncertainty about how it would play out and people fearing the worst. 
Gox finally dies, there is no widespread panic and massive sell-off. People realize that a big storm has just passed over our heads and our boat is still floating and unharmed, so the mood is largely optimistic again.

I wouldn't say that's exactly how it happened. Before you could even buy things with Bitcoin, it already had value because of the way it works and the problems it was designed to solve. Not quite dollar value, which is what you're describing, but the value of a good idea that is being put into motion. That's what must have attracted the earliest of adopters, even before Bitcoin became worth any money at all. 
Now, most people may only be interested in the monetary value of Bitcoin, what you can buy with it, as you say. And that's why I found Johann Gevers' talk interesting: because he explains in simple terms the less obvious (though world-changing) benefits of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

Here's an addition to the Onarbor idea that will incentivize donations:
Onarbor issues its own crypto-asset called ONABORCOIN on a platform like Counterparty or Mastercoin. Each person who contributes to any project funding on Onarbor is rewarded with ONABORCOIN in proportion to their donation. They hold this asset in their digital wallet and can trade it on the exchanges.
Now some research will result in viable treatment and some will not, however, any company that buys research results from an Onarbor-funded project will be bound to perform the first certain number of procedures in exchange the ONABORCOIN asset, which is destroyed int he process. This rewards the initial investors who can sell their coins to patients who want to be among the first to receive the new treatment.

Yes,  the fact that some withdrawals were eventually going through is what kept people with money on Gox hopeful. What else could they do?

The main reason for XCP is that the Counterparty protocol cannot handle BTC directly, and so needs its own asset for making bets, paying betting fees and paying dividends on user-generated assets.
There are also other transactions (such as trading assets) that are possible directly for BTC without XCP. However, in the case of any exploit/bug, there would be no possibility of reversing fradulent transactions via a code update and recovering the BTC transferred because Counterparty cannot reverse BTC transactions. This means using XCP also makes trades more secure.

Launching a new cryptocurrency for an app is not trivial. Even if you generate enough interest to get people to mine your currency, you won't have the same security as if you build on top of Bitcoin and you risk losing it all if your miners ever desert you. The solution to this might be merged mining but it's not available yet and even the Bitcoin core devs are divided on this. The biggest issue I see with merged mining is that you are completely at the mercy of the big pools who may or may not want to go to the trouble of mining your app coin and continue to apply updates and patches as your coin requires and may ditch you at any time.
An entity does indeed typically have complete control if it issues an app coin, at least during the issuance period. But even if the coin were mined, you would still need to trust the entity to do its job well, give value to the coin, and above all continue to accept the coin within the app. 
The important thing here is that entities are transparent (which is easier on a public blockchain) and also that they have the confidence of the people. In this respect, it's no different from having to trust the directors of a regular company not to squander its assets. Again, trust is easier to achieve within a community.
As regards investing and profitability, you're quite right that it is probably not worth investing in most startups compared to BTC, but that doesn't deter serious investors. This article titled [Black Swan Farming]( was quite an eye-opener about how pro investors go about it. They don't even care about the startups that make a decent profit. What they are looking for is that special one that makes it big and goes to the moon, and you won't know which startup it will be until it happens.

Creating a paper wallet without printing means you  copy out the data needed to restore your wallet by hand onto a piece of paper, instead of printing it out.

Also remember that your paper wallet is not encrypted and anyone who finds that piece of paper can restore your wallet and take your BTC, so keep all backups safe.

What mean to say is that there are widely differing views about how much (if any) regulation Bitcoin should have, even at Bitcoin Fountation level, and we should bear in mind that Bitcoin could very well become another PayPal if we are not careful.
I'm less worried about regulators seizing control of Bitcoin than about Bitcoin playing into their hands. I think some regulation and recognition will boost the project, but also worry it might be a slippery slope.
EDIT: In any case, once a regulator with enough mining power can freeze accounts, they can force people to upgrade to a regulator-approved client to have their accounts unfrozen and there's a real danger that people will do just that to regain control over their money.

By that reasoning, investors would have no incentive to put money into Bitcoin startups companies instead of just buying Bitcoin. 
Your point about ASIC miner investments could very turn out to be true -- I actually think it will. However, the reality is that some businesses will appreciate faster than BTC and others will not in a given time frame, and some people will go all out BTC, others will go all out investing in companies, and still others will hedge their bets on both sides.
An app coin can indeed grow faster than BTC in a specific time period, and that is where the incentive comes for early adopters to participate. People who buy in later at a higher price will have progressively less risk (because the app is supposedly more proven) and less reward, until both risk and reward taper to zero. At every point along that curve, people buying the app coin just have to do their due diligence and determine how much they expect the app to continue growing. Based on that, they decide if they are speculating on the coin, or just buying it because they want to gain access to the system that uses it.
The thing is that thinking of app coins as just an investment is the wrong way to look at them. App coins are first and foremost a way to draw in early adopters to a community and keep a record of the value they bring to the community. Speculators can indeed come in and bet on the future value of those coins and sometimes you will have people speculating on the coins even before the surrounding community exists. Just because people might get carried away and create a bubble doesn't make the underlying business a scam.
See [my reply]( to another comment, where I explain how Bitcoin is the ultimate app coin. One day, BTC could very well stabilize against the USD, and it probably won't stabilize at the all-time high.
But does that mean that people who buy BTC then are getting cheated, or that Bitcoin is a scam? If you don't know that a growth curve will some day peak and invariably stabilize and probably even decline from the ATH, you shouldn't be investing in anything. Once there is stability, there will still be an incentive to buy BTC, not as an investment, but simply to be able to participate in the community and its network.

It's good you bring this up because there is a lot of confusion regarding appcoins. Most of the time, appcoins are not currencies as such and so cannot be compared to fiat currencies. Neither are they like stocks because they typically don't pay any dividends or have many of the other properties of stocks.
Appcoins are simply the tokens used within the ecosystem of a specific application. A better comparison would be airline miles, mobile credit, casino chips, loyalty points, funfair ride tokens, World of Warcraft gold and so on. 
This then makes it quite obvious that you have to trust the issuer, just like you have to trust the airline, mobile company, casino funfair and WoW or whever ecosystem you use, not just to administer the token supply responsibly but also ultimately to honor the coin itself.
Extreme caution, yes, but that's no different from investing in anything, even Bitcoin. If you don't do proper due diligence and spread risk across different investments, you're asking for trouble.

It's quite possible that these other uses for Bitcoin will also boost its use as a currency because people will need bitcoins for escrow and for payment on the contractual deals they make. If you are trading crypto-assets, it makes sense to use cryptocurrency so that you benefit from trustless atomic operations.
It would be crazy to accept payment for a digital asset you can't claim back in fiat that can be charged back.

These are all valid reasons for optimism, but most of them are so recent that they couldn't have influenced the rise we've been seeing.
No. 1 is definitely a huge factor. Same goes for the "Bitcoin is not dead yet" realization that someone else mentioned. VC capital too.
   
Overall it is that Bitcoin is slowly but surely coming of age and startling to gain wider acceptance. Some are even starting to see other exciting applications of the technology beyond money and payment networks. Investors, entrepreneurs and everyone else are shifting from "Bitcoin is nuts" to "Bitcoin, wow!"

Proof of burn does sound like quite a mysterious and drastic thing to do (that's part of the fun for some!), but here's a simple analogy that will show you it's really no different from how Bitcoins are created.
Bitcoin miners use up electricity (which is ultimately burning fuel if you discount the relatively low proportion of renewable energy used for mining) plus the resources used to create mining rigs and receive newly minted Bitcoins in return.
The those who burned BTC to get Counterparty XCP coins did the exact same thing, except the resource they destroyed was not more fossil fuels, but bitcoins. In a very real sense, they re-purposed the original energy spent to create those BTC and used it to create XCP.
The way BTC was burned is also quite simple to understand: it was sent to an address with no known private key, and so cannot ever be used again. The address is 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr.
The chance of anyone guessing the private key to respend those burned BTC is the same as the chance of guessing any private key for any other bitcoin address, meaning practically zero. This is because the first 28 characters of the burn address (1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) are so ordered as to be obviously specifically chosen, and not randomly generated as part of a public/private pair, as happens with normal bitcoin addresses. It is quite easy to create an address with a short chosen part (say 5 or 6 characters) but the difficulty in finding an address with a matching private key increases exponentially for every other character you chose.
Here is the [Proof of Burn article]( on the Bitcoin wiki, with much more detail, including (at the very end) how proof of burn could be used to transition from Bitcoin to a new cryptocurrency and distribute the new coins fairly to holders of BTC without having to mine new coins, should Bitcoin ever become obsolete. The proof of burn method described there is different from that used to create XCP, though.

When you trade for bitcoins, you have a time limit after your order is matched in which you must send the BTC manually to complete the transaction. This is because the Counterparty protocol cannot escrow bitcoin, but waits to detect the sent bitcoin before releasing the other side of the trade. Full automation of trades is another advantage of using XCP.

"A University of California, Davis study published in 2000 by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean titled “Trading Is Hazardous to Your Wealth,” showed a correlation between active trading and poor performance among individual investors. The study pointed to overconfidence as a cause of high-volume trading and the resulting poor performance. 
A 2004 academic study by Brad Barber, Yi-Tsung Lee, Yu-Jane Liu, and Terrance Odean examined the transaction history of the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1995 through 1999. Day trading among individual investors is common in Taiwan and accounted for over 20 percent of total trading volume during the period of the study. The research showed that while high-volume traders were sometimes able to earn gross profits, the profits were usually not enough to cover transaction costs. In a typical six-month period more than 80 percent of day traders lost money, and only 1 percent of them could be called predictably profitable." [Source](

Your comparisons don't hold water. Bitcoin is still an early prototype technology that needs more work before mainstream adoption can happen. 
Bitcoin today is like the Internet back in the late 80s/early 90s, when all you could do was send email and transfer files very slowly by typing complex commands. You had to jump through hoops just to get online, only to find there were relatively few people you could communicate with. It took a lot of imagination then to picture where it would all lead, so few people were interested in the Internet. But look at where we are now.
Bitcoin is a paradigm shift where the middlemen are sidelined. It's definitely not a mainstream gadget. Your grandma could probably figure out the first iPod. Not so with Bitcoin. Not yet.

At some point above the red line, of course. Exactly at what price point will depend on your particular circumstances, including the time frame you're trading on (day or long term) and how risk averse you are. You can jump on soon after it breaks through and risk it being a false breakout, or you can wait for more solid confirmation of an upswing but stand to make less money on the way up.

Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is like TCP/IP.
Do you know what is TCP/IP? Even if you don't, you use it all the time. Even now to have this conversation. Like TCP/IP, Bitcoin is a lower protocol layer. All the Internet is built on TCP/IP but nowadays most people never hear that term. They know what's the web, what's Netflix, what's Spotify and so on but they don't know these all run on TCP/IP. 
Bitcoin is a blockchain system that is forming the base layer for other systems to operate upon. As you have been told, the novelty here is the blockchain. But even more practical novelties (such as the Lightning Network, smart contracts and more) are being built on top of Bitcoin.

I might be missing more than that, actually. (no sarcasm) So help me out.

You're welcome. Like I said, whatever you consider.
However, as a professional copywriter, I would strongly recommend that you fix those things anyway. Some of the readability issues I pointed out are not trivial ones.
On a different note, I was just looking at Section 7 and have a remark to make about the graphs in Fig. 6.
In the caption for Fig. 6, you write:


However, it seems to me that a market depicted by graphs you use to illustrate unhealthy markets (b) would not incentivize a miner to produce an infinite block. 
The diminishing returns shown in the graph mean the miner will reach a point where the extra cost of waiting for a larger block to propagate so he can get paid outweigh the extra benefit he gets from the increased block size. If your reward increases at a diminishing rate towards an upper limit, there comes a time when you say, "I want my reward now." 
Also, I suppose the graph of miner surplus against propagation time would have a similar shape, since propagation time is roughly proportional to data size. This means that, with a graph like the one you used, miners would be better off mining smaller transactions, where profit over time (slope) is greater on average.
I think the graphs for an unhealthy market where miners would want to produce infinite blocks should diverge like the graphs for a non-existent market, but with an exponentially increasing surplus instead of deficit. 
Maybe the graph you used might be unhealthy because blocks are smaller than optimal.

How much Bitcoin do you think the community might burn for voting purposes each year? Even if the answer were in the millions of USD worth, you'd only need a fraction of that to swing the vote your way. And millions is chump change to a lot of interested parties out there anyway.
I also don't agree that we have little to lose from an attacker.
For a start, we probably wouldn't be able to realize right away that the vote is being manipulated, if we even realized at all. And besides, the damage would probably come in the form of a series of bad decisions over time that compound each other, rather than one single attack, because the devs are unlikely to be proposing any single change that would ruin Bitcoin on its own.
Then, by the time we figure something is wrong, it could be too late to fix things properly and get back on track.

Yes. But now we already have smartphones, so the next wave of adoption will be faster, just like smartphone adoption was much faster than landline adoption and even out-took landlines in some countries. Every wave tends to be faster when it has the luxury of building on existing technology that took time to get established. There will come a time when most people will get their first internet connection and bitcoin access at the same time through their first phone.

On the other hand, if bans on mining farms like this become widespread, it could be a decentralising force. We'd go back to being a bunch of people with GPUs and it would become profitable to mine again using GPUs. You can't ban people from running GPUs and there would be many more of us now, anyway. And best of all, the people in that town and in all towns will be able to get in on the action. I'm not arguing for bans on mining farms. I'm just saying what I think would happen.

Give it some time. Those of us who remember the early Internet have seen the transition from geek to mainstream explosion happen before. 
When I was in highschool, our Computer Studies teacher told us about this fancy new thing called electronic mail and so-called play by mail games, where you would send in your turn-based actions via email and wait for the games master to evaluate everyone's responses and describe how the game scenario has changed. Super geeky stuff, but look at online gaming now.
A couple of years later, at uni, I got an email address but had no one to email really, outside of my classmates, people at other unis and a couple of friends I could call anyway. This was pre-Netscape when internet browsers were black and white text based things and you controlled them by typing in commands. 
When Netscape came along, exploring the web was hit and miss (Yahoo was barely getting started) until someone walked into the computer lab with [a book like this one]( an actual big fat 'phonebook' of interesting websites. And then Google came along and the rest is history.

The point of the talk is not that technology doesn't help the poor, or that it is inherently bad for them, or that it won't reach them eventually, which is what you seem to be arguing against. 
What he said is that while adoption is happening there will be an increase in inequality, which, even if temporary for most, has significant consequences that we should be aware of. I think it is easy to forget this in our enthusiasm for what Bitcoin can do for these people. My takeaway was that it is important that adoption happens as fast and as widely as possible in order to minimize this effect. Services like SMS to Bitcoin gateways (which  already exist or are being developed) will go a long way in this regard, but we still need to keep an eye out as much as we can for those who will inevitably be left behind.

I served as core team member both before and after the launch of LTBCoin and was also managing editor for a time.
My personal view is that the LTBCoin crash was a direct result of the decision to work too hard and too soon on Tokenly and other side projects at the expense of building up the main LTB content network. Don't get me wrong, Tokenly is an awesome project, but unfortunately it took the wind out of the sails of the core LTB operation, ruining the LTBCoin experiment.
A little over a year ago (early summer 2014), you had an enthusiastic team of writers and editors at LTB working hard to publish lots of great content. I'm talking of several articles a day, with a publishing backlog slowly building up as the prospect of earning LTBCoin drew in new writing talent. 
LTBCoin drew in a good deal of mediocre writers too, and what was missing and necessary was a well-designed underlying software system to decentralize the writing and editing and make the process scale smoothly as demand grew. This was supposed to happen by building an LTB talent market and reputation system where people could offer their services and be rated based on their work.
Another crucial thing that got put on the back burner for Tokenly's sake was a drive to get more advertising on the site, including building a planned system where people could easily buy ads with their LTBC or BTC, vending machine style.
When those things didn't happen, editors (who were already under-compensated compared to writers) started to get fed up and leave, which increased backlog issues and frustrated the writers. This put an end to any chances of getting enough advertising paid in LTBC to give value to the coin, which was the original intention and the whole point at the end of the day.
That's my 2c.

A dip of $10/BTC is nothing in the current volatile market. A price drop to $20 or a bit above that is totally possible because markets tend to oscillate in a range even when the bigger picture is a trend, and the current range seems to have the psychological $30 as an upper limit (resistance) and $20 as a lower limit (support). Look up [support and resistance](
Edit: Another psychological support is $25, and we have already seen a test of that level 2 days ago, which failed to penetrate below. Looking at the [chart]( right now, it seems there might be another test coming soon. Then again, the market might decide to go up and test the $30 resistance. If predicting this stuff were an exact science, there wouldn't be any market, haha!

Agreed. Mining is the equivalent to buying BTC at much less than market value. Otherwise if you're buying bitcoins to speculate, you need to be ready to ride a crash and watch your investment's value drop before a possible recovery. 
Personally, my heart skips a beat both ways when I see the price of BTC jump, because it just fuels speculation which makes a crash much more likely. Thankfully price seems to have stabilized at around $28 over the last few days, indicating that the $30 psychological resistance barrier is not yet overcome. If it stays that way at least until the next mining difficulty increase, the stability would encourage more traders to adopt bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-12 09:10:59

With 1400 ~~G~~M-Hash (4x stock Radeon 5870s) you would find one block every 20 days on average *at the current difficulty*. The key word is *average*. You could find a block after a couple of days (or not) and then spend 2 months of continuous mining without earning one measly BTC, which makes it into a kind of lottery that can work for you or against you in a big way. The more G-Hash, you have, the less variance you get in the discovery times, which is why people pool resources - to minimize the risk and get steady rewards, at the expense of the pool fee and also possible (probable) server downtime.

The killer app for this is spam prevention by means of a standard minimum payment fee that everyone demands. Most people send out more or less as many emails as they receive, and a 0.5 cent fee per email won't be a problem if they go over. However, it's enough to make it uneconomical for spammers to send out thousands of emails per day, which would reduce the amount everyone else gets in their inboxes.
In this case, the fee is automatically paid if it is below a certain threshold, which makes it transparent to the user.

You need to make the paradigm shift if you are going to really understand smart contracts. Smart contracts are about decentralisation which means removing or reducing to a minimum the need for any kind of central authority. One aspect of this, will possibly also include the ability for the convening parties in the contract to determine their own laws that apply to the contract and which are also embedded as part of the contract. 
The word 'smart' refers to the idea that these contracts can execute themselves and determine the agreed-upon outcome automatically once they have been set up.  In the digital world, this enforcement is easy to implement because you don't have to interface with real-world security devices. Digital talks to digital just fine. But this is just like how we used to have to scan our photos before digital cameras came along. The early adopters will manage the best they can until the technology is available for the rest of the world. 
Again, the thing to understand is that the philosophy behind smart contracts is eliminating the need for a central authority. If you don't pay the rent on your apartment, you are locked out just like that as stipulated in the contract without the need for any expensive and lengthy court battles. You may agree with that philosophy or not, but that is what smart contracts are about. 
**EDIT:** Of course, the courts can always decide that the other party is right and send men with guns to enforce that against the blockchain's outcome . But this method will start to seem increasingly medieval and barbaric once a computer has peacefully decided and assigned property rights based on what was originally agreed and encoded in the contract. 
Calling the cops and going to the courts in such a scenario will become the new 'taking the law into your own hands' because the real law is laid down by the computer code. This is the paradigm shift from a different perspective.

In a free society, people have a right to call for the regulation of HFT and bots, the shutting down trading when there's a run, and all that, so I'm not going to judge them. At the same time, those who disagree are free to set up their own exchange where there's none of that. Ultimately, a crash at a free-for-all exchange will probably take down the other exchanges with it anyway, so those rules and safeguards serve little purpose.
Basically, I'm saying that it goes against the spirit of freedom and is just as hypocritical to force people into one way of doing things or another. I'm bracing myself for the downvotes, but if Bitcoin is a free currency, anyone should be able to use it as they like and within the constraints they like.
We can discuss our different ideals and express a critical opinion however, if we truly believe in freedom, we cannot get annoyed at people for exercising it.

Speculators don't care about value at all. They care about the *difference* in value between now and some future time. They do try to manipulate the value, but only because it suits their goal of having predictable changes in value.
On the other hand, if you're selling something and I have dollars, I am the one to determine how many of my dollars I am willing to give up for your something and it is I, together with other people who want to buy that thing, who decide the price with you and all the other sellers.

I'm not suggesting that Bitcoin is tied, inversely as you say, to any specific country's banks, but rather to the trust people place in the European (and global) banking system as a whole. 
This trust has been shaken by the way the Cyprus bailout was handled and how even insured savings (below 100K EUR) were going to be confiscated, and that caused a jump in the price of BTC. 
Wouldn't such a shock and possibly BTC price jump be much larger so in the case of a bigger country getting similar treatment?

Bitcoin is not about being pro or anti government. It's about being against the government having complete and arbitrary power over personal assets, bank accounts in particular. The question to ask people when introducing Bitcoin is, "do you want to have full control over your money?"
I am sure that if 9/10 people are strongly turned off by anti-government beliefs, they are also strongly turned off by governments who devalue money by printing more to pay for their incompetence. I bet they are also against governments raising taxes or cutting on social spending to pay for the mistakes of bankers and oligarchs, as is happening all over Europe and also in the US. And I bet these people are even more strongly opposed to governments confiscating money from their personal accounts for that purpose, as happened in Cyprus.
With Bitcoin, those kind of things can't happen. That is what we need to get across.

Right now there is no way to short BTC, which is what was needed to keep the soaring price in check, so we mostly got speculators betting that the price would go up - bad idea.

What you say is true of Bitcoin TODAY, just like it was true of email when I got my first ever account. Now, I'm not saying Bitcoin will be the cryptocurrency that makes it (that's like betting on Skype and then Whatsapp comes along), but it's a safe bet to say that some form of crypto will be the money of the future. If you can't see that, I won't be the one to try and convince you. Just read up and open your eyes.
Think about PayPal, if you need a similar example. Why did people go to the trouble of using it when they already had credit cards? PayPal is mostly disadvantageous for merchants, and yet many now use it begrudgingly because customers saw its advantages from their point of view and started using it enough.
Anyway, back then, the biggest cost to using email was to actually get an Internet subscription that wasn't even commercially available yet in most places around the world, and then you had to figure out some clunky email program, just to have nobody to email really. 
Someone else just posted a 1995 article that laughed at the Internet in the early days and said why it would fail. I remember that time when Windows 95 was so hot and when just about the only people I could email were my university profs and mates and a handful of companies. I remember one day when a classmate came a long with a physical BOOK they bought of websites to type out and discover. Fancy that! There were books you had to buy to try and figure out how to use the Internet. Search was terribly primitive. Yahoo! was barely a thing.
Even then, the sentiment of that 1995 article sounded ludicrous. We were terribly excited about the Internet, even if we had no idea of many of the things you can do online today. 
I'd advise some caution before you try and give any history lessons on BTC.

There are speculators. And there are "speculators" who jump blindly on the bandwagon and panic and run when they see their shadow. Bitcoin has sucked mostly for the second kind, and that's a good thing.

Interesting comment, especially about the price of gold dropping. 
I have no idea if the Cyprus bailout directly or indirectly caused the extra media exposure for Bitcoin, though, or if that's just coincidence. I'd guess a bit of both. However, gold is already widely known, while BTC is new, so the potential effect on Bitcoin from any extra media exposure is much greater.
I just couldn't help thinking about the fact that Cypriots would have needed only a modest proportion of their savings in BTC to not be so worried about 10% of their bank accounts being skimmed off. Thinking about this some more, I agree with you that the jumps we've seen are not necessarily directly attributable to Cyprus or even guaranteed in similar scenarios, so I'd say holding BTC is diversifying risk, as opposed to being an actual hedge.

Yes. I mean that it could stay at around $150, trading sideways somewhere between $100 and $200 and testing both limits to see which one will give.

I lost like 30 or 40% in my brief experiment with Forex a few years back, (total investment $70 lol - I spent much more on books!). Still, the things I learned are priceless - not least how to keep emotions in check whether you're currently winning or losing.

What I'm thinking is not simply going against the flow. It's taking advantage of novice trading actions that would lose you money by placing the exact opposite trade without the novice knowing.

If you haven't seen this video, it will give you an idea of what an open-minded and progressive guy Neil is: 
I think he'll love the idea of Bitcoin. As he says in the vid, he once convinced his publisher to offer one of his books for free as an experiment. If you got him to put a title or two up for sale for BTC, that would be massive PR!
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:52:47
Yes. I think the main problem stems from the unfortunate misnaming of wallet.dat, which is actually a bank account, not a wallet. The result is that there will be people who might think it safe to store huge amounts of BTC in their paper wallet, just like they do in their digital wallet.
With this in mind, I'd prefer to call what OP has made a 'prepaid card' to avoid any confusion.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:29:34
I don't get paper wallets that look like paper wallets in the sense that they're no safer than cash. If you're going to print out your private key, you'd be better off disguising it as a few passwords or a puzzle solution or whatever.

Simple: because there are still many Bitcoin sellers with a low p who are happy to trade their coins for ~$150. It could be because they want to cash out. Or because they believe there will be a dip and they want to sell high and buy low. Or they just have loads of coins and want to take partial profit to hedge their bet against a dip. The thing is there is a good supply at current prices.

Three important questions we need answered if we are to continue to trust MtGox:
1) How did you not foresee the "overwhelming amount of new accounts" and the need for new servers if demand for Bitcoin had been steadily rising since January?
2) Considering the relatively low cost of hardware compared to the extra revenue you have been earning from the Bitcoin's growing popularity, why didn't you keep some extra hardware (servers) on hand, so you could upgrade as necessary?
3) What are you going to do to make sure this won't happen again?

I was referring to the system where different segments of society separate into their own forks and nobody imposes their will on others. I thought that was what you were advocating.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:34:36
I always wondered: if people who don't know what they're doing inevitably lose money trading, couldn't you have a system that (without them knowing) places the exact opposite orders of what they ask for.  So, they just sit down and play the trading game, except that what they see as wins are really losses and their losses are wins. 
Sounds like an interesting experiment.

Psychology 101: people always act out of self interest. Even in an apparently altruistic act, you will always find an element of self interest if you dig deeply enough. It could be the good feeling you get from doing something good for others. It could be that you avoid feeling guilty. 
A solder dies for *his* country.
A mother makes sacrifices for *her* child.
There's a strong element of self in everything we do.
So, when people have a chance to make money and benefit themselves it shouldn't come as a surprise that most will snap it up. The rest of us who held on to our BTC did so either because we think BTC will be worth more in the long run or because Bitcoin's success is more important to *us* than earning fiat dollars. Either way, there's still an element of self interest involved. Let us not delude ourselves.

Keep in mind this is not about sounding like a 'True Believer' in Bitcoin, as you put it, or even explaining complex philosophical arguments. It's about stating what your underlying beliefs about cryptocurrencies in a way that establishes common ground with the people you're talking to.


How do you think they will react to something like that? They'll probably tell you they think so too but they have no other option. And bingo! You now have their attention.

I didn't mean to imply that chaos = violence. But if you consider that there will always be a violent fork within society, the other forks are forced to resort to violence as well if for no other reason than to try and keep the violent fork in check. Wouldn't this drag everyone down to the level of the lowest common denominator and end in voting by means of war?

Do you have to be insulting? I let it slide the first time, but I hope this is not the way you propose to negotiate in a free society.
The thing is I agree with much of what you've been saying, just that I also think humanity is in a Prisoners' Dilemma situation where unfortunately violence trumps cooperation as the best strategy. If everyone is cooperating and someone is violent, he gets the upper-hand unless he is stopped by more violence or the threat of violence. Now insofar as violence by voting or the threat of violence can replace actual physical violence, then I'd say there are the lesser of necessary evils.
I'm not saying there couldn't be a better system out there where everyone is free and the violent are kept in check without violence, but we still have to come up with it.

It may well be, but you need some more explanation on the site to get that across. 
1) You need to stop saying 'get free bitcoins'. If people have to do work work to get those BTC, then they're not free. In the copywriting and marketing business, we call that a 'bait and switch' -- promise something to get attention, and then change the offer once they're listening. I know you may not have done that on purpose, but that sort of thing undermines people's trust in you and makes them feel cheated before they even start working with you.
2) I don't know if you deliberately made the 'complete free offers' part so dark so it is not very apparent, but my first impression of the site was: 1) Reveal personal info (bitcoin address) 2) ??? 3) PROFIT!. That's makes it look like some kind of phishing attempt. I know you can't take my BTC just because I give you my address, but many people might not know that and it still looks suspicious anyway.
3) Even if I were looking to fill out some surveys or whatever for BTC, it's not really clear at first glance that I can do that on the site. I would be more up-front about how your site works and show potential offers and rewards straight up. Sure, fewer people might enter their Bitcoin address in the box, but hopefully more of them will complete offers and make you money.
4) An FAQ and some more info would be a good idea.
EDIT: fixed some typos.
