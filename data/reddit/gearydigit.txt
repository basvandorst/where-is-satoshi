Stability in value.

And doing so is extremely risky because if the value goes up after you buy something with it then you just wasted money.
Nobody without some weird ideological bent or a financial stake wants to touch Bitcoin, so you can't simply say that the problem will be solved when your solution is impossible as long as the problem exists.

If you have to treat literally every purchase like a major business decision then you don't have a viable currency.
In the same way that the number of non-Mormons is shrinking every day.

'Improving' here is subjective. None of the fundimental problems have been addressed, and it doesn't appear that anybody cares to or is able to address them.
Once you start introducing third parties to manage your money to make your money usable, then you've sort of defeated the entire ideological purpose of bitcoin.

Buying things with cash/credit/debit doesn't take forty-five minutes to process.
I don't buy Bitcoin for the same reason why I don't play slots or invest in volatile stocks.

Can't you just get it exchanged at the airport or embassy or something?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:24:22
Fair enough!

How do expect people to adopt it as a currency when it's not stable enough to be used as a currency?

And they're still impossible to use without an instruction manual.

First, I'm Amercian. I live in America. I was born in America. My family have lived in America for as long as records exist. Stop with the conspiracy theories.
 [Second, anybody can see your comment history, dude.](
1. I'm an American and I wouldnt go to Europe if you paid me to, and not because it's unsafe, but because Europe sucks quite a bit. In fact, if they were to fall under a nuclear strike from N. Korea, I would not even feel compassion for them. In fact, I was actually googling this possibilty and fingers crossed, France issued a warning. Dare I hope? Dare I dream that these bastards should get nuked? 
2. The worst part is I wasnt trolling, I actually do sometimes hope that especially northern europe is hit by a nuclear strike. Somehow I feel like the world would be a more relaxed place without Europe. 
3. Europeans are cowards who hide behind their older eurotrash culture, because as individuals they are not very interesting and they take the cowards way out of dreaming about how great their history is rather than being themselves.
4. I would only ever use a gun to shoot a European. The more of them that are dead the better.
5. Serbia needs more guns because European nations support the fascist Ustashi in Croatia and the magical muslim Bosniaks. The Ustashi that Germany helped arm during the Bosnian war were the same ones that literally took eyeballs as trophies from Serbs and Jews during WW2.

You know what the word 'like' means, right?

Yes, the great totalitarian state practicing genocide known as... Canada.
More relevantly, countries that elected reactionary fascists went on to murder 100 million of their own civilians. You know, like the one you voted for in 2016.

Canada introduced gun control, and went on to kill nobody.
UK introduced gun control, and went on to kill nobody.
Australia introduced gun control, and went on to kill nobody.
The US has never introduced gun control and kills people constantly.
Correlation != Causation
Further, they were *pretty obviously* talking about the modern day.
