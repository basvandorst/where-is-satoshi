We already offer some of our songs free for download. Then for the other songs on the album they could go to itunes and pay 99cents per song (we only get around 60 cents of that) OR they can give Apple the middle finger and get it from our website for just 25 cents worth of Bitcoin. After all most money is made at shows by selling merch and obtaining new fans.

How would one accept a payment through changetip and then once payment received automatically send the user to our download? I like changetip but I don't think it can be used this way. 
We're not totally against a centralized services but most of them don't appeal to us. Sending someone to another site seems tacky, we want seamless. gave a great suggestion (satoshibox.com) I actually really like this one so far, no sign up (main reason I don't like coinbase and bitpay) and they offer a code snippet that we can place right in our existing code. User clicks on it, a tiny js window pops up and asks for payment then sends them the file.

Appreciate the link, but i'm lost at the install, where do I type these commands? Is this linux only, I'm on windows.  I'm really surprised there isn't an easier way, like downloading a min.js or a php library with a list of commands, dropping it on our server and then start coding away.  I coded my first game when I was 13 in visual basic, I made a mortal kombat clone, friends come to me when they need a website built but I'm lost when it comes to all this Bitcoin website implementation stuff. How is a 'normal' person supposed to implement bitcoin if even I with coding experience can't figure this stuff out?

Thanks for the info. What about difficulty? How does the difficulty make it so that it takes these huge pools longer to find a block yet at the same time allow smaller miners still have a chance to find a block?
Sorry for all the questions, I just don't understand the technicalities of how mining actually works.

What would you do luffin?  3rd party or Bitcoind?
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:34:06
What's the bitcoin solution? I'm not throwing anything away, we're just trying to figure out how to do this the best way. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:48:54
This is great! Super easy to use, no sign up, and you can choose the option for a little snippet of javascript so it will fit in seamlessly with our website. This has been the quickest and easiest solution so far. Thanks!!

Very good points...  Well in the days before bitcoin it was selling an album for $10 on your website with a paypal pay now button. I love the idea of micro payments with bitcoin, being able to sell a song for just 25 cents would be awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:29:45
Thanks, PM sent!
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:33:45
I think this might be what we are looking for...  Is this a javascript library?
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:49:07
Yea I understand the gist of it, there's a new block generated every ~10 minutes or so, each block contains the transactions, transactions are confirmed by nodes or miners.  I have a cold paper wallet from watching James DAngelo on youtube. I wish there were some development videos on youtube. Bitcoin is used for online payments so I figured the  video on BTC should be how to set up your site to accept Bitcoins.

Nobody pays or any music anymore ;)  But what if one of your favorite bands releases a brand new track and tells you that you can have it for just 300 bits, wouldn't you be inclined to just pay the small fee instead of having to wait for the torrent?
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:16:25
The blockchain is huge and takes several days to download. If Bitcoin wants mass adoption these things need to become easier and more resources need to be available to new comers. If someone wants to start accepting bitcoin they should be able to in a day or two, instead of having to spend weeks in development. The learning curve for bitcoin is steep. I want to use it as a payment method and I am determined to learn how and it's still very difficult. Merchants that are not as enthusiastic as myself would have given up by now.  
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:00:22
Ahh this looks cool and in a language we already understand!  I understand most of the code you have.  I see how it works, large # of pregenerated address, user added to mysql DB, user is prompted a random address using mt_rand, they send the coins, hit submit. BTC function runs an inquiry on the address output in JSON using blockchain API to check the balance, output at result page.  Let me know when this is done, it's pretty much exactly what we were looking for!
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:17:18
Yes this is what we want. An open source version similar to coinbase but without having to use coinbase or register with some 3rd party. Like I mentioned we've been trying with the blockchain API and we know some basics of coding and using PHP and storing sessions and mySQL databases... we're not complete morons, but we do need help on how to get this working so it can all be customized and ran locally on our website server. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:50:26
Thanks for the info! This is going to take some time. In order to run Bitcoind we have to be running a full node on our server or get a VPS at like digitalocean, correct?
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:23:16
From all these response so far I like SatoshiBox.com anyone can use it, no sign up and just copy and paste the code in your website or blog or paste the link on facebook.   I still think we're going to go with something like the above php btcbox and try to do it ourselves. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:38:41
So it's like a lotto, the more hash rate the more tickets you have? So technically, someone can turn on their bitcoin-qt and do setgenerate to start CPU mining and actually find a block if they're lucky?
Why do some people say it would take BLANK number of years to find a block at a certain hash rate?

So I looked into bitcoinj and I got as far as running JDK 8 and trying to launch the bitcoin bundled javascript in this DOS looking window... and I couldn't get it to run... this stuff is insanely complicated and for advanced users only it seems. 
I requested an invite with Yumcoin
Maybe we'll just deal with it and use coinbase :/
I was really hoping there was a way that we could assign each user a cookie in PHP, log them to a database, prompt them with a BTC address and if they pay it we could update a column in the database from not paid to paid and allow them to download the mp3. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:08:01
Yes, but we were hoping there was a way to set up without having to provide our personal tax info and IDs. 
There isn't any existing code out there for this without using some 3rd party? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:38:54
Appreciate the input, perhaps we just need to take a leap of faith and try the bitoind route with JSON RPC commands.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:09:11
Thanks for the info. We were hoping of a way to use paper wallets so the coins aren't stored on the server. We were thinking of somehow monitoring for the addresses for incoming payments. Perhaps one way of identifying one user from another would be by asking each user to send a different amount (0.00016559 vs 0.00016451)? It would practically be the same amount worth of USD so the consumer probably wouldn't care.  Charge everyone 0.00016xxx and the xxx could be a random # that is added to the databse so when the payment comes in the server will know which user paid. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:22:35
All we should need is our bitcoin addresses and then code for monitoring the blockchain for incoming for payments.  I want code and/or tutorials not a 3rd party to register with and rely on. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:56:40
Yea I know I said no 3rd party, mainly I wanted to avoid responses like "just sign up at bitpay and coinbase". There have been a few 3rd party suggestions that I've liked so far and might end up using.
