Because some of us in Europe trading in euro cannot link a bank account to Gdax, only to Coinbase so have to transfer back and forth
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:45:37
I'm not sure if you can transfer from revolut to pro in sterling, I do euro transfers which only take a couple of hours if transfer is before noon.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:46:35
Exactly, change pounds to euro and transfer,
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:19:25
I don't know as I am holding at present but I haven't had an issue moving any coins I've purchased, I'm on level 2 I think and am with them a couple of years now.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:25:44
Yes, euro transfer by eft iban, I presume that's sepa, it's not instant but only a few hours if done before noon,
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:59:14
Yes, but it is still not a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:50:27
Can you do sepa sterling to coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:26:21
By the way, I'm not in the UK but I presume this option is available to you.
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:47:49
Yes, it's instant
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:07:23
Maybe because you are a new user, I think it took about 5 days for money to clear when I did bank transfers in the early days, then changed to revolut transfers to coinbase pro which were there and cleared within hours if transfer done before noon.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:23:02
There is only one way to find out, purchase a small amount and try moving it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:12:06
The quickest method of depositing money to purchase is the following, get a revolut account, add money from your debit/credit card which is instant, convert sterling to euro as you can't lodge sterling in coinbase pro, do a sepa transfer to pro, if you transfer before noon, then money will be available within 2 or 3 hours to trade.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:33:47
It's not a scam but an easy option for some to buy and sell using the App,
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:16:31
Get a revolut card, top up with your debit card, instant top up, set up account on coinbase/coinbase pro, same company, transfer money from revolut to coinbase, takes at most one working day, sometimes only a few hours, purchase using the 'limit buy' on coinbase pro, all the above are fee free methods, this is the system I use.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:04:11
Where did you purchase these?
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:02:14
No fees if you buy and sell using limit orders.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:08:29
Could someone explain halving to me please, I don't have bitcoin in my portfolio, am waiting for an entry point, which hopefully isn't too far away. Would like a whole bitcoin to add and hold for a few years,

Some of us are just not meant to be rich. I'm getting poorer by the day, invested as a first time trader at the height of the 2017 boom and still haven't recovered my losses, but I'm still hodling on for dear life. And I'm not getting any younger.

Have you got an App Lock in settings? I have on my mobile, can set lock on individual apps.
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:20:17
This is my method of buying and selling using limit orders, no fees.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:45:50
Why are you not using coinbase pro and limit orders, no fee here.
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:16:42
Open Gdax which has same login details as coinbase, click the trade tab and the deposit button, this will open another screen with sepa, coinbase and either ltc, eth or btc address, select coinbase and euro wallet and transfer across whatever amount you wish, then in Gdax at top left of screen, you will have to select whatever you intend to purchase with your Fiat i.e. ltc/Fiat, eth/Fiat etc, then do a limit buy for no fee.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:39:56
Can someone explain karma to me, my posts have all disappeared.
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:18:25
Agree with this and is exactly what I do, transfer Fiat to Coinbase, withdraw from coinbase and deposit to Gdax and trade from here. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:44:33
Don't trade on coinbase, move your Fiat or crypto over to Gdax, sister company of coinbase with same login, do limit buy and sell orders, no fees.

Join Revolut if available in your country and set up sepa transfer, 
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:32:43
So would you mind up voting me please?

If it's any consolation to you, I have some coins on coinbase and quite a few on Binance, i maybe taking a gamble leaving them on Binance exchange but as I am trading a bit, it would be costly taking them off and on to the exchange, coinbase has its own wallet for each coin and is supposed to be secure.
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:57:28
I am poorer
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:40:57
That's so funny, 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:33:16
If it makes you feel any better, I had to produce photo evidence to my bank to transfer money from my account to an external account. My bank card did not suffice, no way would they do the transfer for me without proof of identity. Normally, I do all my transactions online but this transfer exceeded the daily online limit, hence the reason I had to visit a physical bank to move my own money.
@_date: 2018-12-22 19:49:23
If you are in the UK, best to join Revolut , do a top-up from your bank card to Revolut, log into coinbase pro and select deposit and note the bank EFT details, set these up on the Revolut app and transfer money across to coinbase pro. All done and dusted within a day. And then use limit buy orders to purchase, no fees. Happy days.
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:24:01
Have you Revolut, there is a virtual card option if you don't  have a physical card, instant transfer from your credit/debit card to Revolut which is free, then check coinbase pro, under the deposit tab, there are EFt details, set this up on the Revolut app, transfer from Revolut to coinbase pro, free again to do this and takes just a number of hours, this transfers your money to coinbase, log into coinbase pro and deposit money from the coinbase app, then use the limit buy option on coinbase pro which is free and you can transfer out for free as well, this is how I do my trades. As it is the weekend it will take longer. Or you can buy the coins directly on Revolut but I have never bought from here.

I have some LTC, is it better to convert to bitcoin or hold the LTC, I bought some at peak but have been DCA down to present value, I see quite a lot of advice, only spend what you are willing to lose, but truthfully, I don't want to lose anything, but in saying that, have lost about 90% of my investment, I am still holding in the hope it will come right, eventually. Have some neo, gvt, waves and Eth, as well. Surely, something here is the pot of gold I hope to find.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:02:22
Does anyone really know what is going happen, I think not, I am not in a position to buy anymore, the more I buy, the more I am down, I must be 90% down on my initial investment, I am pathetic at this buying the dip, the dip keeps dipping, from the high of December '17. Where it stops, nobody knows, now let's be honest here. The only thing we can honestly say is, it will stop dipping at some point.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:29:25
If you trade on coinbase pro using limit orders, then you will not incur any fees.
