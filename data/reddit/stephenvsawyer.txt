I switched from the Eclair wallet to the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet and am just waiting for my Bitcoin transfer into it to confirm to pick a well connected node and start using Lightning. Can't wait! Going to use the most well connected node there is according to 1ML.com which is powernode.io... With such a connected node I should hopefully never have any issues sending and receiving
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:26:26
Oh right I'm bad at math. Wonder why the fee is so "high". Must be the node I'm using?
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:54:31
I feel like this entire line of thought sprang up out of the super high transaction fees and long confirmation times that came with Bitcoin gaining popularity which is insane. Just because L1 Bitcoin in it's current state can't fulfil it's INTENDED purpose of being a pier to pier electronic CASH system. Lightning solves this problem entirely. Just needs further development and improvement.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:28:48
Ah ok. 0.001 USD would be 1/10th not 1/100th? For some reason it looks like 1/100th to me I can't wrap my head around it lmao

Not remotely polished or working enough for that...
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:42:59
Then I have to pay mining fees when transferring from that legacy wallet I controll to my actual Bitcoin Wallet... The goal here is to completely avoid all fees.
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:58:00
Well for one thing, transaction fees would be in the thousands of dollars and it would take days to be confirmed into a block
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:53:13

Woah. You just blew my mind.

I've played around with Nano already �� just way too difficult to buy and sell. Once there are fast and easy Fiat on off ramps I might jump in.
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:35:54
I'm not using Nano at all. Using Bitcoin for fun really.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:52:01
Yes it is and yes it does
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:52:05
And pay fees to do so...
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:25:39
Because no one uses Nano and it's not on any exchanges. if Nano ever replaces Bitcoin or sees adoption I'll switch
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:41:51
That really depends... Most traders end up just losing all or their money. Good traders are most profitable. Investors always make money but they split the difference between losing everything and making max profits. Safer and smarter to be an investor.

Think I finally get it lol
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:40:12
No... Lightning is not free. You pay on chain fees to open the channel and close the channel. That's two fees right there. Also, when you first open a channel, you cannot receive payments. Let's say you open a channel with $20. You can't have someone send you a lightning payment, as your channel has a capacity of $20. So you would either have to send your whole $20 somewhere first to free up capacity OR you have to PAY A FEE to a service to give you inbound capacity. Do you even know how LN works?
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:21:40
I have no way of changing the route. I opened this channel using the official Eclair Node.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:27:50
That doesn't work as I opened a channel with 200,000 sats and spent 2000 but cannot receive 2000 back... No inbound capacity.
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:01:57
No, I'm not... I'm using the Eclair Mobile wallet and I opened this channel with 200k Sats on the official Eclair Node...
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:19:28
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:14:04
Unfortunately it failed to send to two different exchanges so I'm switching to another wallet and will open a channel to a more well connected node. Will try again then
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:25:10
That's 1 / 100th of a penny fee! Haha

Mine went through can you try resending yours to my request ?
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:34:35
Lightning is supposed to be free, so far in my experience to use it as it should be used it literally costs more than the standard blockchain with it's current 1sat/byte fees... Truly do not understand how Lightning is still this god aweful after being in developement for 4 years
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:00:20
To send Bitcoin to CoinBase Pro? That's definitely possible. It's also possible to withdraw Bitcoin from Coinbase... I just don't know if I can deposit then immediately withdraw that same Bitcoin...

Idk... I just started using the Lightning Network yesterday and so far it's been amazing. Definitely many ways it can be improved but even in it's current state it's 100% usable and costs at most 1/10th of a penny to send transactions instantly to anyone.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:25:04
It wasn't 20k 2 months ago ...
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:05:27

Gold has never been volatile in the sense that Bitcoin is. It’s never lost %90 like Bitcoin has. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:37:13
I disagree, it’s a peer to peer digital cash, that can also be used as a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:40:19
Gold is literally the least volatile commodity, you make no sense... 
Edit: A “store of value” is something you store value in, meaning you don’t want the value of it to change, which is why gold is such a good store of value. Bitcoin is literally the worst possible store of value because of how volatile it is.

@_date: 2019-11-22 21:56:59
Yikes... Just read this from their website. So if Greens servers go down, you cannot access any of your Bitcoin for 90 days. This is obviously a HUGE issue and should disuad anyone from using this wallet. Any chance of losing access to your funds for a day let alone 90 is unacceptable in a wallet. 
"Funds in your main Green account (or a multisignature 2of2 subaccount) require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Green. In order to protect you from loss of access to your funds should Green become unavailable, Green automatically creates pre-signed transactions which you can subsequently countersign to recover the funds to an address controlled solely by you. These transactions are called nLockTime transactions because they can only be spent and confirmed by the network after a specific period of time.
If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait until the specified expiry period (90 days by default), then sign and send the transaction using our open source recovery tool garecovery."

@_date: 2019-10-08 18:11:06
It’s cash, except it’s even more difficult to lose than cash or gold because cash can slip right out of your wallet or be stolen, Bitcoin can’t be unless you’re retarded. 
Also, storing Bitcoin on an exchange is the equivalent of handing a ton of cash to a random company you’ve never heard of and asking them to promise to keep it safe for you. It’s idiotic. 
Suffice it to say, if you lose Bitcoin you’re retarded, and it’s way easier and safer to secure and keep safe than both cash and gold.
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:26:34

Monero does have pruning as of [February ]( and the new RandomX PoW coming in a month actually makes mining with consumer CPUs WAY better and far better than mining with a GPU which will make almost everyone with a PC a miner (if they want).
Other than those two points is there any other reason (other than Bitcoins network effect) to choose Bitcoin over Monero?

I don’t know about you and the other people in this sub, but I keep my “fiat” in a US Credit Union which has a 1.6% interest rate and completely zero fees. No one is robbing me. I keep my retirement investments/savings in a Vanguard Roth IRA which holds Vanguard ETFs that have a 0.04% annual maintenance fee but other than that absolutely no fees or taxes etc. 
This whole idea of “fiat is evil you’re being robbed” is utter bull shit unless you’re simply not smart with your money or don’t know how to properly manage it.

RVC: I've read that mobile wallets should only be used for pocket change. How much money can I safely keep on my phone at one time?
It's ironic, because many people don't realize that their smartphones are actually the most secure computing device they own, far more secure than desktop or laptop systems. It's wallets that can be accessed from the web or desktop that should really only be used for pocket change.
An iPhone uses the same techniques of app sandboxing and enforced code signatures that dedicated hardware wallets use. The phone is also hardware encrypted so your funds are strongly protected even if it's physically stolen. The US DOJ even complains publicly that the phones are too secure. Some people prefer to keep large amounts in paper wallets, but for someone who doesn't have a strong technical knowledge of bitcoin, misunderstanding how change addresses work can result in total loss, so they're not really suitable for the general public. There was recently a $1M dollar bounty offered for a remote jailbreak of iOS, and the winner ended up having to use an exploit in the chrome app, so if we assume markets are efficient, then in theory it should be safe to keep at least $1M in breadwallet (if you don't use chrome).

The price of BTC will just go back up to most likely over $8000 even after the fork anyway so what’s the point of selling before the fork. Just hold for the price to go back up! This train is only just beginning 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:19:33
No, wait till it’s closer to the fork, I’m betting under 6k by fork time

@_date: 2017-11-07 00:19:01
You should be able to purchase it more than 24 hours before the fork later than that and they block tx

@_date: 2017-11-05 21:51:49
I think we need bigger blocks as well, 100% but 2X is shit and going from 1mb to 2mg is retarded. Maybe if they jump to 8mb or 16mb and keep Segwit and all that, problem solved. But not until all the developers agree upon it 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:33:30
What are you even talking about lol how are they any worse than any other wallet? Name a wallet for IOS which is better and which states clearly they are not siding with S2X. If you can do this I will switch to that wallet right now and delete this post 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:15:42
It’s absolutely a good solution. It’s like saying a penny or dime is less money than a dollar bill... all money needs an easy way to be subdivided. Especially one in which 1 costs over $7000... if you say pay me 0.000009 bitcoin vs pay me 800 bits which one sounds more viable for a future of mass adoption? Just like people understand penny vs dollar people will very easily come to understand one whole bitcoin and bits.

The imposter Bitcoin is stopping me from owning REAL bitcoin. No worries, change is coming
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:17:03
That’s because the longer chain is the real Bitcoin. Clearly it didn’t work out cause the so called “attack” was called off due to lack of consensus so the community worked therefore Bread is by proxy also following the community. Most wallets are automatically going to follow the longest chain cause that’s just how Bitcoin works... read the white paper or some developer documentation. Longest chain is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:59:45

This is honestly just too much at this point... There should be only One Bitcoin. This will destroy Bitcoin all together if one does not remain the clear and undisputed Bitcoin.

Was a long long time ago, I’m talking present day. If you’re gonna use that argument, I’ll go with something else. Why do rubies or jewels have a value? Because people deem the item to have a certain value... same with Bitcoin. It’s an asset which people deem to have value and there is a limited supply, therefore it has value. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:20:06
Because we do not have consensus to upgrade to 2mb blocks and there has not been sufficient testing or code vetting. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:01:07
True 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:18:04
The question is irrelevant. Bitcoin is designed to be subdivided into smaller units down to 1 / 100 millionth of 1 Bitcoin. People buy Bits, not whole Bitcoins. We own Bits. 
This is why the term Bits needs to see mass adoption.

Wrong, bitcoin has value by the electricity which is used to mine it, which is where it comes from and how new Bitcoin is introduced to the network. It was not created out of thin air.
Forks on the other hand is like making a xerox copy of Bitcoin and taking all of that money which is in Bitcoin and just duplicating it and calling it another name. Forking is literally creating new coins out of thin air.
Litecoin and other alts are completely different from the forks of Bitcoin.

There are plenty of wallets on IOS which are technically “hardware wallets” like BreadWallet for example. Everything is stored locally on your encrypted storage in the Secure Enclave with your finger prints etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:31:16

@_date: 2017-11-05 05:52:17
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:09:33
Well breadwallet is going to support majority hashing power after the fork, and if majority of miners support S2X that means your BTC will automatically become 2X coins instead of Real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:46:32
I don’t use ledger and I doubt it does this. I’m mainly talking about mobile wallets (which is what 95% of people use)

Agree with you there! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:50:30
They really aren’t risky. When is the last time Bitcoin has been stolen from a IPhone mobile wallet? (Not including Android cause it is not as secure as IOS.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:15:19
Don’t they have over 80% hash rate though... and isn’t only 51% needed?

Thanks, very helpful answer to a very important question that no one seems to be able to answer.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:15:01
And hash power cannot be manipulated? If you ask me groups of miners are far more susceptible to manipulation than devs and a community 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:25:46
I could buy a $4 coffee with a 25 cent fee and be good. And once they either increase block size or figure out more scaling solutions the fees will go down and down. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:36:50
Bitcoin is a censored closed community which only wants to make money and have high fees etc while compromising security and the initial vision and purpose of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:07:12
You def don’t know what you’re talking about lol they are giving users immediate access to the “other” chain whichever one loses whether that be 2X or 1X after the fork. Anyone will be able to withdraw both chains coins. Stop spreading FUD about shit you don’t even know. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:31:00
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:12:24

Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin’s value is also backed by tangible, measurable resources: code running on computing hardware powered by electricity.

Using Bitcoin without using your own full node is still orders of magnitude more secure than PayPal.

This is why everyone should use the term BITS. Especially with the price going up and a potential future price of over 100,000 per Bitcoin using the term bits universally only makes sense.
Bits = 1 / 1,000,000 of one Bitcoin

@_date: 2017-11-06 13:20:30
Yeah they are cause the higher the value that means more people are using it which means more traffic which means higher fees. 
They are directly related. This is why the fees are sky high right now compared to the penny fees one year ago.
One year ago virtually no one used Bitcoin in comparison to the insane user base we have now. Users go up, price goes up, fees go up. 
They need to scale

Again, give me the name of a better wallet for IOS which states clearly thy are not in support of S2X
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:35:46
It’s not an upgrade if NO ONE but the miners want it. No one in the community, none of the devs, virtually no one. You’re right it’s not a 51% attack, right now it’s a 83% attack by miners to take control of the future of Bitcoin but they will fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:26:19
I think saying “without running a full node you aren’t getting ANY of the security benefits of Bitcoin” is a severe stretch... 
Just because you are connecting to other nodes does not really reduce the security at all as your transaction still has to be approved by MULTIPLE nodes and accepted as valid and passed to the miners. What are the odds of the random node you are connected to along with all the other nodes that node passes your transaction to being corrupt or something else... 
IOS is a resonantly secure OS, especially the encrypted storage where your private keys are actually held. It doesn’t seem you even read the article nor understand IOS security or Bread Wallet for that matter. 
Sure a Hardware wallet or paper wallet is “more secure” but I’m not holding 5 million dollars of BTC and am some famous person in the limelight with a target on my back... 
Bread and IOS is already 1000x more secure than the physical wallet which resides in your back pocket and that’s good enough for me.

But it’s duplicated. No matter which way you slice it it’s creating something from nothing. Let’s say for example the price of Bitcoin drops to 6000 and the new coin is priced at 1000. I can sell that coin for 1000 and invest that back into bitcoin, then when the Bitcoin price goes BACK up to 7000 I now have 1000 more invested which means I have more money than I did before even though I did NOTHING, this is the definition of created out of thin air and printing money lol 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:17:29
100% they would... 8mb block vs 1mb block should have 8x lower fees. I’m not even a BCH fan and I know this.

Why do people think bitcoin is the future when it is extremely limited and transactions take FOREVER. Not to mention the fact that fees are insane, no one will ever be buying a cup of coffee with Bitcoin. There needs to be a bitcoin with zero fees instant transfers and just as secure. Oh wait there is and it’s called IOTA ;)

They do not rely on the coordinator node, in fact the tangle runs completely fine without it with other nodes running the show. The coordinator will be turned off next year, it will also be open sourced within the coming weeks.

Sure I’d like to compare fees with my bank in particular, it’s a credit union and has absolutely zero fees, not ATM, not overdraft, not transfer, zilch. Also I can use Venmo to send and receive money instantly and have it instantly deposited to my bank using a debit card if I pay a 25 cent fee or use free bank transfer which is ALWAYS in my bank the very next morning. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:40:28

@_date: 2018-07-31 03:51:55
“I have a debit card”...
Which is virtually the only reason one would need a bank other than a jobs direct deposit, and since you’re retired you don’t need that anymore... if you are working it’s very difficult to live without a bank.

Everyone needs a bank account, we are not to the point where you can live (with ease) and not have a bank account... Just don’t keep your money in a shit bank like BOFA or Chase, keep it in a Credit Union!
