WEP is a piece of piss to crack, well at least it was years ago the last time I tried it so I can only assume that it's even easier and faster now.  You're right, there's literally no good reason to be using WEP these days much less shipping modems with it enabled by default, it can be considered broken security so I've no idea why a company would make such a decision.

While there definitely exists some rather strange hostility to Bitcoin online it's not usually actively promoted like this which would suggest either one very committed anti-bitcoin person or that this is a paid message.
As far as paid messages go it's a bit general in nature, it pretty much tries to tarnish everything bitcoin rather than one specific product, service or component etc.  There's a few companies and organisations that would have an interest in pushing such a broad message but I don't really believe that any of them would stoop to this bottom tier level of obvious scaremongering but who knows.
The only people who have a legitimate reason to try and hinder bitcoin growth are Banks and people who make money through manipulation of the financial market.  Thats a lot of people and they've probably got the most clout out of any of us but they're also demonstrably bad at their jobs as a whole and every time they repeat their mistakes and cause bigger headaches for everyone else each time we lose a bit more faith in the system they've put so much work in to.
There was a time where the very idea of challenging banks on this kind of stuff would be seen as laughable but there's enough people now leveraging the technology we have in our hands that it's possible to be a real threat to an industry that's done nothing but show contempt for everyone bar a select few.
I might be more angry at banks than the average person but I think we all see the marketing and lies following some monumental fuckup on their part that pushes an idea of banks being our friends, of shining examples of ethics and reliability, as trustworthy partners to you through this difficult life etc. for what it is: bullshit.  They're savages, there's no ethics when it comes to making money and more than a few have realised they can make it out of thin air.  It's a giant festering ball of lies and deception that if let fall apart as it should could cause us huge short term problems and it's short term issues that matter most these days apparently.
Sorry, rant over.
edit: and for what it's worth as regards silk road etc bitcoin has been the first technology that can be considered real digital cash, while not a perfect implementation as regards anonymity the simple fact is nothing prior has been able to fill this void.

Not quite, there was some mention of unencrypted addresses being seized however.  This might be some sort of old log file that was kept before PGP was enforced, it might have been a list compiled from previous security breaches like when SR1 vendors got busted, who knows.
If the server was still logging what was sent in the address field all they'd have to look at is a huge number of encrypted PGP messages.  Theres no means for those messages to be decoded by anyone other than the vendor (who may be bad about security) but that's nothing to do with the site itself.

Do you regularly exchange currency though?
I don't agree with this but this is Bitstamp being extra careful not to be involved in facilitating crime.  My guess would be that they have a list of suspect bitcoin addresses/suspicious transaction patterns that they want to compare with.
The reality is nobody with ill-gotten bitcoins is going to be using one of the major exchanges to cash out with but if it did emerge that stamp were making the process easy it could be a PR and legal disaster.

Slightly confused since as far as I can remember Mt. Gox. didn't have this address I'm at now, I moved in here just as things were imploding and hadn't done any trading on gox since mid 2013.

That said I'm in no way invested in mtgox. I havent bought any coins since before the last big price hike.

$300 for a Symbicort!?
I'll have to check my drug tariff but I've worked in retail pharmacy before and I'm sure the wholesale price of one of those is under £50 ($80).  You'd likely be better off not even involving insurance companies and just dealing direct with the pharmacist who can put apply his own markup to his wholesale price.  Even with typical pharmacy markup being pretty high it's not going to be close to $300. Not sure how it works in the states but can't see why that wouldn't be possible.
edit: just checked, £33 ($50) in out of date tariff.

Localbitcoins usually has a good number of people looking to buy. Most are fine paying you via bank transfer, or meeting in person to pay in cash.
Obviously be careful, stick with established users with plenty of high rated transactions.
Paypal is a bit dodgy because of how easily the payment can be reversed, id avoid it if i were you.

Exciting times for shareholders, although I do agree that I would be extremely hesitant to buy in at this (~4.3) price.
I'm happy having got in at below 2.5 of course and would love to see how high it can go but with the rise from 3-4 being so quick there's a good chance we'll settle somewhere around 4 for a while but I'm basing this on essentially nothing but gut feeling.  I'd expect growth from here to be slower but with valuation estimates varying so much it's impossible to predict where the peak could be.
I'd be surprised to see it go below 4 again for any length of time though, the demand is there and the future looks pretty good if what's coming from friedcat holds true and there's absolutely no reason to believe otherwise.

The few times I've had payments blocked by fraud detection were for buying high value plane tickets.
My main issue with my bank in those instances was the fact they did not attempt to contact me and instead just refused to authorise the transaction leaving me to work out what was going on and get in touch with them, although I imagine this really all depends on the bank.
I've used my debit cards across the world with no issue however save for once when it was blocked upon first use in Holland.

Malware? Do you use the same username and password on any other sites?
edit: nm, you answered this.  I think most of these account compromises are due to malware but in your case that seems very unlikely.  Of course there could have been a hack on mt.gox at some point, they don't seem terribly security conscious as a company.
@_date: 2013-06-17 18:40:43
Yeah but you can easily determine if an ASIC is capable of doing its job without connecting to the network and doing 'real' work.
All they do is hash, you can feed it test data if you like or if you really want to test the entire device then connect to the testnet.  There's zero need to do real mining other than to make a bit of extra money by delaying the order.

It's very likely being watched closely and already used as such.  I'm not suggesting that money laundering makes up a huge part of the bitcoin economy but it's very obvious that it provides a pretty good means to do so and if its obvious to me then it's been obvious to those with such a need for some time.
Of course it's pretty new stuff and when it comes to money laundering I suspect there are some pretty tried and true methods in use, the faith in the system might just not quite be there yet for many.

I've not once had an issue with paypal in many years and I suspect that's simply because I've only ever used it a handful of times to receive funds.
For the average joe paypal works well because the average joe is just buying stuff, doesn't maintain a paypal balance and likely just has a linked debit card.
I realise it's anecdotal but given paypals worldwide popularity I think it's safe to say that the experience for the majority of users (buyers) is positive.
@_date: 2013-06-12 11:40:00
My experience with localbitcoins is quite different in that we have free and fast bank to bank transfers here in the UK and at any time there are a good number of people online willing to do business.
Yes they charge a premium and yes it isn't anonymous but it is fast and reliable in my experience.  The recent dip was a good opportunity to buy there because the premium above market value was made back within 24 hours.
I realise that all this is dependent on the existence of such sites and banks with this capability though, the experience of those in different territories could be quite different and there definitely isn't one solution that fits all needs.  I'm also quite concerned about the likelihood of sellers banks cracking down on their activities which essentially amount to operating a currency exchange, probably not something permitted on their accounts.  My intention is to buy in to bitcoin as much as I can as quickly as I can through this route because the alternatives are far more complicated.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:31:21
Anything to be worried about? Currently holding some trading funds in BTC in gox, not much but I sort of feel like there might be more to this.
I'm also confused as to why people think this would cause a price hike? surely increased difficulty in converting BTC to USD would cause the price to crash?
edit: ah, people think that many will be selling their USD holdings in order to move BTC on to other exchanges to cash out, makes sense.

I hold both.
If you're just curious then investing in some TAT stock isn't a bad idea, it's (relatively) cheap and you can get a feel for how the trading platforms work.
Dropping the 2.5 or whatever it is on a full share or the PT is probably pretty daunting though, certainly it was for me but the benefits are pretty obvious: no management fee, TAT comes with a 5% one which while I believe is fair is a fair chunk of your dividends.
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:23:14

Both are about equal in terms of features and ease of use, I use either depending on who is offering the best deal and have had no issues (bank transfer).

Oh lord, having read the entire thing there were multiple screwups on his part.
I suppose everyone had just assumed DPR would be more careful but if this is all to be believed he slipped up multiple times and linked public internet profiles/usernames to his activities running SR.
From the sounds of it once the FBI had access to the server image (still very interested in how they obtained that) it was game over.  Of course what DPR did was incredibly hard to remain anonymous doing but I think we all assumed he was some sort of mastermind beyond making these sorts of mistakes.

I actually think you'd stand a good chance of selling it to some poor uninformed person on ebay and cutting your losses but then that's not a very nice thing to do.
Consider it a curiosity that might prove to be interesting some time in the future, you can show it to children and explain how at one time this box was how people mined bitcoin and the measly processing power contained within was once (briefly) capable of making a select few very rich.  It'll probably look like its powered by coal.

I'm a shareholder and believer in ASICMINERs ability to keep up but you seem to have the blinkers on here somewhat, BFL are actually getting their hardware out now and while it is slow and they've got a backlog to clear they have begun doing so.
To that end there is actual competition now that will only grow in strength, especially if Avalon can get their shit together (remains to be seen however).  ASICMINER can no doubt match these efforts but it's untrue to say there is no competition.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:40:20
Localbitcoins is by far the easiest for the first time user I'd say, especially in the UK where you can just pay using instant bank transfer.  You do pay a premium for the convenience however.

It's certainly near impossible to live without a bank account in the UK.
Employers who would be willing to pay in cash are very rare and any that do would likely be on the shadier side and more than likely only doing so to avoid making PAYE payments (income tax) on the employees behalf.
I am unsure if you can cash a cheque in the UK without being a bank customer, if you can I've never encountered places that do so.
You could pay your bills without a bank account at extra hassle and usually extra expense to yourself using payment facilities in convenience stores etc but this is at least possible.
Banks in the UK don't even issue chequebooks anymore without the customer requesting them, it is assumed that near enough everyone will handle their finances using debit cards, direct debit payments and inter bank transfers.

This is pretty worrying, I frequently buy bitcoins via bank transfer using my lloyds tsb account.
I realise they may be less concerned about buying but it would be a relatively simple process to notice localbitcoins/bitbargain transactions by the payment references used.
I've no intention to sell any currently but this is still worrying.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:29:08
Yep, a few times now.  Never had an issue, it works just like localbitcoins and when I'm in the market for coins I just visit both sites and will use whoever comes out cheapest for a bank transfer deal.
With faster payments I've never been waiting long, the only delay of any sort I've experienced was on a sunday to a seller using the co-operative bank when it took around an hour for funds to show in his account.
