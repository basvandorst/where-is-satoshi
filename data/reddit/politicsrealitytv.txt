Clearly not bullish enough with the Chinese New Year and wall street bonuses lining up with the triple satoshi giga star alignment tomorrow. Here is a more accurate forecast: |

But will the bank take apart your doggo’s poo? The reserve will, might as well use them for something

You gotta choose one; your asking the bitcoin gods for too much.

Monetary base expansion != inflation
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:22:45
You are thinking of the consumer friendly version and not gdax 
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:10:38
Maybe it’s day/swing traders?
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:49:00
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:17:11
I'll take em :)
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:40:09
The taker fee on gdax is 0.3% mate
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:50:46
 you would be charged $3

250k Edit: If you spread that 4M over multiple different banks you could actually get the whole 4M covered by the FDIC

2 days!! Just took out a second mortgage but do you think that’ll be enough? Prepared to go all in on a 5:55:999 market order.

The dollar is so big since it’s international due to its world reserve status. I am surprised the euro is that low though...
Edit: it’s especially large if you consider trading tether to be the same as dollars (despite whether you think it’s shady or not) since it is tied to the dollar. Otherwise it’s just enthusiasm/interest since it’s the same as yen. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:43:06
More countries &lt; More Transactions. USD is the world reserve currency.

Guns are legal in Boston, just highly regulated. They literally can’t make it illegal...

oldyellowtruck was replying to philip not you lol.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:32:53
You don’t think that’s factored in?
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:09:31
Or one giant green candle with a wick above it three times as large as the candle.
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:26:02
Double?? Not even close mate. Half that would be an overestimate /s

Not unless they’re rich, but no American thinks I should hold on to my dollars cause they’ll be worth more in the future, that’s the key difference.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:38:50
aww I was having so much fun :/
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:14:32
see: Litecoin
Edit: Not saying it isn't priced in, but "hype" surrounding the halving and uninformed investors haven't bought in because of the halving yet
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:38:21
That’s why you set it to 7501
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:02:50
Closed above 9000 on the 4 hr

Kinky

Nortel is bankrupt now heh...

BoA is a piece of shit and they charge $3 for 3 days ACH. Who wires 3.55 anyway?
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:07:13
It’s trying again. Not sure if there’s any news behind it so I doubt it’ll be organic growth.
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:10:53
I didn’t mean that, sorry. I was talking about like license plates saying “HODLBTC” or whatever, or that Lamborghini with bitcoin decor. Those say you have crypto, or money, but so does a Lamborghini or Mercedes on its own. Of course telling people how much is in your wallet is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:55:28
Exactly I don’t understand all this paranoia about telling people you own bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:03:12
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:40:57
I’ve been in the green awhile now but it is one hell of a feeling ain’t it?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:08:50
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:21:49
I thought he was referring to 2014-2016 where it stayed at about the same price

@_date: 2019-05-24 01:46:11
I doubt they are going to pay taxes, so they really are launderers
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:12:02
You keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:31:38
Careful with we, a lot of us are here for fiat money
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:15:07
If you should do the opposite of what you should logically do, which to you is to sell using all the above logic, then shouldn’t you buy/ hold?
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:51:43
I feel like he might be dead...
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:24:51
