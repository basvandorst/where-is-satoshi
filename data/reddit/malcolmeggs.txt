kinda funny watching you say the same bullshit all the time and it never happening.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:16:01
THANK YOU! I wanted to post this on the article, but when I opened the comments I saw that someone else already had. You'd think the "MIT" Technology Review would be the last publication to screw that one up.

You start off with a flawed assertion masquerading as a question, then proceed to insult those who show you the fallacy in your logic. Congratulations, you're an idiot.

McAfee probably dropped a few on bitcoin while he was breezing through on a coke run...

Personally, I've had better luck with Patron balls, but whatever you say pal.

Thanks for the link, definitely gives some good insight into the person behind the nym. I wonder how upset he'll be when he stumbles upon the command 'woman' and finds it's undocumented.
Edit: I a letter

In addition to what has already been posted, [this bitcointalk post about the "counterparty" exchange project]( is what sparked my question.

You all act like Karpeles chose this, when in fact the court has stated that they will not allow rehabilitation to proceed. What Karpeles wants has nothing to do with it at this point.

Exactamundo! If people who got rich through bitcoin didn't expect this to happen, then that was very shortsighted of them.

Spot on with all of your replies, but here's the thing...I'm going to start applying the ["Kübler-Ross model"]( to every post about Gox from now on, and I suggest others do the same. What I mean is...while some who were goxxed have accepted the reality, assessed their own errors, and moved on; others seems to be still working their way through the "5 stages of grief" which accompany a grave loss. For a person who is still stuck at the "Anger" phase, no answer, regardless of how factual or well-worded it might be, is going to suffice. The minds of certain people will be physically incapable of accepting their own role in the event, and therefore the time and effort you've spent addressing their concerns will have been time completely wasted.

Obviously, you don't read the information which is presented to you, because the article you've referenced refers to the **Josefowitz gold** which Wikipedia has already explained to you **was a tax evasion case**. I will shut up only because any effort to educate you seems a wasted exercise.

I expect we'll be hearing much more about this in the near future, and I mean to say that the IRS is preparing to go after some people in a big way. I'd be willing to bet that most who cashed out already took the correct tax precautions, but there's bound to be a few people who thought they could sneak a couple mill past uncle sam.

Hey, I'm listening to all sides of the argument, but even in the right context that quote sounds pretty fuckin' sinister.

Why should it piss me off that some fringe political movement is not allowed to skirt the capital gains taxes that everyone else has to pay? Your assertion assumes that I agree with this "the government has no right!" logic, when I don't.

How dare you speak the truth in a gox thread!
Seriously, though, your message is accurate. There's no reason for it to be downvoted, except for spite. The truth of the matter is that the people who got goxxed are the same people who get swindled out of fiat funds by confidence schemes and poor investment advice. While I do feel badly for them, there is plenty of blame to go around. Shooting the messenger isn't going to return anyone's money...so, have an upvote!

Okay, I wasn't goin' to say it, but your comment proves it's not just me....MK's bitch tits are really makin' those shirt buttons put in some work!
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:39:39
Look at all of the downvotes given to anyone in this thread who voices any opinion against saving Gox...
So it's not enough that I'm being asked to support and help change the public image of a company which should just GO AWAY, I'm also being asked to saddle up with a group of whiny and obsessed internet trolls.
I think I'll pass.

So, my next question would be...who authored that wiki page?
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:43:23
More like Fruit Loops...

I know this post is two weeks old, but I was led here through a reference in another thread. Just wanted to say that preventing double spends was one of the fundamental design objectives all digital currencies have shared in common since first theorized. Quick Google search turns up several papers discussing the issue, like this one from Rutgers, circa 2002: [Accountability in P2P Democracy](

Please show me **ONE** piece of actual evidence that Treasury agents were stationed across the nation inspecting thousands of safe deposit boxes for PM during the 30's. I won't hold my breath.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:27:45


Not trying to single you out, but comments like that make me laugh. It's like that argument which says "There's no law which says you have to pay taxes." I'm sure you could make a strong argument for your opinion, but it won't really matter when the IRS is having you arrested and imprisoned.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:21:47
Only on reddit could someone's citation actually debunk their claim, but the person who points this out gets the downvotes. Incredible. Just to reiterate what has said, here is the specific quote from the wikipedia entry:
*"In fact, safe deposit boxes held by individuals were not forcibly searched or seized under the order and the few prosecutions that occurred in the 1930s for gold "hoarding" were executed under different statutes. One of the few such cases occurred in 1936, when a safe deposit box containing over 10,000 troy ounces (310 kg) of gold belonging to Zelik Josefowitz, who was not a U.S. citizen, was seized with a search warrant as part of a tax evasion prosecution."*
