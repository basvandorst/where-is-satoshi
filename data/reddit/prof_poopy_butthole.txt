Buy stocks like nvidia, amd and baba instead. They are alot less volatile and will probably still double your money in a year. Where as putting all your life savings in bitcoin will probably give you a heart attack in a year.

Don't day trade. Buy when every one is freaking out and/or confused (this subreddit calls it FUD) and you sell when everyone is cheering (hearing to the moon is a good indicator that you will want to sell soon).
Unless you have years worth of experience trading stocks, stay far away from day trading.

You might want to check it at 5900 USD.
And get GDAX! Coinbase is a ripoff.

Coinbase has a UI similar to Robinhood. While GDAX has a UI similar to TD Ameritrade.

It is physical gold. The only reason I know about investing in gold is because I have a great father that teaches me things like this.
