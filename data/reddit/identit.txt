A couple of thoughts; this may not be the complete picture.
In your post above, your request for help was vague--that's bad forum etiquette. I should not have had to ask what you needed help with; you should just tell us, so people can respond with helpful posts straightaway.
I took a quick look at your post history. Some of your downvoted posts were self-promotion here in This is not the place for such things. is for discussion of Bitcoin in general. I believe e.g. a vendor newly accepting Bitcoins as payment may be newsworthy here, but read the rules in the sidebar--especially 


(NSFW) is the (new) place for you to be showing yourself scantily clad, and accepting bitcoin tips for the same.
ETA: I see [you have been told this]( already.

I ~~am~~ was a mod there, and I am trying to help answer your question about how not to get downvoted. You're welcome.
You've not yet explained how your "business model" is different, other than you not wanting to show as much skin.


I didn't say anything about the internet in general. I was referring to reddit in particular.
I also said "AFAIK", meaning that ggb is the only place *that I know of* on reddit suitable for that. I'm not omniscient.
In any case, I quoted the relevant bit of the community rules for you, which states unequivocally that seeking tips in is not allowed.
ETA2: may be the new place. Give it some time for the dust to settle, as there are some open questions that need to be settled.

A couple of notes:




FYI, the symbols in the second example are not showing up properly in my browser (Firefox 25.0 on Win7 Pro SP1 64-bit). I wonder how many others may have the same font issue.
Let's not make adoption any more difficult than necessary.


Should be "฿25k" (lower case k). See [Metric prefix](

Shitty article. Bunch of over-simplifications, inaccuracies (reward is now 25, not 50 bitcoins), and bad advice. Mining with your GPU is soon to become unprofitable due to (initially) FPGAs, and now ASICs--if it isn't already unprofitable.

You should warn people that the link is to LinkedIn--especially if you're right.

How does that work?
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:15:09


Help you...how? Or with what?

Probably not a good time for this joke..

It's up now. If you want to post pics of yourself and ask for BTC tips, then post there.
And if it goes away like did*, then (AFAIK) there just wouldn't be a place for you to do that on reddit--that would not be an excuse to post such things in *Not that I expect that to happen.
