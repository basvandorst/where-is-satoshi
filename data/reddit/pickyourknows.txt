This is a different sort of investment. It's not on their normal investment platform. Even a coinbase account requires a different level of learning than etrade

Yes, the energy spend mining correlates to price.
Nothing you mentioned brings up transactions. Then why try to divide energy usage by transactions? It's a number that means nothing. Of course the higher the price goes, the more energy spent mining. But with halvening eventually it will decrease as it becomes less and less profitable, miners will drop out of the pool leaving only the most efficient

My point is that power usage of bitcoin is not variable based off number of transactions. So to show power usage per transaction is misleading and discrediting

Do other stores of value or transactional systems use less? It seems that bitcoin has the capacity to be more efficient eventually. As well as other benefits such as financial security in insecure regions

This number is misleading. Totaling up the total energy usage of bitcoin (which by the way that number is disputed) and then just simply dividing by the number of transactions is misleading. There’s more to mining than confirming transactions and the number will not go up linearly with transactions. With a simple upgrade if it becomes a problem can be fixed

Site looks like the dealership's been in business for a long time before the hurricane. Don't think it affected the area either
