To me it seems Bitcoin does not want to change the system but the rather the players. Time will tell

Are you native german speaker? I kinda doubt it. The ToS is in English and looks to be a copy that alot are using. You are registered in Cyprus and the hosting is in the US. Yeah i would not give you any personal information what so ever. Besides Credit Cards not be a big thing in Germany.

Imho for me Bitcoin is way to USA centric and geared towards financial markets. I don't need to send millions around the world. I don't want to watch a chart to see when to buy and sell. For me money in my life is not the end game. Way to much greed in all of this

Why use this when i can use a Android Bitcoin POS with any cheap Smartphone?
Unless you are selling the whole package the Merchant needs to have some basic knowledge of how he wants to implement your solution. Seems niche at best imho
