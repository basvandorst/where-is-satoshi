This is the main thing I would like to know. Trying to place an order on Bitmain, but that's its not working as they use the Blockchain API :-(

This, a thousand times! It's expensive (I had to get it shipped to the UK at a cost of approx £1/sheet). However that's nothing compared with securing £100's, if not £1000's of BTC worth.
What I love about this synthetic paper, is that it's not only waterproof, but doesn't tear also. An absolute must for long-term paper-wallets!
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:29:15
how would I go about doing that?
@_date: 2014-10-15 07:24:55
That's all very well, but reading this:  there's a lot of people suggesting that the puny 700Mhz SoC and 512MB RAM on the Pi simply isn't adequate for a healthy node.
I posted this question in that post, however didn't get any feedback. Have you ran a node on the Pi?

Lots of people saying the Pi's inadequate for running a full Bitcoin node. 
I'm interesting in running a full node, would this Intel NUC do the job: 
 ?

Yeah, I thought a European expansion of so many countries would have definitely included the UK. Surely there's a bigger market here than a lot of the countries included in this expansion! Frustrating!

Interesting, say if I did get the Odroid U3 or XU3, would it be a good idea to connect a HDD to it, or will an SD card do the trick?

I just got an invite (UK citizen here), signed up easily enough, added a UK *debit* card and purchased Bitcoin within seconds. Then tested the transfer system and had to moved to an external address, again completed within seconds. 
Have to say, I'm very impressed so far, takes out a lot of the hassle purchasing Bitcoins usually requires. And in doing so breaks down another boundary to wider adoption!
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:54:43
Thanks for that info. Whilst the price is attractive for an old laptop, I have quite a small flat, so looking for something that is inconspicuous and won't use much space or power. The Odroid U3/XU3 looks like an interesting option that is suggested below.
VPS is not an option as I'd rather pay once for some hardware I own and run it myself.
From reading other threads, average bandwidth use on a full node is approx 100GB a month, is that right? up, down or both?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:32:39
wooooooooo, i'd almost given up checking! Again, bloody typical ey, get to your wits end, post on reddit in the hope of someone fixing the issue... and it fixes itself! So releaved! :-D
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:42:37
I've found UK banks to be very Bitcoin adverse! We applied to several merchant card service providers who rejected our business due to the Bitcoin link.
I also hear SpeedyBitcoin have switched banks due to issues with their banking providers! It is very frustrating especially with the Bank of England and other institutions with links to the UK Govn't giving positive Bitcoin signals!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:53:01
Wow, that is hefty!
@_date: 2014-09-04 07:36:45
I'm with Natwest, like you waiting to see if there's been any extra fee's incured. If not then Circle is an absolute winner!
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:23:19
haha, good one :-P
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:40:00
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:30:24
its bloody typical isnt it! So so frustrating! You say there hasn't been a block in 30mins, but this transaction has been waiting for a single confirmation for over 3hrs now...
@_date: 2014-09-11 06:55:19
Very frustrating, as these are Europe's 2 biggest economies! And I know for certain Bitcoin's a big deal in the UK!
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:48:22
I thought that might be the case, but couldn't find any other way to pushtx on the net. I'll save these for next time. Do you think if there ever a several hr delay again, pushing the tx using one of those links would get it onto the blockchain and confirmed alot faster? Cheers!
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:54:58
Ok, so I incurred a £1 foreign purchase fee, in total buying $50 of BTC cost me £32.29 which is approx $52.70, which works out at a 5% premium. Will revisit if they add a native GBP deposit option.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:47:13
Thanks to everyone for your help. Guess next time I'll be more patient before panicking haha!

True, however if they ignore it or try to get heavy-handed they surely realise another country will become a Bitcoin hotspot. With the inevitable new business developments that come with it. Especially with London being known (or at least until recently) as the financial centre of the world!

I agree, if you have a more obscure currency, you change that shit before you go!

Hilarious is entirely the wrong word!!! There will be jobs lost because of this. Poor elderly pensioners will see the value of their pension pot fall due to the huge market falls. People's lives will be genuinely affected by this. So hilarious is an awful way to look at it!

gold for you good sir!

its absolute madness! How anyone falls for that I don't know, may as well wire money to a Nigerian prince in exchange for $12m!

Basically over the 2 week 'activation period', at least 75%+ of all mined blocks must be signalling for Segwit. If this happens, then Segwit gets 'locked-in'. Which means that it can't be undone. 
There is then a 2-week grace period to allow nodes/software to be updated, and then after the 2-week grace period Segwit is activated.
The next activation period starts in approx 1.5days, and currently around 82% of miners are signalling for Segwit! :-D
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:09:51
Begins in 2.5days time according to @_date: 2018-03-12 09:40:59

So a friend of mine created it, using the script creator in Google Sheets. After looking through the script editor, I can see it is as below:
    //Bitcoin Balance
    function walletBalance(x) {
      var url = " + x;
      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
      var json = response.getContentText();
      var data = JSON.parse(json);
      var price = data / 100000000;
      return price;    
And then in the cell which I want to pull wallet info I simply type "=walletBalance("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")" (xxxxx being the wallet address), very useful!
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:01:16
I agree, the quickest and easiest way to buy BTC in the UK is Circle. Small enough fees and instant both to purchase and to transfer. I only use them to purchase BTC, and then I always transfer it to a private wallet and within seconds of clicking 'send' it's been transferred to my wallet. A very solid service!
Although in an ideal world, we would have Faster Payments compatible services with even lower fees.
@_date: 2015-04-26 07:07:50
Upboated, will definitely be sure to pay it forward, thanks alot! 
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:59:17
Speedy Bitcoin had to change banks, they aren't sure how long their new bank will tolerate it. This was highlighted when I requested an increase on my buying limit from them.
All this talk of the UK being the place that welcomes crypto-businesses is bollocks. Banks here are super-suspicious and won't touch it with a barge-pole. I hope that changes soon...
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:37:42
Yeah, Natwest in the UK allow you to get a code via their banking app to withdraw up to £200 from a Natwest cash machine. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 11:39:59
They can't help, they lost their UK banking partner and can't use Faster Payments service, rather you have to make a SEPA payment to a EU bank that takes a day or two.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:19:39
I've been using this for a while, very useful when used in conjunction to pulling real-time values of certain wallet addresses, to keep track of your Bitcoin holding's value.

@_date: 2015-03-22 22:38:13
I concur, whilst the gov't may be keen to welcome digital currencies (still yet to be seen). The UK banks hate it, as shown with the problems UK-based Bitcoin companies have with UK banks!
