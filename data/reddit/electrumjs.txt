Sorry, I didn't get you. If there's flaw on my side, of any kind, I'll fix it right away.

No data is ever sent on the server, you can be assured of that. Also, it's hosted on GitHub so I have no backend code running of any sort.
The balance is determined by the Blockr API of each address, so no keys are ever sent to any server.

Little more explanation: Electrum does not have a way to monitor a wallet, but provides a master public key for "watching" the wallet. This is a Javascript implementation of the same. :)
I saw quite a few threads on Reddit, and also wanted one for myself so I made one. Very handy for Electrum users.
Planning to add bookmarking functionality, but not sure when.

Yes, that's right. But this is beneficial if you don't have Electrum with you at all times, or say Electrum is NOT supported on your platform (or whatever).
I'm planning to add support for generating new addresses and to store MPK inside the browser (and not anywhere else, for security) for quick access.

You're welcome! :)

I have not tried Electrum-LTC, so I can't confirm.
If you have it installed with you, please try it and let me know. If it works, well and good! If not, I'll check and update you as soon as I can. :)

That's absolutely correct, I've specifically used Blockr over SSL to prevent easy MITM attacks, although MITM is still possible (like with every other thing) with custom cert installed on target machines.
I am not sure why Blockr would want to do that, but yes, that's correct. I'm currently trying to remove the referrer header to end the possibility of that as well! :)
If you know a way, let me know! :)

This works for me, can you give more info?
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:47:41
I'm aware of this particular method, although nothing on the earth works for AJAX requests. I'm most probably out of luck.
Yeah, but at least it'll prevent the most obvious way out.

I don't know what 'little js' you found terrible, but would be great if you could tell me. I'll try to make it cleaner and better. :)
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:48:18
I'll try to reproduce the same over in a VM first. :)

Newer xpub keys are not supported, although if you have upgraded and the MPK is in old (Electrum 1) format then it should have worked.
Also, if you have modified the default gap limit of 5 on the client, this won't work in all cases. This uses a default of 5 as gap limit for normal addresses and 3 for change addresses, these are default in Electrum.
If you ran into a problem other than these, I'd quite certainly like to know and fix them ASAP.

Correct. Also, privacy loss is possible through the path of Blockr **ONLY**. I have no way to see your requests and nothing is logged (except visits, via Google Analytics) :)
