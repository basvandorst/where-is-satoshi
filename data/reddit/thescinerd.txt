Wait.... Is this new for Bitcoin?
You could do this with Reddcoin like 6 months ago...

What about other coins? Reddcoin is so low value that the transaction fees don't even measure on a real scale. That could change if the value increases substantially though.

The absolute number of your coins remains the same. The value of your coins, compared to different currencies, changes based on the exchange markets.

That's really funky! Thanks for the link.

I feel ya.
Check out It's a scrypt coin, and the difficulty is still low so you cane easily mine hundreds per hour! It feels very satisfying. And, tipping hundreds of coins at a time is also rather satisfying!

There are a few problems with any of these mixing algorithms. Even if the middle of the transaction is a black box, the entrance and exit of the transactions are deconvoluted. I imagine given enough time an adversary could correlate entrances and exits. This would be especially easy for an adversary that actively surveys the entire interwebz, en masse.

I like what you did there.

The tomatoes and cucumbers were from my garden. The lettuces haven't come in enough to eat. I was pretty tempted to use some raddish greens, but they looked at bit tough.

It's just a small styrofoam shipping cooler. It's sitting out next to my computer. With the cooler closed 2-3 fistfuls of pellets lasts a few hours. A bigger cooler with more dry ice would obviously last longer.
I don't recommend dry ice for cooling if you are mining for profit. Dry ice itself is far too expensive to be cost-effective.
I'm just playing around with it.

Your bitcoins are made of electrons that have been in and out of countless asses of people and animals.
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:16:44
Agreed. Even if they decided to deal in Bitcoin they would still fail trying to charge 20% fees for transfers anyone can do for free.

Good point. I was worried as well. Frost builds up on the plastic part of the USB extension, but the miner still generates enough heat to prevent condensation. The miner feels warm to the touch when it's in the cooler, which is much better than the blistering heat at room temp.

It's like any other virtual currency, but it has very specific goals. Reddcoin is focused on social media tipping and micropayments. Their new algorithm, currently in beta testing, is called Proof-of-Stake-Velocity, which rewards both Stake and Velocity (number of transactions over time). Come check it out. The community is very active, and the Devs are always around and happy to answer questions.

Darkcoin isn't even anonymous. It's all marketing. You can't stop double spending without a way to track spending! All coins will always be pseudonymous at best.

Did you try BBB with Coinabul? My order was ignored for 6mos. Complained to BBB and got a shipping notice from Coinabul 4 days later.
EDIT: The tracking number is 3 days old and still says "electronic notification received". So, not sure if anything was actually shipped. Keeping BBB complaint open until my order is in hand.

I was just looking at this and hopped on to Reddit to see if anyone was talking about it. If you look at the USD/BTC price curve it is asymptotically approaching infinity. I'm afraid the BTC value is going to crash, or reality is going to crash, because you can't really increase beyond infinity.

I am often disappointed when I go to restaurants in my city. Many people have QR codes in their windows, but it's always their website, or worse, a Facebook page.
