Cool ill check out Coinomi. Yes I am lucky to be debt free (currently) and thats awesome that you've been able to save so much using Bitcoin, especially if the price continues to rise like it has been.

are you saying that I should just save my bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:02:27

Are there taxes? I thought it was just transaction fees charged by miners, which are still relatively small.
If LTC and DOGE are severely underdeveloped then what should I worry about?

These thoughts came from a documentary I watched about Bitcoin and it highlighted Roger Ver (Bitcoin Jesus). He got fired about about governments and how Bitcoin can change the tides in favor of libertarian policy. 
I appreciate your response. What programmable aspects of Bitcoin are you interested about?
The documentary I watched was this one. The last 60 seconds is where Roger Ver looks absolutely insane and kind of turned me off Bitcoin.

Cool, I'll make sure to send tips to others! Could you explain change tip to me or point me towards information?
Thank you for your corrections... On Microsoft Word it auto corrected my spelling of Bitcoin.
