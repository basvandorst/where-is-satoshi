Oh, right. The local. That explains it.
Our "grenade" problem is pretty fucking minor. Our country is not on fire. There are two reasons people think it's a big deal. The first is that we don't have mass shootings on a regular basis, so any tiny little thing turns into a big thing. The second is "omg all brown people are terrorists".
Looking out my window, I see no cars on fire. Maybe all those grenades cause invisible fires.
Who knows ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

As a Swede, I too would like to know why our cars would be on fire.

And these grenades have killled... one person. In 5 years.
Such chaos and destruction. It's the end of our great country. Truly.

What he actually said, from your own link:
“It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,”
Which was in response to the leader of our anti-immigration party first suggesting that the army be sent in, linking the crimes to the increased rates of immigration, which there is no evidence of.
The transition you speak of consists of an overall downwards trend in crime. But there's more muslims so it's gotta be bad.

2 people killed by grenades in 10 years.
Homicide rate of 1.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016. That's *down* from 2015, and although 2011-2015 we saw it rising, the overall trend is still down, and it's now down below what it was in 2007. Meanwhile the United States is sitting pretty at **4.9**.
If you're gonna think of Sweden as "Swedistan", just remember that by comparison the United States is a warzone.

Here's a good overview.

Your idea of what's going on in Sweden is the exact opposite of reality.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:39:56


Oh, sorry, I thought we were talking about facts, not feelings. I forgot I was talking to a trumpist.


And Swedes are still less worried than Americans.
Oh crap, I forgot again! Actual numbers and statistics and shit like that is fake news, isn't it?

They're not busy fighting any wars.

He said that would not be his first option but he's willing to do whatever it takes to stop organized crime, in response to the leader of our anti-immigration party first suggesting that the army be sent in. Read past the headline.

But you are very good at just reading a headline and jumping to conclusions.

Yeah, the whole 1 BTC = 1 BTC thing... I mean, that only makes sense when you have a stable economy that primarily uses that one currency and you are only trading within that economy.
If you live in the US and your only real money concern is your wage and how many US goods that wage buys you, *within the US market exclusively*, then yeah, $1 = $1.
The second you start dealing with anything outside of dollars, outside the US market, anything that's imported or exported and so on... then you have to start looking at the dollars buying power compared to other currencies. And there aren't that many goods today that are just locked within your own economy. This only works when you are dealing only in the one economy without outside influence.
And the whole idea behind cryptocurrencies is that they are not "local". No borders apply to crypto. So, 1 BTC = 1 BTC will only apply when and if there is a stable, global market for cryptocurrency, where it is possible to live just within that market. When all things you buy and sell are exclusively "crypto goods", then you can say that 1 BTC = 1 BTC, or whatever other crypto is big then. And as much as I love that cryptocurrencies are a thing, that's not gonna happen anytime soon, if ever.
