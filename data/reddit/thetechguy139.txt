2019 is the year of adoption for bitcoin and soon everyone will accept it as payment
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:01:32
the same guy who said taxation is theft in 2008, sure why not
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:35:38
damn, you made it out good then, buying a house is so worth it after making 5x on your btc investment
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:53:27
context: 2019 is the year of rapid adoption for bitcoin, and in 10-20 years everyone will accept it as payment
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:09:57
my bank only charges $12/month unless i do direct deposits of $500/month or more, and that bank is chase
@_date: 2019-11-20 10:46:01
if i could spend 2-3 days in 2010 i would actually do several things: 1. buy $10-20 in bitcoin and 2. archive tv shows that are lost now but were airing and easy to find in 2010
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:22:46
i was so paranoid that i immediately changed my email address on everything and deleted my old email address
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:58:16
this is why bitcoin needs to be accepted because you could theoretically buy bitcoin and you could just use it anywhere and with these new credit cards coming out that converts btc to local currency is bridging the gap worldwide so most places don't necessarily need to directly accept btc if they dont want to., so the adoption seeds are planted but it's up to major banks like chase, citi, bank of america, ect to release credit cards that automatically convert crypto to local currency
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:02:50
just an email address and password, nothing else
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:07:24
i know it defeats the purpose, before it was enforced teens 13 and over could legally buy/sell crypto with there parents permission on some exchanges and the irs was not a direct threat until around 2017., nowadays all you can do without verification is send/receive crypto on most wallets but if you want to sell or buy from exchanges you need verification
@_date: 2019-10-21 06:06:37
i third that statement
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:43:53
cash app sucks, they banned me from bitcoin without any warning, do not use
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:56:34
yes they do, but every exchange does because its required by law
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:19:01
yeah because i never seen it spike this hard and rapidly since 2017
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:22:03
i knew since day 1 that you never had to buy a full bitcoin, you can buy any amount "that you can afford" you want
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:07:03
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:19
its robinhood
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:24:51
 [ YOU SERIOUS?
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:24:49
what crash? there is no crash coming unless it fails to break 16k or 20k
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:09:22
i was referring to the resistance areas, if it gets to 16k and it breaks then bitcoin will advance to 20k but if it does not break 20k then it could crash again, but if it got 16k and did not break that resistance then it could crash
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:48:24
the memes come after the event
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:55:32
robinhood, and i used ms paint to add some other details
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:55:10
every time it hit 11k i was either asleep or busy with something else, finally caught it
@_date: 2019-06-10 09:09:08
yeah but bitcoin uses too much electricity as is while other coins use a fraction of the power that bitcoin uses
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:12:05
i only have 30,700 satoshis which is 0.00030700 btc which is approximately $2.30 in usd
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:50:09
i will buy one bitcoin if i can get it for $1000
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:14:39
buy here, it's smooth sailing to 16k and then to 20k
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:26:02
he needs to sell it now before it crashes
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:17:21
use coinpot, no date of birth needed
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:41:25
use cashapp, it's the easiest thing to use and you can withdraw instantly to your btc wallet, zero fees and nearly identical to the real price
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:32:49
@_date: 2019-12-10 07:23:08
the first real wave of crypto adoption is among us, greeks will have no choice but to put 30% of there income into crypto to avoid fines
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:34:40
im new at the whole mining/faucet thing but i will learn as i go
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:46:45
just hope when robinhood crypto goes live it will surge the price so you can atleast get your trust fund back
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:44:22
me and my dad just bought .25 btc for ourselves, along with some litecoin, im really hoping the price surges when robinhood crypto and litepay goes live
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:33:58
PANIC SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:59:32
and im sure you get millions of doge
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:03:49
im going to buy between 2-5k, or lower if it gets that low
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:19:15
BITCOIN WILL REACH $11,000 TOMORROW
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:29:39
really, i bought arould the same price for 0.25 of a coin
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:42:13
agreed, especially since you have to pay tax on the bitcoin you bought and used 
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:59:09
$75,000.00 before a huge crash
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:55:26
me and my dad bought 20 litecoin for $139-140 each
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:30:30
hell yes
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:25:37
next stop: 10.7k
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:50:02
bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin are not shitcoins, its a cheaper alternative for peopke to get into cryptocurrency and the purchase to profit ratio is much higher in short term investments for quick and easy money, bitcoin on the other hand is more suited for long term and retirement investments due to the nature of how much it costs
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:14:26
me and my dad used to own some crypto but lost alot of profit due to coinbase's 7 day wait and several crashes, spent 20k and walked away with 20k so it was a break even situation
