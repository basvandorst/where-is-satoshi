They did, but they lied apparently, they said BCH would be live Jan 1st. Also yay me for taking all of my BTC out on July 31st so no free money for me. Still seems illegal to me.

Did it even break $7000? What are you cheering about?

Part of me wants to sell some of mine because its at an all time high, and I paid about $400 for a bitcoin, so sell 1 bc, and I will have more cash then I put into 2 bc, then wait for the crash and buy another at $800-$900, so back up to 2 bc and 400 extra bucks in my bank account. But another part of me thinks its not going back down and is scared to get rid of any.

Isn't bitcoin the only stable coin, like ever.

So if I make a BCH wallet it would appear in there as well?

Sweet appreciate the help.

Does your BTC have to be in your wallet before the fork happened? What if they were in a Coinbase wallet for example? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:53:50
Does this mean if you sent your BTC to a wallet (electrum) before the fork, you would have nothing in there at the time of the split, so you would get nothing from them? But if you did have your BTC still in your Coinbase wallet at the time of the fork, they would give you free BCC? 
I find this whole doubling your BTC extremely fishy, and if it works that way too, why would we not want to initiate another fork just for more free money? Tons of people together have billions worth of BTC, if doubled their money this could potentially be an influx of money thats never been seen before.

Thanks a ton, still not 100% sure if coins that were in transit to my wallet but not in my CB wallet either would still be accessible, might just have to find out myself, but I appreciate the help.

I fucking took my bitcoins out because they said if I didn't I wouldn't be able to access BCH, so now I won't get anything, shady fuckers.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:41:28
Sorry, misunderstood. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:51:30
I successfully sent my BTC to a wallet, but since there is a 2 day waiting period, I sent some before the fork, but it wasn't confirmed until today. 
But what I'm curious about is if it was in a CB wallet at the fork (or in my case on the way into my wallet) does that mean it won't be able to be recognized as BCH or just that CB itself won't allow it? I have no desire to continue business with CB so I wonder if I have BCH somewhere I can claim basically?

Ever since I moved (about 45 miles away) from my previous residence I have not been able to log into my account, I have tried countless times to get the recovery email and it would never send. I've contacted them by email by submitting a request and I get the same bullshit every time, "sorry check your spam folders, gmail might move it their automatically", and never any more responses. I'm believing more and more that they are a scam and have stolen my money. I am unable to change my password now as well as I've forgotten it, and the email just never arrives.
