All except for the fees are minor issues, not big enough problems to make a stink out of imo.
Fees are a bit high sure, and they still don't support Segwit. But to me all these issues pale in comparison to the dumpster fires that are Coinbase/GDAX and Kraken (those are the only other exchanges I've used).

I vastly prefer Gemini over GDAX/Coinbase but that's just me.
Haven't used Coinbase in awhile because I was banned for sending BTC and accused of "gambling". My mistake from sending directly from Coinbase, but I'm not fond of how they monitor where I send my BTC anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:25:33
tired of hearing that bullshit. I do use SegWit, and fees are still too high and transactions still take too long.
SegWit is a band-aid at best. it's not even a good short-term solution. it's better than nothing, but it's not going to help unless EVERYONE is using it. and that's not going to happen and we both know that. too many people are against it or just not implementing it. it has to be **default** to have an impact.

Still haven't done anything with my BCH. I split it into another wallet but it's just sitting there. Don't really care what happens to it, but if a miracle happens and it becomes more of a value to dump I'll do it. Until then it doesn't seem worth it to sell. Could always use more BTC though...

They were backed up when I signed up because there was a price rise (right before BCash) so I can only imagine now how much they are backed up in doing verification. Only thing you can do is be patient, they'll get to you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:52:47
Kind of, I suppose. If you do it right I don't see what would be so controversial about it.
What I did was I generated, and encrypted, them on a completely offline PC (live Ubuntu) and printed them on a printer that wasn't connected to the network. Digitally I split up the private key into 4 parts and each part went into its own encrypted container. Each container has the same password for simplicity's sake, but a different pin is required for each one. Then I transferred the encrypted files to a USB and to an online computer and uploaded them it to Google Drive.
So you have to get into my Google account with 2fa, then find the 4 obscurely named encrypted containers, figure out my 24 character length password, and the 4 different pins, to get my entire private key.
Personally I think that's a pretty secure way of going about cold storage. Don't think there's any wallet out there that would even come close to that kind of safety. Or maybe I'm whistling Dixie out of my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:23:24
Lucky you aren't banned. The way to do it now (which is what I should have done) is not have used Coinbase as a wallet. Instead I should have used a software (or even a web) wallet to send my funds to use wherever for whatever I want.
At the time I thought my coins were safer on an exchange like Coinbase. Then they pulled that crap, which is a good thing since it got me more involved about security and such.

I have a fire/waterproof safe coming in this week from Overstock myself. Definitely should have felt more nervous after still not having one after 27 years but better late than never.
Also backed it up to the cloud in a VeraCrypt container with a 24 character long password. Highly doubt anyone can crack that, and it's safe from just about every hazard imaginable so long as Google doesn't go under or decide to corrupt/delete my data or account.

@_date: 2017-11-01 20:25:17
No. Move it to a wallet where you control your own private keys. And then don't make any transactions during/after the fork until the dust is settled and there's a clear way to split your coins.
Use a wallet like Electrum, Mycelium, Samourai, Bread, GreenAddress, or even run your own Bitcoin Node.

good reason for me, I'm banned. awhile back received a vague statement about using Bitcoin for gambling which apparently is against their ToS and they closed my account. fuck Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:48:08
For a paper wallet you get a private and public address. The public address is the one you use to send funds to, and it doesn't need to be kept securely in a safe since it's just the public address and can only receive funds. So the public address receive funds, the private key gets it once it's confirmed. No need to refresh, it's all on the blockchain. The private key is just proof that those belong to you.
Same thing if you wanted to have a wallet on an offline PC. Just send Bitcoin to the public address generated by the wallet. Like a paper wallet you don't need to 'refresh' anything, just look at the confirmed transactions to the public addresses you've been sending to and you can determine the balance that way. If you want to see the transactions in the wallet you would have to connect it online, defeating the purpose and it would show you the same amount of Bitcoin as if you had simply looked up the transaction IDs for the funds you sent to the public address that corresponds to your offline wallet.

I've purchased way more drugs (legal and illegal) and other harmful substances with actual cash than any crypto-currency by a factor of probably 100.
Before people were buying drugs with Bitcoin on the internet we were buying them with money orders and wire transfers. There were plenty of drug manufacturers in India and China willing to send all kinds of crazy chemicals to the U.S.
Oh and we all did this on the internet and primarily on Windows machines. Using hotmail/yahoo/gmail email addresses and your average bank or western union of post office for money orders. And packages were always sent through USPS. Let's blame all them while we're at it too.

Take a look at the price of Bitcoin over the past few years, and while it's fairly volatile the trend seems to keep going up and up.
There are days where it will drop sharply, and rise sharply. But in the end it's been a worthwhile investment for me, and I've felt confident recommending it to my friends (and recommending they do a fair amount of research before diving it). So I would say the same to you or anyone else really.

It's only normal for it to "disappear" (aka discarded) if it was double spent, and for that to happen one transaction has to be confirmed before the other. The network would then discard the one without confirmations. 
That happened to me the other day after sending a transaction with a low fee, and then sending another transaction with a higher fee. The one with the lower fee was discarded.
It will get confirmed eventually, so just be patient. Right now there are more than 20k unconfirmed transactions. Just be careful in the future of setting such low fees. You can check [here]( for the amount of currently unconfirmed transactions and adjust your fee accordingly. Personally I like this site:

I used to use Mycelium, but I uninstalled it recently. My main wallet now is Samourai, it's currently in beta but it has a lot of nice features and a wonderful interface. The devs seem to say the right things (especially regarding 2x) and my personal experiences with their support was fantastic. 
On the other hand, Mycelium devs seem pretty silent and have made some questionable decisions with their app that I'm not crazy about. That alt-coin ad recently, their local trader thing. Not stuff I really care about in a wallet. Still a good wallet I would say, but Samourai seems more what I want from a wallet. And they added Segwit support recently which is pretty cool. You can also point it to your own trusted Bitcoin node (which I'm not 100% sure on but I don't think you can do that with Mycelium).

If that's the only way Bitcoin can work, then it won't work.
The barrier to entry is already complex enough for the average person as it is, just browse /new/ or the bitcoin beginniners subreddit; then you expect "most people" to run their full node on top of all that.
What comes with that are hardware costs. Most people have a computer, but there are plenty of people with Laptops that don't keep them on all the time. Sure they could get a Raspberry Pi (I foresee storage problems though), but that's another barrier to entry so that's not a good option. Plus you need an unlimited internet connection with a good download and upload speed.
For these obvious reasons, it is quite absurd to expect everyone, or even most users, to run a full node. It would be ideal, but it's never going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:02:31

If you have 1 Bitcoin in a wallet (in which you control the private keys) and the fork happens, you will also have 1 of the new Segwit 2x Bitcoin.
Without replay protection, if you send any Bitcoin after the fork there's a chance it will be sent on both chains. So if you send a friend 0.5 of normal Bitcoin it's possible he will also get 0.5 of your 2x Bitcoin as well.
So it's recommended to hold on to your Bitcoins after the fork, until things settle down and there's a concrete way to move your coins safely. Unless they magically pull replay protection out of their asses.

It does choose a node for you, but it also allows you to change nodes if you want to.
When the Segwit2x fork happens, Breadwallet will connect to a node that supports the chain with the most miners. That could be the 2x fork, or it could be the Core fork. If you want to ensure you're connected to the fork you want to support, you can manually input the desired node. If you want to spend Core coins and you're connected to a 2x node, without replay protection you might lose coins.
But if this is all over your head, I suggest you check around this sub a do a lot more reading because this has been gone over by many people a hundred times already.

sell? that's not in my vocabulary
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:00:56
and I was just asking a question
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:10:48
of course not. these rumors appear like clockwork and never pan out, never have valid sources.
IF they ever do support Bitcoin it will likely come out of left field, with not one person accurately predicting it
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:50:39
same. love Overstock for that reason.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:17:16
Of course you can. If it didn't literally no one would use that wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:37:31
No it's okay, I could have worded it better myself. No harm done.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:34:42
Of course I did. Got some on the low/high 5400s and the low 5500s. Feels great man. The only thing greater than a dip, is seeing a price increase after you spent all you could afford on the previous dip.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:11:24
definitely B
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:08:32
feel like there has to be a whole lot more to this story than that
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:45:02
I'm all right with this.

Mycelium has been working fine for me, but I'm with you. Samourai is very impressive so far. Their position on 2x is comforting as well.

try Gemini. much better exchange imo.

You can't compare running a private email service to running a full node. You don't need remotely the same amount of bandwidth to run your own email service. The biggest problem with running your own full node is that you need absolutely unlimited upload/download bandwidth as well as decent speeds for both and much more storage. With email none of those are an issue.

you have virtually forever to move your coins
as for reopening your account, good luck. fuck Coinbase, move to Gemini
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:35:59
There isn't "a" core node there are thousands of them. You could run your own and point it to that (would kind of make Breadwallet redundant though).
Here is a list of nodes: 
Just click on which version of Core you want to connect to and it will list them all. Here's the link for [0.15.0.1]( nodes.

incognito/private browsing modes work just fine for that don't they. close the tabs and there's no evidence left that you like amputee scat porn or whatever the fuck.

quality post mate

Nice! I just bought a bed frame off Overstock myself. Then went over and bought the same amount of BTC on my exchange to make up for it.
Hold, spend, and hold some more, seems like the best way forward to me.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:25:18
I wouldn't bet on it
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:47:35
I want to buy more right now as well, but I'm going to hold out on a 5-7% dip or something. Not about to buy it at an all time high.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:27:10
Breadwallet seems okay to me. It lets you change which node you connect to. Go to Settings &gt; About and then click "dl peer" and type in the IP of the node you want to connect with.
The better option would be a hardware wallet. Electrum is also an option, but if you're on Windows I would be hesitant to do that due to potential viruses and malware and such.
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:28:37
Thats what i thought it meant for ages. Still kinda makes sense.

dear lord. suddenly I want to run him over with a train

I'd bet that it's a bad time to bet on anything right now.

0.25% is fantastic but 1% is still a pretty low number. Not really much to get outraged over. If you don't like it, there are other exchanges with lower fees you can use.
Gemini has been excellent in every way in my experience so this doesn't bother me at all, as long as it doesn't go any higher.
