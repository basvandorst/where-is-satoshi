You must have read it because you saw the part about $5. Yes for the most part it seems to be a generic response but at least he/she acknowledged bitcoin so the email was read.

Litecoin may be good for short term trading but risky. Bitcoin is good for a long term hold. Short term trading any of these digital currencies are very risky though. That's my 2 cents.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:47:43
I think some of you are over reacting. Banks are just trying to figure out how to get a piece of the pie. They know bitcoin will be next to impossible for them to control. I wouldn't be surprised if they came in as some type of exchange or storage service.

Yes I'm familiar with the term and it's nearly impossible to get a case for typosquatting or even cybersquatting in front of a judge. 
Unless you're a household name like Dell, Pinterest or Apple with extremely deep pockets you have a better chance of winning the lottery than winning a squatting case. Even then it's a long shot.
There are thousands of examples of typos which huge brands can't do anything about. This is just one  If you are not directly bashing the website your squatting on or pretending to be that website there isn't anything "they" can do.

I've been involved in more than a few start ups and I've never seen any of them get it 100% right from the start. This isn't going to kill bitcoin it's merely a bump in the road. As I mentioned to another poster the bitcoin community will find a solution to this it's only a matter of time.

The number of visitors depends on the popularity of the search or domain.  You would be surprised how many times a domain is typed incorrectly. I do it fairly often when I'm typing fast and I'm sure you do as well. 
Thing is most people don't notice they typed the domain incorrectly because the website you were trying to reach usually owns those typos and redirects you to their website. The only time you notice the typo is when you're redirected to another website just like Kraken is doing.
There are business models that revolve around typo domains only and I know several people who do very well with this.

Nice car and congrats! I have a C63 and have been thinking about the CLA45 for winter. I'm waiting to see what kind of aftermarket support it get's before picking one up. I bet there is a decent amount of room left to turn the boost up :)
What packages did you get and do you have any interior shots? Also do they have a P31 type package for the CLA45?

I'm sure the bitcoin community will find a solution to prevent this from happening it just hasn't been done yet. Every new technology or innovation has 'growing pains' and I consider this one for bitcoin. Bitcoin is  still in it's infancy stages and will need to adapt.

Some are referencing Wikipedia and legal pages without understanding how things work in the real world. Not purchasing all variations and typos of your brand is a newbie mistake. It's not unethical, it's common practice.
Any webmaster with half a brain will snap them up fast and monetize if "you" don't.  We could tell people here this is VERY common until we're blue in the face but I have a feeling they won't understand.

I don't think it's the amount that is important more your intentions for the coins. If you plan on saving and not spending store those bitcoins offline and print paper backups. For spending I create a "hot" wallet with Armory on my "online" computer.

I haven't dug into it much but it sounds like you need to keep your bitcoin in their cold storage. This is a quote from there website for coverage "The insurance policy covers loss of your Bitcoins - caused by any negligence by us, or due to theft by a third party. The insurance is valid for all of our customers, wherever in the world they are located.".

When talking about equities statistics shown you will come out ahead when buying in with a lump sum for long term holds. Timing the market with equities is a guessing game. 
I would say that's most likely the case with bitcoin as well but due to the extremely volatility it's a tough call. In my opinion there is support forming here and if there isn't bad news soon it's only going to get stronger.
If I started buying today and was in for the long haul I would go with the lump sum. If the price drops a couple hundred from here that wouldn't affect me because I'm in it long.

This is common practice for any competing websites with in a niche. What's uncommon is that those typos were available. It surprises me is that MtGox didn't have the foresight to register those domains to begin with.
Purchasing all variations and typos of the brand I'm trying to create is the second thing I do after purchasing the main domain.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:21:00
I'm not sure PayPal has much choice at this point. It's either create their own digital currency which would fail or adopt bitcoin. They have a lot to gain by working bitcoin into their business.

* Website is not indexed in Google. 
* Domain registered on 2013-12-30 and expires on 2014-12-30 so that doesn't give much confidence. 
* They used private whois information which doesn't necessarily mean anything.
* Appears to be hosted on a shared server 192.31.186.19 with a bunch of other websites. A real exchange would be on a dedicated server.
Personally I would stay away.
