maybe 'complete your education' first before acting high and mighty.
you fuckin core guys cant take anything negative. it really looks pathetic on you. anything hurts your feelings and you make up some lame excuse to defend your precious coin.
it looks bad for you

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 420 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 94,920 satoshis.
still non sense?  look at the network. completely stuffed. will take days to get down to a "normal" level

Hopefully he has a bit left over (bitcoin) for a haircut

Wow. I’m amazed you even had to ask. 
This clearly shows your lack of knowledge. 
I feel bad for whatever “bitcoin” site you are running if you didn’t instantly know this is a scammer attempt.

Ummmm. Are you new here? That’s all this sub is. 
Usually they are fake hype memes hoping to brainwash noobs, but occasionally funny price drop memes are (surprisingly) not deleted. 
I agree, for a sub dedicated to “the greatest” cryptocurrency in the world, it sure is immature to look at. One would think it should be more technologically advanced minds and conversations. But no. It’s just all memes. 
Kind of tells you a lot about the bitcoin community.

You would know all about what people don’t give a crap about.
