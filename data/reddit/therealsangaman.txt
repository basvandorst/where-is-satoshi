Thanks a lot! I am the developer. The site should be a whole lot more stable now - I first shared it with others right after I'd finished it and there were still some bugs.
The lnd instance on the server still crashes occasionally due to out of memory errors, I've actually been trying to pinpoint the cause so that any memory issues in lnd itself can be fixed.

Who doesn't, and I'm sure making bitcoin scale better and be easier to use would make it's value go up. The current state is not desirable, they're growing pains indeed but we need to grow out of them.


What's your source for this? This frankly seems like an unknowable number, one that can only be roughly estimated. If a tx consumes a 10 btc output and creates 7 and 3 btc outputs, how much was "transacted?" You can't tell.


I use segwit wherever I can and I think others should too, but part of the point of segwit is that it was opt-in and I find this recent trend of blaming those who aren't using segwit quite ironic. A base block size increase guarantees increased throughput without requiring Coinbase et al to change their behavior.

Or starting with a bc1 is even better, as with Electrum.

My preference is to use bits. I don't care for millibitcoin or millibit, as the unit is not really changing. A millibitcoin is already too expensive for measuring small purchases without having to resort to fractions. Bits as a unit is future-proofed, and should you ever need to use fractions of a bit we can follow the 100:1 convention of bits and satoshis as we do dollars and cents.

It seems to me like N=1 might be the best way to go about this, what's the real need of having multiple stakeholders agree on a block?
My understanding was that the lucky stakeholder who gets to include transactions pretty much can count on the other N-1 stakeholders signing her block. So why even require those in the first place? N=1 means fewer empty blocks traverse through the network and never wind up getting signed.
Overall though I think this is a really cool proposal and I would love to see more discussion about it and perhaps implementation in an existing cryptocurrency or a new one.

Never received a tip before on here...

If I wanted to, I could put the website and the lightning node backing it behind tor, such that it couldn't easily be shut down. KoE still has a domain name and web server that can be seized/stopped, even if the smart contract lives on.

I operate this site. I could withhold payouts, and sometimes in fact this happens unintentionally because no route exists to payout the previous gem's owner at the time it was purchased, in which case I have to pay it out manually.  I can provide "proof" however that an owner was paid by releasing their invoice and the preimage to it - the only way for me to have gotten the preimage was to have paid the invoice.  
I don't think I can "fake purchases" though, and I'm not sure how that would benefit me if I did.  
Anyway, this is mainly just intended to be a fun demo with modest sums of money involved.

I agree with this, millibitcoin is clunky. A bit is almost at parity with a cent and will be the easiest way to denominate prices for common items, particularly if the price of bitcoin keeps rising. You shouldn't need to bother with fractions of bits, which is convenient. And if the time ever comes that a fraction of a bit is a non-trivial amount then satoshis could conveniently be the "cents" for bits.

Still clunky in my opinion, and also somewhat vague. Basically I think using greek prefixes for your main unit doesn't flow well.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:46:08
That's also clunky. We don't call $1000 a kilodollar.

I couldn't find any service that did this, so I built this tool over the weekend. I figure one day somebody might type $6000 into this and wish they'd bought on that date.

ETH was the split, ETC is the original chain as if the ETH hard fork never happened.
