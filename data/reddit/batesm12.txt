I did the same thing during a test a few months ago. The mistake was on me, but it was annoying that I could not erase the proposal and recover the locked funds.

Use completely random passwords with a minimum of 16 characters(uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

If in the US, make purchases with coinbase.com.  I don't have advice if you live elsewhere.  Wherever you store your bitcoin, make sure that your private key is encrypted and in your sole possession.  For security reasons, make sure your passwords are at least 16 characters and are completely random.  Enable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible.

One of the best responses possible.

Because their government doesn't want people to read "new wealthy elite" thread, obviously. [

I also view the charts on blockchain.info as being quite misleading/suspect. I have been on the search for better data for quite some time.  $2 @_date: 2014-12-17 20:57:23
Welcome. Make sure to enable 2 Factor Authentication on your account if you are storing coins with Coinbase. $2 @_date: 2014-09-10 22:35:12

I prefer this [daily transaction chart excluding popular addresses](  It throws out the 100 most popular addresses which may cause aberrations in the data.  We are roughly double the quantity per day from a year ago.  This has the seven day average to smooth the data for viewing pleasure.  By this metric, the third highest transaction count per day occurred just last week.

I did a similar thing and gave four paper wallets with between $1 and $5 on each at a white elephant gift exchange last week. All 19 people in attendance had heard of bitcoin. The gifts hit the max trade limit quite quickly.

I think you have it right. Bitcoin improves upon every single property that gives gold value.

It's a feature.

Thank you again for posting on this! Here is one accurate chart @_date: 2014-06-07 23:57:25
See my comment above. You "get it."

Your work is fantastic! Had seen a few images before, but finally went to your main page.

I disagree. This kept me from killing myself at my desk job today.  I idolize those men.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:16:08
Pretty shoddy work, really.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:15:31
It would make sense that price would rally strongly in anticipation of the halving.

Assuming your accounts at the exchanges can't be linked to you, of course.

Yes, do your research on bitcoin storage methods and their security measures.
@_date: 2014-08-22 20:13:25
Although not the ideal form of storage, when using a web-wallet(coinbase, blockchain etc...) or exchange, always enable 2-factor-authentication(2FA).  Preferably use a smartphone as the 2FA device.  Don't ever save passwords/login information.
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:30:13
One of the best!

The only one I know of is at Hawthorne and 12th. Wiffies.

Agreed.  I only go to Starbucks(and use foldapp) if I don't have time to make pour-over coffee in the morning before work.

Try adjusting your router's firewall setting to the least strict configuration.

The Venezuelan currency shown on the chart is really 1/100th of a Bolivar, and their weekly bitcoin transacted last week was only 272.  While this is substantially up over the past year, it is no where near the stated US exchange volume on localbitcoins.

Hi Matt, I have been using your coffee.foldapp.com occasionally over the past nine months.  Probably once every couple weeks.  You service has gotten more reliable over this period.  This would be my preferred way to spend bitcoin at retail locations, especially if a small discount is offered.  It is pretty slick now! My only complaint is that on rare instances it takes a long time to register a payment, which may be a coinbase issue - I don't know these things.  Customer service is great.  Market penetration may be an issue - I suspect there are quite a few bitcoiners out there that would utilize your service with the 20% discount at Starbucks.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:53:36
Nicely done! I think that is good move, as I'm not a fan of coinbase's offchain transactions.  I'll try it out tomorrow.
