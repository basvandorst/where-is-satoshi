@_date: 2017-12-27 16:03:32
I get your point if they were to all agree the difficulty would go down but think of it like gold mining the more power use to mine for example pickaxe-&gt;jackhammer you mine more gold faster but that also means everyone else will making gold
More rare

Holy shit that is amazing if you were to give a timeline when do you think LN will be released to the general public
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:36:16
What the fuck. So when you sold your Yu-Gi-Oh cards to your friends do you report the profit on your capital gains tax
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:44:01
I hope you aren’t serious right now because bitcoin has a huge issue and if we don’t fix it soon it will eventually be the end of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:01:51
If anything it leads to competition 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:33:33
Even me a bitcoin holder can’t deny that XRB transactions are pretty much free it’s crazy
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:07:11

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:58:04
I think companies that choose to accept bitcoin can open a lighting channel for a few dollars if I’m not wrong
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:01:56
Man I really hope so I was so eager to exchange I was an idiot. I hope I wake up find my ID is verified so I can send them back to my ledger and go on with my day!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:09
I mean yeah I see what your getting at but the fees are a problem a safety valve or not we need to keep our fees sub 50 Sats/byte
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:38
alright, Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:06:25
I hope this a throwaway account
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:56:14
I would rather switch to any other alt except bcash I don't support people who blatantly steal other Brand's reputation which they worked hard to build
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:39
Honestly I have no idea but the engraver pen and stencil worked wonders for me but your milage will vary I guess
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:31:03
I like Gemini nice IO easy to use and low fees
Con: 3 day verification time 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:16:27
I 100% agree with you but bitcoin is currently loosing its market share a percent or 2 every week eventually what happens to bitcoin is that our community divided while alts are succeeding. 
Divide and conquer 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:44
Good for you but don’t post how much btc you have online it isn’t safe lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:46:15
Use electrum it’s easy and straight forward and takes up like 30mb
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:21:59
It is a currency he can do with it what he pleases
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:03:27
I couldn't agree more, the problem is I was just like let me open an account send some btc and wake up the next morning and continue with my life. I just wish they warned me before sending btc. Both sides are at fault here I guess
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:51:52
Hardware wallets are open source so you can just look into the code and see what’s going on no need to fear hardware wallets
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:38:10
Well I don’t think he stated that bitcoin will be the top crypto at this point any coin could take the lead but I am confident once LN is fully implemented bitcoin will be back on top both market cap wise and tech wise
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:27:45
Exactly what I’m saying everyone wants to just dick ride bitcoins price 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:57:53
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:40
I’ll take it, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:18:55
Why didn’t you do with when they were worth 4K each 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:08:06
Man I remember seeing it and I was like enjoy the run cause this is definitely going to crash after it hit 5k I had no choice but to jump all in 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:41:46
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:57:47

Yes it is that climb means we are all getting richer together 
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:56:06
Coinbase is always locking your account very bad customer service and just not as easy to use a cash app
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:44:56
Man I am so excited 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:24
Why is it using the calculator app??
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:37:00
If doesn’t charge it just works like any usb stick works on btc and all Ethereum based coins if you loose it you can always use your seed to recover your btc. Idk what you mean by that
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:16:03
Electrum portable I have it on usb stick I also put some on my computer and some on phone with the block chain app and some on Coinbase keep them spread out so you don’t loose them all at once
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:00
Knowing that we are gonna be rich
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:55:58
Thank you so much I will look into it I just really would have liked if I could use Coinbase because they are so easy and simple but oh well to the moon I guess
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:15:03
