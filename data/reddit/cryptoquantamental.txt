Technicals are easy. It’s just that nobody uses them anymore. Seriously you’d be lucky to find 1% of any institutional money managers that use technicals as their primary tool. It’s a 40-50 year old technology. Every statistical significant part of technical analysis would be wrapped into a Quant model in order to provide scale, consistency, efficiency, and mathematical rigor.

It certainly is tricky comparing projects fundamentally. Although it isn’t hard to figure out the extremes (best and worst). Personally I’m much more of a Quant than someone that does fundamental work. Quantitative totally objective measures such as sector, github activity, and volume (linear &amp; nonlinear) are very statistically significant.

Full report is here:  
I’m a portfolio manager in traditional asset management (equities) and I wanted to take the same institutional process to my crypto portfolio.
What do you agree with? Where am I way wrong? What do you think of the method?

Definitely not fake. Random draw in a few days and you’ll clearly see it’s not fake

Total BS. The amount of tethers owned increases when people.....sell cryptos and buy tether. Shocker. It decreases when people sell tether to buy cryptos. It’s a fiat replacement. If USD replaced tether 100% tomorrow....the exact same thing would occur.
The risk is if someone prints tether without any additional demand for tether. And then uses that tether to buy bitcoin.
But that’s not what is really happening. People only get tether by selling cryptos for tether.
But even if it was...so what? Most cryptos have built in inflation (mining/stake rewards)....fiats all manipulate the money supply.... the market then takes that into account 
If tether “prints” at a great rate than the FED does then the market will devalue tether vs USD. No big deal tbh

DYOR. Every situation, both based on the market and your own financial life, is unique. I don't know you at all so there is no way I could potentially guide you.  Me personally, I'm long.

Most of the concerns are being addressed, and are miles better than where they were....but aren't fully 100% perfect yet. Take regulation and manipulation as an example.  Without a doubt there are still plenty of unregulated exchanges that can influence Bitcoins price. However, now you have Korea/Japan ramping up regulation...the CFTC is now involved, etc. 
Pricing was a concern, but isn't really much anymore given the CFTC and futures. 
The fact that it is primarily for institutional investors and there is insurance in case of hack is a huge plus.
IMO the biggest hang up is custody and the technological differences between the mechanics of this ETF verse other ETFs.

Obviously I'm not going to give up my source. Lets just say I manage money professionally and have been to the Van Eck offices multiple times. 
To be clear, no guarantees. It just looks good!

You can get your physical bitcoin via the create/redeem procedure. It would be much more secure than leaving BTC on an exchange as an example.

Huh? How on earth was I proven wrong? First I wrote this when bitcoin was 6800, and I still won’t be proven wrong if it goes to 6000. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, it moving 5% is mainly noise. It’s absolutely hilarious you think a highly volatile asset moving a couple percent means anything. 
But seriously if your goal is to scalp 1-3% you can long or short bitcoin virtually anytime, anywhere, without looking at a chart and it will almost always hit your target if you are patient enough.  That’s why TA here is such a fraud.
Obviously my post wasn’t geared to those quick volatility traders (they are really trading vol, not TA). 
My post was geared to legit actual bears. If you think we are still in a bear market...aka sub 6k, or more specifically 5k or under target, you’ll get burned. Even if it somehow gets to 5k 99% of those guys that called it will still lose bc they won’t close their short before the V recovery. That’s the point

Custody of stocks is actually far more straight forward than bitcoin. Basically for this ETF they are actually going to be storing the bitcoin in cold storage and buying/selling bitcoin via OTC.  The entire concept of cold storage is foreign to the SEC. They want to have transparency, that at least conceptually, cold storage doesn't give. The ETF is attempting to give that by disclosing exact holdings on a daily basis.

To your second point it depends on your model.  Time series or panel data is iffy with crypto due to the lack of data. Now 10 years of daily data to predict a day could work in theory, it’s enough data. I doubt there is significance though. 10 years of annual data certainly isn’t enough to predict a year.
However most of my work is cross sectional which isn’t really time sensitive.
To your first point it is incredibly difficult, in fact near impossible to time inflection points. That’s why market timers fail. That was really the point I probably made poorly in my article. It is impossible to truly know when this cyclical bear market will end. I’m not calling a bottom.
What we do know is we are in a cyclical bear.
And another we do know is cyclical markets end in V recoveries.
The V will be magnified because we are in a secular bull.
In my opinion anyone that believes in blockchain and crypto has to believe we are in a secular bull. The only other option is crypto fails and basically goes to zero. We are either going to get real world use cases, adoption and decent regulation or it’ll be banished to the history books. If you believe the first the debate is whether adoption is to the moon level, Mars or Saturn. The debate is the severity of the secular bull.
Therefore the logical conclusion is a violent V will occur. We saw it the other day (literally the day after I wrote this) of a massive squeeze. More will come.
Maybe the bottom is in. Maybe we get below 7 again. Maybe under 6, but I doubt it. 
The point is anyone that is short right now is exposed to a potential $1000-$2000 point move in a span of 30-60 minutes at any point in time. That is incredibly risky.

Powerpoint, shhh

I agree technical analysis is largely crap. 
To answer your question: yes. I do quantitative management in traditional equities so having our signals be statistically significant is quite literally a requirement. That being said for this article I kept it very high level. In equities I wouldn't do things so binary and categorical as was written in this article. In crypto we simply don't have the data to get that specific yet. It'll take years plus we need far better data providers. 
That being said it doesn't take rocket science to know we are in the middle innings of a secular bull market.

There was only the largest short squeeze in bitcoins history the day after I wrote it.
Point is anyone that is short right now is exposed to a $1000-$2000 point move in a span of 30-60 minutes at any point in time.
Of course bitcoin can still go down some. It will chop. No shit. 
The V recoveries is what makes this dangerous

Also I don’t want to say the people that think crypto is worthless and going to zero are wrong. It’s certainly a possibility. Those people aren’t really involved in crypto. And those people  weren’t really who I was targeting in my article. I was really targeting people who are longer term bulls but are trying to be a short term bear. Those folks will get burned in aggregate. Some may be able to scalp a few %. Most will lose their shirt
