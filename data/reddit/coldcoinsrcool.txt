Yes this one I totally agree with you, many people are in it to "get rich" and its the reality. Positively looking though, many who are in it to "get rich" will finally want to learn more and slowly integrate into the space to give better impact than just buy and dump. Hopefully that's the way.

Why? Spreading awareness can be done in many ways, it doesn't have to be straight facts every time. Think about those who knows nothing about bitcoin.

Storing bitcoin online is the last thing you ever want to do. It has already become so easy to hack and steal bitcoin. You can even find a subreddit just for hackers discussing how to hack. 
You might want to look into cold wallets instead. Cold wallets keep your bitcoins offline therefore it is always safe. 
But maybe you might wonder that if your bitcoin are offline, it's complicated to access it? Maybe you could try checking out ELLIPAL, their cold wallet works with its own mobile App to allow quick, seamless and safe access to your coins. 
ELLIPAL communicates via QR code, so it is also safer than other cold wallet that still uses USB cable to link up to PC. 
It is perfect whether if you like to trade everyday or if you just want to keep your coins safe somewhere. 
Maybe you are also not looking to make a big investment on cold wallets, ELLIPAL is only $39 right now on indiegogo if you use this link (only for reddit) : [  
or just watch a vdo to get a better idea: [
Go check it out! :)

If you have that many bitcoins, don't forget to store it in a cold wallet!

Ellipal is a great hardware wallet that is gaining high popularity at the moment. Ellipal wallet is 100% airgapped meaning it cannot be targeted by any network attacks. Plus, its completely made out of metal, making very difficult to be cracked open. The price is quite similar, I suggest you give it a try.

Waiting for new regulations = wait until I figure out how to manipulate bitcoin

just a thought, having Bitcoin ETF would make it a legitimate currency, big players would join and price would soar. But apart from benefiting those who already or planning to invest on bitcoin, how would it help Bitcoin becoming the currency of the future?

Yes exactly, it only benefits those who already have bitcoins and big corporates looking to invest. But for bitcoin becoming the currency of the people, it doesnt change anything. It wont become more available, more accessible or anything. Many people just get into bitcoin hoping to cash out.

They only say the good news about bitcoin, nobody ever talks about the negative stuff.
