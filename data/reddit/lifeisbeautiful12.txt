wew lad. calm yaselv. just looking for insight from you lot.

what is more likely (in your opinion) - the update going through smoothly or problems happening? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:55:34
wake up tomorrow and itll either be the same, a little better or a bit worse.

i asked this question because i am looking at the space of weeks not mere hours
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:00:28
is the price expected to jump once the update is in place? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:27:17
well clearly it is going down
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:35:45
i will probably buy at its lowest, not sell
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:50:17
what is happening on the 1st of Aug?
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:34:35
this seems to be the case , let's just hope that it is so
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:02:10
Understood, so after the update - is it expected to jump, go down, remain the same or is it more unknown at this point?
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:49:33
elaborate how my question is trolling? Are you touched somehow that i am asking a question you can't answer? shame
