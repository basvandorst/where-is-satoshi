Why subscribe to and post on a forum if you don't think people should own it? I really don't understand you and all the naysayers who are *actively* a part of this sub. If you don't like it and think we're all wasting our money, just leave it at that and we'll see who's right in 1, 5, 10 years. It's like me, as someone who doesn't play Pokemon Go, going on that sub and telling people how shitty of a game I think it is.

Seeing as how he was sued and, if I remember correctly, had to file for bankruptcy at one point, it's no surprise that he suddenly remembered having these assets.

You can disagree with Bitcoin's value, you can think it's bullshit but you can do so in a way that isn't snide and condescending. Fuck those other talking heads.

What parameters did Coinbase/the IRS use to select the 13,000 customers? I'm guessing these are the heavy traders but what exactly is the cutoff?

Exactly. The way he says it makes it seem like cryptos are some singular entity that willingly participates in illegal activities. Next, Robert is going to say that he's not investing in Apple because scammers in India ask for payment in iTunes gift cards.

It says for the bank account option "1% + $0.50." The credit card fee is "5% + 2.9%" which is closer to your 8% but is there some hidden fee for the bank option?

He says all of this and yet I'm going to guess that he's got a giant fucking stash of Monero.

I can understand why companies wouldn't want people using credit cards to buy cryptos but debit cards? Money the bank knows you have vs money the bank hopes you can pay back. One is a lot riskier than the other. Am I missing something?
