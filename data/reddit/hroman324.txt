Sign please!!! saying stop using them is so fucking useless!! if you dont want to help shut the fuck up and go and talk shit anywhere else. Unfortunately Coinbase is a big window  for lots of new user in US that dont understand what is going on.  Be grateful and help other and stop talking so much shit

Guys what about a tutorial for this
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:00:00
First of all is not my coin! and second you are an idiot!  Coinbase is basically stealing to people.  You want to do something useful... stop trolling and do something that helps people instead of pumping your shit coin

Roger is a piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:58:20
Agreed... but... he is obsolete and he needs to adapt.  basic law of nature=you adapt or die.  Especially if he is such a big shot in wall street, is his duty and responsibility to understand.

agreed ... that is what scares me the most.  USD devaluation.  I see a currency like this replacing local currencies.  But it will take a lot of time for mass adoption and we will go through a process of regulations which are not clear yet.  Therefore, there's a lot of uncertainty and risk for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-11 15:22:57
he also says that is not a spending currency and dude you can buy tickets in expedia with bitcoin.
I  was skeptical at the beginning but i actually asked them and this is what they responded:
"Thank you for contacting Expedia.
We received your email and we are here to provide you information.
You can pay for your hotel booking online using a debit or credit card, PayPal, or Bitcoin. You will pay in full at booking, in your local currency.
Thank you for choosing Expedia."

Dude ... MGTI is investing in bitcoin mining rigs and is focusing on cyber security which in my opinion is extremely important with the amount of unprotected shit we are connecting in our networks.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:56:38
did the "add non-fidelity account" poped up in your account without doing anything?  i cant find mine
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:00:39
It seems that bitcoin is spending currency after all ��
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:06:02
that make sense.  Not intuitive at all
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:49:18
follow your gut 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:20:52
I know right !  Fuck the banks
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:19:59
I have to say i didnt expect so many people to react to this.  I was reading some of the stuff here.. and it is awesome to see everyones opinions.  From all these comments, one thing is clear to me... bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is a pretty controversial topic and it will be interesting to see how things will change.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:07:29
i do... bull shit!
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:15:02
He is nuts ... but I do think he knows what he is taking about .
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:52:53
Oh dude yeah no worries... I'm just paranoid as shit ... the guy is smart but that doesn't mean he is fucking nuts.  The guy is crazy! But he is good on his stuff 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:25:14
Man i dont know about that.... but definitively is important to educate people for mass adoption...  i have to admit i was skeptical at the beginning and it was hard to find the right wallet and exchange without having second thoughts about identity stealing.  Hopefully fidelity and coinbase will fix that issue
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:08:07
great marketing

One of the issues that i see is the amount of vulnerable devices that will be connected to the router (due to the internet of things also known as IoT).  Some of these devices that are in your house are connected to your router by using your wifi for example smart fridges. However some devices communicate through rf  because they are battery powered and wifi is very power consuming. This devices have communication modules that are connected to your router and may be susceptible. As you know IoT devices are designed for one thing and nothing else ... I bet the hardware receiving signals from "your devices " may have holes or ways to get into your network, because engineers are trying to reduce the cost as much as possible. Like the wireless USB stick for keyboard and mouse connected in your laptop. 
But you know that is my opinion 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:32:14
hahaha ... so true. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:58:31
That's awesome thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:07:12
Dude relax... this should be a long term investment.  save some $ to buy in dips like todays.... i think i will buy soon i am just waiting to go a little lower.  
If you are planning to do day to day trading then the game is a little different. It depends on what you really want
