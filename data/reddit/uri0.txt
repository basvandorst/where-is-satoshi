Think of it as a giant ledger book that an accountant keeps. In this ledger book you will see transactions for example. Alice gives 5 "units" to Bob. This ledger unlike other ledgers makes certain guarantees about the transactions in it. It promises that if Alice gives 5 "units" to Bob she doesn't give the same "units" to anyone else. It also promises that now that Bob is the owner of these new units no one else but Bob can give them away. Having a copy of this book would be extremely valuable to a large number of businesses think banks, accountants, notaries.

If you have a large amount of debt and no savings inflation is wonderful. Pretty sure most western governments have huge debts and no savings.

Just like in the California gold rush the people that made the most money with the least risk were the people selling mining equipment and services to the miners.

I only have a limited understanding of the inner workings of bitcoin but wouldnt a solution be to have all of the clients updated to accept blocksizes over 1mB but not have any of the miners "publish" any blocks greater than that size. Once most of the end user clients have updated you then have the miners start to "publish" blocks with size greater than 1mB.

Took me a week last time because they unverified me after having been verified for months, both cash and online. I had to call 3 times before they fixed it. Just today i put in a bid and it got "stuck" for over a half hour in a pending state when it finally unstuck the market had moved it got put through and i ended up paying a large premium with no chance to cancel my order.

I can see how green addresses work but wont most people be transferring money from their personal wallets not mtgox or some established company with a green address. 
2-3 transactions still take 20-30 minutes. If I am running a grocery store I still don't want to make my customer wait that long. Even 10 minutes will be a hurdle to wide spread adoption.

Keep in mind some of that price rise may already be accounted for by speculation which drives price up pre-emptively.

I thought 6 confirmations take 1 hour and that it was evenly 10 minutes per confirm. Is the first one faster?

At the moment a large number of people are buying it as an investment. If it continues to appreciate and doesn't crash at some point it will reach a relative plateau in value. The volatility must decrease as the market cap increases. Just like how Googles volatility is lower than a penny stocks. You will start to see more people spend than save.

Keep in mind though that the cost per H/s should drop exponentially assuming the bitcoin world is anything like the rest of the computing world.  You neglected to mention the time factor in your examples. When bob wants to buy another 100GH/s if he does it 6 months down the line it might only cost half as much. Of course this also means that 6 months further down the line he has all the more competition at an even lower price.

They can get people to update to the latest software over large time period say a month or two it doesn't have to be fast as long as the people mining  stick to the plan. Yes it would be temporary but if you say double the block size that means we can have double the number of transactions per second. Just keep increasing the block size as long as there is an increased demand. Increased demands means the cost of keeping the full block size will be increasing but that also means there is a corresponding increase in the number of transactions and the payments associated with them. So it should balance out for the miners.
Of course again i don't really know much about the small details so there might be some massive flaw to my plan.

I was thinking how bitcoin would stand up against using cash. I realise you could use a company like bitpay but i was hoping there was a real world solution other than putting the liability onto another company.
