Let's spread BTC all over the world! There is an opinion that's BTC is going to die - let's refute it

True. It's always better to have a little than nothing. Though it's not good time for selling bitcoin but MtGox is going to fix their withdrawals.

That's always wonderful to read that bitcoin has changed somebody's life to the better. And from somebody's mother it's twice better to listen from.

Well, everyone always learn on their own way and you are totaly right about bank accounts, cause we aren't responsible for their security so the secutiry only depends on the third part competence and that's a pity we can't make additional actions to make it more safety

I totally agree. This is the best time to buy a bitcoin if you are in. But for others this is the period when we are just a viewers and can't participate in this scam.

I am also curios about all this situation with this exchange. What's the reason why people still selling their bitcoins?

Glad to see that there're guys who still fight for their truth and I can only say "Thanks guys". You're brave and you are my inspiration.
