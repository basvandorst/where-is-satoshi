Well, everybody is afraid to SELL :) But, as usual, the greediness will hurt the bitcoin economy.

I think this is a good price to buy after $170

I agree, but I don't want your coins. Spend the coins, guys, Bitcoin is too good to be used only for speculation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:01:23
Ofcourse, you will have a (small) profit from that.

If the bitcoin price keeps rising, why would somebody buy a product today for btc when tomorrow the same product will cost less?

Stop using MtGox, there are alternatives. My withdrawal of some dollars took 2 weeks to complete last year so I found a much better exchanger, at least for Europe: BitStamp

They do not want and they do not care, they are the biggest.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:16:16
Yeah, Bitcoin is hurting the environment :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:52
Somebody really wants to buy cheap coins...

ASICS will kill regular mining, but they shouldn't have a big influence on bitcoin price, that's related to the adoption rate. Anyway, people tend to forget that Bitcoin is still a rollercoaster and getting something out of it today does not guarantee that you will get even the money back for the hardware.

If you are from Europe, try BitStamp, very reliable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:16:01
It's truly amazing how stupid people are...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:21:27
It's really up to people, perhaps you wanted to get rich fast, that's not as simple as putting all your economies in Bitcoin, waiting a frame of time and after that cashing and profit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:41:43
0.001 btc? That's crazy!
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:45:21
Some stability would be good. The price of the bitcoin should be influenced by its adoption as a currency, otherwise it will be only a speculation tool who will loose the interest.
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:27:24
Really nice idea! This is the sound of the coins :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:03:55
It's not a correction, it's a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:27
It's time to buy :) Too bad I have no money in my Bitstamp account...
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:56:43
What's the point of paying with btc nowadays? The price is changing so fast and makes you think of that pizza...
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:14:36
It's too much speculation, that's the point.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:39:48
Everybody is hoarding coins these days. That's not entirely good for bitcoin, nobody wants to spend btc for items or services even for big discounts.
