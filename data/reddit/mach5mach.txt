I've had this experience with my friends and family too.  Basically, learn to convey your point appropriately to the audience you're with. If you're talking to non tech people, talking to them about the technical aspects of BTC is not interesting to them.  Talk to them about the high level fun stuff and things they do care about like getting rich. "did you see BTC is over $10k? That deflationary aspect of it must be kicking in.  Makes it a tough choice to spend though. I'll just hold onto it so increases in value." "Man, the president, fed chairman and Congress have been talking about BTC.  It's getting some good exposure."
You're also talking to people that are used to the institutionalization of fiat money. They have decades of work put into their savings. They're not going to just put it into a speculative asset that they don't understand. It's going to take time to get them to understand why BTC is a big deal. Don't be annoying about it but bring up BTC facts every now and then. 
It takes no effort to remain the same. It takes some effort to make a change. You have to give them a reason to put effort into it. Have them look at their average savings interest over the last two years versus what BTC would've done. If you have finally convinced them to buy some, then they may be interested in the technical details.

They get it. They don't want to give up that power. Separation of state and money is a huge power loss. It's not going to come easy.

The blockchain does away with fractional reserve banking.  The bank will not be able to create money out of thin air because they will not be able to register on the blockchain BTC they do not have. 
Banks can still do much like they do today. Have savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, etc.  Their role will be greatly diminished though because of the fractional reserve banking being impossible. They will only be able to loan out what BTC they currently have. In turn, either banks let go of a lot of employees or interest rates will be high. 
Personally, I think banks could do pretty well if they found a good security solution to store private keys a la the way the winklevoss twins did theirs. Charge a maintenance fee effort the safety deposit box and reap the subscription fee.

It'll be fun and interesting to hear how patrons take to it. I wish you the best. Post some stories of new people trying it out.

It has completely changed the way I look at money.  It has opened my eyes to how the wealth game is stacked against the lower and middle classes.  I now see the widespread corruption throughout media, banks and government. Building a stack of sats has become one of my top priorities. When talking to people a couple years ago who didn't see the value in BTC, I used to question if I was doing the smart thing. Now I am confident that I am and think the doubters just aren't ready to accept the inevitability.  Fiat will continue to decline in value as it was always designed to do.

It's 0 Euros to you at face value for that service. It didn't get to the other bank by magic. Either a human or machine did it which costs the company money. That's either baked into another fee you're paying or the banks are eating the cost. Prob the former. 
This is like saying I can use my CC for free at the store. Yes it's free for you to use but the merchant pays a fee to use that payment service and either increases the price of the product or service or eats the CC fee. It's the former.

Don't get discouraged. It's hard to convey something as complex as Bitcoin into a limited amount of space. I like the idea of what you're doing though. Something like this would be helpful in educating the public. My suggestion would be to simplify, simplify, simplify.  
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't fully understand it."
Anyways, let me know if you make another attempt!!

Healthcare could be a tricky space. BTW I'm from the US.  There's an expectation of privacy with healthcare and with today's current state, the transaction between healthcare service and customer is broadcasted to the payment provider.   That provides some privacy as they are private entities that limit access to payment transactions. 
With Bitcoin, it may be possible to track customer to provider payments, frequency, time of service, etc.  That may scare people away from using a public ledger for that space. Or maybe people just won't give a shit. Lol.

That's awesome. Did it require any explanation?

So what do you think the new type of system may look like?  I'm not trying to be a capitalism hater.  I realize every system has its flaws. I was more trying to think of how this tech may change our society.

Thanks. I will
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:56:15
Thanks everyone for responding. Always great to hear other opinions. Exciting times we live in.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:20:37
You have some good points in there. I agree the overall loss through lost coins should definitely decrease now that people are seeing value in it.  Could you expand on what you view as manipulative effects of fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:22:57
I've never heard about Bitcoin being the key to the spread of renewable power. Where have you heard that or why do you think that?
I like your vision though.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:30:22
Why do you think it's a bad idea?
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:27:44
Haha. Of course they'll get fun things too.
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:55:34
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:01:36
Thanks for sharing.  I'd be interested to see if in a truly free market, would a market naturally self stabilize or tend toward monopolies as is suggested by the game... Monopoly. Lol. I question that part of your response as it may be more of a logical conclusion than a proven one.

I'll try to explain here.  I view the money in an economy much like the blood in your body. The blood needs to move around in order to provide nutrients to different tissues.  Get too much blood in an area like a bleed and you won't get enough to other areas that need it. Don't get enough blood to an area and it dies. So with money, one area spends too much and goes into debt.  One area saves too much and there isn't enough for other areas of the economy.  So with everything in life, there needs to be limits. Some saving is good as it gives you funds for when they're needed.  Some spending is good as it gets you goods and services you need. If people save too much though, they aren't spending money. So businesses will not have enough revenue for employees, yada, yada, yada.
I do not mean for capitalist to equal entrepreneur. I was more trying to look at the employer employee relationship under an appreciating currency.  A better phrasing may be is private ownership of the means to production possible under this type of currency in the long run?
