Good luck! reach out if you have any more questions...

but it is duplicatable... via fork.

My limited understanding is that its a banker owned coin that will output ripple that has no/limited value and is intended to acquire other crypto as an exchange to gather and get a foothold into the crypto market at large. 
  
The one who controls the printing and supply of money controls everything. check the fed reserve.

It cant directly but its typical for whales to use a 2 pronged approach of buying/selling real btc as a hedge against the futures or as an approach to help bring the real price and the futures numbers into alignment with each other. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:54
LTC is also down the exact same amount
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:03
mining will continue. They will collect transaction fees just as they do now.

i checked it last night maybe 12 hours ago and it was "coming soon"
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:31:19
Any ideas on when they will have another batch?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:39:22
Stuck for what... 2 days?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:59
That's deep.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:20:38
so the fees don't go to anyone. Do they go back to the users? thats why im asking. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:11:51
im not sure why my question is confusing. We have already clarified that this miner rejected his reward for solving the block. the minor collects nothing period. Where do the transaction fees go? do they disappear along with the block reward or do they go back to the users who transacted in the block ledger? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:28:47
you can always make it not a part of your life if it's such an issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:45:11
Do the fees go back to the transactors?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:51:31
If you are using gdax/coinbase - then use gdax to convert your money for free on the exchange instead of the coinbase side which will charge you fees. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:22:31
I agree, let the net find it. no need to rush it. The painting one took years ;)  
  
  
if you want to tweak things or do different stuff then create different puzzles. The easier puzzles may have smaller amounts or something to that affect.

a second transaction has moved .0001 into it. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:17:09
this is only a portion of the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:07:38
The puzzle has been solved and the wallet is empty. 
Edit: not solved but moved to a different wallet: 37XTVuaWt1zyUPRgDDpsnoo5ioHk2Da6Fs

this may be true but it's worth 8.3k right now. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:26:08
I updated my comment. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:52:28
it only covers the 7.

@_date: 2017-08-27 13:42:54
this thread is about advice not research ;)
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:59:14
Agreed! That's why I was curious at others opinions. I mined a bit in 2013 and was looking to get back in but it doesn't seem the smart move that it was back then. Now, it may be smarter to just buy coins directly. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:55:10
$4000 hit on gdax!
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:14:06
Everyone here is discussing the investing side of it. What about the mining side of it? Is there any benefit to mining these days...from a beginners perspective?
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:11:58
So everyone loses but them
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:05:20
Ive read in multiple other places that that is not true. We have the key that can be used to activate the bcc coins elsewhere. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:53:25
I dont think its such a point because of the value of the coin but its worth meriting because it shows how deceiving and disingenuous the bch community is for trying to create even more FUD and misleading on even bitcoin core.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:44:24
I get this part but ive noticed the hashrate increasing prior to price elevating (potentially causing it or having causative effects). your scenario is the opposite.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:55:13
You can change your windows admin password on the hard drive in that machine with a windows password cracking tool. To be smart - maybe virtualize that drive first  since its apparently very expensive so you dont mess with the original. Alternately, you can load it into a different machine but same as your current. having said all that, if the drive is still good then your probability of recovering the data is extremely high.   
  
Separately, If its a laptop, you may be able to connect your laptop to an external screen.

The DJI was relatively flat from about 2015 all the way until trump won in nov 2016, so almost 2 years, then it shot back up in both price and volume like gangbusters. The market acceleration was even more/steeper after trump won than any time prior in the last decade.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:28:34
umh... thx.... any incite or data on that?
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:59:00
this is the right answer but im asking of the opposite. Does hashrate increase -- cause an increase of the price - which is what i have noticed in multiple occasions. It may have just been anecdotal though.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:44:51
thx for the opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:43:43
It's all about perspective. 
I don't consider mine real money until I cash out so I don't freak out with these numbers. It's just monopoly money right now...
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:52:21
That is certainly part of it and who implemented those tax cuts and regulation (red tape) cuts which promotes business growth? Also, its not flat. Its rising.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:51:19
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:36:46
This for the writeup
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:23:54
There seems to be an association with hashrate and price. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:19:49
You are wrong here. Trump was talking about the tax cuts and regulation cuts way early into his campaign and he had it on his website etc. he has a special person on the side specifically working the plan and providing details of it long before he was signed in to office. maybe you didn't know because you are  on the left but it existed and he was talking details of it long before he needed too. Speech wise, you should remember him talking about closing loopholes which was a big talking point back and forth and he made the comment on how he used the loopholes that hes going to close showing how smart he was etc.   
  
A simple chart of the DJI will show that as soon as trump won the election both the price and the volume shot up considerably in nov 2019 and the volume has remained super heavy since. I noticed it at that time because I never made the correlation before of a president to the stock market in such a direct and strong way. While any chart has ups and downs, the overall chart is up to the point that we are at a top.  Any investor would be happy to be in the market during Trumps tenure up until now. These are the facts at hand.     
  
" Trickle down corporate welfare tax cuts don't work.  "  
I agree here and that's why Trump made sure the tax breaks affected the middle class and we are seeing the results being a more productive country with a higher GDP and less unemployment, especially of the lower and mid class - Including the lowest rate of unemployment of blacks.  Less taxes and less regulation = more business and business growth. Its not more complicated then that. Lowering taxes on the rich is what is needed to pass the tax cut and get it through congress and lobbyists at large otherwise it would have never happened.

This is stupid so ill ignore.

no currency fluctuates as much as crypto coins so -any- conversion into any real currency is going to be expensive compared to that actual currency. It's disingenuous to say that it's irrelevant because "that's the way it's always been!" It's expensive now. This is a detracting problem of btc. Most people plan at some point to cycle out of btc and back into real currency at some point so those metrics have to be considered.  Nobody wants to spend an expensive amount of their money to just move it or exchange it to someplace else. It's a fundamental problem if it will be demanded that large sums compared to real currencies need to be spent just to make an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:04:50
Until hashrate adjusts and it's smarter to mine this coin again...
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:41:08
Thanks for this. I never knew there was  an actual fork called bitcoin core and ive been around...
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:50:20
so... any association of hashrate and price (the original question)?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:36:54
Why would you sell - all - of them?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:44:43
this is totally true and totally unfortunate that something like this can have such profound life altering changes ...if you can mount up and play the game. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:00:40
Maybe. I just wondered if its more than anecdotal that ive seen an increase in hashrate lead to an later increase in price.
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:20:52
that popped collar isnt helping him look any taller! 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:14:19
seems almost... obvious! Any high heat applications should be considered! 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:05:47
Why would you donate 6 cents ...you cheap bastard. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:34:37
More likely because it copied the name and the ledger. Plenty of coins are fast and cheap like litecoin as an example. LTC has a much better real world footprint as well for use as a real currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:03:27
(we hope it will recover.)  
As with stocks, past indicators do not equal future movement. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:53:29
long live bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:21:43
My biggest regret so far was to convert LTC to BTC and I missed the first run up of LTC. This ended up being something like $7k :(
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:17:45
Up like an escalator down like the elevator. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:42:34
I guess it's interesting that nobody wants to fork off of the bch chain.  
Makes you go hmmm. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 22:27:35
Clearly, that dude did not HODL!
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:52:35
Still, 12% in 1 day is no joke.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:52:35
Has he clarified what his ratio is?
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:29:01
You do know that roger very admits that he still holds btc just in case. ...?
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:48:59
It's done.   
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:07:08
then theoretically if money is on an exchange for awhile, and I send it to a wallet today, will I lose half the value since it would only be sent in one form and not both? this sounds like a huge win for whatever money is sitting on pools or exchanges.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:06:21
This is how it works in the stock market. It's like splitting a stock into 2. It doesn't mean that magically now there is 2x as much value. It means that now the value gets split amongst the new count of shares. if you could find someone to take that short contract then I would do it if I were you but I don't anyone would be that foolish. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:45:34
Theoretically if money is on an exchange for awhile, and I send it to a wallet today (tomorrow actually, I believe it splits tomorrow), will I lose half the value since it would only be sent in one form and not both? This sounds like a huge win for whatever money is sitting on pools or exchanges and a huge loss for the end user.  
please clarify if I'm missing something because I'm expecting btc prices to halve as they fork out into 2 separate coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:12:14
This was also my impression. I moved my btc to blockchain.info. I don't have the exact key but others have said that their variation of using identifier words is about the same as having the private key. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:15:00
I believe the 1st is correct. I sent mine to blockchain.info where, I believe, their variation of using identifier words is about the same as having a private key. 
Anyone caught with leaving their money on a pool or exchange is going to get screwed though (I believe).
