Which means the laws will have to change to accommodate cryptocurrencies. Otherwise, "being your own bank" will render many of us criminals.

First off, why would you trust a customer service rep to know what's up? And second of all, Visa [has already admitted]( it as their fault.

The users and miners weren't always going to hold hands and sing kum-ba-yah. Most reasonable minds don't enjoy conflict. But it came down to allowing the miners to call the shots or reducing them to being just one more player on the board and not the boss.  
Between the two scenarios, I'm okay with the latter.

If Binance incorporates Segwit, expect the trolling and brigading from there to turn up a notch.

Over at rbtc the other day upon Coinbase's Segwit adoption announcement: "This won't have a noticeable impact at all. Most people just buy and hold their Bitcoin at Coinbase."

Check the data on your article and mine. It's not Coinbase's fault.  
BTW, don't get me wrong. I still think Brian Armstrong is a flaming idiot.

Shhh, don't tell the bcashers. Remember, Bitcoin is DOOMED!

Upboat from me. I don't blame Coinbase completely for taking so long as it seems like they and Bitfinex were just waiting for Bitcoin core wallet to adopt it first. But I do agree the situation with BCH could've been handled much better.  
I still plan to use them for most of my buys and sales as I like their interface and I'm a practical guy. If some other exchange could offer me a better package of advantages, I'm down to switch.

As another user here put it, it's like calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin ABC. It's equally ridiculous.

What do you expect? We *all* would've preferred if it'd arrived sooner. But Segwit2x came along and delayed development no thanks to developers getting distracted and having to do overtime in PR. Tis no coincidence we suddenly got a slew of developments in both the Segwit and Lightning Network department in the past 2 months alone after Segwit2x died.  
But yes. It's Bitcoin's time to shine.
