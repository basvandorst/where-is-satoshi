MakerNet sounds very similar to a production method used in the Daemon series books.

Low volume though, I hope it grows.

What does this extension facilitate?

You're right that it's really hard to predict and if he's going to stress a lot about price movements he should just sell now and be super happy with his windfall and Africa trip regardless what happens. If he had access to the coins before he probably would have sold them when it was like 3x the price he got them at because omgz 300% return.


This is unfounded, maybe the hype is [going away]( or maybe not or maybe btchina will be shutdown tomorrow or maybe big funds will start investing and it'll be over 2k by the end of the week. There could be a crash in the next 10 minutes, and if you're gambling his Africa trip on that to squeeze out a few more bucks it doesn't seem like such a great proposition to me.
Imo it'd be best to put most/all of it in cold storage but if he's not that interest in bitcoin or is going to be stressed at the daily ticker then Africa's pretty cool too.

The most interesting thing I got out of [this]( thread is none of their bots could beat buy + hold in simulations. Trying to time the bitcoin market seems like a fool's errand, especially in super volatile periods like now.

Ideally it works like that. Atm they're having infrastructure problems. Been waiting 1 week+ for ID verification (they have a backlog) and their banking services tend to get overwhelmed with transactions and stop functioning. They hope to have these problems fixed by next week.

I do wonder why this isn't being talked about more as possibly the biggest application of BTC. Allowing businesses to settle international accounts instantly for free with no fraud is huge.

Eg. "I'm too poor for BTC but i think LTC is doable for me" from a recent post

 - will probably have to pay a premium
 has an AUD/BTC exchange (click the USD drop down on the top of the page). Unfortunately funding options at the moment are bankwire which takes 3-5 days or possibly wait weeks for your account to be verified to have access to the Domestic Transfer option.
edit: If you google "Bitcoin Australia" you'll find a lot of options but most charge 10-20% fees. Unfortunately I haven't discovered a low fee/vig fast option for AUD.

Maybe I did my calculation wrong or misunderstand things but it looks like it's converting it at 1BTC = $836.61? (10/0.011953 = 836.31).
In any case this is awesome and hope it works out well for you.
