Are you feeling okay?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:42:20
Good PR? Connections? I'm just guessing. I'm small a small potato so no one cares. Seems to me that more money goes into PR and damage control than customer service. They did not totally get away with it. I eventually got my original deposit back but I had to go through my brokerage service and I never got back my eth. I just got back the money I paid for it with.

In my case, the bank did not reverse the transaction but Coinbase claimed it did. This was a week after making the purchase. The coin then disappeared out of my wallet but the money was not returned by Coinbase. I did resolve it by making a bank claim. Filed a claim and the money was put back into my savings account. Then Coinbase altered my entire transaction history claiming that all of my purchases had been reversed...i.e. never happened. Apparently, I have a Trezor wallet full of BTC I never purchased anywhere. It's like magic.

Good luck to them all.

Wish I could get on Gemini. Getting verified is a beast. They did answer my support requests though (unlike YKW) and I'm not even a customer yet.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:52:00
I've given up on Coinbase support. I'm filing a claim through my bank. They said they would help me. I'm dealing with recovery of funds though. Funds coinbase debited from my bank, then cancelled the transactions and never returned the money. It's going on two months now. This is super shady business.

Don't you mean exchanges? Just warn people not to use an exchange as a wallet. An actual wallet can't freeze my account AFAIK. I guess this is a problem for day traders though. I wouldn't know. I keep it all offline unless I want to buy something with it. No trading. No need to hold on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:47:27
Go with your gut. 
I'm biased against coinbase so anything I say would be based on my very negative experience. If you do use coinbase, move your coins or fiat off their server ASAP after every purchase or sale and do not keep anything in their wallets or vaults. Never expect customer service to help you with anything because there is no evidence that it exists. 
I now prefer peer to peer transactions using localbitcoin. I'm setting up my ebay and etsy shops to accept bitcoins so I can earn them. I keep everything in offline wallets unless I am sending or receiving. Stay safe out there. It's kind of like the wild west.

So?

Have you viewed it on the block explorer? Not sure if you can tell how long it will take but you can see what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:26:02
No idea about Gemini but Coinbase is not legit. Super Shady AF.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:24:29
More empty PR nonsense. They must be receiving all those claims that have been filed. Too little too late. Don't take on more customers than you can provide service for and take their money anyway. There is no excuse for that. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:06:31
Not sure what you mean by or what the value is of mass adoption but IMO they are hurting not helping. The fact that they could have been a valuable and important  resource and chose to be disreputable and unreliable makes it worse. That was a choice they did not have to make. Too bad they don't put a fraction of the resources they are pouring into damage control PR into customer service instead.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:33:10
Even if true that their servers can't handle the traffic, no one forced them to take on more customers than their servers or customer service staff could handle. They are dealing with people's money here. There is an obligation to provide services offered. There is also absolutely nothing technical stopping them from providing at least the bare bones of adequate customer service. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:51:11
Not so lucky. I've been in the queue for months. They must not like my ID. I don't have any public social media under my real name like FB, Twitter etc. Do you? I'm just curious. Someone suggested that some kind of public info being available makes a difference but I have no idea if that's true. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:09:36
I'd love to know how people manage to get verified on any of these other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:33:02
Exactly! 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:34:10
I really hope that's true! :D
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:38:36
They are cashing in big time. You have no idea.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:22:45
Why are you putting them on Coinbase? Are you trying to cash them out?
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:42:49
After you buy the coins and they show up in your wallet, remove them immediately by sending them OFF Coinbase and into a proper wallet. Do not leave them in there.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:43:03
Best answer.

I have no idea who my costumer is. I found this clown suit on the side of the road
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:15:55
Oh. Ok. They are down the street from you and you are ID'd there so they must be okay then. Oy vey. No. There is no valid reason why so many legit users like myself have had money stolen by Coinbase. Too many people are in denial and want to dismiss us just because Coinbase is so convenient for them and they don't want to think it will happen to them or whatever reason. My situation was confirmed by my brokerage and they have enough documentation to have filed a claim on my behalf. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:28:50
They do it on purpose. Coinbase is super shady operation and that is not the worst they do like committing fraud and stealing from random "lucky" customers. I'm not talking about costing people profits. I am talking about the actual theft of money and coins. Don't use Coinbase. If Coinbase cared about being a legit business with happy customers they should put some of the time and effort into customer service that they put into PR and damage con-trolls. I would add tat they would improve their servers but there is probably nothing actually wrong with them. Don't say you were not warned. They are getting hit now with all kinds of claims and attempting to cover it up. Wonder what they'll do when it turns into a major class action suit that goes public.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:22:44
Right...as it should do. So you're admitting that Coinbase is prioritizing short term profits as the expense of customers and long term success. This makes my case for me. They are not entitled to business they can't provide for. You know what else will turn away customers and destroy the long term prospects for the company? How about taking on customers you can't provide service for, taking their money, losing their money, screwing them over, and leaving them hanging by not being willing or able to provide customer service. This practice is corrupt and lacks foresight. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:31:11
Yes. Even on some international exchanges, they will not service certain states. I got turned down by a few. All they said was that their service was not available to my area. Wish it wasn't so complicated.
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:34:14
No. No exchange is good to use as a wallet, especially Coinbase. Buy a hard wallet like Trezor or Legder Nano to keep most of your coins or learn how to make paper wallets. Get a desktop wallet like Electrum or Exodus for the smaller amounts you will spend and trade with, or a phone wallet app. I can't recommend one of those because I don't keep money on my phone. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:25:46
I would use Gemini if I could get verified. I've been trying for months. I don't use Coinbase anymore so I don't buy anything even though I'd like to.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:53:06
Since Legders have been sold out for months, I'd guess they did sell all of them. I ordered two a month ago and they won't be shipped until July so they are having to produce more. They sold everything they had. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:48:01
I wish I had a recommendation but I currently have no exchange to buy on. I very carefully buy on local bitcoins but the mark up is ridiculous there and I sometimes exchange BTC for other coins using Poloniex or the shapeshift feature on Exodus wallet. Can't buy on Poloniex with fiat. I could never get verified anywhere but Coinbase. People recommend Gemini but I can't personally vouch for them as I am still in the queue. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:44:57
There is nothing irrational about the bad feelings toward Coinbase. They earned it.  It does the community no good to cover for them or make excuses for them. Coinbase is either an irresponsible poorly run business or a shady business or both and people should know what they are getting into. We are talking about people's money here. 
Your post seems contradictory to me in that you lay out just a few of the terrible things Coinbase does to it's customers (tip of the iceberg) and why it's so unacceptable and then say people are being irrational to be upset about it. Huh?
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:43:48
Why did they take on a massive amount of customers they couldn't provide service? Nothing technical explains that. Easy solution is called a waiting list and a functional business model. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:34:27
Charlie probably doesn't want to be associated with Coinbase. Maybe he knows what's coming. Run Charlie run.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:54:45
This actually lowers my opinion of Coinbase. I didn't think that was possible.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:54:27
To all these people saying it never happened to them as though that means it's not true. I see this on every thread about Coinbase thefts. Yes. Coinbase steals some of their customer's money. It happened to me and it was confirmed by my bank. FYI I move my coins to a cold wallet as soon as they clear. Coin was removed from my account twice before it cleared and Coinbase claimed the transaction was reversed by my bank which turned out to be a lie. However, even if the reversal had occurred, the money was debited from my account and never returned. Customer service never responded. That is theft. 
We claim they took money from some of us. No one said Coinbase steals money from all of it's customers. People who show up and say it must not have happened because it never happened to them. What sense does that make? Look. This is a fact. People are getting ripped off through Coinbase. I don't know if it's some masterful hack or rogue employees and Coinbase is trying to cover it up by refusing to acknowledge the problem or if Coinbase itself is scamming customers. It's one or the other.  Go ahead. Take your chances on Coinbase. Don't say you haven't been warned and there is no need to deny it's happening either. You've been lucky. Good for you. Enough people have been robbed there that something fishy is obviously going down.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:53:24
Ok. That isn't necessarily true but I did mention in my comment that even if it wasn't Coinbase itself, it is the company that is enabling the theft and covering it up. Whether it's because they have not vetted employees properly or some other reason. The theft is a fact and in my case the claim directly from Coinbase that there was a reversal from my brokerage was easily verified as a lie. Why would they do that? It is recorded in my account. There is no other explanation I can think of except that Coinbase is up to some shady business. The level of incompetence this would require should also scare off customers.

I agree with and understand that concept. I got into Bitcoin to buy and sell with an alternative to fiat. I also hodl. I'd be thrilled with more people using Bitcoin. I just don't like the kind of mass adoption that Coinbase represents.
