I make it a habit to post only on subs where I am a subscriber and a holder of that particular coin.  Just sharing what I believe is relevant information with the community.   Feel free to skip if it is not pertinent to your exact tax situation.  Peace to you, friend!

Even though I doubt your future success in that endeavor, I’m up voting you for tenacity.

Also, Coinbase seems to have gotten quicker with its banking transfers.  Maybe it will all be settled in time.

The scariest thing in this article is the bitcoin exchange hack for 900,000 coins.

Too bad we couldn't have seen into the future back on pizza day.

Yes, all coins and tokens are currently classified as property and treated like an investment, unfortunately.

I agree. It appears the consensus is that an exchange of one altcoin for another is a taxable event though.  Some argue it could be a like-kind exchange and only taxable when sold for fiat currency. It will be interesting to see how they treat (and track if that will even be possible) these atomic swaps too.

It does say they will reflect it in their report as a sale at the current market price but is also says if you transfer to a wallet, it is not an actual sale.  They have no way of knowing the nature of the transfer so they are being conservative.  It's up to the owner to reflect the transaction appropriately and simply moving a coin from one wallet to another is not a sale.

I agree. But if they would just buy the argument that one set of binary digits valued at $4,400 is not inherently different from another set of binary digits also valued at $4,400...

I can't argue that but what the government has the power and authority to find out through legal discovery can cause a little pain.  Take a look at how they essentially shut down the Swiss (and other foreign) bank account tax avoidance schemes and generated tens of billions in new tax revenues for Uncle Sam.  They are basically using the same protocol here.  If nothing else, it will be interesting to watch how they handle things the next few years.
