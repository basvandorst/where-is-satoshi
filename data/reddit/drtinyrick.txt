Trump has been successful in many ways, especially with businesses. For the first time in history, the stock market finished the year with a positive performance every single month. Please tell me how Trump is "retarded"?

I’m not saying I agree with his tweets hkDick416 (see what I did there, I can make petty jokes too) but to call him retarded is absurd. I’m not saying he would score very high on an IQ test but he definitely isn’t suffering from mental retardation.

1. Yeah, I figured that your reading comprehension skills weren’t that great. 
2. The US is responsible for the most Wars? Really? Have you forgotten about Britain? And also, the US isn’t killing its own citizens by the millions, massive difference. 
3. The USSR was still communist under Stalin, communism requires a dictator. 
People who back communism don’t understand history, and this is why history repeats itself kids.

You're wrong though, this IS the first time the market has closed with a positive performance every single month. Obviously, I'm not the one talking out of my ass here.

Please point to a country where communism has been implemented successfully and hasn't led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands/millions of people...I'll wait.

There are many facets of libertarianism, I know what it means. Libertarian drug ideology only pertains to what you put into your OWN body (not selling drugs), and in Portugal, it is not illegal to do any drug. Also, quit dodging my original question. Point to a country where communism hasn’t led to massive amounts of death. 
1. Soviet Union- After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives became available, containing official records of the execution of approximately 800,000 prisoners under Stalin for either political or criminal offenses, around 1.7 million deaths in the Gulags and some 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement – for a total of about 3 million officially recorded victims in these categories (just one example, many more deaths occurred because of famine and other causes)
2. Mao’s great famine (China)- Benjamin Valentino says that the Great Leap Forward was a cause of the Great Chinese Famine and that the worst effects of the famine were steered towards the regime's enemies. Those labeled as "black elements" (religious leaders, rightists, rich peasants, etc.) in any earlier campaign died in the greatest numbers, as they were given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. In Mao's Great Famine, historian Frank Dikötter writes that "coercion, terror, and systematic violence were the very foundation of the Great Leap Forward" and it "motivated one of the most deadly mass killings of human history." His research in local and provincial Chinese archives indicates the death toll was at least 45 million, and that "In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death." In a secret meeting at Shanghai in 1959, Mao issued the order to procure one third of all grain from the countryside. He said: “When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.” Dikötter estimates that at least 2.5 million people were summarily killed or tortured to death during this period. (Just one example)
3. Cambodia- The Killing Fields were a number of sites in Cambodia where large numbers of people were killed and buried by the Khmer Rouge regime, during its rule of the country from 1975 to 1979, immediately after the end of the Vietnam War. At least 200,000 people were executed by the Khmer Rouge, while estimates of the total number of deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies, including disease and starvation, range from 1.4 to 2.2 million out of a population of around 7 million.
4. Democratic Kampuchea- (Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge) experienced serious hardships due to the effects of war and disrupted economic activity. According to Michael Vickery, 740,800 people in Cambodia in a population of about 7 million died due to disease, overwork, and political repression. Other estimates suggest approximately 1.7 million and it is described by the Yale University Cambodian Genocide Program as "one of the worst human tragedies of the last century.
5. Bulgaria- According to Benjamin Valentino, available evidence suggests that between 50,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed in Bulgaria beginning in 1944 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression, although there is insufficient documentation to make a definitive judgement. Dinyu Sharlanov, in his book History of Communism in Bulgaria, accounts for about 31,000 people killed under the regime between 1944 and 1989.
6. East Germany- According to Valentino, between 80,000 and 100,000 people may have been killed in East Germany beginning in 1945 as part of political repression by the Soviet Union.
7. Romania- According to Valentino, between 60,000 and 300,000 people may have been killed in Romania beginning in 1945 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression
8. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea- According to R.J. Rummel, forced labor, executions, and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 1948 to 1987; others have estimated 400,000 deaths in concentration camps alone. Pierre Rigoulot estimates 100,000 executions, 1.5 million deaths through concentration camps and slave labor, 500,000 deaths from famine, and 1.3 million killed in the Korean war. Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the 1990s famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 excess deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008. The famine, which claimed as many as one million lives, has been described as the result of the economic policies of the North Korean government, and as deliberate "terror-starvation". In 2009, Steven Rosefielde stated that the Red Holocaust "still persists in North Korea" as Kim Jong Il "refuses to abandon mass killing."
9. Democratic republic of Vietnam- In the early 1950s, the Communist government in North Vietnam launched a land reform program, which, according to Steven Rosefielde, was "aimed at exterminating class enemies." Victims were chosen in an arbitrary manner, following a quota of four to five percent. Torture was used on a wide scale, so much so that by 1954 Ho Chi Minh became concerned, and had it banned. It is estimated that some 50,000 to 172,000 people perished in the campaigns against wealthy farmers and landowners. Rosefielde discusses much higher estimates that range from 200,000 to 900,000, which includes summary executions of National People's Party members.
10. People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia- Amnesty International estimates that a total of half a million people were killed during the Red Terror of 1977 and 1978. During the terror groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down, and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers. The Save the Children Fund reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa. Mengistu Haile Mariam himself is alleged to have killed political opponents with his bare hands. 
11. Red Terror (Hungary)- During the period of the short lived Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 the Lenin Boys committed crimes against the political opponents. After World War II, the communist State Protection Authority maintained concentration camps and committed mass genocides.

It is when you have a president who is also a businessman lowering taxes on corporations. The stock market will react positively to this and I definitely wouldn't call it minimal. Again, this is the first time this has happened in the history of the market.

1. I provided you with 11 examples of mass genocide directly caused by communism, these are irrefutable facts so I see why you don't want to directly respond to them. 
2. WWII was a justified war, we were responding to reports of genocide and we were attacked first. Also, AGAIN going to war is not the same as killing millions of your own, innocent, civilians. 
3. Ah, here we are at the pinnacle of every pro-communist's argument; "That wasn't real communism, real communism has never been implemented before." This sentiment is not valid because AGAIN, the problem with communism is the implementation, not the idea. Every time communism has been attempted it has resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands/millions of people. I suggest you read a book called "The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression",
Please tell me in what modern day society would people give up the "means of production" peacefully??? Why should I give away my property because you feel like you deserve it?
Also, it wasn't state capitalism, the definition of capitalism is literally
 "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state", so "State Capitalism" is an oxymoron, it isn't a form of capitalism. The definition of communism is "a theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state." The fact is, with communism, there still has to be an infrastructure keeping the property under public ownership (aka a government) and 100% of the time this government has taken an Authoritarian stance because mankind is corrupt.

There are no libertarian countries, because if a country was 100% libertarian, there would be no federal government. However, since there has never been a libertarian country, there has never been a time where it has led to the death of hundreds of thousands/millions of people. Countries with libertarian drug policies like Portugal have actually seen an increase in the overall health of their people. Therefore, your argument is invalid. Communism doesn’t work because man is corrupt. The problem with communism isn’t the concept, it’s the implementation.

Gravity has more to do with "gravity wells" than the pushing or pulling of objects. Large collections of mass create gravity wells in space time. Everything is falling all the time because of these gravity wells.

Ah. I don’t think all of it is attributable to Trump but having him in office has certainly helped. I’m bi-partisan as well and I don’t support Trump on many issues. However, I think it’s absolutely asinine when people say that he hasn’t had even moderate success. If you’re willing to call Trump out when he does something bad, then you should also recognize when he does something good. I said the same thing about Fox News when Obama was President. This is one of the many reasons why the main stream media has a lower approval rating than Trump right now, they’re heavily biased and it’s obvious.

Saying "read the news" isn't the same as providing evidence.
