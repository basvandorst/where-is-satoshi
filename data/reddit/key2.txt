Fyi GDAX (coinbase trading platform) does the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:06:35
I meant in the way it acts...no obviously it's not a blockchain entry unless you switch wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:27
True but the option shows your coinbase balance as an available pool of funds so it's essentially just an instant ledger entry technicality 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:06:06
Except for services that enforce the going network fee rate... I have $40 of btc in a localbitcoins account and tried to send it out, it wouldn't let me send more than 32 or something to cover the fee. I'm just keeping it in there for now because paying 20% of my account is just stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:06:53
Also, chill?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:33
Literally your coinbase and gdax accounts are the same. If you log into gdax it will show your coinbase balances

Hi there, similar issue for me, case  I've been waiting 16 hours for my "complete" transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:37
yes it's like a currency, and the price you're seeing is the exchange rate. if you have X btc, it's worth X dollars, no matter where you're storing it. 
money in the bank is worth the same as the money in your wallet
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:10:06
go to bitcoinbuilder.com
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:57:49
... Because I bought it on gox
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:43:01
I feel really dumb but I am having trouble understanding bitcoinbuilder.com.
I have USD in Mt.Gox right now. So my plan is to buy BTC from Mt.Gox and transfer it to the Bitcoinbuilder site using the "Withdraw Them?" function.
I am very unsure about what happens from there. How exactly do I get the BTC I got from Gox into a non-gox address? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:30:04
at least ~29.116
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:25:53
centralized you mean?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:39:01


@_date: 2014-02-24 03:29:43
the rise from 100 was most likely because of the successful withdrawals of non-USD fiat. Unless they chose that moment in time to successfully allow those withdrawals knowing it would help spike the price before Karpeles resigned.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:56:09
not sure if this works here but:
+13 doge verify
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:49:52
yea I'm talking about in the event that withdrawals don't become available.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:44:04
It is not a scam, the guy running it is well known in the community and tons of people have been using the site recently. 
The site works because there are people who believe MtGox is not going to go bankrupt and are willing to trade their non-gox BTC for people with Gox BTC. Since Gox BTC are so much cheaper, people with Real BTC have the chance to get more for their money, as long as Mt Gox doesn't go under. 
For people with Gox BTC, it's a chance at safety while making a bit of $ through arbitrage. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:15:26
Yea I figured it out after looking at it again - thanks for the confirmation I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:13:20
~30btc but I picked them up at 100. still not fun but I knew the risk
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:57:03
I had no idea, sorry 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:21:12
thanks man, unfortunately I think the doge is banned on r/bitcoin. maybe we'll cross paths on a different moon. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:01:13
MtGox was holding fiat withdrawals. This caused people to want to exchange their fiat into BTC on MtGox in order to move the money out of MtGox (and to another exchange presumably, which is unfortunate because it creates a negative arbitrage situation for people wanting to leave MtGox). The increased buy orders from that scenario drove the price up on MtGox but not other exchanges since the problem didn't exist there.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:50:27
MtGox has frozen BTC withdrawals so you can't do this at all. The only way to get some kind of arbitrage is through bitcoinbuilder.com and even that window is closing bit by bit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:52:36
ok makes sense. 
I'm seeing sales on bitcoinbuilder at like "10 GoxBTC for .7 btc/ea" which means I'm selling my $300/btc coins at .7 the rate on bitstamp, right (roughly $450/btc)?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:08:55
I did - I set it to buy overnight and woke up and was really happy, then sad, then confused, then more sad, then a mixture of hope and self-loathing, then more stuff. now I'm hungry
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:08:41
There are three players: You, Bitcoinbuilder, and some random person with Real BTC who wants to buy btc on MtGox for cheap because they believe Gox is fine and price will shoot up when withdrawals are allowed:
1. You have Gox BTC and you want Real BTC. 
2. You send your Gox BTC to the bitcoinbuilder Gox public key (Gox BTC deposit address). This address is still inside Gox's system, so no coins have left Gox, it's just moving from your Gox address to Bitcoinbuilder's.
3. You now have BTC inside of Bitcoinbuilder's Gox address.
4. Someone with real BTC who wants to buy Gox BTC goes to bitcoinbuilder.com
5. They buy your Gox BTC from Bitcoinbuilder's gox account with their real BTC. To do this, they send real BTC to Bitcoinbuilder's non-gox account. This is kind of like escrow.
6. Now bitcoinbuilder has your Gox BTC in their Gox account, and a random person's Real BTC in their Real account. 
7. Bitcoinbuilder takes a 2% transaction fee, and then makes the swap for Real and Gox BTC, transferring your Gox BTC to the random person's gox account (so those BTC never actually left Gox, they just changed ownership within Gox), and transferring the random person's real BTC to your "RealBTC" deposit address on bitcoinbuilder. 
8. Then you withdraw your BTC from bitcoinbuilder.com to the address you provided when you got verified.
That might have been confusing - let me know. I was having a lot of trouble with this too over the past few days but figured it out. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:16:28
correct. no BTC is coming out of Gox, but it can move within Gox freely 
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:37:52
his account is 5 years old so unless this scam was 5 years in the making, I think we're good?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:42:16
We've initiated the landing sequence!
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:50:50
I think more-so transparency than regulation. MtGox gave repeated signals that they were not on top of things (no staging server for site updates...are you crazy?). 
Also it's a free market and no one is stopping an independent entity from offering insurance. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:18:45
thanks man. I was the one who gave that guy doge but I'm not sure if the bot works outside r/dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:56:32
yes you did misunderstand. although they said they're working on a solution, they said we'd have to wait until Thursday (latest) for a real update on the situation. They hope to begin allowing withdrawals soon but nothing has been guaranteed. It's all still unknown. Hence the reason the price is still much lower on Gox than the other exchanges. Getting your coins out is only possible right now through bitcoinbuilder.com but the arbitrage spread is not as high by doing that. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:24:42
I'm just hoping it goes down more, then I'll just use bitcoinbuilder.com to get it out
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:47:31

@_date: 2017-10-06 15:05:27
question - I moved my coins to blockchain.info - it's essentially the same thing right aside from the better security of a hardware wallet? As far as forks are concerned? I also know that using Blockchain.info technically makes you trust them with your info (keys not completely in my possession) but they seems to be generally trusted. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:53:00
Once you move coins to a wallet, how do you get the coins from a fork?

@_date: 2013-04-03 13:03:24
does this apply to blockchain.info? I'm pretty sure the only way to get access to someone's account on that is to have their passwords since nothing is stored on their servers, right?

seriously. bitcointip mining is the new mining market. as easy as it makes transactions, it makes it just as easy to scam on here. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:24:54
I actually had a bunch of cash sitting in there and just bit the bullet and spent everything so I have bitcoins now. I just need to find the best place to put the BTC now where I can actually convert them to fiat when and if necessary. Agreed I don't trust mtgox right now - I bought pretty high today but I'm a holder so I'm okay with sitting on it until a more liquid solution comes along to the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:16:17
but the Mtgox charges 1000 Yen bank fee each time which is roughly USD 13. Coinbase seems to be an account link, not a transfer, so Coinbase actually makes the debit transaction itself, rather than you transferring funds into a Coinbase account and then buying btc from there
@_date: 2013-03-10 11:32:27
I backed up to Google drive - is that the same? What happens when the servers go down - is everything lost?
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:11:31
Done, thanks. Could you also post the results when complete?
@_date: 2013-03-10 11:34:38
I checked that out but you need to first transfer your money into a bank account and only after that you can make trades. I'd prefer to just make a straight trade. Transaction fees for transfer are like $60. 
I've contacted people in the city I'm in now about meeting up and exchanging cash for btc. Is there any etiquette for discussing sell rates when meeting with someone? Can you give an offer and negotiate?
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:19:40
thank you so much, this community is awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:01:54
Ok, thanks for explaining 
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:54:02
so essentially - I don't ever have to know my private key if I use Blockchain right? Therefore isn't it less safe because all someone would need to do is get my password to the website or steal my phone?
@_date: 2013-04-17 10:48:30
Heh...nothing yet, but I don't actively promote either. I just use it for It's more of a 'just in case someone for some reason really likes my music, they can send me a bitcent or two'
@_date: 2013-03-12 10:55:52
Transparency in the system is a beautiful thing! I'm flabbergasted at how quickly this was amended. I have been heavily into BTC for about a week now reading and researching and if anything this shows me that there is an integrity to the system that trumps centralized currencies. Today was a true win for BTC. Even though mine went down in value slightly I have no doubt it will bounce back. Very cool thing to be a part of today. The IRC was going wild.
@_date: 2013-03-10 15:01:54
Question for anyone here:
It seems MtGox requires you to actually transfer funds from a bank first in order to buy BTC, wheres Coinbase is like purchasing with a debit card. To me, that would make Coinbase the better option since I wouldn't have to pay a bank transfer fee to buy BTC first. Am I correct?
@_date: 2013-03-10 12:03:30
ok great.  thanks
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:19:39
my password is 30+ characters so I don't think it can be brute forced, plus I have 2 factor authentication. so if this site was hacked, would I still be reasonably safe?
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:08:43
I've had my public key listed on my Soundcloud for a while for donations... It's like internet busking 
@_date: 2013-03-10 05:43:14
thank you so much, definitely planning to pay it forward and contribute as much as I can
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:15:33
Are you using email authentication? It says each code can be used for 24 hours
edit: However I do find (I use Google Authenticator app) that sometimes when I visit the site, the input field for the code simply doesn't show up and I can just type in my regular password to access, but I think it does that because of cache. not really sure though and it is a bit worrying if it's not supposed to do that.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:31:19
I wish buying them was easier. I opened mtgox account yesterday and now have to wait days for my small transfer to make it in. I wanted to buy like 4 btc now I'll be able to buy 3 or less by the time the funds arrive. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:11:15
Same - I work with a small digital production agency and we still accept BTC for jobs
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:58:14
What if you have 2-factor authentication? Like using the Google authenticator app? Wouldn't someone have to actually steal your phone? 
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:21:07
ok - thanks for responding.

@_date: 2013-03-10 06:38:32
Awesome, thanks for the succinct reply it's very helpful. I have one more question now:
I read on here that people will transfer their btc to a new paper wallet after every transaction. You said people keep their private keys in safety deposit boxes or safes - so every time they want to send btc from that wallet, they have to 
-get the physical paper
-scan the QR or type in the key that's on the paper
-send btc to someone
-then generate a new paper wallet
-send the remainder of their btc to the new wallet, rinse and repeat? 
Or is it safe enough to just keep the paper wallet safe and use one?
So let me see if I have this correct for the use of paper wallet.
* I go to the website you gave me and follow the instructions for creating a paper wallet
* I may or may not sync the public key from that paper wallet to my current blockchain account, where I will have the ability to see the funds in that wallet but not be able to do anything with them
* I can keep the public key QR code/written key on me at all times so I can receive btc from anyone.
I am guessing that paper wallets are not really for spending - more for holding large sums. Then when I want to purchase something I transfer a smaller amount to one of my digital wallets (like on blockchain) and make the payment from there.
And there is a .005 btc fee for transfering from the paper wallet to the digital wallet, and then another .005 btc fee for transferring to someone else's account?
Sorry for the long-windedness, and thanks for your response. I'm definitely understanding much better now. I'm not the ost tech-savvy person so I'm worrying myself with the amount of security I need to protect myself with, but I'd rather err on the side of precaution. 
edit: and yes, SGD is Singapore dollars. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:01:31
just checking
@_date: 2013-03-10 05:35:19
wait - I just post my public key in this thread?
@_date: 2013-03-11 13:32:10
Do you use your paper wallet for all transactions or just to keep your btc? Also is there a transaction fee every time you want to transfer to and from your paper wallet?
I'm thinking about getting one but I don't really understand how to use them yet. Do I just print, keep the public key in my wallet or something, and keep the private key hidden at home or locked away? 
How do people send money to your public key? Do they just scan your QR code?
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:56:57
really late to this thread, just doing some research on this topic - I'm wondering how the above actually happened? Did you actually just get sent btc through a reddit post?
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:37:45
I just woke up and dammit
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:36:53
It's a bubble! Everyone out quickly!! 
@_date: 2013-03-24 09:30:53
Ok so maybe I can plan to use them in the future once they get sorted out. Their fees are higher than MtGox though aren't they?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:49:42
Well yea i should probably revise: check mail, check weather, monitor bitcoin and let my girlfriend know the price every 3 minutes 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:05:32
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-03-10 05:35:51
how does this work?!
and thank you this is amazing
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:19:25
Dude you have access to your online wallet that shows the transaction - the BTC exchange rate is public knowledge. file a police report - YOU HAVE PROOF. You did an online transfer of funds which you have proof of - same as a bank transfer. Go to the police and report it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:53:38

@_date: 2013-03-10 03:20:40
Hey - so are you saying after every transaction you make, it's good practice to send the remaining funds in that wallet to a new wallet? 
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:14:07
Ok - thanks for your help. I'm now trying to understand paper wallets. Is it possible to use a paper wallet public key on my phone and then just have the private key on paper for when I need to send coins? How would I do that if it's possible? 
Or rather - what is the most popular way people use paper wallets?

Same here - when I first started researching I had a post asking two last questions before I took the dive into my first purchase - was looking to buy a small amount just to see how wallets and online transactions worked and stuff. The first two replies to my post were tips, it was amazing. There's so much optimism and helpfulness here it's great.
@_date: 2013-03-10 08:00:24
thanks, this is great. I've also been reading bitcointalk forums for a while
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:21:22
No way - even if it shoots up it's not worth it - 1, you'll be a nervous wreck, and 2, other people depend on this money, not just you. And they have no say in it - so you have a duty to make sure they are taken care of. And with $200 to invest you won't me making any life-changing gains any time soon. I would say stay safe. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:55:07
would this affect BTC I have sitting in MtGox or just fiat?

ok, will check it out
@_date: 2013-03-10 08:27:28
I have an online-only bank in the US but not a lot of money in it, like less than 1000. If I'm only buying a few hundred of bitcoin, I would still have to pay a bank transfer fee in the US (right?) which I think can be like $60 or so. To me that doesn't seem worth it. I might just try to meet up with someone in my local area and buy for cash. I'm not in SG or the US right now so a bit difficult.
@_date: 2013-03-10 08:03:16
ok yea - I actually feel pretty safe with just the blockchain account I have, but I really am ignorant when it comes to security for the most part. I have 2-step authorization and 2 passwords on my account - is it still necessary to switch funds from one wallet to a new one after every transaction? 
I really want to buy a few hundred $$ worth of bitcoins soon if I can find a good SGD seller (I looked on the site you sent and one was selling for over $11 above market rate..not sure if that's normal). 
Thanks for your info and help, I really appreciate it.

especially with the big Olive Garden thing yesterday. Even though one of hte Reddit employees said he thought it was legit - doesn't change the fact that there are industry insiders in that thread saying they know for undeniable fact that this happens. Bitcoin-tips should be used for stuff that is very helpful. Anything emotionally driven should be approached with caution. Heartstrings can be valuable with the right amount of pulling.

Technically it's 21.00000000 million, not just 21. This is significant because as BTC increases in volume, transactions can be conducted at the .00000001 level.

how does your tip from above actually get processed?

Ah okay thanks, so it doesn't even come down to yourself being safe, it's possible for the wallet service itself to be compromised

Thanks for explaining. I'm not too familiar with using command prompt, it's there a way to use the paper wallet by just scanning qr? I see on that site it generates both the qr code and the written key.

Hey, I have a question. I don't have any bitcoins yet, I'm just doing research at this point. I downloaded this app to have a look and I'm confused about how it is safe. There is no mention of private key anywhere, all I have is the public key. If I wanted to send someone btc, I would just scan their QR and type in the amount to send - so where does the private key come into play. 
Also I have the web version open and it has no mention of private key either.
