Just fooling around. Crypto peeps help each other so there you go: 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:40:29
Usually a good indicator for a bounce.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:21:12
Yes a positive bounce. No, because the price drops once the shorts open. but they have to close at some point and what happens when they close?
@_date: 2018-05-03 08:40:18
@_date: 2018-08-16 09:18:24
It's at least a better time than back in December :D
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:59:06
let them fuel! We need MOAAAAA!
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:56:29
Send 1 btc to 1HjFVpU65iycpWqDPUubz1Dxi4X1PZEyhk and I will reveal it to you. :P
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:10:19
Thx, that's all I wanted. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:46:59
Lol, had to read that twice.
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:11:23
Money can buy anything. Sad but true. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 08:40:33
Yep, me too. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:46:16
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:43:26
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:39:25
My mother called me at $5700 and said: "She wants to sell now", I replied: "Fuck off" - best bottom indicator ever!
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:29:26
It got deleted it seems. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:46:55
[T]( you go, guys! [
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:46:40
There you go, guys! [
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:24:45
Yep, both serve the same reason.
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:25:31
what's holding you back then?
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:58:36
But this would be less efficient. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:32:06
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:04:14
*facepalm* again - no its not it's about the heaviest objects in the universe in general and it meant to be as a joke! NOT ETH. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:43:41
!00% right!
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:44:12
Hi, we enquired with our shop system provider whether BTCPay can be integrated and we will try to make it happen.
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:44:59
What about Onecoin to rule them all!!!! :D
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:42:29
YUGE if true!
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:09:22
How about checking their website and enlight yourself!
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:21:01
Thx. We'll look into it!
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:37:49
Might be a possibility! :(
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:37:33
Seems so, working fine for me!
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:46:37
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:59:42
*Facepalm* - You are overthinking it maybe a little! Lol. I tagged it cause I posted it originally in the subreddit ethtrader! Jesus, this community!
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:51:57
Dunno why you don't get it, but typical crypto peeps stubbornness. As I already said it's about the news and not about Roger! 
3/ Also, the SEC doesn't have the power to extend the 240-day deadline. The statute absolutely prohibits any further delays.
By law, that means if the SEC fails to make a decision by the February 27 deadline, the ETF will be automatically approved.
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:13:03
What if I am already all-in? :P
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:09:17
Right, according to the common theory if google searches go up the price goes up and vice versa. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:06:06
Actually both. It is relevant now but also will become relevant in the future, if it fulfills its prophecy! However, it is just my bad for using the wrong word there. Should have said - "perhaps". Anyway, thx for the English lesson! :D
@_date: 2018-11-01 11:26:48
lol, did you even watch the video?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:01:23
Hi there, thanks for your comment. Do you know a good alternative? But seriously, now isn't the time to spend Bitcoin anyway, right?!?!?
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:10:36
Check the website for additional information!
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:26:56
Wow, you peeps must be butthurt. (no offense just saying) I personally don't like Roger too but he has done a lot of good things for this community as well. Anyway, that's not the point here. The point is that if the Govt shutdown continues the Bitcoin ETF could get auto approved and that'S a fact.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:44:48
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:37:21
Yep, it's inevitable!
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:07:56
There is no such thing as bad publicity.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:20:36
It's the first time I make a poll. If you guys like I can share my gathered infos with you afterward.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:30:04
Little does he know. Have fun win your new sofa. ;)
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:23:28
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:44:18
I'm sorry for ya mate. That really hurts.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:22:28
For me, moon will be at $1,000,000!
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:31:02
Gotcha fam!
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:05:46
But guys, pls don't spoil what usually happens next!
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:25:05
Or here: 
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:12:44
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:25:21
You mean something like this? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:16:15
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:58:48
I agree I see a bigger upside here than a downside especially if you take into account that shorts on BTC/USD hit a new ATH last Friday and we haven't even seen a proper short squeeze yet!
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:21:16
And how is this related to the advance of social media! It's more about the money that flows into crypto and this doesn't match in any way the dotcom bubble!
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:17:01
That'S unlikely if you compare it to historical data!
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:32:23
No, only for Bitfinex.
