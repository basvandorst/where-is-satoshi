Well technically...e-coin could actually be a broad umbrella term to cover the main types of digital coins...but I think E-Coin is probably Evil Corp's answer...which is a bit funny when you think about it.

Or support the dude who created AdBlock instead of a corporation and use his service and set up a monthly or one time donation.
Ah CatBlock :3

The second you mentioned it wasn't your account the reps red flag went up. There are things you can and cannot say to people that aren't on an account and you might lose points or get reprimanded if you break that. Working in that environment makes me not mad at reps just trying to earn a living but the institutions that are really profiting.

In all honesty, 
The main goal is to protect accounts. I don't work for PayPal but I used to work for a bank managing accounts and we always made notes if anyone other than account holder calls. It's really just a procedure for the security of the account. Also, money laundering is the reason I think they have to make those reports. I refuse to verify my SSN with PayPal because I don't think they need that information from me. I'd rather waits to withdraw if I go over my $500 limit than give them essentially my identity. 
Source: caught a bunch of fraud during my job so I understand why they would have done that.

I would contact your bank, but if you withdrawal the money so it can't be taken out then your bank will probably also charge you a returned item fee or something.
