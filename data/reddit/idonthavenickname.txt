33 is not the number ofc.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:42:04

@_date: 2019-07-15 20:49:22
I'm into btc for months now.. thank god I didn't went for coinbase. I use Bitstamp and have 0 problems.
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:05:37
3 btc sent. enjoy
@_date: 2019-11-24 09:01:57
Thanks for the advice, but I would never put any money into any shady website. I'm not greedy
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:15:31
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-04 17:59:19
Alright, thank you!

You don't need to report anything. Any person with common sense won't fall for any scam. Only retards lose money like this, it's natural selection.
@_date: 2019-11-24 10:49:44
I think you guys need to report yourselves for losing money that way.

Great info, thanks. I just got a new trezor and was testing everything, so I can wait weeks if needed. Will read about double-spend anyways. Ty
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:58:23
I checked now, already 3 confirmations.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:37:30
I see a lot of posts of people saying they hold the account for weeks before they can withdraw, does this happen with coinbase pro as well?
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:50:08
Awesome, all I needed. Thank you
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:52:03
I will not open this link
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:27:19
I don't have any advise for you, sorry. I just want to say that I genuinely laughed reading ur post.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:49:45
From what I read, 2fa and multisig are the same thing, right? I have standard wallet, can I upgrade to multisig or should I create new wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:06:37
Perfect, I got it with this docs.
Thank you for your help, much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:14:53
Thank you all for the explanations. Have a nice day
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:24:31
Very usefull, thank you! I did this, public key and balance matches the old wallet, but the Receive address is different. I suppose this is normal, since it's a new wallet.
What I need to do if I eventually need to move some coins? Create new wallet and restore seed phrase?
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:37:50
Seems like they are different things, I'll stay with 2fa. Thank you for the tip.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:29:36
Nice tip. I don't plan to move the coins for long time anyway, but it can happen if I need, we never know.
Thank you again man, I'm very grateful.

Very usefull answer, thank you. Let me ask you, I have some ppl who can send me btc. I downloaded electrum wallet, am I ready to receive btc? Also, do I need to make any changes at settings?
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:07:00
Thank you all for ur answers. Yea I'll wait for some drop and probably go with Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:28:51
Thank you, I'll read about fee bumping. Last question, if I want to sell btc the options are selling to friends or register in a store, like coinbase, right?
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:50:33
Roger that. Thank you so much for ur time.
