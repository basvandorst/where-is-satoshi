I like Dogecoin precisely because it "doesn't do anything". I mined a small amount about two weeks into its release and been moving them around here and there since. The price has stayed the same since 2013. That's great for a crypto - because it's not a shitcoin (fundamentals make sense and they're not trying to scam anybody), hashrate and volume is still high, but it doesn't have the same dev support and supply limitation that Bitcoin has. Doge will never be a HODL to increase your value coin, but if you're looking to park your cryptos into something stable that won't crash to zero, and can be moved around with low fees and relative ease, then it's a pretty good option. Network isn't clogged by kittens either.

I assume he meant in financial years (don't know if that begins in Jan or April in his jurisdiction). So cashing out 500k now in December will be taxed in FY 2017 while cashing out the next 500k in January will be taxed in FY 2018. Where I live the FY starts in April though.

You heard it here first guys. If you're part of the 21 million club, you can officially buy ANYTHING. Forget lambos, you can own every molecule ever created, reverse entropy, and cause the heat death of the universe!

I get scared storing 0.001 BTC on any online medium. But then again I'm a pure hodler.

Wow you must be pretty far down the rabbit hole to think this guy's woodworking skills is part of some sort of BTC/BCH conspiracy.

They are. You can choose to filter them out.

Not sure the demographic moving large amounts of Bitcoin in Asia would sleep through the fork announcement.

And then in another 4 years it'll rally from 4k to 40k... repeating the cycle all over again.

The miners are still incentivized to mine because of transaction fees - with no new coins they're getting 100% transaction fees from mining every block. So the mining will keep increasing the value of the coin (zero inflation btw) and the value of the coin will keep miners wanting to mine for the fees.

Didn't I read somewhere that brute forcing SHA 256 takes more energy than is available in a hypernova or something? I imagine if SHA-256 broke down, Bitcoin would be the last thing any of us would be worried about.
