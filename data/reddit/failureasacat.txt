I love the way $3,000 is not even that far away and we are talking 25-30k in the next 3-5 years now

Whats dank about this meme?
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:02:57
its called neighbor memory. You simply ask 1 in 20 bits to remember his neighbours, thus not needing to store them.
When you need to fetch the data, you ask the bit to recite his 19 mates to the right. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:47:24
Yeah youre right :) its really good actually
I certainly didnt have that much at that age
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:06:54

@_date: 2017-02-13 21:01:10
Ok I found out, you rar the tx's instead of zip, much smaller sizes
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:16:09

@_date: 2017-02-13 20:44:36

@_date: 2017-02-04 15:14:21

@_date: 2017-02-17 10:15:55

@_date: 2017-02-25 07:55:40

@_date: 2017-02-17 18:18:57

Bing translation
 Just kidding. reddit in brackets to no good name of new technology and white papers has announced two people have to capitalize on it, I tried to Tweet as a NetA. w
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:49:46

HODL FTW
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:40:50
this is why most people dont come here any more, just listen to yourself. Im sure youre nice enough person in real life but you come across quite arrogant.
honestly there is no need to be a dick about it, fact is you dont know me, my background or anything about me for that matter to write a statement based on such a small and meaningless comment.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:46:08
one man, one cpu is tantamount to the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:03:19
thats a lot of text for such a silly answer
From satoshis white paper [page 3, para 2] - 
Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:42:37
some want big blocks, some want to compress blocks. one man one vote. 
Roger is using his deep pockets to buy votes and thats why he isnt liked
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:50:02
obvs innit
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:51:23

As someone who has starred at bitcoin charts for 3 years solid, i have no idea what this is
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:45:47
thanks for the answer, this is kind of a problem really
it dilutes bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:26:33
Hes right, bitcoin is magic internet money. Take that statement and work backwards
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:37:27
How do you know so much about bitcoin/blockchain?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:45:21
Your idea is solid.
Using LBC will keep your bitcoin off the radar.
Think about investing 20% of the bitcoin into the alt coins, this is where the big money will be made, however is more risky.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:53:07
hence "Hypothetical scenario."
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:52:49
So are lying by endorsing bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:57:40
expect this guy to talk more shit about shit he knows shit-all about
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:55:18
OMG that's EXACTLY what Hillary would say!
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:17:30
Never heard schiff referred to as a scumbag before. chill out a little maybe
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:52:41
yeah if I had 1000 btc, there is no way id sell now. it will likely get 1-2x this year
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:26:29
Hes right, bitcoin is magic internet money. Take that statement and work backwards
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:29:11
There is a block reward regardless of transactions, I cant see any scenario any time soon where blocks arent stuffed full, especially with the rate of block growth...
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:16:56
He really is! "its vaporware", its not really is it?
There are 5 implementations running on testnet, a fix for mal is required so it cant go live yet but that hardly fits the description of vaporware.
Sounds like you learned this word and want to use it
EDIT: just checked your post history, wow you are a destructive and unkind person. you should send yourself to an eater address
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:44:09
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:01:26

@_date: 2016-12-17 08:17:14

@_date: 2016-12-17 09:12:33

Definitely not rich. I dont own a home, have a peice of shit car, I hold cash, cryptos, physical gold and silver and mining stocks. I probably have a net worth of $400k.
I decided not to buy a house, but instead invest, ive taken risky steps but have doubled my portfolio for 3 years in a row, aim is to get to $1m by the end of 2017.
I started with zero and a small credit card debt in jan 2014
