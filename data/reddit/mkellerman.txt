"a new optional address type that forces coins to undergo a public clearing phase before being available at the destination - before which it can be moved to fail-safe address if the owner changes their mind. You treat coins as reversible until + 6 confirms after the clearing phase to have the same behavior as we currently do only now you can detect and reverse fraud before its too late. I suspect this idea will be added to Bitcoin eventually as other people also think its a good idea."
This is a brilliant idea that I had not heard before. You might even want to make the number of confirms before clearance to be configurable, so that it could take longer to confirm e.g. 24 hours. Exchanges could adjust the number of confirmations needed to clear the transaction based on the size of the transaction.

Typically the bitcoin price in Japanese yen is higher than the USD price. Japan has strict banking rules, so only Japanese residents can open a Japanese bank account. Japanese exchanges only allow withdrawals to Japanese bank accounts. In other words, this is a great arbitrage opportunity for you. Definitely a good idea.

The other day, some Japanese people confirmed to me that btcbox is the most well known bitcoin exchange in Japan
Are there any other bitcoin exchanges in Japan apart from btcbox?

Tradingview.com allows you to plot charts of BTCUSD and LTCUSD for btc-e, also BTCUSD for bitstamp and mtgox. Just sign up for their free version. It's very good.

Thanks for these comments.
My further research has led me to believe that futures may be a better option than buying on margin, as you can have more leverage (if you need it) and you do not need to pay interest on your position.
The following exchanges allow trading in bitcoin futures:
**okcoin.com** -- very liquid and extremely low commission
**bitvc.com** -- owned by huobi.com, a bit less liquid than okcoin.com, their terms say that winners will get charged for any exchange losses
**icbit.se** -- unfortunately there is not enough liquidity on this exchange
**796.com** -- liquid, but if the bitcoin price moves more than 10% during the contract period, winners have to pay for the exchange losses, making things a bit unpredictable
**bitmex.com** -- a new exchange that has not yet opened its doors

Use Google Authenticator on two devices. When setting up 2FA for btc-e, scan the QR code to both devices. Both devices will then display the same 2FA code. If you lose one device or one device dies, set up the 2FA for btc-e on two devices once again.

I'm now feeling that the  initiative is better than savegox. It is being led by Olivier Janssens, alias AnarchyStar on IRC and Anarchy on bitcointalk. 
Basically, It makes more sense to liquidate the assets at Gox and start a brand new exchange that is 100% owned by the Gox creditors. The creditors would share in 100% of the projectgox profits, rather than just 50% as the savegox people are offering. 
The new exchange would be open source and transparent and if successful the creditors will get their money back, just as with the savegox plan.

**I think the typical cost of a wire transfer at most banks would be:**
* $25 to $35 for the sending party, regardless of amount of money
* 2% or so currency spread
* $10 to $15 for the receiving party.
* So the total cost would be around $60.
**Using OandA:**
* Wire the money to OandA's US dollar account with Royal Bank of Scotland London City Office: $25 to $35
* $10 to $15 paid by the receiving party (OandA)
* Convert to EUR with virtually zero spread.
* $15 OandA flat charge
* Withdraw from OandA to German bank with SEPA transfer (probably free of charge)
* Total $55 regardless of the amount transferred.
Another thing to bear in mind is the speed of Bitcoin transfers, especially if you have Bitcoin on hand.

Bruce, you said: There is no way some other dream team is going to assemble and do a months work in three days and save the day.
According to Daniel Kelman in the Google hangouts video, the deadline is not 3 days from now. If OkCoin are not yet ready with their plan, the court is likely to give them more time.
I'm personally a customer of OkCoin and find them good. It is seems that the terms that the OkCoin-backed plan wants to offer are better. Please watch the Google hangouts video--it is over an hour long, but well worth it. My view is that we DO have alternatives to Sunlot's plan.

If people trade inside MtGox but people can't withdraw or deposit, then the total btc plus fiat inside MtGox must remain unchanged. So I think this is a non-issue.

This is a great idea. Maybe some of the coins in the silk road coins seized by the Feds (about 154k coins?) cointain stolen gox coins. If so, maybe these could be returned to a fund that would compensate Gox account holders.
To the OP: you need to create a more confidential way to submit addresses.

You could definitely save money because the rate for buying bitcoins using Euros on many exchanges (btc-e, kraken) is about 5% better than for USD. The thing to do would be to open an account at btc-e.com or kraken.com, complete AML verification and then wire USD to this account. Then convert the USD to BTC on the exchange and then immediately convert the BTC to Euros. Then withdraw the Euros to your own Euro account in the destination country. 
P.S. It may be that these exchanges do not accept USD transfers from the US. You could open an offshore USD account, for instance in Jersey. You'd need to wire your USD to this account first (cost about $50).

The homepage at savegox.com does not give enough information for me to know if their proposal is a good one or not.
According to what I heard, the plan is to pay back 20% of assets to investors, or let them have a share in a resurrected MtGox and this did not seem a good deal to me. According to the homepage, their current thoughts are different--they plan to pay out all recovered assets to creditors pro rata and give them shares in the resurrected business. Anyway it needs more clarification.
According to the savegox homepage, letting the Japanese courts distribute the assets will be a horrible drawn out process.

It says that they have just received notice from 3rd party payment processors that they have received a notice from the central bank to stop deposits. Bter has always not accepted deposits directly from commercial banks and therefore they do not know what the central bank's policy regarding payments via commercial banks. As soon as they have further news, they will inform you via a notice and via Sina Weibo.

When you scan the 2FA QR code into Google Authenticator, do this on two devices so that if one device is lost, you still can use Google Authenticator on the other device.

I think labor costs in Nepal must be quite low, so are ATMs really needed? Couldn't shopkeepers provide a bitcoin exchange service. Are there shops that buy and sell gold there?

A similar situation used to exist in the UK with VAT on bitcoin. Representatives of bitcoin companies had discussions with the tax authorities and got this reversed in the UK. Something similar should happen in Australia. It is obvious the authorities are confused about what bitcoin is.

Yes, you can. The transaction won't show up as confirmed in bitcoin qt until it is synced though. You can use blockchain.info to monitor the number of confirmations.
Be careful if you have bitcoinQt on 2 or more computers and use the same wallet files on multiple computers. If you send bitcoins from one computer, and then send bitcoins on another computer, you may end up trying to spend the same bitcoins if bitcoinQt is not synced. In this case, your transaction will get ignored by the bitcoin network, as it was an attempt to double spend. The wallet file on the computer which sent the transaction that was ignored will then contain an incorrect bitcoin balance as bitcoinQt won't know that the transaction was ignored by the network. You'll have to copy the wallet file from a computer that has the correct balance.

OKPay are quite paranoid about AML and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at English, so their replies are often hard to understand. Their support are also slow. However in my experience they are an honest company.
I tried phoning OKPAY and got through to a rude and unhelpful Russian woman, so I wouldn't bother phoning them.
One thing you can do is contact user "OKPAY" at bitcointalk.org. He is a native speaker of English and can clarify what OKPAY support are saying and help get your issue prioritized.
