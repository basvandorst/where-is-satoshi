Not everything is about investment. Some people want cryptos to actually be common place in the modern world, so they support them.

Nope. Electricity costs out ways BTC production on those nowadays.

I always though there was more money to be made in Bitcoin investment then Dogecoin investment. Thus I would recommend playing with Bitcoin versus Dogecoin if you wanted to make a profit. I consider my Dogecoin purchases to be a loss as I find it fun to mess around with, but my Bitcoin  purchases are more serious. So naturally I have more of a stake in Bitcoins success than Dogecoin. But that is just my take on it.

On those little things? Of course not.

You buy Doge for the community not as an investment.

So... is that the selling point?

I would guess his name. That would explain why it is cut out.

Implying Bitcoin nerds won't just torrent everything. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:47:59
Yeah, considering I currently need to call the bank to reset my password this worries me.

 That community exists with the shared hatred of fat people. This one exists with the love of bitcoin. They are going against the grain here. They are probably trolls or kids taking economics 101.

Implying it's even a Christian holiday anymore.

The pepe crash has sure hit them hard, I agree.

It's about eating cheap chocolate and crying.

Unless you have been giving them an allowance that they now have to go without in order to pay off their debt.

Who said it wasn't? *Insert winky face*

Damn right. Well said my friend.
