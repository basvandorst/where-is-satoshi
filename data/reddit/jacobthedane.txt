BU people Gavin, Ver to a certain degree Falkvinge will rather destroy bitcoin than loose. They tried 2 times before with XT and classic which wouldnt have been so bad as they were just an increase in blocksize at a time where that was a valid argument. Now there is a excelent solution and they plow ahead with a totally different HF potentially activated at 51%. I guess if bitcoin cant survive it doesnt deserve to.

You could be right that all the miners are doing ATM is stalling any scalling initiative to drive up fees. When adding the Roger Ver bribe of  up to 8% the miners are making a killing. I hope that is what they are doing then there is no harm to bitcoin since they are aware of the dangers of BU activation without any real upside.

His argument is a valid as if I claim end user experience on my smartphone and then go on telling the experts how to design the upgrades. Being able to send bitcoins and having done that a lot gives you zero credibility on the technical side of the solution. As an end user it makes sence pointing to issues you would like to get fixed but not on the solution. Roger thinks he is literate in bitcoin technology but he is clearly not when debating an actual expert so this is amounts to negative knowlegde giving how hard he holds on to his own views.

You gotta be joking! Roger was shown to have very limited technical knowledge and with his selfconfidens the value of that knowledge is negative since he hold those wrong positions so long.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:27:59
You are right about the delay had nothing to do with the blocksize. There is however a connection to the fee since  the higher fees get transacted first and there is a higher amount of total fees when the wait is 1 and a half hour, Furthermore people were probably paying higher fee once it became clear that there was a massive line of high fee transaction waiting to be processed. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:59:31
Bitcoin is designed to make it in peoples economic self interest to make rational choises. Roger Ver is acting out his anger over some moderation  where he didnt get his will so he cares more about his ego than his money. I still hope bitcoin will be resilient enough to withstand this attack. Its time to stop giving Roger Ver and his BU friends a free pass when using emotional arguments in the scalling debate so now I am calling him out with the same retoric he has been using for over a year now.
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:25:10
He clearly dont have technical knowlegde when he is up against one that does. The only reason he could pretend to have that against Tone was that Tone isnt a technical person and therefor couldnt call out the claims Roger made.
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:54:47
he does it by paying miners and probably pools extra for mining BU.
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:44:05
But it also makes the driver experience more valuable than bitcoin user experience since it is so common and doesnt really require any skills. After 20 transactions I recond any resonably intelligent person will have figured 95% of it out so Rogers argument that one transaction pr week or even month isnt enough isnt valid in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:39:06

Too bad Roger got away with lying about his unconfirmed transaction that was based on a corrupt 0 fee transaction. It never confirmed so this wasnt a blocksize issue unless he will argue for infinite blocksize. This is definately not the only lie Roger told as other have pointed out. Roger shouldnt be debated without a huge suspision to what he says.

I see your point. I hope there is a way for them to see that f.ex. Seg Wit isnt bad for them at least not as I see it since if the usefullness of bitcoin increases the price will go up and also the blockchain transaction would get more valueáble with seg Wit to open and close LN channels meaning higher fees than today.

1) if it is frozen it is the gold and you could develope layers on top of it. This is the same as gold which is unchanges but gold as money changed over time. Controlled purity, coins,  paper, etc. 
2) As I understood it he meant frozen as no changes at all even updates implimented without SF or HF. I didnt get the impression Satoshi was especially against HF but these are the most dangerous with respect to chain splits.
3) The frozen view could be seen as an ideal solution but not one that can work in the real world if we like to make fast progress. If we get Segwit plus a HF to increase blocksize and future increases I actually think we want get more SF og HF but thats just my intuition.
4) Adam talked about a few ancesters to bitcoin. Hashcash, bitcoin, bitgold maybe a few more. I have heard this being used as an argument against Adam Back earlier but its natural that a person comming from a scientific community would reference his contributions in the progress. As far as I understand it Satoshis main contribution was putting all the previous knowledge together and introducing POW to make decentralisation possible. Doing that was an enormous feat but following in the scientific tradition he build on top of others. I dont believe Blockstream has very much control over bitcoin except having really skilled developers contributing to the protocol. Having many powercenters in the bitcoin governes model is a good thing as it makes change slow. What I see as the main risk of BU beside the technical is that it transfer more power to miners if show that they are indeed the ones making the decisions in bitcoin and not just one of several powercenters.

You are right but there are still 6 companies developing a LN version and I will argue that for them there isnt really any advantage for blockstream since Seg Wit is opensource so all had access to the code at the same time.

check out numbers of users of the different subreddits. Breaking away from the core protocol is a shift of continuity. If the BU people have good code submit it as proposal in the core protocol. The reality is the BU coders are not competent enough compared to the other developers in core and they cant handle that so they try to change the covernance model of different centers of power in bitcoin and just go with the miners.

I am not sure it is possible to have productive discussion in a 200 K+ user online community without hard moderation. The problem might be that rbitcoin in some peoples eyes are an authorative subreddit and not just a random internet forum. I find it hard in general to discuss online with people whose oppinion are far from my own so this complicates the discussion here when there are so different views present. Maybe even the original split in the developer space could have been awoided had all discussion been face to face. Anyway I like the developement the latest days in the debating tone.

I support a HF increase in blocksize after SEg Wit for political reason as it would get the community back together.

The large investment in hardware should make miners conservative about changes but actively promoting BTU is far from conservative. I think the change of PoW was only in case the BTU HF activates and the minority chain is 51% attacked.

The logical answer is CORE will rather have higher fee than centralisation. I am however sure that the members in CORE have varying opinions on the subject ranging from high fee is great to wanting a HF now however consencus in CORE is to get Seg Wit going and move small transactions to lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:40:38

I agree that we should give both sides what a little. The sad thing is the big block side gets 4 MB with seg wit and they are still not happy. If seg wit was introduced as a 4 MB HF with out discount for Seg Wit transactions they would be happy. The stupid argument Roger makes is that this is unfair to other transactions. Who in their right mind wouldnt make malliable transactions more expensive.

Fair enough. I also supports Seg Wit + 2MB HF for political reasons. After the last couples of weeks statements from Jihan and the publication of the BTU federation Im not sure this is what the debate is all about but rather a smokescreen for the coup attemt on bitcoin. It makes a lot of sence for Jihan to try to hijack bitcoin as it would be very profitable to have the control. I hope he now realise the power structure of bitcoin isnt as simple as he imagined and goes back to making equipment and running his mining operation. I actually think he could make a lot more if he split his company into a mining operation and a manufacture and didnt discount the equipment  to his own pool or partners.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:17:32
You are right we should all believe that bitcoin can go to zero and be willing to take that risk no matter how much one have in bitcoin.

A war with contentious HF to BU or a UASF.

We need to get Seg Wit activated then secondlayer solutions like lightning will make small instant and practically free transactions for coffee, pizza etc will be possible. I just looked back and it was a 1mBTC fee so just above one $ but too high for paying pizza. The blockchain just isnt very well suited for small payments especially due to confirmation time. I bought bruch a few weeks back and the fee was 0.2 $ for a 20 $ bill. This was still lower than the 2.5% the merchant would have had to pay VISA had I used credit card. watch Andreas' speach on lightning network. When this activates it will be the fullfilment of the narrative of bitcoin being able to do micro payments.

I hope you are right but it actually makes more sence if BTU is controlled by Jihan as he is the one standing to gain if the power is transfered to the miner solely. If the BU HF is successfull there is only one center of power in bitcoin and that is the miners especially the largest miner.

As I remembered it a year and a half ago it was XT and classic complaining about miners blocking progress and no somehow miners are all BTU have going for them. It would ofcourse in the current situation be nice to hav communication between miners and developers but I dont like if the two got too close. Ideally developers responds to request from the community as a whole and miners only accept solutions with consensus through out the community. One could argue this is what happens today with no activation of either seg wit or BTU. Its a shame with Seg Wit as I actually believe it would mive bitcoin to a place where the cool and interesting thing were going on everywhere else than in core developement and miners.

In the podcast with Adam Back posted yesterday he said that Satoshi actually voiced that opinion at some point that the protocol should be frozen and changes should happen on top of that. There was however too many bugs that needed fixing for that to happen. This isnt to hold out citations from Satoshi as authoratory but it makes a lot of sence if that was the case since everybody would know the protocol and make applications on top of that without anybody having an advantage.

You are right there is a place for all participant in bitcoins who want bitcoin to succeed as decentralised money and payment network.
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:52:16
As you say the BTU federation has been and still is throwing resources into advancing BTU and therefore they are getting weaker! I the strength of BTU will peak soon if that hasnt allready happened. The BTU opposition on the other side is growing every day so if we can get enough miner support to prevent a HF, the cost of continuing BTU support will be too high. When there is no price of capturing bitcoin which would be enormously profitable BTU will die and then Seg Wit can be activated. Also when core continues releasing updates BTU gets even more behind.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:26:19
It would be nice! also a list of people promoting BTU!

@_date: 2017-03-15 21:13:32
Roger, Falkvinge, Jihan Wu actually makes sence now. They are not just being irrational crybabys. Its more profitable to be in charge of a centralized bitcoin than just participate in a decentralized bitcoin. We should stop focussing on getting them to realize they are not thinking strait and focus on getting all other who believes them out of the delusion that BTU want the best for bitcoin. They dont.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:28:21
This and the BTU approach to developement should be repeated over and over when talking to people in doubt. I unfortunatly think BTU central persons, Ver, Jihan, Falkvinge, etc are not within reason and we should focus on the fringe BTU support and quality code is an essential factor of the current bitcoin protocol devepoled and maintained by core.
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:01:48
This represent the CORE vs. BU approch. Tested vs. reckless software. its not appeal to majority but consensus. Consensus is how science work, make work that obtain consensus among qualified persons in the field and this is what the CORE protocol does.

It varies a lot how much it is pr. KB. The big supprises are when there are multiple adresses being sent. I had one transaction that cleaned up my with 20 adresses that was around 3$. I generally just rely on the wallet. The "priority fee" is tricky sometimes in the past showing a 5 times the "normal fee", but it seems to be better the last transactions I made. If you want to learn more check the bitcoin fee distribution before sending. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:15:02

The only place I hear support for BU is in r/btc and from Roger and his paid crowd. No matter how you look at at it CORE developers have the best and most developerers in the cryptospace. Allmost all non Roger companies supports Seg Wit. Even Gavin Andresen supports the activation of Seg Wit first. Most youtube channels favor Seg Wit. S
o its very much the majority. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:11:05
you are right it was only mentally burying I was thinking but you are right and its probably a bad thing with a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:38:01
You are right. When second layer solutions are implemented no one would object to fees of several dollars to open and close payments channels or large on chain transfers.
@_date: 2017-01-01 12:41:53
If you believe in bitcoin do it and bury the bitcoins in a hardware wallet. Then forget about bitcoin and focus on getting your life going AKA getting a real job and your own place to live. Focus on your cost even when moving out and having found a job. In a few year you can have your saving in non bitcoin assets rebuild and if as we all hope bitcoin has taking off you will have that as well.  
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:03:15
He is right that bitcoin is too slow for payment in the shop but of course wrong about the blocksize will solve that. The reporter should have asked what he ment and then explained that LN solves the confirmation time problem for small payments.
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:44:17
Hopefully the crash can be postponed long enough to have BitCoin as a viable alternative. If lightning network lives up to its promises and gets small transactions away from the Blockchain (Ive heard the number 90%). SegWit and 2 MB blocksize should allow for app. 600.000 new lightning payment channels a day. If half of these are for new users we could add around 100 Mill new BitCoin users pr. year. Custodial acces could increase this even further so if we are lucky Fiat disappearing will be as beg a problem as if the postal service disappeared today. Offcourse a lot of people would loose money but it wouldnt be a disaster.
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:23:03
I have been using Bitwala debitcard for a month now for a majority of my creditcard purchases. Its a way of getting comfortable with the possibility of going total BitCoin at some point. Of course as you say there is cost at the moment doing it app. 3.5 for me since I am buying the Bitcoin at par. The advantage is that I only need to keep 200 EUR in fiat and can keep the rest in BTC. This has of course been a good month to start (I purchased 70% worth of BTC of my salary) but so far the difference in purchase price and the price I have been depositing BitCoin (600 EUR so far) I am up 25 EUR with the 3.5% cost. The main reason is to support the Bitcoin eco system and be able to tell people that bitcoin is money as I am spending it daily.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:36:05
Lets hope the scale starts to tip to the only reasonable choice at the moment. There is definitely a risk but the upside justifies this.

Falkvinge has been against Seg Wit for a long time. This post shouldnt be seen as a neutral observed of what was going on at the meeting but as a partisan contribution. Maybe he is right that Seq Wit isnt going to activates but he is delusional to think a HF of BU will, Its been out more than a year and has 17% hash power bought by Roger Ver.

Dont the forget the roger Ver bride til miners and probably pools. New pools probably like til ekstra money but the older and larger knows that BU activation would be poison for the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-01-18 06:54:52
I dont think that is the reason. bitcoin is also too small for Berkshire to invest in to make sence even a 100 M$ investment would make the price go ballistic so he is a too big player for the bitcoin marked. And clearly he doesnt understand bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-01-19 09:53:29
Roger promised a premium up to 8% to miners in his own pool and There is no reason to believe the pools that have joined BU isnt getting the same premium. At the current support of 15% this is about 22 blocks or a total of 275 BTC pr day in average of mining reward. 8% of that is 22 BTC pr. day. Giving that roger is assumed to have between 100 and 300.000 BTC he can continue this for a really long time. The good thing is that rising transaction fee means that Rogers costs go up in BTC value and at the same time hurts his businesses so maybe he will come to his senses.

I dont think the miners want this role. It was the crowd og Ver, Hearn, etc. that tried to by pass the community and get first Xt, then classic and now BS (sorry BU) activated through the miners. Hope the miners get started soon to do the right thing. I have a small hope that they wait until the community is so fed up with Roger Ver and company that there will be a general approval when we move forward with Seg Wit. The good thing is that every week with stalemate Roger Ver is loosing money to bribe miners to mine BU and even more of his earlier credit in the community.

Since you as you say isnt a coder I suggest you listen to the brightest coder in the cryptoworld aka core. If they didnt come up with anything simple its probably because that solution doesnt exist. Its like asking why the GUT theory is so complicated without knowing physics at all. If you were in good faith I take my sarchasme back, but you should really learn a little bit before thinking you are somehow more knowledgable than the experts, especially when the experts have just released a great update to the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:38:51
Most people here my self included believe Bitcoin still has a long way to go before the price stoppes rising, but as other points out dont invest more than you feel ok loosing. Start with a small amount.

Segwit will allow for LN and then the fee pr. transaction can easily go to several $ because it is used rarely and therefore it doesnt matter.

At the recent transaction glut combined fee from a full block ran slightly above 1 BTC. So they lost around 0.25 BTC every block they mined. Its about 2% less income. Even with the current level its 0.t BTC they loose or 0.8%. I think they will solve this when they get their operation going or they will be out competed once the Indian marked gets normal.

Looking at the technical trend ETH is going down in value relative to bitcoin since beginning of october and ATM there doesnt seem to be a change in that patern. It is still possible it will happen but right now I would sell and wait to buy back when the price bottoms out.  
@_date: 2016-12-06 19:47:16
Why dont you submit your proposal on github with some initial code to back up your plan. If it is a briliant solution I am sure everybody will say "we never thought of that" and scrap Seg Wit. If it isnt that brilliant it want. Reddit isnt the platform you are looking fore since its not mainly technical persons here. If by any chance you are just relaying misinformation about Seg Wit just go the the other subreddit who loves that.
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:10:40
Metcalfe´s law probably apply to Bitcoin since it is a network it is reasonable to assume the utility of Bitcoin increases by n squared. This is an even bigger problem for Roger Ver and the big block gang since for the userbase to double the transition on the network will increase by 4. It off course only gets even worse with higher multiples of users. This makes off chain scaling even more needed as the need for on chain scalability only grows linear with the users if it is assumed on chain is mainly for opening and closing channels.
 
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:11:02

ATM 29% of miners signalling Seg Wit. 87% is running Core software so they are not on the side of unlimited, Classic or XT. Core developers wants Seg Wit and by all accounts they are the most skilled and experienced in the field and outnumber in size the BU developers. Most wallet providers are onboard so yes its a majority that is against Seg Wit. The only reason why it matters is the 95% activation threshold otherwise BU wouldnt get any attention at all.

You realise who gets the new printed money first. Its not the middle class or underclass but wallstreet.

It clearly shows that the extra space created by a blocksize increase would evaporate in no time when the fee went down. There is a dire need for the off chain solution provided på Seg Wit.

Its like email. The 1000th has 999 other people to communicate with. The 100 only has 99. so the potential communication to the 1000th can be expected to be 10 times larger than the 100th eventhough only one extra has been added in both cases.

I not sure this is a problem. It makes users choose wallets that have good fee estimates and makes replaceby fee more urgent to implement. If ASICS boost need transaction fee ordering it gives miners using ASICS bootst less competitive  advantage such leveling the playing field. If Jihan further is funding the spam attack it is even better as it drain hes funds. Go spam attack and drain your money.

@_date: 2017-04-03 21:08:05
I dont know about never its good to have as a threat and therefore you should keep the option on the table but be very carefull about using it. But as I said Ill rather have status quo for a year than do the UASF and increase the anger in the community. When it becomes clear for the small group of people backing BTU financially that it isnt gonna pass I think we can get Seg Wit activated soon after that happens.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:49:03
Too bad!
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:31:09
I agree that we shouldnt fork prematurely with a UASF. Its better to wait half or even a year to get higher consensus eventhough bitcoins developement is stalling! If the political compromise needed is 2MB plus Seg Wit so be it. The big blockers however need to know that this an effecitve 4 MB block right away and up to 8 MB with Schnoor signatures and other improvements later.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:04:35

The good news is Wang Chun repeat support for LTC Seg Wit and base his objection against Seg Wit on the basis he dont believe in it technically. When Seg Wit activates on LTC and runs smoothly for a month or two he might reconsider his position for BTC.

He might be right that Roger was unaware of the ASICS boost, but he hasnt said anything about it after the news. He keeps tweeting BS about buying coffee and high TX fee. If Roger doesnt say anything on ASICS boost I will say it is more likely than not that he knew about it.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:32:03
Good idea with the explanation. If this is the case that Seg Wit blocks and regular blocks can co exist couldnt seg wit just activate with the miners who wanted to mine Seg Wit and the other continue the old mining?

I just think core have been very busy with getting segwit out and doing a hard fork before would draw attention away from that.

I would like to use bitcoin for payments but the blockchain is just really bad for that. we need a second layer instant payment system like lightning network and third party like circle for that.

If one wants to give aid to developing countries I think this is more effective than most other programs.

This is a low cost solution I have thought of. Any comments to the safety of it. Get a regular smartphone wallet Mycilium, blockchain.info, etc. Write down the passphrase and store it securely. Generate the adresses you need. Delete the wallet and use the adresses to hodl bitcoin. It seems as safe as paperwallets to me.

I dont know if this could solve it but its a stepping stone. If you made the payment in 3 -2 multisig and giving one to youself, one to your vendor and one to the supplier. If the supplier doesnt deliver you and your vendor can pull the bitcoin. when the supplies are diliveres to your vendor they will process the payment to the supplier. when you get your goods if the supplier hasnt gotten the bitcoin you can release it together with the supplier. Only way is if two out of three are cheating. Its not perfect but better than upfront payment for you and better than payment on delivery for the vendor. If the supplier has to pay someone down the road things of course gets messier. Anyway good luck this is the way forward for BitCoin.

The account is in bitcoin but its deposited on Circle pays address so you trust Circle Pay with your bitcoins. But for small amount like  paying for coffee etc its fine. I keep between 50 and 200 usd and use it to keep track of money back and forth to my children.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:22:21
I believe you are wrong about the time a 10 MB blocksize with a significantly lower transaction fee would buy. Once the transaction fee is virtually back to zero transactions will explode. I think we are talking months rather than years. Since first half of 2015 we have seen a 10 fold increase in transaction fee and a 2-3 times increase in transactions so the demand for transactions are massive ATM.

I dont really get this made up argument. Bitcoin coding isnt simple before or afte segwit. Segwit is about 3300 code lines total code lines in bitcoin is 74000. Not everything can be made simple. If we dont get segwit which enables of chain scaling bitcoin is never going to become a currency for everyday transaction. Its a bold and probably defining move for bitcoin and I hope it works out fine, but I have no reason to believe otherwise.

Automisation  will take over at some point but that point is pushed further out the lower the wage is. Now there is a great incentive to automise at a level where people is willing to work at a rate that is cheaper than the automation but since that is forbidden they will loose their job. Goverments always screw things up.

Healthcare  is screwed up becourse of goverment involvement and regulation. If it was a free marked it would cost next to nothing between 5 and 60 year for healthy people. I am sure the sick would get treatment close to or better than today for everyone in this age group and the old would probably get almost the same and with greater satisfaction as today most is wasted on croniq deseases that could be cured with healthy lifestyle at a much lower cost. Ask anyone in China if their childrens life are better or worse than their own at the same age and Im pretty sure 90% or more wouæd answer that it is better. 
The first industry to automise completely is chauffeurs and its definitely bad for them however the cost for the average american family is expected to drop around 5000 $ pr. just by automising cars as today and will drop even further when accidens disapears and cars can be made much lighter and cheaper. The cost of personel accidents are not included in this number.

ASI is definitily a danger to the human race but UBI will do nothing to better or worse that. Unless the ASI wants resources for it self there isnt a problem since when everything is automated all will be virtually free except for the small human labor and resources owned by humans.

Not sure actually do it. I found out after not having checked a while. I sent 0.1 btc to check it out and was supprised the USD value was only that of 0.08 BTC. If you set the setting to BTC it stores it in BTC however its not easy to use then as you will have to calculate the amount you want to send if your local coffee shop like to accept bitcoin using ABRA. I would like to see it have the option of keeping value in BTC but users being able to see the corresponding value in USD or what ever currence one favored.
