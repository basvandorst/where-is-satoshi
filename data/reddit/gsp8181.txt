They are required to do that to the magistrate only including what indictable (felony) offence has been committed, what they are looking for, why they believe it is on the premises, how it related to the investigation and that it is not legally protected (they can't bust in and seize communications from your lawyer about your case). The magistrate will then issue the warrant independent of that
It needs to contain
* Court Code, Court office address and Telephone number
* What law the warrant was issued under i.e. S.8 PACE 1984
* What they are looking for i.e. documentation relating to the purchase and supply of controlled substances, electronic storage devices and high value items such as (but not limited to) Jewellery, Designer Goods
* Premises authorised to be searched i.e. 10 Downing Street London SW1A 2AA including any outbuilding, associated vehicles and persons found on the premesis
* Number of occasions on which search is authorised i.e. Once
* Person(s) authorised to execute this warrant: i.e. Any constable
* Person(s) authorised to accompany those executing this warrant: i.e. Any officer of the Metropolitain Police including crime scene investigators
* Who applied for the warrant i.e. PC 1234 John Smith, Paddington Police Station
* How long the warrant is valid i.e. 1 month from date of issue
* Signature
There is generally free reign whatever items are listed it as long as it can be related to what they are investigating and is not overly broad. In this case putting Mobile phones, laptops, computers is a lot easier to justify than Electronic articles used in the commission of the offence of whatever, because they then have to try and prove that that specific computer was used for that offence before taking it, rather than just take everything electronic. Chances are all electronic items could relate to the case. The catch all law of PACE s8 and s15-16 has basically outstripped the warrant process and yes it is possible for them to search a premises without telling you why, just what they are looking for, previously it would have been pretty clear i.e. under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
If you are then arrested they will have to tell you what you are arrested for

S15-16 PACE warrants are usually used afaik for tax evasion as it allows for investigation under a specified power which is a catch all for tax offences. edit: this isn't their only purpose it issued under specified legislation that allows a search warrant to be issued. 
S8 PACE warrants are used for specified indictable offences so i'd guess where a crime has been committed and BTC was involved
Please someone correct me if i'm wrong though

In the UK transactions are flagged under money laundering regs over €10,000. Cash can be seized in excess of £1,000 pending investigation. Terrorism also has some reporting procedure that is secret to the security services and the Met Police
