Yup, if you ever don't want jury duty you can go two routes, talking to your peers and the attorneys about nullification, or talking to your peers and the attorneys about "niggers." 
Both "n" words are your ticket to freedom.

My mom set hers up just fine, and she's the type of lady that has an android phone but no Google account attached to it. [It's literally this, and you're done.](

Horrible analogy. Routers and modems are extremely accessible and inexpensive technology that literally anyone with the ability to twist in a cable jack can install. And once you do, it's yours for life, no rent or service charges.

A hardline connection as pictured doesn't require a password, just plug it in, call to start the service if you haven't already, and you're done.

What I don't understand with your granny test is whether or not you're arguing that setting up a bitcoin node is more accessible than plugging a modem in. The entire argument here is whether or not having the tech savvy to understand how to set up a modem is a requisite for getting into bitcoin.

No, I'm not a technical genius, but I bought and set up my own modem/router box. It's pretty rudimentary stuff and good advice with how much your ISP charges for rent on the box and the potential for fraudulent "lost equipment" fees. 
It appears as though some AT&amp;T customers don't have the choice to use their own box, but anyone else into btc using an ISP provided box seems odd.
