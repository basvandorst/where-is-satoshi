difference of opinion, I guess. Just voicing mine that calling peoples hard work to find a solution "crap" is not very legitimate to me. So it's not that it was negative about bitcoin that I though wasn't constructive, but it's lack of substance or contribution to the exchange of ideas.
As far as what am I trying to hide, not sure what you even mean by that. Is it just "the implication" that's supposed to carry the weight of your argument?

I don't think it's a matter of telling people what to believe, but simply suggesting that one not be an ignorant tool of those that would manipulate via divisive language. That would include all kinds of angry mobs, left or right wing, imho. I obviously don't speak for anyone but myself.

I appreciate your thoughtful response and can agree with it a bit. My main gripe with the comment was that it was insulting the hard work of others bringing about this technology and not really offering anything constructive, in my opinion.
I'm not trying to recruit people to the idea of bitcoin, just calling out someone who I felt was being unfair to the developers working hard to find solutions.

That's a great example of the type of polarizing comments that can erode at the Bitcoin community.
No real information, broad overstatement that would get the attention of people working hard on a solution, explicitly targeting the entire community as being fixated, etc.
Well crafted example of some intentionally devisive retoric of which Andreas is speaking of.

But saying it's crap, and it'll never work is a bit overstated, wouldn't you agree? Imho, that kind of language is the problem. Now, had he followed up with some evidence, besides anecdotal accounts, then it might be a useful critique. Then it would have moved into a space of debating the idea vs insulting a community that you don't agree with.

Well, your social score will be safe with an attitude like that. Good job citizen, you have access to transportation this month.

Perhaps. I'm just concerned with the turn key tyranny. And the best indicator of wether someone will be a good moral actor is their past behavior. So this seems like a move contrary to the values of what brought about crypto in the first place: individual freedom and autonomy.
These people enabled regimes like Saudi Arabia to persecute dissidents.
If you take a step back and consider the global landscape in terms of governments, and historically, a free democracy is the exception, not the norm.
So as far as affecting how coin base operates, you're right, there is no evidence, but then again, who would expect them to broadcast their citizen surveillance apis, should they be implemented.

Transaction fees for all the transactions in the block they mine AND their investment in hardware/infrastructure plus any Bitcoin they have would also drop in value if allot of miners abandon the network, so there is built in incentive even after all coins are mined.
Also, Google tells me that the estimate for when all coins will be mined is 2140 due to increasing difficulty to mine a block over time.

November 17th, at 2:31pm... Oh wait... There is no way of anyone knowing if it will crash or climb indefinitely, so it really is a moot point.
I wish when people speak of bubbles, they would add some kind of rationality, or attempt to present an actual idea vs that it happened in the past so it's going to happen again. Low effort fear mongering in my opinion.
I could say that about anything. You just started dating, have you? Get psychologically prepared for when it goes to shit, cause it will... Pointless commentary in my opinion.
Truth is no one knows.

Pulled out of context. That quote was literally saying how that pesimistic mentality could get out of hand.
But I get it, you trolling me now, digging through my post history, pulling things I say out of context to get to me because you disagree with my opinion.
I wish you luck with the internet/life. There are allot of opinions you may not agree with our there and if you let them get to you this much, you'll be upset most of the time.

I think the original name, Bitcoin, works just fine. Rename the fork. Using your analogy, it's like he says his currency is the dollar, and qualifies all the other ones, like Canadian dollar or American dollar. Makes his seem like the original.

This might be valid if he didn't then try to rebrand Bitcoin as Bitcoin core.

One is the original, the other a copy.
