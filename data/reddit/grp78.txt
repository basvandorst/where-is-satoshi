do you realize that all exchanges are interlinked by arbitrage right?
Bitfinex pumps Bitcoin price on its site and other exchanges price will follow suit because people will take advantage of price difference between exchanges, ultimately, prices across all exchanges will tend to coalesce around the same average and given that Bitfinex is one of the major BTC exchange, it is pretty easy to move market around the world

you are naive if you think Bitcoin protocol isn't subjected to the opinions or influence of special interest.
as long as human exists, there will always be special interests and opinions
the Bitcoin protocol is invented by human, therefore, it will never be free from human interests and opinions
Crypto enthusiasts like to trash the banking system for corruption and whatnot,  but they completely fail to comprehend that as long as human is involved, these phenomenon will not go away, Crypto and banking are both invented by human, and as such will inherit the same human flaws in one way or another.

" but doesn't require any trust up-front "
I hate it when people keep saying Bitcoin is trust-less. It is fucking not. 
Unless you understand the code, which I don't and millions of other Bitcoin users don't, then you have to trust in the code that the developers put out. And you also have to trust the miners in China to stay honest, and trust the wallet that you use (same issue with the Bitcoin code) to not steal your coins. 
Bitcoin is not trust-less, it just shifts the trust from one part to another part.
