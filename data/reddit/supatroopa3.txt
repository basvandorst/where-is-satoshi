Comments rip through Doug too. Everyone loved him until this. He's said stuff I don't either but he got a negative feed back it looks like.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:52:57
How was it FUD? From what I saw it was people trying to see if this new thing in the space was going to affect BTC in the future. It might still as well if they become more popular, who knows.
Volume is still low though so no movement up either.

Check out The Billion Coin, the testimonies are terrifying. Promising 1-3% daily return. Boomers and Africans are promoting it a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:20:17
I have a stuck tx at 3 sats a byte from months and months ago. Will it finally get pushed maybe now?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:22:53
It could be people just aren't used to the volatility yet, you really test emotions in crypto, whether gaining or losing.

@_date: 2018-01-13 15:45:12
What exactly is the price now?
I'm getting 10k on Blockfolio and Delta and still 14.5k on Coin Market Cap. Is it a dip with a delay to CMC?

I've been waiting for RH in Canada for years.

Second day in crypto was the cashening, trial by fire I guess but rewarded nicely for not selling in the run up to 20k.
Not that I knew how to sell it quickly anyway, with the unconfirmed txs I figured I was stuck anyway so might as well hold it for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:02:37
I do so, lol.
He's basically says hold though, he promotes Blockchain with migrants and doesn't even say the bubble will pop but stabilize.
Hold is Soros approved unfortunately
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:16:20
He probably already bought ages ago
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:07:00
Delta too but they both pull from Kraken which had a big shutdown last night. It's adjusted now to that price. Nearly shit a brick because I coupdn't find it anywhere else.

"Futures have no effect"
"Futures have an effect"
The setiment I'm getting from this sub. Holding anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:15:51
Yeah I think that was happening, I would check and anytime I opened Mycelium it was say "Rebroadcasting", was driving me crazy, thought it would be stuck forever.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:21:33
Why not take 25% of gains and just put in your favorite alt while you wait?
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:49:20
I had a 3 sat/byte tx get confirmed from when I was an idiot in early Dec.
Was too nervous to try cpfp by myself and it wouldn't build the transaction from mycelium. Pushed through randomly on the 21st this month. What a relief.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:31:35
It is suspiciously back to around the same price before the futures came out as if it would've maintained a steady rate up to 12/13k without the futures and the momentum from the cashenning.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:11:54
Comments like have already raised suspicion on you
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:22:52
That's what I thought I had with Electrum. Other people seemed to be using it fine.
Will be trying armory instead. Seems similar
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:34:43
Can you expand on that? Like use a US bank or something?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:42:57
Okay next question, or a couple.
How does a cold wallet add new blocks/chains when transactions are made if it is not connected to anything?
Could I run multiple of the same wallet? Or must I use different programs for each wallet I put coins in?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:57:59
Okay, that clears a lot up. Thanks
The verification on QuardrigaCX still makes me a little nervous sending so much information over a PC. How is the Equifax verification?
I found out I have a coinsquare from a while ago. Is it fine to use that? What really makes QCX so much better?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:12:10
Okay, that's not so bad. This can't jump you up a tax bracket at all. It remains within my actual income level?
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:50:43
This is kind of what I was thinking. Regardless of the currency you still get the same returns for BTC fluctuations since you can buy in fractions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:38:30
I don't know if it's covered there but something that details how to get out quickly for whatever reason could be added too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:41:20
Remember in Braveheart how that one prince totally abandoned them and then Wallace was sliced open on a alter while the rest of his men died in a subsequent battle?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:15:23
No, in general, what is the fastest way to cash out in general and what should I do? Inform CRA? Use coinsquare and get it sent to my credit card or something?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:54:26
From the website
Here's a screenshot
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:46:52
How can I do that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:20:32
So let's say I don't have any of those accounts and just have it on a wallet, used an ATM to get it originally
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:36:14
Just offshoot questions I had. I must have missed them. Went through Getting Started and FAQ.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:20:46
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:07:46
So, how do you cash out?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:20
So you send it to an exchange like QuadrigaCX or Coin square and I can transfer it to a bank from there?
Will I need to alert the CRA if I do this? Will it be counted as income?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:07:17
Can you trade other cryptos on it? Just looks like BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DOGE and DASH
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:10:45
I guess you can't avoid it really, I just wanted to keep identity away from my crypto as much as possible. Nothing else I've ever done needed this before. It's not so much the exchange I don't trust, it's sending the information out in general. 
I don't need the business verification do I? 
Is there anything I can/should black out on any of the statements? Using DL, ID and utility, these I am most comfortable with.
This all means I guess I have to be very honest with gains (assuming there are any) to the CRA. I think I asked somewhere else but you can you link a TFSA to this at all?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:40:58
Well I don't want to do that.
What is similar to Electrum? I'm just looking for something with security I can put on a drive that I can encrypt
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:23:59
Was nervous with the amount of verification online.
Are there just alts that aren't available to Canadians?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:41:44
Okay, can I use fiat to buy those coins or must I use BTC?
Let's say I use Shapeshift and buy some random alt not on a Canadian exchange. Where now do I put that random alt? Are Shapeshift or Changelly exchanges in themselves where I can keep alts or will I need another wallet for those?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:18:34
I originally bought from ATMs, 8-10% hit right away, plus sec cams and others around, carrying cash etc etc, not the best way looking back.
Localbitcoins has similar problems, meeting a stranger with a wad of cash. It works like an auction so they sell their coins higher than market and their price reflects the price of a coin at the time of transaction, not when the sale/date/time was decided.
Anyways, thank you a lot for you help.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:54:05
So it basically updates when connected and I could use the keys in a different wallet anytime I please?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:51
What do you guys consider bad news?
Like would you ride BTC into the ground?
Serious question, where is your personal "It's game over" line?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:07:04
I just don't want to keep any coins on my phone at all so I wanted a desktop wallet.
I just seemed really strange that nothing even came up for the service agreement.
I had already set up a standard wallet with Electrum and this was going to be a TFA secured one.
I also tried the multi-sig one but wasn't able to link it another wallet. I tried to use the Mycellium keys for the second signature but it didn't accept it. Should I try another desktop wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:46:25
Same position, literally have to set up another bank account to buy online. Planning to just buy 500 I think and then see what happens.
I still have to wait until end of day though unless I go to an atm
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:51:09
But alts must be purchased/sold with existing BTC?
Can I use a TFSA for all of this to avoid taxes on gains?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:42:38
How much of a gain? Any amount? I'm not sure if your Canadian but if you are can I get that into a TFSA?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:29:14
Literally went there from the choose your wallet section in the guide
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:46:23
I know, I get the whole hold thing. But for whatever reason if I need to get out I wanted to know.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:41:40
Would that just be to take advantage of US exchanges? Or are you trying to get USD?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:37:59
Bra, complacency
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:51:18
LET OG
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:51:26
Can a blockchain not just be made independently? Like the way a company can just make a website on it's own? One thing that always confuses me about crypto is why a company can't just invest to build a blockchain that suits them and their business style, why does it even need to be a currency?
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:43:45
"What happened to the warriors at Thermopylae?"
   "Dead to last man"
"haha, wait wat?"
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:29:25
Yeah that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:52:55
No FUD we are still not in full bullish trend, this week will likely see a break either, I'm holding my money to see what happens. We likely also have to test the low.
Bullish overall, the lower it goes really the better, more opportunity for new/existing buyers. We don't have the volume now but we did get a huge spike at 6k, the momentum we could get from a lower low in my opinion is preferred. Good luck stay safe.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:22:07
But it's still silly to own a whole btc just so you have one. Amd even still it should be a currency, you'll be spending it day to day one day so you might enter milibit territory anyway. The better stat is just owning btc or any coin in the top 5 MC at the very least putting you still in a small oercentage of people
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:38:36
Depending on who you follow and your TA that could be now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:27:17
He's pretty transparent, he posted his portfolio before and he even addressed he doen't intend to shill his coins. Literally every Youtuber is doing this, "this isn't financial advice but here's what's happening and what might be a good move". I get what you are saying but people really should be able to discern this themselves, that everyone has some agenda to some extent. He bought a new dog, does that mean his subs will buy dogs too?
Anyway you should be careful what you say man, there's some dangerous people in crypto. Just looking out for you.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:29:16


Why not?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:40:40
Joke from Dougs video when BCC Youtubers told him to watch out.
Considering the criticism on his vids I assumed you guys had watched the majority.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:42:59
Idealy yes, no volatility but I saw this as a way help the adoption process giving incentive to customers and store owners. If I had any kind of shop I'd give it a try
Yeah too many words
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:17:00
Who says it needs to be a transaction? Why not just information like messaging/emailing secure documents for use just within a government office? It doesn't need a market cap or anything then right? Or imagine if governments just had to put their budgets on a blockchain so they can be reviewed? Sure, maybe they need to make a token but it doesn't mean we get to buy and hold government coin. My point is I think blockchain can be used without us (no fud)
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:18:35
We'll see, I shorted a small amount yesterday to try my first swing trade hoping it will take the same pattern it has over the past weeks. More volume this time so I might be wrong
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:16:34
Doesn't he say to do your research and that this is all speculative like 3 times per video?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:41:48
Wasn't the whole point of divisibility to do away with the idea that you don't need a whole number just a value? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:22:42
Researching buying some as well
Will the pending affect the price you pay?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:32:10
What about others?

This isn't really a good thing.

Why do people who hold Bitcoin dislike any blockchain development or improvement that isn't Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:39:37
But the ideologues from 4 years ago were raving about blockchain and some still are. I think they are just attached.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:57:35
On average it owns 40% of the market even though on most coins it had a 6-7 year head start. It's not needless, if it was needless Bitcoin would have 100% because everyone would like and use it. That 40% proves dissatisfaction with it and tells of room for improvement which thinking back to November the Bitcoin community isn't even interested in. The Bitcoin community can't even decide on what direction to take, how many forks already? How many forks of forks? But it Literally stifles growth just having only the first coin, almost, centralized?
Plus blockchain tech in and of it itself can continue without even being a currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:26:11


So less than 40% lol?
Should the internet just be Amazon because it came first and all these other ones are just Johnny-come-lately sites who saw a chance to get rich?
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:27:27
A small coin can still fundamentally be better.

Same, I was bent on getting it 100&amp; anonymous and I couldn't meet my own standards so I never did. What a stupid reason to not buy.
