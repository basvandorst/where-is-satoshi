How do i delete the trezor and recover it from seed, any tutorials on this?

You've bought 10k worth through blockchain wallet?

Depending on the amount I'd seriously start considering buying a hardware wallet such as Trezor, or Ledger Nano S. You'll have complete control of your private keys, and from what i'm understanding virtually unhackable if you follow some simple physical security protocols.

how long have you had your hand in?

GDAX sits ontop of the the coinbase technology doesn't it?

No you will never get it off of the blockchain wallet. At the moment the fees are outrageously high.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:18:02
Buy and hold. (HODL) rinse and repeat in amounts you can afford
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:22
Yes it does, but I'm told if the fees too low then it could eventually be rejected. Although i may be wrong on that.

Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt

I would, and have myself. Been buying small amounts now for a few months. Invested in a Trezor, just set it up and about to take the plunge in transferring. Still worried that i could lose the lot, as my gains have been tremendous on small regular outlays.

Please expand on these tips. From my noob perspective, sounds like wiping the device would delete everything on it.

I know i'm a fucking idiot using blockchain wallet, but a week ago it would have cost me around $50 just to send my measly amount to another wallet
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:59:33
thanks for that. I thought i mentioned paper wallets in the description. So if i set up paper wallets with key password phrases for each wallet, what then? How would it stop me stealing their btc

Whats the trezor like?
