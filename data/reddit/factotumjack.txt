Yes, what exactly does this mean? Is that a massive premine?  It's not mentioned in the comparison.
This seems like a big hacking target if it is, but I can see the rationale behind it.

*If I'm reading this article correctly*, this refers to crowdfunded  **securities**, and not all crowdfunding. I've looked around, and from what I can tell, this would mean if the funder rewards are stock, bonds, or other such financial instrument. If the reward was non monetary, like a copy of the product being funded, a t-shirt, etc. ,  that wouldn't seem to fall under securities, would it?
Am I interpreting this correctly? (X-Post to other subreddits for more answers)

This is a reasonable response to India's currency crisis. 
India had some major  counterfeiting problems, so their government decided that certain  denominations (500 and 1000 rupees iirc) would no longer be legal tender. They did so with a very short grace period, causing a massive rush to deposit the soon to be worthless bills. Even here in Canada, the foreign exchanges stopped accepting rupees outright.
This gives the government a chance to reissue with better counterfeiting protection, but it's a major life disruption, and a textbook case of why people want cryptocurrency.

No, it would mean that mining with anything else would be pointless.
There is only one block of 50 bitcoins available to be mined every ten minutes, regardless of the amount of computer power used for mining. Faster mining software doesn't mean more bitcoins in total, just a greater share of the mined bitcoins for that user.

Thanks, I'll do that today.
Edit: Spent the afternoon on the forum learning the ropes and going through the marketplace and the work sites linked from there. It looks like it's very much an employer's market right now, far more sellers than buyers. People offering similar services are charging way less than I would and what I would expect them to charge in USD or CAD.
I'll keep visiting the forum as an option for sure, but right now it's not the market I'm looking for.

There should be an equilibrium point where the increased number of bitcoins per computation brings some miners back. Also, how much processing power does bitcoin need to stay secure, if it "currently represents the largest distributed computing network in the world"?
I was talking about working with amazon on bitcointalk a bit. We could try cutting a deal with amazon to outsource grid work. The problem is that amazon would have to buy bitcoins at an unstable price for use later. If the price drops again, it could end up being more expensive to outsource and deal in bitcoins than to do the computations in house.
I suppose this would reduce the raw mining power, but give miners another source of income. Maybe that would be enough to keep mining numbers up enough.

My browser shows that link as a suspect https, care to explain?

I'll do statistical analysis for Bitcoins.
