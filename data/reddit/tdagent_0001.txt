Well, I think at this point a good chunk of people in the US want the world to stay static for a bit so they can get their bearings. Only problem is, they want to be on top when things stop changing.

All systems revert to their lowest possible energy state. In other terms, everything dies. Right now we're trying to hedge based on what we believe will be the new force which takes over when the old system dies. 
Static borders don't exist, look at Crimea.
Static laws and ethics don't exist, look at the changes to Supreme Court rulings.

Well, I wouldn't say ALL cloud is mining is a ponzi. When new altcoins come out, companies like nicehash see a huge spike in business from people trying to get in early on the first few coins and beat the competition to the market.
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:36:46
To add fuel to the fire, the increased market cap would be ((float current inflows)+new inflows/float total cap. Of course we can expect a larger float with higher prices, but probably not on the scale of the capital increases. Even if the float doubles, Our current capital inflows are ~$1,500,000/day. The new would be 1.5+(300/7)= $44.3 million/ day. To stay at current prices, with little to no change from the influx we would need to see whales dumping 55k coins/day. I could see 10k coins a day max. So, we quintuple the size of the float over that week and we'll see an easy $5k/BTC in the first week.

Well, discounting burned coins and coins which will continue to be burned. increasing the price of the float, which represents a very small fraction of the total coins would only take a few million dollars but increase the market cap by billions at a time.
@_date: 2016-12-02 00:44:20
Interesting. I hadn't even considered the gold market cap, however I suspect most of these transfers of gold occur at the executive level, where this is decentralized.
On the one hand we could analyze small-scale individual gold transactions and derive a market capitalization from that, but given the high likelihood of implementation of an exterior layer of zero-confirmation transaction we could possibly integrate a portion of the world cash-basis cap as well.
It would be a godsend if someone developed a swipable card which came into common usage.

I see this as a problematic aspect of the current growth cycle. Much of the gains have been through canibalization of other crypto currencies. Currencies like doge/tips/random jokecoin make good introductory primers for newbies. They can mine a few coins themselves with no investment and develop an understanding of how the systems work.
Also, for many, mining alt coins and feeding them to market speculators is one of the only ways of gathering* BTC in any real amount without plunking down significant sums of fiat.
Where I see the development of BTC as an end state goal, I believe sacrificing the alternative currencies will lead to both stagnation of development and adoption. Keep the alt currencies strong, and bitcoin will have a buffer.

I believe that the proponents of the current climate change model are nothing but profiteers. 
1) I think tearing down mountain ranges for coal has a big impact on climate.
2) When I was a kid it was "global cooling/coming ice age", then it was global warming, now climate change.
3) How long have shaman and tribal elders been using the weather to stay in power? It's an old trope that still works, where none of them have any real power over the situation. I think any issues as presented need to be viewed from a solutions standpoint, not a lets dump billions into "research" done by unknown third parties. 
You can take numerous figures available which range from $10-100 Billion USD annually and figure out how many trees could be planted. We need to take hold of the argument and develop it into one everyone can get behind with real positive change.

Okay, so to play devil's advocate. He is suggesting that US currency has backing, which is backing of the debt of force of law which states that federal debt shall not default. I get his stance, and it's based on his reality and understanding of Keynesian Economics, by which an economy thrives not on production but debt instruments, which force people to produce in order to keep their heads above water. I think it was a left-field question on a topic for which he has little need or understanding. He has his 400k/year university position and pension fund, so bitcoin isn't relevant to him.

The issue with me is that the billions poured into research could go to plant trees and develop cleaner systems and power generation.
No, I don't believe in man-made climate change. Yes, I like a clean environment and smog free cities.

I wouldn't say 100% of Fortune 500, maybe 66%.

That's largely because Japan is an export dominant economy. Their consumption per capita is much lower than in the US.

Interesting view on the trend, but I seem to have little faith in metrics which attempt to gauge emotional buy/sell behavior. I fully expect the swing to be a downward trend on 12/8 if one occurs.

Means you can buy a tad cheaper. Honestly I would expect more of a price drop from half a day's  worth of bitcoin being sold

I did a search for top 100 bitcoin wallets

Nightmare? I'd call that a second chance

An issue I could see developing. If it is labeled a currency, then when a bitcoin is generated it is automatically taxable income. We would be required to sell a portion of our mining intake in order to pay ordinary tax rates. Frankly, LTCG rates are preferable.
I want it to be treated as a real currency as much as everyone else, but the tax burden will be onerous.

That's what I'm hoping for. I haven't purchased. I've been slowly mining.

I was wondering about that because I found their exchange fees chart and it didn't make much sense to my non-etf brain. Good to know. I have no issues (yet) about supporting the winklevii in their business ventures.

I have .31 bitcoin and I'm ranked ~900770. With 10 millions BTC wallets as of January, I'm in the top 9%

Probably a cardboard clad disposable.

You'll probably want tree fiddy

It would be interesting if we could arrive at 1 bit transactions to casually buy a stick of gum

I don't think you're curious. I think you're sanctimonious. There's a difference.

Hundreds of billions??? I hadn't heard that, but if that amount is applied to the float (the number in traded circulation), then we would be talking trillions of market cap.

Okay, an excerpt from a separate article concerning treatment of bitcoin in Texas. I googled it after reading these twitter snippets.
"In his memo, Cooper provided reasoning that echoed the IRS. Last month, the federal agency announced that, for tax purposes, it would treat Bitcoin as property instead of currency because no government recognizes the virtual currency as legal tender." -Texas Tribune 2014
SO. We need to bribe some small country, say Liechtenstein, to recognize it as currency. Once this is completed, any transactions we conduct, without converting the currency to our local currency will be simply a standard cash transaction with no tax implications.
HODL the LINE!

technically correct, I suppose.
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:04:49
Oye, then I could still buy... carry the three, times six... 700 pints! Rounds on the house!

Does the mining software automatically filter through and find the transactions with the highest fees and prioritize those?

Trying to claw my way up from 0.35 the hard way. Need my 1 BTC

The IRS MAY request some sort of proof or documentation. 
  Replace asterix on keyboard with your bitcoin address.
This will provide dates and values for profit loss calculations and provide a visual for the IRS should they request it. This is assuming you kept the bitcoin in a personal wallet, rather than on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:57:05
Well, If you used 11000 addresses you're going to have a bad time.

We use quantum entanglement to keep all the wallets synchronized! As long as there is a single quantum entangled central node then the other sub nodes on each planet will all be on the same page.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:39:00
Nah, just some organization or committee with a wallet they keep synced via a special quantum entanglement internet connection that instantly transfers data from earth.

Well, when people show up with houses that are outside their financial means, they will start asking questions. From there, during an audit they will request applicable documents. As such, sending your coins through a mixer for the sole purpose of obfuscation is ill advised, and makes it look as though you have something to hide.

Well, most likely, if the individual cannot disclose proper basis for the capital, or the individual is being difficult or refusing to cooperate, then it will go to court, where either a) a task force will be established to determine tax liability, depending on the sum involved, or b) the individual will be responsible for the entire value of the bitcoin sold as taxable.
