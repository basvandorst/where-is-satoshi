I mean WE don’t believe in the banks, that’s why we’re all here right? I meant from the outside perspective of Joe American picking up a newspaper and seeing GS opening Bitcoin trading, it makes look less like drug smuggling anarchists and more like the growing international presence that we’ve become.

Having an investment group like GS will help ‘bring credibility to crypto’. I totally agree with this. While it seems counterintuitive for a major US banking organization to get involved in crypto, I think this will bring an influx of new money into BTC and ultimately help increase its value.

Looks like Bitcoin just did a double cookie dunk. We’ll come out of this tasting delicious.

EVERYONE RELAX. I found out the dog knocked the fiat coins out of my money tree a few days ago. I just replaced them in their proper spots so we should all be rich soon.

What’s with these high plateau sell offs? It’s like these idiots don’t understand bitcoin strategy at all. BUY HIGH SELL LOW

Based on my intensive analysis on absolutely nothing, I predict a price increase tomorrow.

I’ve sold my first born child!
@_date: 2019-10-25 14:06:01
Yesterday I used my intensive analysis of absolutely nothing to determine that the price was going to go up today. Further research of nothing has lead me to determine that the price will continue to go up tomorrow.

Just come visit Vegas where weed is legal and the drinks are free. As soon as you get here just put everything you have on the Miami Dolphins to win the Super Bowl. The odds are 50,000:1. It’s such a deal. You’re like, losing money NOT doing it.

So rookie question: If the price drops below what is profitable/needed for ROI on mining equipment, will the cost of mining equipment see a drop? 
I don't have the tech savvy to set up a mining rig, I was just curious how inflated the tech has become. 
I see listings online for USB sticks (which look pretty much useless) as well as some of the more hondo miners (which people try to get rid of as soon as something faster/has greater capabilities comes out).

We’re heading into winter, so we’re probably entering a spliff cross. The Chicago Bears have a losing record right now, so OSO investors might be getting sleepy.
EDIT: Bears are 3-3, might be heading into a Matt Groening

Sooo Coinbase just went down.
