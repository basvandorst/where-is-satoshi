Read "history of the American currency" and you may learn there has been some crazier things done with money in this country's history. It's a really interesting read but I do agree bitcoins is very groundbreaking but there still is room for failure

"CryptoLocker, a new Windows ransomware virus sweeping across the country, hit the Swansea Police Department on Nov. 6. The virus encrypted several files that could only be decrypted through the purchase of Bitcoins, an unregulated digital currency, to pay for the special “decryption key.” A countdown clock appeared on a computer screen showing how much time the department had to buy the key before all the files were deleted."
