Well, it's about government censorship which is something this sub usually finds interesting. But anyway, it looks like they removed it. Here's a Google cache if anyone is still interested.

To be clear, were you able to actually able to withdraw stolen bitcoin from Coinbase? I see that your vault balance went negative, but presumably they have some method in place to prevent withdrawals from your wallet if one of your balances is negative.

It would be nice if the reporter will approve releasing the bug report so that we can see for ourselves what was said.
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:21:32
When did you report the bug? Those bounties have been listed on the website for as long as I can remember.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:04:43


It sounds like they probably should have paid out a second bounty to you. But $5k is in both in line with what they promise on their [bug bounty page]( and also comparable to what much larger, public companies are paying out [1]( [2]( [3]( So it seems like a pretty decent reward, obviously you could have exploited it yourself, but the point of a bug bounty program is to be rewarded for being a good citizen.

So we are allowed to discuss a pull request which is caused by a tweet about Coinbase running BIP 101 *as an experiment*, but we are not allowed to discuss the actual tweet itself? Can someone clarify where the censorship line is drawn in this sub?
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:21:07
Unfortunately, this is not true for a hard fork. For a hard fork to be successful, we need 100% of the network to agree to a network upgrade, otherwise it ends in disaster (network split). BIP 101 and other proposals are a hard fork, so cannot simply be steamrolled out to the rest of the network by miners.
For a soft fork, this is completely accurate. Miners can deploy a change, and as long as the majority of them agree to it then that becomes the new network by default. Many recent upgrades, such as BIP65 / OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY were deployed with a soft fork.

Not sure what you mean by "looking accounts up". Assume you mean locking? Every legitimate company that sells Bitcoin has to close accounts that are obviously involved with illegal activity, so just use Coinbase/Circle, stay on the right side of the law, and don't worry about it. $5k is not a huge amount so you won't get questions for that, although you might have to make a few smaller purchases as your daily limit ramps up. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:57:04
There are many cards with no annual fee, any one from the major banks will do (remember Coinbase only supports Visa &amp; Mastercard). If you use Uber I recommend checking out Capital One Quicksilver, it has no annual fee and gives you a 20% discount on Uber rides until April 2016.

Is the hackerone bug public? If not can you request disclosure so that we can see the bugs you reported?
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:52:39
For tax purposes, it's kind of irrelevant where you send your Bitcoin after buying them. Coinbase know you bought them, and if an auditor ever thought to look there they would see your purchase in plain sight. I also expect at some point in future Coinbase will start sending annual summaries for tax purposes. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:36:32


Correct. Capital gains don't apply until you sell/dispose of the bitcoin.


Overkill. If your goal is to lie and say that you spent/sent them to a friend therefore disposed immediately with 0 capital gains, then you can do that already. There is no way for anyone to know who the breadwallet address belongs to. Saying there is "no proof of ownership" implies that you are going to claim you have no idea where you sent the coins, which is likely just going to lead to more questions/trouble.
Of course, all these lies are a terrible idea. Just buy the bitcoin you want, hodl, and if you sell them for a large profit in future then pay your taxes and be happy.
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:38:51
Come on. I doubt they care about you arbitraging between Circle and Coinbase, but it's well known that trading on LBC makes you an MSB, and the regulatory / banking environment in the U.S. prevents the exchanges here from servicing MSB customers. 
If you want to trade on LBC, you need to get your coins elsewhere.

"Opt in" RBF is a lie. If only 10% of miners opt in, then it means scammers can successfully double spend merchants 10% of the time, which is a fucking disaster. 
This basically puts an end to large merchants accepting Bitcoin alongside credit cards, and in-person localbitcoin trades. Oh well, I guess Bitcoin will still be useful for other things. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 08:52:34
Clearly no one that says the 21co Bitcoin computer is a revolutionary tool for developers has actually developed anything before. This is the kind of product that should be a purely software product, there is zero need for it to be tied up in a $400 box. 
It's like someone telling you that there is a new http web framework, but you need to plug a hardware device into your computer to use it, because that would somehow make it easy to get started. This is completely nonsensical. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:08:24
I'm not sure. The main arguments seem to be that it is more complicated, and because Todd supports my first point above (we should permanently break 0conf transactions because they are not 100% safe).
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:09:51
I see. Thanks for the information, that makes things quite a bit better than I previously thought.

Replace-by-fee means that nodes will now accept and relay double spends for certain transactions, and miners will mine these transactions into blocks. 
The version that has been merged is opt-in, so when you make a transaction, you can flag it saying "I want to be able to double spend this transaction". Merchants will be able to see this, so will know not to trust your transaction until it has confirmations. 
To fully understand RBF, you must realize that zero-confirmation (0-conf) transactions in Bitcoin are never guaranteed to be safe. The only reason they are moderately safe to accept is that most nodes will not relay a double spend of a transaction they have already seen. Many companies like BitPay and Coinbase have technology to check if a transaction has been seen by most of the Bitcoin network, then accept it before it has any confirmations. However, Bitcoin's primary mechanism for guaranteeing that a transaction will not be double spent is mining them into the blockchain, so if you want to be sure a transaction is safe you should always wait for at least a few confirmations. 
You should also know that accepting double spends is purely rational behavior for miners. If they see a transaction that double spends an existing, unconfirmed transaction, and has a higher miner fee, then it is in their best interest to accept the new transaction with a higher fee. This means that miners are theoretically leaving money on the table. 
There are two reasons that Peter Todd has been pushing RBF for quite a while:
1) Unconfirmed transactions are not technically safe to rely on, but some people do. We should break them for everyone so that people no longer rely on this behavior. 
2) Sometimes people make a transaction and forget to add a fee, or add a fee that is too low. If the transaction is taking too long to confirm (for example during a Bitcoin stress test, or period of high volume), it would be nice if people could replace this transaction with a new one with a higher fee.
The second point is actually a decent use case. Todd had an alternative proposal called "first seen safe" replace-by-fee, which would allow you to increase the fee on an existing transaction, but not change the recipient address, meaning that it does not allow you to double spend merchants. However, this option was not merged into Bitcoin core. The version that was merged allows you to replace your transaction with a completely different one sending money to different people (or back to yourself).
Edit: for all the folks downvoting me, if it's not clear already, I don't actually agree with the points above, or RBF in general. I'm simply explaining what it is and what other people think about it, at the request of OP.

Actually this is a perfectly reasonable option. Miners would be incentivized to create blocks which are small enough that they propagate quickly given current network speed/conditions (otherwise their newly mined blocks may be replaced by others which propagated faster).
To avoid the "malicious miner creates 10TB block and crashes the network" problem, there are a couple of tweaks which could be used to prevent this.
The first option is to add a floating block size limit (e.g. 10x the median size of last 2016 blocks). This would prevent one massive block from being broadcast, but still allow the network to scale up to meet demand during busy periods.
The second option would be to allow clients to implement a "soft" block size limit. This means that a client would not by default relay blocks that are over 8mb in size (for example), BUT if a second block is seen which builds on that first block then it is accepted as valid. This system would allow miners to soft fork the network to basically any block size with a majority of hash power.
The reason this has not been adopted or discussed much is that (a) no one has written a BIP or code for it, and (b) many of the core developers don't think that unlimited block sizes are a good thing, either because they believe in a "fee market" (forcing smaller block sizes to increase miner fees and better incentivize miners), or because they believe that one should be able to run a full node on a modest home internet connection (whereas miners will generally have much better network connections).

Great question.

This doesn't really make things any less secure than already using a centralized service to store your bitcoin.
If the US Government wants to know about your account, it would be much easier to ask the company in question (since most of them are US based) rather than hack Cloudflare, which has an outstanding security reputation and even [counts banks among its customers](
Also, assuming that Cloudflare was compromised, people would immediately notice that their bitcoin was being sent to random places, or their deposit addresses were incorrect. Within about 5 minutes everyone would be able to deduce what happened, and the centralized services would shut down access to their wallets, most likely refunding the customers who were affected which I imagine would be covered by their insurance policy (could be a bit more tricky for blockchain.info etc).

I advise people about all sorts of things, that doesn't mean I'm getting paid. Most startups like to list well-known people as "advisors" to make them sound more promising to investors. Unless Gavin or someone else comes out to explicitly say he is getting paid for this advice, I would assume he is not.

They used to ban accounts that scored highly on their fraud algorithm, but everyone complained. Now you get a low daily limit and a chance to prove yourself. So make a purchase and your limit should increase.

@_date: 2015-11-09 16:55:54
I'm not saying there aren't other problems with unlimited block sizes, but this is not one of them. In the scenario you describe, the miner in question would be incentivized to start creating smaller blocks if the network speed is not good enough to relay 10mb blocks, so that they don't miss out on the block reward to a smaller block. So a perfectly rational miner will only create blocks small enough to relay quickly around the network.

We don't need an emulator, that would be super inefficient on production servers anyway. In the near future someone will launch an open source Bitcoin server that does everything the 21co device can do and more.

What I'm saying is that you don't need an all in one hardware and software stack. This is a cool software product, inexplicably packaged with a raspberry pi and an overpriced mining chip. Neither of the second two components are required to build Bitcoin-powered projects.

Ok, I'll accept that at least one actual developer is excited about it. I think Garzik has drunk the cool aid though, I have yet to see him make a convincing argument for why this is good.

Well, apart from being owned by PayPal they also use the same banking partner, which is ultimately who is doing business with you.
You haven't given us any description of what your business actually does, but if I were you I would create an accurate description of your business while staying away from "hot" words such as cryptocurrency/blockchain, then try your luck with Stripe or any of the other card processors.
Also, generally there are are real people making these decisions, so if you get in touch with the right person (not just emailing support) and provide a convincing argument as to why your business is legit, and why you are not a MSB or chargeback risk, they would most likely accept it.
