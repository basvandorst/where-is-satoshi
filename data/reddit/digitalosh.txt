I want logic to win, but I don't intend to fight my battles in a venue where I'm sure to lose. If you have an issue with the tax system you need to take that up with the law. As opposed to breaking the law to make your point. 2 wrongs don't make a right

I'm all for optimism, but let's get real here. We are a TINY niche and the training for bitcoin alone is enough of a barrier to prevent it from happening.

I would tell them to contact their elected officials about getting rid of such a nonsensical law. But back to the point, you are very specifically asking how to lie to the government and break the law which leads me to repeat my statement, breaking the law is neither a valid nor a feasible form of protest.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:51:13
Because if everybody decided that the law should be based on their interpretation we would be left with anarchy. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:18:13
Oh good point. Wait, no. Not a good point. It's still the law and enforced as such.

I can stick my credit card in any ATM and get cash... Interest charges start on the day I take the money out, but that's fine, I can get the cash when I need it... And similarly I can transfer money from my credit card to my stock account and buy stocks. So that's out too
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:22:56
I agree with this, it would just be a further reduction of the barrier to entry and cause further adoption.

Except that he's right. Go educate yourself. TL;DR: the market price is determined by the order book. there will be an ask and a bid. When these 2 come together and exchange CAD or USD for BTC, the price of BTC during that exchange is pegged as the new price. Basically, it was the last price the buyer and seller could agree on.

I'm no expert, but why will there eventually be zero? As bitcoin deflates, more and more people will have satoshis vs full bitcoins, and on and on. And the amount of bitcoin lost will decrease at the same rate. Bitcoin 'suffers' the opposite effect of fiat in that with Fiat, 'Million', 'Billion' and 'Trillion' are becoming more and more common amounts of USD, for example. Conversely, Satoshis, bitcents, and their divisors will be more common for bitcoin over time.

Comment 
so accurate. We have a new Nostradamus
Quoted for posterity: I also discussed with satoshi, and he said that his employers at the NSA wanted him to create the first P2P currency with a back door in it. That back door happens to be in this specific elliptic curve. Government supercomputers searched for a random elliptic curve that contained a back door.
Just joking, but that's my conspiracy theory. Actually if there is no particular reason for this elliptic curve to be chosen, that is actually suspicious...

How exactly would you implement this tax? How could you force people to send bitcoins to the 'tax system'? If I generate a wallet and send coins to it, print it and shut down bitcoin-QT how would you ever, even if implemented protocol-wide, institute a tax?

Honestly, satoshidice does a great job of laying out odds and has a far more transparent system than most fiat gambling systems. I am aware of the math and do partake in some satoshidice gambling from time to time, and I am glad that the option is open to me.

Wow, I've never seen someone so artfully defuse an unfriendly comment. Kudos.
I know that this is not a final number, but the suggestion that a 1%/month tax on bitcoin is a good idea is crazy. That's a 12%/year tax, 6x what you'd get as REWARD for hoarding money at the bank. Again, I know it's a theoretical number and that the actual amount would be much smaller, but the point is **penalizing savings is a bad idea** and will not resonate with the bitcoin community.
I understand the problem with lost bitcoins being lost, but I think the idea that we can divide them infinitely makes up for that issue much better than instituting a network-wide tax would
