I feel like so much of this would have been avoided if Coinbase had just announced the date BCASH would be available well in advance.  Make a decision, set a deadline, make it happen.  Insider trading, collusion, etc. goes out the window if they don't keep the release date a secret.

Just want to clarify something.  If you had never lost your Ledger you wouldn't have to go through the restore feature, correct?  Did you just want to see how resetting it worked?  Is it possible to send small funds to make sure it goes through and then transfer a larger amount?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:44
Is going through the recovery feature just to get familiar with it in case you need to in the future?  It's not necessary every time is it?

Do you expect both BTC and BCH to go up?  I'm curious what will happen to BCH price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:39:55
What do y'all predict will happen to the two communities when coinbase allows withdrawals of BCH on Jan 1st?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:14
I thought when BCH was on coinbase, it was only going to be allowed to be sold.  That doesn't seem to be the case.  Any thing on this?

My question relates more to transferring to USD.  Coinbase charges 1% to cash out.  Could I send my bitcoin somewhere else and not play a percentage to cash out.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:42:31
I dont want to cash out.  I only have 3.  I'd like to see how high the price goes.  Wondering more for the future.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:03:57
Can I transfer my bitcoin from coinbase to another site, and then cash out at a lower percentage rate than coinbase charges.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:19:30
Why did I get downvoted for asking a question.  I just want to know more about the fluctuations in price.

Can you tell me why Bitcoin has fallen $200 in the last 36 hours?
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:29:01
Can someone explain something to me?  If bitcoin keeps going up in value what is the point of spending it?  Also, what do you predict will happen to the value after all coins are mined or sold?
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:43:38
If the fork happens, please explain how the coins double within the blockchain please.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:34:44
IIRC, scarcity is one of the driving factors of value.  Uniqueness is not. One could argue that Bitcoin is both unique and scarce.  It will be interesting to see which one prevails.

Do you know how to buy futures once CME opens trading?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:51:47
Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:08:30
When coinbase gives access to Bcash in January, what kind of effect do y'all think that will have on price?  Do you think most will sell Bcash to buy Bitcoin?

Helps a lot.  I use 2fa now, but I've had a phone stop charging on me out of nowhere.  It wouldn't turn on at all.  I have backup keys, but was curious the best way to transfer when the time comes for a new phone.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:39:44
Can you ELI5?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:37:47
When the time comes to get a new phone, what is the proper way to handle this?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:02:39
What's your best elevator pitch to people when they ask?
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:32:50
What is the best way to pull coins off of an exchange?  I have Bitcoin and Ether on coinbase?  Is there an easy way to convert those to cold storage.  If so, how do you convert back when you want to sell.  I feel like my coins might be safer on coinbase than in my possession.  So many horror stories about people losing keys......
