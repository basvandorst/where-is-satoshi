Ok but what about the $600,000 you would lose overnight?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:42
So the bubble started two weeks ago (12k) and ended today? Seems like a short cycle. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:54:49
Where’s the alert for it falling below 10k?

Advice: Don't invest in bitcoin futures unless you understand how margin works.

A drop of this size after the amount of inflow should concern you.  At 5-8k this was still in the media attention / enthusiasm stage. This is now in the denial stage heading towards fear.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:11
I mean... it’s still down 10% and on a 4 day decline.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:18:58
The price will keep growing for certain? That’s a little bold.

Ah the clear mind of John McAfee.

It doesn't apply to a situation until you look at a chart in hindsight.

You think I actually own this garbage? LOL

If you’re serious about learning more about investing bitcoin is not the place to be. The price movements are highly unpredictable and at this point it is a purely speculative play. Creating a portfolio of stocks that follow earning cycles would be a good place to truly learn.

Are you mad because I’m not giving you trolling credit or something?

Ok...this is exactly what I said. Maybe you don’t understand that capital gains are part of your taxable income and are used to determine your tax bracket? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:40:48
You note that you will likely try to live off 37.5k income per year from selling crypto... Saying you are fully sold out wouldn't you need to make a sizable investment in crypto (at current and future levels) for that to occur? 
Do you forsee any fears of not being diversified enough during retirement by having that much cash tied to crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:55:58
Have you ever filed taxes? I seriously doubt you have if you don’t know this. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:09:48
Ok that’s due to capital gains being taxed around 20% instead of as ordinary income. Has nothing to do with determining your tax bracket. I’m done man go do your homework.

One more thing to point out here - the term 'if you make' includes the sale of bitcoins not just a salary. So OP could earn zero dollars and sell $37,450 in Bitcoins before being taxed.  If he makes $10,000 at a part time job, he can sell up to $27,450 before being taxed etc..

I’m sorry but whoever wrote that does not understand futures trading. You would go long the security and short the future to expose pricing anomalies between the contracts and security. There is no money lending or interest gained here. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:02:06
Because there are no fundamentals to back up a 1000% price increase against the USD.

Warren Buffet makes a pretty good living on long term investing 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:05
So you think people who make a LIVING trading stocks just avoid long term capital gains. You realize there are people who live on trading (there only income is capital gains). They don’t just go untaxed on the long term side.
Read up on this.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:17:14
I could be mistaken but I think you’re wrong. By what you’re saying  a gain of 1 million dollars on bitcoin would go untaxed and that will just never happen. The gain is considered income and OP would have to keep sales under 37.5k per year to go untaxed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:41:42
Why would anyone buy anything with something that fluctuates 10% per day. At this point this is a commodity not a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:55:18
IRS.gov should have info on it. I’ve filed taxes on capital gains (and losses)the past 6 years and it counts as taxable income. To think it doesn’t is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:26:58
You can’t just realize capital gains and not pay taxes... would love to know your secret that no other person in the entire finance industry knows!!  Why the f*** would people use 401ks if we could just retire and pull our capital gains tax free. LOL.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:28:48
Tulip Mania.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:31:32
Please continue on how I’m wrong that bitcoin gains will not be taxed over 37.5k
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:52:09
Does the increased volume and the addition of futures and more sophisticated investors (hedge funds) since previous crashes scare you? 
No one seems to address the increased trading volume and I think that’s a mistake as larger volumes typically lead to an asset obtaining fair value far faster than low volume trading...
