@_date: 2019-07-16 15:58:38
What you guys were thinking? Bitcoin could creep its way to 10 million and govts watch it all happen sucking lollypops... it’s all going according to plan... self fullfilling prophecy...people who even are not involved with bitcoin are talking about bitcoin ...tryna copy it ..Facebook is biggest example... regulations are needed... else it will be a keyoss and anarchy.... regulations are coming and bitcoin will be 10 million a piece...

@_date: 2019-07-17 19:49:05
The irony is mr. Oliery or whatever’s solution to his problems of money transfer is right in front of his eyes and he is not seeing it with clear vision. Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:52:03

@_date: 2019-07-09 19:46:02
Can’t stop thinking was at 3.2 k start of year.. if you would have loaned 1 mill bought it could have tripled to 3 million and retired in 6 months lol crazy
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:48:22
Exactly what I was thinking. Specially Munchin saying bitcoin can be new Swiss bank accounts minus no control of anyone. Simply unconfiscable bank accounts
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:47:05
Eth is just pow after failed scaling.. if it scales then it can else it’s going to be absolute

You got it see my hint words helped you
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:28:34
If you guys can look up yearly gold production vs bitcoin production you will understand which is more scarce and why even going back to gold standard will not do anything to bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:20:14

@_date: 2019-07-31 00:41:33
In other words the whale would rent the hashpower and double spent 468 mill making 467.something mill dollars profit with 51k$ rented hashpower if it was that easy
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:25:13
How much? Can I book two for year 2021?

You will repeat this for under 1 mill in 7 years from now
@_date: 2019-07-30 01:52:12
No one deserves privacy in this world imho more than safety that’s only way govts can keep you safe from money launderers terrirists etc.. wait isn’t money still laundered despite all this and terrorists still exist... so why gather everyone’s data and leak it to money launderers terrirists so they can use it.. wtf a whole circle
@_date: 2019-07-24 04:17:59
Longs are not always equal to shorts...and vice versa...whom pays the difference 8$ is not going to make up for it..get it?
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:36:30

@_date: 2019-07-24 12:35:51
Yea you need 10% of your assets more liquid like fiat so you can pay electricity water and other govt bills and other day to day expenses which govt would not recognize with bitcoin so for day to day living you need some cash that’s why. Usd would be still needed in 2.5% cases and Libra for online purchases etc on Facebook
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:57:08
You still need bitcoins to move the markets... and make profits... the more markets like this the more demand bitcoin has..
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:29:32
What if thepoliticians and rich businessman are trying to keep bitcoin exclusive for themselves? It’s their new Swiss bank account
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:38:41

So naive you are right... Hint: I am Zuck I am a smart businessman. I have net worth 60 bill. I am going to buy 10 bill btc first then enable lightning advertise btc on 2bill user platform bank the unbanked with lightning on my FB. Bitcoin price skyrockets after all the hype and increased users to 500-1 Mill a piece and I make 300 bill profits within a year. I am smart.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:04:00
I sometimes feel bad doing that. But seeing all of these projects lose to bitcoin after 10 years just makes me mad at times. I think it’s high time all developers work for bitcoin and further improve it for other use cases rather than fooling people make them buy next bitcoin. There is no next bitcoin. Hence I hate other projects because they are money grabbers
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:37:50
Yes seems right not worth to do a 51% on btc unless you just want to discredit btc by losing your money for example a state in which case community will fight back and btc will rise again with the state losing by billions eventually

@_date: 2019-03-18 01:59:53
When high fees.. ? right now it’s in cents? Is like that for whole year after dec 2017.. a month or so due to speculation bubble should not be a reason to alter things... we should not be worried about temporary high transaction fees which happen during peak of the bubble... we need to address that with pace of adoption which is going smooth currently 
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:45:57
The only way Facebook can come up with a btc killer is they install an independent full node wallet software via their fb app in each phone running a crypto network on 1.2 billion Facebook users with no central control . They can keep some premine coins but airdrop remaining to all fb users equally. They need to make every user mandatory to install the wallet node with fb regardless of they use it or not

@_date: 2019-03-17 18:05:11
I think this is a correct pace of scaling for btc. Lightning will evolve with btc pace of mass adoption which is not going to happen overnight. I do not think btc transactions costs will ever reach ATH with respect to mass adoption. Only speculators drive it high which we don’t need anyways to create another bubble. I think btc is all set to be a global currency at this pace. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 11:12:03
Use AppImage on Linux lite works great

Its simple.... the only way bitcoin may go down is a catastrophic code bug or network collapse... which is impossible to see...there are 3000 plus testnets now and I havent heard of complete failure of any coins due to a bug.. at max they fork and keep going on.. that’s beauty... if it keeps on surviving without that, its users and network will grow as currently it has captured only 0.02% of worlds population. Imagine what happens when it captures 1-%, 10%, 50% population.::We all know how disruptive and superior it is to current monetary system and  no one can argue against it...so it basically needs few very strong holders and it will keep mooning... it’s like a bank controlled by holders which works 24X7 and no one can stop it...superior to any existing monetary system for humans...what else a human will want in today’s chaotic world...think about it...and you won’t sleep many days when you understand thoroughly what bitcoin is... it is not to get rich... it is about to get control of your hard earned money....

Hint :  1 btc equals 100 million satoshis so after 2140 miners will be rewarded in satoshis so say 100 satoshis initially and after that halving 50 satoshis since not exactly 21 million can’t be mined it will be somewhere say 20.95 btcs so satoshis can be continuously mined forever with infinite halvings only that 1 Satoshi will be increasing in value as bitcoin will be global currency and all worlds wealth will be stored in it. After satoshis are mined near full 1 Satoshi will be divisible as milisatoshi and so on... it’s insane to think that 1 Satoshi might someday reach 1 $ valuation but many years from now it may reach 1000$ only that there will be no $ it will be simply it’s value... once satoshis come to end milisatoshis then microsatoshis and so on as 21 million number is divisible into half upto infinite numbers...miners will never run out of rewards and continue mining...

This guy gets it... it’s needed to take bitcoin to unimaginable highs for a moment so everyone gets talking about it get noobs some convert to holders then repeat.. till 1 billion of 7 billion people become holders and hold 0.021 btc each.. and never sell ... price of bitcoin automatically reaches infinity at that point..

Bitcoin is technology not blockchain.... the incentive model is an inseparable part of any technology and bitcoin is the only crypto to achieve this hence saying many other technologies will be built on blockchain is a big myth... there is no blockchain without technologically designed incentive model that is must for it to survive... you will see all alts dying slow death in coming years only to realize there was no blockchain technology... there is only bitcoin technology

His prophecy ������������
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:02:10
Crappiest research ever seen��.
For simple reason That bitcoin survived when mining rewards were 1$ per block and today over 100k per block.
Calculating mining rewards in BTc and relating to its security is the biggest mistake one can do. 
As price of btc keeps on increasing reward halving doesn’t matter for miners as ultimately it’s the $ conversion that’s what Keep miners going. Year 2140 when 1 Satoshi will be 1 million $ miners will still keep mining and the code would be forked to continue mining . as the way Satoshi designed it there will not be complete 21 mill coins mined at 2140 but 20.97587 mill something so the last portion of btc can be decimaled to infinity to achieve microsats nano sats and so on rewards as price keeps increasing.
The only way it will fail is if people stop using it completely and price goes to zero which still is doubtful as it survived even when it had 1$ block reward.

That means you gotta hodl btc very tight that’s it... and not fomo selling at high fiat cost cause... the price will go to infinity and you will

Oh boy... you have lot to work on pal... google dlt
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:40:27
By 2140 there will be no virgin bitcoins though... this is another important feature of bitcoin is boost mining and grow ecosystem till then...mining and creating virgin bitcoins giving more benefits to miners... this feature is absent in all privacy coins hence no one will mine them over bitcoin ever.. we will continue to see hash rate ATH and no miner will go against consensus no matter what as the incentives are huge now including this premium... my mind is simply blowing away ..,what a genius Satoshi is/was...

Yea and this too miners can fork too to any other also and their money will be wasted ... they won’t risk that at first place till bitcoin is 0.01 percent of their gdp.. when it becomes over 10% everything will still hold true but now the expenses are even more to attack lol... sounds crazy but it’s impossible someone will ever attack bitcoin ever imho too much risk lol

Imagine you have 1 mill in your fdic insured bank account and then recession or some scam happens in your bank... the fdic gives you back 250k out of 1 million. Rest all is gone ...How would you feel? This  is prolly low for other countries... recently heard Indian banks froze withdrawal for 10$ every six months. 
Then you realize there is bitcoin which is unstoppable unseizable...and is unaffected by all this.... that moment will change your life once for all...
The true value of bitcoin is its censorship and scam or recession resistance ...which in my opinion far valuable than any other tech or companies in today’s world...there has never been a money like bitcoin in history of mankind ....
Every human will wake upto it today or 20 years later... there is no escaping it

The idea of deflationary currency is to stimulate economy as per human needs.

Well banks have only one or two server or nodes. Why are they not hacked often? I am sure it would not take a lot to do that but still very few get hacked
On other hand controlling 51% would need a lot of miners electricity like 1-2 bill $ for a sustained attack which we they will lose all after attack and if you have that much resources why not just make money by mining majority of coins with your power and staying honest rather than trying to go rogue with no guarantees that it will destroy bitcoin and losing your 1-2 bill $. 
Producing those many miners quickly is probably only possible for states like us China and not banks and that too as a defense project. That too would be only possible if they produce those many miners in 1-2 months anything longer the hashrate keeps mooning new ASICS keeps popping old ones becoming useless. So basically it would take a lot of efforts even for any state to do that.
People say China can simply control the pools it has but it would be hard to do as miners are basically making honest money for their families by running legit business. If China does that they will move with their miners to another friendly country.
 Also Community can add miners and regain control back and their efforts will again fail or community can decide to
fork the chain if gets too serious banning bad actors.

51% is impossible on bitcoin now...very unlikely if it does Confirmations can be increased to directly proportional threat... that’s beauty of protocol ...51% can temporarily slow down bitcoin but wont do shit to its integrity. Max we will have to wait 1 week for transactions on layer one which we already do with banks you know. Attacker will lose billions to sustain attack that long...Meanwhile use bitcoin nfc bills or lightning which will be unaffected if you already have open channels. Nothing changes even after 51% attack now for bitcoin...

That’s the whole point people miss with bitcoin unlike POS coins. To give any thing value some kind of creation costs are needed. That’s why POS is never going to work. Miners don’t sell btc if price falls below the creation value and stabilizes price. POS coins which are created with key strokes are valueless hence creators can sell anytime still making profits crashing stability . Bitcoin is such a genius idea that it’s never going to fail will always be number one SOV and medium of transactions from here on. It’s too late for currency alts to compete with btc imho. Small chance for a dapp coin to succeed if RSK doesn’t happen on bitcoin blockchain.

Crappiest research ever seen��.
For simple reason That bitcoin survived when mining rewards were 1$ per block and today over 100k per block.
Calculating mining rewards in BTc and relating to its security is the biggest mistake one can do. 
As price of btc keeps on increasing reward halving doesn’t matter for miners as ultimately it’s the $ conversion that’s what Keep miners going. Year 2140 when 1 Satoshi will be 1 million $ miners will still keep mining and the code would be forked to continue mining . as the way Satoshi designed it there will not be complete 21 mill coins mined at 2140 but 20.97587 mill something so the last portion of btc can be decimaled to infinity to achieve microsats nano sats and so on rewards as price keeps increasing.
The only way it will fail is if people stop using it completely and price goes to zero which still is doubtful as it survived even when it had 1$ block reward.

Yes all humans need second chance to get in btc at 100$ or less may be 1$ I hope whales can do this. Hope they sell all btc for fiat
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:08:23
And again when it goes to zero just buy 21 million btc and hodl so that it’s price goes to infinity then you can sell 1 btc for say 21 trillion and retire hope you understand now how expensive btc is

@_date: 2019-06-30 20:10:08
Haha a perfect meme
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:24:21

@_date: 2019-06-08 11:48:05
Why don’t you wait till it touches 1 mill and simply see if I am right or wrong
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:42:17
I would say you probably are break even or in profits already if you are doing it since March.. so cheers and keep accumulating and hodling....  two more years and you can pay all your debt and still have more than half of your bitcoins ready for retirement.. hodl on
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:25:39

Bring prices down to 100$ by mass production .. get some investors going..that’s how much raspi costs your business will boom also will help adoption... advertise market it... you are pioneers ... may become brand name once mass adoption occurs
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:40:33
Hodl on
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:57:10
You need to wait till 1 sat=1$ should be by 2025. Till then use it on LN since 
you can’t buy Anything with it anyways so no need for mainnet 
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:37:19

So US or some other country makes bitcoin their official currency how will India deal with that.. this is a lost battle for India already.. plus I heard bribing is very easy in India so enforcing that law would be impossible... Bitcoin will thrive in underground markets till it becomes legitimate ultimately just wait game for India now.. hodl on my ya fellows
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:41:09
Imagine when it will drop from 1 mill to 200 k one day��
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:02:49
Buy all bitcoins if it drops to 9.2 k in July so you can sell all of them at 87000 Kay and retire
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:42:39
Working on it..
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:36:34
Oh that’s what it’s meant for... haha... it’s coming to a theatre near you “ Bitcoin and death of fiat system-a revolution” staring our own legend Mr. Bitcoin

@_date: 2019-06-06 11:31:30
Sometimes I feel how privileged smart we bitcoiners are over these high profile people who don’t understand bitcoin and keep saying it’s going to zero and all bitcoin is doing exactly opposite over last whole decade and we are proven right time and again. I still want to give them another 10 years. In coming 10 years if bitcoin does not go to zero we all should be appointed in all these important positions cause we all saw future and are geniuses
@_date: 2019-02-01 02:33:31
You never know when halving bull run will start since people now are pretty use to the cycle.. selling btc now is like playing with fire ..6k was last chance to sell.. selling now and buying at 10 -15k when it jumps in couple hours would be disastrous investment of lifetime cause next bull run is heading straight upto 100k in couple months no chance to get in specially for noobs
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:33:24
Oh boy what would this look like when btc hits 1 mill by 2029 should age well
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:03:04
Trading btc is so kiddish now... hodl 10 years minimum and retire is the way to go..
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:18:32
Yupes . People simply don’t realize meaning of lost coins, no premine, decentralization and it’s effects on coin price... well it’s just better for me .. hope this bear market stays 3-4 years for me to accumulate maximum
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:13:39
As far as I know they can’t freeze or reverse transactions or steal your funds inflate etc etc

@_date: 2019-06-23 14:58:59
Lol why would community disagree? Human brain doesn’t work that way. When there is real threat to their money all humans will agree. Common sense to me.
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:33:49
Yea there will be no movement till it’s global currency or currency in a country at that time it won’t matter as will not be taxable and lost wallets may be found
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:53:27
Can’t agree with you enough the next real bull run will start with Bitcoin and will never crash. Only up up and above.. year 2021..: this one is fake..: I mean LTC oh come on give me a break any noob can sense that��
Manipulators now realize that it’s getting harder to manipulate btc and cryptomarket with it. They need another small cap coin to manipulate markets but they forget it’s not going to happen in the end they will start playing with btc and start pumping it the more they do this the more hodlers join and their profit margin keeps on decreasing cause it’s easy to break trust and fool noobs on small new coins than btc hodlers 
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:05:09
Lol 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:56:42
They need to kill Bitcoin.. only way to stop it...��

@_date: 2019-10-11 03:07:02
Prolly cost of that quantum computer will be more than all miners together so...
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:42:15
Hope zuck is not already shitting in his pants watching all this...he should have simply bought 70bill of bitcoin and enabled bitcoin transactions with lightning on FB and never looked back again.. thought he knew his shit... I guess not..
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:07:00
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:23:17
One of the best... people who are not smart like him should atleast listen and do what he says..
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:14:07
As you can see each and everything over last 10 years has worked out exactly has Satoshi wrote so when he says  fees will offset miner costs you have to accept it’s happening. By that time technology will also evolve to a point that you will have miners in your smart watch Satoshi was a time traveler imho 
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:16:33
That’s how it starts and that’s how poor gets poorer and rich become richer... cause poor people are ignorant and struggle for survival... so I don’t them but just trying do my bit and spread awareness provide help
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:07:35
Woh... they need to do dna teeth analysis on dead body and if true my heartfelt condolences. If false nice try for trying to attempt heist of century 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:08:25
We don’t need them just need 21 mill hodlers from 7 bill population holding 1 btc for life
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:20:57
If you look at from correct anything that affects price and growth of ecosystem community will accept or reject proposals... clearly lost coins if hacked by quantum would cause major damage to ecosystem growth and community will make changes accordingly... bitcoin is the consensus mechanism humanity has never seen before...it works perfectly every time in every aspect..
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:23:02
257k ATH and sell at 60 k okay?
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:38:10
It can be gamed...lol such a noob
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:15:01
Now how to cashout?
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:11:03
Always Linux brah..and a full node or eps... you can tunnel from anywhere in the world no problems
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:09:22
Yes saw that
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:16:30
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:30:40
I bet Supreme Court has banned terrorism drugs child labor corruption violence murder and so many other things already in India. Bitcoin is not even any of these crimes and if they ban it would be laughable to implement 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:18:53
Exactly 7.9 years to be precise

@_date: 2019-06-23 20:54:11
Prolly Satoshi got an idea from it
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:46:39
He is in Citadel
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:19:11
Enough for him to retire by 2030
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:48:42
Time to moon. All in!
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:18:02
Can’t agree on this more... I think I have better understanding of economics human psychology technology market cycles and all way better than phds since I got into bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:09:45
Chill bro .. globalcoin is going to be world currency.... on earth 200000000 ... not on this earth.. cause this earth already have one... bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-08 12:03:16
Don’t collect in bch though it’s worthless anyways
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:47:30
I think we have enough holders now that will keep on buying btc as it drops we do not need new investors. They will fomo once all holders got the coins and no more coins are in market and some user desperately needs them for some transaction that traditional system can’t do. Will start bull run and fomo. It’s just time game.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:00:06
Yupes. There will be a presidential address and news channels will run this all week so all active users are aware . No brainer to me.
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:30:26
So suddenly my node and RaspiBlitz wallet unable to receive payments tried restarting it it’s running on TOR .. able to send just not able to receive..the invoice address generated says not valid..any inputs?
@_date: 2019-02-16 11:18:21
Yupes 10 years needed. 100k or 1 million doesn’t matter still a great investment. The problem with stocks that they can even be played fractional 
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:42:32
Just hodl why sell.. in few years you will buy back since fiat will be out of use or minimal
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:38:30
Yes agree but We can still increase confirmations essentially freezing mainnet transactions till community fights back but still be functional and carry on day today life. Say 500 confirmations. They will have to sustain 51% that long to essentially have any benefits. Again closing and opening  channels would be a problem but if you already had plenty before attack you can still use it till mainnet is stabilized again. Right now it seems not so practical but once BTC becomes global people will care less to close or open channels . Only new users will need to open channels but closing won’t be needed since it’s a currency. Hope I am making it clear enough.
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:41:54
You can’t decouple from mainet simply because to confirm fixed supply at anytime mainnet is needed. Else people will inflate btc on lightning at will same as current banks so mainnet and lightning are inseparable but can be used separately 
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:09:00
Prolly you will have your own miner with wallet installed in your smart watch by then and 4 bill people running miners in some way. No country can attack that
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:11:59
Damn you guys are buying million $ pizzas just saying..

@_date: 2019-02-09 17:48:12
If that many woolens are onboard only funding channel would be needed along with big amount interbank like transactionswill settle in btc. Daily life transactions will be all lightening. Closing channels would not be needed if btc is global currency

The same guy who is billionaire due to internet said internet would be worthless in 1998 what an irony and shame to him and he didn’t learn from it
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:39:33
Yea once people realize it’s inevitable they will buy btc and only sell for living expenses so net movement will be upwards only right now people are still confused about its security speed etc which in my opinion not a concern at all.  Just buckle up hodl buy as much btc now and retire by 2027 max
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:30:58

Yes bitcoin is a way to crimeless world all crimes are related to money in someway so govts are ready to adopt bitcoin to control crime for good since they can’t track dollar bills but bitcoin they are just waiting for tech to mature then there will be Rush of all govts to adopt it.... human civilization can’t survive without law and order and bitcoin is next evolution in money to control crime..a weapon..people who think completely anonymous currencies will be future are delusional ... if that happens there will be utter keyoss with inflated crime... bitcoin is just a perfect mix provides just enough privacy for day to day use which is legal but if people try to use it for crime law and order can track and control crime..time to moon

Spoofing is an illegal form of market manipulation in which a trader places a large order to buy or sell a financial asset, such as a stock, bond or futures contract, with no intention of executing. By doing so, the trader—or "the spoofer"—creates an artificial impression of high demand for the asset.

Yes zap is on my own node . WOS is for testing. Best is run your own node and wallet. But common joe who likes banks can still use WOS which still 1000 times better than banks. They can even restore lost account for you or in future give you fraud protection etc but most importantly can’t inflate money at Will.

Any wallet without your fullnode or personal server is susceptible to all drawbacks mentioned. Electrum is time trusted wallet and you can run with EPS. It has great interface no one lost any coins if they are careful
The only way to escape all drawbacks you mentioned is running your full node

The service goes down when coinbase or mycelium is ddosed - that’s the key here we don’t  want that . With electrum it can’t never happen.. sure you can get denial or hard time connecting but you switch to manual or start running your own server and be back online and I agree it’s easy to ddos public than private servers but not impossible. I would rather run my full node and server and use my personal server rather than using third party private servers so still electrum wins for me. Have used it last 4 years even during this ongoing ddos never a problem

I get your point but what happens when all private trusted servers are ddosed? Like I said it’s all about awareness and with easy one click you change settings to manual and use trusted nodes. It’s important to have flexibility in a wallet being able to connect to any nodes that’s a whole point of decentralization. With only selected few private servers you still give your information to them and if they exist scam or go down your information or coins are lost anyways. And first rule of crypto is dyor don’t download anything except trusted sites without verifying pgp signatures

You have not answered my question why private servers can’t be ddosed? In fact if you only have limited servers for a wallet and they get ddosed or out of service or clogged you are screwed,  with ability to connect any servers you can anytime switch servers manually and still be good with all this , this is the biggest metric I vouch for with electrum

BTC has and will always be no1 for this simple reason ... even without scaling and even with so called 2000 other scaling techs BTC has survived and will always... it’s been a journey of a decade.. past is proof of what true hodlers are here for...BTC will scale with lightning and second layer first may be slowly with blocksize when hardware tech advances to run big blocks size cheaply for a common joe

People simply don’t understand onchain payments will only go high if people themselves are willing to pay that high to be in priority. If it’s not you someone else is paying that high fees. If no one wants to pay that high fee it will come down. People are willing to pay high fees only proves how valuable this service is to them.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:22:24
That time was for 2 months. Rest 9 years 10 months fees were all time low and you can still run a node even with ATH fees..... even if btc hits 1 mill the fees will not remain ATH for long once market cools down.. its natural for fees to go higher during bull run peaks... but normalizes after cool off.. and like I said when hardware tech goes cheaper onchain scaling will happen

Lol I am not being defensive just trying to understand your point. And you haven’t answered what happens when private servers go down or ddosed. Your coins stuck in wallet right. I do not still believe that electrum is at fault here it’s the users. And it can still happen to any wallets. You can easily change server settings to manual and connect to private or trusted server via electrum. It’s all about awareness not design . Electrum is probably the safest and trusted wallet ever for bitcoin

Lovely. Nice to meet you.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:09:28
So let’s rewind for you.. the year is 2009-10 a tech called btc is released... 10 people mostly tech nerds adopted it.. people are laughing at it... one guy just bought a 10000 btc pizza for fun..... I said if we get 5.8 million users one day price of 1 btc may reach upto 20k...see any ifs and mays here?
And dude your logic that btc won’t be enough for all the money in the world is totally flawed.. you need to read white paper and go through bitcoin forums to understand what’s M1 supply and why satoshi chose total coins and Satoshis you are way behind your game at this point
And deflationary currencies are way better than our traditional fiat cause you know that they don’t work as seen from periodic recessions... so either way deflationary currencies are way better to use once mass adopted..
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:08:39
Not really.. that was you taking bla bla��
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:19:20
Haha it’s good for us that some people think like you..cause once this game has been played out we want you guys to use BTC as money and not hodl it like we are doing right now...
If a technology is there which is superior to what we are doing right now it is going to make roads in your day today life sooner or later...that’s a fact and you can’t deny it you have many examples right from internet to smartphones
And I agree till 5.8 million becomes 5.8 billion BTC won’t be stable enough to be used as day to day currency 
if you study market cycles it correlates  with adoption. You have seen  how stable BTC is now or was at 6k for few months that’s the time people should and will spend it for day today use and this time where btc stays stable after a market cycle will keep on increasing... so say btc stays stable for 10 years during next market cycle..people will use it as money during that time..:
And I agree who will spend a coin at this stage which is going to become 1 mill .. not me...
But as adoption keeps on increasing the early adopters who are way in profits say 10 times won’t mind spending btc for day to day transactions....
The key to mass adoption in my opinion at this stage is mass education of what this tech is and not usage... once we have sufficient people adopting it we can start using it as a global currency.
it’s been here for last 10 years with no glitch no downtime.... world is watching this very very closely right now... once a major state adopts it...rest is going to be history..

@_date: 2019-01-22 12:48:22
Yea you know EOS went from nothing to number 5 without mainnet and now what?Did that tell you something? And lightning is layer 2 on most decentralized crypto.

With added benefits of opening channels with whom you have recurring transactions which would in my opinion is a huge benefit cause it would be zero fees instant transactions. We all pay electricity, gas water or employer pay employee monthly even we shop from same Walmart most of the times. So once you open channel with them and find with them appropriately it’s done deal for life saving tons of fees and time.

Cardano is all pep talk.. EOS which launched recently is miles ahead of cardano... with this speed cardano can’t survive this cutthroat competition . Lisk horizon ? Well if top marketcap coins cant compete with lightening forget about this low cap so called projects as money stimulates development. Low money involved= low development

@_date: 2019-01-27 12:40:45
You are missing the whole game here... lightening will result in mass adoption increasing btc demand resulting in BTC mooning to say 1 million... at that point a miner won’t care if he makes money from transaction.. block reward of even .5 btc would be enough.... now when all btcs would be mined by 2145 which is a long time and if everyone adopts btc by that time I believe all govts , banks would run their miners just to enhance security and not for profits because their business will be dependent on this global monetary transaction system and economic pillar.. now you are thinking why banks will survive.. because their are lazy people who don’t want to take risk to keep keys etc so banks would be mainly custodial something like coinbase...
This is a big game my friend..2145 is way long time and we won’t be there to see all that unfortunately but this is how it is going to play..

Yea heard people fleeing  abroad with billions borrowed from Indian banks by bribing corrupt officials also recently had demonetization episode which actually should be demonetization to Bitcoin. I think Indian people should realize its high time and they should be first to buy bitcoin it’s there best shot of surviving all this. If you can’t use your own money the way you want , that’s a shame. I mean bitcoin is not a drug or weapon of mass destruction. Why it should be illegal. It’s just a rat poison squared for banks and corrupt officials.. Be smart Indians.. you guys are and you can do better than this..

Lightning is maturing not usable for common person yet may take 3-5 years but if you are above grade 8 then can fire your own Raspi or casa node and start using lightning instantly. Let me know if you need any help with that.
If I told you to buy modem or router when internet started you would have probably not done that or laughed at me and I expect the same and would not be offended.
But as humans we should learn quick from our past .

Nano is nonexistent imho after the bitgrail hack not secure. EOS or ether may have a chance if dapps don’t happen on lightning which is unlikely . 
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:45:30
Most alts are for speed those will be gone.. they can’t match lightning..remaining one for dapps I am not sure as there as already talks of dapps on BTC second layer combined with lightening. Privacy ones like monero also not relevant with lightning enabled privacy.. but dyor just that’s my view

Most people enter bitcoin for quick money without reading the white paper that’s why these market cycles.. with every market cycle bitcoin keeps on getting true hodlers meaning who read white paper understanding tech ,science, real use, purpose  who invest what they can afford to loose probably won’t sell bitcoin at any cost.. Once this number reaches 21 million I.e. .0.2% of world population the price of 1 bitcoin would be infinite..it may take 10-20 market cycles to reach there but at some point it will happen as 0.2% is simply nothing.. and I am not even considering lost bitcoins..there are way more lottery believers than that in the world

@_date: 2019-01-06 23:53:26
I know and it’s never going to happen cause would be waste of resources for a state rather they would try to kill it by creating fear among people which may delay the adoption but its going to happen eventually 
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:59:59
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:37:09
Same is true for any other blockchain.. even the fastest EOS has CPU RAM issues.. so 1.5 billion in first 10 years then next 1.5 billion in next 10 years and so on.. don’t expect complete adoption in 1 year.. it 20 years for internet.. May be same or more for BTC
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:34:55

If this really happened... I would simply say someone simply unlocked your phone and got the pic rather than gmail. People worldwide save way more valuable information on their gmail than 1.3 btc imho. If it was that easy to get information from gmail by hacking it would not have existed as faang.

Not reli. If your hardware up (brain) is empty no wallet can protect your fund. This phishing is going on for 6-7 months. If you can’t dyor all the time that’s okay. Just atleast follow basic rules.Electrum is safest of all and better than any hardware wallets
1. Use Linux.
2. Download from electrum.org yeah type ‘electrum.org’ manually and never install anything from anywhere or upgrade.
3. Run your own node or eps- bitcoin is bitcoin because yes you can run your own node even on a raspi thats why it’s safest if all crypto. No other
If you really wanna fuck hackers- run your node, eps, tunnel via ssh and use Linux - all this on crypto exclusive machine on which there is no other program or porn

I liked when they wrote bitcoin is a scam.... so what is fiat? People decided to give value to ink and paper and govts fooling billions with that paper and ink? Does ink and paper have intrinsic value of 10000$ for 100 , 100$ bills.. think about it ...it’s people who are willing to give value to that paper... we are are greater fools with fiat... not with bitcoin ...bitcoins intrinsic value comes from its scarcity and portability... ease of transaction... bitcoin has intrinsic value not fiat

After 2140 mining rewards will be sats... so say 21 million sats remaining at the end of 2140 after 99.99% bitcoins are mined ..then rewards will be in sats follow same halving.. when sats are done microsats... thennano sats and so on... in this way rewardsnever end.... the price keeps mooning so at some point one nano sat will be 10 k today and so on.. this is the hidden Satoshi code people are not ready to see yet since they only look at bitcoin as a whole but the way Satoshi deaigned it with halving 100% bitcoins will never be mined and decimals will be easily added with softfork and value keeps on increasing as humanity keeps to live on..

If block size would have increased that  one billion transaction would have been reorged multiple times by only one or two miners till the sender pays ransom cause increasing block size has caused centralization of bch already and you have seen the recent easy pisy reorg by bch for 3.6 k something bch which is like 0.5 million. Imagine miners saw 1 billion transaction on bch. They would ransom the shit out of sender of that transaction lol. Take your bch coolaid somewhere else man. World is not dumb as you think.

Simple economics and market dynamics tells be an asset can’t be stable until its mass adopted and trusted. 20 years of bitcoin existence would be an unremarkable phenomenon engraving trust in people . It will still be volatile but only upwards.. and when 100% adoption it becomes stable as gold

@_date: 2019-09-10 18:33:50
RBF is not reorg. When you have 1 billion in a single transaction you need highest fees possible to get it in next block like they did recently for transactions to be secured soon. It’s other way round actually without rbf people can start thinking of double spend if it doesn’t go through next block by doing 51%

Simply use core as node on Linux connect electrum to it. If you can keep it running you can connect your electrumwallet worldwide directly to your node via SSH installing eps. A little techy but a fun project. I am no tech guy I am into accounting but took me 2-3 hours to set it up in an old laptop. Instructions are all on GitHub. Let me know if you need help.

That’s what happens when you make changes without vetting properly that’s why bitcoin is a winner in all aspects.. when it comes to my money I want better safe than sorry that’s how every human should be for their hard earned money.. don’t be a fool carried away by scaling and transaction fees and all that crap.. I would anytime spend 3$ to transact 8k over loosing it all over a centralized coin like bch.. with time scaling will happen on layer one on btc when hardware tech evolves to a point you can run  10/100 mb blocks on raspi node.. be patient it’s your money.. your hard earned money don’t gamble be safe

Wrong ... it rises because number of hodlers of last resort keeps on increasing who understands economics and fundamentals of bitcoin... once it reaches to a certain number you won’t be able to buy a full bitcoin ever

I love this idea of bitcoin bills but how to trust the maker of these bills that they didn’t save other copy of private keys hidden in these bills.. someone needs to come up an idea of hiding this private keys without creators knowldege . With an nfs funds can be confirmed and once you scratch and expose the private keys on this bills then the bill becomes useless...no need to transact on main layer just transfer the bills like we do now.. 0 transaction fees wow

It was a coiled spring for last whole year.. exchanges and whales trying to make most of it and I get it.. they deserve maximum benefits to bring bitcoin to what bitcoin is today.. as a hodler it doesn’t bother me cause in the end all hodlers win.. noobs and get rich lose it and I don’t feel sorry for them since if they don’t know how to respect bitcoin they are not needed

Also 51% attack can’t kill bitcoin... only temporarily affect onchain transactions till community fights back... lightning payments will be unaffected if you already have opened channels.. you can close channels once 51% is over... hence anyone doing 51% will lose money over attack as prices won’t crash much may be 100 bucks

Well when hashrate and adoption riches to a point where fees and wait times  are on the rise killing the project ... miners have more incentive at that point to kill RBF hard to sell at this point but when incentives align some time in future this can still be done. Again miners can still bunch up and do51% today but they are not cause incentives don’t align same holds true for RBF . If project starts dying they lose incentive they will accept it... I agree lightning can do this but still not fully developed

CZ is just delusional and in disbelief after his hack news could not crash bitcoin. This is his another smart way of trying to undermine the bitcoin protocol because this is the only way bitcoin can go down and his shitcoin nano or bnb can have some hope..

How noobs you guys are!  an exchange hack is always an insider job.. right from mt gox to binance... why do you think the exchanges in US like conbase never gets hacked and only overseas exchanges always? Has anyone thought on this yet? Cause laws are strict in US and FBI is still a big deal no one wants to mess with them..
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:39:10
Does dollar have value?...just because govts say so ...lol.. it’s paper with no one knows how many have been printed and has no intrinsic value it’s paper..and it’s just people who believe it has value...bitcoin is the hardest pure money and SOV mankind has ever invented and each and every Satoshi is accounted for.. can you do that for every dollar in existence? Dollar and all fiat people are living upto so many years and high time they realize this...people will eventually wake upto this...it’s a slow process... but it’s happening... bitcoin has become the most expensive currency over 10 years by comparison to $ starting from zero..One day it will have the most marketcap among all currencies in the world..

Oh wow litecoin... seriously ... that’s a scam an outright scam.. and when it comes to money people will always trust the most secure one.. when a wheel is invented you don’t invent another triangular or square wheel you improve on the same wheel to build car.. that’s where lightning and other layer 2 solutions are going to do to other alts.. and you will at that time remember why Charlie sold all his litecoins ATH..
Here is how btc is superior and will stay like that it’s a domino phenomenon unbreakable
most profitable for mining will always be BTC
Most decentralized will always be BTC
Most secure will always be BTC
Best halving deflation total supply with lost coins will always be BTC
And smart people who know value of these 4 will always keep getting sucked into BTC sooner or later and domino effect keeps getting bigger..
BTC will always be BTC

The whole idea of all this 10 years is to change people’s perception same as dollar bill that it has value to BTC and it’s working. We accept dollar bills because we are equal fools not greater since it’s valued doesn’t change once all people on earth realize btc is same as dollar bill and start accepting it without conversion to fiat that’s what would be endpoint if all this and it may take minimum 15 years

@_date: 2018-12-05 11:50:00
Bitcoin was secure even when it had 1/10th of hashpower of today’s years ago. If you have that much of hashpower to attack bitcoin you may simply wanna make money mining it rather than reversing few transactions and wasting your money unless you are a state who intentionally wants to bring it down.  It would  start a civil war if any state tries to do that on a 100 billion industry. Also once the attack would be over it will rise back again as bitcoin is that Jennie which has come out of bottle and there is no stopping it. People have invested money and time in it that too billions in mining equipments and other resources there is only one way it can go from here on long term... up!
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:44:44
Everyone misses the point here if you simply buy and hodl btc it’s price will keep on rising Nd businesses will start accepting it as currency I mean I would if someone pays me in btc for a coffee and next day that btc doubles
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:06:44

Doesn’t change a thing,. Run a core wallet or EPS and you can coo extra from anywhere in the world with ssh tunnel... if anyone is into crypto these are basics.. with big power comes great responsibility..old saying but stands true everywhere... bitcoin is power no one had before... be responsible
