Millions of dollars back then could make a difference...now you need billions to make difference.

Of course it is, it was a Ponzi scheme all along they made money and hid away for a bit...last few fighting over the scraps..when it really is the end people will be in shock at what just happened...�� Get ready for that one last big sell off...then they just walk away not run just walk just to rub salt in the wound.

Well they just mine millions of different coins..use other people’s electricity and owe rent on buildings and just send the coins to themselves then declare bankruptcy.. they ain’t silly.

Those small fish those people you called millennials... made no difference, the big fish took the money and hid for a bit waiting for more small fish to buy in until the last big sell off where they clean up and walk away.
