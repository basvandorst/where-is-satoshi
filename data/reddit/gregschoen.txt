I figure someone had to have sold me that BTC @ $0.06 so someone's got it worse than me :)

Geez, this tweet is making its way everywhere. (Yup that's my tweet)
Couple of things that've come up that I'll try to answer:
I really don't get why people think I would have killed myself over this whole bitcoin thing. There's literally no amount of money that Bitcoin could go to that would justify that. There are worse things that can happen in your life than selling something too early and if something like this is the worst thing that ever happens to you in your life, consider yourself really lucky.
Money is just money, a means to an end. Does it sting that I could have had an insane amount of money? Sure. Does it keep me up at night? Not at all, mostly it just makes me feel a bit stupid for not understanding what I was seeing at the time to hold, even before HODL was a meme. Seriously, I looked it up and HODL's from a December 18, 2013 Bitcoin Talk Forums post.
Am I doing alright? Yeah, mostly because I have a decent job.
Do I hold crypto? Really small amounts of some low market cap coins with technology that I like. The bulk of what I had remaining from playing with crypto early on got sold recently to pay off my student loans and credit cards. Not the payday that others have gotten, but it's had a positive effect on my life, I'm sure my credit is going to improve once it all registers. Now I mostly keep up to date with crypto to see what's going on and if there are any new interesting coins with cool technology. But I'm not throwing much money at it, nor do I really intend to.
To be honest I didn't get into crypto to make some huge payday, I don't think many of us did that early. It was a new technology to play around with, something we'd never really seen before. So we dropped a hundred bucks on Mt.Gox and did some trading, trying to see how it all worked. Traded to paper wallets, sweeped them into online wallets, sent them to friends, bought pizzas, played SatoshiDice. I didn't recognize what it all meant until much, much later.
Do I remember what I spent it on? The $0.30 sell wasn't the last of my trades, I think I made like $1k once I did finally pull the bulk of my account out of Mt.Gox into my bank account, it probably went to rent or other random purchases. I was mostly happy I came out ahead.

Ehh, paper wallets are pretty damn safe. If you grab the github js from the paper wallet site and do it on an offline computer, you're pretty well golden.
I once did a proof of concept to scan the blockchain for brain wallets using the XKCD method, but there's a stupid amount of permutation, even with 100 word dictionary x 4 words. A brain wallet is another decent way to go, if you've got good words to use. Though there are a ton of transactions in the "correct horse battery staple" brain wallet.

Not as a speculator, since I'm not sure how much more 1000x price fluctuations there's going to be. But I've been wrong in the past. :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:21:34
I definitely wouldn't sell all of it, that's for sure :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:48:22
Yeah, that's kinda my thought process too. Figure I hold on for a few more years.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:20:04
Thanks! I mean I look at it like, I'm not down money and I didn't mortgage a house to buy in at $19,000 and then panic sell at $13,000. I'm sure way more people have it worse than me, there are probably dozens of stories like mine or worse, I just happened to tweet about it in 2011 with a  hashtag.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:26:39
Heh, this reddit account is 7 years old, not my main one.
I've long since made peace with it, I was annoyed at $200, now it's just a story.

@_date: 2017-12-28 02:16:20
I might have to do that, I'm more or less answering questions in here right now, but this isn't my main Reddit account.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:16:07
Ahh so sorta like Reddcoin's Proof of Stake, I think I read Etherium was going to do something like that with Staking in the future, but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:59:23
I bought and sold at a bunch of prices, honestly not holding too much anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:06:20
I'm doing alright, but not "25 million dollars" alright, you know?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:59:36
If I'm being honest, I was expecting it to dip and I was gonna buy back in, I did much later of course. I've got some old SatoshiDice transactions that really sting. Bets of like 10BTC that were like $30 at the time and could buy a house with cash today.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:14:35
Noted for possible future time travel.

I've not heard much about NEO, looks from the announcement to be somewhat ETH-inspired?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:12:28
I was still in during the time between but I didn't have a bunch of crypto people following me so there wasn't much of a reason to tweet about it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:58:45
Nah, sadly. I wish I'd dumped a few dozen into a cold wallet and lost it until last month. I was going through some of my old machines on the lookout for wallet.dat files though.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:46:40
Oh, I see what you did there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:54:00
It's a story now, I only think about it when numerous people on Twitter mention me to tell me how much I would have when bitcoin goes up :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:23:12
Paper wallets are a good route to go as well, print it out and put it in a safety deposit box, so you have the extra work of needing to sweep the coins AND get to the bank during business hours.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:07:26
Heh, I remember doing pool mining with a straight up CPU and making like 2BTC, those were the days.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:42:44
I'm pretty bullish on ETH, bought a couple at $12 and I swear I'm never selling, for some reason that's not worked out for me in the past... ARDR is the most recent coin I've been meaning to take a deep look into, but from what I've heard it's got some interesting features.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:29:10
To be real honest, once this huge spike happened, I pretty much sold the bulk of what I had left to pay off my student loans and my credit cards.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:33:34
LOL yeah, thankfully I only had about 0.8 in MtGox when it hit the fan, I do have the honor of having a sub 500 id entry in the leaked password database.
All my old hard drives were completely clear of any old wallet.dat files, I made extra sure before I wiped and donated them.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:17:59
I know that feeling, "Why didn't I just forget about this account until right this moment?" My blockchain.info has transactions from back in like 2012 or something and there's some stuff like that in there.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:49:30
*&lt;echo voice&gt;* Never sell 100%, at least hold a reserve of a few percent in a cold wallet.
