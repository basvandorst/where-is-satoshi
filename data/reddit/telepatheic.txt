Well MtGox customers are creditors so they will have to repay as many customers as they can. The caveats are that it isn't known how bitcoin deposits will be treated. I guess they will be treated like a commodity so the liquidaters will probably auction off all the bitcoin they do hold and customers will be paid back in yen in proportion to their holdings on MtGox depending on how much money the business can find.

1. You are correct but huge amounts of real world interactions do not involve me giving out my name address and age, most interactions are completely pseudonymous. Also many websites display user information publicly without the explicit consent of the user. Anybody can search for "telepatheic" and view the services that I use (except I only use the username telepatheic on reddit so people can't do this). 
3. Why would payments be fragmented? I have a bitcoin wallet which has hundreds of addresses and nobody, not even the bitcoin protocol knows that those addresses belong to the same wallet. It would be easy to write a similar program to manage multiple identities in an identity wallet.
5. How does the wallet connect to the internet? My bitcoin wallet is just an encrypted file on a memory stick. Or does this wallet actually look nothing like a bitcoin wallet?
6. Content can't be guaranteed to come from a certain time period google thinks all these [pieces of content about bitcoin]( come from 2007 which is clearly wrong.

Whilst I support Maidsafe I would advise people not to buy safecoins. They are an **extremely risky investment** because they are implemented on top of the mastercoin network and this will be the first usable "smart property" on the mastercoin network. Whilst "smart property" [has been tested]( the testing has only just started.
Please note that mastercoin does not work like other forms of cryptocurrency, **no consensus is formed when using mastercoin**. All transactions whether valid or invalid are accepted into the bitcoin blocks (assuming they are valid bitcoin transactions) and mastercoin clients try to interpret the data in the way they believe is best. This means different clients may see which transactions are valid and which aren't differently to each other. Assuming everyone uses the reference clients everything should be fine but you should take extra care to avoid people double spending. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:26:22
It isn't possible for two reasons. The transactions inputs must all have been included in the blockchain before (although theoretically you can get around this by including both transactions in the same block, the rules about whether this would make it a valid transaction are unclear).
The second reason is less obvious but more difficult to get around. To refer to the first transaction you need the hash of the first transaction, but the first transaction needs the hash of the second transaction and so on...
Theoretically there exists ways of breaking this loop but none are computationally feasible (if they do become computationally feasible, many parts of bitcoin will become insecure).

Nick Szabo almost certainly isn't Satoshi. Here is my reasoning:
- Juola &amp; Associates, (text analysis experts) have ruled out that Szabo could be Satoshi according to [this forbes article](
- My fairly amateur analysis of their punctuation on [Szabo's blog]( and [Staoshi's forum posts]( Satoshi always places the period inside the parentheses ".)" when he places a whole sentences inside them whereas Szabo places it outside ")." The number of instances of this occurring is unfortunately too low to be conclusive.
- Whilst [Szabo has a degree in computer science from Washington University]( there is no evidence of him producing any C++ code. [Szabo's code commenting style]( is very different from Satoshi's.
- Satoshi said very little in the way of expressing political and cultural views whereas Szabo had done [extensive research into the history of money](
- Satoshi reckoned [micropayments were possible with bitcoin]( whereas Szabo argued that they [require too much mental calculation to be feasible](
- Satoshi stated ["I'm better with code than with words though."]( whereas Szabo is clearly [very good with words](

Bitcoin makes no real advance in terms of security or trustworthiness of voting.  We already have cryptographically secure schemes but there are always considerable challenges making these systems work in the real world. For example if you have a one person, one vote system then you have to have a way of distributing the votes without giving more or less than one vote to every individual. This is incredibly difficult.
Here are some resources:

This is a legal grey area. Few governments have defined what rights people can lay claim to when dealing with virtual assets. 
Its something that governments have not yet realised. It is all well and good producing legislation for tax and for anti-money-laundering but there is very little law surrounding ownership of virtual assets. Stealing bitcoin for example is still a grey area, in most cases bitcoin is stolen when accessing contents of another computer system which is covered under existing computer misuse acts but what about using a cluster to crack brain-wallets is that theft? What about photographing private keys on paper wallets, is that theft?

Yes .0001 is the lowest fee that is recognised as being acceptable. You can make your own custom transactions with lower fees if you prefer but they might take longer to get included in a block.

It's a satisfactory method but not hugely secure. Firstly you should always uses SSL  otherwise people can find out what random numbers you are receiving from the website. Secondly the site may get hacked and replaced with code which isn't very random.

No, when you generate a private key you want to generate it such that nobody else is able to guess what you generated. This means you use a random number generator (RNG) to produce the key. A lot of effort goes into the design of these RNGs such that no two people will ever produce the same keys even if they produced billions and billions of them.
As an aside, cryptography often fails due to poorly coded RNGs, there was a problem last year with [android phones] ( failing to be truly random and some bitcoin was stolen. Also, the NSA is alleged to have put a backdoor in one [RNG]( thankfully it isn't used by bitcoin implementations.

Your research is going to be highly biased unless you are very careful with the way you collect your data. Certain types of merchants in certain geographic location will have a higher proportion of bitcoin paying customers. Also merchants obviously like bitcoin as a payment method otherwise they wouldn't have implemented it so you won't get much data from asking them their preference.
A better experiment would be to go to several merchants in your home town that don't accept bitcoin and set them up with bitcoin. You can then measure how bitcoin is used and get a less biased view of how the merchant feels about bitcoin. If possible you should have a control group, for example set up another group of merchants with google wallet. That way you have something to compare bitcoin against.
Anyway pick up the phone and start calling merchants. There are literally thousands advertising on the internet and the vast majority have some form of contact details and would probably be willing to help you out.

I thought he explained it OK. He should have gone into a bit more detail but that's difficult without the sue of diagrams. 
You could also pick him up for saying transactions are sent to peoples addresses, that's not accurate. To make a transaction you must be able to satisfy the output of a previous transaction with the input of the transaction you are creating. That criteria is in most cases a public key that, when hashed, yields the output address of a previous transaction and a signed version of a previous transaction to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the public key just provided. Other criteria require multiple signatures or even no signatures.
But that's quite long handed so most people just use the send to address analogy.

He also uses american spelling like -ization rather than the English -isation and writes english as a native speaker would.
The paper he wrote on bitcoin was published using OpenOffice 2.4 on letter sized paper (8.5x11 inches) again suggesting he is from North America.

Good question, in short you would have to rely on a trusted third party such as a government to certify that a person passed away. The big problem with smart contracts is getting them to interact with the real world in a trusted and reliable way.

I think you are correct. You can read the technical details [here]( Essentially You have a passcode, from this you generate an intermediate code. You send the intermediate code to the maker of the wallet card. They use it to generate a public key and an encrypted private key. Using the whole passcode the user can decrypt the private key. In this way the maker of the wallet card doesn't know the private key.

Here's a counter example. I go to a pub in England. I try to pay with a £50 note (bill), they don't like £50 notes because the banks don't issue them from ATMs, they refuse to accept my money. So I have two choices. I could give them a £5 note or I could pay with bitcoins.
To pay with bitcoins I have to ask to pay in bitcoins, I have to take the printed QR code, make sure it is lying on a flat surface, type in a pin to open my phone, open my wallet app, enter another pin, press to start a new payment, position the QR code and camera such that the light isn't obscured by the camera, wait for the camera to focus and finally press to accept the transaction.
That's a lot of hassle and I could just take a £5 note out of my wallet and hold out my hand for some change. At the moment the economic incentives for the person paying means they would rather pay in cash than with bitcoins.
Moral of the story, carry small notes with you and work needs to be done on improving the bitcoin experience such that the effort for the customer is minimal.

The change to the block size limit is major but it doesn't require much work to implement (change of a constant in the source code).

I'm sorry but I disagree. Whilst the FT is probably one of the best papers it still produces poor journalism. Firstly they mention MtGox in the first line when it isn't relevant to taxation.
Secondly, the news isn't new. The meeting was held last week and discussions have been ongoing since at least December, there was a strong likelihood of a change of position back in [January](
Furthermore HMRC never issued any guidance to say that VAT should be paid on bitcoins they merely said that they [intended to issue guidance]( that bitcoin should be classified as a voucher. HMRC has to date not issued any guidance regarding the tax status of bitcoin.
Thirdly "Some Bitcoin users see the UK as a more favourable jurisdiction in wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the US government spying on the internet" well that means absolutely nothing and is simply speculation.
The journalism is of mediocre quality. It's not really poor like most stories on bitcoin in the popular press but it is not of the same standard as the FT a couple of decades ago.

The problem is organising a political strategy is difficult. bitcoiners believe in different political ideas. Already we are seeing the divide between those who are more libertarian and those who who are more socialist. The concerns of some in the community are the benefits to others.
Bitcoin will evolve in it's own way but trying to influence this process will be quite difficult, it depends on the politics of those joining the bitcoin community. More people are joining bitcoin for its practical points rather than the politics and its likely that bitcoin will swing more towards fitting in with the existing structures we have in the world today.
For the earlier, more political adopters, there will definitely be frustration and the next generation of cryptocoins will likely be designed to include more assertive political statements.

That is correct if you compare it to most currencies. Most currencies have inflation or deflation of about 1-10% per year. Bitcoin has had typical inflation and deflation of 1-10% *per day*. 


Correct, collective delusion is what gives diamonds, gold, paper money and bitcoin value. They are not backed by anything at all except the fact that other people believe they have value.

In terms of proof of stake, I'm not entirely sure it is feasible either. [This paper]( suggests that it isn't (Although I haven't verified the assumptions the author makes).
I'm not arguing bitcoin doesn't have value. I'm arguing that bitcoins do have value and have to have value for bitcoin to work.

When you build the secret blockchain you can do so using any transactions which have been broadcast. If you are in control of the chain you can choose which transactions to include and which not to include. You include all the transactions which transfer coins to you and ignore transactions where you were giving coins to someone else.
As long as all the transactions are based on a valid path back to coin generation transactions everything works. Performing such an attack is not trivial but it is possible.

In my opinion both Bitpay and Coinbase have taken on more than they can chew. I hear complaints about them all the time not being able to organise refunds, not providing good customer support and people simply having orders disappear. Even if 99% of transactions go smoothly, loosing all your money 1% of the time is less than ideal.
Both companies need to invest in more robust systems for working out when customers have made incorrect payments, They need to invest in a much larger customer support department and better tools for merchants to allow refunds.

I simplified the attack to make it seem more plausible and more difficult. In reality, not all coin-age is spent on mining blocks, most is actually used up in regular transactions. This means you only need 5-20% of the coins to make the attack work.
One can also buy then sell, then buy again as long as the coins that are bought second time around are not linked in the block chain to the coins which were sold. This means that with careful calculation and a large pool of liquidity, you can work your way up to 70% holdings in your secret chain without ever actually owning more than a few percent of the coins in the main chain. In fact you don't even need to buy the coins outright, you just need to have control of them at some point, this could be through a front such as a gambling site or an exchange.

One of the main problems with bitcoin right now is that there is an inability to make any big changes. Everyone has different views and opinions, the only way to continue without people complaining is to make no new changes. To answer your questions.
What exactly is bitcoin?
It is defined by the consensus of miners on the blockchain and more loosely by how the standard clients interact. Beyond that you can make bitcoin what you want it to be. Software can't define bitcoin as a currency or payment system. Humans choose to interpret it in that way and can interpret it however they like. 
How bitcoin should be implemented?
As it currently is, changes will be difficult to make, you can implement something different but it won't be bitcoin, it will be an altcoin.
Who should be our spokesperson?
No person can be a spokesperson because that would imply centralisation. Everyone can interpret bitcoin how they like and choose to worship their own spokesperson.
What system we should have in place to make broader decisions within the community?
The consensus of the miners and the bitcoin clients is the only decision process bitcoin has. The community around bitcoin can do what it likes and can choose its own method of decision making but these decisions won't fundamentally affect the core bitcoin protocol.

By altcoin I meant things like ethereum, mastercoin, nxt etc. I'm not sure why these decentralised applications have to have tokens though. For example I've got some ideas related to a peer to peer, cryptographically secured social network. The incentive to transfer and store data is not because you can obtain some coin but rather so other people are able to connect to you easily and so you can connect to others.
I'm also not sure whether this type of application is well suited to a hackathon. Hackathons are usually all about implementing an idea in a limited amount of time, whereas with a project of this scope anyone can quite easily implement the idea but it is only useful if it can work in the real world. The projects need to be secure against attacks, have the correct economic incentives to ensure they are economically viable to use and be scalable.
Satoshi thought about all these issues for a [long time before building Bitcoin]( It was solving them that secured Bitcoin's future not the actual implementation of the Bitcoin client.
I'm still thinking about problems I'm coming up against in my simulations of a peer to peer social network. There are some difficult problems regarding network discovery and search scalability that I'm having. I'm not going to solve those problems with a hackathon or lots of money. I will solve those issues by speaking to other developers and reading mathematical papers about networks. They may not even be mathematically solvable.

The time measurement used to calculate difficulty is based on the timestamps included in the block headers (not the actual time). Blocks are rejected if they report a time which is too far out of sync with the real time (I believe it is rejected if it is more than 1 hour out). Most miners try to stay in sync with the real network time so their blocks aren't rejected.

Your blog post is great. Answering "What exactly is a Bitcoin?" is difficult. I would say its just a unit of account used by the bitcoin network. What you own is the key which allows you to make a transaction of that bitcoin to somebody else.
In terms of the book, it depends on whether you want it to be a snapshot of the current state of the bitcoin economy (which is likely to become outdated very quickly) or whether you want to talk more about the technology and how it is generally helping people solve different problems. I would personally be more interested in the latter.

How will you make it be always worth $1? Will you guarantee that if they send you a coin they will get $1 in return and if they send you $1 they get 1 coin in return. This simply isn't possible with a currency which is decentralized because to guarantee that if you send  $1 you get 1 coin in return you need to be able to make that coin and that means you have more power than everyone else.
Having said that there are schemes which are not decentralized which are in many ways better than bitcoin like [droplet]( in the UK.

The generals use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever plan he hears first, he sets his computer to solve a difficult hash-based proof-of-work problem that includes the plan in its hash. The proof-of-work is difficult enough that with all of them working at once, it's expected to take 10 minutes before one of them finds a solution and broadcasts it to the network. Once received, everyone adjusts the hash in their proof-of-work computation to include the first solution, so that when they find the next proof-of-work, it chains after the first one. If anyone was working on a different plan, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.
After about two hours, the plan should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce in the allotted time. At the least, most of them had to have seen the plan, since the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.

It would be great if everyone using bitcoin just CPU mined, the problem is that someone might decide to use a GPU, so to prevent that person from getting an unequal share in the market, everyone starts buying GPUs. Computational power then escalates like an arms race, this escalation actually centralises the network around those people who can make mining chips.

It works very well, the BIP38 encryption took around 20secs which is acceptable. I have a few suggestions:
I would change the disclaimer "For extra security, do not run this generator directly from the bitcoinpaperwallet.com website. Download the generator and run the HTML as a local file in your browser instead." to "For extra security, do not run this generator directly from the bitcoinpaperwallet.com website. Download the generator, disconnect from the internet and run the HTML as a local file in your browser instead." If you are still connected to the internet it doesn't improve your security.
Secondly I would add a skip button so people can skip the mouse moving/character typing if they want a brain wallet or a wallet based on dice rolling.
Finally I'm not sure your explanation about dice rolling or card shuffling is that clear, you might want to explain why 31 cards and why 62 dice rolls, maybe explain that you can do more dice rolls if you want.

Ok, it's more complicated than I thought, it's going to take a while to test all the edge cases in Maidsafe.

Here in the UK most people pay on debit cards at Amazon. For a typical UK business it costs them 12p (~20c) so Amazon is probably paying about half that so ~10c so hardly any difference to a Bitcoin transaction. With credit cards they likely pay less than 1% but that is speculation.
Lets just say for arguments sake that 1% of transactions go wrong using Bitcoin (it is probably a lot greater than that given people have all sorts of trouble with Coinbase and mobile wallets) An average transaction is worth $100 and it costs staff $1 to sort out a problem with a transaction, email customer, perform refund. That means they would be paying around 1% to support Bitcoin payments. At the moment Amazon have virtually no payment support staff because it is all automated. Customers can't overpay or underpay with a credit card, they either pay or don't pay. With Bitcoin that doesn't happen, maybe in another year we will have reliable payment systems in place but we don't right now.

Based on a 1Gb/s connection. An ASIC can easily verify 100 000 transactions given we have chips that can do 1 000 000 000 sha256 hashes per second.
The other assumption I made is that all unspent outputs can be stored in memory such that the processor can verify the inputs haven't been spent yet without having to do a very slow disk seek. This is maybe an optimistic assumption but there are many methods of pruning unspent outputs and selecting those that are most likely to be spent.

When you make a transaction you specify what conditions need to be met to allow the bitcoin to be spent again. In a normal transaction you specify that the next spender of the bitcoin must be able to prove they have the private key which is linked to a specific address. With a m of n multi-signature transaction you specify that the next spender must be able to prove they have access to m private keys corresponding to any of n public keys. Those private keys might belong to just one person or to multiple people.
This sort of creates a weird situation where the analogy of bitcoins sitting in addresses breaks down.
Indeed multi-signature transactions can be used like 2FA where you need to know 2 private keys in order to spend the bitcoin.

It seems impossible to me, to put real world data and identities into a protocol which doesn't understand these concepts, the users with the most coins and computing power will be able to game the system very easily.
The developers seem to be burying their heads in the sand and pushing on with implementing their ideas without any in depth analysis of whether they are working on something which is achievable.

You tell the exchange that you want to buy them for say x dollars. If there is somebody offering to sell at less than x dollars then the trade goes ahead, if not your order goes onto the exchange orderbook. You have to wait until somebody offers to sell you bitcoins for x dollars. This is called making a bid.

Bitcoin is an electronic cash which does not need a centralised computer or server to operate. It allows online payments between people without a 3rd party. Digital currencies don't work if funds can be spent more than once (this is called double spending). Bitcoin solves the double-spending problem by putting all transactions into an ongoing chain based on proof of computational work. This forms a record that can't be changed without doing computational work. The longest chain not only proves transactions have occurred in a certain order, it also proves that the chain was created by the largest group of computing power. As long as the majority of the computing power is controlled by users that are not attacking the network, they'll generate a longer chain than any attackers. The bitcoin network has no strict structure. Messages between users don't require any guarantee that they will all be received. Users can leave and rejoin the network at any time, the longest chain tells them what happened while they were gone.

You'll get the same problem expressed on Bitcoin like communism is a hugely complex thing. If you explain it in an easy to understand way people don't get a chance to appreciate the whole value of it.
You have two choices here, you can go down the marketing route and simply use huge amounts of PR and advertising to paint a pretty picture of everyone's lives being made better by bitcoin. It would generate the most number of interested people in bitcoin but it wouldn't be honest. It wouldn't represent the teething problems with bitcoin and the number of people that get scammed.
Or you can slowly wait for bitcoin to mature by being honest about the failings of bitcoin, by being honest with the fact that bitcoin services and stretched to capacity right now. (as anyone who has tried to contact coinbase or MtGox or blockchain.info customer support will know only too well). People are entitled to their opinions about bitcoin and many people express valid opinions, we have to slowly erode away the scepticism by not being confrontational but by being knowledgeable and respecting the opinions of others.
I get annoyed by evangelical Christians preaching to me so I refuse to preach about bitcoins to other people unless they are genuinely interested in it.

The evidence may not exist. If the coins are protected by a brain wallet or a remembered password, then we just have to accept what Karpeles says. There is nothing to stop him claiming the coins are lost, waiting a few decades and then using the password to spend the bitcoins.
It's an inherent part of how bitcoin works, one of its greatest features is one of its greatest drawbacks. Nobody can force you to reveal you have access to certain bitcoin addresses, and nobody can seize those addresses from you.

I think you mean it disappeared from blockchain.info which isn't the same thing as the blockchain. Transactions only get onto the blockchain if they are included in a block.

1. In my opinion its best to have bitpay convert to USD because as a business this is the currency you use to buy stock, pay wages and taxes. You can buy bitcoins using money from your personal account if you want to own them as an investment. This makes the accounting simpler and means your business does not have to worry about additional regulations and taxes from keeping bitcoins. It somewhat defeats the point of bitcoin but when the regulations and the tax status becomes more clear you can start keeping bitcoins.
2. For the value you are talking about you don't need to wait for confirmation. Double spend without confirmations is very difficult and is not profitable for anything less than $100. There is no precedent of double spend using Bitpay so I don't know who would take the loss but I would presume that you would. If you were to wait for just one confirmation you could be waiting 0-30+ minutes (blocks occur roughly every 10 minutes)
3. I would personally get a cheap android tablet as opposed to a phone because its easier to handle but that phone will work.
4. I think people would be interested if the price is right.

The debate of how we trade off risk vs other resources (time, computing power, fees) is one that is certainly worth having.
At the moment if you want to trade with the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions then you have to do this off the block chain. This involves risk. That risk could be mitigated if say all bitcoin funds held in a bitcoin exchange are controlled using 2-of-3 transactions. Each exchange would have oversight by two independent arbiters one of which must sign off all transactions going out of the exchange (along with the exchange). If there are problems with the exchange then both arbiters would step in to return funds as best they could.

You can already use multisig to protect your savings in a basic way (but slightly less secure). Say you want to protect it such that 2 of 3 can recover the private key. Simply take your private key and encrypt it (with a key that each of the 3 people know for added security) Then give the first person the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th... bits. Give the second person the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th... bits. Give the third person the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th... bits. That way only if you have 2 of the three people can you recover the private key. This 2 of 3 scheme does reduce security by a factor of 3 but that isn't an issue with current computing power. The only other risk is that someone saves the whole encrypted private key before it is split up so you should get a trusted computer to do this and delete the key.

Thankfully most of the costs in mining right now are the capital costs i.e. the cost to buy the equipment, so it is the miners interest to keep mining but no to buy any new ASICs. This means that the network difficulty will likely not increase at the same rate but won't decrease either. There will however be a large lag between a change in bitcoin price and the change in rate of difficulty because of the time between ordering mining equipment and it being placed online.

Firstly, everyone seems to be overlooking the obvious. It is more likely that Szabo's blogspot account has been compromised than that he is suddenly on twitter with no explanation and starts posting links on his blog without actually hyperlinking them.
Secondly, Nick Szabo almost certainly isn't Satoshi. Here is my reasoning:
- Juola &amp; Associates, (text analysis experts) have ruled out that Szabo could be Satoshi according to [this forbes article](
- My fairly amateur analysis of their punctuation on [Szabo's blog]( and [Staoshi's forum posts]( Satoshi always places the period inside the parentheses ".)" when he places a whole sentences inside them whereas Szabo places it outside ")." The number of instances of this occurring is unfortunately too low to be conclusive.
- Whilst [Szabo has a degree in computer science from Washington University]( there is no evidence of him producing any C++ code. [Szabo's code commenting style]( is very different from Satoshi's.
- Satoshi said very little in the way of expressing political and cultural views whereas Szabo had done [extensive research into the history of money](
- Satoshi reckoned [micropayments were possible with bitcoin]( whereas Szabo argued that they [require too much mental calculation to be feasible](
- Satoshi stated ["I'm better with code than with words though."]( whereas Szabo is clearly [very good with words](

Another point to add is that in future you will be able to create time locked transactions so that the funds get locked up for many months or years before being released, this would make it hard for the government to tax because even with the private key the bitcoins can't be transferred and therefore can't be sold.

What you post online under your own name in open forums is largely considered to be in the public domain. I posted [this]( to reddit and I was in two minds as to whether I was right to do so or not.
The email was submitted as part of a public consultation so Dorian accepted that this piece would become part of the public domain. His email on the other hand maybe shouldn't be in the public domain so I redacted that in the image that I posted. Unfortunately there was no way to prove authenticity without providing the source and the source has his full email address.
My motive is clear I want to prove this man is not Satoshi so he can get on with the rest of his life in tranquillity. I certainly condone anyone who tries to email or phone him or even leave comments on things he has posted online. That is harassment. But I see there is a blurred line between harassment, invasion of privacy and investigation and my post was clearly within that blurred zone.

It's not about the ideas, it's about the execution. A lot of people have good ideas and anyone can steal a good idea. But turning that good idea into a profitable business is the really tough part. 
The important part of your business idea is keeping your customers using your services. You can get them to accept bitcoins all day long but if no one in your city have bitcoins there won't be much spending going on. Your focus will thus be two fold, convincing customers to buy bitcoins and also convincing merchants to accept bitcoins. You need to think about both of these things equally.
As an investor I would not invest because your local focus means your business will always be restricted by the size of your locality. It will likely make you some good money but it won't be making me a huge return of investment on such a risky venture.

Its a valid point, although one which many bitcoin holders will disagree with. Bitcoin's finite supply is somewhat of a myth. Yes, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins on the blockchain but there is possibility to expand the supply in two ways, the first is as you mentioned to create altcoins which are interchangeable with bitcoins. The value of each altcoin will ultimately tend towards the cost of setting up and securing a new altcoin. We are thus likely to see large conflicts between different coins as they fight to gain traction. The situation is unprecedented so predicting the economic impact of altcoins is very difficult. For me, if altcoins have stable values, can easily be exchanged with low fees into bitcoins to make purchases then they will be used to store value. This will push down the price of a bitcoin however a stable ecosystem might emerge in which all these coins are still good stores of value.
The second way bitcoin supply can be inflated is by using bitcoin banks which are effectively like traditional banks but have no monetary regulation. With interbank credit exchange, fractional reserve banking can happen with bitcoin. With a large amount of bitcoins stored in bitcoin banks, bitcoin's supply could be inflated by these banks in the form of loans, of course these loans won't be backed by real bitcoins. Without government regulation of bitcoin, this supply of credit could lead to devaluation of bitcoin.

I'm not sure what type of research paper this is but you won't be getting unbiased balanced views from I have used bitcoin to spend online however I don't go out of my way to spend bitcoin. As in I don't buy giftcards with bitcoin and I only use it where it is the most convenient form of payment.
I would say that 90% of the bitcoin I bought is purely speculative and I don't intend on spending it in the near future.
I'm in two minds about the future of bitcoin. I don't believe bitcoin is a currency nor will it be a currency in the near future because it is too volatile to be a good store of value and a standard of deferred payment. On the other hand bitcoin does offer a better way of making international payments.
I think as bitcoin gains more and more users and speculators, the rate of innovation will decrease. It will be tremendously difficult to make any large changes to the bitcoin protocol without a big amount of backlash from one or other part of the bitcoin community. Core bitcoin protocol innovation will effectively end but the innovation will switch towards the service providers. Most service providers will put in place services on top of bitcoin which effectively mimic the financial systems we have today. The addition of these services will make bitcoin more and more centralized and regulated. Other experimentation will happen in  altcoins which are likely to gain huge traction over 2014.
There are some fundamental technological issues that remain to be solved until we have the vision of the future that bitcoiners see. Smart contracts for example rely on data from the real world and getting that data into a decentralized system in a reliable and secure way is very difficult if not impossible.
Proof of work is leading to an oligopoly of miners instead of the decentralized system that Satoshi envisioned. Nobody has yet come up with a proof of stake/burn/work system that would work and would incentivize a decentralized network of miners rather than an oligopoly.
I think over the next year we will see the number of merchants steadily increase although this will have little effect on the price of bitcoin. The velocity of bitcoin used in trading through systems like BitPay and Coinbase is so fast that the bitcoin price won't move significantly. Only when merchants hold onto more bitcoin will the price go up and that isn't likely to happen for at least another year.
Institutional investment could also push the price of bitcoin up but I think at this stage large scale investment is also unlikely because bitcoin most investment firms still haven't got their heads around virtual commodities. I would argue that altcoins allow easy creation of more cryptocurrency therefore the finite amount of bitcoin available isn't really a finite amount. Exchanges allow easy conversion between bitcoins and altcoins so altcoins can be used to store value and bitcoin can be used for spending.

It's a very nice blogpost and covers some interesting areas which the general public can understand. I disagree with you  slightly in two areas: The idea that "Bitcoin is predictable" is an over-simplification. Although there will only ever be 21 million coins minted we have no idea how many of those coins are actually in circulation or not. Some coins are deliberately burnt so they can't be spent, others get lost due to carelessness or forgetfulness. No one can know with any certainty how the money supply of Bitcoin is changing due to lost coins. Indeed if one were to be more precise about money one would look at the quantity theory (MV=PQ) which tells us that large supplies with extremely low velocity such as Satoshi's stash of coin contribute less to the value of money than smaller supplies which have much higher velocity.
My second disagreement is that "Cryptocurrencies enable self enforcing cryptocontracts" I'm not sure about the self-enforcing part. I think it would be more accurate to say "Cryptocurrencies might enable self enforcing cryptocontracts" because I have yet to see any proof that this can be done. There are still great hurdles ahead as to how to allow crypto-currencies to interact with the real world. How do you get weather data into the protocol securely without people gaming the system. Depending on how the contracts are decided a very small change in the data could have large financial implications. Relying on humans to input data reliably and unscrupulously is incredibly difficult.

Fair enough, neither system would work for you. You can't back a currency without holding the backing item in some form.
Theoretically it may be possible to create a coin which tracks inflation of the coin itself via some form of secured feed and adjusts the mining and destruction of coins to maintain zero inflation and zero deflation. In practise I don't think it is possible because it would always rely on some humans to input data and they are corruptable.

This question has been asked many times before. If you are going to ask it, at least have an idea of (1) a mechanism of measuring the difficulty of the problems, (2) making the problems harder or easier and (3) making the problems such that no part of them can be computed in advance. 
The first two are possible to solve to some degree but the third point making it not computable in advance of the previous block is difficult. Anything which can't be precomputed surely can't have any worth because we are solving things that 10 minutes ago we didn't know that this problem needed to be solved. This is a fundamental sticking point. Primecoin for example seems to find meaningful primes but in fact the prime numbers it generates have no worth to science or maths.
The solution to this problem might be [proof of burn]( in which we don't need to expend energy mining but instead we simulate the mining process using a much computationally economic process, whether it works in practise is debatable.

It won't work for several reasons, some miners aren't connected to pools so you wouldn't be able to DDOS them, pools know who the legitimate miners are so could very easily prevent DDOS from affecting them. Also the difficulty would still be the same so it would take you much longer to mine each block giving the network enough time to respond and switch from using pools to solo mining.

In a case like this you would use a system where you secure your ticket via the website and get given an address. You then have 24 hours say to make the bitcoin payment. If you don't pay your ticket gets released to the next person on the waiting list.
Each actual bitcoin node can probably process around 1000 transactions per second and in the future dedicated hardware (ASICs) will easily be able to deal with 100 000 transactions per second. (The limiting factor would be the connection speed not the time taken to verify the transaction signature)

To be honest the bitcoin network isn't the blockage. The blockage is all the exchanges and payment processors which work on top of bitcoin. Almost none of these services have adequate customer support and resources to support the very small number of bitcoin users at the moment let alone if their are many more users.
Just look at the number of posts on about not being able to contact coinbase support or bitstamp support (lets not mention MtGox support). The rate of growth at the moment is too fast for the services to catch up with demand. To be fair many of these services are slowly getting there after the slowdown in new users following the price stagnation this year.

It's a lovely idea. I like the idea of such a system that has the benefits of both worlds.
Only problem is that proof of burn should preferably work in both directions. I should be able to burn my cryptocurrency to get some dollars back. This might be possible if the ATMs are made such that they store the dollars and can spit them back out when you destroy your cryptocurrency.
If you couldn't burn both ways the price of the cryptocurrency would just remain lower than the price of the dollar and there would never be any incentive to burn your dollars to get less value in return.

1. Yes, it's a false assumption as seen when the price didn't shift when large retailers overstock.com and tigerdirect.com started accepting bitcoin at the beginning of the year. If retailers convert currency directly back into USD it has almost no influence on the price. 
To understand why you need to understand the quantity theory of money MV = PQ where M is the money supply (12 million coins), V is the velocity of money or how many times it changes hands in a year, P is the price of a dollar in bitcoins(note this is the inverse of the price of bitcoins in dollars) and Q is the volume of transactions in dollars spent per year in the bitcoin economy.
To decrease P (increase the value of a bitcoin) one must either decrease M (impossible with bitcoins), decrease V (make less transactions with bitcoins) or increase Q (spend more using bitcoin). Adding retailers to the bitcoin space increases Q so one would expect the value of a bitcoin to go up but when retailers quickly convert bitcoins to dollars this increases V significantly. This means that more retailers does not necessarily equate to a lower or higher bitcoin price.
2. Because running an exchange is difficult, it involves a lot of effort to comply with laws both locally and internationally. It is also difficult technically as seen by the problems at MtGox recently. There is definitely some new exchanges in the pipeline but it takes time to get the funding and regulatory clearances to start a new one.

A well written thoughtful article. The problem with blockchains is that they require an incentive for people to secure them. Therefore you have to reward people with things that have value. And another currency is born. Every blockchain at the moment has an associated currency and that is a bit of a problem. I can't build my social network blockchain without building an associated social network currency which has to have value otherwise my network isn't wells secured.

At the end of 2013 there were 12.1 million bitcoins that had been mined and up till the end of 2013 0.4 million bitcoins were lost. Supply inflation is calculated as 1.3/12.1 = 10.7% but currency inflation is calculated as (1.3-0.1)/(12.1-0.4)=10.3%
Unfortunately we can't calculate the exact number of coins which were lost so we can't be sure what currency inflation actually is.

Conferences are typically organised so they make a profit/break even. Conferences typically cost at least $100 per head. For this reason alone you can't have diverse conferences, you simply attract those people who can afford to travel to a conference and can afford the admission price.
This of course means you attract white businessmen in their 30s-50s, who have a fair amount of disposable income.
The solution is, you don't have conferences and you have meetups and over events instead or you do them on a budget and get as much sponsorship money as possible to subsidise the cost.

The problem is excluding the government controlled nodes from the network is practically infeasible.

Let's start from the top: "Each blockchain tracks a random subset of the wallets on the network" how does it do this tracking? What does to track even mean?
"1.1 reports its aggregate balance as 4." How do the parent nodes know that 1.1 is telling the truth? How does it do this reporting?
"Each blockchain in the blocktree is composed of n hosts" What is a host?
"Each host contributes the same volume of persistent storage to the network, this makes becoming a host difficult (and therefore prevents sybil attacks)." How does a host prove it has contributed enough storage?
"In each block, certain tasks must be accomplished:" What is a block? How can you be in a block?
"every host sends its own update to every other host" is it feasible to contact every other host? What if there are 10,000 hosts?
I could go on but that is enough for now.

In my personal opinion it depends on whether altcoins develop into what people believe to be good stores of value. Converting between bitcoins and altcoins is very easy using a number of exchanges because it is completely digital and pretty much unregulated. For this reason I believe that it is possible to increase crypto-currency supply and hence create a state where bitcoins price needn't increase with increased demand. I see a fairly long period ahead where we see increased adoption by merchants and communities but no real change in price.

Remember you don't need to print a paper wallet, you can simply use a pen and some paper to write your private key down and I would always advise people to encrypt their wallets using a scrypt scheme as suggested in [BIP 38]( Scrypt means it will take milliseconds rather than nanoseconds for an attacker to brute force each password combination so even a very short password can give high security and allow you to store your private key in an insecure location such as dropbox or a memory stick.

It's currently about $60 million USD which is probably a few hundred supermarkets transaction volume.

Unfortunately, the more bitcoin is used to facilitate real world transactions, the more the velocity increases so spending bitcoins may or may not lead to the price going up or down depending on what the merchants do with their bitcoins.

It sounds like a lot but if I wanted to use bitcoin to send $50 of cash to a friend I would probably pay between 3 and 5% over the market rate to buy bitcoins with my $50. My friend would probably have to sell at 3-5% below market rate to sell the bitcoins I sent to him to get $50 in cash. Overall that works out to be 6-10% using bitcoin so Walmart is not that bad.
BTW if you can find somewhere I can buy $50 worth of bitcoin using cash for less than 3% above market rate please tell me!

1. Look at what has happened to the price recently. Runaway deflation followed by inflation followed by a bit of stability. Depending on external influences, the price of Bitcoin varies and it will always be unstable. Larger adoption by big investors and a larger futures market might reduce the volatility somewhat but over the long term Bitcoin will likely act like gold with periods of inflation and deflation.
There is no central bank so making the Bitcoin price stable is virtually impossible.
2. Transaction fees incentivise the miners once all the Bitcoin has been mined.

At a fundamental software level this is how it works. Users may not be aware but each transaction is denominated in satoshis (analogous to slices of pizza which can't be further subdivided). So to increase the number of decimals we can't subdivide the pizza slices, we have to get more pizzas and dish the slices out proportionally.

He makes a good point that Dogecoin is not going to inflate forever. When lost coins are put into the equation, dogecoin is going to have a net negative supply before bitcoin. 
Unfortunately there is a fatal flaw in his argument comparing USD to crypto-currencies: comparing currency supply inflation to price inflation. If you were to compare price inflation with price inflation, USD is much more predictable.

The concern then is how to prevent double spending. There are two approaches, one you can't double spend once you have signed the transaction, two you can't double spend only once the recipient has signed the transaction.
In the first case you have the problem of how do you deal with rejected transactions. Do they fail after a certain time period, in which case the  recipient has to come online before the time period expires.
In the second case, users can send out many transactions using the same funds and those recipients who are quickest to get online and sign the transaction would take ownership of the coins. This would lead to problems because many spam transactions could be sent using a small amount of funds which could jam up the network.

Maidsafe is limited by the slowest time it takes to retrieve a chunk of data. A chunk of data retrieval is limited by the fastest of the (4) nodes storing that data.
If one of your chunks is being stored by four very slow nodes (more likely the larger your file), the overall file will load very slowly.

Every 2016 blocks. (144 blocks per day * 14 days in two weeks) the bitcoin difficulty changes such that with the new difficulty, the previous 2016 blocks would have been solved in exactly 14 days (although the difficulty can't go up or down by more than a multiple of 4). The speed with which blocks are found is dependent on the difficulty and on the power of the network. Faster processors are constantly being added to the network and the speed at which they operate is increasing almost exponentially. This causes the exponential rise in difficulty. Difficulty is measured in multiples of the minimum difficulty which is set to be 1 correct hash per ~4billion attempts.

I'm trying to reverse engineer this. The Unlock QR code point to a non existent document: 
The data is base 64 encoded and for a 2 of 2 code there are 312 bits of which 180bits are identical between the 2 unlock data pieces and 132bits are different. 
A private key is 256 bits so the two 132 bit parts are probably combined to create the private key and the shared 180 bits are probably the public key (160bits) associated to it. I will do some more investigation.

The first comment you linked to is incorrect. Sidechains will theoretically be able to do whatever they want, they are not limited to bitcoin scripting.
Also the implementation as far as I envisage it won't allow necessarily coins to be stolen by 51% attack. It depends upon the structure of the side-chain. (Of course my interpretation of the protocol idea may be wrong)

It's actually dictated by game theory / human psychology.

Highly inadvisable and can't be done securely because there is no guarantee that the private key hasn't been recorded.

Amazon hardly needs publicity, everyone who has heard of Bitcoin has heard of amazon.com.

The income increase would be minimal given people using Bitcoin at the moment simply buy Amazon gift cards with Bitcoin to shop at Amazon. And Amazon cares little about creating a place in history, they are focused on growing their sales figures, i.e. how can they increase their market share of retail. They can't do that any better with Bitcoin.
Yes, if Amazon wanted to move into developing markets and people in developing markets had more access to Bitcoin than they do today, Bitcoin would be a great tool for them. But it isn't right now.

You can't peg a crypto-currency to an existing currency by definition. To be able to peg a currency you must be able to create the coins at will (otherwise the government might run out of coins). Crypto-currencies rely on the fact that coins can only be created in mining. If coins can be created in another way then it is no longer a crypto-currency and international payments will not be possible to the same degree because it relies on one government being trusted. (Which is why we have different currencies around the world and trillions of dollars of trade on the forex markets every day)

I feel similar to you. I don't have particularly strong political views. I don't necessarily believe there is any reason why a bitcoin should appreciate in price.
I'm purely interested in the technology. How can we make it easier and cheaper to send value overseas and when using the internet. Bitcoin seems like one good option.
Unfortunately the bitcoin world is mostly delusional. Many of the use cases for bitcoin are simply not easier or cheaper than existing technologies. Most merchants accepting bitcoin don't make significant cost savings (many don't even get any customers paying in bitcoin). Paying using bitcoin in a physical shop is still not simple, it takes longer than a normal transaction and there is always a risk some part of the technology chain will break down. Online payments for services is where bitcoin really excels, I can make payments with just a few clicks and I can manage the amount of security I want myself.
The problem is that too few people are interested in bitcoin as a technology as opposed to bitcoin for speculating. There are just a few people actively developing the bitcoin code. Bitcoin needs many more developers, testers and people developing the underlying infrastructure.

The squarespace back end is closed off so there is no possibility of adding bitcoin payments via any method into your site. The best you can do is say you accept bitcoins and get people to email you to sort out a bitcoin order. That might work depending on how you operate your business.

These are nice ideas but they need a lot of thought to work out if they are actually introducing other attack vectors.
My first thought is, if I was a miner why would I bother to vote someone as being honest? I want to increase my share of the coins by trying to make everyone else look dishonest. Unless of course, my block could be voted as being dishonest if I don't vote other blocks as being honest. (In that case we get back to the original problem, everyone would vote everyone else as being honest to ensure they get paid)
Could dishonest users submit false transactions to make other miners seem dishonest?
Also miners can get rewards for performing Finney attacks through other means than the coinbase reward, they can be paid directly by the customers.

Proof of stake is not really proof of stake, it is proof of coin age (days since last transaction x value of coins). When you mine a block, you sacrifice coin age for coins. This stops people with lots of coins mining many blocks in a row. The problem is that coin age is only sacrificed if your block is mined upon. If your block is orphaned, coin-age is not sacrificed (unlike bitcoin where you perform physical work whether your block is orphaned or not).
This means you can mine on top of orphaned blocks with no cost to yourself. This has negligible benefit though because the rewards for mining a block are proportional to the coin age. This means you can mine one block a year or one block a day with the same coins and essentially receive the same amount of reward over the same year.
There is no real incentive to mine on the main chain, but there is no incentive to mine on orphaned blocks either. On balance coin holders want their coins to have value so don't want forks so choose to stay on the same chain.
The main problem is that proof of stake is vulnerable to long range attacks. Here is how the attack works. Someone (or a group) borrows a lot of money to buy up around 70% of all the coins. They then immediately sell the coins and pay back their debt. Secretly the attacker produces proof of stake blocks which only involve his or her coins starting from the moment just before they started selling their coins. This allows the attacker to reinvent the blockchain without the transactions which sold their coins. This allows them to keep building the block chain until it is longer than the real chain. The attacker then presents this chain to the network, given it is the longer chain all the clients switch to mining on it, many transactions are effectively reversed at this point (people stop owning coins they thought they owned) and the network is effectively compromised.
This attack has virtually no cost (if a third party is willing to lend a large sum of money to buy the coins). Of course the network could, when shown the longer chain, simply reject it but then the security of the network doesn't depend on the longest chain but rather upon some other form of consensus which may be centralised or vulnerable to Sybil and social engineering attacks.

Whilst hand scanning would work, the idea of bitcoin is to trust no other device/system so you can use it in places you don't trust. If you have to load a system with bitcoin in order to use it with a hand scanner, you might as well load it up with dollars. NFC is a much better technology because people trust their phones and make sure they are secure themselves. Of course bitcoin wallets on phones could use hand scanning to unencrypt the wallet, and we will likely see this technology come about.

Bitcoin uses integer maths as opposed to floating point maths because integer maths is always perfectly correct whereas with floating point maths you can get tiny rounding errors. The downside is that the smallest value you can represent is a fixed amount. In reality the satoshi is small enough that there is 300 000 satoshis for every person on Earth. This is more than enough unless bitcoin becomes the predominant currency used for everything, everywhere.

Well first people were worried you couldn't withdraw fiat from MtGox so everyone bought bitcoins pushing the price up.
Now people are worried MtGox isn't able to supply bitcoins and may have lost control of a large number of bitcoins so everyone wants fiat. This has pushed the price down.
Unfortunately seeing this fall in price at MtGox people at other exchanges have become worried that their coins aren't worth as much as they thought because you can buy them cheaper at MtGox. Therefore people have decided to sell anticipating that the collapse of MtGox will cause bitcoins to lose value.

It would be great if we could prove software "correct" using a theorem prover. Unfortunately software like bitcoin is far too complex for that to ever be possible. (Also bitcoin depends on results from psychology in order to work.) Bitcoin has many tests which it runs through before each release however these don't cover every aspect, only the most critical parts (and those that people have thought of.)
What we need is more people looking at the [source code]( Every change to the code is analysed by multiple developers but we need many more people looking for bugs and checking each change.
Theoretically a dozen or so people could conspire together and introduce backdoors into bitcoin. This won't happen however because the source code is open and anyone can check to see if they have done something they shouldn't have and at that point nobody will trust theme ever again.
OpenSSL failed mostly because many millions of people decided to use the software without either analysing the software themselves or doing the research to work out if anyone else had analysed it to check it was secure.
Bitcoin is in beta. There is still a small chance a critical bug could be found and the system will collapse. Therefore you should treat it as such, do not have more value stored in bitcoin than you can afford to lose.

Your methodology is highly flawed.
1. For something to be a good store of value the inverse of the price must also hold its value just as well. An asset which increases in price constantly is not a good store of value unless you assume that no one ever takes out a loan. If I were to take out a loan in bitcoin I would struggle to pay it back making it a very poor store of value.
2. You have inflation adjusted the dollars but not any of the other asset.
3. You have used 100 years of data for the dollar but only several years for bitcoin and gold. The comparison simply isn't valid.

A change in either the maximum block size or the frequency of blocks. Both are things that the developers do not want to change until they have to because there is considerable debate in the community about whether increasing the block size will increase the centralization of bitcoin.
There is another way of increasing the bitcoin transactions without increasing actual bitcoin transactions on the blockchain by using offline transactions which are handled by payment processors like paypal. For example I make one transaction a month to paypal to fund my account and I can use this to make many transactions. Paypal simply sends an aggregated transaction to the merchants once per day. This way the number of transactions on the blockchain is very low but you have to trust a third party.

That is true but it would require for every client to have a hardcoded, instruction telling it to transfer the MtGox coins to a new address without a valid signature. It is technically possible but politically inconceivable. Even those people who have coins lost on MtGox would likely reject this solution. One would have to gain the support of at least 50% of the miners and the major bitcoin exchanges and other bitcoin infrastructure.
It would be possible if such a mechanism was expressly built into bitcoin or the idea discussed long before bitcoin became mainstream however at this point in time I see no possibility of such a hard coded solution.

Yes, it would raise the price. I simplified the attack to make it seem more plausible and more difficult. In reality, not all coin-age is spent on mining blocks, most is actually used up in regular transactions. This means you only need 5-20% of the coins to make the attack work.
One can also buy then sell, then buy again as long as the coins that are bought second time around are not linked in any way to the coins which were sold. This means that with careful calculation and a large pool of liquidity, you can work your way up to 70% holdings in your secret chain without ever actually owning more than a few percent of the coins in the main chain. In fact you don't even need to buy the coins outright, you just need to have control of them at some point, this could be through a front such as a gambling site or an exchange.
Finally you don't make the holders of the coin rich because you produce selling pressure afterwards to get back your cash.

Nodes are just people who run the core bitcoin client (with outgoing connections enabled), they are not necessarily miners. They effectively relay transactions (and other messages) through the network.
There are several components to loading the block chain, the first is getting the block data. This is typically very slow with the default bitcoin client because it downloads all the blocks sequentially from a single node. If this node has a slow data rate, your download will take a long time. This can be sped up by using a torrent instead.
The bitcoin developers are discussing ways of speeding up block downloads by having clients using multiple nodes and also by allowing clients to download just the block headers followed by the transaction data. One can reason that internet speeds will get faster at a faster rate than the bitcoin block chain grows so that in the future it will take less time to download.
The second part is verifying transaction data, this involves processing every one of the millions of transactions and confirming that it is correct. On a decent computer this should take a few hours. I envisage that in future hardware will be produced which is specialised to deal with bitcoin transactions and can process these transactions in just a few minutes.
Pruning transactions won't speed up the process because the transactions still have to be downloaded to work out if they can be pruned or not.

So that now allows effective denial of service attacks where large numbers of people claim their votes are invalid and wish to vote again.

Workarounds are possible without a fork but transactions refer to other transactions by txid and with the current malleability you can't reference any transaction which aren't yet in the block chain. To fix this requires an overhall of the bitcoin signature system or of the txid and that would mean a soft fork.

I agree, most likely vector in this case is unencrypted emails. Sniffing over a compromised secure wifi or simply an untrusted unsecure wifi network stealing data.
I disagree that you shouldn't use SMS as a second factor. To crack GSM requires some fairly sophisticated equipment and software (although not that expensive) It also requires the sniffing hardware to be in the locality of the target and requires the target to be identified as being linked to a specific blockchain account. To gain such information requires a very high level of sophistication. It would be much easier for a thief to go after simpler targets such as non 2fa accounts.

Andreas makes a key point here, Bitcoin is becoming political. Whether you like it or not, decisions on the protocol of Bitcoin are not being made by consensus of the miners but by the opinions and beliefs of the core development team. If they choose to do nothing, nothing will get changed in the Bitcoin protocol regardless of what the users think. If there is not an extremely clear consensus among Bitcoin users, the developers are most likely to be conservative and not make changes in order to keep a very small percent of the users happy.
In total, this equates to a stagnation of Bitcoin development, alt-coins will be innovating at a much faster rate. These alt-coins can add new features and can be much more radical without risk of political forces. The future for me lies in a second version of Bitcoin which includes a [proof-of-burn functionality]( which will allow people to transfer value between the old and the new coins without any change in value. The main economic properties (rate of creation of coins, total number of coins in circulation) need to stay constant but the other properties can all change. The challenge which still needs to be solved is how to transition between the new currencies whilst still having a fixed number of coins in total circulation.

- My fairly amateur analysis of their punctuation on [Szabo's blog]( and [Staoshi's forum posts]( Satoshi always places the period inside the parentheses ".)" when he places a whole sentences inside them whereas Szabo places it outside ")." The number of instances of this occurring is unfortunately too low to be conclusive.
- Whilst [Szabo has a degree in computer science from Washington University]( there is no evidence of him producing any C++ code. [Szabo's code commenting style]( is very different from Satoshi's.
- Satoshi said very little in the way of expressing political and cultural views whereas Szabo had done [extensive research into the history of money](
- Satoshi reckoned [micropayments were possible with bitcoin]( whereas Szabo argued that they [require too much mental calculation to be feasible](
- Satoshi stated ["I'm better with code than with words though."]( whereas Szabo is clearly [very good with words](

There would be extra signed blocks which basically add up the value transacted in the last say 5,000 blocks and have a list of all addresses and how much their balance has changed since the last consolidation block.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:24:10
Heres a fundamental question that no coin has yet been able to solve. What's to stop a miner from sending the same block to the network twice but one includes a transaction and one doesn't?
With proof of work including an extra transaction causes the hash of the block to change and therefore it doesn't meet the requirements to be a valid block. But with schemes that don't rely on proof of work, the miner can send many blocks each subtly different because now the hash of the block no longer has to conform to specific properties (in bitcoin be less than the target in primecoin be a divisor of the prime found) Without some form of proof of work I can't see how mining can possibly work.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:19:44
I'm not sure exactly why discussions about exchanges, marketplaces and regulation should feature in a book about the implementation of cryptography.
Bitcoin consists broadly of three parts. The first is standard digital signatures (ECDSA) to authorise the transfer of virtual assets, this technology has been around over 20 years and is widely used in most of the financial industry. Digital signatures are mathematically secure, they can be easily modelled and they work.
The second part is the novel invention of a system which can produce decentralised global consensus using proof of work. This part of bitcoin is somewhat contentious, it is not mathematically secure, being susceptible to a number of psychological and economical attacks. Economic modelling is hard and with certain assumptions, proof of work is not secure. In reality, bitcoin has proven to have very few problems (other than the constant expenditure of energy and pointless computer chips) over its short lifetime. Unfortunately, economic modelling can fall apart when circumstances change so there is no guarantee the consensus mechanism will stay secure.
The third part of bitcoin is the assignment of collectiblity to the virtual assets involved in bitcoin. The amount of assets is limited making them ideal as a speculative asset. Like other collectibles such as gold, silver, fine art, fine wines, property land, and autographs, having a limited supply makes them an ideal target for people wanting to increase their wealth. The intrinsic value of these items is not important, bitcoin has no intrinsic value but it still valued because of the self reinforcing belief that bitcoins will have a greater or equal value in the future. The lack of any use physical use for virtual assets and the fact that no power structure backs bitcoin means that its price will always be volatile and impossible to predict with any certainty. Economic models simply don't exist today to model anything like bitcoin, it is an economic experiment. 
Combining these 3 parts means that bitcoin has become a valuable tradeable virtual asset which can be used in a similar way to a currency.
Is it ground breaking technologically, yes, but there is no proof that the technology is secure, just empirical evidence. More ground breaking, is the cultural milieu it has created, a crazy international melting pot of entrepreneurs, computer scientists, anarchists, libertarians, charities, fraudsters, venture capitalists, speculators, hackers...
The cultural milieu defines bitcoin to a greater extent than the core technology, indeed most people are ignorant of the technology and the technology is being underdeveloped. But does this really matter? The internet has proven that amazing things can be created on the back of a less than ideal protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:55:42
I agree with your points completely. The only thing that would convince me that this Dorian is the Bitcoin creator is if links were proven between him and Nick Szabo's cryptography group. Satoshi was at least heavily influenced by Szabo's work on BitGold and Chaums work on ecash.

I'll concede the point, it depends on your definition of store of value and whether you include what wikipedia calls "Standard of deferred payment" within that.
The dollar is so stable in value that you simply can't measure with any statistical reliability how much it's value goes up and down from day to day. The metric you are looking for simply does not exist. The nearest metric you have is the monthly inflation data. Even that data is hard to measure with much accuracy and depends what assumptions you make. That is why there are many inflation indexes such as RPI, PPI, CPI, core inflation.
Bitcoin will only become a currency once we can measure inflation in terms of the price of goods and services in bitcoin rather than converting its price back into dollars and looking at the inflation adjusted value of the dollar.

Bitcoin was and still is in beta. There have been and will be some rather serious bugs in bitcoin. It shouldn't be used to store large amounts of value or to make critical transactions.

Part 1: You have just described the quantity theory of money. The supply of money isn't important. It's the supply multiplied by the velocity.
Part 2: Yes the US government or any large holder of coins could temporarily push down the market price to extremely low levels but whether the markets could recover from that is another question. In some ways you can't equate bitcoins to other currencies because people have a choice of using a cryptocurrency or using a government backed currency.
The choice of which currency to use leads to interesting effects, inflation or deflation of a currency don't directly lead to economic growth or depression. Instead you simply see shifts in where value is stored. For example money went into dogecoin last week and the price of doge went up. Now the bitcoin price is recovering money is shifting back into bitcoin and the doge price is going down.

I was particularly impressed by your research into the background of the bitcoin invention although I'm not sure I share your conclusion about why bitcoin only emerged in 2008. I don't think it is to do with computational power. Rather that for bitcoin to succeed it needed both the cryptographic ideas that had been provided before and also the inventors knowledge of economic concepts and programming. The system that was released had to be able to run on peoples computers and it had to provide some economic incentive for doing so. Satoshi managed to come up with incentive solutions: the deflationary characteristics and the fungibility of bitcoins. He also had the perseverance to write a large amount of code to make bitcoin functional.

Threshold signatures work very differently from multi signatures. Multi signatures rely on scripting and the consensus of the bitcoin protocol whereas threshold signatures rely on cryptography.
Advantages of threshold signatures:
- Better privacy/anonymity, the network can't see who signed the transaction.
- Security policies can be changed in some circumstances without having to make a bitcoin transaction.
- Transactions have a small size (they look identical to ordinary bitcoin transactions).
- Unlimited number of share holders can be involved. Currently, multi signatures are limited to 15 by the protocol. 
Advantages of multi signatures:
- Signatures can be provided independently. Threshold signatures require multiple interactive rounds.
- Produce a public record of who signed a transaction.
- Can be implemented without the need of specialised software and secure communication protocols to deal shares. Only requires software which can sign a transaction.
- Scripting allows the easy creation of arbitrary security policies where some keys have more importance than others (e.g. of 5 possible keys require either key a or key b and c or key b and key d and key e). This is possible to some degree with threshold signatures.
It is also important to note that multi signatures can be combined with threshold signatures to get some of the advantages of both systems.

It would help if people actually understand how Bitcoin works. Go to [github]( read the code, understand how it works, learn about the security and the cryptography.
There are too many people building platforms on top of bitcoin without understanding how the native protocol works. This means they are of poor quality, liable to attacks and don't strengthen the ecosystem.
Finally remember Bitcoin is still in Beta. If you want to use Bitcoin to get rich without adding value then you are in the wrong place. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin prices will rise or that the network won't crash.

For me the combination of Sybil attacks, DoS attacks, and timejacking allows for a large area of unexplored territory which is ripe for exploitations which create double spends and confuse other clients. Because most clients run similar software it is fairly easy for an attacker to simulate the attack ahead of time and know the expected behaviour.

Some people know where to find Szabo but after the Dorian debacle, I doubt he wishes to be in the mainstream media.
I disagree that bitcoin comes from Szabo's work. From reading the original paper and source code it is clear to me that it comes primarily from the work by Haber and Stornetta on digital timestamping. The original bitcoin paper referenced 7 sources of which 4 were on the topic of digital timestamping. [The reference to Wei-Dai's b-money was slightly added later.](

You've addressed some interesting ideas but I feel your solutions fall flat. A single identity online is a nice idea and many people have tried to implement it but they have all failed. People just create fake identities online.
Most people fundamentally don't want a single identity. I don't want everyone on the internet to know the exact services I use online. I'm not personally comfortable discussing bitcoin under my real name because it could cause trouble in the future.
How on earth do you check that someone hasn't created two or more identities. The only possible way so far is to check with some centralized government agency. Even if you trust governments, there are some people in some parts of the developing world who have no documentation and do not exist on any government records. They deserve to have an identity online.
If you are going to suggest a protocol at least come up with some basic code to implement it and not just a logo. To succeed in the tech space you have to have a working prototype that people can use and a good economic incentive for people to use your prototype.
I don't fundamentally understand how having things like your name and location in a bitcoin wallet will help because a bitcoin wallet isn't necessarily even connected to the internet. Its just a collection of private keys that you can use to construct transactions.
I'm also not sure about your monetisation system. It sounds good in principle but there is no way of checking with guaranteed certainty what came first on the internet. I'm also not sure that such a system of monetisation would even create something that is useful to the world. Interesting content and ideas still get passed by whilst those that get lucky and get lots of people sharing gain the economic rewards. The system gives positive reinforcement to those who are already famous.

Whilst this potential vulnerability should be taken seriously, it represents somewhat of a deliberate design decision rather than a mistake.
Facebook and twitter for example allows the exact same attack of feeding email addresses into the search bar/friend finder and getting back names.
There should arguably be some sort of spam limit however a person may legitimately want to send 1000 people payment requests simultaneously. Probably the best solution is an extra verification step for people who wish to send more than x number of payment requests per day.

I hate these infographics because you simply can't work out wealth inequality from the inequality of bitcoin addresses. Some people quite rightly spread their wealth over many addresses. Others share addresses with thousands of other people. Most importantly, most people don't have their whole wealth in bitcoins. They have dollars in the bank, a car, a house etc...
The numbers are simply meaningless.
Also please don't equate money supply to GDP, they have completely different units. GDP has units of dollars/year. Money supply simply has units of dollars. It's like comparing the speed of a car with the length of a car.

Exactly. There are two reasons for this. Firstly it increases your anonymity because it is hard to know which of the two addresses was the payment and which is your change address. Secondly when you make a transaction your public key for that address is revealed. Before that your public key is protected by the SHA256 and RIPEMD hashing functions such that even if ECDSA was found to be insecure your funds couldn't be spent.

You are correct, buying bitcoins is not investing in the traditional sense because the money isn't used to fund new innovation, factories, research etc. With current rates of deflation there is little incentive to invest in bitcoin related companies, you can make as much profit simply by holding bitcoins. In the future I do see bitcoin reaching somewhat of an equilibrium where investment in companies will become more profitable than simply holding bitcoins.
Winners in that ecosystem will probably be more traditional businesses involved in manufacturing, energy and construction. I see bitcoin and the power of computers in general reducing the power of services companies like banks to make money. Having said that insurance will still be able to generate large revenues from having to have large amounts of capital to cover large disasters.

Its great except that currently most bitcoin transactions work like this: I send bitcoins to bitpay/coinbase. They send the bitcoins to an exchange. The exchange instructs their bank to send dollars to coinbase's/bitpay's bank account. Bitpay/coinbase instruct their bank to send dollars to the merchants bank. At each step a small fee is imposed such that all in all bitcoiners end up paying as much fee than they would do with a standard credit/debit card or paypal, it's just that this fee is hidden from them. And that doesn't even mention the virtual fee (caused by inflation) which exists due to mining.

We have never had a system like bitcoin before so indeed who know what will happen in 10 to 20 years. Its an interesting experiment.
The theory is that people will stick to the rules in order to maximise long term gain but that theory may be wrong, its the small risk you take when you buy bitcoins.
In terms of inflation vs deflation bitcoin is also an experiment. In my opinion the nature of bitcoins could lead to cycles of inflation and deflation (my definition of inflation being the consumer price index) , we've already seen how bitcoin has cycles of high deflation followed by periods of little inflation or deflation. However in the long term I have little idea what will happen, and it will be interesting to watch.

This is a tough question to answer. Firstly there are 3 types of inflation/deflation. There is supply inflation. Clearly bitcoin's supply is inflating and it is inflating at a relatively predictable rate. (25 coins every 10 minutes)
Then there is currency inlfation, this is the inflation due to currency supply but also includes the loss of currency due to lost private keys and bitcoins being sent to unspendable addresses. Currently currency inflation is positive, more coins are being created than being lost but at some point in the future more coins will be lost than created. Currency inflation is more unpredictable because the rate of loss of coins is not well known or predicted.
Lastly there is the form of inflation which most economists use which is price inflation. That is how much value can I get for my bitcoins. Clearly bitcoin has gone through periods of price inflation and price deflation (predominantly deflation up till now). Price inflation is caused by many factors, including the currency inflation. Some bitcoiners believe that price inflation is directly proportional to currency inflation (Austrian school of economics) and this is why they prefer bitcoins over dollars which are being printed at a high rate. 
Personally, I don't think currency inflation is an important factor in the price inflation of bitcoin, instead it is strongly influenced by the number of people using bitcoin and how they choose to save or spend their bitcoins. I believe without a central bank we will see periods of price deflation followed by periods of price inflation in cycles as we see with the [value of gold]( Gold is the nearest thing we have to bitcoin (limited supply, not backed by anything) that we can look at to study the economics of bitcoin.
What effect this price inflation/deflation has on the wider economy is difficult to tell but there will likely be cycles of economic growth followed by economic recession.

Even with the most rigorous set of standards, it would still be possible for the operators to run away with all the bitcoins. I prefer using localbitcoins rather than an exchange because it requires a little less trust.

It's a good article but I disagree with the main points. Firstly customers were going to get money into MtGox any way they could. If Dwolla was completely shutdown, customers would simply have used other potentially more risky ways of transferring capital into MtGox.
 Secondly I disagree with your point that regulation exists for bitcoin. Certainly regulation covers exchanges of dollars into bitcoin but I see no regulation which would protect customers exchanging between say litecoin and bitcoin. There is also no provision in the law for dealing with bitcoins where the private key is lost. 
Also you should probably mention the conflict of interest. Bitcoin is a competitor to your thinklink and facecash systems. Both bitcoin and your systems have their merits and drawbacks.

The website makes absolutely no sense to me. I haven't a clue what Bitshares is.
According to the video, it gets rid of desks, rent, utilities, salaries and equipment and pays all of the money saved to shareholders. And it allows you to transfer shares for free but only for digital companies which exist entirely in software (which don't yet exist).
The best explanation of what bitshares is is hidden on the FAQ page:


Ok, so where is this open source platform? Or is BitShares a company, it seems to be employing people.
So your website claims BitShares is an open source platform, things you can trade like shares, a digital autonomous company and also a regular company? I'm confused.
Overall opinion: lots of words that mean very little and claim to make lots of money. Is it a scam: no, they aren't asking for my money. Is it an advertisment: no, it's open source. I have literally no idea what the point of this website is other than a design exercise for [The Creative momentum](

Your analogy is not factually correct. Every full node in the bitcoin network verifies if transactions are valid or not. They pass on valid transactions and ignore those that are not. Mining simply prevents double spending. It has nothing to do with whether a transaction is valid or not.
Miners produce a single database, they achieve a consensus of transactions and stop people from telling one person they spent their bitcoins with them and telling a different person they spent their bitcoins with them. With mining everyone can verify that everyone agrees on a single unambiguous set of transactions.

I accept this point however the barriers for entry for new technology are extremely low. It would take less than a day for blockchain.info to make modifications to their code and launch dogechain.info it would take me literally minutes to change my business from accepting bitcoins to accepting litecoins. My miners select the most profitable currencies to mine so obviously the network effect of bitcoin has no effect on them.
What gives bitcoin value is the fact that bitcoiners believe bitcoin will have value in the future. I believe that most bitcoiners believe bitcoin will have value in the future therefore I store bitcoin. But as soon as people catch on that they can make more money speculating in other altcoins not bitcoin then they will and the bitcoin price will plummet.

You are absolutely correct. Also if the proof of fractional reserve isn't generated at frequent enough time intervals then the exchanges can cheat.

In an ideal world you use a decentralised threshold cryptography system. 
You select say the 7 most senior employees of the company and decide that 5 of them must conspire together in order to generate new transactions. 
You use a DKG (dealerless key generation) protocol to generate your private key shares which are distributed to your 7 employees. You now have one public key and 7 people with bits of data which they must memorise.
You transfer the bitcoins to that public key/bitcoin address and that becomes the companies secure store of bitcoins (cold wallet), employees in regular meeting decide to allow transactions out of this bitcoin address into wallets which are controlled by a single person/server for the tasks they need to perform in that time period like payroll, client withdrawals, overheads etc.

If I send say 0.00526352 bitcoins to your stealth address, it is very easy for me to search through the blockchain and find the correct transaction however I can't link my transaction to the transactions sent to the same stealth address.
Stealth addresses sole purpose is to allow users to generate multiple payment addresses where only a single one can be displayed such as a physical QR code in a restaurant. I don't wish to change the QR code for every customer but I also don't want customers to know how much money my restaurant is making. Any customer can tell the rest of the world what address their transaction went to but they won't be able to work out when future customers have paid for their meals in the restaurant.
It is always better to generate new addresses on the fly using some code if this is possible rather than use stealth addresses.

It's a good attempt but many people don't understand the terms TCP/IP, peer-to-peer, decentralized, or distributed. 
Miners do not in fact "solve complex algorithms" they just compute the result of a complicated function over and over again with different inputs each time.


That is wrong, bitcoin has 21 million bitcoins because we decided that is the rule and from game theory and human psychology we work out that sticking to the rules is the most profitable situation. With a large enough external incentive, more bitcoins could be produced (as is the case with dogecoin where the main client violated the protocol so they decided to modify the protocol rather than change the client so there is no upper limit on the number of dogecoins which will be produced). The entire network need not necessarily agree with this decision (as with dogecoin) but a majority of miners is required (at least in the scenarios which have been examined so far).
Bitcoin itself will likely never allow completely anonymous transactions or smart contracts but these will be implemented in other crypto-currencies.

The number of instances of this occurring is unfortunately too low to be conclusive.
- Whilst [Szabo has a degree in computer science from Washington University]( there is no evidence of him producing any C++ code. [Szabo's code commenting style]( is very different from Satoshi's.
- Satoshi said very little in the way of expressing political and cultural views whereas Szabo had done [extensive research into the history of money](
- Satoshi reckoned [micropayments were possible with bitcoin]( whereas Szabo argued that they [require too much mental calculation to be feasible](
- Satoshi stated ["I'm better with code than with words though."]( whereas Szabo is clearly [very good with words](

Most of your questions can be answered by the founder Satoshi in his [whitepaper](


There are many advantages when you think of governments that don't have their citizens concerns as a priority. The government can't steal your bitcoins, stop you making purchases or use it to buy whatever you want from wherever in the world you want.
It comes with a few risks, the main one being monetary stability. Central banks should in an ideal world, print enough money to keep inflation low such that your money is worth the same today as next year. They also inject money into areas of growth to stimulate economic output (which could be argued to be a good or a bad thing). Also government has no final authority over bitcoin so if someone steals your money there is nothing they can do. Transactions simply can't be reversed. Finally the government has a limited ability to trace where money is going. They can follow the transactions on the blockchain but with various techniques you can effectively be anonymous using bitcoins.

Given that you posted in the answer you will get is that it hasn't peaked and you should invest.
Bitcoin is purely speculative (like gold) the only way you can quantify if it is worth investing is by asking yourself, do you think other people will buy bitcoin pushing the price up. I can see more people investing buying bitcoin in the future but I can also see people deciding to invest in alternative crypt-currencies.
Bitcoin may have come first and it has some network effect behind it but the barriers for entry for other coins are extremely low. It takes just a few lines of code to turn a bitcoin wallet into a dogecoin wallet and a few lines of code to turn a bitcoin ATM into a litecoin ATM. And it takes less than an hour with less than 0.5% fees to turn my altcoins into bitcoin so I can very easily convert altcoins into bitcoin to spend whilst keeping them in an altcoin as an investment

Don't buy it unless you have negotiated a clause which entitles you to a fee in case it is delivered late. Otherwise you will almost certainly receive the miner late and the chance of making a profit will be gone. And of course you should join a pool with only 300GH/s

There are roughly 9 million bitcoins in circulation today ~3 million have been lost or have not been moved for over 3 years. With 3600 bitcoins being created every day we would expect to see a drop in price of about 0.04% per day.
At the current price 0.04% is about $0.2 drop per day per bitcoin. Obviously the price has over the last few days been dropping much faster than that so mining can't be the only factor here.

I'm not sure about exactly how the anti-spam, anti-DOS,and anti-double-spend mechanisms in the default bitcoin nodes work but I would expect that the expected behaviour would be for identical transactions with increased transaction fees to take priority provided they have not been included in a block.
In an ideal world clients should allow the user to resend transactions with increased fees if the transaction isn't included in a block. I know most clients don't work like this currently.

I've done a lot of digging into these new protocols. Trying to understand how they work, whether they can work in practise. As far as I can tell block chain protocols all rely on proof of pointless work. Various people claim to have implemented systems that work on proof of stake, proof of useful work etc. but when you read into the details they all fundamentally use proof of pointless work with extra useless bits stuck on to try and prove that they are better than everyone else. 
Block chains can also only reliably store information on virtual commodities (Bitcoins, altcoins, dns information, virtual lottery ticket numbers), no system I have seen can reliably store information about real commodities. This means any decentralised block chain system can with the current technology only create systems which transfer virtual commodities. Thus you can build only 3 things: virtual currency exchange, virtual gambling and virtual domain name sales.
Yes, they may allow you to create virtual contracts which refer to things in the real world but no court of law currently admits virtual contracts so that won't work. (Maybe in another decade this will be possible)
Right now the outlook for decentralised corporations is bleak. There is no demand for virtual domain sales, there is more than enough gambling already so the only thing these protocols will solve is virtual currency exchange.
Its a load of hype obscured behind non existent technical concepts. Let's fix the myriad of problems with bitcoin first and then we can worry about doing other much more complicated things.

I would say 2 to 5 million people have some bitcoins based on the number of [blockchain.info wallets]( the number of [bitcoin-qt downloads]( [coinbase users]( [MtGox users]( and [total Bitcoin transactions]( It is difficult to tell exactly because people have multiple wallets and clients and have downloaded software updates. Certainly no more people own Bitcoin than the total number of Bitcoin transactions, so certainly no more than 30 million.
About 60% of those (1 to 3 million) have used Bitcoin to buy something if we use the answers from [this survey]( although I suspect the actual number to be somewhat lower than that due to the survey's sample. Based on [Bitpay figures]( there has been around 200,000 transactions using Bitpay in the last year which suggests less than a million actual Bitcoin purchases in 2013 overall. This suggests fewer than 100,000 people use Bitcoin actively for many purchases.

There are many problems, I haven't even touched on how do you make sure the transaction reaches the correct recipient when the network doesn't know where the recipient is located or when they are online.
Make sure to look up the bitcoin payment protocol. It enables parties that are both online to produce a double signed transaction. It is a layer on top of the core bitcoin layer so it enables the best of both worlds.
Even without such a protocol, you yourself can request that recipients sign something in order to verify they own the address.

It's not a single miner. It's a pool of miners. Hundreds maybe thousands of miners are all contributing to Eligius. This way they are taking less risk. They get paid whether they find a bitcoin block or not, in return for this reduction of risk they pay a small fee to the pool operator.

I can't quite understand why you have so much data given the blockchain itself is 15GB, maybe a few GB for encrypted wallets, another few GB to store user data and another few MB for Blockchain.info labels and messages.
Unless your database is hideously bloated it shouldn't be reaching terrabytes in size.
Not only that but your claim of:

They both use AES256 encryption but BIP38 uses scrypt to go from the passphrase to the actual key. I believe (although I have no source) that multibit uses a less secure key expansion technique.

Do you think the largest online retailer in the world is paying the same credit card fees as everyone else. No, they are paying the absolute minimum in terms of card fees.
Handling Bitcoin may be very cheap from a fees perspective but at the moment it requires more support staff when things go wrong with Bitcoin payments. Things often go wrong because of the lack of a robust payment infrastructure which supports issues of overpayment, underpayment, currency volatility and issuing refunds. Bitpay charges $3000 a month but they offload the problems of overpayment, underpayment and paying beyond their 15minute cut-off onto the retailer which can add significant costs.

What problem does SETI solve?
The problem with using algorithms other than pointless proof of work schemes must have (1) a mechanism of measuring the difficulty of the problems, (2) making the problems harder or easier and (3) making the problems such that no part of them can be computed in advance. 
The first two are possible to solve to some degree but the third point making it not computable in advance of the previous block is difficult. Anything which can't be precomputed surely can't have any worth because we are solving things that 10 minutes ago we didn't know that this problem needed to be solved. This is a fundamental sticking point. Primecoin for example seems to find meaningful primes but in fact the prime numbers it generates have no worth to science or maths.
The solution to this problem might be [proof of burn]( in which we don't need to expend energy mining but instead we simulate the mining process using a much computationally efficient process, whether it works in practise is debatable.

The idea of transactions signed by both parties is a good idea except for one problem. It would require both parties to be online at the same time. Satoshi decided that payments should be able to be made without the recipient signing. It was a major decision but he reasoned that such double signing could be added in protocols on top of bitcoin such as the proposed payment protocol.
 Even with double signatures coins can be lost but without them systems like proof of burn and puzzle transactions can be implemented.

Well currently there is no pressure on bitcoin, the price isn't going up so there's not much incentive for new people to invest, at the same time most people invested in bitcoin continue to believe in it so there's no incentive for them to sell.

Well we're currently running 20nm technology and I think we can probably get down to about a 5nm process so that's about 20 times more efficient. If we exclude capital costs that means we can get power down to about 0.1W/Ghash. Electricity costs about 0.1$ per kWh. Current miner revenue is about 3 million $ per day. At this price you could purchase 30 million kWh of electricity which is about 1GW of electricity This gives a hashing power of 1x10^19 hashes per second (10 exahashes). Current difficulty is about 15 petahashes so difficulty could increase by about a factor of 1000.

Essentially, preventing governments or indeed anyone from messing with it. Bitcoin is designed to create consensus between decentralized parties so nobody can be in charge.
The whitepaper addresses mostly the technical details and a little about the applications of bitcoin but it doesn't go into the monetary details. I would strongly recommend you read it.
Bitcoin isn't designed to fight inflation, it was designed to be like gold so it has characteristics of a commodity rather than a currency. This can be good over the long run but bad in the short run. Compare the [price of a dollar]( with the [price of gold]( you can see that while the dollar has inflated slowly and is worth 30x less over the last century, the ratio between the highest and lowest gold price over the last century is about 10x. However over just a few years gold's price can shoot up and down.

How would we identify malicious actors, how would we communicate this to all nodes in a secure and decentralised way? What are the short term effects of a 51% attack, would it have long term effects?
I think the biggest threat comes from either the US, Taiwanese or Chinese governments banning the manufacture of bitcoin ASICs except where they are being supplied to the government.

This makes a little mores sense but it still doesn't explain how things happen. "If this doesn't agree with everyone else's copy of the data, then the host is penalized and removed from the network." So how does everyone else agree. I mean in bitcoin it takes 1 hour for everyone to agree. How does the agreement process work and how do people get removed?
In fact I don't really want you to answer that, I want you to go back and rewrite the whitepaper so it actually makes some sense. If you can't technically achieve something or there are problems then admit to this in the whitepaper. So you should say " the host is penalized and removed from the network however we haven't yet devised a scheme which is able to do this because of the tradeoff between this and this, the best we can currently do is this"

It is a bug unfortunately if you wish to do some more advanced things with bitcoin. For example you may wish to reference a future transaction that you haven't revealed yet in a transaction that you wish to send to the network now. If it is possible for someone to fiddle with my future transaction so its transaction id changes then the reference in the other transaction refers to a non existent entity.

Nick Szabo almost certainly isn't Satoshi. Here is my reasoning:
- Juola &amp; Associates, (text analysis experts) have ruled out that Szabo could be Satoshi according to [this forbes article](
- My fairly amateur analysis of their punctuation on [Szabo's blog]( and [Staoshi's forum posts]( Satoshi always places the period inside the parentheses ".)" when he places a whole sentences inside them whereas Szabo places it outside ")." The number of instances of this occurring is unfortunately too low to be conclusive.
- Whilst [Szabo has a degree in computer science from Washington University]( there is no evidence of him producing any C++ code. [Szabo's code commenting style]( is very different from Satoshi's.
- Satoshi said very little in the way of expressing political and cultural views whereas Szabo had done [extensive research into the history of money](
- Satoshi reckoned [micropayments were possible with bitcoin]( whereas Szabo argued that they [require too much mental calculation to be feasible](
- Satoshi stated ["I'm better with code than with words though."]( whereas Szabo is clearly [very good with words](

There isn't currently a way to do this automatically but here are two possible manual solutions:
You could have a 4 of 4 multi signature pay to script hash address (an address starting in a 3).
Basically this means all 4 of the coders have to sign a transaction to get their money out. So as long as the outgoing transaction is split 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% they will all agree to sign it and everyone will be happy.
Another method is to ask donors to use a random number generator to generate a number from 0 to 9. If it is 0 to 3 donate to address 1, 4 to 6 to address 2, 7 or 8 to address 3 and 9 to address 4. This would work if there are many donations being given.

Good question, in normal use you won't see either your public or private keys. Your bitcoin address is derived from your public key, it is shorter than a public key and contains some error checking to prevent you sending bitcoin to the wrong address. 
The private key is what allows you to spend your bitcoins. You must never show your private key to anyone else. Your private key is what is stored in your wallet.dat (in fact a collection normally 100 private keys are stored in the wallet) Your wallet is encrypted with a very secure encryption scheme. It is unnecessary to further encrypt it.

I'm afraid your page does unfortunately deserve to be deleted. Its an interesting and informative piece however it is original research and that isn't allowed on wikipedia.
You can't write a wikipedia article and then go and find academic sources to back up your point of view. You first find all your sources and then write about it based solely on those sources. There doesn't currently exist any academic work on the topic of Decentralized Autonomous Corporations.
Personally I would take your work and add it to the bitcoin wiki instead 
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:05:04
They are fundamentally different products. With blockchain, you have the key to access your wallet. If you lose your password blockchain can't help you.
With coinbase, your bitcoins are stored in a combination of their secure offline wallet and a hot online wallet. They basically secure your bitcoins for you and they can help you if you lose your password etc.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:03:42
True, but the developers public key could also be changed. The security depends on the developers public key being well known and available through a non compromised medium. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:51:56
When you make transactions with bitcoin-qt it sends the change to a new address and updates the wallet file to save this new address. If you save your wallet file to a USB stick and then make a transaction, the wallet file on your USB stick won't have the right address. Just wait till you get home.

How is bitcoin predictable and deflationary when deflation can only occur through increased demand (not predictable) and people losing bitcoins (also not predictable)  I don't understand.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:00:10
Coin simply records the magnetic signature of existing magnetic strip cards.
A bitcoin private key could be put onto a magnetic strip type card but it would be fairly insecure; if the user loses the card, say goodbye to the bitcoins. Also the POS manufacturer would have to design completely new software. Currently paying using Bitcoin and a QR code on a screen is just as convenient and much more secure. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:36:11

The QR code is the most well known representation of a bitcoin in my opinion. Something like this is pretty cool 
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:59:53
Its a nice idea but the app would have to be connected to the receiving persons wallet such that the receiver would have access to the private key corresponding to that bitcoin address. I can't see this becoming a widely used piece of software due to the security problem you mentioned. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:27:44
Its a great idea! I like it a lot. 
Unfortunately I do have some reservations. This will be very difficult to make with current metal 3D printing technologies. You just won't be able to build the gap between the upper and lower layers without some form of support structure. I would love to be mistaken but I worked in a company setting up metal 3D printers and we had more than enough trouble making pieces which were much simpler than this. 
Also, the 3D printing company workers will be able to see the private key.

ASICs are relatively simple hardware wise and therefore inserting a back-door would be very noticeable. Back-doors are more likely to be introduced into the controllers, ie. the PCs which operate the ASICs and we already know the government has been doing that. Fortunately the controllers aren't very expensive and don't need to be high performance so they can be swapped for models which haven't been interfered with.

I read this as consumerist. Its a nice idea but auto-correct will kill it.

There's some interesting stuff here. One of the best bitcoin videos I've seen. Brian Armstrong has a very clear understanding of the whole Bitcoin market from the economics to the infrastrcuture and the future vision. He's very measured and realistic about the future of bitcoin.

A great survey and write-up. Thanks for organising the survey.
I'm surprised how strongly male dominated bitcoins are and also how many people have mined bitcoins at some point. Almost as many people have mined bitcoins as have purchased something with them. And there is also a good proportion of people who have bitcoins but haven't used them to purchase anything.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:23:38

I presume you are in the UK so I would recommend buying on [localbitcoins]( I would probably advise you to buy in smaller chunks, maybe £1000 at a time. I bought my bitcoins there using a standard UK bank transfer and it worked perfectly well. 
You will probably want to transfer most of these bitcoins to a paper wallet. Look up how to create one securely, there are lots of guides. Your paper wallet should be kept in a secure place; a waterproof and fireproof safe is best. Then I would recommend transferring a small amount to an online wallet like [blockchain.info]( so that you can spend some bitcoins.

I meant imagine an alternate reality in which Satoshi instead of creating Bitcoin created a coin called Decaycoin which randomly removes money from peoples accounts.

The difficulty isn't always increasing, it increases or decreases so as to keep blocks being created at a rate of 1 every 10 minutes. This will continue regardless of how many bitcoins are mined. The only thing which affects it is the bitcoin network's hash rate.
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:40:10
Personal advice: don't mine.
At the moment the profit margins are slim and it requires a good amount of knowledge and time to get a good setup working. Bitcoin mining is increasingly becoming a professional large scale industry.
Bitcoin mining is today done by ASICs (as an electrical engineer you should know this stands for application specific integrated circuit) Its a chip that just does sha-256 hashing very quickly but nothing else so it is extremely efficient compared to a CPU or GPU. On the order of a million times more efficient than a CPU.
Secondly don't trust Butterfly Labs. People have had so many issues with them in the past. KNCMiner  is probably the best company at the moment.

If the whole world used only bitcoins as a currency, around 1-5% of the global economy would be made up of bitcoin miners, just because it would be economically profitable to do so. In some ways, the bitcoin network is staggeringly wasteful but in other ways its quite efficient given that around 15% of the US economy is made up of banking and financial services.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:01:21
That is only 2% so its not massive. Also other bitcoin clients allow you to set much lower or no fees. A new fees structure is currently being investigated by the developers to reduce the default fees.

Thats actually not true. The ASICs do double-SHA-256 on a fixed length integer and increment a nonce. Passwords just use single SHA-256 and are variable length.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:04:22
Another contradiction here, with bitcoin you never know how many wallet keys have been lost, so by your definition the rate of inflation is not fixed. At least with dollars the federal reserve does know how many dollars they have created.

So now can we stop pretending Bitcoin has value solely because of its transaction system/payment network. It also has value because of its limited supply which leads to increasing prices with increased demand just like the tulip bubble. (I'm not saying that Bitcoin is a bubble just that it does share the limited supply characteristics)
@_date: 2013-12-15 16:22:56
Currently bitcoin is not optimised for micro-payments. The fees are fixed regardless of the amount transferred to prevent a large volume of low value transactions clogging up the network. If you can think of a more appropriate way of getting around this issue then get in touch with the developers. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:43:32
Ok, I understand now, that is sensible. 
I'll be interested to see what you get back. Do you know which orientation it is being printed in the machine and what the tolerances are between the two layers? I can sort of see how it might be printed standing on its edge but the tolerances between the two layers would have to be quite large.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:59:00
I know nobody pays. But if we think about this from first principles the miners are paying electricity bills and somebody is supplying electricity to run the mining rigs. That energy isn't created out of nothing. The real cost of running the bictoin network is around 5M USD per day.
When miners get block rewards it devalues everyone else's bitcoins equivalent to every bitcoin holder paying a small transaction fee proportional to how much they hold.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:14:33
Technically transactions take 6 confirmations normally 1 hour to become official however most people accept unconfirmed transactions of less than $100. That means it takes just a few seconds to process but there is a very small risk someone could steal from you. In practise this doesn't happen because you would need to have a sophisticated set-up to reverse an unconfirmed transaction.

In my dictionary "Inflation: a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money"

Its extremely difficult to setup because you physically have to buy bitcoins from an exchange.

Most new altcoins use scrypt specifically so they can't be attacked by powerful ASICs used in bitcoin mining.

Ok, by your definition its deflationary but its not predictably deflationary because people loose their bitcoins at random.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:47:23
Its a nice presentation. I would personally add in a little about some of the more advanced future implications of bitcoins. Eg. how they can be used in multi-signature transactions and time limited transaction, smart payments and escrow services. Thats what I am personally most excited about.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:56:51
I think you need to understand how Visa and cheques work. Visa cards only work if you pay Visa to process the transaction, so that rather defeats the point of using bitcoin with it. Cheques are only valid if they are issued by a reputable bank or credit union which again defeats the point of bitcoin.

What I guess I'm trying to say is that Bitcoin is currently using more capital to maintain the system per transaction than other payment networks such as paypal. Its currently not very efficient but I realise that with more transactions and lower block rewards in the future, this cost should drop significantly. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:38:33
Use the address rather than a QR code on websites. QR codes are designed for physical objects where you can't select the text or click on a link.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:46:31
Mainly because it takes time and a fair amount of capital to create a product as good as coinbase. There is currently uncertainty regarding government legislation and it is tough to obtain a conventional bank account to run a Bitcoin business. Combined these factors mean there is little incentive to invest in such a business especially when you could just buy some Bitcoins and reap the rewards from its price increase.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:29:38

@_date: 2013-12-16 01:02:50
The math is both correct and wrong. You can't equate income to savings. In the future, cash flow may be much faster so people may have high incomes but low savings.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:53:54
Ok so by your definition bitcoin is inflationary, supply has been constantly increasing since it was created. I would say bitcoin has gone through periods of deflation and inflation but predominantly hyper-deflation.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:48:47
Whatever, I don't really care. I care about price increases and economic growth, not how much dollar liquidity has been created.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:25:28
Ok that makes sense I guess. Somewhat counter-intuitive though, bitcoin has value because bitcoin holders are charging new entrants to enter the market. Even though without those new entrants there would be very few merchants and therefore no real way of using the currency.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:36:00
Put your bitcoin address in the video description. Its a lot easier clicking a link or selecting some text, than scanning the QR code in with another device or a screenshot.

@_date: 2013-12-11 00:43:47
Its smart if you believe other people will do the same as you. The price of bitcoin and litecoin is more due to speculation and not really how much they are used for real transactions.

@_date: 2013-12-14 15:53:17
First come up with an idea for a business, then you can scrutinise what areas of law it might fall under. If you offer a service for bitcoins which does not involve any form of medical, legal or financial product (investment, insurance, escrow, wallet services, exchanging) does not involve areas of questionable legality, drugs, alcohol, pornography, gambling etc, is only available to users in the same jurisdiction as you are, does not except user submissions (uploading content) and would generally be viewed as a good service or product by most people then you shouldn't have too much to worry about except paying taxes correctly.

It sounds like you've opened up a wallet which isn't up to date. Theres not much you can do except go back to your original wallet and make an up to date copy. Bitcoin-qt isn't designed to use on multiple computers.

Can you explain why the payment system aspect makes the currency valuable. Imagine an altcoin which works in the same way as bitcoin but randomly removes money from peoples accounts with a half life of say a week. Would this currency have the same value as bitcoin?
I personally don't think so because it would become a poor store of value even though the payment aspect is identical to bitcoin. If it were only the payment system which gives the currency value then this altcoin would be worth the same amount as bitcoin.
In reality the amount of real transactions in bitcoin is very low. 6000 bitpay transactions on Black Friday means I estimate sales of the order of $1M USD per day. This suggests bitcoin has a velocity of around 0.3/year which is fairly slow and suggests its convenience as an asset is the reason for its value.

You won't be able to find big wallets using SHA-256 collisions only poorly salted SHA-256 hashed passwords. Even if flaws are found in SHA-256 it seems unlikely that they be exploitable for many many years to come.

Thank God!
6,000 orders out of the hundreds of thousands of people who have bitcoins is not an impressive figure. Hyper-deflation has increased the number of bitcoin owners due to its investment potential but it has meant that spending of bitcoins has been hampered. People would rather hold onto their bitcoins than spend them. Some people seem to say, buying bitcoins in dollars in order to spend them shows you can get around the problem of deflation. But that is because you're buying in with your traditional slightly inflating currency which you get paid in. If you were paid in bitcoins you'd be doing a lot more saving and less spending.

To spend bitcoins you have to know the private key. If you don't trust yourself with the key then you have to trust someone else and that someone else can get hacked and then some thief has your private key.
Keys however can be split up so you can be trusted with part of it and somebody else with the other part. So you could split your key into say 5 pieces, of which you need 4 of those pieces to reconstruct the key. Then you give those parts to 4 online services and keep the remaining part. This means that if one part of the system fails, your key won't be lost but an attacker has to compromise all 4 online services to get your key to be able to use it.

Could you tell us the methodology for the score on question 15?

Am I right in saying the insurance would only pay out if your company loses my bitcoins. If a thief manages to compromise my password, hardware and cell phone and thereby transfer out my bitcoin to their account then the insurance wouldn't pay out.

Unfortunately there are no real facts about bitcoin ownership due to their pseudonymous nature.
I would estimate there are around 5 million bitcoin users. (Based on mywallet users   ) and around 5 million circulating bitcoins if we ignore the ones that Satoshi mined and those that have been lost forever. That means the average bitcoin user has about 1 bitcoin. This is an order of magnitude approximation.

Tell us the address you are sending to or the transaction id. It may be that multibit is not able to connect to the network. If it shows on blockchain.info chances are the transaction has occurred.
