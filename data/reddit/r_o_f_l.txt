Silver has intrinsic value tbf. Bitcoin has the same intrinsic value as chuck-e-cheese tokens

vs. reality
Don't worry guys, only 4 or 5 zeros to go until your "currency"/"store of value" is relevant

But if they weren't covering it fairly you guys would be like "CORPORATE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA PLOTTING TO DESTROY BITCOIN!!1 BILDEBERG GROUP PLANS COUP AGAINST ALL NON FIAT CURRECY"

I watched 2 people trash BCH on CNBC last week. They said it was basically centralized while Bitcoin isn't. I mean that's totally wrong, but my point is they said it.

Not sure if satire

Yeah that would all be true... If only bitcoin was a currency and not an extremely volatile commodity that has no creator and doesn't exist in the physical world. Oh and not to mention those mt gox people who occasionally rob you all blind only to be forgiven immediately after. If bitcoin is a currency it is the least secure currency in history. You people are a complete joke.

Currencies aren't supposed to go way up or way down. The same morons who keep calling bitcoin a currency keep saying that they are smart because the price is going to skyrocket. CURRENCIES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY. "Currency". Right.

Yeah but owning bitcoin is not the same as owning 'the idea of cryptocurrency' or the blockchain... The idea will never tank 50% but Bitcoin might

Wow bitcoin is so stable I'm going to invest right now!

But no regulation. Like currencies, subreddits can regulate themselves.
