Don't let other people handle your wallet for you. That is stupid.

I thought Doge was a joke until i joined. Doge is far better than other crypto
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:29:55
I can't wait till this crash starts to recover. I hope to buy at rock bottom then sell for doge once it goes up.

It was all done at an awards show they were all at. Just a fishing page on open WiFi that made you log into icloud to connect. Never use open WiFi without a vpn and never enter logon info to connect if asked. This want really hacking anyone's grandma could do it with a wifi pineapple.

Guys! This new thing called Doge will save you. Trade all your coins for doge before you lose more value!
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:52:43

As soon as Google wallet came along I close my PayPal account and never looked back. People who still use PayPal I look at as inferior beasts.
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:17:17
Doge would be better
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:18:21
After decades of a failed economy imagine is crypto saves them somehow. That would be a great headline.

This article gets way too political for me shock terms like "Muslim ban" etc turned me off. I don't see why we can't just report the facts about this it's definitely important news. I hate how all the news outlets are so political these days. Ultimately politics are garbage to the average man and they have to convince us that they matter in order to decide us and use us to spread their agendas. ;(

That comment sure is mature of you. Thanks for being so emotional about somthing that wont really matter.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:28:45
More emotional ad hominem attacks?
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:31:08
Electrum said it was high, from now on I'll decide that with other resources.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:14:09
Thanks for that
@_date: 2016-12-03 05:07:31
Wow you all sold out hard
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:10:37
Hope this scum is reported for violating the rules

Prepare for auto play sounds
@_date: 2012-10-09 15:08:45
the value isn't constantly appreciating
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:26:12
Are we headed up what do you think. I sold half at a slight gain yesterday expecting a dip today like I've been seeing recently. Buy back in with what I sold or wait for a big sell off?
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:48:26
I called em out a lot and wasn't blocked.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:24:29
Bitcoin is a good way to hold value, I think it's good how it is. We can use other crypto that are valued in btc to set a good standard.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:49:50
I bought back in it's not too much of a risk for me, less than 2k in crypto
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:07:31
How professional and mature of you :/
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:54:22
Dads are smart, not going to invest in betting that others will pay more in the future on something that has no real value is smart. Maybe some people get rich and take the risks but dads know better, good dads at least, play it safe to help their family.
