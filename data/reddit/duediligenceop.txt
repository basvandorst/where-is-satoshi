Pretty sure their compliance team wouldn't have let him buy if he were a terrorist/sex offender, but okay

+1 CTR, gracias. At the end of the day, their prices often beat Gemini and Coinbase prices, and BTFO P2P sketchfests, so it's shite that I have to wait a week for purchases

They stopped; turns out that acting like an exchange when you don't want to be one can only go on for so long, before you have to become a proper one and charge fees to mitigate fraud losses or cut it. 
Satoshi bless whatever service facilitates buying BTC without fees; fiat-to-crypto rails are too expensive (regulations, fraud, hiring people to manage the two) to warrant it at this point

Move them to your hardware wallet. You know how the old saying goes about controlling your private keys
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:28:15
Use cases and scale solutions are more important than price prediction posts.

I got the email too, just move your BTC to blockchain.info until this blows over. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:36:26
Harping about this like they're stealing your Bitcoin when they're telling you to get your Bitcoin to a place where you own the keys is a distraction. There are better discussions to have 
Anyone with coins still on Circle should just move them; obviously you don't have control of your keys on an exchange, so move them to Blockchain and strap your seatbelt for the rollercoaster
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:48:28
Blockchain.info gives you private keys, so do that, or any other service where you get your private keys
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:45:49
Literally google "blockchain Bitcoin wallet", make a wallet there, copy and paste a RECEIVE address you generated from Blockchain.info into the address field on Circle for where you want to send your Bitcoin.
I'm not a financial advisor and am too much a proponent for autonomy; please Google it and jot down tips on how to actively take care of your stores of value.

Sounds like:


But I have some filters installed on Chrome. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:40:55
So then the price needs to be driven by accessibility and scalability, correct?
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:17:00
Neat! Why isnt this a thing already? 
It seems like Airbitz's explanation is that the blocksize stays the same, but because of smaller transactions per block, more transactions can be fit per 1MB, correct?
@_date: 2017-01-23 07:20:54
This sub sparked a 1-star review train; what kind of precedent would they set if they brought back buying BTC after a tantrum like that?
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:13:34
 I'm not seeing what stops people from buying Bitcoin with stolen cards right now, nor am I seeing how de-risking chargeback fraud from crypto exchanges incentivizes people who commit fraud to do so more often with Bitcoin, as if a dispute hurts the thief. Would you mind educating me?
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:14:41
I'm confused; my question was how does de-risking chargeback fraud from crypto exchanges incentivize scammers to want to commit fraud? From what I understand, people can dispute debit card and ACH transactions from Bitcoin brokers as is, it's just a lot easier with a credit card. Additionally, none of that penalizes a fraudster, since they can just as well steal a debit card and do the same thing.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:00:11
Really bad OpSec on your part for getting caught? 
 Idk why Circle partnered with Coinbase for referrals, which exchange has the best availability on a state-by-state level, aside from LBC/paxful? 
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:51:30
Bitcoin isn't a company, so I don't think it can be assigned debt. Companies that support Bitcoin in developed countries are likely run into compliance costs. Also, there are fraud-induced losses from card transactions, since some people abuse buyer protections on fiat networks when buying Bitcoin. Would it be good if we could lobby for people to be unable to dispute cryptocurrency purchases, assuming that lowered the risk associated with it?
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:50:02
A lot of libertarians like it; some people like the fact that you can potentially dodge taxes with Bitcoin, and buy whatever drug/poker chips you want. The arguments against paying taxes usually neglect calls for better tax revenue allocation.
Arguably, good press for Bitcoin would be contributing to projects that devolop international internet access for developing countries. That way, things could be more decentralized
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:36:02
Carders aren't effected by chargeback fraud either way. From what I understand, carding as a crime is designed so that every facet of the account doesn't tie to the carder proper, so even if they tried to find the person the exchange would find that someone else's identity was used to sign up for an account. 
CNP fraud is different from not arresting shoplifters; what are the real-lifr penalties for carding on a Bitcoin exchange (assuming they didn't steal cards from person A to make an account with person B's identity)?

They probably won't claim the BCC, and if they do it's a waste of time for lazy speculators who deliberately avoided reading a tutorial on private key management. 
Anyone who suddenly cared about Bitcoin Cash based on Reddit/BTCTalk/Twitter buzz about the pump, but acted too irresponsible to move their keys out in the weeks before August 1st (this fork was at least a month coming) put this on themselves. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:50:45
Source? Circle telling people to buy with CB (and sneakily adding their own referral link) is very different from them sharing information and compliance procedures
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:17:49
If someone unwittingly bought Bitcoin from the hacker, they'll probably end up getting a SAR filed on them haha
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:18:38
Ironically enough, I could have sworn I saw a thread where someone sent from Korbit to Circle. Maybe reach out to Korbit/ Circle support about this?

Aside from the price performance, what makes Bitcoin more alive than the shitpost obituaries journalists have written in the past?
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:21:31
This headline is votebait; the most recent article about the Nigerian Central Bank indicates that they're blocking all digital currency transations, not just Bitcoin. 
Considering that MMM and OneCoin-esque Ponzi schemes are prevalent out there, it's a logical decision if a bank knows nothing about the difference between Bitcoin and OneCoin. I feel like there should be a means for a crypto-knowledgable group to establish a point of contact with officials in Nigeria, so that banks can understand Bitcoin and better block scams. Otherwise, they'll take whatever E-coin Visa doles out.
 On another note, no central bank can comment on the appeal of get-rich-quick schemes without making their country look like a shite place to live

The price is down, exchange volumes are lower than I've ever seen them, and they're bored. Perfect storm for a brigade.
On the bright side, no other company will ever make BTC-fiat liquidity as easy as Circle did, and every post like this makes r/Bitcoin look more and more distant from reality haha
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:42:58
[I wonder how they came to that conclusion. I mean, they must have the best compliance team in the hemisphere.](

Does SegWit mean less fixed fees for miners, when compared to bigger blocksizes?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:00:17
Marketing and shilling. Many Bitcoiners are libertarians who won't lift a finger unless you send micropayments for each Joule of energy spent

Courage, Certainty, and Confidence post? Seems like the opposite of FUD, but still a shitpost

It's probably a Travel Rule request, which is triggered for volume over 3k in a week (Google it). Most licensed MSBs are required to at least ask, in case someone comes knocking and it turns out you (or someone else) is a money launderer. Nowadays that doesn't take much BTC.
You can answer it, or don't; they'll probably tell you to move your money out since your tinfoiling puts them in a weird position legally, and I'm surprised they haven't forced all BTC holders off at this point. I genuinely doubt they give a shit who you are, or what addresses are yours, but more often than not they just need a response from you on file for legal purposes. I sure as shit wouldn't say to lie, because that's kinda pointless, but do whatever makes you feel important

Giving new meaning to the "I did not authorize these deposits over the last 88 days equalling $10000. I bet online, but have never heard of [insert workaround shell company/Bitcoin exchange used to fund bad bets]. I demand a refund" script.
 If anyone has ever wondered why fees are stupid high, it's volatility and chargeback risk. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:10:21
They're supposed to charge you money for chargebacks; card networks charge them when your shit customers chargeback because fraud makes their network look bad, and they need to recover their losses from high-chargeback services like yours. 
On another note, your service literally asks for chargebacks, because most of the harassing men from other dating sites will pay whatever minimum, harass a dozen girls, and then dispute the transactions no matter what
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:37:36
Yes. Both companies can accumulate value, both in the form of assets under management and in valuation, if that's what you're asking.

Something something MITM scams scammer contacts you wanting to buy BTC, sets up means of receiving and send address, then contacts me telling me they want to sell some. They route my money to you, take the BTC and run off, IIRC

3rd party id checkers and exchanges don't play with that foo foo lame shit. If you want to put on a digital President mask and buy Bitcoin, use a local exchange and pay the premium

He's giving OP a choice: either stay at Tier 2, or submit an ID in a way that doesn't make their risk team think he's defrauding them with a stolen identity. That's a lot more patience than you'd see from most CS workers in crypto exchanges who probably see fraudsters raise hell for being shut down.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:24:36
What objective measure qualifies a company to be bolded? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:46:59
Surprisingly enough, I think Korbit allows you to send money (even Bitcoin) to Circle, where you can withdraw in Fiat. Definitely ask Korbit/Circle about it though

That sucks; I emailed them about 5 days ago about an L2 typo and an l3 submission. I got my response within a day
