Go to the BitInstant support thread on bitcointalk.org . I had the same issue last week. After 4 days of waiting and 6 emails to customer support they didn't even respond to me once. I posted a few times on their support thread and finally they fixed my issue but I lost out on a huge price surge and they didn't even refund their transaction fees. Extreme incompetence in their business practices. From now on I'm just using Bitfloor.

It's a bubble but hard to tell if this is the top

Since 1 already exists I'd say we need 2

The codes are active for between 24 hours and 48 hours from when they are generated. Did you post the code before this time frame? BitInstant support is completely incompetent and they are at fault for stating in their email that "your funds have been automatically deposited and no code is needed". They are liable for your money and if they don't give it to you you can take legal action. BitInstant should also be able to work with MtGox to find the user and IP address of the person that redeemed your code, and could likely identify them with some time.

told you so

Not a scam, but I'm pretty sure that taking 5 days to process funds and not answering a single email while guaranteeing 1 hour service means they are completely incompetent.

I spent all my bitcoins on SR (for books) a few hours before the crash... all of my orders are still processing. Unfortunately, even though I placed them before the crash they will probably be canceled by SR or the vendors because the price wasn't updated for ~14 hours and still is double the current value on BTC-E.
My intuition to spend my coins at the $240 was correct but I still got fucked.

Do you accept instant money gram?

I have this EXACT same case for a backup computer
