The greed is strong on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:21:47
It's like creating an email address, using it for years, close that account, open a new one. 100$ was just an example and is meant as the balance, not the fee. You can spend those 100 dollars (if fiat will still be in
Dollars) or whatever equivalent and reload money later..

What crash?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:04:01
How did this happen? Who was the  address holder?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:16:26
He shills what makes him more money, pretty obvious he was getting money from Roger or Jihad to shill that shitcoin. McAfee officially shills coins for money... So I guess it's like it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:31:05
No risk, no fun.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:39:59
Long time no see
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:43:02
So, which address was used to collect his bitcoin. Pretty sure the BTC was quickly converted into fiat and was not administered by him. Sounds more like some marketing gag to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:16:08
Uplifting news!
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:24:51
Why not now? 0,01 BTC for $100 - that's not a bad deal at all.
Wow, that was a short ama

If you want to mine, check out vertcoin.org/ r/vertcoin or other alts which are mineable with GPU or even CPU (r/myriadcoin) - you can mine it with GPU - bitcoin is impossible to mine without ASIC.

That what's happening in a young market full of weak hands. People who bought and are selling now are burning money. This is a known game, you need to understand, otherwise you lose your money to whales. There is a reason for a sticky on bitcoin sub, telling not to invest recklessly...

It's a shame that there are student debts. Congrats to free yourself from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:52:09
The student is the tax payer of tomorrow - he is the 'somebody'. If the educational system is not covered by taxes, something went in the wrong direction. Also it gives people with money a better starting point, people from poor families are held back from studying. The education of the people should be totally backed by the country you are living in. It's crazy that you have to get a credit to go to study, to find a job to pay back this credit the next 10 or twenty years.
It's working like this in European countries like Germany, France and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:18:09
There are no taxes on bitcoins in some countries after a year, eg. Germany.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:39:50

@_date: 2019-07-12 09:57:38
HODL on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:37:15
I just wanted to point out, that not only high fees are the problem Steam needs to struggle is, but also volatility as mentioned in their statement - read the comments on r/btc. 
My posting was also removed from the MainSub - so much about censorship on r/btc.... They don't want to have facts over there. It's r/the_donald of cryptoworld and they don't see this. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:08:35
This is so old. Why are you running through the vanished ruins of Reddit.
There is a big difference between a gift card - infinite vs coin - finite supply. With lightning tech it would make sense, as you could use those coins in the BTC universe via swap. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:49
It's also rising. We had this before. This is what hodl really means, it's not just a meme slogan.

@_date: 2017-12-01 12:03:49
Could have been worse. Haven't watched the show since years. The negative, typical things they said about bitcoin, like you can't spend it, fake money, etc. was said in a flashback 7 years ago when they started mining and didn't knew how it would develop. 
The story was very poorly written and not funny nor really about the idea behind bitcoin. Would have been so easy to write a good episode about it. But well.... The show is not made to educate people. Nevertheless funny to see bitcoin in a mainstream TV show. 
Exposure is needed for the masses.
And all started with the first block...
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:28:45
haha -- ha aha ahahaa lol rofl 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:56:05
What if the normal Amazon customer could buy finite Amazon coin via credit card and use this coin inside the BTC universe, without the need of using an exchange for instance... Lightning network will open up endless new possibilities. I am not saying that I want an Amazon coin, don't get me wrong. Just want to look at mass adaptation and have some mind experiments...

At first it was great, so what?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:39:10
it's hard for their business model to do so. On one day, it could be worth a million, on the other maybe just 900.000k - this is too volatile - and this is the problem. If I was Gabe, I would absolutely take btc! It's just the uncertainty for the business right now - in both directions. Dollar is easier to calculate and to plan. Hmmm.... and maybe who knows, they got a little hint, that there maybe some things are planned from the goevernment concerning cryptos and businesses? (just an idea)

there you can see how much fee really is needed to come into the next block, if you can wait a few hours, a lower fee is fine, as long as it is not too low.

As you have only invested what you are willing to lose in worst case, as preached in this sub, you can just relax. It will go up again.
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:55:10
it's rooted. So I guess this is an insecure way. Is there a PC version you could recommend?
What do you think about paypal-  sending someone 10 Euros - waiting to get back the amount in BTC on my wallet, next time 10 Euros, wating for the BTC amount to arrive and so on... - so the risk to be scammed is lower, isn't it?

that's one reason to stay private on reddit or the web as much as you can - never use your real name in your reddit user name... I mean, the world is full of freaks. When you have a Facebook Account, posting family images it can happen, that those people have more informations about you - This is really a lesson for all people who think "we have nothing to hide". I can just advise to everybody - don't share your life with the world. All the best and good luck -  really stop sharing your life with the world - it is something to protect - because it makes you vulnerable when somebody wants to play games. good luck!

@_date: 2017-03-10 11:13:49
I think both decisions will be alright. People acting like that bitcoin is dependent on the ETF decision. I think both will be fine. An approval will rush money in the market and BTC gets mainstream quicker. A rejection will not make BTC worse - maybe the opposite will happen. People might think - wow interesting - BTC works but it is not approved by SEC - I will buy in.... etc. So I am confindent with both decisions. Now - go to bed and sleep. ;)

I always thought that this cap and bitcoin don't fit together. It implicates, that we need a Trump to make something 'great again' - while bitcoin is not needed to 'get great again'. Also it is a Hitler Slogan 'I make Germany great again' - and why 'usa great again'? When was it great, that we need a old version of it? 70s, 80s, 90s? What times wants Trump to bring back?

bitnodes for instance shows how many nodes are running. Bitcoin is running since years - without (big) problems - it works. There is a lot in the making regarding all the blockchain debate. E.g. lightning network, SegWit, etc.

yes - that's my understanding. 
Here is something more about it:

A miner actually produces bitcoin, while a node helps the network to work, without producing btc or get paid. It is just a helper to support the transaction flow. Mining is very difficult, expensive nowadays and makes almost no sense for the average user.  You could mine btc on your cpu/gpu in its very early days.

@_date: 2017-03-29 16:36:26
Easier, yes, maybe - you would just need to open the 8333 ports. But where is the fun? And Raspi runs almost without consuming energy - no noise at all. It  runs here 24/7 - not one problem.

The most interesting part for me was to show the way to get a pruned blockchain transfered from PC to another device, as I was reading that most people were using the raspberry to also download and sync the whole blockchain, which took very long and would need 20x times more space and I think it stopped people building up a node at all. It stopped me building one, until I found out about pruning.

Pruning is the interesting part. Just starting bitcoind would mean downloading and validating 120GB of data. Which takes forever on a raspi. With pruned data you save a lot of time setting up a raspi.

I am almost running a raspberry3 full node 0.13, currently still syncing the blockchain on PC with 0.13 - what is the best way to update 0.13 on the raspi, do I have to compile 0.14 on the raspi or can I just Git it and make install? Do I have to set anything else up on the raspi, to speed up the syncing or to use one of the new features? I read there is a way to reduce the blockchain size (pruning) - how can I activate it? Thx

I pruned the blockchain on my desktop machine now - and copied chainstate and blocks onto the raspberry in .bitcoin folder - when I start I am getting the message:
You need to rebuild the database using -reindex to go back to unpruned mode.  This will redownload the entire blockchain.
Please restart with -reindex or -reindex-chainstate to recover.
So I guess, there is something wrong. But what. When I was downloading the blockchain to PC, I needed to add an external drive to save the blockchain to had this in my config file. 
On Raspberry I had rpcuser in bitcoin.conf
But even when I used the same config values as on my machine, getting the same error message. 
!! edit: got working now! I had the bitcoin.conf inside bin/bitcoin instead of .bitcoin - this solved the problem!
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:12:00

Roubini is ignorant and arrogant. He does not understand how bitcoin works. He always uses the same arguments: exchanges are not decentralised. When you try to explain that exchanges are not the most important part / or really needed of the whole system he says 'ah cmon' every time. It's a waste of time to discuss with him about bitcoin.
Also he never heard about lightning. He still comes with the 'only 5 transactions per second' argument. Cmon.

There really should exist something like a opensource piNode distro which is completely setup to run as a node, so even noobs could put it on a sdcard, put it in the pi, turn it on, decide if full node or node, enter the ports, putting the blockchain on (download or from external to speed up the syncing). I think this would push a lot of new nodes out there. I have a pi3 and I defenitley would turn it into a node. But I am not 100% sure to make it 100% safe and secure to run. Anybody knows if this already exists or anybody interested in creating a distro like this? 
Needed to start:
* A pi for $30 or the new asus pi thing.
* A sdcard 128gb for $20
Electricity and internet.
A node for 50bucks.
This is a nice tut:
I read that you can sync/dl the blockchain on your pc and transfer it back to the sd or external usb drive to speed up the 30 days it would take letting the raspi doing it to a few hours.

If bitcache really works without a catch this could be great...for bitcoin and any other segwit coin (atomic swaps) to reach main stream. Not sure if google gives a go to put bitcache under the videos officially but I think this could work and a mainstream payment channel for digital goods is needed and we have tools to make it happen. Same for journalism. If it will be possible to tip small amounts like cents/ satoshis without fee this could work. I guess with upcoming lightning network we will see more services like bitcache soon. Exciting times with or without dotCom.

Maybe CNY makes the market right now, but at the moment it looks like many people in the western world see more benefits in bitcoin than just 'hiding' money from the government. So they buy their first coins right now. The price drop is not really bad or much. It's tiny atm. And a correction needed to happen sooner or later anyways. So for the current situation the btc is still on a good way. But the best news: it's not BTC's fault or an exchange's because it got hacked or something. BTC as technology is still golden.

In US they legalised marijuana for recreational use. So stocks like cann (e.g. general cannabis) could skyrocket in 2017 - but it's just speculation. Those stocks were penny stocks because the mj market was not really regulated. Last year the stock went from a few pennies to $4 in a year. And it was at $40 back in 2013 in the first 'green rush'. Search for marijuana stocks and you see whatbI am talking about. The market has been now officially been legalised.

Another difference is LTC, has no "bitcoin" inside its name. That's maybe a reason why people don't understand that it is also is related to / can work with bitcoin, and they don't see that Litecoin already has more to offer than bch.

Lightning network is still in the making. There are still a lot of problems needing to be solved. But nevertheless, I believe in this technology. When you need a third party you can already buy games on steam in just 10seconds via bitcoin - not anonymously, but effective. So I think in day to day usage it won't make any problems. Services need to be developed. We are still in a very early stage of digital currencies. Massadaption will take some time. But the sooner you get envolved with it, the better. Digital Money will come, if the major form is bitcoin or an alt coin - who knows?

tell everyone to get 1 or 1+ bitcoins - so the demand will rise drastically. At the moment 16.000.000 coins are created - which means, that only 16.000.000 people can own one bitcoin right now (less, as many coins were lost in the beginning). This is really something everybody should be aware of. I am telling everyone to get just at least 1BTC - since years. People need to understand that you don't need to spend "one" coin at once, but that there are many more units like satoshis and mbtc etc.
So if you don't have at least one bitcoin, get one asap :). And tell everyone to get one, too! 
Happy 2017

I would actively create a small test transaction with e.g. mycelium in their phone wallets and try to make them understand how this works - including the security issues and how to solve them (write down pass phrase, keep it secure). If they don't know btc for now and are not interested in it by now, it can be seem very abstract. If they are open to it, try to make them understand what this really means.
I talked a lot about btc to family members and I found out, that the easiest way to make them understand btc better, is to let them try it out with mBTC, just to see how these transactions work.
So I asked them to install a wallet like mycelium, asked for the address and sent a very small test amount. As soon as they saw something happening in their wallet, they understood, that this works. And they even could send mbtc back. I think the greatest gift for young people is education and knowledge about something that 99% percent of their generation don't know about yet.

I'd also say, that MtGox was a main reason for the crash. But it wasn't Bitcoins fault. People thought btc was hacked, but it was just the marketplace.

Btc has a good, trustworthy standing, as it was never hacked in the times of existence...

I think so too. When you are buying btc the way we are used to do it is cheaper, when you buy bitcoin via a 'bank controlled' system like cc, it's easier to people who don't know the technology yet, so I can understand a slightly higher price when buying via cc.

This is important to have kept in mind, as this clearly shows, how much time it took to get the tcp/ip standard established. Almost 20 years! And the www was introduced even later... and yes, like others said - bitcoin is the thing, blockchain is "just" a decentralised"database.

I have no idea, as im the noob. But: Sell it, when it gives you a better feeling.
 And maybe hold 1btc for future. Don't buy in falling, that's too dangerous. 
And the next time be careful, as it will only make you feel sad as you regret it. Just be careful. Read some people's advice here with similar situations and learn. Good luck.

Exactly. I think in general people - even people never heard about bitcoin before - now have heard of it. So the interest in bitcoin and crypto currencies in general may rise. Even older generations read about bitcoin in the news. So digital currencies in general could get more attention now.

I am wondering about the crazy price rise. There will be some things happen, that will lead to a crazy rollercoaster(bull trap) soon - in my opinion. I mean, there's nothing to get really thrilled about. Far away from any consensous or am I totally blind? Of course, Japan jumped in (happened before with other countries, too), bitmain was maybe using AsicBoost, etc. But what is going on right now? Why are people pumping so much money in btc atm while FUD couldn't be any higher.... 
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:56:47
yeah - I guess it is... I don't know exactly why the price is rising that fast....

I also think paper wallets have a great educational value too, as people have something physical to work with. Something very abstract for noobs at first, but something they immedeately understand 10minutes later. Also the differences between public key and private key are shown nicely. I remeber some page where you could preload vouchers, but can't remember  the url. Actually, a paperwallet acts the same with both keys in your control. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:08:49

Sure, the message is huge - but ever heard of "buying the rumor, selling the news"? The problem is, that there is still a lot to work on and this is not the right time for (more) euphoria than normal. In the next month there will be a solution, of course - but right now, it is just a very dangerous zone, as you don't know who is trying to melk the market right now. It is a bullish whale market - the worst of its kind. So just be careful.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:13:01
No - I don't think it is bad at all. It's great to see that the btc market gets bigger and that Japan regulates the payment. But this is nothing new - it happened in other countries already before. 
I see a rising price here, despite there is still non conclusion for the BU/CORE debate. So I am just saying, that a short price jump does not mean - all is fine.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:15:11
I think all news mixed up together, many new users, who waited to jump on the bitcoin train without knowing about what goes on behind the scenes led to the price rise... Yesterday, coinmarket cap also showed btc at $1500 for a short time. Also an impulse. I am getting some popcorn for the next days in any case, and yes, maybe someone can light up what's going on right now... I guess japanese companies may have bought a bunch btc lately.

Maybe I am wrong, but Bitcoin is already a legal payment in many Countries in Europe - for instance Germany, without comsumption TAX. So I don't think that Japan is doing here something to the price.

The price is driven up by bitfinex fiat withdrawl problems, as people massively buy btc to get their funds off the exchange IMHO. Many things are happening right now at the same moment. Technical difficulties on exchanges, different opinions on the future of bitcoin (core/bu), a lot of new users without knowledge about the problems pumping money into btc, new markets opening, people who want to get rich quickly, banks who want to jump the train, fud here and there. Be careful. It is a hot time right now.

be careful with the price situation right now. It rises without real reasons - as there is still no consense. IMHO there are some rollercoaster times ahead. Maybe I am wrong. If you are interested in longterm - always is a good time to jump in! It depends where you are living - in Europe you could use bitcoin.de for instance.

careful guys. this is some serious hot water.... starting to boil.... very hot....
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:16:41
Maybe not for you - but for the many new people to bitcoin. They see the price rising  and think: "Wow - ok, 1400 - Jump on." Without knowing why bitfinex is at 1400 right now.
I am not trying to say that bitcoin won't be worth 1400 or even many times more (I am also a bitcoin hodler) - but right now it seems to me  - and maybe I am totally wrong here - that there is a bubble kept inside bitfinex, waiting to pop - and the market might follow this pop, too. 
So I am just a little sceptical to put on my party hat right now. (I will when I can buy cheap coins ;) )

You're missing an important factor. Bitcoin is not created by a company nor by a known person. Companies created 'coins' in the past. Like Linden Dollars, etc.. the difference here is, that BTC is not a premined resource.

There is a lot of false news and claims around right now feeding the FUD.  
Insiders would have sold, if there was any ban incoming - a drop of at least 50% would be the case.
Actually the time for bitcoin is perfect. It is the perfect storm. Great new technologies incoming - Lightning, Atomic Swaps - and regulations are totally fine in countries, where bitcoin is not regulated yet. So forget about all the FUD and don't look at the charts all day. Bitcoin is in good conditions!
HODL on and keep relaxed. IMHO 2018 is a great year for Crypto.

You can download the blockchain on your PC and put it on the HDD, too. Instead of days it takes a few hours (depending on your speed)!

"the Yellow Vests." - Who are "the yellow vests"? There are no "the yellow vests". Is there a leader? Is there a spokesperson? Is there anybody who really speaks in the name of the people? No! There is one guy on a YouTube Channel.
It's like saying "the r/bitcoin" or "the bitcoin users". Those Yellow Vest postings are getting a little bit out of hand here. The yellow vests consiting of groups of many different people - some have good faith - others do not - some are extreme right, some are left, some are neutral - some have just no clue why they are standing on the streets and bashing cops. Those protests will get instrumentalised by the parties who can profit, soon. And those parties are everything but good for our world.
To talk in "their" name is completely naive. Stop this populistic posts. Please. This is not r/theDonald here. Thanks.

Bitcoin.de - buy bitcoin and if it's only a small amount you can keep it there. If it is more, take it off the exchange, get a hardware wallet (ledger, trezor) or a paper wallet. You can also buy small portions of bitcoin like 0,01 btc. Have fun. Noob

What kind of facts do you want to hear?
you will have big trouble with paypal as people can get their money back when they buy bitcoin. Only if you sell a usb stick filled with bitcoin it maybe would work - but prepare that paypal might close your account. They really don't like bitcoin or any other crypto.

Bitfinex is in a problematic circumstance (USD withdrawal is not possible). That's maybe one reason for the price spike. Even 1500 looks beautiful, I'd be careful with euphoria.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:40:32
everything can cause a dip. "What goes up must come down." Everything that rises, must *correct* it's position. Nobody knows if bitcoin will ever drop below 1k again. In 2013 everybody was sure, next destination is moon and look what happened in between. Dips to under 200Dollar and over 1k. So everything is possible. If somebody would know the future for sure, all this speculation wouldn't make any sense.

You sound a little bitter, maybe because you didn't join the club when it was $30? Come on hop on now, not too late. Bitcoin is here to stay no matter what you think. Nobody loses money when not selling lower than the investment. Did you analyse the chart lately?

Any idea/explanation why China goes into opposite direction on e.g. bitcoinwisdom.com?
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:18:40
That's correct. But when the price on bitfinex raises, the other exchanges follow. I am just guessing of course. Maybe I am wrong. But bitfinex is definitely something which influences the price.

Unpopular opinion atm, but those bitfinex spikes are still scary to me. I don't trust the situation. Bitfinex has nothing to do with Japan, Russia and other circumstances. The market follows every spike by bitfinex, this can't be healthy. No other exchange leads the price run. IMHO.

Small PSA:
You can download and verify the Blockchain on a PC, too. This will save you a lot of time as the raspi needs much longer to download and process. Just download directly to the external HDD / verify on pc and then connect it with the raspi.
Just use bitcoin core, set it up and start the download process on a PC

@_date: 2017-05-15 19:08:58
I guess he used something like bitaddress.org to create a paper wallet and then used a BIP38 Encrypted passphrase to make it save - sent the btc to the paper wallet?
When you read the qr encrypted private key mycelium will ask you for the password / passphrase he set up. 
If he had them in mycelium and didn't write down the seed - normally a chain of words - which is super important - it will be impossible to find the correct seed.

You won't lose money if you hodl.
Selling and rebuying maybe works, but you need a lot of luck as the market is not predictable. Whales are waiting for weak hands. Long term hodlers win. Short sellers gamble. Good luck.

I think this is a personal decision - nobody knows where the journey ends. Everything can drop in no time for different reasons. I would get some btc, ltc, eth and just hodl. Even in bad times - close your eyes and dive through the storm.... Spread the portfolio and you are good to go. And keep in mind, that you could also lose everything. Don't keep your coins on the exchanges, get a trezor or ledgerwallet.

Invest for the long run. Step by step. Stop feeling depressed. Just imagine you had the great idea to invest $1000 when btc was at $10. 100btc. All the ups and downs in between. Maybe you would have dumped at $15,00 - forget the past with 'what if'. This is something you can always say when something happened in the past and you see it  now. It's the same for stocks (and many decisions in life). Just imagine you would have invested in google stocks early.... And so on. I know it can make one feel a bit depressed, but don't hurt yourself. You didn't miss the train. Still the very early days and you are here right now. Just be careful with investments in general.

Bitcoin will be fine. And the Bitcoin Guy too. But I wouldn't wonder if there will be a chance for everyone to buy the dip, soonish....

You can try r/ledgerwallet. 
Maybe your word order is just wrong. There are testingtools online to test the words. But only use it on an offline machine.

You could download and sync it on a pc and transfer it later to the raspi. Works even with pruned mode. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:22:35
I am also surprised about the price explosion with so many things to solve. I also think that a lot of new buyers are not really educated about what bitcoin is. They just heard people got rich over night stories so they jumped in. Really excited to see how the market reacts when the next real dip is coming.

I love bitcoin and so on. But those are investors. They bought a pile of btc and now trying to push it with their position.  Don't weight too much what Goldman Fucks or other banksters say about the future of btc. We all know it already. They are pusher and it was never easier to say "it's going down and then it's going up again "...

So funny. The say "look at the chart so you'll instantly see how volatile and unsafe bitcoin is..."
But what else could they say? "Invest in bitcoin! The future is crypto! Forget the Euro!" Would make the bank unneeded...
But I have to add, that warning people on a peak ath to be careful at jump into btc is OK.

you should learn more about how bitcoin and the blockchain works. 
Nano S address can also be reused - your wallet can have several addresses. When you received btc to one address you can reuse this address, but for different reasons you should always use a new address. When you hit "receive" in nano s chrome app you will get another address. But even then you can still use another address in your wallet. Every address in your wallet works as an address.
You can use the addresses without having the nano s plugged in, because the nano S is just a key to the address. Actually there are no btc "on" the nano, but on the blockchain.

there are a few factors: bitfinex (exchange which has some trouble with withdrawls in USD), still unsolved problems in BTC universe, a normal correction - which always happens when something rises quick and some FUD... so nothing fancy, but if there is no dip, Bitcoin will be at $20,000 by the end of the month.... and this would be too easy... ;)
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:18:02
If $1,857 is really the bottom, Goldman Sucks has way too much power and influence over bitcoin....
I mean, what a number....$1857....why not $1850 or $1500

I'd say no. Bitfinex is the reason IMHO.

Pretty sure he is not satoshi. Satoshi never seems to be that *aggressive*. He is likely a scammer. He could use *his* own invention to proof it, but refuses it. Think about that for a second. A real satoshi would not just stand there pretending to be that person, he or she would proof it. Wright is fake.

What if I am Satoshi. Would you belief me without proof? I could give you a well prepared power point presentation. Prepare a story why I've  chosen a Japanese name, in case somebody asks... But when someone asks me for a proof on the blockchain I'd say, no, I won't need to make this... or well, I would try to proof it, but it fails, like it happened

These days, every "journalist" has an idea why bitcoin is soaring. 
Winkelvoss ETF, Russia, Japan, India, Demand, Altcoins are Dead, BU is dead, SegWit gets activated soon, Litecoin, Ethereum is dead, Satoshi is here, BitMain, etc.
I am missing an important point in many articles: The bitfinex Situation. 
This is something which shouldn't be ignored imo. Also there are still some problems need to get solved, even after when the bitfinex problems are finally solved.

A severe enough geomagnetic storm will damage transmission lines long before it damages storage media.
An “EMP,” which theoretically would originate from a high-yield nuclear device, is not the biggest issue in this hypothetical scenario. The biggest issue is the detonation of a high-yield nuclear device, which the world has yet to see occur, as an act of hostility. May that day never come.*

I remember the ups and downs last year end of march and then April surprises. Now bitcoin has matured a lot since last year. Forked. Halving. Segwit. Lightning. lApps. Mainstream news. It's in great shape I think. Don't fall for the FUD.

Actually, if you want to join the network you would normally use Autopilot. This means, your lightning wallet would fund a few different channels and fund them with small amounts. This would take a few minutes. Those channels would mainly be different some bigger and smaller hubs. The next day you go to a cafe and want to pay your Cappuccino via lightning - you probably won't even need to open a channel with the cafe, as the coffee shop would also have connections to some channels - and only one channel needs to be  indirectly or directly connected with your channel.
