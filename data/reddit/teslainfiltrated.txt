That’s assuming a labour theory of value though. Simply putting work into a product doesn’t make it valuable, it’s the utility derived from the product that makes it valuable.

That's assuming the upfront investment in ASICS and transitioning to new currencies outweighs the economic benefits of wielding power over institutions that are affected by the stability of BTC.

Can you elaborate on how it self regulates?

Sure, but on a higher level this is then approaching a POS model where the disincentive for bad actors is one which they forfeit their resources, and with none of the energy efficiency benefits of a POS model.

Its not just not about making money though.  The influence they'd be able to peddle merely having that power whether they choose to yield it directly or not.

Thanks. This does go against the claim though that BTCs network is still adversarial. It's no longer as trustless as it once was.

What you should include is a dirty bitcoin being mixed in and tainting the whole lot.

Thanks. How will typical users know when there is consensus or not?

I’m slowly understanding that the argument is nuanced here.  
Big miners already have the resources to run a bigger node with more bandwidth. Small miners don’t need to run one one as they are usually part of a pool whose operator runs it.
So from the mining side the node resource requirements are mostly irrelevant (other than the limit of safely propagating blocks of larger size)
For the verifying a transaction from an individual security perspective the small ledger size and bandwidth makes sense. 
However the future outcome I’m referring to is one where in which you have a rising threshold for size of onchain transactions as fees increase (a requirement for ongoing security) and then inevitably fewer low value onchain transactions. 
As the onchain transactions steadily increase in size but decrease in volume the reason for keeping the ledger small and bandwidth low becomes less important as the entities who make those transactions can afford the additional resources anyway to verify their transactions.
So the premise of keeping the ledger size small and bandwidth low makes sense now, but maybe not in future.

Understood, but the general idea is that there is likely to be minimal base layer protocol innovation in that time. 
Also, the reason for keeping the ledger space and bandwidth requirements low is making the assumption that this is an important enough attack vector to plan ahead that far, meaning that someone must have some thesis about how these hobbyist full nodes will help mitigate this attack vector.

Eric’s intellectual honesty is something else.

Betterhash is a good point for pools.
I get the impression that most people are not expecting onchain fees to stay where they are. The Eric Voskuil interview talks about this too.
It is hard predicting the future, correct, but we do know that as block rewards reduce something will have to take its place.

How will everyone (and hobbyists) know they are on the “correct” chain in the event of a NYA type attack? 
Is this something within the technical capacity of most people who will be receiving transactions? Is it likely to be at some stage?

If Satoshi didn’t have plans for the 1 million BTC why not burn them?

It is a challenging area to understand, correct. And I appreciate the legitimate answers.
I understand that simply running a node has little impact on the security of the network other than providing a few more geographically dispersed copies of the ledger and some network routing capacity.
The thing that triggered this line of enquiry was listening to this excellent interview with Eric Voskuil   
He mentions the probable trend is increasing threshold for onchain transaction sizes and by supposition, reduced use of full nodes by individuals transacting through their full node.
The economic activity I mentioned is the transactional activity (either low size and high volume, or high size and low volume) 
As the network evolves to higher onchain transaction fees with less low size, high volume transactions taking place the transactions for smaller amounts will migrate to second layers.
This ultimately leaves progressively higher size, lower volume transaction onchain. In this scenario the players undertaking these transactions will be entities that will likely care less about ledger size and bandwidth costs.
