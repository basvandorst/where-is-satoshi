I would like to serious response to this instead of just childish arguing.  I am a hardCORE supporter, but I will admit BTC has been getting on my nerves lately.  Thinking about moving my BTC makes me cringe.  Either loosing a whole day’s mining profit or waiting a week to move it cheap.  Are we looking at solutions being fully implemented soon or are we still a long ways off?

I saw an excellent point about this a while ago (more on the topic of Airdrop).  Made a lot of sense.  You should pay if you cash out.  How can you be liable for a free gift you may not have even accepted. They used the example of a coffee shop giving a free bag of coffee to everyone in town.  Are even people who don’t go in the store to accept the gift liable for taxes on it just because they’re eligible for it?

Fees are denominated in satoshis (or in bitcoins) not dollars so say the fee to send is .001btc.  When bitcoin is only at $5000 the fee “cost” $5 but if bitcoin is at $15,000 that same .001 fee was $15.

“until the very end” implies that this is nothing more than a pyramid scheme.  I don’t believe there is “an end”.  I believe this technology will be used long into the future and even after it becomes the main tool for trade it will continue to evolve.  My hope is that there is no end.  I am not here to flip coins for a profit. I am here to accumulate tools for future use at a more optimal price than when they become mainstream. As far as bubbles, yes we were in a bubble and yes that bubble obviously popped.  The problem is everyone refers to the bubble as being this huge over all bubble between $0 and $20k. I see smaller bubbles. There was a bubble between $15k and $20k that popped a while back.  Yesterday the little bubble between $10k and $15k popped. When bitcoin shoots up it creates excitement and little bubbles form and eventually pop.  This does not mean we are headed back down to $100.  If you didn’t sell at $14k you are too late.  Just hodl until the next bubble forms. There will be many bubbles to form and pop on the way to $1mln.

This stuff very much has intrinsic value.  Blockchain. The fact that we now have a way to make digital goods that can not be duplicated has extreme intrinsic value.  Crypto is the currency that this value is denominated in.  Crypto is what allows value to flow in, out, and through these very valuable systems.  Intrinsic value like a mofo!

I would gladly pay the network fee to have the experience of ordering KFC with Bitcoin.  The fee situation is a huge problem right now - I hate moving my BTC.  1) I think it will be fixed - it has to  2) Keep in mind fees do go up with price - .0001 BTC is just worth more now than it used to be.  Would you rather have $1500 BTC with $4 fee or $15,000 BTC with $40 fee?

All this talk is insane!  Bitcoin price falls $5000 after going up $15,000 in a couple months and everyone flips?  I’ve hodled through way worse multiple times this year alone!  Of course the fact that a failed to hodl back in 2014 makes it real easy hodl now.  I could easily hodl my way all the way back to $5000 and be just fine.  I still remember how stoked I was a few months ago when we hit $5000 for the first time.

I don’t remember exact numbers off top of my head.  I’m thinking like bitcoin being $3000 and dropping below $1000 in a day or two.  That’s like 60% loss.  I don’t feel like we’re headed that far down this time. We’ll see.  I have learned one thing - after Bitcoin is done going down, it goes up.

Not really sure what to make of this.  Life is tuff.  I’ve been in worse spots than I’m in now.  I have learned some people are rich from luck or inheritance, but I think a lot are rich from the same thing that has put me at an ok place in life - hard work, persistence, and some smart moves.  I’ve found the better I’m doing the less I hate the rich and the further I get the more I realize many of them worked hard for what they have.  Either way, just like you say it’s messed up for them to measure themselves by money - it is equally as messed up for you to measure yourself by comparing to other people.  It sounds to me like you’re measuring your self worth against their success.  Make your outlook more personal. Be proud of who you are and what you accomplish.  There will always be sonone above you you and bellow you.  You are you regardless of anyone else’s position or opinion.

Like most businesses there are hidden costs.  Now most of these machines are still gouging a bit, but they will always have to sell above market price.  I would guess that going to buy only had to do with licensing.  Anyone can sell BTC, but to convert BTC to cash makes you a money transmitter and requires a license.  It also increases liability and risk.

I do not need faith. When I see the facts and believe in the principals it becomes quite obvious what the outcome must be.
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:17:10
I would say so. I started mining in 2013.  Unfortunately I lost faith when things went down hill and sold most of why I had at the brining of the decline so I missed my first chance to be a millionaire.  Of course the equipment I used back then paid for itself a thousand times over just from the little bit I held on to until now.  The miners I started purchasing at the end of 2016 gave also well paid for themselves.  For example my S7s were purchased for around $300/pc used, mined on for 6 months then sold for $600/pc.  Now my most recent purchases of S9s, D3s, A3, etc.  a year ago are another story.  Most of them have paid for themselves but it’s much closer to a break even situation.  Lesson to be learned is mining successfully takes research, planning, a little luck, and continuous work.  I haven’t had a lot of time over the last 6 months so I missed some opportunities to properly time trading out equipment.  Because of my lack of time/work I’m stuck with a floor full of D3s and S7s that aren’t hardly worth plugging in at the moment and can’t hardly be sold.

You’ve got the basic idea down. Check out bitcoinpaperwallet.com for nice printable paper wallets.  Follow directions to fold it up properly and use a piece of tape to seal it if you don’t want to order the hologram stickers.  Put it in a ziplock bag.  Keep in mind if the paper is lost/destroyed the money is gone so might be smart to print two and keep one copy/give one copy to the kids parents for safe keeping.

Not sure exactly what you mean here.  It’s like any other business - you get as much as you can convince the customer to give you. Overall I try charge reasonable prices that make sense for both parties.  I want my service to be valuable and beneficial.  I also want to make a fair wage.  That being said - yes I often spend 5 hours on something and write 2 hours on the bill.  I charge up to $90/hr so even at this rate I’m making $36/hr.  There’s enough jobs that are closer to actual time spent and occasionally some that only take 30 min but get billed 1hr.  It works out ok I suppose.

Speaking of adoption. I see an awful lot of capital gains tax questions floating around. This is one reason I'd like more places to actually spend crypto. My thinking is that I only need to claim capital gains when I sell crypto.  If I just keep mining (technically at a loss) and keep my crypto rather than selling I haven't made a profit.  I guess I'm looking at it like crypto has been declared property.  As long as I never sell it for fiat I don't need to claim capital gains tax.  Having say a grocery store that takes crypto would enable me to never have to sell the crypto I mine.  Am I looking at this right?

Actually not the worst idea.  It is “free” advertising for BTC and could possibly bennifit the seller at the same time.  What if we had Bitcoin branded everything.  Current members of the community could buy products they already buy anyway and be contributing to decentralized marketing campaign.  Sellers benefit knowing they already have a loyal audience to buy their products.  Before you know it the BTC logo is everywhere you look.

If someone genuinely wants help they post a little more information than that and/or engage a bit more with the people trying to help them.  Also, by the way, most of those noobs are leaving their coin on Coinbase because they have no clue what they’re supposed to do next.  At any rate, if it’s really been 60+ hours your transaction should either go through or be returned to you within the next 12 hours. If it’s urgent there are options such as accelerators or RBF.  Sorry for the incomvienience, but there are some people trying to break Bitcoin at the moment.  Good news is it doesn’t appear to be working and should be over soon.

I follow you and it’s exactly what I’ve been telling him.  It is difficult though.  I can imagine being a naive consumer and having a huge chunk of your money out of your control with virtually no one to help you.  I try to be that customer service rep to as many people as I can (and educator), but my knowledge/ability has a limit at some point.  Definitely something that needs addressed as this wouldn’t fly on a large scale with the general public that doesn’t necessarily have friends in the space.

@_date: 2017-11-14 14:13:14
Yes, at the surface this sounds great to me. Means getting rid of China domination, I make a heck of a lot more with my current hash power, and possibly some low price Bitcoins.  Then again I don’t know about the price. Could drive it up as I don’t know what chinese miners do with their mined coins.  I hodl 90% of my mines coins.  If they tend to sell a high percentage right away this could actually mean less new Bitcoins to market and a price increase.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:27:07
Hoping someone else jumps in and explains.  The way I see it difficulty should be re-evaluated at least twice a day if not once an hour to make sure block time stays consistent.  What’s going on now is unacceptable.  I have people I introduced to Bitcoin screaming at me about what a horrible system this is.  I’m having trouble explaining how this is any better than bank to a person who’s entire investment has been in limbo for three days and no help figuring out what to do.  Bottom line is this is worse than trusting your money to some fat cat banker. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:08:14
Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think so. Because with that little hash power it would probably take you 10+ years to find a block.

Also, any idea how long it takes for the transaction to fall back if no further action is taken.  I’m reading up on RBF and CPFP, but would rather not mess with it being that I’m still learning.  Plus I need to get keys moved from Jaxx to Electrum or Core wallet so I can actually do something.  The fact that he was using Jaxx w/ Coinbase seems to have complicated things as I think we are also dealing with multiple Jaxx bugs and a Coinbase transaction I don’t understand (there’s a page full of inputs to one output which I don’t fully understand).

This. Such a wild ride. Just remember how you felt a few months ago - bouncing up and down like a giddy little kid over how smart you were to be involved in bitcoin.  You will feel lile that again if you wait.  You will also feel like this again - so scared and wondering how long you can hang on.  These emotions cycle through with the market every few months.  Take a look at the chart - almost perfect steady growth over the last full year.  Peaks and valleys form a perfect line.  The only exception is the obvious bubble from $10k to $20k way too quickly.  We are still on track for one million by the end of 2020.

I’ve never saved a dollar in my life until I met Bitcoin.  I have saved a hell of a lot in the 4 short years I’ve known bitcoin.  I pretty much refuse to “cash it in” even when I desperately need money.  I do try to use it as much as I can when making purchases at places that accept it because I support adoption and support businesses that do the same. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 05:39:23
Nothing close to that statement was made. Quite simply “Separation of money and state” means the government doesn’t create it, destroy it, or control (money[the means of exchange]).  They still get paid to do their job.  In fact under this ideology it’s even more like they truly “get paid for the work they do” rather than the way it is now that they just control everything. Who gives a fuck if you say your only going to the government $10 for a service when they decide what that $10 is worth.

Another example of something made to thwart criminals having little to no effect on criminals and mainly being a burden to law abiding citizens. Take product keys and software licensing - is there a pirate alive that can't install an illegal copy of Windows?  It doesn't even phase them while I sure spend an awful lot of time helping my clients activate legal software they've bought.  I also hate to think I could end up on a blacklist for helping my clients that have fallen victim to ransomware and/or scams just because I was caught in a shady area while trying to help them.  The most secure, user friendly, PRIVATE coin will be the one first to mass adoption.

I’ll check, but I’m pretty sure I opened the port already.  I let it run for a month and never got the whole chain.  Started playing around with it and did the fastsync option which did get me close to the top, but every time it seems to stop like with like 100 blocks left.  I’ve seen a lot of people with that problem - some have suggested bad nodes sending out spam.  A few have suggested that I can’t handle the disk I/O and need a dedicated machine with SSD.  Seems like a big problem for a decentralized system - the fact that ordinary people can’t easily setup a node.

Hi ��
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:52:10
This is very true.  This idea that Bitcoin is "getting too expensive" is as stupid as buying high and selling low.  Problem is it is people's natural instinct.  I just got a buddy interested in crypto.  I asked him the other day if he had bought any and he said, "yea, ETH and LTC".  I said "why no Bitcoin" and he replied, "Bitcoin is too expensive, LTC and ETH are more affordable".  He knew while the words were coming out of his mouth that was stupid, but he still had thought it and done it already.

My first inclination was to help an important member of our community.  You raise a good point though.  I'd have to imagine Luke has at least 100x what's in my bank account right now and has to be hodling more than the fraction of a Bitcoin I've busted my ass to stack up.  Not to mention the possibility of this being a scam - anybody know for sure?  Then again, I suppose if you are someone who's already got their Lambo it wouldn't hurt to give back to someone who helped you get there.

I am running BTC, LTC, and VTC full nodes with no slowdown.  All on the same computer too.  I’d be running ETH too but I’ve never successfully got the whole blockchain (been trying for 3 months).  Obviously it depends on your connection speed - mines 60mb/s

That's the method I've been using.  I almost got a ledger but then thought it was a lot of money for something I feel like I can accomplish with a flash drive and some encryption software.  I also don't entirely understand how they work.  I guess I'll probably get one so I can learn.

I buy with crypto any and everytime I see it is accepted.  It's fun and healthily exercise for my Bitcoins which always make their way back home to me.  Use your crypto and buy more with the fiat you would have spent.

It’s actually pretty cool how the website works.  The code actually runs locally on your machine so the website never actually has possession of your keys nor are they transmitted over the internet.  Of course an infected local machine is always a problem no matter what you use.  Also, it’s also smart to use appropriate storage methods for appropriate dollar amounts.  In my case I was making a wallet with .01btc. I probably wouldn’t use it to store $60,000. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:40:46
That's right! One upvote! (I was hoping for more).  Just hodl China.  I do it!  Every night I go to bed knowing when I wake up I'll be $3k poorer because of China.  But I do it!  Want to know why?  Because I believe in crypto, I love crypto.  Come on guys!  Get with the program - WE HAVE YOUR BACK!

I'm not sure fiat is "doing it just fine". If it were, why would we all be here.  I like the comparison to renting DVDs and paper books.  Neither of those disappeared entirely, nor did they diminish in abundance overnight - but the internet surely took their place as the preferred method.  That is how I see crypto.  We are a long, long way off from replacing fiat, but we will continue to move more and more in that direction as time goes on - just like records, tapes, and CDs.  And just like those things, don't be surprised if it's something a little different than the Bitcoin we know today when we get to that point.

Printed at bitcoinpaperwallet.com which let’s you create them right from the web or download the software to run from an offline computer.  Numbered hologram stickers and protective sleeves can be ordered there.  Makes a nice piggy bank too.  You can continue to load it up over time using the exposed public key.  When you’re ready to use it you open it up to expose private key for spending which damages the hologram sticker so you know the private key has been exposed.

What will be safest place to store BTC during the fork?  Will the fork be the same as the last one?  I kept my coins in Core wallet during that fork and came out fine/able to claim coins on both chains.  Is this fork the same.  I personally feel like I support the legacy chain but on the off chance S2X chain is worth something I’d like to be able to access both.  I’m a little concerned with this no replay and don’t fully understand how to do this right.  I think it’s very far fetched, but if the S2X chain does take over I certainly don’t want to be left holding only worthless coins.

I like this a lot.  This with smart contracts.  The locker could literally be locked with a smart contract.  A private key required to view the contents so only the recipient can view what’s inside.  Unlocking the door automatically releases payment via smart contract.

Everyone running a full node should stick an S9 right next to their node.  Crypto is proof that many spread out people coming together as one is powerful.  You don’t have to be out to make huge profits. Even with electric costs you should break even after 4-6 months.  After that your making a couple hundred bucks a month for helping the network.  Also, if you hold your earning the price is retroactive - so if Bitcoin hits $10k a year from now that means you were making $500/mo. the whole time. I’m a huge supporter of everyone running at least one miner and further decentralizing the network.  China shouldn’t have over half the hash power.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:41:59
Thanks. I’ll check Gemini out. I’m surprised at the lack of response and talk in general about this subject.  I’m not panicking but would like to hear more discussion as from what I understand most of the community is not for 2x but three of the biggest companies (that represent most of my transactions) are supporting it.  It’s just a hair frustrating as I try to get a grasp on things.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:42:06
I actually decided to do this. I’m keeping keys for everything I give out.  If after years they still show no interest I’ll be able to make sure it doesn’t go to waste.  I like my coins too much to see them wasted. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:45:24
That’s not a bad idea. I asked. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:34:58
You don’t necessarily have to have “cheap” electric - just an efficient miner.  The S9 (please, someone make a competitive miner!) is very efficient and can still profit at even an expensive electric rate.  The S7 at half the cost (and half the efficiency) can usually still break even. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:00:02
I told her several times to take it home and put it in her safe.  I explained that it would be worth $1000 next year and not to loose it.  I think she’ll hang on to it. My dad still has his from father’s day which has already nearly doubled and has bonus BCash now.

No down votes. All are legitimate concerns.  I get into this stuff with people all the time and usually the answer is there is no answer.  You will always be able to find some risk and most protections are a trade off.  I just try to do some due diligence with security and stick to sell known products.  I accept there will always be some risk.  Laminating is a good idea.  For the most part I think these work pretty well.  I try not to store too much in any one place too so if I loose one wallet I’m not devastated.   I keep it spread out over computers, phones, VMs, and paper.  I may invest in a ledger when I start actually using BTC to buy things regularly. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:14:19

@_date: 2017-10-15 20:05:41
I know what you mean. I’ve given out hundreds of dollars worth of BTC (I am very much the evangelist) and always worry that they’re just going to get thrown away.  I always want to tell people “if you decide you don’t want them please give them back”.  Times are changing though.  It’s gone up so much since 2013, it’s becoming more we’ll known, and there have been enough missed opportunities that I don’t think people are so quick to throw them away any more.  I like the paper wallets because it gives them something to hold on to and I feel they’re less likely to get a new phone or uninstall the app and loose them.  It’s also nice not having to rely on non-techies to keep them safe from hacking.  
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:15:44

Also, the part about the scam is because he thought someone else now got to keep his $200.  I had to explain that we can forever see his coins (can get public keys from Coinbase records) but will never be able to spend them - another whole concept to explain...
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:51:51
How easy/hard is this?  I've been mining since 2013 (I'm somewhat average on blockchain knowledge) and don't recall ever seeing a setting that allows me to pick fees.  At the moment I mine on Slush.  Say I wanted to dedicate one miner to low fees - how would I do that and would it even have an effect if it's just 1 miner?
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:32:48
I do think this would be great.  Clover is another one.  A lot of the little shops I’m talking to about accepting crypto use one of these POS systems.  It would be great to have crypto added as it would make it so much easier to get them started. The more integration the better. One of the big hurdles is the fact that these all-in-one POS systems make accounting so easy for shop owners.  They love the idea of accepting crypto, but are not eager to complicate accounting/paperwork. Adding crypto (or any other currency not natively supported) adds a lot of extra accounting work. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:46:43
Yup. I’m realizing more and more how I’m going to have to provide storage service for people until crypto is dumb-proofed for the public. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:45:41
I don't care either way.  I'm happy when my portfolio rises in value - it's fun. I'd also like more crypto than I have so the FUD doesn't bother me - provides opportunity to buy.  I believe in this technology so I'm here to stay - not abandon my position at every downward turn.  If you do this you will lose money unless you are an avid trader.  I am not - I've tried this - always too late to sell and too late to buy back. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:05:47

I somewhat agree with you here.  Certainly not going to change the world with one Overstock purchase.  He could have left the “did my part” comment out.  That being said cut the guy some slack.  We’re all on the same team here so we don’t need to bash each other and be overly critical.  I doubt he was being arrogant nor did I get the impression he really thought he did something major for the world here.  Sounded to me like he was just sharing his experience with Bitcoin and encouraging others to start actually using Bitcoin.  I did the same thing when I made my first purchase on Overstock.

Thank you for posting this. Not sure new miners realize how important this is.  Any time I start mining a new coin I check the hashrate distribution and go with the 4th or 5th largest pool.  Lots of good reasons to switch from btc.com to Slush. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:41:50
Yes, that is typically step two for me when I think they can handle it.  Obviously they are overwhelmed with the crypto world when they first start. I have been mining since 2013 and I am still overwhelmed!  I usually keep it simple and recommend they just spend time educating themselves and buy/hodl at Coinbase.  A lot of these people can barely use the computer as it is and wrap their head around crypto.  To throw them into a full on exchange is usually more than I can explain in a 30 minute conversation at  bar with no computer in front of us. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:37:37
The real answer is “Yes, yes you can buy groceries with Bitcoin”.  You can buy mostvanything with crypto I’m sone form or another. Is it the most convienient or cost effective way? No, not yet, but we are getting there. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:35:21
I still can’t believe no one is concerned about this.  Maybe I am not understanding what is going on.  When I look at Bitcoin.org Coinbase is listed as a company forking to Segwit2x.  None of the other big exchanges (Bitfinex, BitTrex, Poloniex) are listed.  Am I correct in assuming Coinbase will be selling a different Bitcoin then these other exchanges?  I am looking at it as Bitcoin purchased on Coinbase will not be considered Bitcoin by any of these other exchanges - am I right?  All the info I find on Coinbase website seems vague and just says “we’ll do what’s best for our customers”.  Since I’m not getting much of a response here I tried writing Coinbase.  Hopefully they will respond and clear things up.

Please elaborate on the lack of security.  I believe it’s respected as one of the most secure blockchains.  Most hash power, most nodes, most developers.  Speed issue has been addressed.
It’s a good time to buy because it’s price is on the low side right now.  Had it’s run?  It hasn’t even started!

I was very interested in setting up my own ATMs when I saw the clientele of these machines and the insane fees they were getting away with.  Big hold up was it didn’t sound as easy as buying a machine and placing it in a store.  There’s licensing and regulations to comply with.  Plus you need liquidity - meaning you need a large chunk of fiat and BTC for the machine to use.  TLDR - much harder than it sounds.

Could someone make a simple list of what users should do to fight against these yahoos?  I've been involved with crypto for 5 years, but still can't figure out how to "place my vote".  I can't figure out if I should be running Core or Classic or what I should do to voice my opinion.  A simple list of 5 steps for people to do might get people moving.  I can't be the only one confused by this political mess.
