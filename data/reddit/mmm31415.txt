read the charts

because bitcoin isn't like any other equity out there
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:35:37
yeah and so is the price of bread and some deli meat
once again the conservative, sandwich heavy portfolio is paying off
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:54:59
from all the groceries and utilities and rent you can use bitcoin to pay for

it's just all potential at this point. there's too little current uses for it. acquiring/sending/receiving bitcoin is cumbersome for newcomers. 
once it's as simple as a bank account/credit card then sure. to the moon. 
until then there just seems like much better uses for 200K equity than 20 BTC

stop spreading FUD 
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:54:15
back to 6K then 7K then probably 2.5K floor where it should be. 10K is insanity
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:05:46
if there's a hustle you can think of, there's already 100 persians doing it better than you

when you can actually use bitcoin to do something besides gamble and buy drugs 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:50:24
just go back two years and then divide by 2
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:17:35
you can use it to hold equity across generations
it's an agreed upon measure with a finite supply that has stood for thousands of years
if bitcoin is around in the year 4000 i have no doubt it'll be way past the moon
also it looks pretty
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:54:40
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:57:46
when you keep buying at 8k 9k 10k 11k 12k 13k as it moons then yeah. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:05:49
just try them all check your search history

Did you know that the average rate for a hotel room 30 years ago was $19? Today it's $237. That's a 1,300% increase. So it's not inconceivable to think that in another 30 years, a week at a hotel runs you 20 grand.

@_date: 2018-03-30 12:05:15
dude got hustled
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:46:23
how many days are in a week
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:42:23
if you would read the graphs then you would know he's going to outpace his APR
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:20:22
this is wrong
equity is equity
