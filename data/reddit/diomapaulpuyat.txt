Is there a work around so that non-US citizen living in other county can buy from coinbase? We have a similar exchange here in the Philippines but they have 10 dollar 'fee'.

Thank you very much. :)))

I'm from the Philippines. Can I participate too? This is a great idea in my opinion. It's like people are helping each other for the greater good of all while making some money. :) More power dev. :)

This will be my first bitcoin in my wallet. Yey! Thanks in advance. :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:40:37
That's okay. I can help translating if you need help. But in my opinion, it is not needed since most of the people here understand English although not everybody can speak and write well.

This is like a Game of Bitcoins. Don't let them win. One does not simply let DDOSer win.

A man has been out of the loop for so long. How much fee should a man include to avoid such thing?  I'm sorry for hijacking your thread.

Maybe he is saying the the hacker came from the Philippines?

But that's what they are doing with us. They are risking their money just for us to go to college and have a degree. I just finished last year and my sister is graduating this April. I guess I or we can take this risk.

That's like how my parents sound. Haha. I just talk to her a while ago and seems that she's getting a hold if it little by little. I just hope I can convince her more.

I'll watch it later after my review. I'll edit this reply later for my comment. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:46:57
I'll read it later. Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:42:05
If that's as easy as it sound, i would do it in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:49:22
I could do that. Unfortunately, my board examination is later this week. I don't have a lot of time to spend in finding information to back my claim. I can however prove to her that what I am saying make sense but that will still not be enough.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:29:24
She doesn't have a twitter account. She doesn't even know how to use a computer. That's one of the reason why I have a hard time explaining these things to her.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:37:28
That's the reason why I want to loan money from my mother. Haha.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:50:39
That's one great idea. I think that would surely help me a lot.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:42:55
I would surely use this argument. Thanks.

ELI5 what coinjoin and coinapult locks are.

Why are you being down voted? What are the large companies which invested in bitcoin that are worth noting?
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:55:42
Is this working with garena sea servers?
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:51:36
No this is not gambling. Gambling is trusting in pure chance to gain the money of other people. Gambling is like stealing money from other people but everyone of you has an equal chance to steal each other's money. Investing on bitcoin is different. It is not pure chance if ever that you will prosper with it. If you will believe that it will make a change on how money works and you believe that it will be used like how often fiat currencies are being used today then invest in it. And that's what I'm doing.

Where can we save our private address?
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:09:35
Isn't this similar to bitsquare? What are their differences?
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:11:02
Can you point out some specific details that I could use? Currently, I'm not capable of researching those things because my board exam is just few days away. I like to buy bitcoin as soon as possible because I have a feeling that the price would go up in the near future.

ELI5 what are sidechains and how could they prevent problems associated with processing power?

I'm still sitting at .0002 BTC. But I promise you, I'll have that soon. :) Good luck and may you prosper more. :)

Is this for US citizens only? I'm living in Asia. Can I sign up too?
