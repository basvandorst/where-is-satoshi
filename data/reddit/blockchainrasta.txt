No, that's just a genocidal war criminal responsible for the dried blood of thousands of Native Americans stuck to U.S. military equipment.

Sadly I think this space is over-run by adrenaline-seeking finance bros who can only focus on near-term price fluctuations. If you can take the time to step back and observe from a distance, Bitcoin has only been gracefully moving along.

The Ford Model T comparison is flawed. A better analogy would be to equate the Ford Model T with Bitcoin Core version 0.3.21. Bitcoin Core is not the same today (v. 0.17.1) as it was in 2011. We build on our inventions to better serve us - that's called innovation. 
These professors appear to be making drastic last attempts to maintain relevance. They'll say anything to get attention. In the age of Google, we should do away with tenure.

I see that a few people commented on a new issue at their github, with the same problem as me. I'm able to load the application, but there's no information showing up. Hopefully this will get figured out.

Do you have to log in via the Bitstamp API to see any information? I downloaded this, but I don't see any info populating (without Bitstamp API access)

The title of this post is very confusing. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:26:04
Because all of the exchanges have ZERO interest in anything related to blockchain technology. Privacy you say? Who the fuck cares about privacy when you can profit off of people's personal information.
