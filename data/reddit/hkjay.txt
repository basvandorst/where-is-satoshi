I was wondering when this guy was going to show up here

To the orange blob!

I think one of the major reasons why China dominated Bitcoin mining was the simple fact that electricity is so cheap. It was easy to setup a warehouse full of computers and let it mine away. Also, it's very hard to move Chinese money out of China, so they had a real need for Bitcoin.

Just forget you have Bitcoin all together. Wait 5-10 years. Best case; you'll be rich. Worst case; you'll be able to buy one of the last hamburgers made from real meat. Either way, that day will be pretty awesome.

I ordered nachos at a bar in Tokyo one time. They brought out a plate of Doritos covered in cheese :/

Yep. It's money when it's only convenient for them.

The ivory trade is illegal and the market for it is not regulated by the US government but you can still buy ivory with US dollars. It's just trading something of value with another thing of value.

This took me way too long to figure out your edit haha

Yes, the people who use Bitcoin understand this. But we strive to influence a wider adoption. There seems to be a common misconception that Bitcoin is a unit and cannot be broken down further. It's a failure on our part and I believe it's holding back certain people from entering the crypto-currency​ community.

I was a long time lurker of this subreddit but when I heard about Japan using Bitcoin as a currency I went out and bought Bitcoin in February. I think a lot of people were waiting to see more adoption and not just something you park your money in. I'm excited about the near future when I can buy and sell things in Bitcoin. So I think there's way more interest now.

I'm ok with calling it bits. I just want the general public to realize Bitcoin can be subdivided.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:25:25
I'm ok with the 1/500,000 club
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:39:36
No... From my experience, there seems to be a lot of people who believe that Bitcoin cannot be broken down to smaller parts and therefore never buy Bitcoin thinking it's too expensive. I just want people to use and think of it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:11:35
Yep... Money is a direct representation of your time. You literally spent what finite time you have to exist in earning fiat. The super small window you get to be conscious is controlled by banks... F that Jive!

You wanna get high?

It looks like a jolly good time:

This is the oil of my generation. Anyone vested in this, will do very well.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:54:34
A lot of people like us, yes. But it seems like a lot of people don't understand that a Bitcoin can be broken down further than it's unit value. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:03:40
Down 50 BTC since 2014. I have 11 at the moment. I'm 1/1,000,000 kind of guy. so I'll buy 10 more. I'm holding to the day I die. I've learned my lesson. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:20:51
The day I'm wealthy is the day I can buy anything I want with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:07:36
Ahhh yah... beat me bitcoin daddy!

This also described my emotions today

United States law can suck a dick. We didn't come this far to be just another toy for big banks.

I think Bitcoin will probably want to add enterprise features that make it more desirable for business. But for God's sake, don't go the same route as Ethereum. That ICO freak show is going ruin them.

If she's really the one, she'll enthusiastically say yes when you open the ring box and there's a fat Bitcoin staring her in the face. Haha jk. Congratulations!

Bitcoin was built on University research. It's not like cryptocurrency came out of nowhere. Satoshi picked different aspects of different research projects that have been going on as early as the 1980s to make a publicly viable coin. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:33:16
I'm hopeful August 1st goes well. Once we're past the scaling issue, I don't see why the price of a bitcoin wouldn't scale too. Staying positive.

Out of all the alt coins, IOTA is actually unique. The PoW using a tangle network (DAG for you math guys) is interesting. I obviously like the no fee thing and not relying on miners. My only concern is security. Theres a billion dollar bounty if anyone can break IOTA... So, time will tell
