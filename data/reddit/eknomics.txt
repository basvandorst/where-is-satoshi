Any exchange that can be trusted will want to comply with AML/KYC laws. It's a fairly simple process wherein they check your name against a list of criminals. If you are not on that list, you have nothing to worry about. Your SSN has been on the darknet for some time now, no one cares. BTW, you get red-flagged for even asking this question.

US Citizens banned but they use USD to describe deposit minimum.. interesting choice.

to be clear, they have banned US individuals.  Corporate accounts seem to be in some grey area.

Many long term holders (2010-2011), such as myself, are playing with house money because it was quite easy to cover your initial investment if you avoided falling into the day trading trap. 
We fell in love with the idea of a peer-to-peer money that didn't require third parties. Most of us place a different "value" on bitcoin that is "priceless".  
At this point it's going to be very hard for anyone to pay me enough to sell and i'm willing to go down with the ship.  
As for going thru bear markets,  piece of advice is to IGNORE it, go about your business, focus on education/work/family. Remember time is forever marching on, and the market will have to reverse course at some point. :)

There are no other nodes running that version, so you're gonna have a tough time.

You are discounting potential new miners who can now use bitcoin as designed: cheap, instant, for all.

blah blah blah, so emotional about all this.  You can cry til the cows come home, and it won't change anything at the technical levels, which is all that matters.  have a nice day.

Stupid.  why would a company want to pay for fitness data?  and why would they need a blockchain for that?

Keep thinking you can push bitcoin further by being an a-hole.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:01:43
this is simply an assumption that has no scientific proof yet.

There were a million warnings at the time. Learning how to create a paper wallet and pulling coins out was probably the most influential thing I've ever done in my life. Sorry for those who got goxxed tho

Not if companies start running nodes because they can ACTUALLY USE bitcoin now, which was the grand plan in the first place.

picturing little bitcoins falling out everywhere
