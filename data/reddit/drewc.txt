&lt;article that I read that has nothing to do with currency or blockchain or standard electronic cryptography&gt;. What does this means for bitcoin ?

I love auto-correct.... it makes me correct! 
I am not from England, and english was my second language, so perhaps I am being somewhat pedantic, or simply trying to be correct and not auto.

How do you know some needs to learn english, perhaps both grammar and spelling?

In USAsian english it could be "Y'all". In Nova Scotia Canadian, it is "youse" or "yous". In Irish english, "Ye" could be preferred.
That is just from my knowledge, could be wrong or right.

Good thing I moved from Toronto to "Vancouver, BC" as "Vancouver, Washington" is at least local in Cascadia.

"As someone who is new to bitcoin [and a USAsian] why is it so difficult to buy coin?"
It is pretty easy up here (I am just outside of the mainland, Vancouver), and the average person is intelligent enough to use their bankcard or cell phone for the ATM, so either I am right, you are right, or ....

OR: Give me 1 BTC and I will make sure you are listed! It seems that the instructions are difficult and submission nearly impossible ... ;)

I had the exact same 14.4, and it was an upgrade from the 2400... sigh indeed, I just googled for "Legend of the Red Dragon", and there goes my night!

Yeah, agreed, though as luck would have it, the Goverments do not have control over bitcoin, so the purpose is not defeated ...
Wait.... what point are you making? Silk Road existed and other such sites do, so the Gov'ts did not have control over that ... for that matter, I have friends who grew their own cannabis plants... so even if the Gov't says "no, that is illegal", it is still widely done and, if you are like some of my friends, even a black market for the results... So Gov't does not have complete control over that ... nor over poppies.
Oh, wait ... hrm ... you want Gov't to be involved because you like regulations, and you are upset that bitcoin is outside of Gov't printing presses and banks?
OR : ??

No idea what you are talking about, for I run Xbian on a PI and use it every day to watch videos and play audio, and read ebooks on.
Can you give a little more insight into the issues you have/had and what the problem is/was?
