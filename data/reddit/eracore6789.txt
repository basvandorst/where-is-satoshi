are you sure? has this happened to you before?
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:36:03
They've stalled them for like the last 4 months

When you become a miner your id'd? So they're not part of a pool? Or they're part of a pool that just has no name?

are you a verified user? because im in the process of doing that and they haven't gotten back and its been almost a month :p

Like gold and silver banks tend to collectively agree that they will all sell off their gold hence causing the price to diminish.
Well what happens if all the big time miners and early adopters decide to get together and dump all their bitcoins in the open market and buy them back once the price goes to nothing.

They could make bitcoin futures how hard would that be? 
And yeah there are countless people out there waiting for cheap gold much like Bitcoin but if they see the price of Bitcoin drop a high majority will sell much like gold manipulation.....

once im a verified user will it be easy to send out both bitcoin and cash?
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:09:49
How so? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:46:42
Yeah but wouldn't they be publicly known i mean it seems a bit odd that they just show up all of a sudden. I didn't seem them there before lol

They've gone down now they're at 35. As far as i'm concerned this isn't a huge issue because if anyone almost reaches 51% then the system is worthless for everyone.

about 5 months now and this is the first time i've tried to withdraw funds

I mean his name has satoshi nakamoto in it and he is based in california where all the crypto startups are.
This isn't even a a difficult to decipher its actually out in the open. 
But maybe that was his strategy, i guess it backfired lol

Hey there, thank you very much for your efforts in this tough and difficult endeavour. 
Do you have a public key for donations?
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:47:05
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:37:45
it says that "it is not an efficient amount" but i kept adding and it keeps saying that!!
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:08:41
why would you hide your miners?
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:51:37
So this potential for manipulation could potentially be a possibility then. 
But even if they collectively decided to do this, could the Bitcoin protocol reveal any evidence to this occurrence?
