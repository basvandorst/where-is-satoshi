You may not have noticed, but many times people use  'conspiracy theory' in a sneering way. I 'd rather stick with the neutral 'hypothesis'. My comment by the way was a response to someone who obviously doesn't share your neutral interpretation of "conspiracy theory" but apparently referred to it with contempt. So if you must question someone's line of "reasoning" you're banging on the wrong door.

Thank you. I read something similar. It's quite late so I will call it a day and check if anything happened tomorrow morning and if it's still stuck I'll try this procedure.

@_date: 2014-03-01 19:11:53
It isn't always. Imagine I give you my car to drive in for a few weeks. The car is in your possession, but you don't own it. But Gox did not even receive coins to have them in possession (which would legally allow Gox to exercise certain rights with the coins, like investing them or even sell them, as long as they would return them when asked), they were not transferred to a Gox trading account, but to a personal account customers had on mtgox.com. So there wasn't even a transfer of possession; the customer was the sole accessor to his account, until MtGox decided to unlawfully block all accounts and take unlawful possession of its customers assets.   Makes sense?

Well if they owe you something (like in you having stored btc or fiat there), in bankruptcy proceedings you are supposed to file a claim and you need to say what your claim is based upon. The main question, which is not clearly answered in their document, is what you exactly have to prove. If it's only your identity and supply a bank account or bitcoin address that's ok. But maybe they want you to prove more. Maybe somebody zapped the database with all account information - who knows at this stage?
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:37:52
Bitcoin is perfect for people who can't control their spendings: aside from a hipster bar or a computer shop, there's nowhere you can use it. And those who accept bitcoins run to an exchange to convert them into fiat before some respected representative from the bitcoin community farts it almost into oblivion again, just by saying a few wrong things to the press.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:49:14
Accused by whom? And is an accusation enough for being guilty where you come from? Then watch your back.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:15:55
I agree, but we don't need evidence. We only need some probability and then it's up to MtGox to explain where the btc's on these addresses are, or who has taken hold of these addresses. I still control all adresses I ever used and what shows on the blockhain is also in my wallet. Why would this be different for MtGox?
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:08:40
Interesting read but I don't seek MtGox's bankruptcy. I only want a legal alternative to access the bitcoins pending the technical troubles. If my bank's internet banking is offline, I can still go to the physical bank and withdraw money. I want a similar arrangement from MtGox. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:01:06
With your affection to science you should at least have some second thoughts about a document without an author followed by several public statements from the bitcoin community declaring mtgox dead and all the coins lost without ever having seen the patient. Suddenly a new exchange is announced and the guy that leaked the document appears to have been on an anti-MtGox campaign for weeks. MtGox just wouldn't die, would it? It needed some extra media attention to die and that Coindesk troll with his insurance company just managed to make that happen.  No time was wasted by some well known people from the community  to shed a few tears over the demise of MtGox and then jump and cheer on its grave. Even Mark Karpeles' cat was brought to the stage to support the science that it was really Mark Karpeles chatting.
The only thing we can really know is that in the past few days everybody has been full of shit and that the attempt to track some btc through the blockchain is a lot more scientific than the emotional outcries of people that apparently have earned some authority in ribs community but who have, like you and me, no fscking clue either. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:34:31
The document is fake. It can never be an internal document when it states 'deserves to go bankrupt' and a consulting firm that puts such a thing in the document would be kicked out on the spot.
This is an orchestrated media shitstorm and I'm really interested to know who started it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:35:47
Fair enough, but it's entirely insignificant for the success of bitcoin whether the Winklevoss bros fart or fly. The only thing that will make bitcoin a success is grocery stores accepting it and maybe for the time being in the form of  a colored coin which has fixed value against the dollar to avoid the store owner be exposed to high volatility losses due to legendary screwups like Gox or Flexcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:40:07
The guy was new to bitcoin so he asked a few stupid questions. Big deal. That doesn't make MtGox illegitimate. I know a lot of ignorant CEO's that have very legitimate businesses. And then you have very competent people with a very questionable agenda.

Well that's a rather quick conslusion Erik. A document that states 'The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.' doesn't sound like an internal Gox document. I doesn't sound like a document from a consulting firm either. It sounds like a document from the competition, some bank, some shady government organization or a few people who want to deliver the "Coup de Grace" to mtGox.
The biggest enemy of bitcoin is mistrust and the biggest cause of mistrust is rumours. 
I'm sure that most people with bitcoin can tell what happens at MtGox and bitcoin apart, but the majority of the people out there associate everything that happens at Gox with bitcoin, whether you like it or not.
At some stage the (new) management at MtGox must come out with the facts. It can be bankruptcy, it can be something else. 
But our conclusions cannot come from orchestrated media storms and suspicious documents. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:19:00
Agree, don't expect anything like withdrawals in the next few weeks. If ever.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:11:01
I can only concur. And imho Bitcoin needs a break after this turmoil. Bitcoin doesn't need the press to become successful, it doesn't need another casino-exchange, it doesn't need gossip or emotional outcries or fact-free reporting like last week. I read articles by journalists who can't tell a bankruptcy from bankruptcy protection and I heard people declaring MtGox dead before even looking at the patient. 
Bitcoin needs an economy, it needs to be usable throughout an entire supply chain from consumer to farmer. And being able to pay your coffee at some hipster bar just isn't enough when the bar owner has to run to change his btc into dollars before some troll at Coindesk (hi 2bitidiot) decides to drop a bomb on another exchange, just because he doesn't like it. 
Bitcoin has become a high risk casino game driven by high impact gossip sold as news by clueless journalists. The more fact-free reporting it will get, the more volatility it will see, the longer it will take before it is accepted as a serious alternative to fiat. If ever.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:25:33
If they could get away with this term, they wouldn't file for bankruptcy protection would they? They would say: "Sir, your account has apparently been compromised. As per our terms of use, you are liable for all losses. Goodbye"
They are not claiming any account compromise. You can troll about it the whole day, but it just didn't happen. Period. 
What they claim that happened is repetitive withdrawals from *certain* accounts so instead of a withdrawal of 500 btc, i.e. 5000 btc was withdrawn resulting in a difference between bitcoin liabilities and bitcoin assets. The inability to pay customers what they owe them, finally forced them to file for bankruptcy protection. Again, if only accounts were compromised and only regular withdrawals took place, Gox would have nothing to fear. It's a no-brainer, but I'd be happy to explain it a few more times if you still don't get it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:22:24
They were not Gox' coins. There was no transfer of ownership between Gox customers and Gox.

@_date: 2014-03-01 01:29:52
Mtgox did not file for bankruptcy, they successfully applied for bankruptcy protection. Wonder how accurate the rest of the article is. Great timing too.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:27:26
Maybe it indicates possession, but not ownership. You need a legal title to transfer ownership of goods. Like an invoice, or a specific agreement. I did not sign any agreement with MtGox transferring ownership of my BTC to them. The very fact that I have always been able to withdraw what is mine proves the mutual agreement between both parties that the coins (and the fiat) is not owned by MtGox. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:24:09
What is says is that when they change the rules or cease service, that you are permitted to request a refund. While this term does not include your right to a refund, the following statement "Alternatively..." implies their intent to refund you. While your right to receive what is yours does not explicitly follow from this term, it does follow from the fact that MtGox does not own your fiat or btc, they hold it on behalf of you. When you transferred btc or money to MtGox it was not accounted for as income, but as liability. With the intent to return what is yours, mtGox could never argue that this term was just to permit you to request a refund and allow them to ignore it. A judge would wipe that off the table.
The only thing that allows them to not honour such a refund request is that they are in bankruptcy protection. While a refund request is not honoured immediately, it surely must be accepted as a legitimate claim and processed as such by the trustee. Not all coins were stolen, some of them may be recovered and at some stage enough btc may be available to wholly or partially honour the claims.
But again, everybody is welcome to believe otherwise and forget about his coins, if sending one damn email is too much trouble :)

In that respect 'their Bitcoins are gone'  is a conspiracy theory in itself. What evidence do YOU have that 'their Bitcoins are gone'? 
What you see here from behind your cold pizza is an analysis of what could have happened. An hypothesis, not a conspiracy theory. An hypothesis isn't a conspiracy theory just because it's different from the assumptions of the biggest audience.
If 'their coins are gone' they must have travelled from one location to another and whether you like it or not, it's more likely that a study of these movements will shed some light on what really happened. The mooing of cattle shaking their heads while grazing on the sideline will not. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:25:02
Please go and look up anything you want in US Criminal Code yourself. In this case  Japanese penal law applies. Not that it will be much different in that respect, but still. Second, MtGox doesn't advise people that they are responsible for "any losses incurred".  The term clearly states "due to someone else **using their password or user account**". That's some limitation isn't it? So if someone finds access to my user account and removes BTC from it, I'm responsible. I'm fine with that. Because it implies that someone has gained access and removed BTC from **my**account. If that were the case, this would show up in my transaction log. If I lose BTC that way, my bad. But this hasn't shown up in my transaction log, my BTC are still there so end of story: this term is not applicable. You can't have a wallet with 10 BTC in it, no withdrawal in the transaction log and Gox telling you your coins are gone because somebody transferred them using your account/password. 
The only applicable term here is that Gox changed the service and that you are entitled to a refund. Gox may not have the coins or fiat to give you that refund, but that doesn't mean have no right to ask for it, does it?

The bitcoin protocol is governed by the same property law. If you sent bitcoins to an address with the sole purpose to access them on an exchange, the exchange owner has no right to block your account unless he has a claim or has been allowed by a court to do so.

MtGox owes money and bitcoin to people. It doesn't matter that they lost anything, they still own the coins they didn't lose. Not enough to pay everybody? Fine, let's work on an agreement. Maye they can pay 50%, maybe 30%. 
It's up to them to find out how they can recover what they lost, and if they don't wanto to, MtGox will go bankrupt after the bankruptcy protection is over and Karpeles will probably end up playing chess with Jimmy Hoffa.

MtGox could never have gone down so quickly without the help of some well known people within the bitcoin community and their friends in the media. Apparently it takes only a few kicks in the head when you're down until you end up in the gutter. My best guess is that a bunch of MtGox creditors (people with coins stashed there)  bought MtGox cheap, spread this document and other statements spinning the news that MtGox is dead and that everybody's BTC's are gone.
Well that would be extremely convenient for the new buyers, wouldn't it?

Guy in the fashionable orange thing: It's not the technology behind bitcoin that determines whether you can claim back a payment. You have a legal claim, regardless the way the payment was made (by bank transfer, western union, bitcoin, cash etc.), if the payment was undue (but i.e. made accidental) and you have a claim if the payment was transferred to a party (like Gox) without a transfer of a title of ownership.

Conspiracy theory: The FBI/RIS seized everything at MtGox, leaked the strategy document to Coindesk's 2bitpuppet to make everybody believe MtGox is insolvent and promised major account holders and prominent bitcoin community members to send them their BTC's and leave bitcoin alone if they would shutup and publicly declare MtGox dead. Karpeles was forced to play along.
And the other exchanges were told to distantiate themselves from MtGox or otherwise face the same treatment. 
The outside document that was presented as an inside document. The statements from the bitcoin comunnity, the final verdict, the death declaration, the clueless reporter at the New York Times..the new exchange out of the blue. Al orchestrated to make you think your money is gone. 
So if you have nothing to hide, send an email to MtGox claiming your money back and requesting access to your data. You have that right.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:41:24
No it doesn't. Because if someone would access my account and steal my money it would show up in the transaction as a normal withdrawal, wouldn't it? And if it wouldn't show up as a normal withdrawal then MtGox would have to prove that someone accessed my account and moved funds in another way.
But this is not the case. Gox didn't claim someone accessed my account and stole my btc. They claim an amount was stolen from other accounts by repeated withdrawals of the same coins due to a malleability bug.

Sorry but there is a difference between technical possession and legal ownership. People should really try to understand that ownership is not governed by the bitcoin protocol, a key, a passphrase or by any other wet dream of a software engineer, but by applicable law. The fact that you hold a key to a safe does not mean that the contents are yours. Don't take my word for it, ask any lawyer.

A document that states 'The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.' doesn't sound like an internal Gox document. I doesn't sound like a document from a consulting firm either. It sounds like a document from the competition, some bank, some shady government organization or a few people who want to deliver the "Coup de Grace" to mtGox.
The biggest enemy of bitcoin is mistrust and the biggest cause of mistrust is rumours.
I'm sure that most people with bitcoin can tell what happens at MtGox and bitcoin apart, but the majority of the people out there associate everything that happens at Gox with bitcoin, whether you like it or not.
At some stage the (new) management at MtGox must come out with the facts. It can be bankruptcy, it can be something else.
But our conclusions cannot come from orchestrated media storms and suspicious documents.

I didnt' quite understand...twobitidiot sold all his bitcoins just before leaking the document or just after?

If what you state is true, then all bitcoins that MtGox received would be accounted for as revenue. They were not, they were accounted for as short term liabilities. If you account something you possess as liability, how can it ever be something you own? 
Ownership is governed by property law and contracts, not by the bitcoin protocol. If you look at their terms of service:
1.(MtGox) will hold all monetary sums and all Bitcoins deposited by each Member in its Account, in that Member's name as registered in their Account details, and on such Member's behalf.
MtGox may by notice to Members discontinue or modify the Platform and/or revise or terminate these Terms at any time. Members are deemed to have accepted these revisions or termination to the extent that they continue using the Platform. **Upon such notice, Members may request a refund of any fund balances in their Accounts** by writing to MtGox at support within 60 days of receiving notice from MtGox of the discontinuation or material modification of the Platform.

And we all think he acted alone? Honestly I was surprised to see how quickly all the big names in the bitcoin community took the opportunity to declare mtgox dead before even taking to the patient. Then the Mark Karpeles chat interview with the convenient cat picture and the announcement of that new exchange. I smell fish.

It's not only based on that single supposition. Who is 'we' in the document? Angry customers, gox support staff? Some joker? The document can come from anywhere and fact is that nobody in the media gives a tinker's toss. 
Who has interest in a quick kill? I guess mtGox just wouldn't die in the past few weeks and it needed a final push.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:21:08
Well the only thing we really can be sure about in that 'interview' is that the cat on the picture looks the same like the cat Mark Karpeles has posted pictures of in the past. I can go on IRC and claim I'm Bill Clinton and post a picture of a cigar I smoked on Monica Lewinsky. It may have been Mark, it may have been not. It may have been the full text, it may have been edited. He may have elaborated on who wrote the draft (because he said it was not a Gox internal document) and we may have only seen a part of it.
And what we also know is that the crisis document has no author. It smells intrigue all over it ('deserves to go bankrupt as a company' - who the hell would write such a thing in a crisis document?) and when such a document leaks, I always ask 'cui bono'. Almost at the same time a new exchange is being announced and top players from the bitcoin commuinty bury Gox before it's even officially declared dead. Even the NYT, apparently not giving a flying fsck about the authenticity of the document, spreads it, knowing that 99% of the people will assume it's authentic just because the NYT published it.
Now Gox may be insolvent, near bankruptcy and mismanaged, but this can only be proven with facts. Not with gossip, rumours, suspicious documents or personal feelings of people who happen to be 'close' with uncle Mark and famous in the bitcoin community just because they hold some more BTC than the average Joe or just because they have a visionary status in the community but who apparently have no clue about how much panic , damage and media shitstormts their public assumptions may have caused on top of what already was going on. 
Bitcoin is a great thing. It has no central banks, but it certainly has entities that play a central role. Exchanges and people playing the exchanges through the media by making public statements that have immediate impact on the value of bitcoin and it's usability as a payment instrument for us all. These people should reconsider their position every now and probably refrain from talking to the press or leaking documents for a while until the situation becomes more stable.

I never experienced any withdrawal or deposit problems with btc-e last week. They were only shortly unavailable due to an apparent DDoS.

Nice read..no need to mention you have a degree in anything. The article speaks for itself.

"due to someone else using their password or user account" &lt;-This didnt' happen.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:54:38
Sorry but it doesn't work this way. You can't have Terms of Service allowing one of the parties to do things otherwise forbidden by penal law. If such a term were present, it would be null and void. It's ridiculous to argue such a thing. 
If someone uses your password and steals your money, then this transaction would be visible on your account overview. If such a transaction does not exist, then this term is not applicable.

Yea, feel free not to execute your rights.

So Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. It isn't. It is a secure internet transaction protocol behaving as a compound transaction unit which somehow has attained a volatile value relationship to fiat. It's value is currently driven by a mix of panic, greed, ignorance, vision and opportunity and one day hopefully its value will be determined by a new economy it helped creating.
