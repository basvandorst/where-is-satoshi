And all of these investor will be losing money on Bitcoin. Don't they listen to what Warren Buffet say? Stay away from Bitcoin.

Sorry my friend but you are giving really bad advice. Bitcoin has already had its 15 minutes of fame. And now Bitcoin is coming back down to a miserable reality, it's worthless. Don't buy any more, you are just throwing money down a rat hole.

The same could be said for Bitcoin. In fact Bitcoin is more cringe worthy than Dogecoin. At least the Dogecoin community know they are a joke. Most of the Bitcoin community is delusional.

And it can be duplicated infinite times. What is stopping somebody from creating "poopcoins" or "snickercoins"? Folks, at the end of the day Bitcoin is worthless. It is computer code and can be copied infinite times.

Wouldn't that defeat the entire purpase of Bitcoin? Isn't Bitcoin main selling point deregulation? If Bitcoin is regulated than is no different than the dollar and has no point in existing.

This dentist is a gambler. He is accepting Bitcoin which will soon be worthless. He is fixing people teeth for free and is thousands of dollars in debt from dental school. It won't be long before this dentist is eating at a soup kitchen.

In other words Bitcoin isn't a real currency. The word virtual means not real.

This is why Bitcoin will be replaced within 1 year. A close look at Bitcoin's code reveals it has more holes than swiss cheese.

And soon it will be banned in USA too. The IRS has recently declared Bitcoin as illegal property. It is used for purchasing illegal drugs.

Haha! You are in denial my friend. The price is plummeting and it won't be long before some people lose the shirt on their back. Be ready for sub $100 prices later this year.

My friend, you are a degenerate gambler. You don't know when to cut your losses and will end up losing the shirt on your back.

Meanwhile Bitcoins price is tanking... But nevermind that, lets all invest our savings into Bitcoin and 2 months later be living on the street.

Bitcoin is pointless. Square is a much better service. I have used both and Square is a much better. Is faster and safer. With Bitcoin the transaction takes much longer, and is not safe. And I know some people will argue that Bitcoin has no fees, but that is a lie. Every Bitcoin service I have used has had fees.
