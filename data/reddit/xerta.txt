I haven't read the Maaku Explains ... link, but my guess is this:
Side chains are a wonderful idea but moving coins and value between chains is currently a risky endevour. There is a lot that can go wrong, and if a reorganisation happens one chain can effectivley start operating on a fractional reserve.
Conceptually, think of Bitcoin as the only chain on a balance sheet, and any coins can be moved out of Bitcoin to a side chain, which updates the balance sheet. No entry can ever become negative, but users can move coins from the side chain to Bitcoin provided they a) have those coins on the side chain, and b) the side chain has sufficient balance in this inter-chain ledger.
Presume the following takes place:
* A large number (X) of coins are moved from side-chain-a to Bitcoin. This takes some number of hours to confirm.
* During this time, the attacker is generating a private side-chain-fork and has a significant proportion of the side-chain's hashing power
* When the movement 'clears' on the Bitcoin side, the attcker releases their fork, reversing the transaction on the side-chain, and so the side chain *internally* believes it has W+X coins when Bitcoin believes it only has W coins.
* Essentially your side chain now runs on a fractional reserve.
We all know how things run on a reserve work out.
100 blocks is 2/3 a day (approx), so taking the 3 day estimate it sounds like 200 block confirmations are used.
Here's a bit more explanation, though no sources, which is frustrating. [
