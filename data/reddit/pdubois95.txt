Interesting.   Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:44:02
wouldn't that be fun!  I'd buy you a beer in exchange....

Would this be the famous Mr. Kobayashi Maru?
I don't this you'll win that one.
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:24:49
Very nice.  I'd like to make something like this as a stand alone trading platform.  Think I have a new personal project!
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:42:36
What's the charting software you're using?
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:29:29
Interesting.   I didn't know there were open platforms.  
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:26:05
Taking a quick runthrough of the outstanding tickets on github tells me there's a lot of work to be done. 
A complete audit would be required to ensure security as well.  Looks neat though.
Can't lie, i've thought of doing this kind of thing as well.  
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:33:57
If you guys want BU to go away all you need to do is stop trying to force everyone onto some side chain and just raise the goddamed blocksize already...
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:24:14
Personally I don't believe segwit actually addresses the problem.  It's a temporary band-aid until the powers that be can force people onto sidechains for whatever reason.
Labelling bitcoin as 'digital gold' is really shortsighted.  It's not just a gold facsimile just as it's not just a currency.  It's way more than that.
Of  course, if there is no compromise then it'll be nothing whatsoever...  
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:12:37
I support this position completely. It's eminently reasonable and works towards everyone's benefit.  
Now, how do we get this done ? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:59:28
 Not history,  fact.  We need bigger blocks a year ago.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:35:59
Pretty much what core is saying as well.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:52:34
Of course you don't care about confirmation times.  The checkout clerk ringing up your stuff does though.
It really is important to have a reasonably short confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:33:06
The price is plunging because core can't see what bitcoin needs and BU might not be able to pull off what bitcoin needs. 
If we go with core then bitcoin is centralised and tied down to sidechain interfaces.   
If we go BU then the fear of code quality and malicious activity from bad actors rears it's head. 
We need to put this crap behind us *now*.  Core needs to remove that temporary block limit and work with BU to produce a forward facing Bitcoin.   Sidechains can be useful but Bitcoin must absolutely stand on it's own feet without sidechains first. 
In the meantime bitcoin is losing out.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:50:41
At confirmation times and fees like bitcoin has right now it's not an 'everyday purchase'  kind of thing.  Eth technically does it better.
Doesn't have to be this wsy though....
@_date: 2017-01-27 11:41:04
You're right about the fee, I checked my wallet and reduced the fee option.
Good call on that.
@_date: 2017-01-27 11:34:27
That's possible.   I've heard segwit/LN is vapourware too.  Honestly not sure which side is 'better' in terms of project quality.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:31:42
I see that LN is alpha as of the 17th.   That would imply it's far from ready.  That's probably what people are referring to when suggesting LN is vaporware. 
Personally, I have no opinion on the topic other than I would prefer to see on-chain scaling. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 11:37:17
Nonsense.  Any transaction incurred for any valid reason should not be seen as spam.
It's money and people ought to spend it as needed. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:01:19
My guess is segwit will do absolutely nothing for the immediate future.  LN adoption is required if i understand it properly.
Meh.  There are other options for now and we'll see how things play out.  
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:33:31
My kids are thrilled.  They feel more involved with their money than if they had a statement from the bank. 
As for cashing out - That's what I'm there for. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:45:48
WHOOSH!  Right over your head.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:37:12
It's almost like the real solution would have been bigger blocks in combo with segwit or something.....
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:55:51
Doesn't matter how old the account is if he's right...
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:39:27
BCH might well have off-chain options by that point.
Nobody is against off-chain scaling options JUST AS LONG AS ON CHAIN STILL WORKS.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:32:35
That's an utterly empty reply.  
Considering  you have absolutely no argument against a larger blocksize other than your own conspiracy theory i guess we're at an impass.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:13:41
Speaking of deluded, how are you able to support the idea of node centralization at 2mb?  You honestly think the bandwidth and storage doesn't exist at low enough entry levels?
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:13:52
Which it's doing via algorithm to determine a value.  
That algo is dependent on the fee environment the btc has at whatever period.
As i said,  fees used to be less than 10 cents.  They don't have to be so expensive today.  It comes down to this tard fight over what a reasonable blocksize is.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:59:29
There is no sense of urgency.  This has been going on for quite some time already and core has been stalling and fud'ing for ages.  Some people are fed up and would like this to end because like it or not it's having a serious impact on the community and on general adoption.
Ask yourself, what is so utterly terrifying about doubling the blocksize right now?   It's not technically difficult - Segwit was a massive undertaking compared to this. Why the delay, lies and scare tactics?  
Want off chain scaling ?  Sure! Segwit? sure, why not.  Just don't make it the one and only way that btc can scale.   We *need* some form of on chain scaling to counterbalance off-chain abuse of the network.  With no increase in on-chain capacity people *will* be forced to use segwit/LN.  There won't be much of a choice unless you want to pay obscene fees and/or congestion. 
Let me put it to you another way,  What's blockstream's entire product line revolve around ? Does that business model still work if on-chain scaling works?
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:00:46
Well, you are pretty funny.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:02:39
I don't buy that bit of propaganda.  This is a question of basic functionality .
Would not core forcing most transactions through government controlled hubs be 'business culture' influence?
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:09:58
I'd totally agree on node centralization if we were talking 16mb or even 8mb blocks but we aren't now are we?
Everyone and their dog can handle 2mb. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:54:18
Blockstream to be exact.  I'm rather suspicious of a company who has no product other than the one that utterly depends on small blocks.
....and appears to be wholly funded by current banking interests....
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:08:02
Seems to me if someone is selling someone else must be buying.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:53:30
Bigger blocks also good for anyone who wants to transfer funds.... 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:51:43
The average person will learn how to pick the lowest fee that will confirm within a reasonable time and not end up rejected after 24h? 
Not too likely considering the average person can't even pick the right credit card for their needs.  
What will happen eventually is the coin with the lowest stable fee rate will win and become the norm.  Only dinosaurs will stick to a particular coin by name. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:24:09
Well, we agree on the first part of your statement at any rate. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:30:18
Ok then.  You missunderstood so hard i don't even think it's worth explaining.
Have fun.  Should be interesting to see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:59:32
Holding to a limited blocksize with no view to future adoption rates is crippling on chain transactions.  It's the very definition.
Ignoring the danger of bank and government influence on easily ensnared hubs is a massive mistake. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:47:21
It's not fud and if you understood the debate you wouldn't be claiming it was.
The current crop of devs are influenced by certain business interests.  Go look for yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:12:25
Proto,  seriously.  How can it be that you people lose the narrative so quickly in a debate?  
My position isn't counter sw/ln specifically,  but rather against it being the only solution.
Blockstream absolutely needs onchain to fail.  They absolutely need congestion and they absolutely need to pull profits from 2nd layer options.
Segwit/LN is not by definition a bad thing but it becomes so when it's the only single scaling method we have.  
If 2x fails then the only hope for btc development will be in the hands of a VC backed private company and that will not end well.
So lets get back on track then. What's the exact problem with this blocksize increase?  Why do you think core refuses to even acknowledge such a trivial change?
 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:57:41
Those first two links come directly from blockstream itself so please do take it with a grain of salt.  
While blockstream are not the sole contributors they sure do have an inordinate amount of influence.   They are themselves arguably the monopolizing influence talked about in your 2nd link.
Again - what are their primary product lines?  How would 2mb blocks impact those products?
 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:56:45
By crippling on chain transactions they are doing exactly that.
Look,  larger blocks are not the whole answer.  Off chain has a role to play obviously.  Either one alone will slowly kill btc in favour of something else.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:15:22
Actually,  the wallet devs would dissagree with you on that.  They want transactions to go through reasonably quick and not get stuck in limbo.  
With that logic the fees will be calculated a bit high to make sure the coin goes through.  If the fee environment is already stupid high or highly variable then of course the wallet will overshoot. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:11:36
I trust neither side.  Both solutions are required to keep the other side from overly gaming the network.
Core could stop this whole drama and secure btc's future with this one simple thing.  They won't though.  Blockstream needs their regulated payment channels.
Again;  preventing off chain is bad.  Preventing on chain is bad.  Think about it instead of regurgitating crap from only one side of the argument.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:20:44
Yeah,  it's not running great.  Transactions are still wildly expensive and slow.  
Regarding those fancy new features,  those can go into 2x if core would cooperate on just one insignificant detail. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:51:56
Agreed.  That would be dumb.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:14:33
This particular change in blocksize has zero impact on centralization.  Go do some research of your own.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:24:51
Nice deflection.  Go look at the code and decide for yourself.  
Come back with an actual point.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:10:09
Probably because their entire reason to exist revolves around 2nd layer solutions.  Anything that reduces that need is a bad bad thing for their VC funding.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:33:38
Right now the popular android wallet i use is insisting on a 26 cent fee for a 5$ transaction - the lowest selectable fee using that wallet.  Some time ago the fee was easily single digit.
You'll say i should use another wallet of course but that's a bullshit answer.   That 26 cent fee is the reality for a ton of people sending small amounts.  It's that way because of this ideological war against reasonable block size.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:42:10
Not from what I'm seeing.  Still have high fees and slow transactions.  We need more adoption and that can't happen as tings are right now.
What's wrong with 2mb?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:33:37
The majority of devs regardless, none of them have been able to answer the very simple question of why 2mb is bad.
Notice how you keep sourcing vague statements from blockstream as points? You should ask them what the problem is.  You'd at least have something to go on.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:59:42
That's true.  I obviously misspoke.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:24:32
Agreed.  Short term to get btc transaction price down where it ought to be.   From there we have time to plan long term.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:33:10
The community does want 2MB.  Core/Blockstream does not. 
If the community did not want 2MB then this wouldn't even be a discussion.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:17:53
And then of course we have segwit that purports to help reduce fees.  A few people appear to think fees are a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:22:11
I don't remember segwit having unanimous support.   If it had there would be no s2x and segwit would have been adopted way earlier no?
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:51:00
Look.  Segwit is activated right?  Wtf is wrong with 2mb blocks?
Asciiboost is defeated vis segwit and we get decent short term on-chain capacity.  
No,  nothing is going to freaking break with 2mb blocks.   Calm yer tits people.
Edit :  ok yep.  Replay is an issue but only if you insist on maintaining a crippled 1mb chain.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:27:57
The whole scene is a dumpster fire right now honesrly. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:03:54
Now now.   Just because you have no coherent rebuttle and feel butthurt doesn't mean you need to be resort to insults.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:29:42
Holy false dichotomy batman.  
It's not one or the other,   it's why not have both.
Restricting your choices is simply stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:38:58
Thank you as well for engaging in conversation.  I think if anything can be said we'd both agree that we want to see bitcoin succeed and move forward in a productive and mindful manner.  
You also gave me the opportunity to go read up on something.  Much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:58:11
The mempool is quite analogous to the weather.   Just because it's not raining right now doesn't mean it's not going to rain later. 
Further more, we know that the second we get another rush that the mempool will backlog once again.   
Of course you're aware that china will be bringing their exchanges back online soon.  The media will likely start ramping up again and we'll be right back to massive wait times. 
Doesn't have to be that way.
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:37:14
Look,  you - like every other person in this thread - have not put a single piece of evidence against why core so vehemently rejects this singularly small jump in blocksize.  
In comparison, the very fact that mining pools exist is a much larger threat towards centralization and yet surprisingly there's not a single move towards resolving that issue.  But OMG! A small capacity increase? Can't have that!
You mention hardware cost and the tragic plight of those who could not possibly run a node after 2x.  Are you kidding?  The hardware is cheaper now than it ever was.  If those people can't afford it now they couldn't afford a node 5 years ago.  The net benefit to Bitcoin is in additional capacity RIGHT NOW. 
I have seen what core has written and it just doesn't fly.   Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:45:33
Sorry bud.  That's hogwash.  Core has done much damage simply by being so damned adamant about forcing all scaling off-chain. 
The only reason the hardfork could be dangerous is because core has forced the community itself to fork into multiple camps.  
If core REALLY wanted to bring everyone together and scale for the future they'd adopt a modest block size increase and continue their own roadmap.  There would be absolutely *no* opposition to that.
Can you imagine what the price and adoption rates would be if we didn't have to slog through all this crap?
Honestly,  at the end of the day i don't know who will win in November.  Could go either way.  Doesn't matter though.  I'm properly diversified.   If BTC can't scale something else will.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:31:54
Yeah...  No.
* delayed propagation is artifact of horribly slow network connections.  If you have problems at 2mb you have problems now. 
* harder/expensive nodes is obviously false.   Are you aware of storage prices today? I can't even think of a PC I have that woudln't even 16mb blocks.
* node bootstrap time - again, only a problem if you live in an area without highspeed internet.
* Delay in the fee market?  I'm not even sure how that could be an issue honestly.
* blocksize consensus - That's probably aimed at Unlimited and their variable blocksize.  Doesn't apply here, we already know the blocksize.
* other way to scale - yeah, nope.  Currently no ready to go scaling methods available.  SW already in place and the other options aren't even close afaik.
* Hardfork.  yes, hardfork will be required.  That's exactly how the blocksize limit was put in place.  
Remember - originally there was no limit.   That limit was put in place as a temporary DDOS fix as I understand it.  Since then technologies have vastly improved and that limit should be raised to match. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:48:40
So you wouldn't have understood any details i might have posted anyway?
Why even bother posing the question unless you're attempting to derail things?
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:29:34
Ah!  Just read up on block propagation as you had mentioned it earlier.  
Apparently it really is a problem at the moment due to the use of mining pools.  
Seems to me that the biggest centralizing factor for bitcoin right now is the use of pools for large scale mining. 
Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:14:28
Is it valid to question who or what type of person is using bitcoin ?  Bitcoin is a 100% virtual product and as such I'd argue that all users are by default speculators.  Crypto coins have no inherent value and under the right conditions could go right to 0$ overnight.  Considering that i would suggest that speculation is an inherent function of any crypto.   
Your point regarding listening to those who profit from bitcoin - not quite sure what you mean.  I think maybe you mean 'abusing' more than profiting - would that be accurate?  If so,  it's very true some minors are abusing the system.  Mining pools in particular seem to be problem.  A large jump in blocksize would certainly aggravate that but we're not talking about huge blocks.  2mb would not greatly worsen any currently existing problems - but it would certainly help end users.
Again, it's not that there's a sense of urgency.  It's that core has repeatedly ignored the issue for so long and there has been such bitter infighting over this one single thing that people just want it settled.  2mb is not a huge increase.  It's not irresponsible and it's not difficult.  IIRC core themselves once said such a change could be rolled out in weeks.   
Basically, i'd agree with you if we were talking about a huge increase in blocksize.  2mb however is a reasonable temporary solution that gives us time to implement longer term solutions.   The fact that core and blockstream are so solidly against *any* on chain scaling is IMHO abusing the network in favour of sidechains - blockstream's only product line.  
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:23:05
Why did it take so long to get accepted then?
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:41:22
Yes.  I'd say that's generally accurate. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:22:32
Are you sure you know what bitcoin is?  Because you don't sound like you know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:47:22
Btc did not always have this 1mb limit.  It required a fork to implement that 1mb limit.  
What btc is can change - so lets get consensus and gain both on and off chain scaling.
Again,  i don't think you understand what bitcoin is....
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:50:34
Lower, whatever works and about as much as anyone gives a shit about your opinions. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:09:21
The majority of the world does not currently have a network connection at this time so I'm decently sure being worried about hardware cost is irrelevant.
But to calm your fears,  the hardware is cheap.  It's even stupid cheap.  
If you're worried about centralizing the network there are valid strategies such as mining pools and/or a company gaining control of the development process at the behest of their VC funding.  That is something to worry about,  not a small blocksize change.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:51:11
Which I'm pretty sure is not the avg case now is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:33:26
Or core.  They're in this mess too. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:03:31
Honeybadger don't give a damn.  We'll see what happenes. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:38:32
You keep repeating that mantra like it's the end all\be all.  Things change and those that don't die.  This might be what we're seeing.
Regarding my use case.  Btc did very much apply to my use case.  That stopped being the case when blockstream and core let things stagnate.  For very many people  that's the attack.  Stagnation.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:10:32
Uh,  you just said that....
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:31:05
Nope.  vdogg89 is right I suspect. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:51:59
A pow change would make it an altcoin would it not?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:55:45
A small group of companies or just one company.  Not loving the options at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:14:21
You know,  if we're just  going to blow off the pow with a hard fork anyway maybe it's just easier to kill off the plot by adopting a more reasonable blocksize....
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:17:25
That's your opinion of course.  Could be argued that stubbornly sticking with small blocks is the reason people are going to lose money.
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:00:34
I'd like to try out the keepkey myself.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:52:36
Meh.  UASF is highly likely to end up triggering a hard fork as well when a difficulty change ends up being the only way to keep the UASF chain alive. 
The REAL solution will always be a point somewhere in the middle.  
Seems to me that a bounded block size in combination with segwit would be the best solution.  It would be adopted really quickly and would be completely forward facing. 
Small blocks make no sense.  Everything on-chain makes no sense either.  We need both.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:11:04
Honestly,   the devs just do what they're told to do.  I suspect the real problem is a certain company trying to profit from a crippled coin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:07:53
That's just it.   I'm not the only guy to have this Idea.  There's no technical reason it can't be done and everybody gets something.   
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:21:02
Bip148 is a contentious hard fork is it not?
A hard fork to raise blocksize in a controlled fashion and allow sidechains would in no way be contentious. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:33:17
Holy fuck.  Just put the god damed block size to 4mb and then proceed with an orderly rollout for SW and LN.
Wtf people.  It's not either/or - the real solution is right smack in the middle.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:29:01
Ha!  Correct.  Soft fork.  typos suck.
Crippled on-chain transactions also suck.   Bitcoin needs a combination of solutions to the scaling problem and anyone who thinks bigger blocks aren't part and parcel is just fooling themselves.
That's about all I have to say on the topIc.   I suspect we'll see something happen soon enough.  With luck btc will still be worth something by the end of it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:57:07
I appreciate that,  and yes we do need layer two solutions.  Thing is,  without some amount of blocksize flexibility we run serious risk of layer 2 getting co-opted as a form of control over the largest crypto.  We need direct access to remain a viable choice.
Thinking big is what makes me realize we need  more than one solution.
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:30:07
Like most people i'm thinking if you can't reasonably expect to spend $5 without paying obscene fees i'm going to use something else instead.
The 'Real' one will end up being the 'usable' one.   We need bounded large blocks and side chains and we need it last year.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:55:30
Obviously.  
The point is the content of the comment....
