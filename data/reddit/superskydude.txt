Here's what I read from the Fed: 
It's chock full of Fed gobbeldy-gook. 
If the Fed is paying interest on excess reserves only to recapitalize the banking system, is that coming out of the profits the Fed would typically return to the treasury? 
If so, I'd have to say bravo to the banks!

The chart depicted shows the monetary base, not the actual level of money as measured by M1 or M2. The monetary base (MB) provides the reserves necessary for banks to lend (create) money. 
There is not a direct correlation between MB and M1 or M2 in the short run that I know of. I believe that historically an increase in the monetary base was requested by banks. QE has changed a lot of that however.
With massive amounts of reserves available banks have the ability to create a lot more money. However, that would not happen unless the demand for money presents itself. Also, banks now collect interest on excess reserves they hold at a rate of .25%. So why risk lending money?

Do you mean to imply that the Fed is paying interest on excess reserves held by commercial banks?
If so, this is being done to attempt and control the (possible) excess creation of money by banks by excess lending. 
This new "feature" of the Fed was only created in 2008 if I remember correctly. It will be interesting to see what it creates going forward!

Here is a great article explaining that:

So quantitative easing will result in hyperinflation eventually?

I think that QE was in large part invented to satiate the demand for safe money. Without QE there would not have enough money to satisfy the demand. M2 appears to reflect this.
I think the largest problem the Fed will run into is the return of confidence in the markets. Then the QE that was invented might result in some levels of inflation, in my opinion.
Thanks for your response!

I think we are in an unprecedented and fascinating time in monetary history.  Textbooks will be written in the future predicated upon our transformative period. It's impossible to say with 100% certainty what will transpire. It's fun to pontificate and guess though!

That's awesome!
