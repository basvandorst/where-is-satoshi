I would suggest that you tell your wife about crypto and see how she reacts. Tell her you have like 5k that already turned to 10k and see if she would like to also invest in crypto.

Sorry to hear that man. Yeah btc market is pretty fucked up. Whenever i sell, price will rise immediately after. Whenever i buy, price will immediately drop after. Not sure if it is just me or if everyone feels the same.
