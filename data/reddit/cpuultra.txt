"will it go up in price or will it dip again " 
its literally dipping right now , no one knows what its going to do , don't come here looking for someone to say , yea you're going to get loads of money and payoff your debt, if youre doing this just for the pure money gains you're going to struggle , bitcoin can crash 50-70% easily

Coinbase is actaully the same company as Gdax , you even use the same login and everything, very easy to transfer between the two .
gdax has lower fees but is a little harder to understand, coinbase is very easy to use , very nice GUI and app etc , but has fees .
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:25
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:11

" some ignorant asshole just posted this on facebook " 
Story of the last 3-4 years
Facebook is used these days for people to share their opinions , all the while smelling their own farts while they're doing it.
they think they have some profound knowledge that MUST be told to the world or they'll explode... ( they think
i got off facebook a while ago for this reason
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:38:20
its glorious 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:53:43
1) no , you can sell all your bitcoin and have the USD sitting on the exchange, which you could then cash out weekly if you wanted
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:07
GDAX DOWN
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:09:42
I don't blame you for Panic selling especially with that much money on the line , the mind plays some damn good tricks on you when the price is either tanking of mooning, its crazy , you just gotta try the hardest to just leave it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:32:23
Why ? because bitcoin cash and coinbase got into bed together, then coinbase realized bitcoin cash has aids
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:52:22
a days ATH is another days dip
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:17
because bitcoin is THE coin
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:58
this , can't see that it's their fault .. nope , must be the other guys 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:10
With an exchange like coinbase , gemini etc you can sell them like a share kinda of yea , buy 20 worth , sell 10 worth etc

@_date: 2017-12-24 12:47:38
Transaction fees are much lower because it doesn't have anywhere near the volume bitcoin does , even with its larger blocks when / if more people use it that fee with go up a lot 
not to mention 8MB blocks means the blockchain is going to be over a TB in data very quickly, its not sustainable 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:19:34

you F'ed up ,  stop ( stop loss)  order at £16k means it'll sell your bitcoin once it goes below 16k and sell it at the price you show or the market price , which its currently at 13.. so it sold it instantly . you wanted a limit order if you wanted to sell at 16k 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:34:32
its possible yea
