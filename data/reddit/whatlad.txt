Thanks for your reply. I can see the idea behind it now but, if one CPU cycle is one vote, and some people can afford great CPUs and some don't even have one... How does this model hope to truly avoid the distribution problems of our current model?

Is it the best way to do this, given that it requires an investment of technology and electricity at entry level, is it not already falling into the same stumbling block of wealth access and distribution? And I just feel like its a huge waste of pooled processor power, though maybe in future this can be adapted to something that solves real problems

Whatever the process is that solves the algorithm that grants bitcoins?

So you're saying the transaction itself is public but who it was between isn't? How does that work?
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:59:04
Yeah I understand the function of having a way where its controlled but decentralised, I just think there's probably better ways to do it than making computers do the equivalent of a marathon run as an empty exercise

Do you mean ip address or physical address? Is your ip address linked to your transactions publically?

Probably a lot, but they're not using it to solve invented computational problems made for nothing, they're using it to keep track of transactions and balances. While mining also does this, that's not the meat of its operation

So in bitcoin, transaction records are potentially open to the public?
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:48:53
By a lot I mean an amount of any significance for no purpose. I know about people needing powerful computers to do this seriously, so they're investing in that tech, using that power, but what's actually being achieved? A train moves people or goods across long distances.

And people don't mind that?

But visa etc don't use their computers to allocate money via the solving of CPU problems. They just track money that already is in the system
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:47:09
But isn't that the problem? That the currency is in the hands of the wealthy and the not wealthy are expected to "buy in" even tho they aren't wealthy, and the ones who are play with the market to increase their share and that's pretty much it? Is bitcoin different than this?
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:44:50
So wait.. mining is not the solving of arbitrarily created CPU problems as a way to distribute new bitcoins. It is the process of offering your CPU to co host the network of transaction traffic and process it, and receiving reward for doing so in bitcoins?

While I agree, it appears to me bitcoin is adopting the same wealth access model as the current one, which solves none of the real problems it just moves some of the power sideways
