Many of these policies were in force under the old management team, but the site has been sold to new operators. The new team is changing those policies one by one to become a lot more user-friendly. As for the fees, I think it's actually lower on bitbet (1%).

Yeah, and assuming it doesn't break half of the ecosystem because if the complexity introduced both in the core codebase and all the *external* codebases that don't support it yet, then what ? It'll save a puny 25% ? How will that solved anything on an exponential growth curve.
News at 10: x0.25 capacity improvement on an exponential growth curve (which is what BTC growth would be without that stupid cap) is saving us - about - a week. What an amazing feat of engineering.

You mean when you bet on bitmoose you don't have to pay transaction fees ? Not sure I understand how you can send bitcoins to betmoose without transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:29:47
Ah, I understand, they have user accounts on betmoose.
Good point.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:11:50
Not sure why ?
BitBet fee is lower than betmoose
And when sending coins, fees are your own choice (don't depend on recipient), so ... I'm confused.

The site was auctioned off for 86 BTC which amply covers any loss.
All bettors were made whole.

Correct on both counts, previous owners were well known with solid reps and new owners will need to earn trust.
As a matter of fact, the new owners (and no, I'm not him/her/them) have a FAQ on this very topic:

On the topic of bitcoin betting, BitBet, the oldest bitcoin betting website is up and running again after a ~1 month hiatus.
The bets tend to focus on political events and bitcoin / finance related things, but if you like sports bets you can create your own bets as well
The site is nice in that it requires zero registration (everything is done through bitcoin addresses).
The betting system is weighted parimutuel

I do use it all the time. I am a big fan in fact. I currently have BTC 1.5 on the trump bet at 
But agreed with the poster below : the owners don't muck around and apply the rules very strictly. Be sure to read the FAQ before betting.

After a one month hiatus, one of the oldest bitcoin betting / prediction market site is back, alive and well.
@_date: 2016-05-19 10:05:59
Historically accurate, but the site is now managed by a completely new team and I believe we're going to see the "opinionated part" ebb away over time.
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:47:34
Yeah, there was a change of ownership sometimes in may which led to the event you describe: all open bets were refunded during the owner change period. But no one lost money in the process.

Market is holding its breath : halving is round the corner.

And as I re-read my comment, I realize the inherent contradiction. lol.
But my offer stands : pick another betting site and create a bet that bitbet will not lose *any* amount of customer funds even after the bet amounts held are twice what the site was purchased for.
I will take the other side of that bet.
BTW, after a week of being in business again, Bitbet already holds customer bet amounts worth about half of what it was bought for, so we shouldn't have to wait too long for a resolution..

Since you seem so certain of what the future holds, I would invite you to put your money where your mouth is and place a bet on it at bitbet.
If your predictions come true, you stand to make a bundle !
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:15:19
 allows you to create your own bets, including sports bets.
The fee on BitBet is also lower (1%) than betmoose (3%).
@_date: 2016-05-19 08:47:28
Here is another betting website : 
It's actually the oldest bitcoin site and still one of the nicest.
Key features:
    - zero registration needed (everything is done through BTC addresses)
    - Weighted parimutuel system (the earlier you bet, the more you make)
    - Very simple and straightforward betting interface 
The focus is not usually on sports betting, but you can create your own bets
(including sports bets).

Bitbet has a contract open on this very topic. Current odds says Bitcoin will lose first spot.
