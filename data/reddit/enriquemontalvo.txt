I use IFTTT for a lot things, and it looks like you can set up notifications for bitcoin prices: 
Might be a good place to start.

Does your company actually write the POS software, or are they a reseller? If you have developers I think it would be feasible. Just spit balling here...
1. You need a wallet (i.e. key(s)) for each client, but I wouldn't store the wallet on the POS since physical access to the POS would be hard to secure (just ask Subway!) I would keep the wallets on secure servers with frequent backups. Or you could use something online for the wallets, like coinbase.com although you'll probably pay higher fees that way.
2. Each POS would have a client's address (public key) where bitcoin can be transferred to.
3. When making a sale, look up the current exchange rate from one of the markets and convert the sale amount+tax+transaction reward (e.g. $0.05) into BTC. Generate a QR code for this transaction using the client's address that the customer can scan with their mobile wallet software to send you the money.
4. Periodically (e.g. at each transaction, hourly, daily, weekly, or some other time frame that makes sense) exchange the BTC for fiat to deposit into a bank account or PayPal or something. If you only want to convert to fiat occasionally, and the client is worried about the volatility of bitcoin, you could use ShapeShift to convert bitcoin to nubits, which is a digital currency that attempts to peg itself to 1 USD. Then you can store the currency digitally until you're ready to exchange it.
One issue that you'll have to deal with is that it can take 10 to 30 minutes to get the first confirmation, even when paying a decent transaction reward. Customers aren't going to want to wait around for 10+ minutes, so you might just have to accept the risk that someone might try to double spend what they paid you with a higher transaction fee to have it processed sooner, cheating you out of the transaction.
EDIT: Looks like someone did something like this for their pub's POS. See  . Some differences between what he did and what I suggested:
1. He uses a new address for each transaction.
2. He accepts the risk of double spend attack because his customers are there drinking for a while after paying... enough time to detect fraud while they're still in the pub.
3. He stabilizes the exchange rate and adds a hedge in his favor.

Good advice. It's always safest to send all your bitcoin from one wallet to another when you want to switch. Even the multibit developers recommend that when you switch from multibit to multibit-hd.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:30:37
Also, I'm not sure what OP means by "quickly".
In the US we're starting to switch to credit cards with chips in them (finally) and more places are accepting them. A colleague was complaining (rightly so) that it took a couple of minutes with the new system, whereas the old way of swiping was faster.
The general public isn't going to accept waiting 10 minutes or more for a transaction confirmation for in-person transactions. I think bitcoin has huge potential in many areas of the economy, but the speed of transaction confirmation isn't suitable for all situations.
@_date: 2015-12-25 04:52:16
This is the answer. They also say that in their FAQ, so you should probably spend some time reading that.
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:58:09
That seems fine. Are your transactions taking too long?
@_date: 2015-12-15 04:09:26
FYI every bitcoin (or fraction of a bitcoin) can be traced back to when it was created. All transactions are publicly visible in the block chain. See 
Public keys (addresses) are the only identifiable part of each transaction, but it might be possible for someone to associate some of those addresses with people, and eventually figure out who is involved in the transactions. Achieving true anonymity with bitcoin is actually harder than you might think.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:18:39
It's fine for you to believe what you want, but if you think you have a monopoly on the truth then you're delusional. Personally I think your imaginary friend is just as useless as anyone else's.
Merry Christmas! We've decorated a tree, have music on, cooking a big dinner, and family is on the way over. None of us will mention god(s) but we'll have a wonderful time together enjoying each other's company, and that's the point of it all.
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:23:26
Aside from just understanding what it is, why it's useful, and how to use it, the biggest problems I've seen when helping friends and family get started with bitcoin are:
* Understanding why it takes so long for transaction confirmations, and the importance of paying a decent transaction fee (e.g. 0.0001 BTC)
* The difference between bitcoin as a store of value and bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Price volatility is a huge issue, and people run a real risk of losing their money. I know someone who converts their bitcoin to nubits, which attempts to keep 1 nubit pegged to 1 USD, so that they can easily move their money in and out of bitcoin. They use nubits as a store of value, and bitcoin as a medium of exchange.
* Different wallets manage addresses differently, and you need to understand your wallet to have an effective backup strategy, especially regarding change addresses. It's easy for someone new to bitcoin to lose their bitcoin if they aren't careful and don't understand how their wallet works. I actually hate the wallet metaphor. We don't actually store bitcoins in a wallet. Your ownership of bitcoin is stored in the blockchain. We use wallets to store private/public key pairs.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:32:55
I use Coinbase to buy bitcoin, but I transfer most of it to a wallet on my own computer. Security and offsite backups are especially important if you do this yourself.
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:09:07


That's only about 1/2 a cent USD. I usually pay a few cents per transaction no matter what the amount.
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:57:52
I would recommend looking at something like bitpay.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:42:06
I'm not sure, but it's worth looking into.
There also appears to be a way to determine a "transaction confidence" that is in the 90s within a few seconds. It might be a sufficient way to accept zero confirmation transactions with reasonable confidence and low risk.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:06:15


Larger? [Bitcoin's computing network is more powerful than 525 Googles and 10,000 banks.](


The bitcoin blockchain could be used for notary, proof of ownership, smart contracts, etc. Bitcoin is the biggest use of it, but that isn't the only thing it can do.
It sounds to me like they want something they can control. You know, centralized. Because that's usually better. /s
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:50:03
I've considered this, but I'm confident in my network and system security, I'm not a high-value target, and that only represents about 1% of my net worth. Just in case you're looking for a challenge...
# How to Steal My 16+ Bitcoins #
No system is perfectly secure, but I've tried to make it so I'm not the easiest target. Let's say you want to steal my wallet by cracking into my system (e.g. breaking passwords, infecting my systems with malware, exploiting a security bug) or coming to my house.
 Breaking Passwords
All of my passwords are at least 15 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and no dictionary words or similar alternatives. Basically they look like gibberish. The only weakness I can think of here is that I don't change them as often as I should. Guess what I'm doing this afternoon.
 Malware
I don't run any version of Windows or OSX, so your options are limited. My hardware firewall runs malware detection, so anything I try to download is checked. My Android phone and tablet could be vulnerable, but I only keep a little bit of bitcoin on the phone. Also, they can only connect to the wifi AP on my DMZ network. My secure network with my NAS and desktop system are protected from my DMZ network.
 Security Exploits
Let's say you're looking for security vulnerabilities in my networks and systems. Generally I try to minimize the programs and services running on my devices to only the ones I actually use, and I check for updates and install them daily. You'll have to hack your way through:
* A hardware firewall running network intrusion detection and malware detection.
* A network switch to my DMZ network.
On my DMZ network you have access to devices like my Nest, Roku, TV, Xbox, and wifi AP. You'll need to keep going to get to my secure network to claim your prize.
* Another hardware firewall to my secure network.
* Another switch.
Now you're on my secure network. The only two systems here are my desktop computer (running Linux) and my NAS (running FreeBSD). I've locked down ports to the bare minimum (e.g. ssh and cifs on my NAS). Both systems use full disk encryption, and are running intrusion detection software. Root login is disabled; you'll have to break in as another user who has sudo privileges. In the browser on my desktop I use plugins like HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, etc.
 Coming to My House
Maybe you could break in, and steal my computers (again, they use full disk encryption). First you'll need to find out where I live, which is a bit harder since all my Internet traffic flows through my hardware firewall, which maintains a VPN connection. It might look like I'm in Texas or Kansas or Seattle, but I'm not. Search my reddit history and you might find the state I live in.
My name is not really Enrique Montalvo. I'm a white dude with a name like Bob Johnson. I keep a separate browser profile for this pseudonym that has never been associated with me IRL. Enrique Montalvo has a gmail account, Twitter account, etc. I'm still trying to figure out how to get a truly anonymous phone so I can get a Facebook account. I may be good, but I'm not yet a Rembrandt!
If you somehow figure out where I live you'll have to get through my physical security (e.g. alarm system, camera, dog).
I keep a 5TB encrypted USB drive with backups of my data in a gun safe in the basement. The most important two words in that last sentense are "gun safe". ;) It's bolted to the concrete floor. The USB drive contained within could be up to a week out of date, but it will have a copy of my wallet. You'll need the safe combination and a physical key to open it, or maybe just a big-ass plasma cutter.
You could try social engineering your way in, but I'm a slightly paranoid introvert with trust issues.
You could try kidnapping and torturing me for the entire 16 BTC, but when I'm home I'm armed. If you take me by surprise (and we both survive) then I'll just give you what you want. You earned it. You better sweep the bitcoin into your own wallet and hold onto me until the transaction is confirmed, otherwise I'll just sweep it into a new wallet of my own. Or just kill me, then I'll have bigger problems to worry about.
 One Does Not Simply Walk Into Enrique Montalvo's Wallet
If you have my wallet, congrats! Just figure out the password for it and you're all set.
I may have left out some important details in all of this that would make things even harder for you. ;-)
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:47:26
I don't have an answer for you, but now I'm really curious how you *did* acquire your bitcoin! Assassin or prostitute are my initial guesses.
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:58:38
I haven't used paper wallets, so I'm not familiar with how those work, but in general a wallet holds your private keys. These keys are proof of your ownership of bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't actually "contained" in a wallet. Your ownership of any bitcoin is recorded on the blockchain. As long as you have the private keys you can use your bitcoin.
If a thief transfers your bitcoin somewhere else, the only way to recover it is how you would recover stolen cash. You have to go after them legally. Good luck with that!
If you lose your keys, all is lost. At that point you are no different than anyone else who doesn't have access to the private keys. Your bitcoin are zombied. I heard an estimate that 25% of all bitcoin are zombied.
The main concern I would have with bitcoin insurance is the possibility of fraud. A bitcoin insurance company would need to verify your real world identity so they could go after you legally. You would need to prove your ownership of any bitcoin you're insuring. Then if you ever filed a claim they would have to monitor the blockchain to make sure those bitcoin were never spent. For this reason I think they could only insure against loss, not theft.

My personal information and that of my family and close friends was stolen in the OPM hack. The federal government was charged with protecting that information, and they failed. How can we expect them to secure anything if they can't even secure the data of the people charged with protecting our nation? There's no way in hell they'll be able to do anything like this correctly and securely.
I feel betrayed, and vulnerable because it puts me and my family and friends at risk. I don't feel safe traveling abroad anymore, because I don't know who's list I might be on. I don't feel safe at home because somewhere out there someone knows my affiliations, knows where I live, and knows who they could hurt to try to make me do things.
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:52:01
Surprise, surprise. A central bank wants you to avoid using the thing that could eliminate their purpose. Large organizations will always attempt to protect themselves.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:05:52
You can double check the transaction on blockchain.info if you ever want to see whether it's a problem with your wallet or not.
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:53:58
It's probably taking long because you didn't provide a reward for processing your transaction. What's the transaction ID? We can look it up on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:21:13
I think they've always been stupid. You're just getting wiser.
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:40:11
Average time for the initial confirmation for bitcoin is designed to be about 10 minutes, so 30 does seem a bit long.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:59:05
Do you have the transaction ID?
@_date: 2015-12-20 06:45:35
I don't use a cold storage. I have 16+ btc using a wallet on my desktop computer, 1.5 btc in Coinbase, and a small amount using a wallet on my android phone.
@_date: 2015-12-20 23:26:56
I use Coinbase to buy bitcoin, then send it to my own wallet. Is there a better, safe, reliable, convenient way to buy bitcoin with USD?
@_date: 2015-12-20 06:41:00
Interesting. I transferred a few small amounts and a large amount to my own wallet on my own computer, and Coinbase asked me if I was transferring to another online marketplace on the last transaction. I answered honestly (NO) and haven't been shut down.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:51:44
FYI, wallets don't contain bitcoins. They contain the private and public keys that are used to prove ownership of bitcoins that are recorded in the global distributed public blockchain. I wish they weren't called wallets, because it's the wrong metaphor.

According to businessinsider.com the Bitcoin price "crashed" after the announcement. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
[They even gave us a chart]( SMH
My god, it's back down to the price it was all the way back in... two weeks ago! /s
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:29:01
We could argue that long confirmation times are self-imposed because certain people refuse to expand the block size.
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:31:17
I would love to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, but long transaction times hinder that. So maybe most people use it as a store of value because it sucks for anything else.
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:19:54
Rather than telling you "you shouldn't/can't", the real answer is that it's extremely difficult to make a profit mining Bitcoin. If you have access to large amounts of very cheap or free electricity then you might be able to make something.
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:38:14
Have you violated [one of these](
@_date: 2016-11-13 04:24:21
Democrats want to pass amnesty and anchor baby laws. Granting citizenship to illegals would definitely increase the base of voters for the Dems. Trump in office will prevent those laws from passing.
@_date: 2016-11-13 02:32:35


I think that's a false assumption with Trump. He's said all the things that the elites *don't* want, but they couldn't shut him up because he self-funded and isn't influenced by them.
This election was about immigration. Elites want nothing more than a lot of extremely low-wage immigrant labor, and Democrats want immigrants dependent on public assistance in their voter base. That's why he was reviled by *both* parties, could say whatever he wanted, and *still* won the election!
