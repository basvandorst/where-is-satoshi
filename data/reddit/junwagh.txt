With regards to your natural gas example, I suspect you are talking about the futures market.  In that case the good being supplied and demanded is contracts for future purchases of natural gas.  If companies expect to have more supply in the future, it makes sense for the price on the future natural gas to go down **in the future**.  The supply *is* changing when you view the market in the proper timeframe. 
Price is a function of supply and demand.  Your distinction between expected demand and demand right now is still eluding me.  
Speculators expect demand to increase.  Thus they demand more bitcoins.  The price rises.  The increase in demand led to an increase in the price of bitcoins.  How is that mechanism flawed?

This is the second time in this thread you have said this and I don't understand what you are saying.  Demand *is* fueling the price increase.  That is how the price mechanism works.  Price increases when either demand rises or supply falls.  An unexpected increase in demand is still an increase in demand.  Speculation still results in an increase in demand.  I don't understand the distinction you are trying to make between an increase in demand and speculation.  
Also, in the case of bitcoins the supply we are interested in with regards to pricing is not the supply of bitcoins in total, but the supply of bitcoins from people who are willing to sell bitcoins.  So it's not really "known" in the sense you are talking about (in the sense that we know how many bitcoins are in existence).  And because of the deflationary nature of bitcoins, that's an important distinction to make I think.
