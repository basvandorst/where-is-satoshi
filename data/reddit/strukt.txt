If you try to sign up for an account there you will get a question if you are going to use it for cryptocurrency. If you answer yes, you won't be allowed an account there.
The irony ��

I think you get a questionnaire, and one of the questions are crypto - related. If you answer yes, then nope. No account for you my good sir.

We have another bank here in Norway called "Sbanken". They actually incorporated coinbases API so you could see your Coinbase balance right next to your regular FIAT accounts. They have closed the feature now though.
So the banks are different here for sure... but where we are going in the future banks are irrelevant anyways, right...? ;)

Same in Norway. No fee of transferring money between banks in the country. As far as I have experienced.
Sending money out from the country costs a little though. Last time I sent a payment to Coinbase I paid about USD 2.5 in fees. Not that bad.

Plan to own a whole coin as well, only 0.45942542 to go! :D

People are asking me as well. I just tell them: do your own research and go for it. And maybe expect to loose your money. 
I never recommend anything, I only give practical help if needed. Such as setting up wallet, buying, etc.

Hah, how convenient. PoE is basically the only game I play on my PC nowadays. They have really understood how to make micro transactions useful.

If you can handle loosing all of your money then yes. Buy.
If not, just buy some global index funds.
