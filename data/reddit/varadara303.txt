I'm amazed at how slow everything is going. You must be new, and yes promises were definitely made, and definitely not kept, the team definitely did not deliver, and that's why 2017 had hugely embarrasing for the community insane fees.

Store of value was invented in summer of 2017, by the investors to have something to answer to people who were interested, when they ask "Whats so good about bitcoin?", since everything else was in state of observable failure.
1. Brutal fees, making it the most expensive way to transact money.
2. Inconvenient, making it the least convenient way to transact money.
3. Traceability, making it the least anonymous transaction method.
It is very hard to get people to recognize or talk about this here, in the lowest echelons  of the social aspect of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but elsewhere too. It's too frightening to see I guess. People want to make the money ASAP and GTFO, and they ignore the problems listed on purpose, and do not talk about it, and go about how it's store of value..
But if we were not sedated by the gains, like we are about to be sedated again, and instead gave heat to whoever runs Bitcoin so they finally quit being such faggots.. eh.. the world would have a been better place by now.
