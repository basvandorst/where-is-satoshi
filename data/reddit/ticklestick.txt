I've done three deposits, the first two were on my account at Kraken within 36 hours.  I'm still waiting on my latest (and largest) deposit but it's only been 2 days.
I emailed support and they came back to me within two hours, Oscar in support was very polite and helpful. He said he had actually gone and checked to see if they had received it.  He confirmed that the deposit hadn't hit their bank yet.
TL;DR I am very very happy with the trading platform and their support and would highly recommend them.

Have you tried Kraken.com?  I found their verification process easy yet thorough and i really like their advanced trading options as well as the ability to trade altcoins as well.  SEPA transfers are very very quick and the support seem to respond quickly (well relative to gox anyway).

latest news from Gox:
"Thank you for the email. Our bank in Poland made some modification on their web interface without informing us and unfortunately we are not able to import deposits in MtGox database since the 20th of November. We are working on solving this issue with the bank. We will keep you updated once we locate the deposit.
We apologize for the delay and the inconvenience that may have caused"

I am a massive fan of Kraken, it offers the best trading options i have seen anywhere.  The verification only took a few days and  I have had SEPA deposits get there in as little as 24 hours.  The layout is nice and the features easy to use.  The only downside is the perceived lack of volume.  I think it has a big future.

It certainly begs the question, why does anyone bother using it?
