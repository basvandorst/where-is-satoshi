Is there a cheap netbook/laptop that you would recommend? There are several Bitcoin ATMs in my city. Do I have to bring anything to them when I do this? Cheers

when you say buy bitcoins only with cache what does that mean?
edit: sorry for noobness
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:01:38
Haha I realized once he said cache from atm. Was confused for a second

can you use tails on iphone? have comp also just curious. also is it more secure to use bitcoin atm and deposit cash into it instead of linking? im assuming this leaves less of a trail
