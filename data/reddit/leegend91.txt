 u just admitted that the gold (or silver) is more demanded by people than citboin or bitcoin(which is utopia).
also if you dont got any internet, how u going to send your shitcoins abroad? 
am i missing something here?
do coinz fly through wifi to wiif? jk no. 
history keeps telling yall that the gold and silver is the only shiz people want.
even bitcoin riches prolly buy golds at last with their coins lol
