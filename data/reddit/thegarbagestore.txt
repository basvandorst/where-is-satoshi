This is absolutely not true.    I paid off my student loans with an initial investment of $1500 in it.

Ulbricht was exactly the kind of scum we don't want associated with Bitcoin.   He set the currency back several years and almost got it banned.   I hope his existence consists of nothing but suffering.

Every penny shouldn't go to a retirement plan anyway, you should have moderately accessible assets for emergencies

Don't use those guys, use The Crypto CPAs.   I had zero problems with them.

Can you handle BTC's 600% losses, though?   I know what you're thinking, pal.  You're like "Six hundred percent loss?   That's mathematically impossible, I can't lose 600% of what I'm risking."   Just wait and see.

This.   If crypto won't voluntarily deplatform hate speech users, gun dealers, and other unethical people, we need to deplatform crypto.   Take away the banking for the exchanges.

If the crypto community won't come together against bigotry and white supremacy, they themselves deserve to be deplatformed.   The banks should take away the exchanges' access to fiat deposits and withdrawals.

You don't know what you're talking about at all.
1) Blackrock is not a hedge fund, they are a publicly traded investment management company who sells ETFs
2) Blackrock is huge and famous and has a legendary reputation.   If you haven't heard of them, you don't know this sector.

It was a real shitsucker of a day for bitcoin

Do you really think Coinbase Custody stores those funds in a hot wallet?

If they don't come to a consensus soon there will be one coin under Vitalik, indivisible, with Lambos and smart contracts for all.
