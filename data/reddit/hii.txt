Do yourself and stop replying to this person. It seems the only passion he has is hating!

I really wish I could see their faces when they get that light bulb moment. Someone needs to make a gif of their faces when they have that epiphany

Why does the graph always go up and then always goes down? Why isn't there ever a horizontal part? It's like it always decreases ever 2 weeks and then increases. Seems like robotic behavior. I really don't understand how it's so consistent
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:33:31
is that paint blocking the words?

Jinxed! Dammit!

not trying to be negative, but i bet that's one of the last natural places in the world. after this, the world will have been raped.
i guess it would have eventually gone this way without bitcoin too. so meh

Ripple isn't fully decentralized like Dogecoin block chain. That's all. You're still right though. Many choices
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:47:03
It's amazing how obvious it is they are trying to "fork" bitcoin to prop up the failing dollar :(

I agree with you but I think his point about fees is there's no middleman who's taking a cut (banks or credit card companies)
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:45:51
Nice name! How did you decide on name?

He's only been there 1 year. They're obviously sending a newbie who doesn't even know the real impact of his organization

That's the free market. Probably 2-3 years from now people will trade to an altcoin like dogecoin, make the transaction instantly and then transfer back to BTC instantly with minimal price variation.

Good job, this will help the economy of Bitcoin and especially people uncomfortable and scared of having paper wallets. Will still take some time for people to trust this (only because it may be hard for the masses to understand right away with these used technologies) but I'm sure they eventually will :)

It's great to see big companies understanding the fundamentals of bitcoin rather than the usual gossip
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:48:05
The free market will come up with better solutions for the long run. I'm willing to wait

You can do it with Cash &amp; Gold to an extent. Can you really move $10 million of gold or cash without trusting someone?

The guy at the end said "they will use bitcoin because their competitors are using bitcoin" as if it was not a profitable thing to do. Tony schooled him well on transaction costs :D

I don't know why so many haters. This is awesome :)
