I appreciate your response.  Originally I just didn't completely understand due to how I was reading the wording.  
Life being a zero sum game seems like just a belief, does it not? Is that knowable? Life not being a zero sum game could also be a belief.  
Would you agree that the most open minded and honest perception would be that we don't know whether it is a zero sum game? I'm open to discussion. Maybe sometimes I cling to certain beliefs while other times I don't.  
I'm definitely on board about getting out of the box. I'm cultivating along with a group that is working towards spiritual immortality. ( [theimmortalpath.com]( )

i'd say it's good. Likely safer than any exchange.. but the hardware wallets are both a bit safer, and also the safest option (all my opinion)
