No it hasn't. I would want to know if I was depositing with a chance for the deposit to go missing. I wouldn't rely on a company to manage it for you. Companies don't give a shit about people.

It's troubling to me. I don't like it. They could attempt to screw me.

Yeah, I went there first actually. Just seemed rather dead.

Few posts up. I didn't accuse them of stealing.

It was just a btc address to send funds too for an agreed amount. Here is the blockchain for 200 usd, to the wallet it was suppose to go to.

I think the system doesn't work correctly. It was stated it is automated but the rep didn't really know what he was talking about. The system has something wrong with it and needs to be fixed. 
That's all I know. Maybe they are trying to steal money, but, why would they go after only 200$?

I'll be doing that if it can't resolved. I have everything saved for now.

Don't tell this to future investors, that they will have to screenshot ever transaction for proof.

Did you get your money back? I managed to do so.
