what took you so long? maybe the government should charge him with murder or a conspiracy charge if they they have a case against him. the only people charged with crimes in this case are the agents investigating him.
edit: dozens of comments per day and you can't respond to this? i guess it's not worth wasting the precious time you have sitting on your ass if you can't take the comment and post it in buttcoin with some incredulous remark.

[This one. The one above the Forbes article and second in the search.]( Funny that the Forbes article is already going with a revisionist retelling.


Are there there more than six murder-for-hire charges? One I'm missing?
[I also like this reference,]( the charges were used to deny bail and reasoning for a life sentence even though there was never and never will be any trial. If prosecutors are convinced as the judge is in the New York case that he is guilty why not try him?
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:17:15
I don't know, can you read?
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:18:03
What about them? The charges were dropped. Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges, the two investigating him, were indicted for wire fraud, theft of government property and money laundering.
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:10:03
thanks for linking a year old report, i'm sure you think it's quite relevant and yes i am aware that there were two sets of indictments against him. the people investigating him in maryland are the ones on their way to jail, the charges brought against him by the baltimore investigation are dropped, just read the forbes article in the search results, it's much more relevant to the conversation than the ancient references you seem to be digging up.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:20:06
find it yourself, or are you able to find reference to articles from years ago? i did provide a link to a google search, read the forbes article from the 29th. your selective reading of my comments is not my problem.
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:45:08
[Fine, let me google that for you,]( so you have his indictment on hand but know nothing about recent developments. OK, there bud.

as long as people are paying fees for the txs it's not spam and are doing so at their expense. if your intention is to fill up blocks arbitrarily be prepared to pay for the privilege. txs without fees will be dropped at the discretion of the miners.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:35:06
so, another 20 just for good measure! i'm sure the judge has all sorts of things on his mind, he can opt to give him a full sentence or not, but he's not going to get any extra jail time for crimes he hasn't been tried for.
but honestly though, i'm worried your reading comprehension is low. the thread OP pointed out what he perceives to be a tragedy to which you reply that murder-for-hire is not. do you mean to say that murder is in fact not a tragedy at all, is it that you support murder? you're obviously trying to stir the pot, maybe if you weren't such an idiot you'd manage not to contradict yourself in two sentences.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:27:54
Fine by me. Print all the money you want and funnel it into getting the bitcoin you need to fund your 'spam' attack. It would only do me good as an early investor for the demand to go up. Bitcoin has a finite supply, you would only serve to dilute the fiat you put in and inflate the value of bitcoin. I'm hosting a node regardless of the size of the blockchain, there will be no shortage of people committed to running a node as long as the incentive is there to protect their investment by keeping the network robust.

please share your statistics on the ratio of everyday users to developers. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:45:55
you're giving me another straw man argument, and everything i've been reading is in contrast to your comments. while there is consensus that building mechanisms to scale the network is required there is overwhelming opposition to doing this by simply changing parameters of the code, this instead requires real innovation and ideas. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:00:11
some schmo's thoughts on 0-conf transactions are in no way equal to that of a talented developer nor would i expect mine to be. anyone with the technical know how can do a pull request, that's how you vote, not with a slider on some shitty site. the mouthbreathing end user, myself not excluded, only has a a voice in what software they run. 
if your comment is on the bottom of a thread on reddit it probably means it is not worthy of consideration, and conversations on development here are not sold as a steppingstone to final commits. consider.it only serves to promote politicking and is not conducive to technical conversation that leads to meaningful changes and development.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:15:33

I didn't see it cause it never came up, what I was replying to was in fact an opinion. Maybe you're confused because it wasn't your comment I was replying to at all. I appreciate your advice on taking some lessons, even if it came form a place of repressed anger, but since you don't seems to be able to comprehend the context of a single sentence in relation to yours I think I'll hold off on taking your advice on lessons in logic. Also, maybe brush up on the proper use of quotes, we all stand to benefit from an improvement in your use of grammar.
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:07:00
I don't care to whom you though you were replying, trying to justify your lame use of quotes and preaching for lesons in logic won't get you a favourable reply in any situation. Don't be surprised you got a reply in the same tone.

@_date: 2015-07-23 13:20:50
Friendly? I think you misspelled indignant. At least lesons is in the ballpark. And quotes are not used to bring emphasis to a word. It's wrong and you bring shame to your family when you keep trying to justify their use. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:34:01

OK, wow. Good effort.
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:11:37
just no. we'd have the same problem at a different threshold. what would you do then? double the blocksize again, and again? there are much more elegant solutions to this champagne problem.

hate to break it to you but it seems there is no traction to any alternative. feel free to run a classic node. there is nothing stopping you. i don't care what faction you've aligned yourself with, i only care about reasonable proposals.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:48:31
there's no way you could be that stupid. since there's no increase at the moment of txs with fees waiting to be confirmed it would make no identifiable difference presently. and if the blocksize were to be increased in the future the arbitrary limit could just as easily and quickly reached and the mempool bloated. if that ever happens i'll just wait for you and other linear thinking simpletons to call for another doubling of blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:55:17
It's relative. It makes no difference to the individual if a crisis is global or localized in their region. And nowadays all crises are global. Leave the condescending tone for something you are actually knowledgeable about. I get the point you're trying to make, it's just stupid and irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:18:57
or less users with more transactions, who is to say the spam won't double? it's much more likely than a flood of new users.

and i *love* how your image of economic collapse is bread lines in soviet russia. your delusion is very cute. having lived through hyperinflation i know people will cling to whatever holds value, at the time it was german marks and hard goods like gasoline. if there was a currency free of government manipulation at the time you can be sure it would have taken off.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:37:45
it's stupid to think a simple increase in blocksize would solve the issue at hand. this backlog of transactions could happen just as easily with any limit. i see no real solutions for the increase in bandwidth and storage particularly for developing world participants. proponents of a blocksize increase are quick to point out the need for the developing world to participate in the ecosystem but forget their limitation in internet infrastructure and the expense of equipment when arguing for no fee micro-transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:09:53
The problems of bigger blocks include slower propagation and raises concerns of centralization. It is disingenuous to say increasing the block size will not have any side effects. It's business as usual with my bitcoin, my transactions are going through and my node is running optimally. The false dichotomy here is thinking that double the blocksize equals double the throughput.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:53:21
this not a problem that can be postponed. the mempool can be filled just as easily at any threshold without delay. you seem to have a very basic understanding of game theory and how it relates to bitcoin, bad actors don't just suddenly disappear once you've raised the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:45:49
