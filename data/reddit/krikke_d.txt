a bit is 0.000001BTC = 1 microBitcoin
yesterday was my first day as a (micro)BTC owner so i'll give you a 101 of them :)
101 bits @_date: 2014-03-28 12:19:49
true, but i do wonder how everything will evolve towards the "stable value" for a bitcoin (i.e do i pay 2 bitcoins for a smartphone or 2000 bitcoins ?).
my gut tells me due to the limited supply of bitcoins it will be significantly more than it's valued at today, unless bitcoin never reaches the majority of the population...

just got a wallet and going to give this a shot with 50eur + whatever bits rain down on me :) .
recently overheard someone in a significant role at a swiss bank say: 


curious about this, I tried to understand [the whitepaper]( figured that bitcoin is NOT a centralized entity that someone can "buy" or control and concluded that I should probably get into bitcoin while it's still in early adoption and most of the  financial world are still vague about how it works :-). 
hopefully i will never have to exchange the BTC back to Eur...
TL;DR: going for BTC with baby steps
