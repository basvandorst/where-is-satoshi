The biggest difference is there was SUBSTANTIALLY more trust between participants back then.  Heck, my first purchases of Bitcoin were via Paypal and Western Union and they went without a hitch.  There really hadn't been much scamming and it was a close-knit community for the most part.  Then the rise of the alts changed all of that.

Factom anchors into Bitcoin every 10 minutes.  This increases the utility of Bitcoin substantially and should be encouraged and supported by the Bitcoin community.  Bitcoin is the most secure network in the world and other protocols that tap into that (and pay fees to do so) only make Bitcoin that much more valuable to the world.

To expand further, we all know Bitcoin is starting to scare governments.  The more utility tied to the Bitcoin network, the harder it will be for governments to take action against it.  Bitcoin isn't designed to secure huge amounts of data.  But protocols that are such as Factom which then leverage the security of Bitcoin (and pay miners fees) provide utility that can be used to showcase the importance of Bitcoin to the world.  It also increases the economic sustainability of Bitcoin as block rewards decrease.

Lacking oversight hampers recordkeeping, resulting in costly reiterations, errors, and even safety risks for patients and consumers.


Triall will be entering data into the Factom Protocol which anchors its data into Bitcoin every 10 minutes.  This means the data from a clinical trial will be secured by Bitcoin which showcases additional utility beyond a store of value or payment rail and increases its value to the world.

Folks, if we're not able to communicate this technology, this movement to people in a manner where the normal person is able to understand, we have a problem.  They don't need to know the intricacies of the technology or mining, but they do need to know why it's important and why they shouldn't dismiss it immediately.
Let go of trying to sound smart and come up with explanations people will understand.
"Bitcoin is digital money where everyone is the bank and everyone holds the bank records without being able to steal from others.  It is a highly disruptive technology that we should all care about as it has the potential to improve the world"  Come up with your own explanations for the audience you are speaking to.

Even **IF** futures trading and corresponding shorting results in the price of BTC being driven lower in the short term, HODL.  I will personally continue to make regular purchases of BTC.  Because the reality is, at some point, those shorts piling on are going to get squeezed in a big way if we remain strong.

In time, governments will begin making all their documents including car titles verifiable via blockchain so that counterfeits and other fraud becomes a thing of the past.  Factom is a crypto perfectly poised for this and it benefits Bitcoin as it anchors into Bitcoin every 10 minutes and pays miners fees.

I think you misunderstand reserve currencies.  There are many with the dollar and euro being the major ones.  Others include the pound, franc, yen, yuan, and canadian dollar.  Reserve currencies are simply currencies held in reserve by governments for various reasons.
Gold is a known store of value and governments holding it has been important for ages.  As we all know (hopefully) Bitcoin may usurp gold as that safe haven asset with little to no counterparty risk.
If the USA suddenly came out and said no more Bitcoin, the potential economic advantages other countries could enjoy by buying up Bitcoin and utilizing it as a reserve currency and store of value should not be discounted.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:03:14
If the USA bans Bitcoin, every country in the world that dislikes the USA even a tiny bit will make sure it becomes the next reserve currency and store of value.
Holding Bitcoin and mining is now a matter of national security.

That's not correct and the Bitcoin community would be well-served to understand that blockchains like Factom utilizing it actually adds tremendous value to Bitcoin.  Just as TCP/IP wouldn't be near as valuable to the world without www utilizing it, Bitcoin becomes more valuable as blockchains like Factom utilize the strength of its network to perform tasks Bitcoin isn't optimized for.
Factom is a publishing platform built specifically for data that enables proof of process and auditing. Every 10 minutes, Factom anchors a merkle proof into the Bitcoin blockchain via OP-RETURN.  The consensus algorithm Factom employs is what will allow it to scale to be a global utility for data integrity. If Factom used Proof of Work like Bitcoin this would not be possible. Factom’s consensus algorithm ensures that all actors are acting properly in real time. Factom utilizes the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure that data is immutable. By leveraging currently existing blockchains to provide the security, Factom is able to maximize the utility of its protocol. To use an analogy, Factom hires the best, most secure, most trustworthy auditing firm in the world to oversee its data so that everyone knows they can trust it. 
As data from around the world is validated by Factom, it is concurrently secured by Bitcoin which makes Bitcoin that much more valuable of a network.

They shouldn't stay out of it. They should acquire sufficient amounts as cheap as possible where, if it does indeed become a reserve currency, store of value, and/or settlement layer, they're ahead of the pack.  At this point, it is quickly becoming a matter of economic and national security.

I don't have a sell point.  I'm in it to the point where people realize they don't need to sell, and beyond.
I don't think most people realize what, "HODL" truly means.  If we all HODL we don't have to sell.  Ever.  We simply utilize as necessary.
Bitcoin is an opportunity for there to be a world-altering transfer of wealth.  If we don't all HODL, then all that will happen is your Bitcoin will be purchased from you as you acquire crap you don't actually need and before long, you'll be right back where you started.

Chase's business, or the financial services industry generally, unless you are authorized
to do so. "

In addition to being a global, decentralized, trustless, deflationary currency in an inflationary world, Bitcoin will be the settlement layer of the new crypto-economy. In addition, it is the most secure and trustworthy network in the world which creates a host of opportunity for additional layers to be built upon it (think of it sort of like all the layers we have built upon TCP/IP). For example, technologies like the Factom Protocol can use Bitcoin's op_return to submit a merkel proof of their own blockchain to secure it further. What does the Factom Protocol do? It allows for true data integrity and identity security. An example application being built upon the Factom Protocol which is enabled by Bitcoin:  (It will revolutionize the mortgage industry).
My point is, based upon the current information you had, I understand why you think you do. But I invite you to further delve into just what Bitcoin and emerging cryptocurrency technologies will allow us to do as a species and you may come to understand this is not a bubble, but something that is still in its' infancy.

I bought Overstock stock awhile back purely due to its' work with cryptocurrency.  I'm strongly considering a large stake in IBM for the same reason.  They seem to get it better than any other large company.  The 4.16% yield is nice too.  Yes, I realize 4.16% is laughable in current crypto scene, but I believe in a diversified portfolio.
**[Edit]** Based upon IBM's move today, I should apparently start a newsletter.

There's a lot of companies working on blockchain but IBM seems to be going all in.  Considering their lead role with Hyperledger, I think they, "Get it" more than most and in time, it could lead to a massive reversal of that revenue decline.  Which consequently is another reason I rather like my investment idea... IBM is far from their ATH but is taking steps to lead the next technological revolution.

For the record, my new call is that Factom (FCT) will be the next big thing and COMPLIMENT Bitcoin as its' data integrity layer.

It's not its' own blockchain, it's an app that is blockchain agnostic.  They're using Bitcoin to insert into because it's cool and good way to get noticed.  However, if they're ever successful and need to secure volumes of diplomas of documents, I suspect they'll end up using Factom (which anchors into Bitcoin) as Factom is developed specifically for this purpose and is substantially cheaper than Bitcoin while still tapping into the computational security of Bitcoin in an amicable way.
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:26:29
I was about to post that they have a beneficial symbiotic relationship.  My hope is that more Bitcoin holders (which I am) start to see that there are a tokens out there like Factom that can act in the same manner.
