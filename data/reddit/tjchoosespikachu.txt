Hodl is just hold misspelled.  Hodor is a character from Game of Thrones that can only say his own name.  Hodor kind of looks like hodl.
At least I think that's what that's all about.

I never noticed that!  Thank you for pointing that out.

But couldn't you say the same thing about early adopters of any successful stock like Google and Apple?  Early investors took a big risk by investing in something that just as easily could have failed, and big risk has generated them a big reward.

Thank you for sharing this.  Could you give us the date/time that you received the email?

Turn on email verification for withdrawals.  This makes it so that all withdrawals require you to respond to an email before they get processed.  This means that nobody can run off with your money unless they have access to both your BTC-e account and your email account.  This isn't a widely known feature, but it is a very important one.
Please note that you have to verify your email address before you can turn this on.  For some reason, the email address that I initially used to sign up with was not receiving any emails from BTC-e, but then I switched it to another email account and I was able to receive emails from them and verify my address.
They recently switched from using your username and password to log in to using your email address and password, so make sure you're using the right one when logging in.  I have noticed in the past that their caching setup sometimes goes wonky and displays old versions of pages (especially in Safari on my iPad), so try clearing your browser cache.
Having said all that, there might be a good chance that your computer has been compromised.  Clean your computer or have someone else do it for you.  There are a lot of users trading on that site (just going by the user numbers listed below the troll box) and it seems that only a small handful of you guys are publicly reporting to have any security problems like this.  Like it was said in another post here, there are people with $XX,XXX amounts of cash on BTC-e, and if there was a security problem on their side, then it seems like a thief would go after those accounts first over the ones with nothing in them.

What program/website is pictured in this screenshot?

Does anyone else find it funny that this picture has more points (278 vs. 96) at the moment than the original BitSafe photo that this originated from?
