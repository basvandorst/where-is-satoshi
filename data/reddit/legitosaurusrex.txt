Right, your cold storage isn't likely to be targeted by a hacker, but viruses can target any user. Yes, you can take steps to avoid them during your setup, but all I'm saying is there are tons of points of failure along your route to strong security. It's up to you if you think the risk that you make a mistake is lower than the risk of Coinbase scamming users or their cold storage being compromised, and if you think the time invested and lack of liquidity is worth that perceived lower risk.

Because I didn't say they were hacks, I said they lost money. You can call people idiots all you want, but the fact is it's a risk that even crypto-savvy people can make mistakes and lose money. Like [this guy]( who'd been in crypto since 2011 and was normally very careful. And [this guy]( and [this guy](
[This guy]( bought a ledger that was part of a scam.
I can't find it anymore, but I read a guy's story who said he was one of those super careful people who had 3 servers in different locations storing his recovery seed (or password, or something), all automatically being backed up, and then one day he had some issue where he needed the seed/password. But when he went to retrieve it he found that when he had changed the seed a month ago or so, the backup had overwritten the new seed with the old one on all three servers, causing it to be lost forever.

Why is this so confusing? Look at the comment by u/Subug that this chain is replying to...
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:46:21
Because there are tons of opportunities for the user to mess up while setting up the cold storage, chances for his device to be stolen, burn in a fire, flooded, etc, while Coinbase's cold storage is in a more secure and stable location with a well-tested procedure for use, and I'm sure they have plenty of backups in different locations.
The point is, you *could* do it all yourself to make it just as safe, but 99% of people won't make it to that level of security, and some will make a critical mistake along the way.
Why build your own vault and hire your own security when you can just use a bank?  
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:48:48
Coinbase also has security experts working to keep their systems bulletproof. 
But that risk doesn't even matter since they keep the vast majority of their assets in cold storage, so those aren't even at risk, and they have insurance on the coins in the hot wallets, plus FDIC insurance on money in USD wallets. I'd take my chances with them.

Tons of people were entering the arena during the dotcom bubble too. Lots of new users is par for the course for anything that jumps in value like BTC. All I'm saying is it isn't unique and impossible to trade like you were saying. Many people will try to win at trading, just like they do in the stock market, and just like the stock market, only few will succeed. There are obviously many people trading, otherwise there wouldn't be $10 billion+ being traded every day, even when the market cap stays mostly static.

Then what do you mean by Bitcoin's network effect being "dynamic and up to date"?
Hodling won't wipe out big money... all it does is help make the market more predictable.
Nobody sane thinks they can ever constantly win at trading anything. It's just a matter of being right more often than not, or making more money when you're right than you lose when you're wrong.
The vast majority of traders don't make money on the stock market. Only about 2% are successful over the longterm. There's no reason it wouldn't be the same with Bitcoin.
Successful traders in the stock market could apply their strategies to Bitcoin (and already are), since both types of assets have swings based on market sentiment.

Huh? You can short or long Bitcoin just like any other asset. Just because the price behaves differently doesn't make it not possible. And being long Bitcoin has paid off for plenty of people; go tell them you can't long Bitcoin. [Here's a list of exchanges]( where you can use margin to short Bitcoin. I'm sure many people have made a lot of money by shorting Bitcoin during downswings.
People have been playing it for years; they don't need many months to discover how.
And you're saying Bitcoin itself will adapt to people trading it and change again and again? Seriously? The price is controlled by people who buy and sell it, nothing else. Bitcoin itself doesn't adapt to that or change that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:04:27
So you're saying that the people who trade Bitcoin make up a network that keeps it dynamic and up-to-date relative to other assets, so those same people don't actually know how to play it (despite having made ridiculous amount of money playing it), so "one cannot short it, or even long it either"...

There's data recovery software that tries to recover deleted files, but it doesn't work all that great if you've used the computer a decent amount since the files were wiped. When data is actually overwritten, it used to be possible (like late 90's or so) to reconstruct it using the magnetic traces left over from overwritten data, but not with newer hard drives since the data is too densely packed. People like to speculate that the government has a way though.

Don't those transactions take forever to be committed though? Or is [everyone else just doing it wrong?](
If you're getting 2% cash back on your credit card, and you pay it off every month, you should beat inflation just fine if your country is doing okay.
But if you're that confident that Bitcoin will succeed, I guess it's logical to keep your money it. I just feel there are other coins that are or will be more functional than Bitcoin, and once they start being accepted in more places and especially if they catch up or pass Bitcoin in trading pairs on the exchanges, people will switch to  those currencies, and Bitcoin won't make a very good store of value if it doesn't have utility.

What do you mean nothing is for sale? The company is selling their shares/coins.
Here's a situation on the open market for you. An accredited investor sells a bunch of stock, even though that stock is going to go up 50% that year. He uses that money to invest in a project that's restricted to accredited investors, where he will make 100% that year. The people who buy his shares aren't accredited investors, so that investment isn't available to them, and the 50% is the best they can get. Nobody made a mistake.
There are plenty of situations similar to this. What about somebody who's selling for tax harvesting purposes? The tax benefits could make the trade profitable for them when waiting through the end of the year for an increase wouldn't be worth it, while the person who's buying could make money off that upswing. What about a day trader who buys and sells to profit off a quick swing, but the person he sold to was buying for the long term? And maybe the person he bought from needed to sell that day to get money for something but wasn't going to be able to access a computer later to sell, and couldn't risk setting a limit that the stock might not reach?
Edit: Regardless of any of these situations, a decision is made by taking into account the risk and reward. Say there's a 50% chance that a stock triples, and 50% chance it goes to 0. Investing in it would be a good decision because the outcome has a positive [expected value]( If you invest and it goes to 0, you didn't make a bad decision, you just got unlucky. On average you would've made money. You made the best decision based on the risk/reward.
Also, like other people have said, multiple people could be buying from a single seller, so many people could be making the right decision and only one person making the wrong decision.

Users can connect peer-to-peer if they want to... If by hubs you're talking about the actual hubs in internet infrastructure, then that's just ridiculous, cause who's going run like 15 billion internet lines into their house to connect to every other device on the internet?
If by hubs you mean servers, like those that serve websites and other content, then you're just wrong, because users don't have to connect to those if they don't want to. Just look at torrents. It's just more efficient for most applications to run off of a single centralized server.

It's unlikely regardless. And many of those people could have been doing illegal things, and there was enough evidence for suspicion but not enough for a conviction.
I dislike and disagree with civil forfeiture just as much as the next guy, but I haven't heard of any cases where the government seized all the assets of people who mostly weren't doing anything illegal, held by a company that wasn't doing anything illegal.
If Coinbase doesn't comply with court orders, I could see them being shut down, but even then I would think it likely that the government would give people a chance to get their money back first.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:43:51
If the company doing the ICO doesn't sell any coins, then there isn't a price and their coins are worthless. By selling the tokens, it creates a market where the price can rise, and the company can sell their coins on it. The company benefits from selling the coins, and the people buying into the ICO benefit when other people want to buy their coins on exchanges.
It's a similar situation when a company sells shares to raise capital. The capital is worth more to them than the shares, and the shares are worth more to the investor than the capital, so both parties made a good decision.

It's not hard, 50% of web traffic is encrypted. That's what HTTPS is. Basically anything important uses it.
Decentralized apps won't help defend against ISPs abusing their power if NN is gone. The FCC vs Comcast lawsuit was actually over Comcast throttling a peer-to-peer file-sharing, and the FCC lost.
Infrastructure will always be able to be interfered with by authorities. If it has a physical location, they can access it. They could just make a law that everyone who accesses the internet must agree to be monitored, and make all the modem manufactures only sell modems with monitoring firmware. And then track down anyone who connects with an illegal one.
Plus, even if you disagree with all that, decentralized internet infrastructure is ridiculously infeasible. There are about 10 billion devices connected to the internet. It would take 5 x 10^19 connections to connect each one to every other device. That's 50 *quintillion*. To put that in perspective, the 7.6 billion people in the world speak about 102 trillion words each day. If our population stayed at 7.6 billion, it would take 1335 years for 50 quintillion words to be said. There's absolutely no possibility of making that many direct connections unless we create wireless communication that can bend signals around the globe while using an insignificant amount of energy per connection.

It isn't literally pennies anymore... It's too expensive to use for small purchases, and it's still money that's being spent just for the sake of using Bitcoin instead of fiat or a credit card.


Or just use cash or a credit card, which everyone already has, or even another faster, cheaper crypto if it's also accepted.
Paying with a debit card doesn't give you the same protection or bonuses a credit card does. Sure, credit card fees get baked into prices, but all that does is discourage the use of anything but reward credit cards; it's a tragedy of the commons scenario.

Internet infrastructure hubs are just dumb switches that forward packets where they need to go. It's not even about feasibility, it's that there's literally no reason to try to remove them; it makes more sense the way it is. Have you taken any networking courses before? Same reason it doesn't make sense to try to build freeways to connect everyone's houses to every other house on the continent.


Sure, people can go ahead and research those things if they want. But there isn't much of a case for decentralized web applications being fundamentally better than centralized ones. They just present logistic and security challenges, and don't really provide many great intrinsic benefits over centralized applications.

How could climate change be insured against, since it's a global phenomenon? Insurance companies can only insure things that happen to small percentages of their customer base at a time, which also tend to be unpredictable. Since we're on a track towards climate change, there would probably come a point where it eventually becomes worth it for everyone in an affected area to get the insurance, since the the interim premiums will be less than the amount they're insured for, and at that point the insurance companies would want to stop offering it, like they do now with people with preexisting conditions.
Also, I don't think the insurance market would find their contributions to stop pollution would have a large enough affect on respiratory disease and stuff to recoup their money. They could try doing that right now if they wanted.

Yes, but I haven't had any issues with IOUs from banks in the past. Runs on banks are rare, and they're caused more by panic than an actual need for the money at that specific time. It's more than one extra step though if you have to buy a hardware wallet or fire proof safe or something just to get closer to the security fo the current system.
People hate losing money a lot, and any system which makes that a possibility will have a tough time with adoption. The average person doesn't care much about the IOU vs actual money thing when they both work the same way.

Sure, that sounds more reasonable than your "Income tax is theft" statement that started this argument. Though I will say I'm pretty certain that if you shift the tax burden away from income tax and towards corporate tax, it'll benefit the rich more than the poor or the middle class.


Obviously neither of those, though the Democrats typically want less military spending and more corporate taxes than the Republicans do. But there are other candidates in the primaries who may share your views as well as other parties; you'd have to convince people to vote for them, which would obviously be difficult even if everyone shared your views. The first step would probably be getting economists to agree that your plan would help the middle class, but I think they'd tell you what I did.


Not if you get citizenship in that country and revoke your American citizenship, which is what I meant... It's not for life, it's for as long as you're a citizen of the US and therefore enjoying the benefits of your tax dollars...

That's always what happens after bitcoin drops though.

Since you can't predict the future, but the general trend over these coins' existence is up, putting money in as soon as possible seems to be the best strategy. Unless you think TA actually works, in which case take out as much leverage as you can and make your free millions.
I'll admit to thinking I can beat the market just like many traders, and so far I've been mostly getting lucky. But luck is all it is when it comes down to it.


It's human nature to be more adverse to losing money than missing out on gains, but they're fundamentally the same thing if the only reason you didn't make the trade was to avoid losing money.

He was relevant when he caused the price to drop in the first place. If public figures can manipulate the price and profit off of its swings, it will be damaging to bitcoin's credibility and image, and therefore its adoption. Reducing market manipulation is important, and holding manipulators accountable for their actions is the first step. Giving people reputations as manipulators will help reduce their ability to manipulate in the future.

If I do read about it, I would probably also like to read some opinions of those on the opposite side of the spectrum, but thank you for the suggestions.

Actually, the US interest rate is currently at 1.25% and about to be raised again; I don't think it's one step away from negative. I don't think the fed has ever dropped the interest rate by over 1.25% at once, and they especially wouldn't when rates are already low, since that would be a huge relative change. Also, bank account interest rates are just whatever the banks feel like giving you and aren't related.
And sure, Bitcoin has historically appreciated, but that doesn't mean it will continue to do so. Traditional investments have longer histories behind them. It's still a relatively risky investment in its current state, even disregarding the chances of losses from hacks/mistakes. It won't become widely used as a currency until it's relatively stable.

Anything anyone says about the future is what they think would happen... Nothing about the future can ever be a fact, just low probability.
If you replace personal income tax with corporate income tax, you'd have to quadruple corporate income tax to make up the difference. How could you think that's going to result in some companies just taking the hit, paying their employees the same amount, and offering products for the same prices? And people will drop any company that doesn't and go to the ones who do? It's just financially impossible. Companies would crumble if they tried that. Prices would rise and wages would drop, it's inevitable. How could you think that would benefit the middle class and result in the rich paying more taxes?
In regards to how we spend the taxes, maybe you need to run for office so you can change things or convince people to vote for different candidates who promise to make those changes. You may need to change how you discuss things with people though instead of alienating them by calling them "kid" or a coward and saying their views are garbage. Or you need to live in a different country. You're paying the tax because you live here and benefit from government spending.

I guess you could make the argument that the country is a commons and that nobody wants to take the time to learn what each candidate supports before voting, since the benefit that provides them individually is negligible, which leads to damage to the commons.
I think our current system can definitely be improved, but it's a heckuva lot better than anarchy and "volunteer funding".

That's always what happens after bitcoin drops though. It gets way oversold from panic-based selling and people trying to sell before everyone else does, and then eventually people realize it's on sale, a few whales jump back in, everyone buys to keep from missing out, then people are reassured that it's coming back, so the price recovers.
The only time we'll see a dead cat bounce is if Bitcoin is actually killed by some new development. Hence the "dead" part of that phrase.

That's the thing though, there's virtually zero risk in trusting banks, while there is a risk in trusting exchanges.
Have you seen the guides and how to be safe when setting up your wallet? You're supposed to have a fresh computer that's never been connected to the internet, then you jump through all these hoops to buy the crypto, the hardware wallet, transfer the crypto, get a safe deposit box, etc. Oh wait, you tried to skip a  step and a keylogger stole all your money. That's a lot of either hassle or risk to replace something we already have​, even if it is faster and better.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:48:05
Right, my points are so garbage you don't have any responses to them.
Quote me where I said things are fine the way they are. As I keep saying, our government is better than no government but can still be improved, and getting rid of income tax won't fix the current problems.
There wouldn't be employment elsewhere or different cheaper products if every single corporation was taxed the same!! They're already selling their products at a price which keeps them as competitive as necessary and protects their profit margins. Any company that could reduce its profit margin to gain market share would already have done so before the tax happened. 
The only exception would be if foreign products don't get hit by this tax, in which case, good job, you managed to kill what was left of American goods production and accelerated the outsourcing of services as well, that'll be great for the economy. And I pointed out the issue of monopolies in a free market; we can already see the effects of the effective monopolies we currently have. How many people like data caps on internet usage, but can't vote with their wallets because there aren't any comparable alternatives?
Taxation isn't modern-day slavery dude... And calling me a coward and telling me to gtfo off of a public forum? Grow up.

"scam"? It's obviously a disagreement about Bitcoin's direction... There's an entire sub that supports it. I hate how you can't even have a discussion about it on either sub, because both sides are too polarized and have abandoned the sub they disagree with.

I mean, if there were no laws, there would be raping and pillaging going on. People would just take what they wanted. And yes, companies would poison us if the FDA didn't force them to do tons of trials on new drugs, and implement regulations about what can be in our food.  You think stuff like asbestos, leaded gasoline and paint, and the banned pesticides would've actually been voluntarily removed by companies unfettered by governmental regulation? "Get real kid".
As to ripping us off, the FTC, BBB, and the other consumer protection agencies are all that stands between us and companies just ripping us off with nothing that we can do about it. "Sue them", you say? Oh wait, who's paying the judges and enforcing any judgments? Hmmm... How about "Competition will drive consumers to other companies!" Except for all of the companies which have effective monopolies, as well as all the monopolies that would form with no FTC to prevent them.
And sure, taxation loopholes need to be tightened to ensure everyone is paying the amount their bracket specifies. Getting rid of income tax isn't the answer. Anyone paying 34% in tax shouldn't be a "struggling American". They're solidly in middle to upper class, and if they're struggling with finances, they need to stop overspending.


Not sure what you mean by this; it doesn't matter if you said it, since the rich do get taxed more than the poor. The poor are paying less than 15% and personal deductibles help keep them paying even less. My point was that since the rich pay more income tax than the poor, removing income tax and making everyone pay the same amount on sales tax would hurt the poor far more. Also, the poor are mostly spending on essentials, and the sales tax on those are a much larger percentage of their income than it is for the rich.
And I'm not sure why you think I'm promoting trickle down economics; I'm arguing in favor of the poor and middle class being taxed less; it's just that removing income tax is counterproductive to that goal. [Here's an article if you don't understand what I'm saying.]

I dunno, any monetary system which requires something as ridiculous as that to be totally secure doesn't seem like a great replacement for the current banking/monetary system. The average person isn't going to do that kind of thing and will make mistakes, hacks and losses will happen, and people won't see crypto as a secure place to store money. Not trying to spread FUD, but these are the kind of things that worry me about the road towards widespread adoption.

Sorry, by "nonissue", I meant the issue of losing their deposits, not that it won't have an impact on everyday life. I'm just saying that question wasn't correctly answered, since 99% of people most likely won't lose their deposits due to the insurance.
You have a point about OLA and stuff not being tested, but they did successfully handle the FDIC insurance fund running out of money during the recession, and I'd bet they'll go to extreme lengths to make sure they continue to meet their obligations in the future.

A couple issues I see are that voters already have more information about candidates than they want to pay attention to, and the effect of policies on those quantitative measures is often impossible to predict and hotly disputed among experts, especially anything economic.

Back in June when Coinbase actually accidentally canceled people's orders, they gave us two months to decide if we wanted the orders to be reinstated, so if we bought below market price it would've come out of Coinbase's pocket. Luckily for them it was on its way down to $140 though.

What does "FUD" have to do with anything I said? I'm spreading FUD because I'm saying having a government with taxes that pay for services we use isn't a bad thing? Not everything you disagree with is FUD, lol.
Income tax nowadays is used for much more than wars to redistribute wealth. I'm not sure how its original purpose has anything to do with its current usefulness. The rich get taxed more than the poor, so you could say that income tax nowadays actually redistributes wealth from the economic elite to the masses.
The corporations will just pass on the tax to their workers by giving lower wages or charging higher prices... That wouldn't help the middle class. If the corporations charge higher prices, it would actually harm everyone who isn't rich, since the rich would be paying the same tax rates as the poor, since income level doesn't affect sales tax. With income tax, it's possible to give the poor tax breaks.

/btc has a pretty large and active community for being "a launching pad for such scams".
Not every hard fork is an attack by a scam artist... If Bitcoin isn't hard forked, it can't ever be majorly upgraded. If the core team are the only ones who have the "right" to control Bitcoin, then that just makes it a centralized currency.


Well, from what I've heard, Blockstream admitted to planning to monetize the offchain payments, which sounds like a centrally-controlled payment method to me. And without upgrades to network capacity, like 2x, offchain payments will become a necessity. Haven't heard anything like that from the 2x side.
And Coinbase has its issues, but is far from a shady company.
