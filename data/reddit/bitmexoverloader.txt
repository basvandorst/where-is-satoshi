Hello, yes. I'd like one thread, please.

I got banned from the politics subreddit for quoting Donald Trump's "If Hillary Clinton gets to pick her judges, there's nothing you can do, folks. Maybe the second amendment people can do something about it, I don't know" statement, when discussing the most recent Supreme Court appointment.
I'm talking as I would on my main account. If you want word from my 4 year old account, just say so.

I bought a 3DS with Bitcoin at $700. The price was really stable. I had a birthday coming up, and I thought to myself "I'm going to buy that back with my birthday money."
The price then rallied and it it never went below $700 again. I still have that Super Mario 3D Land special edition New 3DS.

I got pulled into the world of bitcoin by [this reddit ad]( It was late 2014 thought bitcoin was some sort of game. I didn't really understand what it was until 2015, when I bought my first 0.23 of bitcoin. Which I've fumbled, spent and poorly traded into my stash of 0.11 bitcoin I own now. It's been quite a ride :)

Also infinite power and raw materials.

It honestly feels like the price is a cooling spring. It's going to be a violent move, when it is released.

Prolonged stability periods like this tend to last no more than 3 months. So I'm thinking this particular one ends between today and December 9th of this year. [You can keep an eye on volatility here]( (the lower volatility, the higher the stability). I took a look at prices around April 19th 2016 (volatility was 0.74%) and October 11th 2016 (0.58%) in order to come up with that three month number. Current volatility is 1.71%, so it still has room for lower numbers.

I have a friend that just calls them "Bits".

I'm taking care of that thing until my dying day. A 0.26 bitcoin 3DS... I rarely ever use it, because of college workload (seriously, it's like they're more interested that I lose sleep than I learn their classes), but it's one of my most cherished possessions.
And I think that someday, I'll be able to make those 0.26 bitcoin back simply by trading. So I'm glad that I bought and used and fumbled my inicial bitcoin stash. Because now I know what to do. Now I know better :)

I really like these! Where can I get some? 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:48:23
$6826.3-$6094= $800?
Plus, the price has remained between $6200 and $6600 for most of that month. That's a range that's 7% wide. Quite stable, if you ask me.

Bitcoin will never submit.
Bitcoin will never die.

I honestly would prefer bitcoin. Because I can hedge my exposure to bitcoin's volatility, and if I'm lucky enough, turn a profit. With this stand, resale value is nil.

Quick question. What is a comparable monitor when it comes to specs? The most expensive non-bullshit seeming screens I can find are mostly under $1000, but I'm not sure how to compare them.
Edit: for example, I take a look at [this list of]( "the best monitors" and I can't really find anything that important to compare...

The guy that registered Mcdonalds.com gave it away in exchange for a $3500 donation to a single school. Could have waited a decade and sold it for more, could have gotten several dozens of schools the same donation and still have some profit left over.
Edit: hell they could have rented out the domain name to McDonald's and be raking in some serious cash from the start, but what they'd probably do is sue him for the domain. I dunno how that might have worked out.
Edit 2: apparently, so long as he sold/rented the domain in good faith at a fair price, the courts wouldn't take it from him. Not to mention that having written an article about McDonald's saying "we're not interested in registering a domain for ourselves", would help.

So, basically like that one movie?

Bitcoin is dead.
Long live bitcoin.

Dead.
