I don't understand how using Bitcoin will "defund the police state".  Even if everybody (including governments) switched to Bitcoin, wouldn't funding still be available through various taxes?

If I understand correctly, the problem it creates is the need to track capital gain/loss on each individual purchase.  That's a huge PITA.  But maybe  the functionality could be built into wallet software so that a report could be generated at the end of the year.

Thanks for the video link. Seems like it would be a step in the right direction but, in the end, it still boils down to the need for people to demand that certain government activities END. But, yes, I see the point that people will be more willing to do so when there's a direct personal impact if they don't.

How does this fit with stories about and analyses of the correlation between the US dollar and Bitcoin?  Try searching for "correlation us dollar bitcoin" for examples.

I don't get it, at all.  But I suppose there's even somebody out there selling a t-shirt with the words "Anti-Defamation League" with a swastika as the logo.

Suggested question: "Have you ever lost bitcoins, through theft, forgetfulness, or hardware failure?"

I wish I could stop "What What (In the Butt)" from playing in my head every time I see that logo.

I think it's a bit of a stretch to equate the set of users on a reddit sub with "the community" associated with the corresponding interest.

You won't pay a capital gain tax until the gain is realized.  That would happen when you spend or sell bitcoins.  If you've done neither, you don't have any realized capital gain/loss.
