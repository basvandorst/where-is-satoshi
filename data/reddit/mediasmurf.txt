Sadly you are right. And to be honest this is bugging me in general about crypto markets. It has become an investment tool, while it should be an open decentralized ecosystem to replace the current monetary system. People with disposable income are generally quite rich already, they can invest in crypto currencies and get richer. Most (hard working) are living from pay check to pay check, have no disposable income and they are left behind. While crypto currencies are meant to get rid of the elite, they are just creating a new elite. Personally I'm in the same situation as the topic starter. I've done very well in some investments, took profits over my initial investments and playing with a lot of house money now. My only addition is to diversify a bit. Bitcoin is great, but Bitcoin needs something like Litecoin for smaller transactions. And why not invest in smart contract blockchain technology like NEO or Ethereum? Having a diverse portfolio makes it a lot easier to sleep at night.

Although your arguments are correct I don't agree that it's a useless metric. It's representing the total value of all the circulating supply. Price is always moving based on supply and demand. If everyone wants to sell, then there will probably be more supply than demand, so prices will drop. This has nothing to do with market capitalization.

Basically most of Europe has done this already, when changing their local valuta to euro. I remember it myself. In the first couple of months many shops showed both the old and the new currency on the price tags or people used a little trick to quickly convert the amounts in their heads. All to get more feeling with the amount. After some months this goes away and people start forgetting about the old currencies.
I think for bitcoin the issue is that it's all decimals. Imagine asking how much a cup of coffee costs and the answer is _zero point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero thirtyfive_. I'm not sure if people like to use the name Satoshi either.

That's why I love Bitcoin. It reminds me of my kids.

Of course I know that this is by design, but in my opinion the design is flawed. Inflation is the process of devaluating the money. In this way you are paying for someone else's wealth. Your money becomes less valuable so someone else can have more money.
Sure the value of Bitcoin is fluctuating too, but this is not a design flaw. This is because people are using it (and even abusing it) as an investment tool. Once Bitcoin replaces the dollar with it's current dollar standard, the fluctuations will be much much less.

I think you are missing the point. Bitcoin was never meant to be an investment tool, that's just what the market made out of it. Bitcoin is meant as a utility token, cash. Something that is good in keeping value (like gold), while being able to transact fast and easy so you can make payments (like dollars).
What you are describing, how nobody would invest in cash, is because of some faulty properties of old cash (dollars). With Bitcoin, you wouldn't have this problem.

Also a common misconception is that Bitcoin needs a lot of computing power and energy to work. In theory Bitcoin can work with one single node that mines new blocks in the CPU.
If 95% of the miners would stop mining Bitcoin over the next couple of years, then the difficulty will be adjusted and the network will continue to run fine.

So 1/1,0000,0000th of a bitcoin?

The pile of cash though? Nobody wants cash if they can already have anything they want. But if you really do like piles of cash, then move to Venezuela! Cash is nearly free there!

I've watched enough Hollywood movies to know that the word cash is very common in the United States of America. Even here in The Netherlands and other European countries we use the word cash for physical money.

If you could control the whole bitcoin network, then it's not immutable either, just like if you control a whole other blockchain network it will not be immutable. The immutability doesn't come from PoW. It comes from sharing control and giving up majority.
If your company is setting up a private blockchain with for example six other companies, where all companies run their own node, then the data will be immutable unless you have a majority. I mean you can alter your own node, or even work together with another company, but you cannot change the data of all nodes in the blockchain unless everybody agrees.
Also if you want to change data, it won't go unnoticed if you have other stakeholders with a read-only node in the network. For example you can allow your customers to set up a node where they can keep a copy of all data locally.
In short, you don't need blockchain if you are the only user. In any other case it will give you added data security. The larger the network, the more security you can get.

In The Netherlands you can order food to be delivered at home and pay with Bitcoin. I have been using that for years now.

Since the total supply of Bitcoin is fixed, you'd have to adjust the total supply of people in the USA.

I'm not so sure if everybody being in full control of all their money is such a good idea. I think this is already a problem with cryptocurrencies, many people are just not capable of securing their own private keys. How to insure that? Maybe banks can play a role here?
