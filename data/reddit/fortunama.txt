Whitelisted bitcoin sellers would not be allowed to accept zerocoin for the same reason they would not be allowed to accept non-whitelisted bitcoin.

Assuming the merchant doesn't immediately convert the coins back to dollars anyway.

I will always accept 1 BTC for $1 USD. As many as you want.

Flat taxes are regressive on their own. Perhaps a middle ground would be [FairTax]( (tl:dr: charge 30% national sales tax at retail on everything BUT give all US residents a prebate equivalent to what one would pay in taxes at the poverty line -- $214/mo per adult based on 2012 numbers, for example). The problem is that tax evasion would be rampant under such a system, and bitcoin would make it impossible to enforce.

This was the realization that finally got me to buy in. The bitcoin protocol itself is open and can be changed as better ideas develop. The main value of bitcoin is the massive public ledger, and there is a lot of money invested in defending it. It'd be way easier to build user-friendly systems that interface with the bitcoin ledger (ex: BitPay, online wallets) than it would to make what amounts to an "alternate internet".

Bitcoin is not a stock.

Another way to mine bitcoins. Forget sha512 hashing, let's make people actually work for it. The harder the difficulty, the rarer the blocks.
