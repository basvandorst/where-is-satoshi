I gave up coding long ago, not exactly sure of how it would be done. Just seems like renting out servers to run nodes on hosting services would be better, I see people here talk about it. If needed, make something in the protocol that takes a % of the fee and sets aside to pay for pooled nodes or something.
I am very tired and am not going any further than that. I don't know where else to go with it either, but it sounds like it could be done if it isn't already.

Everything you typed was a long winded non argument. The irony!!!!

And so is bitcoin, but has 500x to 1000x the fees.

Would you change your mind if I switched to my main account of 2 years?
How does that change what I said at all? Hint, it doesn't

You are free to say and do what you want. Have fun with it.

bch has and could process 40k~ transactions every 10 mins. given one input/output per tx. btc does around 1/8th currently + a lil extra for segwit.
  37k transactions in one 8mb block
btc is and already has been monopolized by china for years my man. that is a fact. btg looks interesting despite the dev team pre mining. Maybe GPU mining will make a come back somehow.

I will re-word that a bit better. It could clear 40k~ every 10 minutes if they are all single output/inputs.
Here is a block where it cleared 37k transactions.
Still, that back log on BTC is insane and I am glad I don't have to pay fees any more. There is no reason in this day and age to pay more fees than Western Union on BTC. You might remember that meme from way back.

For a small fee he will tell you his secrets.

The incentive structure is there.
People who participate on BitcoinTalk come here(here I am too because I do).
People on BitcoinTalk want rBitcoin to continue to succeed, and also are largely pro segwit. 
People on BitcoinTalk are therefore(and myself included) incentivized to comment on rBitcoin and keep things going. Don't disrupt the gravy train.
And if you have to censor other peoples ideas because it goes against your own, then your ideas are probably bad.
You are making BitcoinTalk look bad. Stop it. Sit down and shut up or you will continue to make BitcoinTalk look like they want to censor their competitors. + there isn't any evidence people are paid for either.
Don't be naive.

Did you completely forget the biggest Bitcoin Forum owned by Theymos(he owns too) has Signature Campaigns on BitcoinTalk? I don't see anyone on spamming with a Signature Campaign making 2 or 3 USD per post.....Bitcoin Talk literally has paid Signature Campaigns and a lot of people post for payment there. You absolutely have to be kidding about being paid to post on I have not seen anything like that there.
You going to report Bitcoin Talk or something then? or Which obviously has a great carry over from Bitcoin Talk(where most people are in paid sig campaigns).
Your denseness astounds me.
