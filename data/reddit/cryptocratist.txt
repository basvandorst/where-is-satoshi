In any case it is mentioned in the article that for long term mining the key is lowering the cost of electricity or even get it for free. It is also states that " if you solve the electricity problem you can be profitable for any mining machine you got on your hands. " I think you really misunderstood the whole point of the article that mentions renewable energy which is used from big companies and therefore this should be the answer for individuals to participate in the security of Bitcoin network which I honestly believe leads to a more decentralized network than the current one(China farms).

In any case, richest man on the earth could have a change of mind, nobody knows. And Warren Buffett is a man of money, if he sees an opportunity in making more he might try it.

I agree that is has been tried already but not as organized as you may think. I believe that in the future we are going to experience a more organized way of propaganda and fear in a global scale.

I really don't know but I guess people who don't know about the industry and want to get money fast.

Not said, but done. Global political right wing is rising a lot these days. I don't expect you believe these guys are in favor of crypto and decentralization.

It's not a partnership. Their high-end devices will support Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Until now they only supported ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.

They can, not by attacking to the network itself but by propaganda and fear which they can spread.

I am also surprised on how the fuck he is able to run a Trading platform.

Don't misunderstand me, I feel what you are saying and totally agree with that.

We trust it because it verifies.

Hello iamtony, I can't agree more with you that guys like you and me use other ways to buy btc or other crypto. But that is not true for the majority of people who want to get involved right now as I am sure you know the technological education of Greece is low. These people may want to get involved in the crypto space but they want to do it with the push of a button. As for the fees yes they are crazy and it is not worth it to buy small amounts often but people I have talked to they don't really care for the fees. As for the recession part of Greece, as a Greek myself I totally agree with you on what you said of all these being BS. And again the majority wants easiness and they find all these ways people like us use to buy cryptos, too troublesome.

I Just wanted a more fair system so the votes cannot be tampered by anyone. That's all, and in any case I wasn't looking for money or bla bla... Only a solution to a problem. That's why I asked, so people with more knowledge can sent me the right way. If the idea was dumb is ok but I don't find a reason for people to be rude in any case.

It's like a voting blockchain to decentralize decisions made. Currency will exist but it will serve only the purpose of voting. Let's say governing.
You covered me enough. Thank you.

Why you are using his name on my post?? This is the worst thing that happened to me today. :(

 Okey, I watched the videos about blockchain and markets with supply and demand that the other guy posted. I knew about this already. What I thought is: we keep on thinking centralization always with a few participants but never with millions of participants. 
For example only the citizens of a specific country who will use the tokens for voting various subjects. Only if you are a citizen of that country you can earn this token and vote thus centralization. But in the big picture you have millions of users voting in a decentralized network. So that was my idea.
