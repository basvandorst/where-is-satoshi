Sorry, not taking this. It reflects on Bitpay and the bitcoin community at large. This is NOT ATTACKING, I'm shocked you say this.

Hello butter troll :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:39:04
FYI - He's the organizer of the Miami Bitcoin conference. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:34:24
Nah. He said these were "severe pain points" and I wanted to point out from someone who lives off bitcoin that these points are absolutely not painful.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:29:49
You do put it in perspective. At the end of the day Moe has done more good than bad, and yes Garza is absolutely the one needing attention now. :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:18:57
Stopped reading after he assumed that you can actually know who owns which bitcoins, or what %.

Thank you Bruce, I like where you are going with this.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:09:54
Thank you for that interview. It was epic when you pulled out that debit card, and said you can buy anything :) 
2015 will be interesting: Bitwage + Debit Card + billpay + trezor

A lot of crap coins out there, but Ripple doesn't have a cult, own news sites, btc.com, and a myriad of other shady shit. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:35:13
Not when they are a prime sponsor of an important Bitcoin networking conference! :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:39:09
Moe never said the money was refunded though.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:36:19
They calculated the market cap using the premine values... epic fail. It should be worth less than $4 Million if that even
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:56:08

I think this issue is big enough we need to post it on a 'proper' sub, like where most people will see it. At this point it looks like major censorship to me

Yup, more Bitcoin foundation crap. These guys are ridiculous

@_date: 2015-01-07 19:11:32
0% to do with bitcoin. 110% altcoin. It's an interesting concept, but has been pumped here multiple times.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:40:54
And that might be partially why Ripple has been EXTREMELY quiet lately, and their community small. 
They haven't done anything nearly as openly scammy as GAW though, you have to agree with that at least.
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:12:06
You guys do an amazing job, but posts like this are really important though, perhaps got caught in the moderation.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:33:58
Yes, I liked Brock, but this is too much. His motives are clear after watching this crap speach: 
This is the TIP OF THE ICEBERG folks. So many people are connected to Brock pierce, and obviously they won't say anything. 
Just look at GoCoin / Brock Pierce Crunchbase profile. 
Why is an altcoin funding a bitcoin conference... hello? Moe, did you google Paybase?
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:45:56
Ugh, no. I lost all respect for you. I'm starting to get depressed now. No one will speak up and do the right thing. You know things we don't, and you are PROTECTING people. It's obvious now.

I was only addressing "severe pain points" please read my post again, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:11:32
That is absolute BS. This is extremely important and relevant to the bitcoin world. What are you guys trying to hide?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:01:10
Very strange final statement. It would have been nice to hear why an Alt coin is a top sponsor of a Bitcoin conference. Not only that, but an alt-coin which publicly states it wants to replace bitcoin, an alt-coin which has been called out at least 3 or 4 times in news sites exposing their lies. 
Lesson: Money talks 
Having said that, the Decentral.tv (not Vancouver) video does show that these conferences are important networks / salons for deals, and partnerships, so a lot of good seems to happen. It's very clear that Moe has done a really great job putting them together, and they are quite a lot of work, especially being a part time job.
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:07:57

Dang, he put in a lot of effort doing these. This really puts it in perspective.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:36:32
See my other post: They calculated the market cap using the premine values... epic fail. It should be worth less than $4 Million if that even
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:55:57
This is definitely a possibility
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:43:40
So this could be an extra strategy for some miners to make profit? That sounds terribly irresponsible, but definitely seeing people doing this.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:56:15
It would be funny, but very sad, and depressing that they would allow it, also childish. Would look bad upon the whole affair.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:26:12
I'll delete this post so we can concentrate on Garza, but it was highly irresponsible of Moe, sorry. I was at the Chicago conference, and it was crap. His closing speech was an awkward few minute shenanigan, oh but he sure knew how to party after the conference, that's for sure. He was quite the hobnobber. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:43:35
Ugh that's bullshit. If Moe really loves this community he would stop this though. I'm not seeing any indication but a clever well worded wall of babble.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:10:25
Please look at the source: 
His full time job is working for Bitpay, which is a lot of work. His part time or side job is the conferences (also obviously a lot of work).
Please stay on topic, rather than trying to abuse me (is this a sock puppet account?). The major concern / issue is in the first paragraph of my post above.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:47:12

@_date: 2015-01-09 21:06:55
Tony handled it really well. He carefully parried the low ball comments about hacking/price, and put in 4 very smart points to address the price / bitcoin is dead crowd:
* 2 years ago the price was like $13, now it's almost $300
* 2 years ago there were barely any bitcoin companies, let alone venture backed, or at CES
* Venture capital had 4x infusion in 2014 vs. 2013
* Mt gox last year was 90%+ loss, bitstamp was like 1%, if even that (may have had insurance, vc help, etc)
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:03:08

To anyone who is downvoting this video, it looks like it was made new years eveish. It also goes really in depth into why these conferences are so important, which I wish Moe mentioned before. They are going to be in the inner circle at SXSW with their own house for Bitcoin. Some really cool stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-31 07:55:55
Not sure about the claim, but that's (47k/s txns) close to Visa's peak during the year. Definitely something Gavin mentioned could be possible in the future (

I'm simply addressing "severe pain points", please read my post again, thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-18 09:48:34
* I live on Bitcoin, so I'll do my best to answer this (Bitwage + BTC Debit Card + other stuff) and at least show that these points are not at all "severe pain":
* Here we go:
"still difficult to find everyday places to spend Bitcoin":
* Completely not an argument anymore. Just use a debit card connected to a dedicated BTC wallet. Top off the wallet. Spend anywhere! Gyft / egifter is another choice. Then there's brawker for example.
"still difficult, slow and error-prone versus modern systems like "tap to pay" with credit card (common in Europe / Canada)":
* I actually thought Bitcoin was far faster, and more efficient. Also Bitpay has one tap, and certainly others too. Braintree/Paypal is advertising this as well. Any company with tap to pay can integrate bitcoin rails... not a problem. Bitcoin is underneath tech... please don't confuse QR codes with being bitcoin. 
"Bitcoin value constantly shifting by the hour and day stresses consumers (myself included)":
* Never bothered me whatsoever. 
"mostly declining value for ~12 consecutive months (terrible for weekly / monthly use)":
* If you got into bitcoin without looking at it's volatile history... kinda obvious it's going to be a rocky ride. Never had a problem for weekly / monthly use. I always see it like digital gold... it fluctuates.
"no recourse if balance is lost to fraud (unlike credit card)":
* Not a problem whatsoever, but it could  be one. I've never once had a consumer problem (using plain BTC or BTC debit card purchases). People need to use a trusted escrow, or DEFINITELY trust the person shipping to you. This is probably the only argument of yours with some validity, but not for long. 
"currently almost zero incentives (rewards programs, etc) in most cases":
* The incentive was always inherent in knowing the pleasure of living outside the old antiquated banking system, US dollar / etc. It feels very free. sometimes the price shoots up, and shopping feels nice when you get 5-25% off :)
"little to no savings (even with small retailer discounts) due to exchange fees and spread when buying Bitcoin at market rate":
* This is going to change in the next 5 years. Basically, this is the absolute last thing I'm worried about when living a life solely consisting of Bitcoin. 
"most ATM fees are still extremely high (5-8%)":
* This would be a great argument if Bitcoin were mass adopted. It's so early on, this is simply not realistic right now. I don't have a problem paying those fees right now knowing this. Also BTC Debit card also eliminates most need of the ATM.
"high risk for accidental loss or misuse (just count the horror stories online)":
* Never once have I lost any BTC, ever. The horror stories are usually very very silly. For example, someone storing most of their networth in a safe. Or someone forgetting their wallet data in a phone before restoring, or someone forgetting their btc on a computer, with no backups. 
"risk of theft (ditto)":
* No way. Not anymore than losing your car, getting robbed, etc. Everything has a risk of theft. Soon, we'll be seeing BTC insurance, and every week the options of securing your btc gets better. Elliptic, Xapo, multi sig, etc... come on! :)
"risk of exchange freezes or shutdowns (ditto)":
* Absolutely no way... people should know by now to store a limited amount on exchanges, if at all. People who do put a lot on exchanges are likely traders and know the risk! There are numerous options now to store significant amount of your money in BTC securely. 
"little or no insurance backing BTC deposits on most exchanges":
* Nice try, but not really big nowadays. This would be a much bigger concern 1+ year ago. See my answer above... people should know this by now! Also, this is going to change for the better in the next 5 years.
"still difficult to buy Bitcoin, requiring substantial verification process online (and offline, in some ATMs)":
* Not at all whatsoever. I'm tired of hearing this. Creating a bank account took much more work than opening up a Coinbase or circle account with full verification. This is bunk, COMPLETE and UTTER bunk. Buying is easy. 
"most people new to Bitcoin seem have difficulty grasping the concepts":
* Absolutely completely 100% untrue. My parents understood bitcoin in about 1 minute. Instead of $200 it is 1BTC. Done. That's about all most people in the world need to know. The rest involves paradigm shifts. This argument is akin to .... well email will never take off because people have difficulty grasping the concept of email. Coinbase, Changetip, Bitpay, and many other companies have made BTC easy as pie.

Patrick: "well we have had sort of uh a loose alliance with counterparty. We... we're not... we're we're open to other people, in fact we are talking to other people. But we like counterparty, but like some other people too. We've uh, we've made some interesting investments. We're building some technology in the first half of this year. I believe we'll have some quite exciting announcements."

Nope, I'm just an average Joe actually who is excited to live outside of the old antiquated system. I'm addressing his statement "severe pain point"
None of his points are a "severe pain point", they are paradigm shifting things, or simply non issues. Akin to email adoption.
Why send an email when I can simply write a letter, and put it in my email box for the mail man to pick up? Who even has email!?

There's a very good reason: Let's say they pump it up 10x. There are too many traders that will dump at that price, bringing it back down to where it was. 
Solution: We need more demand. Demand will hold the price, and dampen whale dumps

Is this what Shift payments does? It's a debit card that connects to your coinbase account

This is fucking huge

What exactly is the truth about the murders in the trial (the hit jobs)? Was that actually him?

What the fuck? Are you serious? 
I was wondering why 2 Ripple Labs / Shitcoin people were there. That's just insane.

Is there any reference on the versioning format? I assume it will increment .1 until people are satisfied we hit v1.0?

Another price &gt; all else moron

When did this start, and how do you claim the stellar?

Bitcoin debit cards do that easily

The $8 campaign was atrocious, unprofessional, and naively done. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:34:57
How is that possible? 
Yes, they can't 'physically' take it from you, but they can easily use the $5 hammer method to take it from you by force.

My mind is fucking blown. Queue Rod Serling

I found it! Here is the link:

That was bizarre.

Is Mega holding their BTC?

You mean the guy on this page (next to Garza)?

I think there was a Ray Kurzweil video where he briefly touched on this.

Nothing will, it'll be a slow thing: Video game economies, porn, and micropayments (news / artists / digital content, tipping, etc) I see being big potential

Yup. This. A lot of people are turned away by this. Peter Todd for example seems extremely polite, kind, and soft spoken in video interviews, but his web persona seems the opposite.

Well... the "laugh at you" stage is over!

Isn't that an Invertible bloom filter?
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:28:11
I absolutely agree with that of course. Very true.

You should team up with that animation guy here on reddit, and do some videos on these topics :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:57:23
You're totally missing the point here :) Duh of course it's a service, but it's super scammy, and worm like behavior. $30 Billion? Also see the comment below about the class actions
