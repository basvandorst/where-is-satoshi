It's a real murky, ambiguous mess. That's for sure.

Worldwide, don't want to exclude anyone. We're paying for everything. We're not going to give something away and make someone pay to get it, so don't trip on that! -Rob
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:15:10
Thanks for the support! We're working on an update now to bring the entire timeline up-to-date. :)

They haven't explicitly said that, but by stating that Bitcoin is indeed NOT a currency, they will have to back pedal and issue new guidance or call Bitcoin what it is, a currency.
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:26:21
You guys rock for the upvotes! :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:24:46
Well, you got your chance there Nick. :)

They don't actually require palm scanning. Manufacturers are building them into the machines in order to be future-ready if compliance comes to that. You don't need to scan your palm with your ATM. 
Besides that though, the IRS spoke up and said that Bitcoin is not a currency and will be treated as property. 
Money Business Licenses are not required.

Just visit the page in the link above and you can enter there. We are using Rafflecopter for the contest.

Eloquently put, horribly true. Still, I think they put their foot in their mouth with this ruling. The ATMs are coming. :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:27:47
Well, it's not free for us. But if you win it don't cost you nothing.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:54:44
You bet! I am going to work on improving it, adding more dates, and setting up a contact form. I figure there are things I've missed and a collective approach will allow it to be more exhaustive and complete.
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:04:05
U MAD BRO? :)
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:26:02
Yep. Need to do some research. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 01:38:11
I'm not arguing that Bitcoin is the end-all solution. It has room to approve. What I am arguing is the main focus at this point should be mass acceptance. At least ONE currency has to be easily accepted by offline merchants. Until it reaches that point it's still just a niche currency used by enthusiasts, etc.
But what is to stop those other developments from being incorporated into updated versions? Isn't that how open-source projects work?
@_date: 2013-07-03 01:39:36
I didn't expect everyone to agree with me. This is reddit. = )
@_date: 2013-07-31 19:05:03
Can't believe I missed this the first time around. We offer anonymous hosting - no personal info to sign up when you pay with Bitcoin, Western Union, or MoneyGram. 
We can host Ruby on Rails.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:48:05
That's where I see it. Explaining Bitcoin to someone who is not really tech centered is a nightmare. 
When we can walk into 7-11 and pay with Bitcoin, then we can invest more time in other coins. The true competitor is fiat, and if cryptos are working on other versions/plugins/alts rather than ONE then resources are being spread thin, which would otherwise be spent improving one system that works exactly how we want it.

Hello I wanted to provide some information for you guys. My name's Rob. I'm with BitcoinWebHosting.net. I'm glad you've found a bit of an interest and I'd like to provide some clarification.
Let me answer this in the order they were asked:
*1) Where is the hardware geographically located?*
*Saint Joseph, Missouri
*Edmund, Oklahoma
*Worcestershire, UK
EDIT: We have more locations! Dedicated servers: USA - Frankfurt, Germany - Bucharest, Romania -London, UK.
VPS Locations (choose your location): New York, NY - Dallas, TX - London, UK - Dublin, Ireland
*2)Why is bitcoinwebhosting.net registered via GoDaddy?*
If you read this post ( you'll understand the background of the company. I registered the domain before the company was put on the table. It will be updated to reflect our registrars in the future.

I agree with you here. It would really depend on the number of players, but this could just be more of a by-product. The main thing would be a mixing service and exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-04 22:25:42
What I mean by that is this is not a case of "buying a dedicated server or vps". This is an off-shoot company geared exclusively towards a certain niche in a market that is under served. 
Look at our site: we offer dedicated servers.
Speculate however you wish. Be negative all you want. If you believe in the concept of Bitcoin and value your privacy, I would imagine that a warm welcome would be a better reaction. 
Without companies choosing to provide solutions geared towards Bitcoin, there is no Bitcoin. Market adoption means more businesses entering the arena allowing for more choices for consumers.
That is the only way widespread adoption occurs. Just sayin.

Who knows? Maybe someone makes it happen and we all start trading coins on The Sims lol
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:23:37
We will look into adding this functionality. The reason it was not added is it's easier to understand what you're paying when displayed in USD. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:27:49
Hmmm.. I'd say that paints it in a better picture. It just seems that if all of the developers worked on ONE alt-currency, any improvements would go to benefit ONE system. With all of the outside pressure, it seems we'd be best putting all the resources into one.
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:59:08
You can add us to the list. The only thing we need to get you going is an email (support, billing, etc) other than that you can call yourself whatever you want, or simply nothing at all.
In fact, we spelled it out pretty clearly in our [privacy policy]( At [BitcoinWebHosting.net]( your personal details are none of our business.
We offer **anonymous** web hosting. What's more, we actually are a performance driven web hosting provider. Whether you need a dedicated hosting solution, a VPS, or a simple shared hosting plan, we can accommodate your needs.
We're quietly opening our doors. We will soon be adding anonymous domain registration and DDoS protection/mitigation to the line up as well. Look for it in the coming days.
I'm excited to be a part of the Bitcoin community, and I am even more excited to offer a solution that is hard to find these days - truly anonymous hosting. 
We accept Bitcoin, Western Union, MoneyGram, and PayPal. Obviously, the payment method you choose has the greatest impact on your anonymity. Bitcoin is the best, followed by the rest. PayPal offers no anonymity. Keep that in mind when you order.
We look forward to serving you.

Not the case and not going to happen. I can assure you of that.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:35:00
Exactly my thoughts. It can't be treated as a system of pure rebelliousness, but a payment solution that provides benefits to users, to companies, and to the world. Bitcoin is the future in a world that is reducing human life to databases. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:31:12
Keep in mind I did not write this in response to the latest drop. I an not concerned in the least about that. I am approaching it as a whole.
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:49:25
Do people use these for easy exchanges?
@_date: 2013-07-24 00:38:58
Thus the mining pool aspect of it. In either case, this is not in my plans and started from a conversation on Google+. (I am not the originator). Just curious what others would think.
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:36:35
Thanks. Wanted to provide an option for the privacy minded, and the Bitcoin community. = )
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:51:27
Yea, I would imagine that if it caught on they would be shutdown or halted until they were licensed or regulated in some way.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:33:59
It's incredibly simple.
1) More payment options opens your business to more customers.
2) Accepting Bitcoin can be a great PR move, both for building links and actual news coverage (depending on your business).
3) Volatility doesn't matter. Use Bitpay and they will automatically transfer the funds into your bank.
4) Cheaper than a merchant account and PayPal. 
5) Funds are typically available in your bank account faster than a regular merchant account (using Bitpay).
6) No opportunity for fraud. A confirmed transaction means you are paid. There are no such thing as chargebacks.
Edit: Accepting Bitcoin through Bitpay also allows you to comfortably invest in Bitcoin by diverting a portion of your profits in Bitcoin. You can choose the percentage you would like sent to your bank and get the rest in Bitcoin. You can change the percentage at any time and if you'd like it all just sent to your bank you can do that as well.
Source: I own a business that accepts Bitcoin. And I've owned others that don't.
