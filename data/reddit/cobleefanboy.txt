It does give away gox might be more stable than not yes.  however roger ver is the CEO's mate, he can ring up and access his bitcoins anytime.  We cant.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:13:58
We arent currently in a free market though, silk road shut down, bit instant guy arrested.  
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:10:13
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:46:26
keep fighting the good fight guys, thank you for efforts!
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:09:51
Thats based on larger assumptions than i &amp; others would like - judging by how annoyed gox customers are.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:05:23
roger might not believe them but still gets his money due to connection?
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:55:51
i feel like if they have a chance to manipulate they take it, im worried if we dont speak up they will run this non BTC withdraw scam for months
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:00:20
What will this mean?
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:26:37
say hello to $200-$300 bitcoin if gox goes
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:33:47
yes but breaking the law currently since we arent in a free market
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:37:16
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:40:26
its true its clearly faked volume
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:00:44
what minute of the video ?
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:11:24
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:43:28
Seeing the financial info tells you the level of liquidity they have.  Its an advantage to know fractional vs total. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:59:42
Well i dont know, i reckon we should go after associates, nobody wants to be socially ostracized.  
So if anyone wants to help please do.  Dont be surprised if gox run this non BTC withdraw thing for months &amp; months.
@_date: 2014-02-21 11:45:03
you obviously dont have anything in gox
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:42:44
why would they tell us where they are though if they are on the run?
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:01:11
I dont care, i just want my bitcoins &amp; will be continuing attack of gox &amp; associates until they hit my wallet
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:38:44
Ok so the title should be roger ver potentially breaking the law via inside trading since we dont know the future.  
Right now gox arent give anyone anything BTC/fiat so what am i to assume? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:28:34
roger ver has seen bank account details as he stated in this video 
those account details are not publicly available, roger ver has unfair advantage  
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:15:08
what happens to people with money in gox?
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:17:29
   +1 loudspeaker
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:51:06
judging from his other videos thats how he speaks, its unusual i guess.
seems like a cool guy i dont know why hes hanging with gox
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:02:20
I agree the law is stupid thats not my argument.  You &amp; i might be breaking currency laws yes.
He is a higher profile so has to watch his actions more than a peasant like me. (thats normally how it works)  He is associating with gox so right now he might be able to help gox CEO do the "right" thing.  Gox arent communicating. 
I dont care about his profit, good for him, i just want my BTC :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:21:34
yes i agree its positive but it doesnt mean a certainty..... &amp; i would honestly assume roger ver doesnt have his own account on hold.  he just rings up his mate &amp; gets instant withdraw 
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:54:08
fucking funny
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:39:48
video needed
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:49:37
Im no expert on that either, i wouldnt know which category it fell into exactly. I think there is enough here to draw attention to associates of gox. 
I dont actually want to run a legal case &amp; think the law is stupid but hey fuck gox right now.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:22:26
inside trading is illegal, using bitcoin as a tool
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:18:06
Hey urlate nope im still waiting, i'm now @ what 3 or 4 days i forget..
are you withdrawing?
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:52:58
I did submit that withdraw nearly 2 days ago now though &amp; there are no reports of any other withdraw problems.  Im glad they keep things secure using this method but i gave it 24 hours for potential refill
@_date: 2013-10-30 09:23:41
i fully understand urlate and if BTC crashes now you have no control to sell out.  I was moving my coins to BTC-e to sell instantly.  I dont believe gox would have compensated me in the result of a crash despite their error.  You could try tweeting magical tux, i replied to his tweet last night 2 minutes after he tweeted linking him to here, maybe that did it.... i have no clue its a total gamble making a withdraw
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:55:07
i got this email saying 1-24 hours, i remained calm for 24 hours... 
Please be noted that when withdrawing or depositing bitcoins into your Mt.Gox account there may occasionally be a delay (1~24 hours) depending on network congestion
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:43:13
ok thanks so much for that both im on it now will report back with any luck :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:14:00
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:32:02
Withdrawing BTC to put on another trading exchange.  The coins were bought and in my account @ gox to clarify.
@_date: 2013-10-30 09:17:56
Dear Sir
Thank you for your patience. As you can see from ( your transaction as finally been confirmed by the blockchain.
We are very sorry that it took so long but please understand that Bitcoin transaction confirmations are not under our control.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team
 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:26:46
Thanks yeah it is a bit : / .  Also as you can see my account is verified and in good order, i've deposited since &amp; can trade right now.  Mostly i want insurance here... happy to give gox time if they are going to talk fair. Else i have no choice but to protect myself hopefully via sympathy from others.  
In a parallel universe BTC has already crashed to $10 and im $4k down with MtGox saying its not their fault.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:59:48
yup i hear ya just not feeling like going all in right now its a little high perhaps : /
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:45:30
Yeah its mostly crash concerns i guess, i feel i have to withdraw 1 or 2 btc @ a time for my remaining balance at this point if i want to cash out total
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:10:50
yeah i hope ASAP also :) i cant withdraw semi large amounts again without guarantee rate if the withdraw takes say more than 24 hours then, too risky with BTC price volatility.
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:02:53
RIP namecoin
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:28:19
well i emailed them asking and they didnt give it to me....
Thank you for the email. You will be updated by concern person regarding this.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team
 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:46:32
That is probably safest play yes i will have to reconsider investment strategy at this point : (
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:05:10
oh for god sake more of us :(
i have transaction ref in my email if thats it, have you done this? can i mess anything up? 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:46:04
Thank you for your email. We will have this escalated to our developer and we check if we can get you raw transaction information (with the signature). We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team
 
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:13:59
gox me once shame on gox, gox me twice shame on me
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:26:58
This is a concern, a very good post taking all into consideration i will be altering investments now.  Not to mention its stressful messing with BTC all the time, might aswell just buy &amp; hold, come back in one year :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:29:43
they just said someone will update me on the situation when i asked :(
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:42:59
Support sent me the link to try and prove it was in the blockchain : / maybe they got confused because there is one for 21.9 before it.  This withdraw is 19.9.
You think we should get insurance vs bitcoin crashes once they go past a certain time frame for withdraws? they told me 24 hours 
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:47:11
42 hours ago made BTC withdraw
24 ago after 3 emails going back &amp; forth MtGox admit its not in the blockchain, here is address im waiting on:
I've asked MtGox to guarantee my buy in price of $190 should BTC crash before they have solved their error.... they have avoided answering this exact request (emails are in this topic)  
They also say they cannot credit 19.9 BTC back to my account so im powerless.   
ty for listening
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:45:22
i do alot thank you its 50% of my life right now im very passionate about crypto currency success not just bitcoin.  I am not tech savvy at all i dont understand this side only understand the economical theory and wider social implications of crypto 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:13:49
We need more coins for competition, people get too hung up on bitcoin only.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:08:09
ok great!
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:25:23
Yeah the FBI might want it to do well now hehe.  I guess my idea was the gov shuts down some exchanges &amp; prices drops is a good time to buy, i agree its almost impossible to stop long term.
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:36:37
i think its automated is my guess... but their wallet runs out sometimes and they have to refill it and dont seem to process some of the transfers left over instantly?
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:22:24
All the previous ones came through fast &amp; i was very pleased &amp; happy to wait.  What got me panicking was  they started telling me its already in the blockchain, so ok fine right?   they avoid my question about insurance when its past the 24 hours deadline they gave me.   Ive supported gox in past
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:46:51
if they manage to get me this raw stuff, is there anyway i can mess anything up and lose my BTC? 
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:38:07
Yep im aware i must take some responsibility with who i do business with sure :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:36:52
As regards my request for them to insure at least my $190 buyin incase of price crash until they solve this issue i have this response:
Thank you for contacting us. 
We have forwarded your request to the concern department and you will be updated on this soon.
Best regards, Mt.Gox Team  
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:01:44
Currently i was thinking it was more +ev to speculate with BTC, buy some alt coins etc.  But i reckon now 50% long term &amp; 50% speculating might be wise.  BTC is looking good for $1k+ at some point right? i guess the gov is always a worry
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:12:00
I have heard things about dont do from a pool to exchange thats all.... and i been around the BTC-e trollbox for a while not heard probs of gox to btc-e
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:36:26
I had no idea this increased the risk exchange to exchange at all but thanks.  I was aware of the direct from pools issues.
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:39:27
I really do not understand what this broadcasting manually is - sounds cool though :)   You saying they can give me a code i paste it in that link and it will start the transaction? or it will show me if they have started the transaction? sorry confused... any links?
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:52:38
i have emailed btw.... why dont MtGox just do this for anyone who is waiting on BTC withdraws im confused
