Two years ago that was true, but not anymore.  It's mostly clickbait garbage now and they lost their good authors so their "original content" is pretty weak
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:55:59
But not bitcoin!   Right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:27:46
You actually believe this 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:47:18
Currency of the future
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:09
You're pretty far off, OP
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:21
This is good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:25:31
And yet nobody actually uses it as currency

Bankruptcy is the same as bankruptcy protection.  The company is unable to service its debts with its current assets.  Given the information, all of their bitcoins have been stolen...and they probably aren't coming back.

Filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection = Bankrupt.  Its just a longer, less nasty way of saying it.  While they are in Bankruptcy, they are protected from pending lawsuits...so you can't sue them while they are in bankruptcy.

Enthusiasm grows as the bubble continues to inflate
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:11:54
A bank with no FDIC insurance that is a choice target for criminals 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:01:10
What a dumbass
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:18:49
The ignorance in this thread about capital markets is astounding
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:07:12
Continued enthusiasm and disregard for risk helps the bubble inlfate
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:31:12
God, you guys are gullible

People are paying nearly $10,000 for a single unit of Internet money
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:14:27
Irrational exuberance 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:49:15
You mean to tell me that markets can be volatile and unpredictable?  Holy fucking shit
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:27:38
But bitcoin isn't even made out of cardboard

We appear to be in the "fear of missing out" stage that is characterized by euphoria and intense excitement
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:29:04
This thread reads like a yahoo finance penny stock message board 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:15:45
This is like penny stock investing

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:48:10

@_date: 2017-09-09 02:01:12
Dude...you could, you know...work?
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:06:31
Doing job stuff
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:04:29
What the fuck does this have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:18:23
You'll have fun...until it gets stolen, that is
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:32:12
I wonder how that's working out today
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:04:29
What the fuck does this have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:16:11
