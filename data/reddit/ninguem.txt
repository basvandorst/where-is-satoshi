Bitcoin is a piece of software. The software keeps track of a ledger of units (also called bitcoin) connected to a string of numbers called an address. The maximum number of bitcoins is an arbitrary choice made by the person who wrote the software.
@_date: 2016-08-25 07:15:40
The record is not sent to anyone.  The ledger is public, maintained by the network. If you want to see your balance, you read it off the ledger. Of course, the ledger grows. The whole thing was 20GB last time I looked. Users don't have to keep it though.

@_date: 2016-08-25 07:45:29
In the computers of the people who are maintaining the ledger, the so-called "miners" (who may or may not be users). They get rewarded with bitcoin for their effort through a lottery of sorts. All this information is well explained online at many places. I'll stop answering now.
@_date: 2016-08-25 07:04:47
The ledger keeps track of fractions of a bitcoin (up to 0.00000001), so you send half to the payee and the other half back to yourself as change. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:58:48
What? Another bitcoin business holding lots of other people's funds gets "hacked" and the funds disappear? Is that supposed to be news?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:09:18
You are correct. But there are many accounts with a balance in the thousands that have spend transactions. Also there has been lots of work done on hash function collision, so to say that brute force search is the only possibility is still not right.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:52:41


I don't know where people get this kind of idea. There is, for example, the Pollard rho algorithm (google it yourself) which reduces the time of finding the private key to the equivalent of brute forcing a 128-bit key, so take the square root of all your estimates. Plus, there is the possibility of the development of quantum computers which are very good at these kind of problems (elliptic curve discrete logs). Given the right monetary reward, the development of these will be accelerated. But, you are not completely wrong in which it is infeasible right now to find private keys. But one should not be complacent and there should be some thought put on making changes in the next ten or twenty years.

Cash the check is not the same as depositing it into your account. Cashing the check means giving you cash and the bank has no recourse if the check turns out to be fake or has no funds. By depositing the amount into your account, the bank is advancing you the amount and they will withdraw from your account if the check bounces.

What's wrong with selling a put order? Person X says that they promise to sell 10 bitcoins at $1000 each by Sept. 1st 2014 to the first person to give them $1000. X expects the price not to rise to $1000 and, if it does and X is paying attention, he can cover his position say when the price hits $900. A person Y who believes bitcoin will rise way above $1000 can buy this contract and lock a good price or not buy (and lose $1000) if the price doesn't rise. If X and Y know the risk involved and can trust that the other will abide by the contract, I don't see why anyone else should care. Here X is naked short selling bitcoins.

For the price to rise substantially, we will need something substantially new. If nothing changes it might go back to $100 as before China.
One possibility is mass adoption, e.g. in developing countries for remittances or currency control evasion. For that to happen, some major improvement in user experience needs to happen.
Another possibility is the realization of the "internet of money" thing. If one of Colored coins, Counterparty, Ethereum, Mastercoin, Open Transactions or Ripple actually happens, it could be big.

You are confusing RSA (that bitcoin does not use) with ECDSA (which bitcoin uses). The private key is just a number between 1 and the order of the curve and the public key is computed from that. It should be unique but in fact the bitcoin protocol accepts both compressed and uncompressed public keys. Now the address is a hash of the public key and so many private keys (2^96 ) give the same address.

Where is my free lunch?

Someone used an online account once associated with Nakamoto to post "I am not Dorian Nakamoto", during the Dorian fiasco. Whether it was the real Nakamoto, no one can tell.

Don't rock the boat, baby :-)

If only there was another company that made Unix-based, consumer friendly, popular computers, laptops and smartphones...

200, 300, 400, 420 (guys, WTF?). Also at 500, perhaps?

I don't expect they will ever launch this product. This is patent trolling. If someone else tries to come up with a similar product, they will sue.

There is an old one here:

They also have old movies and other stuff. It's really nice. I've used many times and have just donated.

OK. But who is Nick Szabo?

You can have it. You know the private key.

Thank you, my phone just went ka-ching!

Many thanks to user who solved my immediate problem. Still, others may have the same issue and can't rely on some random redditor's generosity. I guess the question still remains.
For the record. I looked around at a number of options. 
Exchanges require some form of money transfer and it's only worthwhile for serious amounts, plus some of them require a lot of personal info.
Buying in person with cash seems to require meeting someone some random place. Somewhat worrisome and certainly not worth it for small amounts.
I tried running mining software (MacMiner, which provides a pool) for a couple of days but it yielded nothing. I might have done something wrong. I know that mining is not worthwhile without special hardware (and perhaps even with). It was just an experiment.
I went to some website which supposedly pays in bitcoin for some basic tasks (like mechanical turk). I did "work" for 15mins but I have yet to be paid.

Sorry to hear about your troubles but you will just be ranting to an employee that is following procedures, which if he didn't, could hurt his career.

Don't particularly care. The minimum that would show up in the wallet or a bit more if it makes it easier.


Not willing to provide personal information.

I've got rid of all my computers over the years, but never the hard drives. I have a box full of hard drives and a few enclosures in case I want to access them. Unfortunately, I never got into mining bitcoin...
