1. The new release and adoption 
2. Ease of mining for btc and increased difficulty for bcc
Are there any more?
Also wonder what the timeframe will be for each of these
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:05:28
Well that’s practically impossible with the cost of these Mining equipment and cost of mining. It’s close to impossible to own personal miners

Sounds like a good plan now it’s the consensus and execution! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:59:54
Guess it comes back to consensus again? How is this change going to be broadcasted to the btc community and what about the much needed consensus how is btc going to achieve it? Do we know if all the btc developers and other key players are in agreement with the way forward ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:40:43
Well what are the factors that will restore normalcy to btc and what is the time frame in your opinion ?

This is how the hash rate looks now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:51:42
Are the developers going to take notice and act soon? Are there any ideas floating around on other options of reducing fees?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:47:43
Phew .... what are the chances they don’t attempt it again? That is sending thousands of 1 cent transactions at high transaction fee only to sabotage the system. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:54:13
Btw where do I see this sort of information.... transaction size,  fee etc?
