Countries prosper when governments prosper. It is not realistic to suggest that people should not pay taxes. That's how governments exist. I'm open to some legit way to pay my taxes. For now that means I'm super honest when I file. This wont work with most people though and the government knows it. Something has to occur and I'm pretty sure the government will figure something out.

I'm saying there needs to be some kind of regulation... some kind of way for Uncle Sam to get his cut. If not, there's a lot the government can do to restrict my access to fiat. I can't pay my mortgage with cryptocurrency right now. I have to cash out. My concern is, just because it's technically possible to lock out government regulation, doesn't mean it's good for the future. Maybe I'm wrong. We're going to need decades though to truly get an answer.

What are you going to do if say you want to cash out more than a million dollars? Do you think the bank is just going to say, sure... here you go? The wire will be flagged and you'll need to account for what you have and how you got it.

What nation has ever prospered when its government failed?

This is a simple problem for a quantum computer. Which is what scares me. Who is coming up with a solution for this inevitability?

Except people are starting to realize the utility of Bitcoin is ridiculous. The fees and transaction times?? During the dot com bust, all the useless companies that only had speculative value on the market, died. Same thing is happening in the cryptocurrency space.

Actually I was on the IOTA bandwagon first. I hated XRP because IOTA peeps were hating on it. Then I started researching. Changed my mind and bought into XRP for the first time at $0.70. The more I looked into it, the more I was into it. IOTA sounds great... but it's not really being used all that much right now. XRP is. And I made over $2000 over the past few days. I'll get some IOTA at some point... but I did myself a favor... sold my IOTA... bought XRP and I'm pretty happy about that decision.

Coinbase absolutely blows. Full of empty promises and crooked practices (ie routing transactions through the U.K. for an extra 1% fee... with no notification). I have found a much better process wiring money from my bank to Gemini. It costs $20... which is much better than Coinbase fees. The first wire took an hour (done during bank operating hours). The second one took 13 minutes. This is now the only way I buy. I have immediate access to tx out to Binance. 
I always avoided wires because I thought they would take a week. However that is not the case. 
Not sure how long a weekend wire would take.

Sucks that haters feel so inclined to let you know how stupid you are, that the post is removed and people honestly looking to learn from others' mistakes are unable to. Sometimes I hate reddit.

Because he and Buffet both donate huge sums of "charity" to Planned Parenthood... who do, by the way, trade baby parts, to include brain tissue for money. Interesting to me he finds this immoral akin to trading bitcoin.

Yes. In my early crypto days, when I was young and dumb, I bought BCH thinking it was BTC because Roger Ver is an unethical opportunistic dishonest money grubbing human who deserves the public persona he's created for himself. Yes, Bitcoin dot com does lead to a totally different useless shitcoin that offers nothing except Ver's BTC profits spent on forced adoption.

I had a problem once getting on coinmama because I was spelling it wrong. In my head, it was coinmamma or coinmomma and it was taking me to sites that looked like phishing sites... they weren't the coinmama website I had used in the past. I checked and sure enough, I was spelling it wrong. I truly hope this was not your mistake.

Is your mortgage an ARM? If so, I suppose I can entertain your reasoning. However, I'm in a fixed mortgage. If my bank runs short and fails, my understanding is they can sell the mortgage but not change the terms. Maybe I'm missing something?

Hmm. No I haven't seen that article until just now. Not sure about the source but I don't pretend to know the economics of heaven... although as a human... my eternal dwelling place is not heaven. It's new earth. We'll have to see.

According to Revelation, God will shorten the time of wrath for the sake of human kind. We will all but destroy ourselves before God will intervene... with the return of Christ and the separation of those who love God and those who love the God of their own making.

Not even mildly.

This is a terribly interesting question... and one that boils down to your world view. I'm Christian and believe within the next 1000 years, we'll have experienced the return of the messiah and a preceding 1000 years of peace. None of the options are appropriate for that outcome. So... I'll take any two that you choose. I don't see myself as needing any of them.

Yea... I'm totally addicted to crypto. But I'm also a man of faith... I'm more addicted to my faith. I love it that you checked up on me though. I'm not 100% sure I'll be able to enjoy my crypto investment... check out Revelation 12 and the September 23rd constellation event. Something's up. Either way, I'm good.

I've given this a lot of thought. What will we do in the next age. I think I read something in the book of Enoch about God allowing humans and angels to hook up. Might be time to read that again as I just barely remember that being mentioned. God is in the life creation business and I really don't think He's going to stop once Christ returns. Maybe we'll spend that time exploring and colonizing different planets. I don't know. But you are right... we were created with an insatiable appetite for new things. I believe since we were created by God this way, his role is to constantly provide new things.

Your talking a period of years. I think most choose 30 year fixed. 30 years is long time for a market to be disrupted. I agree with you that the bottom falling out of the current financial infrastructure looks bad... but that's just for how things are right now. People will figure out how to lend. They've been doing it for 2000 years. People will always need homes. Other people will figure out how to do that and make money. I'm not worried. In fact I'm watching the banks squirm with great delight.

Indeed, I am a true believer. Jesus didn't come to condemn, but to turn brother against sister, mother against son, etc. Most will not accept what Jesus says. The wise will. Yes, I believe and I hope to convince anyone else who will listen. Eternity is at stake. Your eternity (which extends beyond your life here on earth) matters so much. So I'm okay with you dismissing me. Just as long as you know what I believe, and that I'm open to any and all communication. God is real. You're belief in Him or disbelief doesn't change the truth. Meantime, I'll peruse what I think it right and honorable... which happens to be my faith. But what an interesting question that started all this, yes?  
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:11:33
Yea, because it's so exciting now. School shootings... political upheaval... constant threat of nuclear war. It would be so boring with out all that.

Compared to what? I do not agree. These are parlous times.
