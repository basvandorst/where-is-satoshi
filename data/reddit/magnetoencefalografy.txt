I've been to a few zoos and I've never been so close to an elephant that it appears bigger than my kettle at a normal distance. She doesn't strike me as someone who goes on safari.

I'm making generalisations here. I'd still say you're in the minority.
Where did you ride it? Was it good?

I completely forgot about circuses.
^((The only time I've been was in Northern Ireland and it was terrible.)^)

Well she was still wrong; I doubt she's ever been close enough to an elephant for it to appear bigger than a kettle.

I think it's about right if they're spheres. Radius of a sphere with a volume of 1.5 would be 0.71, and the radius of a sphere with volume 83.6 would be 2.71. Those two look about 4x difference, but I'm too lazy to check the rest.
edit: smallest one would be radius 0.22, so it all seems about right.

Here's my negative opinion on bisq:
As a noob I had *all* of my bitcoin on bitsquare (tiny amount!), ready to purchase more, but GBP offers were few and far between, and single users making multiple different offers looked very suspicious to me, so I never tried it out. On top of that, the interface isn't particularly friendly next to standard exchanges.
Then they changed to bisq with no notification in bitsquare that I was aware off, and incompatible wallets. So fees there to keep my BTC in the "same" system.
Then they flat out refused to support the BCH hardfork in any way, effectively denying users free money. So I had to fuck around transferring my BTC out at short notice with ridiculous fees, because I'm a noob.
I exchanged that small amount of BCH straight into VTC... So bisq were actively harming the crypto ecosystem IMO.
P2P is absolutely the future, but bisq have completely lost this noob's support.

So he's stealing from the fanboys x -9? Where does the extra x1 go?
