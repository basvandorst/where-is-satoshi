Same, I wish I could buy more.

How many dips can you buy?

Why not get a wallet on your phone?
1. You always have it on you
2. It's secure
3. You have backup keys
4. You can quickly and easily buy n sell

If you are patient it will

I can't sign up for pro,
It keeps rejecting me for some reason, just says failed over and over
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:49:21
I use samurai, well started anyway and I'm happy with it
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:01:08
I will try to sign up to the pro again, it keeps failing to verify me
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:52:00
It tells me to send a picture of a utility bill to go pro

You have to pay capital gains or DIRT 
It's like 40%

@_date: 2019-07-16 18:15:50
How long can you hodl for?

Is samurai wallet a good option?
I don't want to fork out for a hardware wallet yet and most of my coins are on coinbase.
I'm a bit confused on where to get my key and how do I actually know that I have coins there instead of "seeing" a balance
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:21:28
Wow, I'm just a newbie so, I started in 2017 before November and almost panic sold, I'm glad I didn't. Instead of that I started researching it more and more and now I can't imagine a day where I don't listen to podcast or read article. 
I don't get when people who bought stuff with bitcoin and now say that they bought a laptop for 20000$...no, you bought for what it was at that time
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:48:26
I used it and still use it without complains,
It's simple, seems secure and devs care about security and privacy so it's a plus for me
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:06:53
Interesting, that may take some time to pick up but it looks like sun is shining on bitcoin in the future
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:54:04
Sorry, didn't realize it was bitwage that you're using. 
Just send them a copy of your electricity bill or something that you get regularly
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:20:59
Preev.com I have a tab opened do I can see without going to the site itself
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:51:30
One bill that will prove your address. Is there any other way you can get crypto? I wouldn't give my personal details
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:33:51
Instead of going for drinks or smoking I buy so I don't care
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:59:33
Fear for some is a great chance to buy the dip
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:38:50
Hot wallets? 
Keep it on your phone, 
Samurai is pretty good

I listen to tmi at work just because he tends to read through articles that I don't have time to read at work
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:47
I have a bit in coinbase but this starts to annoy me now, is there something more reliable than them?
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:03:46
I've done something similar as well in my free time, 
But with excel I also have a bar chart for each purchase to see %gain/loss on it. 
It's still a work in progress and probably always will be as I always think of adding in new stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:00:48
. To follow up on later
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:16
And will happen a million times again
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:11:51
Probably hype, lot of people who never heard of bitcoin hear about the huge increases and want to buy in, they buy at high so prices go up, they see that it goes down so they sell because they don't want to lose money. 
This causes price to go down, it's a simple supply and demand thing at a glance but I'm sure others can provide more insightful info
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:46:55
Coinbase seems to be down for me
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:03:09
Me too haha
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:19:22
So how do I get out of it?
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:04:46
I haven't bought in a while or looked at prices, saw it was at 6k so bought straight away
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:45:24
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
