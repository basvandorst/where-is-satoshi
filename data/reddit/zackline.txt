And he is damn right about it, in it's current state BTC is useless. Maybe LN will save the day, but currently it's faster and cheaper for me to send my private key in a letter than doing a Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:49:29
That's true, but that is what appealed to me. If you're looking for a speculative decentralized asset instead, I guess it's fine.

I asked for proof of that argument against a bigger block size, not kittens on ETH.
It's quite stupid to not consent to an update of BTC clients that would allow 4x+ more concurrent transactions, cutting the fees and transaction times massively. Even if it "only" postpones the problem for a year, that's one year of BTC being usable without ridiculous fees and slow confirmation times, and that for a small effort - it does not seem difficult at all to just increase the blocksize.
And no, I don't see how a backlog of transactions would build "immediately" when we quadruple the transaction throughput.   
The only downside I see is people needing to update their clients. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me. I suspect miners profiting from higher fees is a more realistic explanation for why we can't achieve a consensus on this.

I bought in at 500€.. but only with about 12€. :s
Sold half for 50€ at about 4000€, now the rest of it for 120€. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:09:24
Fair points, so you are saying that LTC and ETHs lower transaction time is not scalable for more concurrent transactions? Or what exactly does scaling the blocksize imply?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:11:03
Yeah, seems like any plans to use BTC as an actual currency are blown off. Lambo hodlers ftw.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:11:53
That's hardly an argument when you assume LN will take at least a year. The backlog of transactions is growing day by day. 
Just what speaks against an arguably easy patch to increase the block size so we can get by until LN releases? 
Tbh I suspect that it's big miners that block this in order to take more fees.

Invest in $rope
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:00:07
I honestly don't think the people behind BTC/miners even intent to fix it, else they would have just increased block size until a more permanent solution is ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:38:08
Nah. Even if the seller is interested in accepting Bitcoin at all and the size of the transaction warrants ignoring the fees, there is still the issue that you need to acquire the Bitcoin before the purchase, adding an additional delay that could mean significant course changes and you end up with either too little or too much Bitcoin in your account. If you just hold Bitcoin instead, you're speculating, and arguably that's not what many want to do. 
It's not nearly as feasible to buy things with Bitcoin as many here suggest.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:16:51
I sold the rest of my meagerly BTC I bought for 12€ at 500€ for 120€ today. 
When I read stuff like that guy replying to you saying "you have no clue", I won't feel bad for him when he loses his entire investment. People thinking they can get rich for doing nothing while also believing it's somehow safe, ridiculous - zero empathy from me. 
Just because BTC is the most widespread and known currency, imo does not really warrant it being worth 20x more than at the moment clearly technically superior other cryptocurrencies. Might still grow in worth, but not considering that a bubble seems delusional.

I pay 30% in Europe, and that's on a 2.400€ salary. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:47
No, you didn't. You gave me an example about a loosely related cryptocurrency apparently suffers under the load of some game. Calling that proof of scalability problems for BCH seems like a quite far stretch. It's just another entry in the list of ominous claims that I cannot verify. 
Yeah, so the problem is just distribution of the update, as I was saying. If we don't have the ability to adapt this 300 billion system with an arguably quite simple patch which's one downside seems to be distributing the update, that's pretty sad. 
That doesn't change the fact that the current rate is too slow. They even changed the project's translation strings in Github to reflect the sad state BTC is in: 
All mentions of instant or zero fees are gone because, in reality, the fees have become abhorrent and disable small transactions altogether. 
I'm not saying close to zero fees are a necessity, but cutting them to 0.5$ instead of 5$ would certainly help and be an improvement everyone should be able to agree upon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:03:41
The part where BCH, the coin that with 34% is down double than BTC at 17% currently is to blame for nearly all major cryptos correcting.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:48:10
Yeah, that's true. However, other coins seem to be able to test and release actually complex new features in a timely manner, so I'd hope that we could at least get together a simple patch.
Namely? I can see nothing else than increased cost for full nodes and less fees for the miners.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:57:23
Or increase block size until LN is ready, but apparently, that's too much to ask. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:08:46
I read that argument a few times now. Any proof behind that? As far as I understand, we have a damn lot of miners. Which still does not allow more transactions, because the block time and size is fixed. 
So by increasing block size, the number of transactions we can process increases accordingly. So I really fail to see how increasing the block size would "also have the same problems". From my understanding, Segwit is trying to do the same on a smaller scale but hardly gains acceptance.
I don't understand why BTC does not move to a bigger block size. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:43:25
If eg. ETH with 64B market cap is a playground, then BTC with is a mini amusement park at best.
I agree that Segwit is a step in the right direction, but even that reportedly puts a lot of additional load on full nodes, someone quoted 30-50%.
Perhaps there needs to be some incentive for full nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:40:58
I read up on it, seems to be a nice way to increase the block size without a hard fork. But even that doesn't gain traction apparently.

I've seen a screenshot where a mod wrote "pathetic altcoin shilling" in the ban reason, like a real child.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:53:25
I'll admit I don't know much about the technology behind the cryptocurrencies, but from my understanding, ETH is technically better due to it's faster block time and Turing complete smart contract instructions, where BTC has a very limited instruction set, so it's just used for transactions. 
Even when just comparing use as a currency instead of use for DApps, BTC is the slowest from my understanding. Both ETH and LTC enable faster transactions for lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:20:27
When I first downloaded mining software, magazines would run a lot of Bitcoin stories and Bitcoin was at 15€. I thought  "why would this be worth more than 1€". 
I was so wrong.
However, I'm not delusional to think this is any indication that this still applies, I'd bet that there will be a crash, no offense. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:23:50
RemindMe! 2 years "Bitcoin will be near worthless"
Let's see what holds up, I'd bet the same on 100k and nothing, but 4M? Nah.
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:12:22
Honestly, so many dumbasses around it's incredible. Only other top level comment in this thread someone thinks within a year a "sizeable" proportion of the population could be paid in BTC. 
Sorry what?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:16:59
So, you believed that with a market cap of over a 100 billion dollars, the value would still reach 100k? Who exactly do people that believe this crap think will pay those 400 missing billions? 
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:35:52
It seems to me like half believe it's somehow a free money machine. The only way Bitcoin is going up is when large parts of the population are interested in buying Bitcoin and exchanging their $ for your Bitcoin. I doubt this will happen during a crisis, where should the people get this money from?
