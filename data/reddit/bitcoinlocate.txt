by the way.. i dont think he wrote the initial paper.. i think some wrote or re-wrote it for him
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:21:09
hi Milliez.. i think its pretty obvious which crew he is from or which crew it is .. the anon, crypto, bitcoin crew in tokyo. some germans some brits.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:24:51

@_date: 2013-03-23 00:02:16
satoshin is a german service provider only available in germany... so we are getting a bit closer i think...
the japanese is maybe only a decoy... because english is easy to know and some brits living in tokyo okay.. but german mostly only germans know especially using gmx
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:32:56
good idea.. he probably has a significant bitcoin trail and he probably is on every major bitcoin service active
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:48:04
you sir are a major idiot. buying bitcoin and being emotionally attached to its price is like being a daytrader ... you sir have become a slave of your own mind... :-D my advice is to start living in your present consciousness and not in your emotions... you will see how ridiculously distanced you have become from your true self

how do people send you BTC? i cannot find your BTC address.
i want to add you to 
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:23:37
lol.. maybe you should google him more... he knows more :-D

Flavio D. Garcia, Jaap-Henk Hoepman research paper 2005
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:57:37
another update.. his GMT was set to +1 probably.
so that would set him in germany, switzerland etc. i am checking to confirm
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:48:49
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:54:21
plus everywhere on the web and in the source code he uses "generates" instead of "compiles"
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:13:45
knowledge about economics, mathematics, informatics phd and located in karlsruhe which would put him in the GMT +1 time
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:18:44
time is the essential factor... what went on right after and a year before the release... 
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:29:25
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:34:13
first result.. he obviously seems to be american or english. i take it more american from the comments in the source code
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:04:16
thank you :-D

lol... i am pretty good at digging for information and cross-analyzing info subconsciously. i often find patterns.. so i will figure it out on my own :-D its a riddle for me
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:30:58
i used to be a daytrader so i wanted to help you wake up... you must be completely detached from your mind in order to be happy... :-D seriously.
i love watching "Mooji" on youtube he explains it. i really dont care at all where bitcoins are at.. i receive $15 in 2011 which are now like $500 or so... if it drops to 0 i really dont care... but i want bitcoin to be a success :-D

lets start here lol 
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:06:49
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:09:04
i am close to finding out who he is ... they are brits living in tokyo.. i have the whole crew already
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:41:38
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:09:58
well there is one thing that is obvious... its a child of theirs and i am sure they are not going to leave it alone. so they will be evangelist of some form :-D
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:22:49
additionally, i must add i lived some time in Karlsruhe.. its basically known for its informatics technical university
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:09:28
no its sakamuru. it points to a german..
sakamuru has enough connections that he was working with a couple of science community friends on it and then they decided to make him front for what would be better PR.
