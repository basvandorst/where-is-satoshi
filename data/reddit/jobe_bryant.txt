The full quote from Bill Gates is the following:
"I think it's a techno tour de force, but that's an area where governments are gonna maintain a dominant role."

No, but he was in a position of responsibility to investigate and alert others to the truth of the matter.
You don't just go lending your name willy-nilly to companies to state that you are in an [advisory position]( and expect to get off scot-free when said company incriminates itself and goes bankrupt.
Antonopoulos no doubt realized this, as demonstrated by his lengthy and carefully considered attempt to excuse himself from the matter.


He is accused of ordering six executions. I don't think these claims would simply be made up, unlike most of the people here determined to believe otherwise (as with how Danny Brewster's innocence was maintained until the very end, remember that?). Plus there's more than that, but I can't recall exactly what the other things were since it's been a while since I've read up on it.
So yes, he's scum.

I'll just point it out:
The Winklevoss twins invested $1.5 million in BitInstant in 2013.

There would be too many to go through
Trust me, there's some things I could say about others like Bruce Fenton or even Andreas Antonopoulos (remember his role in Neo&amp;Bee?). Then you've got the real criminal scum like Ross Ulbricht, but there's just too many to list and go through.
Unfortunate you should mention Branson; I watched a video of him recently where he's mocking Bitcoiners for giving him money and promotion even though he's not actually going to keep the Bitcoin. He was literally laughing about it to the interviewer. Edit: [Found the interview]( - pay close attention to his response.
Can the others you mention even hold a candle to people like Robert Shiller or Warren Buffett? I mean, the Winklevoss Twins.. seriously?

That's interesting, I hadn't known of this before
