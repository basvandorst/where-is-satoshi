That's not what is talking about, the problem is figuring if the address has been spent: for that you need to scan the rest of the blockchain to see that it wasn't mentioned as an input in some other transaction (and continue scanning if it's also mentioned as an output).

Where is the value stored? As in, when you invest $500 into bitcoin, where do they go, physically?
Also, the part of the value you put into the system that went to the miners, what happens to it when you want to take it back with interest?

Yeah, but in _that case_ it doesn't matter if you have a lot of btc because you're an early adopter, or because you bought them from someone for $20M. Your price basis doesn't matter as far as gaming the market goes, right? Because you're supposed to get profit from each swing, getting more and more BTC, right? "Gaming the market" means that your wealth increases, wouldn't you agree?
Except it's really hard to do if each next upswing is significantly below the point where you forced the previous downswing. And if there are enough people on the market who short the hell out of you.

And in this case "doing something stupid" == investing in bitcoin, apparently. Because the game is rigged in favour of the manbearwhale, whether it's a rich person manipulating the market (I'm _really_ doubtful about that), or an early adopter getting all your money.

Are you sure you did it correctly? Like, have you checked your SHA256 computation to produce the same result as the computer (because I don't see that in your write-up)?
I'm asking because I DID THE MATH in an question, about the viability of manual public key cryptography, and there I arrived to a pretty ridiculous figure, like several decades for verifying a signature.

Problem is, nodes don't propagate invalid transactions. So if the node of the seller has saturated its immediate neighbourhood with the seller's transaction, but you managed to sneak a double-spend transaction to some huge mining pool, that transaction would not be seen by the seller. Nobody would forward it to them. Until the 1-confirmation transaction arrives, that is, but that's anywhere up to 40 minutes after the purchase.

No, valuation is in my head, value is supposed to be in the real world. After all, you can't "store value in bitcoin" if it's in your head.
I'm no economist, so I think about this stuff using simple, concrete examples. Suppose someone decided to start a bakery. Say, he needs $10,000 for that. So he finds ten people who agree to by a share for $1000 each. Then he spends that $10000 on ovens and stuff. Then the bakery starts producing donuts and bringing in profit, which is split between shareholders.
So I, as a shareholder, own 1/10th of the bakery (which would give me back less than my $1000 in case it goes bankrupt and gets liquidated, of course) but I also get, say, $200/year in dividends, which is pretty neat. So neat in fact some other person might consider the risks and projected revenues and offer me $2000 for my share. That would mean that he thinks that the initial value of the share was undervalued, and the true value is $2000 -- considering the $200/year it brings and his belief that he would be able to sell it for $2000 too.
In fact he might even believe that at some point in the future the bakery would make $400 per share, so then the share would be valuated at $4000, and offer to buy it for $3000 even, expecting to make more from selling it for $4000 than from the dividends.
But notice how so far there's no "it's worth what you think it worth" stuff at all. If the bakery would be producing $400/year in profit per share, then the value of a share would be $4000, for real. The valuation does change as risks change and awareness change, but the idea is that in the endgame it converges on the real value. Also, when I buy a share, I buy something real, the 1/10th of the bakery equipment and its production capacity. That's where my $1000 went.
With bitcoin, where does the ROI come from for the holders of bitcoin, and what is the end-game equilibrium based on the ROI?
As I understand, the only value bitcoin as a system actually produces is transaction fees from people using it instead of credit cards (both direct fees that go to miners, and indirect that go to speculators). First of all it's unclear how anyone who is not a speculator can extract value from bitcoins they own (and why that wouldn't destroy the market if the fees turn out to be too high), second, I don't know, CC business is not _that_ lucrative, I think?
I mean, so far it looks like a classic pyramid scheme. When you buy a bitcoin for $500, part of that money goes to miners (who mine at the rate of 3600 btc per day, by the way, it's kinda scary) and then to electricity and hardware companies, part of it goes to the pocket of someone who bought at $250 ($250 as his profit, $250 as the profit for the rest of the chain of the people who he bought that bitcoin from). Either way your $500 is gone, it's not stored "in the bitcoin" anywhere.
What you get in return is the right to sell your bitcoin to someone who is willing to buy it for $1000. And he would hope to sell it to someone who will buy it for $2000. But the logic of the pyramid breaks when the price growth stops, say at $2000, because nobody will want to buy it for $2000. Because then there'd be no possibility to make a profit. Putting your money under your pillow is better because there's no transaction fees. Investing your money into a bakery is incomparably better. And what happens then?


Well, I guess if most people buying it think like that, it explains why it has not crashed much earlier.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:47:24


Inputs you already know, but anyway, how do you think the network finds the last spend from that address without scanning the entire blockchain starting from the transaction where it was given value to?


I don't know if they can verify that the coin has not been spent actually. Are you sure they can?
Maybe mining nodes do allow anybody to force them to scan the entire blockchain (they have to do that when verifying a transaction anyway) but can get upset if you try to spam them with a shitton of request.
Point is, while this is certainly doable, it's not exactly straightforward (compared to querying by transaction id) and a person like Karpeles could very well decide not to bother.
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:13:15
That's actually is not really important, because the difficulty of hashing a block is pretty much independent from the number of transactions in it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:59:05
This only works if the rest of the people on the market are completely clueless traders (not saying they aren't, mind you!)
Otherwise, the price is $400, you sell a bunch driving it to $395, at an average of $397.5, giving a shitton of USD to the traders who know that the real price is 400.
Then you're, like, can I buy your btc for $395? And they are, yeah, $395.5. That's the price. And you're at a fucking loss if you actually try to buy all your btc back all the way up. And at a total loss if you don't.
This is how it's supposed to happen in a mature market, populated with people who know what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:42:07

I think that what we need to do is to only allow selling bitcoin to people who have proven their dedication to Libertarian ideals: that they would never put their self-interest above the well-being of a Libertarian society (or currency in this case).

You accidentally a word, but yes, when you take money from your pocket and give it to the miners, then the miners give it to the electricity providers and it's gone, that's fits the definition of "costing".


Of course, but good luck trying to fight the Invisible Hand of the Free Market that pushes the miners to increase the scale of mining until close to the 100% of the 3600 btc mined daily are converted to fiat to pay for electricity. That's $1.5M daily at $400, by the way.

Why are you angry at me? You can explain to me what the difference is using words. You can tell me that my numbers for Bitcoin are way off, or explain what are some factors I'm missing, or whatever else the difference is. It's not some religious thing where either you have faith or you don't, the difference, if it exists, must be perfectly explainable to anyone.

The problem is that the biggest miners of bitcoin are currently in it for money, and they have no choice, really. 
Someone mining on their old PC because they believe in the idea doesn't have _anything_ on someone who invested millions of dollars into a datacenter full of ASICs, as far as the fraction of actually mined bitcoin goes.
And the person who invested millions of dollars into that can't afford to hold to them, to make a "good faith effort", they have to get their investment back, pay for the electricity and service, etc.
See [this guy]( Google for "(cloud or hosted) bitcoin mining", there are more companies like that.
I don't know how it would look like in an imaginary distant future where bitcoin has replaced USD, I see how it looks like right now and it doesn't look promising about getting from here to there.
Because that leak is real, and the self-adjusting difficulty doesn't change anything, really. As the price of the bitcoin drops it only means that the larger fraction of freshly-invested dollars is funnelled to the miners and then to the electricity and hardware companies -- how else could it be? As a soviet joke goes, "Daddy, daddy, vodka increased in price again, does it mean that you'll drink less? -- No, son, that means that you'll eat less".

Where does the phone come into the picture, that's what I don't understand.
For it to come into the picture with them having it "registered" in that geographic location, the organisation in question should actually send a verification SMS to that phone and be able to see that it's located where it's supposed to be.
And here having a socks5 proxy just doesn't make any sense. Mobile network has nothing to do with the internet. It doesn't work through the internet. You can't use a "socks5 proxy" to receive an SMS as if from some location.
 It makes as much sense as being able to print fake train tickets to be able to go to the movies for free. That is, none. These things are not related.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:47:27


These things don't make things more complicated, they are what determines the actual value.


Forex makes money from arbitration, as far as I understand.


Then investment into anyone doing that would give you negative interest. Like an investment into someone's gambling habit.
It doesn't, people actually make profit from this stuff.
But, of course, you can treat investment in bitcoin as pure gambling. Why not. I just don't quite get why you are giving anyone any advice like in the OP, and even try to back it up with some reasoning. You don't go to a casino and telling people to bet on black because reasons?
Also, you didn't answer, what happens when the cost of bitcoin reaches the point where not enough people believe that it can go higher? You said you would sell at $2500, OK, some dude bought at $2400 hoping to sell at $3000 (from some other dude who wanted to sell at $2400, obviously), but after a month of the price staying at $2400 decided that he'd rather pull out and use his money to play on forex. What happens next? Where does he get his $2400, what happens to the price and your investment?


The problem with bitcoin creation is that, as far as I understand, miners operate much closer to efficiency margins these days, so they actually have to pull a significant part of those 1.8 millions per day from the system (and give it to electricity and hardware manufacturers). So the true believers have to "invest" the same amount daily or the price will continue to drop and that money is really truly gone from the system, it's no longer a zero-sum game where you can have a stagnation/recovery period after a bust where everyone trades a little and invests a little.

But that's not how trading works, dude.
If you bought in at $20, then proceeded to "game the market" losing btc every time, sure, you'll be in the black until you lost most of your bitcoins.
But why would it drive the price down, if your strategy ends up losing you bitcoin, basically giving them to everyone?
I was talking about the "market manipulation" manbearwhale ending up in the black on every cycle, comparing to the beginning of the cycle, not comparing to their price basis. And that is hard to do if the price is falling between each cycle.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:38:23
Yeah, I know, it's the part where that is supposed to be used to access the mobile network (which is entirely separate from the Internet) that triggered all my whats.

The idea is that when the currency is moving it's because some goods were sold or services rendered in the opposite direction, which corresponded to the creation of some wealth -- someone literally baked some bread or fixed someone's car.
Then part of that wealth can go to the institutions managing the bookkeeping and to the speculators (all indirectly, of course).
No wealth is created when people send currency to themselves nor when they speculate with it.
It looks like very little wealth is created with help of bitcoin currently, therefore there's even less legitimate profit that speculators (long or short term) and miners can make.
So the profit they do make must come almost purely from more people investing more money into bitcoin. Note that this money is not "inside bitcoin" anywhere, it's not like when you invested into a business and they bought some machinery, this money literally went to some speculator or miner and it's gone, spent on hookers and/or electricity.
This can cause some problems when the investors who lined the pockets of the previous round of investors try to get their money back (even at loss) and there's no more new investors willing to pay them.

Wait, you're now conflating two completely different processes.
1. Someone with a lot of money is gaming the market, using their leverage to force market movements, then profiting from the lower and higher points that go far beyond their own involvement because bitcoin traders are dumber than fish in a barrel.
2. Someone with a lot of early-acquired bitcoin is gradually selling them, accidentally or purposefully (to obscure what's going on) causing fluctuations.
In the first case, stupid traders will go bankrupt, the remaining traders would become familiar with the game to the point of actually extracting money from every such forced movement.
In the second case, nobody's "gaming" the market, it's just witnessing the end-game of the P2P ponzi scheme. Like everyone hodling right now hoped it would happen when btc reaches $50k or whatever, then _they_ would sell while those future users would wonder where their money are going to, but no, it's happening now.

No, what you originally said was that they are selling a lot, then buying a lot. Then selling a lot, then buying a lot. Ending up with profit every time. That's market manipulation.
If they are only selling, that's a completely different beast.

Currently there's 3600 btc mined per day (25 reward \* 6 blocks per hour \* 24 hours). At $500 it's 1.8 million dollars per day going to the miners.
Unlike it was after the previous boom-bust cycles, first, the price and therefore the amount going to them is much higher, second, the mining market is quite developed now, before it was mostly enthusiasts who used a GPU they already owned, let their parents pay for electricity and hoarded their mined bitcoin. Now there's a developed market for mining with a lot of parties selling GH/s, so people mine closer to the marginal efficiency and therefore have to actually cash out a large fraction of those 1.8 million USD daily to pay for electricity and hardware. And that money are completely and utterly gone from the bitcoin trade.
Your $11,000 wouldn't make a dent in that leak.
Though I don't own and have never owned any bitcoins, so what could I know.

No, I mean that when you sell high against the market, to push it down, you lose some money. So after you bought low, you want the price get all the way back to repeat the cycle, otherwise you might just as well end up in the red.
At least when enough people on the market know their shit, which, yes, might not be their case, but it's only their fault for not joining the manbearwhale in shearing the idiots and not shearing him as well.
