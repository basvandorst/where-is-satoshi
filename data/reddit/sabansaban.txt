I'm sorry but it is not that simple.  Twitter and FB are the modern day public squares.  Even the most liberal supreme court justices have said as much.  And with that, they can not just censure whoever they want.  Take  [*Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins*]( for example, the US Supreme Court ruled a private mall could not silence high schoolers critical of the U.N. because the mall was a public square necessary for the dissemination of ideas.  The Supreme Court agreed that free speech would be infringed since the public square had shifted to a private business (the mall in this case).

Except if Twitter is censoring conservative voices and promoting liberal voices through fraudulent trending algorithm (what they got hauled in front of congress for a year ago).  Facebook admitted to manipulating their trending news section and then they removed it entirely, probably because regulation was a legit possibility in the future.  These acts are an in-kind contribution to a specific candidate by Twitter/FB and will result in the usgov cracking down on them

Also, Moore's Law has been basically dead for a while now.  
  
Altered in the mid 70s and now reality can't keep up with the "law".

It's pretty much true.  Trolled Hillary Clinton so bad she labeled an internet meme frog as a hate symbol.   
  
One of the most ridiculous events in political history.

GBTC is not an ETF its a trust, its not sold on an exchange, it's OTC.  it also only holds BTC, charges 2% fee per year and prices BTC at like 40% premiums.  and it has 1 year lock up period for selling shares to the public or something like that   
  
it sucks

they are not producing economies of scale necessary to compete with the big players in automotive.  the $7.5k tax credit is no more and is only $3.75k right now and is going away by 2020.  this makes the idea of tesla turning a profit off the model 3 practically impossible.  that coupled with the profit margins on tesla cars are so small (actually negative overall right now) that they will simply not be able to cover the enormous fixed costs associated with automotive.    
and continue their streak of 9 straight non profitable years after ipo (they've only had 3 profitable qtrs) .  don't forget tesla has a $1 billion convertible notes hitting maturity in a couple weeks that require a stock price over $360 or cash settled.  that added to their existing interest expense of $700 million would mean even decent positive profit per car in the future would still not be enough given their projected revenue  for the next couple years.  
they are a very hype driven company that is at a crossroads right now

Do not use coinbase's recurring transactions.  
  
Use GDAX and [GDax Hoarder application]( to dollar cost average.  I didn't make the application but have used it for months now.    
  
Coinbase's fees are 60x higher than GDAX's fees.

Military spending equates to around 15% of the annual budget.  Yes they need to be cut and waste removed but real cuts have to be made to mandatory spending...SS, unemployment, Medicare have to be drastically reduced.  Wish SS could be opt out but it's simply the largest Ponzi scheme in world history.  Cutting the military alone won't even put a dent in the growing debt...our interest payment alone is about to pass the amount we spend on the military annually.

they target a different customer.  gdax is for more experienced users who would otherwise use a different exchange if coinbase tried to charge high fees.  
  
just use gdax, coinbase is taking roughly 10% on small orders.  even large orders, like 100 bucks they still charge 3%.  gdax charges pennies plus you can set limit orders.  Don't forget the market price on coinbase is usually 0.5% higher than on gdax.

"about 54% of the fiscal year 2015 U.S. discretionary budget"  
  
*discretionary budget*  
  
The discretionary budget is not the whole budget.  Mandatory spending is not included in the discretionary budget.  SS, Medicare, unemployment are not in the discretionary budget.  
  
In terms of the ENTIRE federal budget, the USA spends 15% on the military.  
  
You don't even understand the topic at hand.  
  
Military spending is not the problem.  Cutting the military to zero would not even solve the problem.  That is just how big of a debt hole we are in as a country.  We spend $2.5 trillion a year on medicare, SS, unemployment...5 times more than we spend on the military.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:06:30
And the 2018 federal budget is estimated to be 4.1 TRILLION.  
  
this will never be solved unless entitlements are cut.  And cut drastically.  
  
Military is actually something outlayed by the Constitution (article 1 section 8).  Social security obviously is not.  That isn't to say the military is without fault.  There are massive cost overruns there as well.  But it comprises a much smaller piece of the pie than entitlements do.

i feel LTC will be a bigger jump.  i see it hitting $100 within months, given today price you could have 71.2 LTC and that at $100 would be $7116

"fair share" such a stupid term  
  
the top 1% of income earners pay 40% of all income taxes collected  
the top 5% of income earners pay 60% of all income taxes collected  
the top 10% of income earners pay 71% of all income taxes collected  
the top 25% of income earners pay 87% of all income taxes collected  
  
they are already paying way more than their "fair share"  
  
instead of thinking of ways to take from others how about we stop spending so much at the federal level.  we will be over $30 trillion in debt in a couple years with no end in sight even though federal tax revenue are at all time highs

coinbase has gdax, which is an actual market of buyers and sellers, robinhood will not have similar.   
  
robinhood is merely a broker and rolls up their fees into the price they sell to you at.  the same way coinbase's pricing is structured, robinhood will be similar.  coinbase's price is marked up compared to the current gdax market price
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:37:37
robinhood won't even have a market.   
  
this wont be the coinbase killer everyone thinks it will be

i know they are but you are going to pay robinhood a higher than current market price so you really aren't getting a deal.

Just set up recurring buy every day on coinbase.  Like $10 or $5 a day.  Dollar cost average by the day that way.  It does have high fees though when using low amounts...99 cent fee for 10 dollar transaction.  
  
Keep it simple

the USA operated fine without income tax from beginning of the nation until 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment (1% tax rate on income over $3k and 6% on income over $500k)    
  
capital gains tax wasn't even a thing separate from income tax until 1921  
  
the USA's main source of fed revenue from beginning of the nation until WWI was through tariffs

You don't have to worry about "am I buying at the right time" or the right price.  You buy points are averaged out over time.  And if a dip happens, like earlier today, put a single larger buy in...say $50.  Or whatever you are comfortable with. 
  
But coinbase fees are ridiculous.  You can use coinbase's exchange, gdax though.  Fees are tiny. You just have to send dollars over to coinbase then to gdax then manually enter your buys in daily.  Stick to right when you go to bed or wake up

There isn't enough power on the planet to simply store the number of drawers in bitcoin network.  Much less the needed act of adding 1 to each drawer and then comparing if you are successful.  This makes the operation even more difficult.
But say you theoretically had unlimited funds for power and owned every single computer on earth all dedicated to hacking bitcoin and thousands of years to live......
You don't even know if there would be a large enough value at the hacked address to justify the trillions upon trillions (actually far far greater) of dollars you had to spend just to power the computers to hack the address.
