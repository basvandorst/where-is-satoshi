That makes sense. The reason I was asking is because I've heard about people using just one bitcoin address to receive payments on, and the payer signs the payment with the shipping details inside. I don't know the benefits of just using one address.

Id like to pose the argument that no one and everyone owns the bitcoin. Like i always say, bitcoin is a math problem, an algorithem. Can you own math? No. If i have the private key to my bitcoin, that simply means i have a solution to the algorithem. It means that i have the key. Can others have this key? Yes. They can get this key by guessing the key, brute forcing, etc. So no one owns the key. I simply have a solution to an algorithem.

Addresses are a major opportunity to build a reputation. Yes, tiny addresses would be useful.
Can you explain what vanity addresses are and why you don't trust them?

If merchants werent able, or didnt want, to use a service like coinbase or bitpay, what would be the easiest way for us to set up a payment system to accept bitcoins with high transaction volume?

I think this is a good idea. Because the bitcoin community can choose and pay for a politician who will do what we want. There will need to be stipulations like:
-they must live stream their votes
-they must vote however we like
-they must introduce and try their best to pass bills/rules that benefit the bitcoin community.
-they must report in at least once a week

Forgive me for asking silly questions. Do you send the new customer their address via email? Do you ask the new customer to sign the message to make sure it's actually them?

If this is a true problem for MANY people, onename would be thriving.

How can you do this now?
Several reasons a person would want to. One, to gain a reputation. Two, avoid programming to generate a new address for each transaction.
Three, convenience to just post a picture of your products, along with their price and your bitcoin address.
Edit: Clarified # 3

Quick question. You mentioned that you spent two months redoing your site using the shopify platform. You also stated you used coinbase and bitpay. What were the top 3 website issues that required the most energy when trying to accept bitcoin payments?
