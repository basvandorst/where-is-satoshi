Well, it can be stopped with mods doing their job. Image macros are ok, but they should have their subreddits just as serious posts and comments should have theirs. Or as we also call it, Lex @_date: 2012-06-25 17:49:27
No, it's a matter of mods doing their jobs keeping the subreddits rid of image-macros.

Not really true, just unsubscribe from the default reddits and you are set. 
Unsubbing  my accounts from and etc has really made reddit worthwhile. Places such as and are great and fun.

I agree that this sub should be non-ideological. I like socialism-democracy ( !== ) and a bit of cryptoanarchy (to secure that balance of power), but am into bitcoin for it's technology. It's getting on one's nerves when everyone here loves libertarianism so very much. Cripples the conversation, if you understand what I mean. 
If bitcoin-libertarianists had their own subreddit it would be fine, but I would love if this one was for technical matters and maybe econimical. 
But that's just me :)

Sooooooooooooo, the FBI is trying to catch drug sellers, and drug sellers use cryptocurrency. Is this news?

Should not be needed. The file 'wallet.dat' contains the information used to claim your money (the private key). It's placed somewhere different than the app. On Linux/Unix (except Mac, AFAIK) the wallet.dat is placed in ~/.bitcoin, in Windows something like %APPDATA%\Bitcoin, on a Macintosh something like ~/Library/Application Data/Bitcoin. 
But if you're on Windows or Linux, you should try Electrum. It's really neat.

Yes but to generate a new private key and a boatload of public ones is easy - if the virus creator wants to be anonymus it is very easy. S/he could even create a webwallet and signing up with mailinator and TOR, and would be absolutely anonymus in half a minute.

No one will judge if you remove the link, just saing :).

Wait, are you implying we were first with QR in phones?

It could be as simple as that they are not in the mining business, but in the business of making hardware.
