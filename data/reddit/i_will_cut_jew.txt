So what you're saying is you have nothing positive or constructive to contribute to this post?

It's not. It's ever evolving. There's a team of 8 on this one. Couldn't get anywhere. The data is time sensitive, hence the reason to resort to just paying the ransom. Thanks for the response.

We only have a corporate CC. No cash. Thanks for the good info.

No need to apologize but it is appreciated. I wish we didn't have to and any other time we would restore from the previous day's backup except this time we have some work that was done by the projects team that we cannot lose. $800 is chump change, the pain is trying to acquire that sum with a short period of time. I've had some great info PM'd to me that we are following now. Thanks again.

We have a BDR that backs up every night. Yesterday's attack happened after the EOB and before the BDR kicked in.

Is there a limit? Some will only let you buy $100 worth per week. We need $800. Thanks for the quick response!

Exactly. If it was any other day, it would not be an issue, we can restore. It's a project a team was working on this particular day that we need and we don't mind paying the $800 in BitCoin, it's just trying to acquire that sum in a short time span. I have received some very helpful PM's that we are following now. Thanks!

We will have a cache a BitCoin from now on.

With the same card? That might be an idea. Thanks again!
