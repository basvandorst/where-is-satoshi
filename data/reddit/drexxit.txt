Well, to be honest, Dogecoin would actually deserve that AAA rating based on statistics alone. Speed, Cost, Security, Community - all A+

It is the fastest and cheapest to use crypto out there. Perfect for use as "cash" - Ironically, it makes BCash look like the joke.

I would ask for a volunteer in the beginning or after your intro. Just say " I need a volunteer that has a smartphone and wants free money" then send this person money so everyone can see it happen. This way you are still showing the ease of transaction to everyone to grab their interest early on.
This is a pretty sweet presentation, good luck!

Someone influential to the people of Greece would need to back the Bitcoin idea publicly. 
Also, billboards?
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:03:37
I agree. With both points. Not a huge fan of "bits" either but it's more of the idea I suppose.

Hello again! I figured after you mentioned reddit that you would see this, ha ha. Thanks for the good convo! I am not sure how to use changetip yet , I just got my first tip from it in this thread. You can go to the bottom of the thread where itravelforbtc tipped me and it looks like there are instructions for setting it up.
Ask for me next time you come in so we can geek out some more, ha ha.

I'm sorry but maybe you are not familiar with what a consolidation is? The last (large) consolidation was in the 20s - followed by a 300%+ gain - if we are throwing numbers around here.
Consolidations provide psychological walls of support or resistance. The first "pump" of Dogecoin was initial hype, providing no consolidation periods, hence the easy decline during it's hyper inflationary period.
From what I see, this current rise in price is much, much healthier, containing week-long consolidation periods near the highs of each subsequent leg up in price.
Not to mention the initial hype pump in January was during a time that many still considered Doge still a joke. I think it's pretty clear to anyone paying attention in the crypto world that Doge is no longer a joke - unless one is in denial.

No, I wait tables for a steady income and spending money. Trading stock is a performance based job and I do not always get a pay check. It takes time to develop a certain trading mentality to be consistently profitable. In the meantime I work in a restaurant and basically get paid to socialize with friends and guests :)

You seem awful confident about that statement. The world has more variety than you think my friend.

It is Digibyte - not Darkcoin
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:40:39
Ironically, I also trade stock for a hedge fund full time during the days. I would never give investment advice though as I day and swing trade (except buy BTC and DOGE) ;)
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:21:11
I understand this. It's more of a psychological thing when newcomers see 1 coin is $400+ if they want to buy $100 worth they are getting a fraction of something.
Whereas if a new potential adopter sees that for the same $100 they are getting a large amount of bits they may be more willing to be involved.
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:07:34
sure thing pal :) have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-12-28 05:32:48
Thank you!

Got it this time. Thank you again! It was a pleasure :)
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:33:38
You define a trend in this case by higher highs and higher lows, or, lower highs and lower lows...And then you choose your timeframe, so in the long term time frame bitcoin is trending higher but in the short term it is trending lower.

It is sad to hear bitcoin being talked about in a restaurant? As a waiter I have a pretty good finger on the pulse of what the general public is buzzing about and I was just excited to finally hear bitcoin being spoken of without me being the person to bring it up :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:26:48
Agreed. Switch to Bits.

I never rely on technical analysis alone. They are merely part of the equation. I also do not trade bitcoin. When I trade stocks, price action and tape reading is the most important tool for me, but I wanted to point out the clear pattern on the long term chart here.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:09:28
I am not sure where you are going with that statement? If someone gave me $100 worth of Doge I could convert it in to BTC or any other altcoin within minutes, should I want to.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:11:21
Yea good luck with that.
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:48:20
Woah, so generous, many thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:55:59
Short squeezes can be epic. If Bitcoin is to succeed, then it is just a matter of time.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:01:05
This is the weekly chart. As a day trader that uses technical analysis on a daily basis, it is clear to me that the long term chart of bitcoin is currently forming a bullish wedge pattern. We have also just touched an important supporting trendline drawn from the lows. A strong break above the top line of the wedge (and through $500) would be a good indicator of a kick-off to new highs. In the meantime I would expect this chart to continue it's current pattern, likely tightening up.
While technical analysis is only an indicator, these patterns do repeat themselves over and over in the markets.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:24:23
True. But without being in the game, you miss out on all the emotions that go along with the ride.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:58:43
Dogecoin. Market cap of bitcoin has fallen 75% in the last year, litecoin -95%, Dogecoin +.05% It has proven itself, has viable parameters to actually be used as a currency with just enough inflation built in to promote actual usage and spending (bitcoin promotes hoarding) and the volume and transactions in the coin continue to be massive. That being said, I hold both BTC and DOGE.

I forgot to set a transaction fee back in April or May once, and it took about 3 months to confirm.

Dogecoin :)

Wedbush is a well respected agency among wall street traders. Dont worry about the $400 price target, they are constantly re-evaluated and adjusted. Just the fact that they are putting a HIGHER price target on it (or even covering it at all) and writing up such a nice review is just going to perk up more ears on wall street.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:25:01
Hardly a collapse. More like a pullback. I'd be more concerned if it gets back below 260

She is the funnest damn thing you will ever drive. Quick backstory on this car - a group of "renegade" designers at BMW wanted to build the most fun car they could afford for themselves and built this car outside of work in private. They pitched the idea to BMW and made a very, very small build of these cars.
One similar to mine, with 45k miles, just sold for 28k a few days ago. I have 84,xxx miles on mine but otherwise it's in great running condition, asking 20k or the equivalent in Bitcoin (I'd prefer to sell for BTC)
I can post a more formal listing when I get a chance. I wanted to see if this was kosher first.
Thanks for looking! I will be out most of this evening so I apologize if I do not reply right away
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:21:30
you have no idea what I am selling my friend. But I understand your view. Do some research on the car if you'd like
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:28:57
Sweet ride! I have had my collector car on CL for 2 weeks now. It's listed for 69 BTC - want to pick up another fun car? ;)

Just for a little balance here I'd like to say that as an equities trader for a very active wall street firm, today's "halt" had zero or minimal effect on the market and on trading. Our entire firm of traders spent no time or energy thinking about this issue. Trading was never affected and there was no interruption for us other than our orders being temporarily routed through a different server (which again, had zero effect on trading). Honestly, I didnt even notice this news until my dad texted me and asked me what happened with the NYSE.
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:09:27
It's a love or hate kind of style. I personally love the aggressive shooting-brake design. As for the price, I'm not sure whether you've done much research but these cars are rising in value because of their rarity and story. I actually have mine priced below recent sale prices of Coupes with similar mileage/condition that have sold for mid 20s.

I'm with DesignerAccount here
Think about it, are they going to go out of their way to accept a currency that they supposedly have no intention of holding, AND give a 20% discount to you to pay them this way? Is this just out of the goodness of their hearts? lol
They want them coinz son.

"Lets devise a scheme to get free advertisement to a demographic that we have no anticipation of actually attracting, nor do we care to accept their form of payment, BUT...and hear me out on this one Bob because you're always so damn cynical, If they DO want our product, lets give these guys tens of thousands of dollars off the list price, because, why the fuck not?"

Explain that to me please. So if I run a core wallet 24/7 with port 8333 open, but have no balance of tokens in the wallet, you are saying it is useless? Am I not still verifying transactions on the network by leaving it running?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:03:38
If you're in crypto you gotta own at least a little Doge. Especially at these prices
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:49:16
To be a little more specific- green means the transaction occurred at the asking price, so someone "paid the offer." Red means the transaction occurred on the bid, so someone sold to the highest bidder, or "hit the bid" in trading terms.  And then "The spread" is the difference between the bid and ask. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:32:03
Seems like a brilliant idea
