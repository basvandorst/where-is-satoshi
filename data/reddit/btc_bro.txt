Guys, what is your take on using blockchain.info based wallets? I'm working on a related project and would love to know what you guys feel about this. 
How much of a difference does it make to you guys if a service is going through coinbase / coinkite vs blockchain?

He may be a stupid fuck, but he's about be a very rich stupid fuck.

This is pretty darn epic. I've had major holdups in the past, and I appreciate the thinking!

Alright, that does make sense. 
Also, I see that there's no way I can avoid the 0.0001 btc fee for each transaction. 
Although I'm very happy with the super fast confirmations that blockchain provides, and would gladly pay 0.0001 btc for it, I'm wondering if there's a way to give users the choice between fast confirmations and waiving the fees.

10/10 nice troll

Yes, but that means I'd have to store the private key or wallet password on my servers. 
Which is why I wanted to ask, would you as a user, rather trust me (an independent developer / company) or coinbase/coinkite with your private keys?

So, I created TwoBTC.com a few weekends ago just for this very purpose, but didn't really know where to begin using it.
Maybe Adblock will be the perfect start.
The idea is, we all donate to twobtc.com/getadblock , a dedicated account that can only be claimed by whoever owns  on Twitter.
What y'all say?

Keep strong bitcoiners, mass adaptation can do wonders to the btc economy and the general economy in turn!
