Yea it should be easy...every wallet should have an option that you set in... 
If I am logged out for longer than 365 (no activity) then send all funds to wallet address XXXYYYXXXXYYXYYXYYY

Exactly... good option and should be advertised more...

Wallets should just have an option that you set for example, 
IF NO ACTIVITY for XYX days send all funds to wallet XXXXXXXYYYYYYXXXXXX and create that wallet and give PK to the one who you want to get money if you die...
Easy.

Yes and many true traders have multiple accoutns on many non-KYC exchanges even Binance you can have 3 accounts without KYC... so while COinbase userbase might be accurate (around 20 mil) that means its still lower than 8%... binance probably has around 10mil and its the largest in terms of volume... and if top 10 have 30mil left thats quite a bit... then again how many are unique... most people have multiple accounts on different exchanges like myself... so I have 5 accounts... on 5 exchanges... thats means if we combine top 10 exchanges accounts and divide by 6 or so, we would get rough estimate... and then we have to remove the ones like my friends who joined in late december and didnt get authorized by KYC till end of january and then they didnt invest anything... there are quite a few of those.
