Yes, because I asked to be born here and my friend asked to be born in Iran. Don't complain just leave. If you are having this conversation with me, your options can't be that limited

People fucking live in Siberia. Remember the Oregon Trail? Many of those billions have the option to leave, and don't. Sure, it's a long walk, sure, you're leaving your family and friends, sure you won't have money or food. If you really want to leave, you will. (unless you have a special case, such as North Korea or something. Although people up and got the fuck out of there too.)

That store is still on the map, is it fixed? 
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:40:45
We've spoken through email, thank you for the quick reply.
I've sent my wallet address and phone number for the trailblazer reward.
Edit: I'll be trying another store soon, so be ready. :P
