Yeah, I read the post.
I don't agree that Bitcoin can be killed so easily. Individual chains, maybe.

Wouldn't the simple solution to "come together and scale" be for Core to implement the SegWit2x weight increase?

this is not wishful thinking.
Inform yourself :-)

I'm keeping vague track of what's involved. Of course it would involve getting rid of code written to specifically segregate the networks etc.

So, in order to scale Bitcoin, we're going to postpone short-term scaling while waiting for the LN to save our capacity.
Meantime, we basically force businesses to implement support for altcoins because users are migrating, which is a far greater and permanently damaging (from a Bitcoin perspective) outcome than a base layer upgrade which we would have had all the time in the world to coordinate if we hadn't stuck our fingers in our ears and said exactly what you are saying now, since the days of XT.
You offer no solution, but you refuse anything someone proposes.

Ok, let me put forth what people have been saying for a long time in terms of technical rationale.
- average block size on pre-SegWit chain were touching limit - blockchain had reached max capacity as anyone with common sense could see (no MSc / PhD required) and had long been predicted by Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik etc.
- SegWit address use would have a slow adoption curve even once activated (we are now seeing this play out in reality)
- secondary layer Lightning is still not ready (I believe 18 months was recently given as estimate for readiness, which seems very optimistic - can you point me to any _scientific progress_ on the key problem of routing while taking into account channel funding?
- saturated network was causing high fees, long conf times, and unreliable fee estimation algorithms predictably could not handle it well --&gt; users were leaving -&gt; steady loss of Bitcoin marketshare . Issue is technical (degraded performance due to block size limit), other blockchains with dynamic block sizes unaffected
An increase in the base blocksize would have at least 'kicked the can' a bit on the immediate performance issue that users were facing regularly. Such an increase was even on Core's own 'roadmap' for a long time when roadmaps were still a thing.
I agree that a 2x increase would be insufficient, but it's still better than nothing (not having Lightning network ready).
Failure to scale now means Bitcoin users had to choose between witnessing a continued loss of market share, or defensively hard forking in view of Blockstream and Core's refusal to credibly address the above concrete issues.

I know enough Bitcoiners whose Reddit accounts are older than yours, and who've been in Bitcoin longer (back when it was still a "[peer to peer electronic cash system]( instead of the redefinition to "settlement layer for offchain transactions").
But most of them are censored in this sub now, so you won't find their opinions here.
Transaction fees are relevant unless adoption does not matter to you. If you think they are irrelevant you need to explain how you expect people to fund multiple LN channels at tens or hundreds of dollars per channel opening/closing in future.
BTC has become a collectible for hodlers and a toy for speculators, that's about all.
I think you understand the market will not support a lack of utility forever.
Yes, LN on BTC is still not practically usable as a scaling replacement for on-chain payments, even after more than 4 years of development.


Let's talk again when some more people try to use it.

In my experience they're not anti-Bitcoin over there, just have some different ideas on scaling and what went right and wrong in the past.
