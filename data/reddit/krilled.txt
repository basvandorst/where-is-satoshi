It's a list with several aspects, mainly to gauge that adoption across the board (cryptos, exchanges, projects) of all these things is high.
Coinmarketcap isn't a crypto, but it's there because it's almost in the top 100 sites in the world and the most visited crypto project in existence currently.
Steemit isn't technically a cryptocurrency, it's the block explorer for Steem and it's on the list because it's almost one of the top 1000 sites in the world - and for a live functional blockchain, that is huge.

Oh joy! What a good idea! Large banks getting involved in Bitcoin!

If you were out, a bookmarks bar wouldn't be very accessible to you - whereas remembering a URL would be.
You could easily just create a public hash for use on this site when necessary, and keep your private ones hidden.

You should read 'Antifragile' by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the de-facto master of all things risk, probability and black swans.

Hi, thanks for the reply.
I'll take a look at this.
@_date: 2015-05-12 23:10:40
I'm hoarding blockchains.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:09:08
Smaller chain - in the UK.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:13:30
They're small in the UK, with only 10,000 employees, 580 stores and less than 5% of the UK grocery market share.

@_date: 2013-03-28 11:08:52
Which marketplace did you use, being UK-based?
Inquiring because I've had a bad experience with previous marketplaces and want to find a better one for the UK.
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:23:28
Too many coins IMO.
Bitcoin's only just gaining traction as a utility currency.
Litecoin has less than half of the traction of Bitcoin.
I don't even know what Terracoin is, but it sounds pretty generic and I doubt it has 10% of Litecoin's traction.

If you read the reddit sidebar it'll tell you how to buy, which is the interesting 'happening' at the moment and the most likely way you found out about BTC.
There are no viable ASIC's at the moment.
The butterfly labs ones would be excellent but no one knows if they even exist yet, so it's not worth pre-ordering one.
I'm a website developer so my interest lies in creating tools and services that people will use as bitcoins become more popular. Donations are ever-helpful, as are investment offerings, and I'll gladly develop any BTC website ideas you might have (at cost).
Enjoy BTC :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:15:08
2 years ago 5 BTC was like $0.05 so they probably cost way more.

Not yet, this is a planned feature however.

Seeing as this is the highest and first time it's peaked to this extent, I'd recommend waiting at least 3 months to see where things go.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket on this rise. All the people who are speculating that it'll hit $500 are the people who have recently profited big-time on their earlier investments.
Much like poker, they're currently on 'tilt' - meaning their emotions are affecting their rationale. Something like this is so heavily weighted to swing that diving in right now wouldn't be the best course of action if you don't have money to burn.
Of course there's a slim chance that it increases to a high of $500 and then what? Suddenly becomes stable? Or everyone sells at some point and it rapidly devalues anyway?

Step up to the secretary, the bank teller.
She's like how you wanna pay, cash? BTC it's far sweller.
She fears me now, know's I'm the real seller.
My pants a little tighter, my hair a little geller.
My pants tight, my tee white, chains bright, my teeth white.
Hour later on the Private Jet, in flight.
To my next show, to drop my best flow.
Wearing red overalls, like i'm Mario.
And where Yoshi? He backstage. Turn the page.
He's primed, fresh, green like a grenade. Get paid.
Tip that waitress a Satoshi, get laid.
Another day. Another ho to get played.
Yo, we BTC made, millionaires.
Spend that shit, blaze that shit, got no other cares.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:15:12
No balances yet, might add this as a feature soon.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:24:05
So what do places like this trade at?
Market value? Sounds risky seeing as it's climbing and diving by like $10 a day at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:11:44
Yeah it kinda goes above and beyond stocks and shares, which I think is how it's portrayed atm.

No one knows if they are mass producible or deliver the specs they promised because there is little evidence of this.

When I originally posted it, I incorrectly stated it was a guide to VC, which is an umbrella term but generally used to refer to high-level investor movements in later-stage funding (not seed funding, as this article refers to).
You were the one who mentioned project backing, I didn't.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:30:49
Cheers for the correct terminology! :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:41:57
Bitcoin have been hard to get in the UK, and for such a low amount you're not going to get a decent rate anywhere.
All in all you're best bet is treating Bitcoin as something that's going to big, and paying attention to it. If you're a developer, maybe put your skills to use and grab the API and start making sites.
If you can't develop Bitcoin projects yourself, see if you can get your money in for a % in someone else's.
This guide on VC might be useful too: 
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:41:50
Oh that's awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:31:39
So you don't have 'disposable income' but you went and bought a Bitcoin?
If I were you I'd send him $75 back (or more if you're feeling generous) and not bother buying him Reddit Gold for $3, cause it probably won't improve his life in any way.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:42:27
P.S. If you have any ideas for BTC businesses/ websites/ tools/ services/ games that you'd liked developed either for you (as a contracted development) or even split with me (investment style) - don't be afraid to fire a PM my way and I'll show you my portfolio and we can discuss it and certainly come to an agreement.
I'm not too busy currently so I'm almost certainly on board.
Nothing is too complex development wise. I can make anything you request, it'll work perfectly first time and it'll be designed nicely.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:29:56
Hi guys! I'll be happy to take any comments or suggestions on the service. 
Here's a link to my user page if you want to see how the pages look - 
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:27:31
Yes, sounds like a pretty good idea.
Let me know if you'd like to do this, I'm a high-level web developer and I could make everything you asked for here pretty quickly(at cost), or anything else you might have an idea for.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:21:16
I have a number of Bitcoin related developments that I'm seeking funding for. PM me if you'd like to talk about these.
Tips greatly appreciated.

There are some, but they cost 70BTC which is loadsamone.
