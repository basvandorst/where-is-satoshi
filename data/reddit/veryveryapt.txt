@_date: 2018-01-14 18:29:12
hahaha what the fuck are you arguing about then?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:51:20
Only a little bit but it still stings! ha

@_date: 2018-01-07 22:49:50
Who knows
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:32:04
That is a cool feature. If I had an iphone I would download it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:05:17
And if they dont drive the price down enough?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:12:44
I have all but NEO
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:34:44
I just tried with a prepaid mastercard and it says the prepaid mastercard needs 3d secure.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:07:43
Insane bet
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:36:42
Who is saying that? Links?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:12:27
proof you put 100k in?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:37:19
hopefully these manipulators can manip it the fuck up!
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:42:26
Uhhhh no. We've had that news before
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:53:25
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:50:35
Just sold some btc and feel fucking dirty. that little bit will probably be worth 5k in a few months
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:28:46
Also not available on any popular exchange and not accepted anywhere
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:37:30
That was really well written

"You should have called it BCash"
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:33:10
Will the person getting tipped need to be in a LN hub?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:59:28
What segwit address? In a different wallet? Which one? How do you sweep the bcash on myceilum?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:52:43
I just checked coinbase (which now says +3.51%)
Looking at gdax looks a bit better :)

ok now lets hear from somebody whos not a complete retard
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:14:10
you forgot distributed
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:36:05
Does FIFO mean if you got a small bit of bitcoin at 500 usd and bought a lot more at 17k, you pay the capital gains based on the 500 usd buy?

@_date: 2018-01-04 23:11:16
And you keep your coins yourself right? That's amazing bruh!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:25:10
Wait, why did you get in in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:53:39
And we're all thankful for that :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:18:29
Why didn't you write down the 12 words? I'm sorry to be the one to tell you that your coins are lost forever without those 12 words.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:36:33
edit: -1.24%
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:53:16
Can you point me in the direction of a good source to learn about that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:01:36
Do you wish BTC was a usable currency?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:41
to what?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:00
Yeah, what happens if you don't?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:06:58
I had that thought as well and it seems to make sense
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:04:43
Turn off your laptop kid.


@_date: 2017-12-27 21:43:23
Cool. I've never cashed out and really have no plans to at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:58:08
Read the whitepaper
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:34:21
I don't know what that first thing is.
'Groceries', american? where? tx fees?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:43:07
wow, thanks!
edit: and you're the OP. nice one
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:26:42
Is this just america?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:30:22
I know my local laws. Americans need to learn theirs!
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:22:36
Still? I don't think so
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:34:39
Not yet..
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:07:54
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:26:05
How does it manage to have no transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:44:25
Fungibility is fundamental
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:27:20
That's not a useful post and you weren't saying it at the time
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:50:41


Just because bitcoin is going up at the moment does not make it low risk. Just because the value has gone up for you does not make it low risk. It could go down tomorrow and down even more the next day. You may be poorer tomorrow than today.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:39:17
Get some BTC and you'll see
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:52:05
If you want to feel secure then it is worth it
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:49:42
So what are you arguing with me about? You think you're Warren Buffet and think you'll make a quick buck off bitcoin? I don't give a fuck. Go to or Go into your local casino. All you are is a gambler. Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. It has the ability to be revolutionary and people like you are doing it a disservice.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:37:57
It's a terrible store of value at the moment. Until it becomes less volatile it is not a good store of value.
Unfortunately it is also poor at being a currency at the moment. I believe these things can be resolved but the timing could be important to the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:03:53
Terrible analogy. Starbucks is a company and we have no reason to support it. Bitcoin is an idea/protocol/revolution
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:22:20
Whoever spelt it dealt it
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:17:12
What ELSE is he in?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:33:18
Wouldn't it be great if this guy could just talk like a normal person?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:21:20
No! That is not good.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:13:21
How did he convert the 32mb blocks to 1mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:25:01
With small blocks this is probably less of a problem but I'd like to see an answer as well
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:25
I know your post is a few months old but you seem to know what you're talking about. Will banks care if I have bought Bitcoin (coinbase) and not realised the gains? I have enough for deposit in my savings account and more than enough coming in every month to pay the mortgage? So I have bitcoin but I won't use it in relation to my house/deposit/mortgage
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:05:01
fake and straight
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:33:50
What makes you think it's about S Korea? Where is everyone getting their news?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:18:33
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:50:56
and litecoin is awesome
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:57:56
I'm not an expert but fast, low fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:10:59
Just read it. What's so complicated? They even mention complicity vs simplicity! It sounds like you just either don't understand it (educate yourself) or you are downplaying it because you don't have a stake (my advice, get some ADA) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:46:09
So lets round it up to 20k right now. If you had 3 grand to invest today you would only end with 9k.
If you put that 3k into an alt.. you could get more
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:05:26
Random comments with no proof?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:17:54
Why Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:49
Are you even a millionaire?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:28:00
I copied and pasted what is on the sidebar of this subreddit. Good job on knowing what sub you're in.
Are you suggesting that I think the long wait times and high transaction costs are a good thing? Those are things that need to be fixed or bitcoin won't be around in 50 years.
As for using a credit card... if you don't understand the ideology around bitcoin then please spend some time here and learn but if you do understand it and don't care.. I think you're in the wrong sub, buddeh.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:22:00
Opposite way round mate
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:59:16
no they don't. who knows? inb4 you say whales
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:57:36
Nothing is as tested as bitcoin though
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:00:37
sorry we can only zoom in
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:23
I actually laughed
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:13:04
Have you been to Hanoi? You're not going to walk into any highend store and buy any brands with a minimum wage job.

He is learning right here
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:46:46
Well I bought in because I support the tech
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:56:13
I *think* I did but can't be sure. Didn't see any bitcoin signs unfortunately..
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:01:10
I saw a guy fall off and his head was trampled on.
He stood up.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:55:57
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:03:10
Why LTC? I mean I just bought some more last night but would like to know your reasoning.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:35:18
I am just back from Japan and didn't see one Bitcoin or cryptocurrency related thing
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:50:07
ICOs are completely different tho?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:00:14
I spent something like 0.031 of a bitcoin ages ago and I still regret it
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:56:26
I'm actually doing the same
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:34:41
Who cares where he learns once he does
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:27:33
it's down
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:11:11
How about XRP?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:50:06
Past performance not being a measure of future results
