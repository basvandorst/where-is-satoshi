Last year = a period of time encompassing 12 months = got in after 30.05.2017 =&gt; checking lowest price in the last 12 months =&gt; lowest BTC price in the last 12 months is 1679 EUR =&gt; checking price today - 6460 EUR
According to my math, your post is bullshit.

Gold and silver have been around for thousands of years. Fiat currency use was limited in ancient times.

"When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them."

If you're stupid enough to hold your crypto on a centralized exchange then you kinda have yourself to blame.

You must be a big idiot if you bought bitcoins on a margin. Who does that in such a volatile market?

Don't buy more than you can afford to lose. Ever.

I'm tired of people who have no idea where the value is. The value is in the decentralized, trustworthy ledger. The value is in the infrastructure which is provided by the miners and the nodes. Of course there is value in that. You parrots have heard a prominent Wall Street investor, who has absolutely no idea what a cryptocurrency is, say that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and now you're parroting the same shit without even thinking.

I can afford to lose 10 000$ , are you implying that a 100 000$ cashout wouldn't impact my wealth?
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:21:35
Solution: Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:05:23
It's not about net worth, it's about annual income. I don't have much money saved in the bank but I have an above average annual income. I can afford to lose 10k, that won't impact me much but still, i consider 100k to be a significant chunk of money. I think you're severely underestimating what 10x return means.

It's hard to think rationally right now when you bought Bitcoin at 9000 lol. I've even seen some fools buying Bitcoin on a margin for that price. I want to see their motivational/philosophical pieces.

You don't see the crash until you see the crash. In the end, the most important thing is if you have faith in the product you invest in. Bitcoin and cryptos in general are a revolutionary technology, the question is which crypro is going to be allowed to enter the mainstream and if regulations won't wipe out the whole cryptomarket as governments are increasingly worried about this new technology.

Are you implying people who don't have billions are inferior in their predictions or intelligence to those who have?

Cash is very uncomfortable for the government. It enables money laundering and tax evasion. Traditional bank transfers are better but still lacking because some banks might show you (an investigating government agency) the finger if you don't have jurisdiction in the particular country. That's why the americans have implemented FATCA but there are ways to circumvent that as well. At the end, we have the blockchain, where every transaction can be followed right back to the beginning of the protocol. Now that's what every government dreams about. Traditional money are on their way out.

Many of the existing cryptos are just bubbles but cryptos like ETH and NEO are really revolutionary because they enable you to create your own distributed ledger on their network. That's increasingly interesting for business.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:03:04
If they start buying like crazy, the price will skyrocket. That's not a good idea for them. They'll just lobby the government to get rid of it.

Sell crypto for fiat, no need for a loan. But srsly, who says you can't take a loan in crypto? Just because there's a ready infrastructure for a token we've been trading for decades, that doesn't mean such infrastructure won't be built for the token of the new age - crypto

A blockchain ran by a dozen of the most powerful international banks or governments can provide a much more free market oriented reserve currency. The decentralization will ensure no internal monetary manipulation by any of the involved players. Achieving decentralization isn't something impossible, especially if international policies which support such decentralization are implemented. Not to mention that the implementation of such a blockchain can cut costs dramatically and can enable the transition to a one world currency, which is the  globalists wet dream.

Efficiency is not a problem. There are proof of concept cryptos that achieve more than 100000tps. The current system is much more efficient because it isn't decentralized and has been optimized over many decades. I'm not saying that any of the existing cryptos is going to replace the current infrastructure, I'm saying that it will happen at some point because a decentralized system, when implemented correctly will cut costs and be more efficient in terms of operational cost.

I see you're missing the important thing about BitCoin - it's the gateway to other cryptos, which solve many of BitCoins problems. It's a volatile market, some assets are overvalued but make no mistake - crypto currencies are the future.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:43:06
NEO can theoretically achieve 10k transactions per second. Efficiency is not the problem, bureaucratic and state machine sluggishness is. Slowly but surely, the government realizes the potentials of the blockchain - no more money laundering, total oversight etc. Of course, they won't adopt any of the existing coins, they'll just create their own. But make no mistake, the blockchain is the future.

It won't be BitCoin. They'll create something new. BitCoin doesn't have the thechnical potential atm to fulfil that role. Neither will the banks want it to. But it has the right properties, which will be adopted.
