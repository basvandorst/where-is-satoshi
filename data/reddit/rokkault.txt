Thanks for your reply.
My orders were put in between 1 and 3pm today. The price went to 515 at 9pm, 6 hours later.
Baffled. The orders I had placed were the result of an advanced order, which to to sell at a certain price (that happened between 1 - 3pm today), and then buy at a lower price as the followup action. 
Here's my order book on Kraken:
Here's the graph from today, showing at low at 515eur/btc:

Yeah, there's no explanation I can see.
Have opened a support ticket. Best thing for me to do until they reply is to not touch anything, but that's mega frustrating, since the price is rocketing up for the moment and I'm left not holding the bitcoins I should now have. Arrrgh.
If this is indeed a screw up on their behalf, I would hope that they'll compensate me for my loss of position.

Anyone know where to download historical buy/sell data for Kraken? Their site only goes back a few hours. Would love to see what actually went down around 9pm GMT today.

Why not put the actual subject in the subject line instead of "N00b question"? That subject tells us sod all.

"Pretty basic" in which region of the world? Are you talking US there?

100% scam?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:00:12
No, I bought 2 BTC at 400. 2 * 400 + 500 = 1300.

Oh I get you now. Would it really work this way? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:49:57
Yeah, that's kind of what I thought. Cheers. Oops, just realised there's an error in my maths too.

Thanks for the info about CGT - I thought this might be the case.
