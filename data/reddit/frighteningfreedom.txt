Every now and then, a reddit name makes me laugh when I read it.

All I'm hearing from you is "the early adopter advantage" is unfair. **Advantages** are by their very definition unfair to those who do not possess them. I hate to break it to you but the early adopter advantage exists far more prominently in other assets than bitcoin. Housing prices compared to 10 years ago? Some might say this is unfair to new home buyers.
Just because an individual was not aware of bitcoin in 2009 does not mean that is unfair. That's like saying patents are unfair because all the early adopters patented all the easiest things to invent first.
I think you have to understand that every single year is going to be composed of **opportunity** mixed with **difficulty**. In 2009, the opportunity was discovering bitcoin - the difficulty was deciding if it would actually work. I think you need to understand that very very few (if not nobody at all) in 2009 thought they would become rich from bitcoins, just look at how someone paid 10,000BTC for pizza in 2010! Today in 2014, the opportunity present is the availability of easily acquiring bitcoins, the difficulty is deciding for yourself whether bitcoin will continue to grow or not. 
Your concept of the the early adopter advantage being unfair is flawed, flawed in that you are thoughtless to risk someone takes by investing in something before someone else. You may think early adopters are selfish because they don't want to relinquish their wealth, but I think you are the one who is selfish for wanting a distribution that would benefit you at this point in time.
Disclosure: I am not an early adopter, I have only owned bitcoins for a year.
Edit: Grammar.

Your negativity always gives me a good chuckle, keep it up (Y)

I seen quite an insightful response on this sub a while ago that said the chargeback issue was reduced by the idea of paying for the items upon courier delivery. The items first being delivered first and then being paid for would reduce fraud on the merchant end (since a lot of complaints are that the items never turn up), this does open up the issues of double spending from the customer but it does answer the "consumer protection" issue all new people gripe with. 
This does not solve the issue of faulty products, but I imagine a merchant who actually sends the item is much more likely to engage in PR than someone who simply never sends the items

This is a very powerful idea. It could even be used as a means for the machine to remind you that your time is expiring soon by sending say 1 bit to your change address with a message like "your ticket will expire soon", enabling instant messaging between two parties without any exchange of contact information.

IMHO this is a great idea, internet customers (and merchants) would be much more at ease buying items online if payment was made automatically upon delivery. It doesn't eliminate the need for all consumer protection, but I'd still say it helps to reduce fraud cases from both parties.

The fact that they associate with Bitcoin at all gives great credibility to the technology. These companies are very conscious of their image.

I'd say keeping 100% is too unreasonable... do you know how thin merchant margins are? Its highly unlikely that merchants can find all their suppliers, etc. that will allow them to pay with bitcoin. Not to mention taxes...
Of course, it could happen - just not yet.

Ah you're right, well I guess I'll keep dreaming...

The point that they're trying to make is a little skewed, but what I take from that is large companies will accept anything as long as its considered a liquid source of value by others (facilitates trade) - hence the horse shit argument. But this doesn't do anything except strengthen the idea that Bitcoin is becoming a more accepted source of trade value.

I retract my idea of messages yeah, but as for "ideal use of the limited space blockchain" I'm gonna point at dice games and their many many transactions

OP forgot the "/s", and just so you know... Circle is earning money.

It may be true that as a consumer you get the best treatment when it comes to purchases with a debit card, I don't think at this point in time anyone here can convince you to pay with bitcoin (judging from the way you are shooting down every response with how great your bank is). On the other end of sales the merchant is the one suffering.
I'm not saying you should feel sorry for them and instantly start paying for things with bitcoin, but merchants have the chance and incentive to convince you that its worth using bitcoin if it includes a 10% (or whatever) discount on products you want.

Maybe he's trying to crowd source some sort of mining business... or maybe he's just high.
