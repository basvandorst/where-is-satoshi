how do you embed a price into a bit coin wallet address qr code?
is there a format ?
i know qr code reads can read it somehow because block chain does.

you gotta know the merchants number too. could do the same with any service that uses sms validation, google, coinbase etc..
moot point really. sms is not that secure but it is easy

mpesa doesn't have much traction?
maybe they need to learn how to post in reddit. lol
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:46:09
will signup and try and get my local cafe to try the zero click thing. they tried coinbase app but it took "too many clicks" according to the manager so they stopped.
@_date: 2014-10-26 20:55:23
