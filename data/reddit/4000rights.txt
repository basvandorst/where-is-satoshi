I hadn't given thought to this, but I like you idea.  Conic sans font for sure.

Funny - I just had them tell me that my transaction would be cancelled because they were worried I was fraudulent.  They tell me to try again in a few weeks - perhaps I would have better "LUCK"

I have plenty of reason to understand the hate, and I benefit from it.

No discussion. Just stop buying coins and miners.  It helps those in the pool already.  Opinion post.

Luck required to have coinbase!  Took reddit's advice to use as an exchange with full failure.
On Jul 5, 2013 you purchased 1.00 BTC via bank transfer for $66.61.
Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel this order because it appears to be high risk. We do not send out any bitcoins on high risk transactions, and you will receive a refund to your bank account in 3-4 business days.
Please understand that we do this to keep the community safe and avoid fraudulent transactions. Apologies if you are one of the good users who gets caught up in this preventitive measure - we don't get it right 100% of the time, but we need to be cautious when it comes to preventing fraud.
You may have more luck trying again in a few weeks. Best of luck and thank you for trying Coinbase.
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team

I did contact them, but with a request to purge my account (bank info included) from their databases.

STUPID - Got something similar after requesting account deletion - I had a savings account frozen due to same reasons(s).  Trying to be a bank?
Hi XXXX,
I will put your account in the queue to be disabled, we will email you to let you know when this has happened.
We'll also be announcing when we reinstate transactions in new locations. Here's the official message on the subject:
We’ve recently launched improved security measures related to our Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer processes. We have temporarily limited transactions in some locations, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your home state is one of these locations.
We do not have an exact timeframe for reactivation of locations, but we will make an announcement via our website, blog, Facebook page and Twitter account as we enable new locations. We will also send you a notification email when we begin to process transactions for your state.
Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and will let you know as soon as something changes.
XXXXXX X

Until you get the sorry you look like a fraud email - after waiting 6 days after bank verification for my purchase.  Perhaps next time you will have better "LUCK" if you try in a few weeks they say.  Don't believe what you hear.
