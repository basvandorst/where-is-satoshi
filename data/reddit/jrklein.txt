Update: 5 hours later and I am able to perform a withdrawal.
Attempt to withdrawal less than 1 BTC from CampBX failed.  Hoping this is exactly what they claim (temporary Cold Wallet maintenance) and nothing more.
Clarification:  This was meant to be informative in case others noticed the same error more than 5 hours ago.  My account has been inactive for a while and only contains change.  I was just trying to sweep the change to another wallet before I forgot about it again.  I mentioned I was transferring "less than 1 BTC" before someone suggested this was related to CBX daily limits of 2.5 BTC on unverified accounts.

Intuit has a second lab experiment ( that allows QuickBooks Online users to accept Bitcoin via Coinbase.
According to the PayByCoin FAQ ( Intuit does not charge anything (yet).  The only cost for this service is the 1% charged by Coinbase to accept payments from customers.

When the bank installed their SSL certificate on their web server, they did not install the intermediate (aka "chain") certificate.  Unfortunately, not installing (or incorrectly installing) the chain certificate is a common mistake, especially if the system administrator does not have experience with SSL certificates.
If anyone were to run an SSL test ( against their URL, the results will confirm that the SSL certificate chain is incomplete.
Some browsers (e.g. Safari) will download the missing certificate while other browser (e.g. Firefox) will not.  Hence the inconsistent results between different browsers.

He is referring to [FinCEN Form 114]( and/or [IRS Form 8938](
I am also thinking that these only apply to BTC or fiat balances in foreign Bitcoin exchanges. Side note: Some people seem to think Bitstamp is US based. I think account balances at Bitstamp would need to be reported.  Bitstamp may have servers in the US, but they are based overseas.

I received this scam email as well, via an address I only provided to the localbitcoins.com website.
The scammers combined (stolen?) mailing lists from multiple Bitcoin websites, then sent their scam email through a hacked Sendgrid account belonging Coinbase so that it would appear to be from Coinbase. You'd think they would have made the email a little bit more convincing if they were going to go to all of the effort.  ◔_◔

Is $10 worth the hassle of creating a Gyft account and copying/pasting a gift card code into Amazon?  I suppose that depends on the person.

TL;DR  Miners receive the transaction fees.
The Bitcoin network is comprised of a very long chain of blocks (aka the "block chain") that contains a list of all transaction confirmations. Miners add a new block to the end of the chain every ~10 minutes.  The miners accept as many new transactions from the past 10 minutes as they can into each new block.  In exchange for adding your transaction to the permanent block chain, the miner who found the most recent block receives the transaction fee that you paid.  There is not always room for all new transactions, so the miners give priority to transactions with the highest transaction fees.
This is a fairly simplified/generalized explanation.

Perhaps the cost of running a node is becoming an issue? Some claimed to be able to host a node for $5-20/mo. Is this still accurate? More than $20/mo may be out of reach for many hobbyists?
Estimated current node requirements:
 * Monthly Bandwidth: 150-300GB [1]
 * Memory: 1GB RAM + 1GB SWAP by default, less if optimized
 * Disk Space: OS + 25GB blockchain [2]
**Please reply if you have more accurate node requirements and/or are aware of specific node hosts that cost $20/mo or less.**

Doubtful!  I suspect the Hostel could even replace that "lost" revenue with small markup on exchanges between BTC and local currency exchanges.  Travelers still need local currency.

How does BitQuick handle this particular cash deposit issue?  Do you prevent sellers from listing the banks that have a policy against accepting cash from non account holders?  Do buyers have a way to indicate that their deposit was denied so that the funds can be released right away?

Perhaps you could load up paper wallets in sealed envelopes and have Amazon deliver them?  Keep duplicates in case they are lost, but only for that reason.  Just a thought.

TL;DR This process is completely automated.
The probability that you or I would find the next block is pretty slim.  It could take months or years for us to find a block.  It would not be feasible for you or I to sit at our computers waiting to find a block, just so you can review/accept transactions.
Miners participate in mining pools (e.g. Deepbit, 50BTC, Ghash, BTCguild, etc), which pay the miner a fair share for helping to find blocks so that miners receive a steady income instead of receiving an income once every so many months or years.  If a miner who participates in a pool finds a block, I believe the pool actually coordinates/decides which transactions are accepted.
The pool as a whole may find multiple blocks per hour, but no one is sitting there looking at transactions and deciding which ones to accept. The pool operators program their software to accept transactions based on certain criteria such as transaction fees and transaction size.
