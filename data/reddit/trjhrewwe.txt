 and  are some popular sites that accept Bitcoin, though there are a lot more.
As for if it's "more valuable", it makes few sense to ask this. Actually the price of 1 Bitcoin is greater than 1 US dollar, and the unit price of 1 Dogecoin is less than 1 US dollar, but what does it matter? It's just like any currency exchange. If you wanted to buy a whole bitcoin (you don't have to, you can buy just chunks) it would be very expensive, but then you would be able to buy expensive things with it.
However, before buying Bitcoins or Dogecoins, make sure you know what you're getting in. Even with all the merchants accepting bitcoins, it's still hard to find places to buy things with Bitcoin compared to alternatives like Paypal or credit cards. Also, the Bitcoin/Dogecoin exchange rate for dollars is *VERY* volatile, so if you buy $100 worth of Bitcoins today, they may be worth $50 tomorrow or they may be worth $200. In fact, many people see it more as an speculative investment than a useful currency nowadays.

Casual users can use lightweight clients (Electrum) and avoid downloading the blockchain.
As for blockchain bloat, there are some ideas for pruning the blockchain (removing transaction history and just leaving balances) but AFAIK nothing has been agreed or implemented yet.
Apart from this, what can also happen is that 1) Transactions are grouped / moved off the blockchain (the block size limit helps) or 2) Bitcoin adoption is very slow and Moore's law saves our ass in time
Also, AFAIK, Blockchain bloat has nothing to do with regulation/anonymity. This matters more at the miner level (ability to reverse transactions) than the client level.

This moon is officially sponsored by MtGox^TM.

We're sorry to announce that our moon is experiencing technical difficulties due to fatal flaws in the Bitcoin protocol. Wait until 2019 and maybe we will have fixed it.

Easiest way is just to buy them from someone else. There are various exchanges. Check the "How to buy bitcoins" link in the sidebar.
For casual users, mining is getting rather hard and expensive. It's hardly worth it unless you really want to get into it. For Bitcoin mining to be profitable (get more BTC worth than electricity bill), you're going to need to buy specialized hardware (ASIC chips), which is expensive. I'm not as sure about Dogecoins but I think it's still possible for mining to be worth it if you have certain high-end graphics card models. You can check their reddit (for more info.

Did someone say moon? I don't see no moon here. Move along citizen, nothing to see here. And pick up that can.

To the moon!!1 ┗(°0°)┛ ^^^o
I think we should ban all sell orders from now on until BTC is $10,000, for the cause.
