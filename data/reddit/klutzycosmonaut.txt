Yeah, so I may have overlooked some rather glaring signs... haha

I don't have a credit/debit card with which to buy coins through them, but I do have my wallet with them. I'd heard Paxful was a safe bet, I probably should have done more research though.

I've already posted on the forums and am actually in touch with Amazon now at your advice. The guy's username is Robbking.

Nah, it was definitely my first open trade, and without a doubt the only person that I sent the photo too. I watched the lady scan and activate it, came home, found the trade, made an offer, opened the card up, scratched the code, and sent a picture of that with the receipt. This all happened in 20 minutes or so, then 10 minutes later he sends me a screenshot from Amazon saying that the card had been used (not that it was invalid, but that it had already been claimed by another party). My guess is that he has someone else claiming them quickly away from wherever he is, there's virtually nothing anyone can do at that point, right? And perhaps he doesn't do it all the time, but the guy definitely ripped me off for $60 today.

Do you think I'm safe to log off for the evening? I mean, do I have to be here once the dispute is already started? I've left a kind of detailed message in there for whatever moderator eventually gets to it, with the number for the trade in question, and an explanation as to why I opened the new trade (for the purposes of disputing the older one).

Yeah, I'm not entirely stupid (I like to think at least, haha), I checked the card prior to and immediately after. It was fine, sometime between my opening a trade with him and him sending me that screenshot (I went from Amazon straight to Paxful, which I had been looking at for awhile before going to get the card), someone used the card. I can still look it up and it says that another party has claimed it. I've got a claim with the Amazon gift card department, but at this point I don't know that anything will ever come of this. 
It's a bummer because I genuinely believe in Bitcoin, but I've been sketched out about getting involved myself because of hearing about things like this. I don't have a whole lot of cash to be throwing around, I had actually planned for awhile on spending whatever Christmas cash I might get on bitcoin, and then this happens. Just seems like gambling even trying to acquire any.

Nah, I noticed the difference between 'Check' and 'Redeem' when I was checking it. And I was the only person to hold the card between it being activated and sending the photo to the trader (this was no more than 20 minutes). Someone on the Paxful forums suggested that he is brokering the cards, and was ripped off on his end, so then didn't pay me the bitcoin. Either way it's a shitty situation.

I'm realizing now that I shouldn't have cancelled the trade, had no idea at the time.

Another commenter didn't have very positive things to say about Localbitcoins. Do you see the predicament?
I had to start somewhere, without a credit/debit card, and I just happened to get screwed. 
I genuinely can't see bitcoin going 'mainstream' when it's this hard to even obtain them, and then when you try you get robbed for $60.

Yeah, my biggest question was how that guy even had an account with that much positive Karma. He basically opened our chat with 'I WAITING U,' which gave me pause as is, but I was swayed by the karma.
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:58:30
I just re-opened a new trade, how do I dispute it?
Edit: I figured out I have to wait three hours after I've confirmed payment, haha. Thanks, man. Gives me a sliver of hope.
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:01:19
Yeah, I don't have any kind of credit/debit card, or I would have went through Coinbase. One look at the support forums and it's clear that people are getting scammed, so I definitely should have done some more looking around before trying, I just figured there was no way this guy is scamming people with such a high score.
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:42:42
Yeah, I pretty much counted it as a loss as soon as he sent back a screenshot saying it had been used, I wish I would have known to keep the trade open though. Hindsight, eh?
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:48:20
Another user suggested I open a new trade with him and dispute it, which is where I'm at now, but haven't heard from any mod yet.
