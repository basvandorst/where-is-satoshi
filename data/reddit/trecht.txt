Fuck me sideways in the hallway, when I woke up it had just hit 14k which was insane to me. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:03:42
Got any proof for that, cowboy? 
Because I have:  11.2
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:09:22
It's a pattern. I tried to spread the truth about the removal of the Coinbase app, they were removed because they violated simple rules, and I was down voted. I tried to spread the truth about that crypto chat app, which violated basic rules, and I was down voted. Strange that I get butthurt, huh? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:17:24
Oh the ignorance... 
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:19:20
They are just getting cheap PR from jumping on the Apple hate train. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:19:10
Ever heard of pen and paper? 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:59:36
Well, it is a business, and it's MtGox, soooo....... 
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:59:04
I personally haven't read them, but learned them trough articles like these and doing research. When you sign your apple developer 'contract' you agree with the terms, so you have to comply with them. The only reason it seems like they 'only remove bitcoin apps' is because they are the most reported stories now. But of course, Apple is evil for following their won rules. 
To add, I don't agree with the rules, I just think developers should stop whining when they violate the rules. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:44:17
Or put a proxy web debugger in between like Charles and check the traffic. No guarantee, but easier than decompiling :) 
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:18:28
I'm sorry about your butt
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:24:26
Better specs? Are you sure you linked the right product? It has a slower CPU, WAY slower HDD/SDD combo, bigger screen way lower reso, smaller battery. Only thing that is faster is the graphics card. Not to mention that that laptop is plastic and doesn't have nearly the same build quality.  
And you linked a REFURBISHED laptop! How is that even fair?! :D 
Edit; Thanks for the down votes but I'm still waiting for a product which ACTUALLY is cheaper then a Mac.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:46:31
You realize I was making jokes, right? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:38:05

Eh, what else is there to link then the actual products he provided? The webpage has a convenient specifications tab which lists all the specifications of both laptops. Because the website uses javascript to go to the specifications page I can't link you directly to it, otherwise I would. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:42:26
So overpriced that comparable laptops and desktops are about 100 euro cheaper.

Fair enough 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:46:42
Shit, you are right. There was a link earlier which did work, but I can't find it now. If anything, [the link is still on their website]( I would guess they would remove that ASAP if it were removed
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:43:12
Source? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:58:28
Whoops didn't realize that. Here is what it says: 


Later on it goes into specifying some rules regarding physical objects and all that.
How could they work around this rule? It rules out ever single option to make their own purchase flow, which they obviously want. As for your last point, co-founder of Coinjar states that they are getting sick of Apple's hostility towards Bitcoin, [here]( so I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase said "fuck it, we aren't releasing an iOS app anymore" ^(And I don't blame them for it. My point is not to defend Apple, it's to set the record straight because there is a lot of misinformation in this sub)
Fact is, if Coinbase kept to Apple's rules, there wouldn't have been any problems. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:39:39
That wasn't from Apple, that was from steve jobs. It was a private speech, not in the name of apple.

Take a look at your calendar and make a wild guess why. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:50:50
So, money isn't something to take serious?
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:47:52
Yeah that's part of the problem, the app wasn't updated since july 2012 and had a fatal bug in it that didn't get fixed. ~~If you believe bitcoin wallet apps are not allowed in the app store, [I feel sorry for you](
@_date: 2014-01-03 11:22:28
and that's the way the cookie crumbles. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:39:26
Right, because only negative experiences get blogged about, the positives don't... 
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:44:53
Android has the exact same problems. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:38:22
Haha yeah. But a non government backed currency was a good thing, right?
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:07:21
That's because you probably went to tourist traps. In Europe they won't accept your dollars.

@_date: 2014-06-20 17:27:23
Yeah, because it means nothing. Especially in a store which you can submit anything with barely any review
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:29:47
The games uses Apple's implementation for in app purchases, it's for purchasing non physical, digital, objects. Apple's rules state that an app has to use their implementation for non physical objects. Starbucks can use their own payment flow because it's for physical products, just like eBay.

@_date: 2014-02-07 08:06:55
Not to mention it's completely unfounded. Sure Apples rules are not okay, but all the hate here is from uneducated fools. The Coinbase app got removed because they implemented their own in app purchase flow, this is not allowed by the rules from Apple. Same goes for that crypto chat app. And the block chain app was removed because they [purposely manipulated the review team](
But hey! This will probably also get buried because the people on here clearly don't want the truth to be known. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:13:57
But it was still performed at Stanford, outside of Apple without really a connection to apple, right? Or am I mixing things up?

Where did it say it's a wallet? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:44:43
Hahaha. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:42:13
Because Apple is allowing wallets in the store, as long as they keep to the rules? is super uninformed about Apple &amp; their App Store. They just want to hate and don't want to learn. 
For example: Coinbase was banned because they implemented their own in app purchase flow, that is not allowed by Apple's rules. If they simply remove that, it's allowed in the store. Same with that crypto chat app. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:03:05
The rules are still stupid though.
~~Edit; Yea yeah, let's keep down voting the truth, stay uneducated and stay circle jerking about how bad Apple is. (meanwhile there are still bitcoin wallets in the store)~~
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:27:26
That's not my concern, I have it backed up on multiple locations, my concern is having my wallet compromised and all my passwords stolen... 
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:36:42

App aproval hell? As somebody who has developed multiple apps and never had any trouble, I wonder what you made
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:19:28
So? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:56:45
They removed the apps because they violated basic rules. Blockchain was removed because it didn't receive an update for over 1,5 years and mainly because it purposely deceived the review team. Now they use this to get cheap PR and get their new HTML5 'app' known. Cheap tactic. 
Coinbase was removed because they implemented their own in app purchase flow for non physical objects. That crypto chat app for the same reason. 
The rules are (stupid and) simple. Developers that don't keep to the rules will get their apps removed. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:42:36
I'm not 100% sure about this, but I think there was a fatal bug in the app which didn't get fixed
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:04:35
Ah I see, that was kinda what I meant indeed. Nice, will look into that in the future, thanks for pointing me towards KeePass!

Because people rather circlejerk then know facts in this sub, honestly. This sub is filled with misinformation and people don't seem to want to learn. [(like this for example)]( Same goes for the removal of the Coinbase app, when that happened I mentioned it so many times and I kept getting downvoted and downvoted so I just gave up. I read about the removal of this app on Twitter and thought about this sub so I gave it another try, with more pleasant results. :-)

Haha. Except for the store owner. In this case Apple. People taking selfies is a bit different then setting every single background, asshole. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:07:34

Neither are web based wallets, or any hosted wallet for that matter. But great sensationalistic title non the less! 
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:04:44
I'm not sure what the betting laws in Australia are, and how it's regulated, but it's very much possible that those apps are allowed to operate like that because betting/casino are acknowledged by the government, and bitcoin still isn't.
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:41:40

Good luck with that, nobody will take it serious. 
Haha downvotes. Please enlighten me how you explain a virtual coin (good so far) to your mom (bit harder) which is named after a meme (impossible). Money, funds and all that are serious stuff, some meme doesn't have a place there and will never be taken serious in the real world.

2. It was removed because it purposely deceived the review team

Pain in the ass to type in though
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:51:00
Hi Ryan,
Are the in app purchases in the iOS CoinJar app limited per country? I'm in the Netherlands and I can't seem to find the option to buy bitcoin within the app. I strongly suspect the Coinbase app being rejected because of the reason you listed. (And, if you guys don't have that implementation, would explain why you are allowed in the store and Coinbase isn't. Just like that crypto messaging app) Since Bitcoin isn't (yet) recognized as an official currency, it could explain why they threat those purchases differently.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:40:33

Is that special? My bank can easily do exactly the same
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:10:25
Do you mean the middleman which makes sure I get my money back if anything goes wrong? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:53:55
So where does the money come from? If I pay my mom 1 euro, my mom receives 1 euro and 1 euro exactly is deducted from my account. I pay a fixed 5 euro per 3 months for my account, which was free before
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:05:12


So I'm completely fine with it. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:36:30
I don't pay tramstation fees. I don't live in the US
Down vote me all you want, but it's 100% true. I pay a fixed price per quarter for my account (5 euro) and pay 0.00000000 transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:13:56
Not if you are young. I only started (directly) paying for my bank account this year and I'm 23. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:31:35
Wait. 
So, the X bitcoin I have, I now have in bitcoin cash value too? 
So basically they gave me money, made out of thin air? 
Wat? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:38:49
Thanks for the suggestions in both comments! I'll be able to figure this out. Not sure yet what I'll be doing with my new coins, but I'm super pumped about suddenly finding quite a bit of cash in my back pocket :P I guess this is the easiest money I've ever made

@_date: 2015-03-12 08:50:28


You seemed to miss that.  
Not to mention, 1:1 dollar and euro is a GOOD thing. This means that people from the US are more likely to import from europe because it's cheaper, resulting more trade and more money.

@_date: 2013-12-30 14:10:15
I've mentioned the wallet apps in the App Store multiple times on here, they don't learn and don't want to learn.

Then why buy it on credit? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:02:40
Gliph was banned because they made an option to use bitcoins to pay for a premium account, that's exactly what I said, and is not allowed by apples rules. There are enough app which let you transfer bitcoins: baseline, keepcoin, get paid, coinjar. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:14:31
Not so much the card part, more the credit part :) 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:23:04
Could be. People like that *deserve* to go bankrupt. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:43:18
False. The apps were removed because they implemented their own payment flow for non physical objects, which you are not allowed to do. 
Apples rules are simple, and simple to follow. But of course apple sucks because developers don't follow their rules. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:47:43
That's exactly my point. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:46:29
I don't know. This sub is very confusing to me. It's all professional articles and shit until there is some drop, all of the sudden stupid crap like this is being posted *and* upvoted. 
Also: people on here love to circlejerk about how it's not an investment for them "It's a long term thing!" and when it drops everybody goes crazy. Seriously, if you didn't see bitcoin as an investment, drops would mean nothing to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:01:49
And I can fly. CHOO CHOO I'm a train. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:08:29
the sub of the uninformed.
Bitcoin wallets ARE allowed, just the custom payment flow that coinbase implemented is NOT allowed. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:59:00
Who said anything about gold? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:28:58
Because you spend money on a risky investment which you don't have. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:47:06

Oh I see what you mean now. The difference with gold is that it's actually *backed by something*
