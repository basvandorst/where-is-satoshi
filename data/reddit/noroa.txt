They got 6 in a row as early as january, i believe that is enough to initiate a doublespending attack?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:30:57
Would depend on 1: Price, and 2: speed/stability.
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:26:16
I guess in a decade or two we'll find out :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:04:42
And, how many days was it since they got 6 blocks in a row?
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:37:52
Depends on what you base your logic and math on. My view is that if distributed small scale mining isn't slightly profitable no one would do it, which result into another centralized currency which in my logic has no appeal :)

I'm going to say this, just inb4 all the downvotes: This is not a good thing. No person with their run-of-the-mill desktop can ever contribute meaningfully to the bitcoin network now. Bitcoin adoptation from a miner's side of view is now only for the dedicated with money to burn. Which is why we'll see the rise of Scrypt-N coins, such as Vertcoin.
But firstly, we'll see this post downvoted to nothing.

Don't forget to make GLONASS enabled ones aswell, for that sweet russian cash.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:23:37
I'm guessing there's a patent for that coming straight up.
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:07:39
Yep. I'm a fan of bitcoin, and transaction fees is what stops it from getting huge. ASIC basically ruined it, by making mining something only professionals can do, driving the costs up, and thereby also the transaction fee.
Sure, it's cheaper than most banks. But, for a layperson in a developed country those small savings are usually outweighted by the accessability. For developing countries, where Bitcoin would make so much sense to use, considering how widespread smartphones are, these transactions fees are simply too high.

For reals, assuming this is not a photoshop or just a display bug, if you are willing to become a thief and to live on the run for a few years, buy all you can of altcoins, then transfer them out to private wallets. If/once you get them, go make yourself a new identity, then wait 4-5 years for the market to recover, then live your life exactly how you want.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:23
These days are over, or at least until segwit and lightning are up and running. No sane person will use bitcoin for anything below 10$ these days, the transaction costs are just too high.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:50:09
That's probably not a good idea, considering that fees will be 30% of the price of your product. Bitcoin as a currency for these type of things doesn't really work anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-26 12:50:15
A bitcoin is worth what someone is willing to give for it. Today, people are usually willing to give you roughly 420 $ for it. Two years ago it was around 800 $. Tomorrow, or in a year, who knows.
It's exactly the same as buying a 5 £ note and storing it in a piggy bank. Today people are willing to give you roughly 7 $ for it. In a year, people might be willing to give you 8 $ or 4 $ or maybe nothing at all. It's still a 5 £ note though.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:37:42
Fuck yeah.

If you do a simple whois, you'll find that the site is registered in Norway, with a street address and telephone number, and full name. This isn't a doxx, but you should be able to give the police information enough to get them locked up. Also, not based in Delaware, the domain is hosted and owned by someone in Norway.
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:16:08
You can also report it to the Norwegian police.

I don't follow the debate on different changes to Bitcoin, so I don't know the details, but I was a bit shocked when I saw the transaction fee on localbitcoins being around 0.4-0.5 $.
On an unrelated note, I discarded signing up for bitcoin faucets because I thought I should just buy some. This was at a time when you basically had to buy Linden Dollars and sell them to get Bitcoins, and I discarded the idea as it was too much of a hassle. I'm regretting that very much now.

Transfer it 4 more times, and it'll be worth nothing!

0.26 $ is an exorbitant fee for most of the world.

Check out vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:59:11
That's true, I'm assuming they do have legitimacy even though they morally, or historically don't - simply because they have the means to implement their claim with threat of violence. It's maybe a bit bleak outlook, but I think it holds true in many cases. I agree with you, on the right to decide how to use property or land absent harm to other humans. I'll check out the book, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:12:30
Yep, that's the point, you are free to leave.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:37:02
My point is basically that by chosing to live on a land governed by someone claiming taxes, and provided you are free to leave, you are effectually accepting being taxed and therefore you can't call it theft.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:22:19
I agree that there are many cases where living in a specific land, or under a specific government, is not necessarily a 100% voluntary process. For instance, if you are handicapped to the point where you can't physically move. In those cases it's not a choice you made yourself, but rather a result of your parents having you in/on that particular land. That's tough luck. However, in those cases you are still technically free to leave, it's just immensly much harder.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:15:57
I'm not saying it's fair, or how it should be, but that's how it usually is.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:30:42
I would argue that it is not theft if you willingly live on land governed by an entity enforcing taxation, and that if you do not like how they enforce compliance you are free to leave the land where they apply their rules. However, this is assuming that they won't use force or threats of violence if you should choose to leave the area they control. If they actively stop you from leaving, then I'm willing to agree that it falls within the definition of theft.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:11:06
Yeah, if I were unhappy, I'd probably try my best to leave. Or to actively influence the society I live in, in order to change it more towards my liking.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:54:34
Does the government treathen you with physical violence if you leave their territory? If so, you live in a dictatorship, and in that case I agree that taxes are theft.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:27:03
I'm not arguing that taxes are enforced through the (eventual) threat of violence, and that there is a disparity and monopoly of force in most states/societies. I would think a definition of theft would be to "by use/threat of force aqcuire something currently in posession by someone unwilling to give it over freely". I would argue that by choosing to live in a geographical area ruled by an entity enforcing such a threat, then you are defacto agreeing to it - and therefore not theft. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:34:59
How is it theft, if you at any point can leave the country/government imposing the tax? Sure, it might not be easy, but it's still an option.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:48:39
Watched the whole deflection of a video. I'm not arguing that the state doesn't "threaten" with violence. Still, the argument stands, you're free to leave and make your own society. Not saying it will be easy, but you always have the option. 
Most countries have defined geographical borders, and owns the land in the sense that it governs by it's willingness to use force against persons using that land in a way it does not like. If you absolutely want to "own" a piece of land in an area already claimed by a state, then you just need to be willing/able to use more force than any other entity with a claim to the land. Sure, it's hard to do as one person, but you always have the option.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:15:25
No contract as in signed paper, just the understanding that if you live on territory they consider to be theirs, and if you are unable to stand against their threat of violence with your own threat of violence - then they win and you have to play by their rule.
Does the group "X" you mention have the ability to, by force or other means, stop you from using the blockchain unless you fulfil their requirements? If they do, then yeah, they own the blockchain.
