Physical depiction of coins sure does confuse new people!  But the press needs pretty pictures, unfortunately.
I saw this post and wanted to hate it for confusing newbies.  But it is awesome work, and has value for the media, if released as such.

It was really a list of bids in sorted descending order, from 65 to 55.  And some fool, who has a lot of bitcoin, but no clue how to maximize their value, put in a sell order.  He either put in a "market" order, which means "sell for the max bid", or thought he was putting in a stop loss order, meaning "if it ever drops to 55, then sell".  (Unfortunately, mt gox doesn't have stop loss orders, and so the trade happened immediately.)
Either way, the effect was that it ate up all the standing bids from 65 to 55.
The proper way to execute this trade is to put the sell order at a higher price... say 65.2, or whatever you like, and let the buyers chip away at it.  It takes longer, but unless you're in a hurry, why pay for speed?

I don't know why you are letting your stubbornness get in the way of an otherwise useful post.  Without correction, I feel it's necessary to down vote, because it is flat out wrong.  You are doing a disservice to people who are trying to really understand bitcoin.  This exact misinformation led toward my confusion early on.
It's not "close enough"... what you are claiming is factually incorrect.
"Walks like a duck" argument doesn't hold up, because the bitcoin address cannot be used like a public key, for simple things like verifying messages signed with the private key.
Sorry... it's downright poor teaching to tell misinformation.  Simplification is OK.  Misinformation is just wrong - especially when a simple wording change could correct it.
The bitcoin address isn't a public key.  It isn't a representation of the public key.  It's a function of the public key - and a one-way function at that.
"Public key" has a specific meaning, and the bitcoin address doesn't qualify.  It's much more like an account number than a public key!

If it's any consolation, I just heard from a friend who paid for 100 btc and received 200!   Good old coinbase.

0 always wins on SD as a Lucky number.
You're trying to get a small number.  If you get zero, you win.
Scary you could win that much money and not even understand the rules.

It means that no trades would take place.   I have 1 btC and am willing to sell it for 1000000 Euro.  You will only pay me 70.  No trade takes place.
Picture the exchanges as a giant auction where everyone's in the same room....
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:03:30
Yes, it's a representation of the public key in about the same way that it's a representation of the private key:  it's impossible, practically speaking, to go from a bitcoin address to either the public key or to the private key (unless, of course, the address was used to send money... and then you can look up the public key in the transaction .)
Your link showed that.  Sha256 and ripemd aren't reversible, in the practical sense of the word.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:07:23
Asinine comment not worthy of a reply.  But I'll humor you.
Get back with me when you have a masters degree in finance with a GPA over 3.5, have started a business netting over $20M without outside investors, studied the source code of bitcoin, written software that interfaces with bitcoind (and made money on the software), written code to interface with blockchain.info, and have a net worth over $5M.
Till then, you're just making a fool of yourself.

Yeah, funny.  I'm supposed to prove that you didn't fill out a form.
Jarred isn't in hiding.  Shoot, he's been publicly talking about his projects since the closure of tradehill.  Their lawsuit with dwolla is common knowledge.  His email address AND phone number is easily found on the web.
How do we know you're not a shill for trade Hill's competition.  I'll "proove" (prove) what you asked me to prove, once you prove you're not a shill.  Good luck to you.

If you recently signed up for mtgox, would you mind posting the date you signed up, and your user number (approximate, if you are paranoid About security)?
 I'd love to know this figure as a reference point for how many worldwide bitcoin users there are.  Someone posted it as of mid January in another post.  I'll dig that up for comparison.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:09:44


Actually this is a bitcoin address, **not** a public key.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:03:23
That strategy would fail... transactions, like nude pictures of your girlfriend, once they're on the internet, are public forever.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:52:49
based on the address that you send your bet to, a certain number is defined, along with the odds and payout.  the lucky number, which is calculated from the transaction ID has to be less than that certain number, so 0 always wins.

I think that part of the problem is that you need more good news each day than the previous day if you want the price to accelerate more. Once a day goes by when there's just as much good news or less good news the panic sets in.

Dwolla to mtgox takes hours to days for me.  Basically it happens pretty quickly during japan business hours.
It's not instant.  It only takes days if you hit a weekend or holiday.
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:46:57
Its kind of small.  Any way to inflate it?

I think you don't understand what "down" means.
Just because you haven't been able to buy, doesn't mean they are down.  Ineffective perhaps.  Unreliable maybe.  But not down.

this provides evidence that the seller thought he was putting in a stop loss order at 55 when in fact he was saying sell everything all the way down to 55.

Yeah. that's what I thought.  Claims to be smarter than most everyone here, and yet can't establish credibility.  Asinine.

Jarred has been very vocal in numerous forums as to the claim process.
People filed claims and got reimbursed.  I have nothing bad to say about their ethics.... they got hosed by Dwollla and they made their customers whole.
Fill out the claim form and quit spreading this FUD.
