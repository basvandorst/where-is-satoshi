Yep I'm not sure what it refers to, but it didn't prevent me from sending my coins from gdax to another wallet. I saved a 20$ CAD fee that I would've paid if I had sent the money directly from coinbase to quadriga!

As I said, I can't use gdax since I'm canadian. [proof](

Yep. I can send them back to coinbase for free (and instantly), but there's no way to send funds from gdax to another bitcoin wallet. This is because of the 0/0 available transactions I guess.

quadriga exchange, or through the localbitcoins website.

I just tried moving them out and it's impossible. We're stuck with unusable funds on our gdax accounts.. great.

gdax looks buggy but I managed to send my whole 0.01BTC without paying the network fees myself. I'm testing a gdax to quadriga transfer and everything looks good, already got a confirmation: [See here](

How? As you can see here I am registered and validated but I get a "not available in your region" message... [Not calling you a liar but..](

Thanks, I guess I'm retarded. However before I send my money there, can  you confirm that it's normal for me to have the following notification? Makes me worried I won't be able to send my money out of gdax since it says I have 0 transfers left.

Any luck getting an answer from support? I haven't heard back yet.

Hi, thanks for the update. Should I open a ticket even if I already sent an email to [support ? 
As for the website issues, I will give more details when I get home since I'll be able to see from my browsing history exactly when I encountered them.

Hi u/CoinberryOfficial, I still haven't been contacted by your support team regarding my missing 100$ after 3 days. How long is your average response time?
