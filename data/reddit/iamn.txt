Cool! But this still falls under dissemination of "secret/classified" information that one party had a vested interest in keeping secret, which is fundamentally different from what bitcoin is. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure this case is a classic example of the Streisand effect, where the case against disseminating the number actually lead to its proliferation. I guess the big question is: is there a precedent for speech being limited in a form that is truly akin to what bitcoin is? Afaik there isn't, for the good reason that limiting such speech would be unconstitutional.

That's a good point. So you're saying that in *practice* bitcoin is speech but in *conduct* it's currency, and so it would be treated as the latter rather than the former? Interesting.

Doesn't increasing the block size lead to increasing the amount of state each node needs to keep, though? Or does the pruning stuff they're proposing actually work? I think my Bitcoin-qt client currently archives the full block-chain; so I guess this would need to change as well?

I see what you're saying but the thing is that bitcoin really seems like a kind of speech that is fundamentally different from what you've just described. Think about it this way: people could implement something similar to the bitcoin protocol *manually*, by computing everything themselves and making sure they all meet up every day to vote on which transactions are legitimate and which aren't. *If* they did this, censoring it would clearly be a violation of first amendment rights. But something like you just described, when thought of in practical terms, definitely seems akin to stealing, so censoring it actually makes sense from a constitutional standpoint. Does that make sense or am I just being too naive here?
  
Edit: Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that the *kind* of speech that bitcoin is seems to be something whose censorship would be a clear violation of the first amendment.

Haha you're not too far off in these days ;)

Nice! Everyone should do this!

Sure, but the US government, while they wiretap the hell out of everything, has done a pretty good job with not *limiting* speech-- unless anyone has a good counter-example?
