No lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:54:17
Who knows?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:18:23
Probably when the price drops.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:05:27
Every time bitcoin drops a few hundred people are calling it the dip lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:22:36
You know you can edit comments right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:07
Holy shit this is actually happening.  HODL
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:36
What time do futures start tonight?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:29:20
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:32:30
What do you guys think?  Should I get some rest and see what it's at in the morning, or should I wait for this dip to buy some?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:44:47
Just bought $50 worth, hope it does well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:11
When should we expect a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:53:36
Why is it bad to post your exact amount of bitcoin online?  Is there security issiues if you post your amount of bitcoin to social media?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:31:12
I'm seriously considering buying one.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:06
Try making an actual post, more people who can help might see it there.  Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:16:05
No way, why would anyone ever do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:02
Nope, I'm just hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:57
That's possible, and one of the many reasons I'm mad BCash was added.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:27:53
Probably not.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:49:44
Why not?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:18:04
Pinkie promise?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:47:55
Me too lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:08
Why do you guys think the price is going to soar after this dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:40
Include this comment in the study please.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:31
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:15
Lol I new people would be saying this when it started dipping.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:09
What usually happens? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:12:47
Yeah, they're called bitcoin faucets.  You can watch ads and download apps and stuff for a small amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:58:40
If only they could keep them pinned...
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:08:32
When should we expect a dip in subscribers? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:00:26
Yes!! I was just about to make a post about having daily threads.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:49:25
I do that all the time lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:50
Damn, that really sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:36:56
Let's go all the way to 20k!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:21:55
I really hope it doesn't get to 16k!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:28
What exactly do the candlesticks mean?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:51:13
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:00
Lol, I'll come back here in a few days when the bubble didn't burst.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:40:27
Nice! Probably should've waited for it to dip some more below 15k, but it won't matter when it hits a million ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:33:30
What exactly is the ATH (on gdax)?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:21:53
Lmao, this comment made my day.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:38
Dammit, bought some bitcoin at 14.3, right before it dropped a bit.  Oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:31:19
If you can afford to lose it, then yes.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:59
Username checks out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:23:02
It's up to you, but whenever you feel like it's the lowest it'll get for a few days.  If you think it'll drop below 16k, then wait, but if you're not sure then pull the trigger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:46
1/2 credit.  You missed the second question.  
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:18:00
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:17:00
Hey charity, what can I do for you?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:03:48
Hey it's worth the try right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:24:09
Should I buy now?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:10:40
Is coinbase working to buy some?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:22:46
Honestly, I'd wait a bit but it's up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:22:28
Haha, this is pretty funny.  Bitcoin is really becoming mainstream now.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:24:56
Isn't this a bit of an overreaction?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:13:24
I still use it to get a few thousand satoshi everyday!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:19:35
I bought at 13.9.  Not the lowest part of the dip, but I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:39:50
Noob question here, in the gdax trade history, green is someone buying and red and someone selling right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:24:14
Yeah, but it's not a lot.  If you download a few apps and do it everyday you can easily earn 5 or 10 bucks a week, but it's a lot of work.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:53:30
Until it starts going down again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:54:00
It's all good, just click you 3 dots next to the comment and select edit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:15
It's going up!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:29:05
No, just keep on hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:50
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:59:58
This is my favorite gif
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:30:25
Hey it's me, 's alt I need that back
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:47
What do you mean by 2013?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:57:16
I'm not good at math either, please explain to me what's wrong with this.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:48:51
Haha, good luck :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:57:32
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:45:29
Wait, it's still dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:53
Don't you mean &gt;100k
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:24
Yeah if it drops below 15k I'd pull the trigger, but it's up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:20
Just keep on hodling , I don't think it's going to drop completely.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:48:14
When exactly do the futures start?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:25
We are already awake lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:28:45
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:16
If they do that, can they be sued?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:30
No, chances are it'll dip under 17k pretty soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:30:50
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:12:58
Can we always pin the daily discussion from now on?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:19:40
Should I jump and buy some more bitcoin real quick before I go to bed?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:55
Keep on buying guys!  This is the time!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:55:04
Ah, I see, this explains it.  Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:51:07
I doubt it'll jump all the way up there tonight... but who knows?
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:24:55
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:38:22
And how do you know this?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:28:29
It could get to a million, nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:07:50
Will we get a new thread for November 30th?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:47
What do you guys think is the best bitcoin wallet for android?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:02:08
How much are you buying?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:15:19
And that $3.50 might be worth a lot more in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:23:52
What's the best site to earn bitcoin by watching ads?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:03:21
So what was the exact time that it actually hit $10,000?  No way he guessed it by the minute.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:19
Where are you guys getting the price from?  (I'm new obviously)
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:41:57
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:32
Hmmm... new account and your post history seems kind of fishy.
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:13:08
Who fucking cares
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:07:23
Yeah it's just a really petty argument
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:10:00
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:19:30
Yeah but then anyone who goes into your room might get access to your funds.  Put that shit in a safe.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:43:46
Hes definitely not for real lmao.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:52:50
Nice little run to break through 4k.  Let's see how long it can stay above 4k.
@_date: 2019-01-01 15:46:16
Probably somewhere from $1 to $100,000.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:36:45
Now that the price is dropping, I'll only be able to afford 4 lambos!  Never investing into crypto again.
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:49:18
Not the guy you were talking to but I do anywhere from $10 to $50 based on what the price is doing, the past 2 weeks I bought at $3,800 both times for $25 and $30.
I do this every week on Sunday and am only doing BTC right now but I have some LTC and other alts tucked away.
This is a pretty stress free way of accumulating over time since it's not much money at all per week so if I make a mistake I dont lose much.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:52:48
Why?  There is only a set amount of money in this world and nowadays if you ask someone about bitcoin chances are they will have an idea of what it is.  
Obviously I wish we could just continue the same market cycles and we go to 1 million, but I don't think that's really possible.  .1 btc simply won't make anyone rich.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:47:21
100% a lambo for the memes.  who needs a basement anyways
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:06:37
This is nice
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:06:42
The BitPay wallet app can do that for you.
