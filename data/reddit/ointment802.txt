Wish I knew about bitcoin 5 years ago.  Started watching it 3 years ago and laughed when it got to be the price of an ounce of gold.

I was hoping to get a chuckle from the Chinese proverb.  You fired back a “we’ll see” when it dropped.  I’m glad you nailed your trade.  This is 100% a gamble.  Might as well be at a blackjack table.  In five years I’ll either feel great about this gut feeling or will be proven to be an idiot.  The current stock market seems far more unsustainable than bitcoin.  When that starts to implode the money will have to flow elsewhere.  It’s long over due for a huge correction.  I can afford to lose every dime that’s invested.  It would sting but it’s cash.  Not buying with credit cards or second mortgages like a lot of folks on this sub.  I am an idiot but risk is fun.

If it drops to $8500 you win and I become a buyer again.  Everybody wins!

You can trade GBTC.  It moves with the price of bitcoin. Hope you don’t have a weak stomach.  Pretty sure you’re supposed to buy actual bitcoin and then forget you bought it for a few years.

Appears to be going in your intended direction.  Good work, for now.  Ever seen “Charlie Wilson’s War”?  
To make the point, he tells the story of a Zen master who observes the people of his village celebrating a young boy's new horse as a wonderful gift. "We'll see," the Zen master says. When the boy falls off the horse and breaks a leg, everyone says the horse is a curse. "We'll see," says the master. Then war breaks out, the boy cannot be conscripted because of his injury, and everyone now says the horse was a fortunate gift. "We'll see," the master says again.

If it drops 800 points suddenly and then stays flat for a few days the chart will look like Bart’s head
