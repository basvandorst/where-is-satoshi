So the point, mentioned below is that the 18,800 is inflation adjusted income.  Presumably the $956 is not inflation adjusted. and it would be roughly: $10,802.80.  So if we're looking at home prices, which is the example you use, then housing has in fact gotten much, much more expensive.   I mean, anyone whose been alive long enough knows that is true since the 80s.
Now, yes real median income has grown a lot since the 1940s (again 1 year after the great depression).  But compare this chart:
with this one:
The first shows that we're about 10% higher in wages since 1980 (and roughly equal to 1999).  Now in the second one, look at the US line (green).  Housing prices are about 3x as expensive.  
Edit: Also notice, that the income / house prices in 1940 is around %~55 vs the %~38 in 2000.  
That said, this isn't apples and oranges but I just wanted to point out the example your using proves the opposite of what you mean.  However, other things (like food) I believe have gotten quite a bit cheaper and obviously houses come with nicer amenities these days (though I am living in one from 1938).

So, did you really choose a single year 1 year just after the great depression as somehow making a point?  I'm not saying your wrong but probably not the best year to choose.

Also, the chart you cite, already adjusted for inflation.  So, you adjusted twice.
