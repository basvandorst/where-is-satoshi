exactly my point. 
No body is interested in me. So my personal info doesn't matter.
But many large HODLERS I know, have paper wallets made out of bitaddress.org 
And by knowing, who has created bitaddress.org will certainly help them sleep better.
And I see no reason, why he should be hiding, unless he has **some undisclosed reasons to hide...?**

But I see no reason why, pointbiz (creator of  should remain behind curtains? Any thoughts?

Let's not get personal here.
Not everyone is tech savy and can verify the code via public-private key cryptography, do a sha256sum......
A real human face, will do wonders to the trust factor, which is VERY MUCH REQUIRED.
Ex: Alan Reiner's cute face behind Armory helps a lot :-)
**pointbiz should think on this and come out in the open and accept our gratitude &amp; thanks.**

guys I know in India,  are not at all into Bitcoins. When I tell them how revolutionary a technology this is, if at all convinced, the max they buy is like 0.2 BTC    THE VOLUME THERE IS VERY LOW

Good argument.
If enough people wants to know (&gt;150), will love to post my picture :-)

Suddenly Bitcoin looks so fragile....
@_date: 2015-08-09 08:36:40
Scary stuff!!
This and other such pitfalls require a handly list for newbies, so submitted a new text post here [reddit!](

my belief.....they always have &amp; always will.

What concerns me is, the SLOPE with WHICH the TREND is NOSE DIVING.
IT IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOUR.

The screen of the ATM &amp; the hand over it, looks photoshopped to me.
Is it just me or is there anybody else, that thinks that?

It would be REALLY helpful for the Bitcoin community,
if we take the tag of "Bitcoin Jesus" away from him.
Hope somebody starts some sort of campaign for this....
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:11:54
At the very least, He should rather clarify to the noobs, HE IS NOT BITCOIN JESUS and there is NO SUCH THING

Brian, you forgot about margin trading... both + &amp; -
irresponsible statement at best, coming from the CEO of a 'possible Unicorn' in Bitcoinland.....
@_date: 2016-02-01 09:41:50
sorry i got emotional there. i don't deserve it. i have made some pretty bad choices.
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:18:12
It is important for a bit of clean up in Bitcoin community.
IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR SOMEONE TO BE GIVEN THE TAG OF BITCOIN JESUS,
WHO IS OBVIOUSLY AT THE VERY LEAST- TAINTED, if not JUDAS.
Noobs being added daily to Bitcoin, would not know he is NOT WORTH naming Bitcoin Jesus,
and might get pied pipe'd to DESTRUCTION.
If Gox'd again, NEVER to RETURN AGAIN to Bitcoin land.

Pay rent for my family. That fat ass Karpeles, really brought me to tears...
@_date: 2016-02-01 09:49:33
$18k. pretty much my savings. anyways...i am working to turn things around.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:49:59
any other strategy you think is great? not everybody likes/afford to use a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:49:18
why are popular wallets liek electrum not ready with segwit YET?
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:29:39
Exactly. You don't feel the loss, because it was your friend.
And this was my loss with my money. And those funds were my life's savings.
Forget it, you will never get it.
Sleeping now. You can post more messages making fun of me. 
Will be able to answer only after I wake up.

Why would somebody boast about the excellence of BTC as an asset class, just before the auction?
What are you brewing Tim Darling..

The link tweet directs to is dated Feb 28? Can't understand??
This is no OFFICIAL announcement from a Government Official but a RANDOM point of view of some
RANDOM lawyer dude.
How can BTC China be so careless with tweets from there official account!!
**Not expected from a company managing $$$$MILLIONS $$$$ of dollars in trade**
Please think twice, before wiring money to a company in an alien land, who don't understand your language &amp; are this careless. This might just be a sign!
We need some serious players in the exchange business. Good to see Barry Silbert's BIT, Coinbase making things more professional.
Call me paranoid. I won't mind. 
One fat ass has already looted a significant portion of my life's saving (was GOXd $25K by that *****beep***) and I really don't want any other fat ass to play with life of any other investor.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:01:27
posted the reason in the post. Sorry but after the loss, I m behaving strangely. It's my family only that is keeping me alive.
