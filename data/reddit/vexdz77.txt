Isn't bitcoin interest happening soon. 1 to 1 bitcoin for same amount new Bitcoin interest? If it's gonna split into 2 and wall street gets bonuses and wants to invest or maybe exchanges want people to sell so they are holding more bitcoins and will own the new coin...

Going to treat addiction with a app and a cryptocurrency. Money has been found to help people addicted to opiets get clean and stop using as much as methadone.
The war on drugs is a fool's errand. I can save money by paying for a behavior rather than talk about what you should do. Getting clean in the real.world.takes money. 30k.for a.month of rehab then homeless. Why not take 10 k.and pay for looking for a job. Transportation.  Rent. Food..
 Posting recovery related content like a kiva.org app or steemit.io app. Condition behavior with financial incentives. I have peer reviewed journal and lots of research
 I think I can change the world by showing that people cant just fulfill their responsibies with asking for help. They need money and to get money they will have to do tasks that are meant to change their minds by education or being responsible. ...

I have given a 100 dollar bill along with a buy order and password n keys to seed a online wallet.  I keep a copy of these of course. Then since the date of the buy order it has increased in value now the newbie has been enlightened and sees that storing value in cash has cost them money they ask me to invest the 100 bill into the online wallet and then make money from referral. I get to control the flow of money until they take control of the online wallet and then they have the knowledge that i have had to learn the hard way. I believe in Metcalf law for value of network and I have no problem if a newbie can help me with spreading the word.

The systems that provide ability to keep value in a economy must protect itself from individuals benefiting from market forces so much so it destroys the system and nobody wins.  The losers today are more likely the winners of the next big boom.  If the halting of trading protects holders from having so much gain that all the losers stop playing then it doesn't matter who one the competition because the game has no future.

I have this same view. This is technology that lifts people up. Whining and crying and playing a victim is only hurting the small guys from fully benefiting from the opportunity that is dangled in front of them making fear the only barrier to financial liberation. The ease of entry and free valuable tokens will mean that any financial catastrophe is not the sentence of a life in poverty. You just get up again  if it fails do it again. The more despair the greater the opportunity to find the solution.  The only thing to fear is fear itself.

Our bitcoins and I say our bitcoin can only appreciate in value monetarily if the social value continues to grow through expansion of our network.  The more people accepting bitcoin as a transaction strengthens the entire ecosystem of which our wealth can manifest itself to get what we want done. So by spending bitcoin to nourish whatever need you have in a way that brings in new participants to the market is not only a economically positive action it is the closest thing to a god like act giving a uninitiated individual the opportunity to share and grow from participating on the blockchain that gives us our combined strength.

Treat it like property irs has a webstite irs.gov. i think you should just take out a loan. No tax implications and you still own your coin. Lender will liquidate coins to repay principle at end of loan.  Basically pawning your bitcoin and only liable to pay back principle with interest if you cant refinance again. The beuty of bitcoin is that its liquity and ability to be broken down into parts means its more valuable than anything else.

Easy dont sell. Borrow say $2 IN BITCOIN to 1 in fiat. Logic no taxes if you dont pay cash back borrow more.  If bitcoin keeps rising you can borrow indefinitely. If it clasped you took a loss and thats the lenders problem. Now a better idea is to open up a trading desk operation.  Look eventually access to fiat will be easier.  In the meantime dont spend the coin. If u cant pay the loan back then u only lose  the coins u used as collateral and if it goes up you can borrow more.

Look come up with a ico.  Sell the tokens to the political parties for the campaign ads. Set up a reddit or steem system that pays you in the tokens for content. The community can downvote the crazys so they wont get paid for divisive hateful rhetoric. And take the funds create a app that gps will tell if u were within x feetof voting and you can get a voting bounty from the candidate you support or pays the best.  EVENTIALY blochain voting will be the norm. And every soveirn will have to buy the app for there election.  After 2016 spent 2billion in the elections imagine if a cimmunity could make sure it was spent on real debate creating social value inatead of it digressing into a whining match.

This is how i see bitcoin. If you understand that it is a boom bust high volatility game you win. If you understand that every 4 years it will halve and its value will increase and statablizes you win. You lose if you walk away or hold indefinitely.  Its a investment vehicle that allows a small investment to reward holding it. If you after 5 years of holding it arent diversified into the same amount of fixed income assets or property that will provide you with passive income to live day to day or ivest elsewhere you miss the point. Buy in and sell high and never sell low. Sell into other cryptos that you will hold hoping 1 out of 10 or out of 100 will make you money.  As we get older it is harder to recover when the market goesdown.  Investing wisely is key to mental health.  Live like a peasant for now but make sure you increase your consumption at a healthy growth rate or you will  forever be at the mercy of the markets.

Look bitcoin needs fiat and govrenment needs the will of the people to enforce the laws that give fiat(contracts) there force. Bitcoin is in essence the will of the people in karnate.  Its an abstract concept quantified and given a value based on fiat to give it a universally agreed on value.  I am not a fan of government or laws i believe they stifen  creativity and cause a lot of harm.  However unrestrained activism can lead to the same problems we task government to solve.  When fiat cant create bitcoin will.  If there is a demand for a solution then the free market will step in and without government fiat create solutions that reward the party in need and the party that fills that need with little waste of capital or manpower.  Its liquidity is what gives it strenght and worth drawn from the value people in the network assign to it.  If a government wants the networks support than they will treat bitcoin as a partner in capitalism and so long as individuals use bitcoins to do what for so long was a prayer or ask god event than the world is a better place regardless of if on paper somethings illegal or legal.  Time is the only scarce resource.  It is better to do and ask forgiveness than to wait to take action until it is to late.  For far more damage will come from setting up systems that give you permission to do what is needed.  Success or failure will be determined by markets and liberated individuals not bound by the chains of governments  approval.  If a action is in the governments best interest they must reward it possibly by allowing that solution to be able to be exchanged for fiat there own bitcoin as the 2 are created for the same purpose. To provide incentive for the survival of our species.  To bring humans together in the most efficient manner that has longterm ans short term benefits.  If a nation will see that bitcoin is the solution that makes it resposible for only protecting its bourders and citizens from hostile  groyps that seek to destroy it and focus on real threats and place its citizens sovereignty ahead of the  needs of a few than the world can create heaven on earth.  Never make a deal with the devil

Had enough for several thousand. I did lose interest as it was boring in the beggining. Nobody understands. This has turned into a addiction.  Im insane... im thinking in circles.  I guess i had gotten used to not thinking about it.  My girlfriend  cant talk to me i really dont want to make plans with her.  I stopped working cause i hated thinking in terms of money just made me nutty.  I Had just gotten comfortable.  Anyway thank you for the ear.

No real estate backed by pawning of your bitcoin and let the lender repay the loan by liquidating satoshies to avoid tax implications. Use the passive rental income to buy those mutual funds and equity then since you now can tokenize assets you demand payment in your companies market token thus lifting the renters up into the bitcoin ether economy.  Tax is the index of a societies wastefullness.  The rich are efficient and the poor are by no fault other than happenstance inherently wasteful. The middleclass is government. The rich need government to protect assets the middle class needs the rich to support them and the poor needs government to provide the tools to become productive members of society. Tax is how the rich pays for the needed protection  from the wastefullness of poverty.  The middle-class if they cannot provide protection by creating jobs must use force.  Proper use of capital lessens the need for force. Because its the fear of force that creates lack of mobility and compliance.  No free lunch but all must eat in order to have order so we can raise our young in a stable home.  As inflation rises productivity and efficiency increase and soon individuals wont have to work as much or for as long so they wont require job security. Its rhe fear of losing that security that inspires us to do better and to do harm to repel those who seek to replace us. Its Masonic 101.

The middle class is slaves.  The poor are free and the rich are poor. Poor are free because they dont cary the chains of possession. Rich are slaves because they must always protect against wasting the precious resource. Middle class will learn that you have to live small so you can enjoy happiness and freedom.
