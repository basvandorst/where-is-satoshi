What happens if you send btc to an address that isn't owned by anyone?

So every two years you need to buy a new one?

My guess is that their database ran out of disk space.

My personal use case is that my bank is ripping me off, I have to pay $70 a year just to have an account... and an extra $200 a year if I want to have a credit card.  I live in Europe and I don't think we have those "credit unions" everyone speaks off when this issue comes up.

Ok, this is what I found:
There is a hidden div in the code, you can make it appear with the following code on your browser console.
     $("
     $(" .operator").html("testing").show()
     $(" .text").html("test").show()
  
Apparently this data will come from a web sockets end point, there is also a mini-game hidden and background music that is supposed to trigger at some point.  
**Update**: add *?preview* at the end of the url to trigger the music and rocket animation. Like this: 
**Update 2**: they just patched the *?preview* thing, apparently it was not supposed to be there :)
In addition, there is a hidden button that says "just a little longer", if you wanna see it type this code into your browser dev console and hit enter:
     p = function() {
        clearInterval(move_rocket_interval),         $(".rocket").addClass("landed"), $(".line").fadeOut(), $.post("/lunar/click", {
              dataType: "script"
           })
        };
     p()
   
To open the Console tab in chrome, do the following:
Use the keyboard shortcut -&gt; Command + Option + J (Mac) or Control + Shift + J (Windows/Linux).

How do you trigger the pusher messages? I disabled adblock and still can't see them.

If you get paid in btc you can get enough for your daily spending, I know very little ppl do atm, but you can do freelancing and only take btc as payment.

What kind of bad troll is this? What do you think 40%+ of all the servers on the internet are running? Don't compare apple to oranges, seriously. Also Linux has been out for over 20 years and has backing by pretty much every major IT company: intel, cisco, IBM, samsung, google...

I believe the 2 at the end is for Segwit &amp; the 1 for BIP91.
