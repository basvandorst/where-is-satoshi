There is adds and article about crypto everywhere, I do not think people should enter to crypto via project like ripple or bcash. 
Also I do not think that it efficient to enter people to crypto for free tokens. People should participate in lectures or e learning  course and by Bitcoin because they understand what problem it solves and what it is stand for  
Bitcoin is cypherpunk.

Unbelievable you are in R/ bitcoin this is not R/Crypto here. 
B cash is hard fork, a group of people that decided to go after the money of bitmain an Gihan and leave the community they have centralize leadership and they do not care about consensus

1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin

It’s no meter the value in fiat. 1 bitcoin is one bitcoin. Like 1 kg of gold is one kg of gold. Fiat will be equal to 0 in the future so it is no relevant

I think donate to scaling bitcoin organization and not just the project itself is aligned with the donators goal. Scaling bitcoin is the torch who help these project get the stage and light they need and it’s non for profit. If you will donate this you will be able to have impact on many other projects

Sure, but I saw bad reviews on this wallet

Basically I plan the app to have basic 10 tasks ordered by difficulty level and then open it to the community to add more tasks  so user will be able to practice lots of situations form basics to advanced usages - multisig, protection against hackers and so..

For example this [Linda course]( has almost 20K views and practical tutorials on how to use bitcoin with list of tasks the student actually supposed to commit on his bitcoin wallet
