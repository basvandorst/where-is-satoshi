So, if one cannot determine who is actually the end-user behind an IP number, then how would that function? AS you see, court judges have stated, "There is nothing that links the IP address location to the identity of the person actually downloading and viewing Plaintiff’s videos"

Actually, as money is generated at will, taxes for revenue is obsolete
Federal taxes can be made to serve four principal purposes of a social and economic character. These purposes are:
1. As an instrument of fiscal policy to help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar;
2. To express public policy in the distribution of wealth and of income, as in the case of the progressive income and estate taxes;
3. To express public policy in subsidizing or in penalizing various industries and economic groups;
4. To isolate and assess directly the costs of certain national benefits, such as highways and social security.

The important thing to recognize you have two notes, a series '28 and a series '34.
By definition, a "note" is a promise to pay. You sign a mortgage note, stating your promise and ability to pay a bank and in turn you are allowed to live in a home, so long as you make payments with interest.
Anyways, notice the difference between the two series.
Series 28 states, "Redeemable in gold on demand at the United States Treasury, or in gold or lawful money at any Federal Reserve Bank"
Series 34 wording is slightly different, but still mentions lawful money, meaning Gold. 
Now, the U.S. currency don't even mention that, the paper is just legal tender with no backing otherwise known as fiat currency. See how we were hoodwinked?

IRS notices are not law. In fact, following IRS notices and publications are done so at you own peril! 
Please define this "lifestyle audit" per the IRC you mention.

So if someone wins a lottery for $25M they get trumped up on AML laws? 
Face it, you have no clue what you are talking about.
[Most recently, the courts have reminded us that IRS’s published guidance is not law (Bobrow, TC Memo. 2014-21). Tax Court Judge Joseph W. Nega went as far as to state that the IRS’ published guidance “is not binding precedent” and that “taxpayers rely on IRS guidance at their own peril.”](

SInce when is mowing one's lawn for a few coins a commercial endeavor? As an individual has a right to free trade, then FinCEN definitions do not apply.
States and Government regulations typically apply to one when in operation of commerce, mowing ones lawn for coins does not convey commerce. 
On an individual level, Bitcoin does not need regulations, licenses or oversight by Government. The Internet got along fine without such, so will Bitcoin.

There was a questionnaire floating around on Reddit I think on what the price of Bitcoin would be in middle 2015. 
After watching  and reading about The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki, I did some simple math from all the guesses. Adding the ~200+ guesses together and dividing by the quantity of guesses I derived a figure of ~$2500/coin. 
Now, I am no way advocating that Bitcoin will meet this value but the math behind and theory as to the reasoning is solid nonetheless.
We shall see.

Same thing could be said about credit/debit cards. *shrug*
Almost none of the businesses mentioned above technically accept credit cards. Instead, they partner with a middleman—generally either Amex or Visa—who takes a customer’s card, immediately converts it into cash, and then deposits the cash in the company’s bank account.

Another one, that doesn't answer questions relevant to the discussion. 
When one questions the entire issue, taxes and bitcoins, no one provides anything substantial to back up their claims. 


So as this comment was posted, the entire idea "fantasy" is that the IRS somehow tracks Bitcoins, even though others have stated they don't and they do not care. But it is up to the user to "tattle" on themselves, as the burden of proof is on them.

Its about the service that Bitcoin provides that is the most important thing, price is secondary.
Example: I use to get bad letters from Comcast saying I was downloading movies. However, since I started using a VPN service and paying them in Bitcoin. The letters have gone away.
Having dismissed Bitcoin originally, I missed out on a mega-opportunity being liquid with 6-figures in June of 2013, then I rediscovered Bitcoin end of that year I bought my very first coin in March 2014 for ~$500.
After that time, I have sunk in perhaps 1% of my worth in bitcoin and expected it to drop overtime before it caught-on... long term thinking takes a long-time to transpire. 
I offer this text:
You take a little seed, plant it, water it, and fertilize it for a whole year, and nothing happens. 
The second year you water it and fertilize it, and nothing happens. 
The third year you water it and fertilize it, and nothing happens. How discouraging this becomes! 
The fifth year you continue to water and fertilize the seed and then---take note. Sometime during the fifth year, the Chinese bamboo tree sprouts and grows NINETY FEET IN SIX WEEKS! 
Life is much akin to the growing process of the Chinese bamboo tree. 
It is often discouraging. We seemingly do things right, and nothing happens. But for those who do things right and are not discouraged and are persistent, things will happen. Finally we begin to receive the rewards. 
I am now receiving the rewards of seeds that were planted 5 years ago. You are as well. Are you getting the results you want? If not, begin today to sow the seeds of what you want 5 years from now. 
Remember, if you keep doing what you've always done, you'll get the results you've always gotten.

Your statement is a non-sequitur.

It cannot be all three items, so to break it down, you have:
1. Doesn't know.
2. Doesn't care.
3. Knows and request's information. 
Ignoring items one and two, lets focus on item three. 
- How would the IRS know what amount of Bitcoins have been transferred? 
- How does the IRS assign a liability to a Bitcoin user? 
- Per IRC regulations, please explain to me how this transpires.
- Sans an identifying SSN/TIN, how does the IRS assess an individual for using Bitcoins.

According to some dimwits on this reddit, there are some that have repeatedly told me that you can be tracked by the IRS and subsequently made to own some sort of tax for spending/buying bitcoins.
Obviously, perhaps this is the reason the person wants to stay anonymous.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:11:28
Taxes should be of no concern with Bitcoin.

I downloaded it, then played with setting up a fake page. Shut it down, the restarted it and now its stuck at trying to reconnect to my server? Even a reinstall with --purge gives me the same thing. There were some other issues as well, but I never got a chance to write them down. Dead in the water here.

Good question.
Considering that you should be pricing yourself out for profit, then 1/3 should be enough to cover you basic costs for materials etc..  But if the buyer does not pay they don't get the work!
Even if transactions occur with bitcoins, I would prefer a signed contract, letter of credit, etc..

For the second time, I asked you for IRC regulations, stating this self-reporting on Bitcoins. If you cannot produce this, then no one is going to take you seriously.
And on breaking the law.. I find it "morally reprehensible" that you are telling people how to act, and when I call you out on your bullshit and request that you quote the statutory limitations "the LAW",  you rather go and attack my character.

Of course Coinbase does NOT have the coins it says it does. I am willing to bet that they operate just like a bank, whereby they only retain a 10% reserve.

Imagine eBay doing this in the beginning. Sorry, our system is designed for your safety, you will receive a refund in 3-4 days. 
For that matter, I do not see any of the major credit card providers doing this either.
Reading the Coinbase user agreement, section 3.1.3. 
"Coinbase processes Bitcoin Transactions according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Coinbase as the relevant Bitcoin Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated."
However, THEY can and DO cancel orders!

Matter of fact? LOL... Your argument is "Buying a little (BITCOIN) at a time is a felony called structuring".
I asked you very directions questions, of which have not responded to and referred me to USE Google. With that being said, I will respond for you:
 There is no law.
 See above
 Bitcoins are not legally defined as currency, so they are exclusive and not regulated.
 As in  Bitcoins are not currency and are not regulated.
Furthermore, since you are incapable of an appropriate response backing up your mouth, I will post information clearly showing how silly your argument is.
31 CFR 103.11(gg) - Structure (structuring). For purposes of section 103.53, a person structures a transaction if that person, acting alone, or in conjunction with, or on behalf of, other persons, conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions in currency, in any amount, at one or more financial institutions, on one or more days, in any manner, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements under section 103.22 of this part. “In any manner” includes, but is not limited to, the breaking down of a single sum of currency exceeding $10,000 into smaller sums, including sums at or below $10,000, or the conduct of a transaction, or series of currency transactions, including transactions at or below $10,000. The transaction or transactions need not exceed the $10,000 reporting threshold at any single financial institution on any single day in order to constitute structuring within the meaning of this definition.
31 CFR 1010.100(m) - Currency. The coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender and that circulates and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance. Currency includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes and Federal Reserve notes. Currency also includes official foreign bank notes that are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in a foreign country.
So, to reiterate, Bitcoin is NOT U.S. currency and is NOT legal tender, is not regulated and has nothing to do with structuring, as defined above.

Can math be hacked... hmmmmm.. How does one hack an equation, in its most simplest form?
Lets see: 
**Pythagorean Theorems a2 + b2 = c2**
*The Pythagorean Theorem takes place in a right triangle. The longest side in a right triangle is called hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called legs. The hypotenuse opposes the right angle.*
*According to the Pythagorean Theorem:  A squared + B squared = C squared*
*The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most important theorems in geometry. You can use it to find the unknown side in a right triangle, and to find the distance between two points.*
One could pick any of 17 equations that changed the world:  and try to "hack" them to no avail. Although, hacking gravity would be awesome.
Anyways, Bitcoins are mined using a cryptographic algorithm called SHA-256. Here is an example of someone doing the math by hand:
