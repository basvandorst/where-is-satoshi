Black market price is about 950 USD. The best I can say it's possible without major trickery is 1090 USD (which is just loading the money in a credit card and spending it outside the country, taking the 35% tax hit).
If you are returning to a foreign country, I am not sure what tricks are still working to get the official exchange rate. A popular one was buying casino chips and cashing them in, but that was blocked by a recent law.

Thanks. I'm really hoping I can use BTC to leave the country before things get any worse.

The most likely outcome of business operating in Bitcoin is **massive** taxes and penalties for trying to "circumvent the exchange rate". This excuse has already been used for draconian measures before. When it comes to commerce, the government's stance is "our way or the highway".

I feel I should give proof that what I am saying is true, since some people already sent me bitcointips based on just my word... so here's a picture of my passport and local ID, with my profile page in the background, displaying my current BTC balance (which includes the bitcointips), and a random QRCode from my Electrum.

Unfortunately, yes. I keep hoping that the government will realize how much they're harming the economy and stop it, but it never happens.

Thank you. I am looking into leaving the country to be honest. It's likely that Bitcoin will be the only assets I have that I will be able to sell for a foreign currency in order to be able to leave. I honestly should have seen the writing on the wall in 2011 when buying dollars was made extremely difficult to the point of being a ban for practical purposes; I kept waiting for things to get better, and now the feeling is honestly claustrophobic.
If you visit, you'll probably get an extremely good price for it. I have been looking at Local Bitcoins and if you go with the official exchange rate, one Bitcoin is selling for 1408 US Dollar.

I need to get it out of the bank first, but yes. It's sad, but converting to Bitcoin at a really expensive rate is better than keeping it in the local currency.

"Plazo fijo", the money was deposited under a contract that doesn't let me extract it for 6 months, but with "very good" interest rates. It's the encouraged legal way to maintain savings, rather than illegal transactions like buying USD in the black market. You _can_ cancel it, but the penalties and fees are draconian, and it still takes time to go through, so it's a lose-lose situation.
The "very good" interest rates were barely keeping up with inflation last year, and the current peak just negated them completely. My savings are now worth less than what I deposited.
Mind you, we're not talking about huge savings here, from an international perspective - I have about 50,000 ARS, which when the plazo fijo was last renewed were worth $8620 USD. That same amount is now worth $6250 at official rates, but it's practically impossible to buy USD at that rate. The black market rate for the dollar puts my savings at $3846 USD.
Those savings are the results of many, many years of work. Watching their value plummet like that is... honestly depressing. When I opened that account it was with the goal of buying my own house someday. That's most definitely not happening now.

Thank you. I hope so too.

The public doesn't get distracted by the Falklands and hasn't for years. The fact that they keep trying to push Falklands bullshit as if it would still work is proof of the insane disconnect between the people and the government.

I took a picture of the pesos I have on my wallet, so you can see the worthless paper on all its glory and updated the OP with it.

I lived through three periods of inflation.
The first one, I was a kid, and I remember my parents one day giving me a large box full of bills. That was all their savings, which had been rendered worthless in a couple of weeks. The routine was to go to the market on payday and buy as many canned goods and food that wouldn't expire quickly and store it, because next week you wouldn't be able to buy one piece of candy with the entire salary.
During my teenage years the peso was pegged to the USD, and while I now know how damaging that is to the economy, at the time it was awesome. I started working at age 16 and I could buy my own computer within a few months, without worrying about the money becoming worthless! So when the crisis began in 2001, I was naive and figured that it wouldn't get so bad.
After the riots, the peso pretty much immediately lost 66% of its value. from 1 peso = 1 USD to 3 peso = 1 USD. It was one big smack in the face, but I was in my early 20s so I didn't have large savings to lose. I figured things would stabilize and we'd have a normal inflation.
And for a while it was true, but the problem is that we ended up being an example of putting a frog in cold water and then slowly rising the temperature until the frog is cooked. The inflation accelerated slightly but surely. One kilogram of bread went from 1 ARS to 2 to 3 to 4 to 6... it was definitely noticeable, but slow enough that you almost could believe it was in control, because you really, really don't want to think what happens if it goes out of control.
I think that remembering the hyperinflation of the late 80s played against me here, because I kept thinking of those days and saying "at least it's not as bad as then". But it is bad. I lead a rather frugal lifestyle because I was trying to save to become a homeowner, but each month it was less and less than I could save, and now my savings are losing value just by sitting there. I don't know if things will get as bad as when I was a kid, but they have reached a point where they don't need to be. If I can't keep up with the cost of living, it doesn't matter if the inflation is 25% anually or daily.
An example via something I don't consider a "necessity": my computer. I used to upgrade it pretty often, since the parts were affordable. In late 2012, things turned backwards: buying parts that were **worse** than what I had started costing **more**. I see listings on MercadoLibre (our local version of eBay) for my 3 year old Radeon HD 5770 and they're asking for more than I originally paid for it new. When my 2TB hard drive died last year, I ended up buying a 1TB one to replace it and paying more than I had paid for 2x 2TB drives in 2011.
Things that you don't need to buy constantly are the best indicators, because you actually feel the price increase between sales. Food and such is increasing in price all the time, but because you buy it constantly, you only see the small increases.
