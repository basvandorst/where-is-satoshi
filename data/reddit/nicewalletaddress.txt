Vanity address is interesting for people who want an interesting address especially for receiving bitcoins, where security is the same as any other random bitcoin address.

Of course, everyone has the opportunity to find a vanity address himself. But not everyone wants to spend time studying theory about how to do it or spend a lot of money on high-performance hardware to find a vanity address with many custom characters and then wait for the results in a few days, weeks or months. For example, it's like someone hiring a programmer because he doesn't want to learn programming.

A split-key address is a type of address generated from one or more ECDSA private keys. The general use case is when a user generates a key-pair and only shares his public key. Everybody can use this public key to find the complementary public key leading to a vanity address. The user can than merge his private key with the complementary private key, leading to the private key of the custom vanity address. The security of such solution is guaranteed by the properties of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The only one who knows the private key to custom vanity address is the user, no one else.
