In this example maybe, but the entire premise of the website is basically you steal credit cards and buy shit and we'll send you bitcoins.  


Honestly and truthfully, do you not think this "business" is a front for carders?  This is exactly the same situation that purse.io user just got his house raided by the police for.  Now introduce utilities and other stuff, and we're bound to see credit report markings, collection agencies when it's discovered buyer used stolen credit card, and all sorts of fun stuff.  This is completely ridiculous on every level. 
This site along with purse.io will be gone by this time next year after having profited off theft.

Yup, but with each increase comes increased bandwidth usage, increased disk space, and increased block size.  This further centralizes mining, and you have to convince majority of the network that increasing block size is a good idea.  Possible?  Sure.  Would I bet my life savings on this happening? Nope.

You can get away with a lot of bitcoin criticism lately, it seems they're becoming slightly more self-aware.  Hell, they gave you 5 upvotes for your above comment, I think that might be a record for your handle.
Edit: It's even more pathetic when you consider how this business came about accepting bitcoin. I bet these guys literally begged the restaurant to accept their bitcoins or they'd have the meetup elsewhere. The owner reluctantly agreed just to get a quick $500 from them. Fast forward a few months from now and they will have processed maybe 1-2 more bitcoin transactions and then stop accepting it.

You must be retarded, because you fail to comprehend even the most basic conversations in every thread.  Bitcoin is so obscure there are only 1 tps at the moment.  If by some miracle more people started using bitcoin and it required a steady stream of 3 tps, it could not handle it.  Period.  3 TPS is more than bitcoin can handle.
It's the equivalent of a car maker selling you a car with a max speed of 300 MPH, with the only catch being it requires a fuel that only exists in one country, a class of tires that won't exist till 2030, a type of road surface that is only used on race tracks, and the backseat, speakers, and passenger seat must be removed from the car to reduce its overall weight.  It's a joke, and a patently untrue claim.
Bitcoin, under no real world scenario can handle 7 TPS, or anything remotely even close to 7 TPS without a hard fork. 
You have been lied to, and you don't care.

It doubled because there was a bubble at the end of 2013.  As soon as that bubble ended, the number of interested people in bitcoin has been declining across every single bitcoin website.

If you're using transaction numbers as a metric for user adoption then then mixers are fake transactions. One user creating dozens or hundreds of transactions for a single purchase would be considered artificial.


So if I own a hotel and my friend rents 9 out of 10 floors from me every month, is my hotel a success?  Should a potential buyer of the hotel know that 90% of the hotel's business is one person?


It certainly is, most of these transactions are tucked in 1 or two blocks, they happen very quickly.  Like I said in another comment if this was a legit transaction it would use a single transaction with multiple outputs.
Next ask yourself if you want to be involved in a system that's designed around manipulation.  Be it exchanges or regular users, nothing in bitcoin is as it seems.  Nothing.

* Bitcoin is not cheaper than WU or money gram.  Sure it can send money for free, but sender has to convert fiat -&gt; bitcoin and receiver has to convert bitcoin -&gt; fiat
* Card theft can be solved with chip and pin like every other country except the U.S  Additionally 1 out of 16 bitcoins in possession are stolen so his claim is literally a joke 
* Near zero transaction fee is not forever, and possibly not even sustainable after the next block halving
* Avoid monopoly?  Bitcoin has a worse wealth inequality than even 3rd world dictatorships, it's like 1000x worse than USD.  Satoshi has 1/15th of the currency monetary supply!  That doesn't even include all the other early adopters.

I don't devote any energy to its demise, I focus my energy at poking fun at the user base.  I couldn't care less whether bitcoin succeeds or does not succeed.  If it was going to take off, I think it would have already.  If it was going to take off, I would expect to see worth while apps developed for it already, and I see none.  I see absolutely nothing that convinces me bitcoin is about to go mainstream.  Literally, nothing.  You can sit there and say VC this, Microsoft that, but really it means nothing to me.  Until I see an app that makes me go "wow, that's cool but first I need to buy some btc to use it", bitcoin is going nowhere.  To bet your life savings on bitcoin in hopes of one day being the next Jimmy Buffet is hopelessly delusional. 
All I see is a quite literally evil community surrounding a novelty technology.  I see an entire community shouting at the top of their lungs "moon" while pitching a MLM/Pyramid/Ponzi/Pump and Dump/whatever you want to call it.  I see an entire community whose sole purpose is spamming, "marketing", or tricking their family and friends that this is some revolutionary technology.  I see people "investing" their entire life savings, taking out cash advances, and even asking loan sharks - all to lose it all.  I see hardcore gamblers, hard core con man, and hard core thieves.  
You can waltz around casually comparing bitcoin to the internet, that's fine.  Anyone who thinks about it sees the flaws in your arguments.  Nobody begged people to use the internet.  Nobody begged people to use email.  And nobody begged people to sign up for paypal.  People just did it because it was useful.  Ask yourself, if bitcoin is such a hot technology, why does the user base have to rely on jehovah witness style begging to find new people to keep the pyramid from collapsing?

Either I have so much money in my Paypal account that I have never noticed that, or my account is grand fathered in and the funds are available right away.  I have my bank and CC linked to Paypal, so maybe that makes a difference if the funds can be spent right away.  As far as I can tell my balance increases instantly with every payment (whether or not that's spendable idk) Even so your argument only makes sense when merchant adoption is so saturated that bitcoins are accepted everywhere credit cards are.  If they aren't accepted I would have to go through an exchange or circle/coinbase type site and get fiat - which again takes days.  Please don't say use localbitcoins in response.


I'm 50/50, I think some form of crypto currency will have a role in the future but I just don't see that being bitcoin.  Not many technologies go mainstream on their first implementation. 
I am absolutely not convinced it can scale, especially while remaining decentralized.  Every time you scale the protocol up you increase the likelyhood of centralization.  You may be able to rely on Moores Law for hard drive space, but certainly not bandwidth.  Bandwidth is abysmal in the United States and many parts of the world, and eventually you're going to need serious pipes to run a node.  Right now each block is a half meg almost for 1 TPS, scale that to 2,000 TPS and you've got yourself some serious bandwidth constraints.  Until the technology comes out to solve these problems I remain a skeptic, because there's a shit fuck ton wrong with bitcoin scalability to just keep brushing it under the rug with promise of sidechains and other potential vaporware.
Then there's the fact that an exponentially deflationary currency is retarded IMO.  Right now the miners create retarded inflation rates that's clearly crashing the entire economy right now.  Once block halves what then?  Mining crashes?  Transaction fees?  Should have made it linear inflation for life at a sustainable rate.

This subreddit is 1 part and 1 part with some bitcoin related news thrown in.  It makes for spectacular delusions on an epic scale though.  This article is highly upvoted because despite all evidence to the contrary, these people actually genuinely believe people will go run out and buy bitcoin when their fiat currency is collapsing. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:45:54
So which part about extensive A/B testing do you not understand?  These companies pay large amounts of money to test everything about their forms to see which has the highest ROI.  
But again, you proclaim to know better than Wikipedia who likely spent 10s of thousands of dollars or more researching every miniscule detail about their order form, to get the most amount of money out of it!  The current form is perfect, it's what gets them the most money.  I don't see what's so hard to understand about that.  If they added or subtracted anything, it would amount to a net loss.  Simple as that.  
Besides, do they really care about the literal dozens of butt donations they will receive?  Of course not.  They deal with millions of $, the few thousand $s of bitcoin that will be generated is a statistical insignificance.  
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:32:10

Yes, banks charge fees.  You know what else they do?  Provide fraud protection.  Remember that time you lost all your bitcoins because you made a tiny security mistake?  Well if you were paying a small fee per transaction, that mistake would have been insured.  See how that works?  When bitcoin in another decade has most of the coins mined, it will charge a transaction fee.  And it still won't be insured.  Oops! 


Hey remember the remittance challenge where we asked for a single demonstrable instance where bitcoin was cheaper than Western Union, and the entire sub failed to provide even one example?  Yea I remember that one too.  Fun times!
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:24:23
I seriously have to question how much the average bitcoiner has even researched bitcoin.  Countless times have people pasted that to me as evidence transaction volume is rising, when that is the number of transactions, not the volume.  The volume is the amount of actual money bought and sold on a daily basis, the transaction link you posted is transactions per day by number.  Massive difference.  Transactions per day = rising, transaction volume = sideways.

Wouldn't need to spin it.  Would just need to look at the numbers a few months after its implemented.  Just like literally every other company that "accepts" bitcoin, sales figures don't lie.  I'm sure Overstock, who just reported [dismal sales figures]( for bitcoin is re-thinking their decision.  Mozilla could also tell you a little bit [about dwindling sales](  Or how about Bitpay, the self purported "best measure of the health of the bitcoin economy" which failed to process even 6,000 transactions on black friday?   
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:29:55
Assuming that transaction number per day keeps going at an exponential rate, you won't cap out the 7tps for another 5-7 years.  I'm highly skeptical of that metric as well because the transaction volume is the same place is was this time last year, meaning there's not much new money actually in circulation.  In addition to that, [all social metrics available show an obvious decline this year]( which makes me even that much more skeptical about that transaction number.


It's not really an opinion, the only thing right now bitcoin can't do that fiat can't is by drugs anonymously.  You can deny it all you want, but the killer app for bitcoin is darknet markets.

The Reuters article recently stated there were between 250-500k addresses with bitcoin.  As you said, many users have multiple address, I mayself have at least 3-5 active at any time.  This puts the number of users for a 5 year old tech at a shockingly low amount.


That's exactly what I am telling you.  The surge from $150-$1000 required a $10 billion market cap.  Guess what a surge to $10,000 would require the market cap to be this time? ~$180 billion.  As mentioned above, bitcoin is tiny, and I'm not seeing that happen.  Media exposure has already given limelight to anyone who's intellectually curious about bitcoin, another surge will not have the same effects.  The initial surge drew every get rich quicker into the game, where's the next round of users going to come from?  


They have pumped money into: Payment processors, exchanges, mining, and other financial institutions.  They have not pumped money into: innovative ideas, killer apps, anything revolutionary.  


These companies are just taking advantage of the fact that early adopters need a way to cash out their bitcoin without paying taxes.  Simple as that.  Additionally, none of the above actually accept bitcoins, and on top of that, at least two companies on that list have backed failed internet currencies in their history.  None of those companies cause user adoption and that is what bitcoin needs.  It will not get it until it gets a killer app.


Finally a point we can agree on!

Meh nobody knows what will happen but if you want my best guess I'll say between $100-200, I don't think it will ever get to double digits simply because it will be continued to be used on darknet markets.  And it will be speculated on for many years to come which will also keep the price up.  I have a hunch that we still have some dropping to do and sometime next year we'll see some mid 200 prices, maybe lower, who knows.  I think quad digits is unlikely in the short or mid term, maybe 10+ years, but who knows if a better system won't exist by then.

Oh boy have I got some bad news for you then.  If you're comparing bitcoin to linux then it's safe to say that bitcoin = unix.  The first implementation, hardly used at all.  And while a small subset of servers use it, you may even consider it a failure, as solid an OS as it is.
Or about about your internet example.  We can call the blockchain TCP/IP and bitcoin ARPANET, soon to be replaced by the internet we actually know today.
My favorite comparison is Segwey though:
* Lots of hype
* Touted as revolutionary
* Paradigm shift
* Lots of VC
* Complete flop
* Some obscure uses today, but not the major uses it was thought to have been created for

No it is not inevitable, and it definitely won't be bitcoin.  Bitcoin has no network effect as you say, because it has a couple hundred thousand global users.  Any successful technology will pick up that amount of people in the first year.  Bitcoin is used by nobody, has fatal flaws, and has a toxic reputation.

That's like saying if everyone in America donated $1 to me, I'd be rich.  So far only 10 people donated, so the potential for me to be rich is huge.  It makes no sense.  Last media hype got bitcoin (by your own admission) under 500,000 global users.  Even though hundreds of millions of people have heard of bitcoin it has gotten under a million users...


These "free" transactions come at the price of inflation of the currency at staggering rates.  Last numbers I saw each transaction was socialized by everyone to the tune of $10 or more per transaction (on top of each transaction omitting 104 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere, an amount that is simply MIND BLOWING, considering 25% of all transactions are completely fake to begin with).  Additionally, these free transactions won't last forever, and may even be implemented at the next halving.  Even if they aren't implemented then, it's a certainty they will be implemented within the next 1-2 decades simply because most of the coins will be mined.


Buzzwords.  My bank is more secure than bitcoin, insured by FDIC, and insured against fraud, phishing, or anything.  How many bitcoiners have to lose thousands of dollars via hacking before they realize being your own bank is retarded?

Nope, scammers are drawn to bitcoin like flies on shit.  Very, very few companies in the bitcoin ecosystem turn out to be legit.  Even the legit ones are a complete joke.  Just look at blockchain.info asking users to send passwords through email, or using flawed key generation pratices.  Or how about coinbase that just got publicly shamed for ignoring a bug report?  I dont even need to mention the disaster that is mining hardware, or the even more funnier cloud mining ponzi, or the countless exchange collapses, and the future exchange collapses (okcoin im looking at you!).  As of a few months ago someone on bitcointalk measured all the hacks on bitcoin companies and determined 1 in 15 is stolen.  That doesnt even include daily hacks of every day users.  And according to the community if that happens you are an idiot.  Not to mention 1 in 13 is owned by one person, and the rest of the distribution is equally as terrible. Are you starting to see why bitcoin user adoption is just not happening?  Ask anyone on the street what they think of bitcoin and they will tell you "scam" and for good reason.

You can get an idea of how many users they had there.  It doesn't show data for all years, but it shows enough to build a picture that they grew at an exponential rate.
They aren't saints by any means, and there are 10,000 more websites like the one you posted calling PP on their bullshit.  That said, if I'm about to buy something online, there's not a chance in hell I (or most people) will use a service that offers no buyer protection in the form of a charge back.  Bitcoiners like to tout that as a feature, but it absolutely is not for your average consumer.  Sure you could build a service that does charge backs on the bitcoin protocol, but then guess what you have created?  Paypal 2.0.  And why would you reinvent the wheel just to make it exactly the same except with 10x more hassle (by hassle I mean buying bitcoins just to do the exact same thing paypal can do).
Shit just doesn't make sense to me.  Anything bitcoin can do, fiat can do as well and in some cases better.  There's simply no reason what so ever for an average person to buy bitcoin...

@_date: 2014-12-21 00:44:21


First off, that statement is total bullshit.  The ENTIRE community including the foundation members, developers, and average joes tout "MOON, $10,000 $100,000 coins" etc etc, like clock work, all day every day.  Then they say "Don't invest more than you can afford ;-)"  Seriously give me a break.  Nobody is actually advocating you to put in small amounts of money.


I honestly couldn't tell you, I'm not an economist.  I'm not sure anyone could tell you that to be honest.  However if it were to be adopted by mainstream people there would need to be a need for the currency which currently there isn't at all.  If there was a need, there would be theoretically new users at an exponentially increasing rate.  If there were a steady stream of new users, every single day, then the price would likely rise every single day.  I'm not sure if we'd see a single bubble that keeps going up for years until slightly crashing back down, or a series of bubbles like the current climate.  One thing I'm guessing is that if it were a series of bubbles like the current climate, the recovery period between end of bubble and beginning of a new cycle would be much, much faster.  At the moment there's simply no demand and therefore not another bubble.  In your scenario the demand would be high, so the price would continue exponentially even if it crashed for a few days or weeks.  Just guesswork based on nothing though.
Do you think there will be another bubble in 2015 if the current bitcoin infrastructure looks similiar to what it looks like right now?  My guess is no, there won't be another bubble until bitcoin gets the killer app its been promised.  There may be a few pumps along the way to $400, maybe even $500, but I suspect it will not rise past that without a good reason, and perhaps not at all.

Situations are very similiar too, both announcements were made during a harsh bear trend.  This time the price only went up $25 and it's already starting to lose some of it.  Give it a day or two and the price will start creeping back to the $330s and beyond again.

As I sat there plugging in my head phones, queuing up 10 straight hours of sad trombone on my Zune, I wondered: how can anyone not think Microsoft backing bitcoin will not lead to its inevitable take over of the world. I decided I needed do a little more research about this buttcoin thing. I reached over and booted up my top of the line computer running Windows Millennium Me edition and waited. Finally, the desktop. As Internet Explorer 6 began to load I thought how wonderful this news was. I grew hesitant as the page that loaded was unfamiliar to me. I thought to myself "I don't remember Gopher looking like this". I trudged on, determined to investigate this buttcoin thing. At this point I paused my Zune, I could not concentrate with the barrage of ICQ messages I was receiving. Back to the task I thought, you're going to miss the moon.
As my research began to pile, I decided to organize it so I can evangelize my family in the morning. I opened WordPerfect and began pasting in my findings. It quickly dawned on me that I had purchased Microsoft Word earlier that month, and now would be a great time to use it. I opened the software and began pasting. I was briefly interrupted by a talking paper clip who tried to strike up a conversation with me. "Not now you statist shill" I told him as his pestering began to become more and more pronounced. It was then that my computer froze and for a brief minute, everything that was important to me flashed before my eyes.
Sure enough, the blue screen was staring me right in the eyes, my document lost forever. The man at best buy told me that Windows Millennium Me was top of the line, a big step up from my previous platform: Microsoft Bob. I stewed on the salesman's words for quite some time while I began to research alternatives. It had been quite some time since the purchase of my current computer, and I began to consider an upgrade. Aha I thought, Microsoft has done away with ME, and is on their latest product line, Windows Vista. Surely this must be the ticket to my troubles I thought, as my euphoria began to grow.
I prowled news groups that I regularly participate in, in hopes of finding a person who will sell me a new computer. If only there was some method that allowed value transfer to be propagated across the internet I thought. That way I could purchase a computer right in the comfort of my own home. Eureka!! Finally I found a user on a techie news group I participate in. I asked him how much for his PC and he quoted me tree fiddy. I fired up paypal and sent the payment to monster at lochnness.com

So with colored coins is there any guarantee that the currency built on top of bitcoin chain can be redeemed for bitcoin?  From what you wrote, it appears a color coin model would rely on the trust of the issuer that the color coin isn't spent?  Whereas side chains it's guaranteed to be reserved?  Also I assume that the currencies created using colored coins are not mined, which would be another primary difference between colored coins/side chains?

Man take a step back from your position.  Bitcoin isn't a sure thing, and it isn't even a likely thing.  Have you ever heard if it's too good to be true, it probably is?  Apply it here man.  All the shills pumping bitcoin saying 10k coins, 100k coins etc, why don't they invest their life savings?  Why don't all of the major bitcoin figure heads go all in on a sure thing?  Sure Draper and a few have bought some thousands of coins but realistically that's like less than 1% of their net worth.  Why not go all in if you're so very sure about it?  
I'll leave you with a final point.  Most people have heard of bitcoin.  50% of people in the U.S have heard of bitcoin, and more in other countries.  More media hype isn't going to create a bubble.  Bitcoin needs more users for another bubble and bitcoin isn't getting new users.  Once everyone has heard of bitcoin, which they have, where is all the new money going to come from to create a new bubble?  Unless bitcoin gets a killer app, it's going to fade slowly into obscurity.

So the very same people from wall street (assuming that's who you mean by traders) who the people here so adamantly distrust and loathe you want to put in charge of oversight?  Seriously?  Give me a break, be realistic.  Bitcoin has 0 chance at becoming a mainstream product until it has regulations to ensure consumers don't get scammed.  If you think Joe Blow is going to send his ID, billing information, and his money to an eastern European company with 0 insurance that his money will be there the next day, you are severely mistaking.
I for one would absolutely love bitcoin to be regulated and see it as the next logical step to legitimize the system.
The free market sounds good on paper, it really does.  However, in reality, it's a complete failure.  Hence the CONSTANT and almost weekly influx of scams that happen here.

Given bitcoin's history, I half agree with you.  However, it's undeniable that over the last year, adoption has significantly declined, not increased.  If bitcoin can only get adoption via large bubbles, I don't see it having a bright future.  There's no reason for another bubble, bitcoin would have to find an enormous amount of new money.

Those things are cool for techies, but when it comes down to it none of that is useful to everyday consumers.  Absolutely none of that is any reason to buy bitcoin.  People aren't going to buy bitcoin unless it does something they can't already do with cash.  The only example of that as of yet is drug markets.  That's a good start, and will keep bitcoin propped up for years to come, but unless something comes along that actually gives people a reason to buy bitcoin they won't buy it.  Simple as that.


Again, it has to better than existing models, but it also has to offer the same security and volatility or lack thereof as well.  Even if it's 1-2% cheaper and you have a risk of being scammed, that 1-2% is not worth it.  Same with the possible volatility.   I'm not sure if it will ever be better in that respect, because WU is so expensive because the infrastructure to do what they do is not cheap.


Come on, be honest with yourself there are not more than a couple million users worldwide for bitcoin.


Correct me if I'm wrong, that uses blockchain tech, not bitcoin correct?  On top of that they're begging you to buy their currency and their homepage has grammatical errors on it.  How can I possibly take this seriously?  Also there are non block chain services that already take the middle man out of the music industry.


I haven't seen much VC for much else than exchanges, payment processors, and other financial like services.  I'd wager 75% of more of all VC is in those areas.  The only notable things I can think of that aren't are Blockstream, Colored Coins, and Counterparty.

While I have no direct proof, I strongly suspect the owner of change tip of purchasing Reddit accounts to make it appear as if bitcoin is getting new users from change tip.  The thread in was littered with generic comments that reaked of people in third world countries being paid to comment.  Basically one line comments that sound extremely corny and forced with poor grammar, and literally hundreds of them throughout the thread.  Here's some comments from the posters in - not as bad as the ones I saw in but still suspicious.  The first comment below is what most of the ones on looked like, broken English, little grammar, and in general super shady.
* changetip brought me here three days ago! I'm glad it walked me through the steps to collect and what to do.
* I've spent most of the day reading about bitcoin and finally decided to create a wallet and come to reddit for some more guidance. This community is awesome.
* I can confirm this! It brought me to signing up for my first wallet at coinbase.
* I just signed onto Changetip as well. I think it is a great service. So easy to set up. Have to tell all my friends. 
Like I said, I have no direct proof only my suspicions.  However, there was a post on bitcointalk.org of a member there attempting to purchase reddit accounts.  He specifically was offering more money the older the account was.  Go into the thread from the other day with thousands of comments and start reading them.  They just look very obviously spammy.

You can look at any social metrics available and they will show you that every bitcoin sites traffic/user base this year was far bigger than last year.  I believe this subreddit alone experienced a 2.5x growth in 2014 vs 2013, and that's with the bubble happening last year.  Pretty sure Nov and Dec of last year + all of this year experienced more growth than the prior 4 years combined.

My numbers are for the transactions through bitpay and coinbase, which are the two biggest payment processors.  So basically my numbers are strictly for the raw purchase of goods and services via bitcoin.  Those numbers are the strongest indicators of the bitcoin economy.
The numbers on the front page include ALL transactions in bitcoin on a daily basis.  At first those look impressive (well sort of, but when you consider a company like Western Union processes more transactions a day than is even possible for bitcoin to support period, it's starts to look less impressive).  However when you analyze them a bit, you start to find that most of it just literally just spam.
* [ Satoshi dice]( accounts for a large amount of completely uneccessary "transactions" and is even considered a DDoS on the blockchain
* [Mixers/tumblers]( are another form of spam "transactions" which turn one legitimate transaction into tons of tiny transactions to hide the trail of coins
* Transferring money between wallets.  Say you buy coins from an exchange, and send them to cold storage.  That's a transaction, but you've really just sent money to yourself, and yet it is counted as a transaction.
The above 3 "transactions" likely account for a majority of total bitcoin transactions.  Measuring transactions by actual goods and services sold is really the only thing that matters, the rest is just static.

It's really pretty simple.  Just submit your ID, passport, electricity bill, and bank account details to a variety of our Chinese or eastern European exchanges.  After that, with just one click you can wait 5 days to receive your coins, and by the time you get them, they will have likely lost roughly 10% of their value.  As you search for places to spend your coins you'll quickly discover that you can buy a variety of items including heroin, credit cards, and a vast array of child pornography.  If those items don't interest you, just hold on to your bitcoins, where they will continue to lose 60% of their value over the next year.  However, fear not because within the next decade bitcoin will take over the world and become the one true currency where your investment will pay for itself 1000x over.

You obviously misunderstood the question.  You have massive centralized mining with ASICs going on in China.  One operation is as much as 5% of the entire hash rate.  You could easily have a small handful of Chinese mining operations collude and do a 51% attack.  This has nothing to do with pools of individuals colluding, and everything to do with large companies colluding.  You're essentially putting an entire financial system in the hands of a few Chinese businessmen and hoping they don't get together and fuck you over.  As time goes on, mining will get more and more centralized as the b/w and disk space required to do it increases exponentially.  In a few years it's reasonable to think that large mining operations will continue to dominate the hash rate at a larger and larger rate, until it only takes a few of them to collude and do a 51% attack.

I am, for many varying reasons.  I see bitcoin's potential to end war, world hunger, and the reign that dirty bankers have had on our populace for thousands of years.  It's obvious to me that bitcoin is the most important invention that humans have created since the wheel.  The wheel is to transportation as to bitcoin is to finance.  As the owner of a multinational mercenary company that shall go unnamed, I profit from tragedy that happens across the world.  Where you see war, I see opportunity.  Whip cracking central bankers fund my expeditions, and together we suck the fiat out of the veins of civilization.  If bitcoin ever goes mainstream my death grip on the river of fiat will burst like an explosive dam.

There would still be no risk for WU because a bank transfer is not reversible once it's sent.  Additionally you would not have to leave your home to send money, just login to WU and deposit - done.

Paypal had 1 million users in 18 months....in 1998 when the internet wasn't even mainstream, and social media couldn't advertise your service in a viral manner.  Now in 2014 when it takes literally a year for a company to obtain tens of millions of users, bitcoin which 50% of the population has heard of has 500,000 users.  Yea that's pretty absurd growth, absurdly dismal.

* Collusion between one or more people to manipulate the price
* Exchanges selling fake futures contracts that are against the house and not an actual real person
* That same exchange gathering data about trader's positions to then achieve maximum profit with their fake futures contracts
* Exchanges with almost completely fake volume claiming they are the biggest exchange when in reality 90% of their volume is completely fake
* Exchanges that are completely insolvent and refuse to prove their solvency, so next time the price dips they go belly up (Mt Gox, Mint Pal, et all) (next up OKCoin and Huboi!)

I fail to see how people can keep saying that "more and more people" are using bitcoin without evidence.  The transaction volume is flat, and the transactions per day is probably the easiest manipulated statistic, so while that's increasing I take it with a grain of salt.  All the addresses don't mean much either when wallets generate new ones for each transaction.  It seems the best indicator of new users is transaction volume, and I'm just not seeing that rising...

If bitcoin got 1 user its 1st year, 2 its 2nd year, and 4 its 3rd year, that would be considered exponential growth.  And while that's not what bitcoin is doing, that's not too far off.
Bitcoin has &lt; 1 million users so it's growth looks aprox like this:
40,000 80,000 160,000 320,000 640,000
And that's generous.  Compare that with any real company experiencing exponential growth, or a real exponentially increasing tech like smart phones or the internet and you can add 2 zeros onto all of those numbers, sometimes even 3 zeros to each.  Bitcoin is exponentially increasing at a dismal rate and it's unclear if that rate is even continuing.  No bubble in a few more months = end of the "exponential growth".
So far 2014 has been a bleed of users/price/volume, so if there's no bubble soon, all your log graphs and all your talk of exponential growth can be thrown out the window.

I think we'll see coins between $50-150 this year, totally random guess.  I think this entire economy could be supported with $10 coins or less, all speculation aside.  A lot of people on this sub will sit here and tell you bitcoin is rapidly gaining users exponentially, but that's simply not the case.  **Bitcoin has 500,000 users in 5 years.  Paypal had 1 million users in 18 months.**  That was at a time when internet usage wasn't even mainstream, and we didn't have social media to make news viral.  And yet their adoption rate is still exponentially larger.  They will point you to numbers like transactions per day, and wallet addresses created per day.  However, a study recently found the majority of wallets created are completely empty.  The transactions per day is increasing, yes, but the actual transaction volume has actually remained unchanged for a year.  This implies that the number of transactions is increasing, but people are sending smaller amounts.  If new money were being added to the economy, the transaction volume would be increasing, not remaining the same.  It's hard to get solid numbers on the bitcoin economy, but when you do they're always bad.  Bitpay processed less transactions this black friday than it did last year and to give some perspective, it only processed 6,000 transactions last black friday.  6,000!  On the busiest shopping day of the year - and this year it couldn't even process more than that.  Estimates put the number of processed transactions this year at 3,000....on the busiest shopping day of the year....  That is absolutely not an indicator of a healthy economy in the slightest.  Additionally, major retailers like Overstock have reported dismal sales figures throughout the year with bitcoin, and decreasing by the day.  Every time someone accepts bitcoin for their products there is an initial surge of sales because of the hype, and then it decreases to an almost non existent amount thereafter.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:35:23
It's not possible to filter, it would require a script.  Someone is essentially deliberately manipulating the transactions per day statistic to make bitcoin appear healthy.  He's sending 27 cents from address A to address B and then the remainder balance of address A into address C.  Then he starts over again, sends 20 cents to address D and the remainder balance to address E, etc etc.  Literally doing this 10s of thousands of times every single day for years for no reason.

Woah you mean the number of addresses is steadily going up when one is created for every transaction? You don't say!
As far as the transactions per day, the transaction volume is 100% stagnant all year which means that 1.) transactions per day is being manipulated to keep up appearances (likely) or 2.) the same amount of people are sending more transactions with smaller amounts.  Considering that quite literally everything in bitcoin is a scam, I'm going with 1.


The fact that you can name the amount of recognizable brands that accept bitcoin on one hand doesn't exactly prove your point.
How about black friday being worse than it was a year ago?  According to bitpay last year, their black friday is a solid measure of the health of the bitcoin economy.  What happened to that?

[According to this]( the 1st quarter VC money for 2013 was 5.9 billion down from 6.3 billion which means roughly 25 billion VC gets thrown around for the tech industry in the United States alone.  Compare that with bitcoin who garnished 250 million (world wide mind you) in a year, and the number becomes a little less impressive than people are making it.
I mean I'm not saying they're wasting their time, they may not be.  It's speculative, you throw a bunch of money at a bunch of shit and 10% of it sticks and pays off in a big way.  Just because bitcoin got a couple hundred million doesn't exactly guarantee it's success, and it's not really a metric I find useful for measuring potential success either.  The only thing remotely innovative I've heard coming from VC is blockstream, but I'd be interested if you have seen anything else.

Because you have a community who adamantly persuades people that bitcoin will make them rich in the future if they invest their money right now.  They make these claims citing bubbles and how people have gotten rich by investing their money at low prices early on.  However what they fail to tell these people is that the majority of bitcoiners, roughly 2/3rds, have actually lost their shirt.  They also fail to say that in classic pyramid scheme fashion, if new users don't continually pump over a million dollars a week into the bitcoin economy, the whole thing will implode in a spectacular form.
All bitcoin really is, is a really elaborate pyramid scheme.  Most of the population sees it for what it is, it's only a handful of libertarians who are really going to lose their life savings.  No biggie, that's what you get for being greedy.
I mean seriously how many red flags do you need before you realize you got conned?  Exchanges faking volume and trades, exchanges and many other major players in bitcoin going belly up and leaving with your money, origins on darkent markets, most popular uses being drugs and fraud, major business leaders in prison or have been to prison, con men with long histories involved in the bitcoin foundation, fake transaction numbers, etc, etc, etc, etc.  I mean seriously, everything in bitcoin is a scam for fucks sake.

What's small? Cup of coffee?  $30 purchase? $100 purchase?  I don't see a business risking any amount of money on a double spend, even for small purchases like a cup of coffee to be honest.  You saw that CNN video recently trying to live on bitcoin?  She tried to buy food and the confirmation never came through, business basically told her you are SOL, not giving you shit until our payment processor emails us.  Consumers aren't going to wait 20 minutes, and merchants won't risk losing a dime IMO.
I admit I don't know how much space pruning will save, but it will have to be an extremely large amount.  Think about a network the size of Visa @ 2000 TPS.  That's anywhere from 50-80 gigs of data added to the ledger PER DAY.  That's 18-29 TB per year.  On top of that, you're talking 100mbit or faster pipes just to accommodate that data.  That completely forces centralized mining, I don't see how you can get around that.  And if mining is centralized to a few companies, isn't that completely the opposite of what bitcoin actually is?  Not to mention if those companies collude to attack the network, do you really want to put a global financial system int he hands of CHINA out of all countries?!

Yes, centralized systems that have been working for thousands of years are a failure, good point.  They are such a failure that bitcoin mining is more and more centralized everyday to the point where you actively discourage new users from mining because it simply can't be done in a p2p fashion.  In fact, in order for bitcoin to support the transaction volume of even a company like Western Union (a company you circle jerk about replacing mind you), the TPS would need to be raised so high that it would require centralized mining to accommodate disk space and bandwidth.

Mozilla adds "Donate with bitcoin" in very small font on their donation page.  Results?  They project a loss of $144,000 total over the course of less than a month.

A recent poll found 150 million Americans have heard of bitcoin, 70% of the UK has heard of bitcoin.  Number of bitcoin users: &lt; 2 million.  Nobody fucking cares.


That's cute, like most things bitcoin its success depends on shit that simply doesn't exist yet.  If you want to process as many transactions as Visa, the ledger will increase in size at a massive exponential rate that can't be supported.

I never said it did.  I, along with the rest of the world am not convinced the blockchain is needed for value exchange.  When people say the blockchain is revolutionary, they are not referring to using it as a value exchange.  The fact that people here keep touting that bitcoin = blockchain and the two can't be separated is just a lie.  The blockchain will have many future applications and bitcoin will be nowhere to be seen in those applications.  IBM's internet of things is just one future example of this of many more to come.

Realistically any of the major retailers that accept bitcoin now were bigger news than this.  If this was for physical items or even software it would be big news, but it's a small division of their company.  It adds legitimacy to bitcoin, yes, but it's not the massive news this sub is making it out to be.  The paypal announcement was huge, that allowed all of their merchants to instantly accept btc with the click of a button.  This pales in comparison to that IMO.
And market share really means nothing, because Amazon, a smaller company accepting bitcoin, would be way better news than this.

I initially purchased $2,000 worth of coins and was super psyched at the potential of bitcoin.  Then I found this subreddit and after reading the shit that gets posted here I began to second guess myself and cash out.  Many of the top bitcoin players have been to prison, are in prison, or have publicly shown support for companies that have turned out to be scams.  Companies get outed as scammers regularly, coins get stolen regularly, and the community is all libertarian, ancap weirdos who are doing more harm than good to bitcoin.  The entire community from the holders to the developers is toxic, and I can't see it ever going mainstream anymore.  There's too many problems with the system and I believe it's turning into a giant decentralized pyramid scheme.  The fact that new money is required to the tune of over 1 million dollars a week to keep the entire system from collapsing just reeks over a pyramid scheme.
Additionally, adoption is almost non existent.  In 5 years bitcoin only has 500,000 users at the very most.  Paypal had 1 million within 18 months.  However the community here will tell you that user adoption is happening exponentially.  Don't let them fool you, it's a lie, bitcoin is extremely obscure and very few people use it.
You ever heard the phrase if it's too good to be true, it probably is?  That phrase still holds true.  I'm not going to tell you to walk away from bitcoin, because you won't listen anyway.  All I'm saying is bitcoin is likely a pyramid scheme, and don't be surprised if the whole thing comes crashing down this year.
Thanks for the tip.

It's very simple.  Bitcoin has well under 1 million users across the world.  3600 new coins are generated each day.  Unless the current ~500,000 users absorb that level of coins every single day, new users are required to purchase those coins.  According to the stagnant volume and declining traffic to almost all bitcoin websites, user adoption has stagnated.  Therefore supply is outpacing demand.  Therefore the price gets forced lower.  Simple as that.
This current economy can be fully supported at a much lower rate.  There's simply no need for the price to be nearly this high, the economy can't support it - and it's showing.  Bitpay does 1 million in retail sales each day, if we assume coinbase does a similiar amount and tack on an extra for smaller vendors, we get a maximum of 3 million in retail sales per day.  That's microscopic and can be supported at a **far** lower level than $315 btc.

And from what I have read that will not be fixed until its required.    If you are arguing bitcoin is not getting users because its in beta and the devs wont scale it until its needed then it will acccording to your logic never get users.  Quit hiding behind the beta tag, bitcoin isnt getting users because there is 0 reason for the average person to want bitcoin, not because their github labels it beta.

The move up from 316 was fairly gradual with no consolidation on the way.  The move from roughly $360 to $377 was drastic, so we're still consolidating it.  I think within the next 7 days we'll be pushing $400 and trying that $417 barrier again.  I think OP is right though, although I'm not as optimistic as $600.  I think we're looking at either a high of near $417 or maybe a push to $500 before falling again to sub $300.

Well if the original Silk Road handled 1.2 billion in a little over a year of transactions, and the online drug markets have gotten significantly bigger over the last couple years and branched off into multiple sites that are even bigger than SR, I'd say it's a fair assumption the illegal markets are worth at least 5 billion a year.  Agora and evolution are arguably bigger than the original SR ever was.  That doesn't include the hacking, the fraud, the ransoms, and whatever else happens, but we'll just assume roughly 5 billion.  Now we look at bitcoin transaction volume of 50 million a day, it becomes clear that illegal trades are a very, very significant part of the bitcoin economy.   The rest, by and large is day traders.  Bitpay does roughly 1 million in transactions a day in merchant sales, if we assume other payment processors do equal volume, there's no more than 2-3 million a day processed through merchants.  Bitcoiner -&gt; bitcoiner transactions also make a small segment which we may assume a couple million.

Which is a solid indicator that the overall number of bitcoin users increased a similiar amount during or after the bubble.  Which means more users have been burned by bitcoin than not.

Due to the inevitable take over of the USD by bitcoin, my lizard overlords at JP Morgan Chase have written contingency plans such as operation broken arrow.  Broken arrow is the protocol for paying all shills via changetip in the event bitcoin saturation reaches critical levels.  In section C rule 34 it forces us to make changetip accounts prior to any bitcoin take over.  This will allow soldiers like myself to start receiving money again, even if we are on the front lines.

After both of their devastating losses, we were financially ruined.  It took years to recover and I got a part time job to help out.  That was until my grandma came along and sold my parents into Amway.  And then, just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, the Segwey IPO I invested in started tanking.

Tic Tacs was and is the equivalent of bitcoin, allowing transactions with no trust physically. Bitcoin, the analogy I like, is digital Tic Tacs. So assuming bitcoin should be worth like Tic Tacs, here is some maths I've done:
    * ~42,520,000,000 ounces of Tic Tacs
    $16.05 per ounce of Tic Tacs
    * $682,446,000,000 Tic Tac market cap
    * ~13,651,450 bitcoins
    * $329.70 per bitcoin
    * $4,500,910,368 bitcoin market cap
    * Tic Tac ounces = Bitcoins x 3114.687450783616
    * Tic Tac price (adjusted to bitcoin) = $49990.73
This math is flawless, bitcoin will surely be worth at least 50k by 2016!

No, the consumer is not using bitcoin in any way.  Since microsoft does not accept bitcoin, here's how your transaction works:
You give fiat to circle -&gt; circle gives fiat to MS
Or you could just do:
You -&gt; Microsoft
And skip out circle all together.  Since Microsoft doesn't actually accept bitcoin, there's no point in including excessive middle men.  No bitcoin would even change hands in your scenario, it's completely pointless.  All you are doing is introducing middle men into a situation just because you have an irrational love of bitcoin.

However those only give you a rudimentary idea of how it works. Then I came here and read all the completely batshit insane delusions and immediately divested.  Every day I switch between this is an obvious pyramid scheme and this is potentially amazing tech that will be wildly used.  I think if I knew the technical nitty gritty details I may become more convinced.  Right now I see a community of scammers, liars, pumpers, and libertarians and it makes me extremely uncomfortable putting any amount of money in it.  Even the main players involved in this thing are undeniably shady people and so are the main businesses.  
That said I do see a crypto being wildly used  by people knowingly or unknowingly, but not for some time.  In the mean time I definitely expect to see a price point that makes the current price look expensive, so I think I have plenty of time to learn about it in depth.

Ok well multiple people accused him so you can down play it but I believe it.  He's not the only one who likes 13 year old kids, Tony Gallippi (also speaking in Miami!) owned a whole business focused around taking pictures of kids in sexual poses/clothing.  
Despite nearly all bitcoin foundation members being criminals, that in and of itself is not enough to say bitcoin is therefore a scam.  However, when you have [dozens upon dozens of bitcoin]( "businesses" going belly up and stealing everyone's money, you can then infer that the entire bitcoin community in and of itself is a complete scam.
Inb4 bitcoin is a protocol and can't be a scam.  Sorry, when literally everything built on top of your protocol is a scam, its community con men and pump and dumpers, then the entire system becomes a scam.

I keep hearing about "network effect" being the only thing that differentiates bitcoin vs an alt coin.  However, I'm a little confused because I constantly hear about the community going door to door preaching to businesses and articles on crypto currency blogs that explain how to properly evangelize new followers.  What I'm left to conclude is bitcoin (with 100k users or less) doesn't really have a network effect, and can be very easily overtaken by an alt coin.

Just because it doesn't meet the exact definition of a ponzi doesn't mean you should trivialize his arguments.  It doesn't meet the exact definitions of a pyramid scheme, but it holds many traits.  By definition if you convince your friends and family to join it makes your holdings worth more.  I routinely see posts here on how to convince your family to buy bitcoin here.  As far as the capstone, that's clearly Satoshi at 1 million coins.  The Bitcoin Foundation, half of founders were felons and are the organizational structure of the scheme.  With the price of bitcoin last year and this year, thousands of people lost their shirt because there was no more new users to enter the pyramid, so you ended up being the final base of the pyramid.  And in true pyramid fashion, a lack of new users eventually leads to a collapse via subsidized $15 transactions with mining.
Despite your feelings on bitcoin, it has OBVIOUS pyramid scheme traits and is ABSOLUTELY a pump and dump scheme.  Whatever happens with bitcoin in the future may change it, but as of right now, bitcoin is a complete pump and dump scheme to make savvy investors rich at the cost of making you guys, the average joes poor.  So far it's done an excellent job at that, we'll see if the technology materializes - but so far in 6 years there's not one worth while use case for bitcoin.

The elephant in the room right now is that mining right now is barely profitable and a halving will surely push it towards unprofitable.  The other elephant in the room is that right now a bitcoin transaction is not free.  It's $15 subsidized by miners getting "free" coins.  And when you cut their subsidy in half, the money to confirm these transactions has to come from somewhere.  So either the price rises, mining industry as we know it collapses, or users pay $7.5 per transaction.

Bitpay charges no fee.  They buy their bitcoins from consumers who are "spending bitcoins" and then they give real money to places like Microsoft.  Then bitpay dumps those coins on an exchange and if the price is lower than what they paid the consumer they not only do not make money but they lose money.
Lots of bitcoin businesses rely on a steadily increasing price to make money.  In fact, any "no fee" business model is relying on this.  Their collapse will not be a surprise, and will be expected by people that are paying attention.

And just like every other libertarian idea, it sounds great when you write it, but when applied to real life it's down right stupid.  First off, if you're paying fees at your bank, you're irresponsible with money and you are either paying bills late or not keeping the required money in your account, or some issue that is just plain your fault.  Second of all, even if you're terrible with money and end up paying $50 in fees a year: what is preferable $50 a year in fees or life or randomly waking up and your entire savings is gone overnight and 10k in fraudulent credit card bills which you with no money are now responsible for paying for.

Yes, as always blame bitcoin users for everything.  If bitcoin was a real currency Microsoft would accept actual bitcoins and when someone bought something with bitcoin it would just be recirculated back into the economy.  The situation we have now is that Microsoft doesn't accept bitcoin, they accept fiat so anyone who "buys" anything with bitcoin is really just putting their coins on an exchange to drive down the price.  I really don't see how you guys can be in such denial over this, it's 100% undeniable fact.
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:24:56
Absolutely nothing of what you said is based in reality.  None of what you said has any factual evidence to back it up.  All of what you said is an emotionally charged argument because you're both financially and emotionally invested in bitcoin.  If you take a step back from your investment, you'll find that it likely isn't going to see a new all time high unless there's any killer developments in the scene this year.  It's going to take a surge of actual new users to create a bubble.  You can't just create a bubble with the existing money, because it requires exponentially more to make the bubble happen.  So with no killer app to draw users, you're going to have a very, very bad time praying for a bubble.

That's the point I thought you were making.  So basically to prevent complete collapse the system relies on more users - constantly (at least for the early phases).  Thus reaffirming that the entire thing is a pyramid scheme.  The most likely scenario for bitcoin right now is to maintain users or have a very small amount of growth in 2015 and 2016.  If all things stay the same software development/app wise, this technology will absolutely not gain enough users to support those subsidies.

Unfortunately for you I bought the prize for this award last November and it was a full bitcoin.  It has since lost 70% of its value, so I have discontinued the prize.


In literally 2 clicks I am able to find hundreds of posts outside of this subreddit, so fail is really an understatement.


Laughing at ancaps and libertarians.  And if you scroll far back enough, you'd find me making fun of libertarians long before bitcoin even existed.  Way back, pre 2008, reddit was a calm place for interesting things found online and technology.  Then in all their glory, Ron Paul kids entered the arena with their misguided pipe dreams.  Digg and then reddit both became very political as libertarian autists spammed using every method they could.  And now they have this very cool piece of technology (bitcoin) and have completely ruined it for everyone else too.  Wherever libertarian parasites go, their spam and nativity follows and eventually kills the host.  Whether you admit it or not, the bitcoin community is toxic waste, 50% scammers and 50% libertarians, and I'm not even sure which is worse.

Btw that [looks like a pennant](  This means as the markets converge and the bbans tighten we will see a bullish push upwards once the MACD indicators go green while the price crosses over the 20 day EMA.  From there capitulation will become evident as fomo takes over and volume levels increase.

Honestly the people involved in bitcoin are nothing short of conman.  They trick gullible people into thinking if they invest cash now they will be rich later down the road.  It's all pipe dreams and  the entire bitcoin community/services/infrastructure are built on lies.  Every number, feature, and statistic that comes out of here always comes with a hitch and is partially untrue.  Nobody is going to get rich off of bitcoin beyond who already has, bitcoin is not the future of money, and the community is so delusional it makes my head spin.

Seized all funds in unverified accounts months ago
Hacked during major price free fall
Lost $5 million (half of their VC funding)
VC backers removed them off their partners list
Didn't admit to loss until tracked via blockchain
Lost over 1 year potential revenue
Have not proven cold storage
12 hours to shut off services after attack
12 hours or so before even acknowledging a problem!
Vague updates on foreign websites
Promises of 24, 48 hour return (both now lies)
No details of the attack at all
No details regarding anything they are doing behind the scenes
Making eerily similiar announcements as gox did

Do you know if there's any legitimate use of chain transactions?  If you filter out 10 or more, it paints an even more dire picture.  Do you think filtering out 10 or higher is also filtering legitimate transactions for one reason or another?
Also is this metric new, I have been wanting them to add this for a while now, I just looked for it a couple weeks ago and did not see it...
Either way this place reminds me of those fake cities that North Korea sets up with fake businesses, attractions, or even a fake train system.  If you take a small look a bitcoin you see wow 100k transactions per day, high exchange volume, free transactions, instant transactions, etc.  But there's always a catch for everything.  Transactions aren't free or instant, volume is faked, transaction numbers faked, pretty much every bitcoin metric right down to wallet numbers is just fake.  Everything about this network is just artificial to scam people.  And now the whole scam is collapsing down in what I hope to be a spectacular event over the next month or two.

So let me get this straight:
Bitcoin is somehow different from every other altcoin because "network effect" and reasons.
In the last month I've seen 3 articles by Coindesk and Cryptocoinnews that describe in detail to evangelize family and friends.  And now door to door jehovahs witnesses preaching the good word of satoshi to local businesses....
So I'm to conclude that it has network effect yet still for some reason requires all users to solider up and convert new followers?
Or maybe....there are very few bitcoin users, the price is tanking because lack of demand (users) and now desperate to keep the ship floating, you switch to hardcore missionary style conversion tactics... But this would also mean that *gasp* any altcoin with real network effect could *gasp* replace bitcoin entirely in a very short amount of time?!?!?!?
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:48:43
You're terrible at math or way over estimate the amount of people who care about bitcoin.  Let's say you make $20 per user of your machine.  Now you say profitable in 3-6 months, so we'll calculate using 4.5 months or 135 days. So $20,000 in 135 days comes out to $148 a day.  So you need 7.5 people a day to be profitable in 4.5 months.  I've read people complaining they only get 7.5 people in an entire month of owning these machines, so good luck!

I'm looking at a straight downward slope from $1100 -&gt; $370 which has shown no signs of stopping.  None of the speculation of "revolutionary" bitcoin products have come to place, all of the VC money is in payment processors, WU is still cheaper than remittances, and consumers still have no reason to buy bitcoin, what so ever because it offers them nothing traditional payment methods can't offer.  The price of bitcoin is purely speculation and when none of that speculation comes to fruit, guess what happens?  Price continues to slide.  Shoot me a PM when a company or VC throws some money down to an idea that hasn't been done before that is truly innovative.  So far as I can tell the innovation stopped in 2009 the day bitcoin was released.

According to the posts floating around on hacker news they don't even know how they were hacked.  All they did was restore old code from a backup, add a few new features, and called it a day.  And yet...people are actually putting their money on this exchange like it's business as usual.  So if it was a flaw in the actual software, the exact same hack is going to happen again whenever its most profitable to do so.  I mean the downtime associated with the hack is bad enough, but going online without having a clue how it happened is irresponsible at best, negligent at worst.

I don't really care what it's called.  All I know is that tens of thousands of "transactions" to yourself every day for 4 years is completely fake.  You can label them in some other grammar that you want, but that fact is sending 20 cents to yourself 25 thousand times a day isn't adding anything meaningful to the economy.  Therefore citing transaction numbers as an indicator as part of how successful bitcoin is unreliable at best.

Because the community repeats the same mindless talking points over and over that aren't even true.  


Hacks can not be prevented no matter what.  If you create a large enough website it will eventually get hacked.  If you hack target or home depot you get a few million credit cards which are then promptly voided soon.  Hell, if you hack a bank it's not like you can just send every penny they hold to another account.
If you hack a bitcoin site, it's a guaranteed loss of millions of dollars.  Every time.  And with the complete amateurs and or software developers with no knowledge of security that start making sites that are basically financial institutions....it's a recipe for disaster.  Every. Single.  Time.  That to me is a protocol flaw.  You can't secure your coins whether you are an individual or a company.  It simply can't be done and that's been proven.

Actually yes I think it would.  It would prove to me that 1.) bitcoin is pretty resilient and 2.) it might be progressing beyond a speculative bubble.
However, I don't think that will happen for now.  There's simply no reason for it to happen.  If something changes and it gets an app that makes people buy btc, it might happen.  But as is if nothing happens, there's no way you will see $1,000 again.

Bitcoin is failing as a currency in every single regard.  Not only is it hard to use, it accomplishes nothing traditional currencies can't do.  At brick and mortar stores, it's useless because it requires confirmations (please don't recite 0 confirmations is all you need) and even then it fails to work for one reason or another.  It may have some utility for online payments, but again it accomplishes nothing fiat can't.  I'm going to guess that as a currency bitcoin is 100% a bust.  Whether we'll ever see cool apps come from the blockchain is a mystery.  So far, nothing, and I'm actually surprised by that.  I still have hope there will be some cool blockchain apps in the future that might advance the bitcoin protocol.  However, as a currency, shit is popped yo.  Depending on the news of this bitstamp thing, we might be seeing double digits by years end.  That's only bad news for bag holders and get rich quickers.  IMO it would be good for bitcoin because then the true fans and developers can ignore the hype and get started on cool block chain apps.

Here's a sad fact:  more bitcoin users have lost their shirt than broke even or made money.  A handful of early adopters made out like bandits at the expense of the majority of the later adopters.  Bitcoin gained more users when the price was $300-1100 than it did at all previous levels.  So now as the pump and dump comes crashing down, we have people like you to come rushing to the sidelines to proclaim "bu bu but 2012-2014 was xxxx%!!" when in reality, bitcoin will never see another 10x price increase, or even a 2x price increase.  It's going to do a super slow bleed, just like every other alt coin, and have some weak pumps (as evidenced by the last few weak pumps) in between.
Now go ahead, in true butter fashion start posting me links about how bitcoin is such a massive success.  Start with the wallet stats, even know the wallets are empty.  The transaction/day stats, even though 30% are fake.  The exchange volume stats, even though 90% are fake.  Or how about talk about exponential user adoption, even though there's like 100k worldwide users?  
Bitcoin reminds me of those fake cities in North Korea.  Where the government creates these elaborate fake cities with nice buildings, and all these fake services surrounding the city.  When in reality, nobody is in the buildings, no customers at the "businesses", and everything is just a ruse for tourists.  That's all bitcoin is, nice on the outside, but when you do a bit of digging, it's an ugly mess with just fake stats.

I don't know enough about "investing" to argue this, but on the surface it does not make sense to me.  If I was to buy bitcoin I'd set aside 10% of my net worth to buy bitcoin.  So I'd invest $2,000, and buy however many bitcoin that got me.  I would not price out my investment in bitcoin and then set aside the amount of USD.  Bitcoin price is tied to USD, so speculators and investors are putting in how much USD they can, not how much bitcoin they can.  Whether I was to invest when bitcoin was $1,000 or $300, I would still invest the same amount of money - $2,000.  The price of bitcoin is not relevant (in my opinion) to transaction volume.
If bitcoin dropped to $10 tomorrow, you would still have major players tossing around $100,000, the transaction volume would remain the same, the only thing that would change is amount of btc that changed hands.  However if new players enter the market, the transaction volume will go up because there's new money in the economy.
For that reason, transactions per day means nothing to me, transaction volume is a better indicator of growth (in my opinion).

A potential moment of self-realization has occurred!  This is exactly why a deflationary currency can not work.  Everyone has the same mindset as you: hoard it because the value is increasing.  Therefore nobody spends it and no meaningful economic activity happens.  You can not have a currency which is solely based on hoarding.  Strong economies have strong buying power.

I just want you to know that the estimated number of bitcoin users is between 100k and 250k according to the Federal Reserve report as well as a Reuters study.  Bitcoin by every metric is getting worse and worse off, including adoption (hence no demand for coins).  And now when the economy is in despair mode, Bitstamp, the most trusted exchange is potentially collapsed.  Now isn't the time for optimism, it's the time to prepare for the worst.

Your math is bad, I understand - after all you buy bitcoin.  Let me help you:
Hash power yesterday was 358,478,281 hash power today was 229,513,534 that is roughly a 36% difference.  As the price continues to drop $200 looks like the next target for today or tomorrow.  If that causes an additional 36% hash rate reduction (off the original hash rate), that's a 70% reduction.  Not only does it open the network up to attack, but it also turns that 2 week difficulty change into almost a month.  It also would mean almost 20 minute confirmations between blocks.  It would call into question the "fundamentals" of bitcoin itself.

It never works for me either.


I never gave a prediction for the hash rate, I never said what it might be.  All I said is look at how much it dropped in the last 24 hours, which was 36%.


You are right, my prediction was wrong, but why?  Ask yourself why the price is decreasing but the hash rate is increasing, and ask yourself if that makes any sense.  My prediction was based off what was happening already and what has happened in the past.  It's not like I just made this shit up, it's a real concern - and guess what, it still is.


Seems fine to me.

According to that 50% of all bitcoin transactions are chain transactions.  I've read that Satoshi Dice is also 50% of transactions.  So what I'm left with is bitcoin is a network made up of 50% fake transactions and 50% gambling.  Sounds...shockingly accurate.

They have no previous experience in banking or security, so it ends up being a disaster...every single time.  At worst, you're putting money in the of a conman who had intentions of taking your money the entire time.
In the last 10 days, at least 5 different bitcoin businesses have closed shop.

You are asking good questions.  The internet was physical infrastructure, of course it took so long to spread.  You had to convince people to buy expensive and unfamiliar hardware to use the internet.  You also had to convince them to purchase a monthly subscription to the internet and it also increased your phone bill on top of that.
Bitcoin is software, and as you said we're in the days of social media.  The internet has billions of users.  A service like Paypal got over a million users in 18 months in the 1990s, a time when the internet hadn't reached the majority of people in the country yet.  And yet it still managed to far exceed bitcoin's growth by leaps and bounds.
There's no reason bitcoin hasn't reached a higher saturation point yet (it has 100-500k users btw).  Well there is, but it's not something people here want to hear.  That reason is - there's simply no reason for the average person to buy bitcoin.  It offers them nothing a traditional service can't offer.  It's really that simple.
And now your post which asks all the right questions will be down voted and the most thoughtful response you will receive is from me, a "troll".

Then the same thing happens every time: sideways movement for a while and then resume the downward trend.  So let me know how that "bottom" works out for you, because if history repeats (and bitcoiners love to use history as an example of future events) you have not found the bottom, and you just caught a falling knife.

4.) Exchange going out of business instead of scamming its user base (an industry 1st!) - good for bitcoin

The next difficulty adjustment is [scheduled for 15.4 days]( (time is in seconds).  There is supposed to be one every 14 days.  We had one 24 hours ago which means we should have 13 days left.  We're already 2.4 days behind schedule and the pricing (therefore hash rate) is getting lower and lower.  If it continues we'll be looking at 3-4 week difficulty adjustment and 20 minute block times.  That's not the system working as planned, that's a broken system.

First off I suggest you read this entire article.  It shines light on the bitcoin transaction numbers and comes to the conclusion that retail transactions with bitcoin are negligible at best.  This statement is also supported in the Federal Reserve report.  If you don't want to read the whole thing (big mistake, it's a good article) you can scroll down to the "What about retail volume?" section.  It uses Coinbase own numbers which indicate stagnation and it uses a previous analysis of Bitpay's wallets to indicate stagnation.  Both charts show completely stagnant usage for both companies.  They also use a separate methodology (lack of miner fees) to come to the conclusion that consumer adoption is non existant.  Additionally we can infer from Bitpay's lack of Black Friday numbers that 2014 did worse than 2013 (which was only 6,000 transactions regardless).  While not proof Bitpay is stagnant in 2014, it adds to the evidence that they aren't doing as well as they assumed.
Here's a quote [from the Federal Reserve]( regarding consumer adoption:


As far as number of users, come on this is widely accepted as a fact even by bitcoiners.  [An analysis done by Reuters]( a few months ago indicates between 250-500k wallets have bitcoin in them.  If each person owns multiple wallets, we get a number around 100,000 users.  This analysis also coincides with the Federal Reserve analysis which also indicates 100k active users.

Wow side chains do sound amazing.  It's the cure for scalability, the cure for anonymity, the cure for micro transactions, it appears to be the cure for everything wrong with bitcoin.  Bitcoin has 1,000 problems yet side chains solve them all.  Can you point me to the github so I can check out the code so far?  
Oh you mean to tell me that side chains don't even exist and that they are only a concept?  Wow someone should tell all the people hoping for side chains to magically fix all these problems that they don't even exist in any form!  Maybe you should let know, because apparently his masterpiece Reddit Notes will be built on side chains.
If bitcoin is so perfect, why do we need 100000000000 alt coins pegged to it via side chains to fix all of its flaws?  Do you really think consumers will use 50 different crypto currencies for different things?  Doubtful.  Or could it be that bitcoin is literally a prototype not fit for use and a crypto will come a long and fix all of bitcoins thousands of problems, thus eliminating the need for side chains?  No that couldn't happen, that would mean everyone in this sub is investing in a failed alt coin.  Blasphemy!

Or like every other bitcoin business, you rely on volatility and the price going a certain direction to take a spread.  And when the price goes a different direction than the one that nets you profit, you go belly up and steal all the butts.
Not saying this guy will do that, but it seems to be the common theme among most people.

Over the last decade I've been carefully buying up all these cheap pogs.  In the mid 90s, it hit me: pogs were going to change the world.  I saw their value rise rapidly.  I quietly accumulated thousands of them assuring myself a top spot with financial elites.  As the bubble popped and pogs became worthless, I remained convinced.  Pogs would have their day and so I kept accumulating.
People kept telling me pogs died in the 90s, but I remained convinced that their value would sky rocket.  The fundamentals of pogs remained strong the entire time - the slammers remained hard, the pogs themselves remained in good condition.  No dents, no bends.  Overall a pretty impressive pog collection!  
And then black Monday came.  Pogs were trading at $.0001 and Pokemon cards were officially released.  As panic ensued investors dumped all their pogs, crashing the value to 0.
Anyway to make a long story short I got out of Pokeman a few months ago and here I am!

Yes they use multiple protocols on the internet which solve multiple problems which are completely unrelated.  One crypto could come along and easily fix every one of bitcoin's problems.  One protocol can not come along and solve DNS, HTTP, POP, etc all in one go.  That's the difference.

You're right, it's desirable to some people.  And I think bitcoin is serving that small minority of people right now.  However, if you think a majority, or even a lot of people are going to prefer no fraud protection, you're very seriously mistaking.  Hacks, phishing, theft, even just plain losing your cards are all covered.  That stuff happens every day to millions of people, and like it or not these financial services provide what amounts to an essential service.  Can you imagine one day waking up and your bank account of 10k is wiped clean for no other reason than you made a tiny security mistake?  Sorry, but the number of people who want to "be there own bank" is miniscule.  Sounds good on paper, but it's ridiculous in concept.
I've been banking with Chase for probably 15 years and in that time I have never been charged a fee.  I keep the proper amount of money in my account, and pay my bills on time.  However, even if they charged me a $10 fee for some bullshit, it's worth it.  That fee money is going right back into securing my money against fraud.  You think banks can magically just absorb customer losses because they are rich?  No, that money comes from the "evil" fees that they charge you all year.  It's an insurance policy, and it's worth every penny.

You know what else effects the value of money?  A single individual with a few lines of code creating a bubble that increased the value of bitcoin 10 times what it should have been from 100 -&gt; 1000.  All the people who bought bitcoin for over 100 were essentially conned by the maker of the Willy Bot.  Sorry, I'll stick with traditional systems where the entire economy isn't at the hands of a programmer and a few lines of code.  The fact that you think bitcoin is a safer option is laughable at best.


You can use all the security in the world and all it takes is a lack of entropy in your key generation and it's all over with.  We've seen it before and we'll see it again.

Yes, you are.  Bitcoin is nowhere near going mainstream what so ever.  There are only a couple hundred thousand users, consumer adoption is is not happening at all, Bitpay and Coinbase usage are flat for 2014, and retail transactions make up a negligible amount of the bitcoin economy.  Bitcoin couldn't be further from mainstream than it is right now.  Digital tokens are in no way scarce, there are hundreds of different alt coins and a new one can be created with literally a generator.
And to top that off you are hiding purchases from your wife who presumably disapproves (and for good reason) of bitcoin.  So when your wife finds out you've been buying digital tokens behind her back and those digital tokens fail to make you rich, this can only end up one way.

What indicates /. users are irrational?


What indicates /. users have a chip on their shoulder?


What indicates /. users have questionable motives?
Additionally I wonder if you find it weird that every single online community (except this subreddit and bitcointalk) find bitcoin to be a complete and total joke?  Do you think it's a world wide conspiracy to bring down bitcoin?  Do you think you are one of a small handful of enlightened ones to see the truth?  Do you think everyone in the world is a troll outside of this subreddit?  
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:50:45
As for  if there's even a slight chance that a mining collapse could result in a 51% attack (which there is) then I should think that would be a  priority.  If bitcoin is so great, there's no reason to open it up to potential attacks that would ruin all trust in the system.

Of course he's not pro bitcoin, he just admitted bitcoin would not be the future of money.  That's why this is posted here.  We have to reaffirm that Gates supports bitcoin, even know we just learned the opposite is true.

It must be so hard to be a bitcoiner.  So misunderstood by everyone in the world.  So enlightened.  So much more knowledgeable than the richest and most successful people in the world.  Must be completely exhausting to know better than everyone else!

You learned a valuable lesson today:  no numbers, statistics, or "facts" in the bitcoin community come without a hitch.  Their wiki says plain as day 7 TPS is the maximum.  They just conveniently leave out the fact very few of today's transactions actually meet the requirement for that to happen.  Or for that matter, even come close.  I guess it's up for you to now decide if that's dishonest or not.

Theymos is one of three people entrusted with a bitcoin emergency alert key that would allow you to push critical news to nodes.  Another holder is a person that doesn't exist anymore (Satoshi) and lastly, Gavin.  So out of the three people in charge of core protocol alerts in bitcoin, one is a crook and one doesn't exist anymore because reasons.  Bitcoin is so comedic, you couldn't ask for a better situation as an outsider to it all.  I feel blessed to have front row tickets at this spectacle.

Because your account would work fine with low dollar amounts with the information you provided.  A large payment of $1200 triggered a fraud alert.  They accepted the payment pending the info.  You would likely be just as pissed if they denied payment and wanted the info anyways.
Circle and coinbase also have fraud algos that trigger and require additional information from you.  This is nothing new.

I'll never understand the delusions of a bitcoiner.  Constructive criticism, trolling, facts, all of it strengths your resolve for bitcoin.  I could show you 100 reasons why bitcoin is failing right now and it would only strengthen your belief.  As there's a lot of atheist overlap in this community, the irony is so thick I'm left in complete and utter disbelief.  You people are so emotionally invested in bitcoin, to the point where it has a religious like influence on you.  It's just sad.

Of course you are.  First off almost all fiat based services are insured so theft isn't as big an issue.  Second, if you rob someone of bitcoin you send it to yourself in an irreversible transaction.  In fiat if you robbed, say paypal and sent the money to another Paypal account, it would just be reversed and that's the end of it.  Bitcoin is far more susceptible.  Additionally you couldn't hack paypal itself and steal their money because it's not online, your money is just lines in a changeable database.

It's there, just not included in the picture.  It's right next to the Segway booth and kiddy corner from Beanie Babies.  Many people consider those dead technologies, but the fundamentals are still as strong as ever.  I've taken to receiving 100% of my paychecks in Beanie Babies because the next bubble is going to happen any day now.  Sure there value is nearing 0, but everyone knows that's just the calm before the storm.

He told people here to downvote trolls.  I want him to address the mining subsidies.  I want him to explain to me how $10-$80 per transaction is sustainable.  Particularly how bitcoin will survive the halving without losing almost all of its hashing power.
That to 90% of people here is a troll question/concern, and will likely be downvoted as such.  To me it appears he's asking people to downvote any dissenting opinions.

That's simply completely untrue and I would never see a statement that said this if the price is rising.  This is just a pure coping mechanism on your part to rationalize having lost all of your money.  
The price absolutely matters.  How can large transfers of money take place with a small market cap?  Right now if I wanted to send 1 million bux to someone, I couldn't do it without significantly raising the price buying in, and significantly lowering it cashing out.  If you want bitcoin to succeed in any meaningful way a market cap must follow.  And yes, a shrinking market cap IS absolutely indicative of the direction bitcoin is headed, to say anything else is pure denial.
