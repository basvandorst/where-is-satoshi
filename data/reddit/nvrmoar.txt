Fortunately I can afford to lose it but I'd be pissed if I did lol. I was about to spend it on a laptop to replace my old one, but bought bitcoin instead.

Do you think Tails would be more likely to be targeted for zero-day exploits than other distributions because the hackers know that people are using it to store bitcoin because it is more secure? I dunno. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but anyway I only have $35 in btc so it's not a big issue, but Tails was my intended go-to.

I heard this dude who authored this book on a Joe Rogan podcast. Pretty cool ideas he has.

Isn't sticking the wallet on a USB key in this manner technically considered cold storage? Sorry, I'm a bit new to this and all the terminology is overwhelming.

Man, I'm even more confused. If the cold storage wallet is never connected to a computer, then how do keys get added to it? Doesn't it at some point have to come in contact with a computer that touches the internet or come in contact with another device that was connected?

so USAF in bitcoin posts is just a typo?

Thanks for the advice. So, random question. If you had the choice of taking a short 2-3 week vacation traveling the Vietnam by motorbike and using up a reserve of about $2500 or put it toward crypto currency and spend that vacation time at home doing whatever, what would you do? lol

I'm sorry for the noob comment, but I got into bitcoin at seemingly the exact wrong time for a noob to get in. All this Segwit stuff has gotten me confused as hell and scared that something dramatic could happen. If Segwit2x goes through, will my btc most likely drop in price or rise? From what I gathered from a couple day sof reading is that Segwit2x is a positive thing. There will be no chain split, and btc will stay intact. Transactions will become faster and this all in turn should help potentially increase btc market cap, in turn raising the value of my bitcoin? Again, very sorry for this noob question, but I'm in a mad dash to try to read and understand everything that's going on and the intricacies of cryptocurrencies within the next couple weeks before some crazy shit goes down.
