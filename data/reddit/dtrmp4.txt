Posts are still sorted by their score though. Just because it's hidden doesn't mean it's gone.

Yes, governments make laws, that's nothing new. The courts are just one branch of the government.

I really couldn't care less about my email or Amazon shopping being tracked. Waste of time.
edit: Are you guys getting incriminating emails? Purchasing questionable things through Amazon? I'm not trying to defend this law at all, but it seems like a huge fucking waste of time and money.
@_date: 2015-12-19 10:54:57
Man, you gotta get some better formatting there. But my point is still the same: my emails being in a government database is nowhere near the same as publicly posting your emails (and/or password). I don't like it, and I disagree with it, but the comparison you made is just bad.
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:48:30
Indeed, but it's not terribly hard in the first place. That other guy saying "why don't you just post your password then?" is just dumb.
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:49:33
Was this post encrypted? Either way, your account is already 2 months old. It's on the list.

Right. Because the world will move on from Microsoft/Windows just because they're collecting and using our data...

I'm not worried about the government gaining access to my Steam or Blizzard account. You though? Yeah, fuck off. If you can get my password, fine. Nothing I can do about that. But why would anyone give you their password just because the government can get it?

Sorry, it was an estimate. I forgot I signed up for reddit just for [Mining Team Reddit] ( My first payment was [June 26th, 2011] (
But you're right about the spike thing. For some reason I remembered selling some, but apparently not. I just logged into mtgox and I apparently bought 1.994 btc at $10.99 on August 3rd, 2011. 
My gaming/mining computer died and I didn't bother recovering my wallet.dat until earlier this year (because I knew it was secure). I had 1.67 left. Don't remember what I did with the first bitcoin, but the second was definitely on silkroad when it went down. Here's the remaining [0.67 transfer] (
edit: [I was there] (
edit2: closest I see to an $80 spike is around March 2013. That could be when I sold. MtGox only lists my 1.994 buy and then withdrawal. So not sure what happened to that. All I know is I had 2.67 bitcoins, and it's .25 in storage with .015 earned from free btc sites now.

Maybe bitcoins went up 25% last night and you're low on cash? That's why I bought beer+cigs with bitcoins a few weeks ago, anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:05:13
Of course. I mean they're worth a good amount of USD now, not pocket change. I think you know what I meant though.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:13:50
Claim how? I'd rather not. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:39:20
I transferred 1 bitcoin to silkroad I earned from mining and lost it. I never even bought anything :(
@_date: 2014-05-03 05:27:19
This depends on how you're comparing the two currencies. If you compare USD to BTC (and BTC to USD), they have the same volatility. Obviously. Your "$10" of BTC could be worth half tomorrow, but $10 is still worth $10. It might be worth a few cents less versus other currency, but in the US, that $10 is still $10. 
It's hard to compare BTC and USD volatility, when one is a specific country's currency backed by a government (though USD is pretty global) and the other is an entirely global, internet currency.

I did this until my power supply died. Got a replacement, and found out my video card died as well. Sad times.
@_date: 2015-09-06 12:41:05
I just had one AMD card. I would turn off my miner when I was playing games, and leave it on when I wasn't.
I did actually end up with a few hundred dollars, uh, last year? when bitcoins got up to ~$750. So that was a nice reward, years later.

My credit union lets me overdraft for free, as long as I pay back the balance within 10 business days. After that's it's $5 a day.
I once forgot I went over by like $2 and checked to see I got hit with the $5 fee twice. I called them and asked if they would take it off, and they did.

Because the government only knows about the million in my bank account. Not the million I have buried in my back yard.

Going with that argument, why are pennies still made when they cost more than they're worth to produce/distribute?

Maybe this is the problem then. I withdrew .00402 within the same minute I re-deposited .0018. The [withdrawal was completed] ( but the [deposit doesn't show up] (

I'm broke right now, and would totally use my bitcoins to buy a sub.

I've been spending some of my small stash just because $1000 is so high. If it goes down, even back to $800, I saved money.

So spending too small an amount sends the amount, and the rest back to you? In 1 transaction, with 2 recipients, if I'm understanding right. 
What's the minimum amount that isn't "change"?
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:31:07
I see, had no idea about that. Nevermind the second question, I was thinking there was a set threshold, not one based on previous transactions.
Anyway, when can I expect this to go through?
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:13:44
I think this was just meant to be a catchy title, he doesn't even really argue about bitcoin being "evil", just why it's not like dollars or gold.

This worked, and you're the only here to suggest it. Thanks!
