Bitcoin didn't drop to $2000 after his comments.. The lowest was about $3300 before it skyrocketed again. Besides Jamie Dimon's comments had very little to do with the drop, the real cause was rumours of China banning exchanges.

I doubt it'll ever go below 10k again.

A lot of people are going to get burned badly. This is not sustainable at all. I think we'll see a 60% correction soon.

I know that. I already signed up, but something went wrong with the referral link, so it didn't actually register my signup with my friend's name(it just signed me up normally). I'm wondering if I have to delete my account and remake it, or if there's still a way to get the bonus with my current account.

Ty bro. Yeah it truly sucks! :(

Exactly! He's just gotten worse every single year. It's like non stop financial fear porn nowadays.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:23:56
I want to get in before it skyrockets though. It's so hard to time the bottom!

Are you a Coinbase shill? Nothing I said was incorrect. It is a FACT that Coinbase is ripping off people with their fees. You're the only one looking foolish.
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:31:58
Yep, it's ridicolous! Their buy prices are so much higher than the actual prices and on top of that they what outrageous fees. Why is anyone putting up with this company?
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:55:48
Nope, when you sell it's at a lower price, plus I think there's a fee to sell too! It's a straight up ripoff.

Once a Bitcoin reaches $10k in a year or so, he'll probably be on suicide watch. He's an old stubborn man who's stuck in his ways.

I wish I could find one of those ATM's in my country! It just seems so complicated to buy Bitcoin without all this verification shit. It's like every site demands it nowadays, so I really have no clue where to buy 'em. I don't even care about being anonymous or not, I'd just want to finally buy some :/
