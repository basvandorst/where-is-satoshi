I felt it was very disheartening to see that some of the top comments were attacking the libertarian/anarchist roots behind the technology. I'm aware that many of those jumping onto dogecoin are relatively new to cryptocurrencies, but that thread vividly highlights the hurdles this community faces if we're to see bitcoin adopted on a mass scale.

Its a little disingenuous to say that Mt. Gox is the largest bitcoin exchange, when it has bled a large amount of it's market share since mid last-year due to ongoing issues with customers withdrawing funds. By the start of February, it had less than a third of the total percentage held in all exchanges across the globe (dropping to the 4th-5th largest exchange), compared to at it's peak toward 80% a couple of years ago. In that sense, I think you will find that the 'invisible hand' was working it's magic quite well; people voting with their feet and money toward more reliable exchanges.
While I sympathize with those concerned about the lack of 'repatriations' in this saga, bear in mind that this matter has become a criminal investigation, and the US and/or Japanese authorities may yet require Karpeles to compensate affected customers a small percentage of those lost funds. Either way, the community is working on methods to ensure the effect these closures have on the market are marginalized over time. I'd rather an exchange fail than for it to be propped up via a centralized authority, only for them to repeat the same mistakes.

Sounds just like my father, whom is also very critical of the technology but for different reasons (decentralized, takes away power/influence of central banks and governments).

That's an interesting observation; I've assumed the major growth in the liberty movement would be coming from that exact demographic you mentioned, especially given the disaster that has been Obama's presidency thus far. Maybe given the particular forum you're on, it has been perceived in a totally twisted perspective (i.e. an opinion(s) from respected users) and has lent itself a reputation amongst the rest of the members.

The first thing I thought of when coming across bitcoin for the first time as a means of comparison, other than bittorrent, was folding I still remember getting my first PS3 and leaving the application running overnight, using the combined computer power of consoles across the globe to solve those folding proteins. It was a shame that they phased that app out of the console.

I can't recommend Szabo's personal blog highly enough, so many valuable insights into a variety of fields.

You gotta love how these types of folk can whinge and moan about the 2008 GFC, yet still call for the necessity of central banks; completely oblivious to their influence on that very event. I also noticed a post on his blog afterwards, collecting the opinions of his graduate students on the technology. One section caught my interest:


This is what we're dealing with, people.

I'd love to know the opinions of some of the detractors in that thread, three years on. I would like to think they'd have mellowed their negative stance, but considering the angles in which they attacked it (libertarian origins, tulip mania), shows a more in-grained hostility to decentralized solutions that they will probably take to their graves.

I made a deposit yesterday afternoon in person via the NAB, had no problems whatsoever. I also had my details sent to them to allow direct bank transfers recently, where they approved in less than an hour. As a fairly new company, I'm not surprised volume allocation can be a hindrance to their operations. Hopefully it gets sorted out soon.
