Bitcoin is most likely a scam, I mean why was it created lol... why is bitcoin designed like the currency of the world? Why is it anonymous and able to have a finite amount while having the most secure bookkeeping known to man? Why is it designed so the rich can stay anonymous, (panama paper strategic avoidance) and spend their money at the same time? What "mining" or verfication system could increase the value of the currency over time (while diminishing the amount/time) based on power use? Why are people fucking stupid? There are many unanswered questions that could be answered if I didn't skip elementary school, drop out of high school and drop out of college to get a .ca government job later. 
Who knows if it's some retarded pyramid scheme (it could be, you never know the gov might really push fiat past 500 trillion and watch the world explode)
Edit: for those of you who don't know how you can drop out of all three schools and get into all three of them, I have no explanation, so figure the fucking lore out for yourself. Thank you, sorry.

This needs more upvotes 
Edit: new product, In arma 3 wasteland players used to get a special perk called alluh Akbar where there c4 was attached to a special remote detonator that blew up when they were down. Now offering Allah Akbar concealed c4 to all btc holders who live in third world countries or countries with no gun laws. May the hunger games begin!!! (Heavy sarcasm)

If I wanted corrupt police to do dirty work, the first city you would turn to is London ON or the Forest Fucking City, and who knows how many dirty cops are in the force trigger happy. The guy was on the phone with his lawyer while he was getting shot. 4 shots means the officer shot to kill, not to wound. Any fucking officer can easily place two shots in the abdomen or legs and it would immediately disarm the attacker with, who was no threat to there full kevlar but yeah 4 shots is just plain corruption and murder. Responded to his lawyer ok to put his hands up because no one wants to get shot with a child, and even there own child. Holy fuck this is scaring the shit out of me

Article smells fishy, everything smells fishy. If you saw 5 ar-15s or smg's aimed at you, yeah lets bring out my medieval fucking crossbow and shoot at them, hopefully nothing bad will happen logic clearly crossed his mind. Than again, it did happen in London so it wouldn't be a surprise "ONE BOLT SHALL SHOW THEM NOT TO MESS WITH EXCELSIOR"

but clearly I'm smarter than this computer programmer of a retard who probably holds 15 years more education than me with 2 extra children on the side and a wife, so I decided after writing this amazing program thats a threat to the government to get whacked by the wrong cops and to shoot at them with a crossbow. Ugh I hope we all get wiped off the face of the planet at least I know some assholes are going to hell.
