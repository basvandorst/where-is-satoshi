They just take a little while to learn to trust.  I’m on my 3rd rescue.  It’s the best seeing them become happy dogs again.  It’s like watching a flower bloom.

Alt coins are the future. New and better tech that will be utilized for future business models.

I know plenty of immigrants that moved here and stayed.  The only ones that left were because of visa expirations.  Everyone I know that has moved here (hundreds because of my job) has stayed or tried to stay.

Yep.  It's all research and making best judgement with a sprinkle of luck.

There are new and better tech coming up.  Look into POWR, IOTA, ADA, ARK and some others (like privacy coins PIVX, NAV, etc).  All these have an edge in litecoin in terms of tech and promise and are much cheaper than litecoin for now because litecoin shot up so much recently.  I think 2018 is the year of alt coins.  POWR looks really cool and with the rise of solar and electric cars, it’s going to go huge.

Actually there are rescues for everyone.

It hit 19k this week.  It was less than a thousand last year..,  
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:48:02
So is mine.  I’m not an asshole though.

It already is.  It's a working product in Australia and they are making deals with Tech Mahindra in India (huge company).  It has a massive market potential around the world.  
This is always a risk but some coins have more potential in the future than others.  This is one.

Spends on taxes and bills.  Still need a job.

You made it seem like you wouldn’t work and just live off the win...  I own my own business and work my ass off.  I wouldn’t stop.

I went bald at 14... so if you have hair, we are even.

Awesome.  There’s dozens of us, dozens!  And yeah, I too lose weight if I stop going to the gym.  Doesn’t matter how much I eat.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:19:36
Thanks man!  I actually just started drinking whole milk.  I’ll try that out.  I think a couple things that add to my metabolism is that I’m 6’5” tall, and my mom was a Personal trainer and dietician when I was a kid.  I was never allowed to eat candy or desserts, and forced salad and healthy food growing up.  I got so used to that and I rarely ever eat sweets because I just don’t really like them because of my upbringing.

As a skinny guy that eats ridiculous amounts of food and beer and weight gainer smoothies and still skinny, sometimes it’s not.
Edit:  thanks all for the constructive criticism.  I do eat way more than anyone I know, probably twice as much, but I’m taller than my one I know.  I will try eating more but it just seems ridiculous how much I do.

Oh it didn’t go away, it migrated to my back

Currently 36.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:15:50
I’m 36.  Still skinny and eat like crazy.  I’m 6’5” though so my height burns it all off I guess.

Yoda would never be such a dick.  You are a disgrace to the name.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:51:27
Yeah, I would like to think I'm better than that but I'm not.  I'm 36 but I still remember this one guy in high school that picked on all the smaller kids.  He constantly harassed them, but never got in trouble because he sucked up to the teachers call the time.  But, in the locker rooms or out of sight of teachers, he tormented the kids who couldn't really defend themselves (he was the typical big strong jock with dad issues).  Then, at the end of senior year for him, he died in a horrific car crash.  The school held a memorial assembly.  I still remember how all the teachers looked so sad and were crying on stage, but the students all had a sense of relief.  It was a collective feeling of "good riddance".  I didn't see one sad kid in that assembly.

They were big back in the day of cassette.  Nakamichi cassette decks were some of the best.  I've got one that's still kicking along.  Not sure about these days though.
