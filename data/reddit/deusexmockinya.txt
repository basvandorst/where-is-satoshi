You don't even understand my belief system. The only thing you're challenging is my patience.

I don't hear the victims of Harvey and Irma complaining about socialism. Do you?

Yeah, I'm sure State Farm agents are rescuing their clients by helicopter as we speak! What's FEMA? What's the Disaster Relief Fund?

p sure other economic policies have changed since the 70's that might negatively impact wage growth ;)

That's objectively not what happened and you don't even live here.
If the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money, then the problem with capitalism is that eventually you run out of third-world countries to exploit.

The biggest improvement in quality of life in human history was under a Communist regime. The Communist Party is still in power in China today, although obviously the economy is no longer collectivized -- China's economy is something like a quasi-centrally-planned market system.
70% of GDP in Venezuela is from the private sector. Nationalizing one resource doesn't automatically make you a socialist state.
Instead of reciting Breitbart talking points, perhaps you should take a minute to educate yourself.

Ah, yes, we all know how the residents of Puerto Rico and Barbuda are so wealthy that they can afford insurance.

It's not like leftists are advocating for neoliberal financial policy.
EDIT: Why downvote this? Do you not understand the difference between liberals and leftists?

That's not what I said.


You are objectively incorrect. The Venezuelan state does not have total control of the economy. Public control of GDP is barely higher than that of France, and much lower than that of Cuba (your other favorite socialist bogeyman, no doubt).
I'm not sure how else I can explain to you that everything you don't like is not necessarily socialism.

Most of Detroit's debt was in pensions and interest on pensions. Paying your workers isn't my idea of gibsmedat socialism, but you do you, I guess.
