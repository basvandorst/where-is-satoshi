I really don't want to respond since you're obviously a troll, but this info may actually be useful for people who aren't idiots such as yourself: Those numbers aren't absolute. Google tracks all search metrics on a scale of 1-100, regardless of number of actual searches. If a search is at 100 and it was at 5 the previous day, that means it got 20x the number of searches as the previous day.

The difference is that I have a degree in my field (which is not bitcoin related), and I have 15+ years of experience that comes along with peer review, accolades and awards. All this combined allows me to confidently proclaim myself an expert in my respective field.
You have absolutely none of these, and yet you go around making statements as if you are. If you want to have opinions, that's fine, but until you are widely regarded as an actual expert in this field, then you should stop writing books and articles that trick people into thinking you are an authoritative voice that should be trusted. You absolutely aren't. At this point, all you should be doing is writing opinions and thoughtful articles and asking for feedback until you can build up your credibility.

This is perfect. Now they just need to add an "instant repurchase" checkbox whenever you send or make a purchase with your coins. At that point, it will become unbelievably easy to frequent merchants that accept bitcoin without having to jump through additional hoops.
This is how real mass market adoption starts to happen.

Stop being glib. Where did you come from? Your LinkedIn profile has nothing before 2014, your "About me" page on your blog cites absolutely no experience prior to your books. How did you suddenly pop up out of nowhere and instantly consider yourself an eminent expert in this field?
Imagine if a scientist appeared out of nowhere and made a lot of controversial statements about an area of study such as Cancer research. People would want to know what sort of experience and credentials he has to even make such statements. You're making statements that are not only controversial, but considered by many as downright inaccurate.
So again, what sort of credentials and experience do you have that make you believe yourself to be an expert that can go around writing books and presentations about a subject which you have yet to prove you know much about (although you certainly *believe* you know much about)?

Is this really the best guy they could find to act as a bitcoin contrarian? If Barry is indicative of a bitcoin evangelist and this purple-suit guy is indicative of the case against bitcoin, then I'm even more bullish than before because the purple guy has the same level of pomp, conviction and stupidity as someone preaching in Times Square that the end of the world is next week. His "arguments" against bitcoin are nothing more than jokes and talking-out-his-ass remarks (such as bitcoin already passing the VC peak - does he have *any* VC connections or data?). Meanwhile, Barry talks about facts, technology, and direct inside knowledge from his  deep and universally acknowledged financial connections.
And as Barry said at the beginning, the very fact that they're sitting in a room with a bunch of other professionals while at a "Bitcoin: Beyond the Currency" conference with a Bloomberg moderator speaks for itself about how quickly acceptance is growing. Purple guy's response? Talking about his amazing fashion sense.

Hmm your data points are all kinds of weird. Early 2013 bubble started in July 2012 at $5? No it didn't. The earliest you can say a true bubble started forming is Feb 2013 at around $22. Anything before that date is slow and progressive growth, not at all indicative of explosive growth that defines bubbles.
If you look at the start of the early 2013 bubble as $22, that means the peak was only 11x growth, with a stabilization around 5.9x growth. Those numbers are very similar to the late 2013 bubble.

For now, you're right that it has an effect in depressing the price. However, it's a necessary road bump. The more merchants accept bitcoin, the more likely it is that they will be able to use bitcoin to pay THEIR merchants. At that point, the need to convert to fiat starts to diminish. Then, you'll start seeing the opposite effect of what's happening now - instead of a depressed price, the price will start to climb rapidly because less and less bitcoin will be sold for fiat. 
For evidence, look at Overstock's public comments that they will start holding bitcoin as soon as their vendors start accepting it for payment.

Exactly. Imagine if Ferrari made a limited edition car and only produced 200 of them and sold them at $250k. If all 200 owners were open to selling this car on the open market, the cars would probably keep (relatively) close their $250k value. However, imagine if 180 of the owners decided to never sell their car and take it off the market forever. But what if there are another 200 buyers that want to buy? There are now only 20 cars left that can realistically be purchased by 200 buyers. The owners of those 20 cars will realize the market demand is outstripping the supply, and raise the price, potentially into the millions. The only real upper limit is how much the top 20 buyers are willing to pay.

Great job, Zynga. I think micropayments will be one of the driving forces of bitcoin adoption, since credit card fees for small transactions are relatively hefty.
That being said, I hope you guys at Zynga are willing to give the ecosystem time to mature and for people to start understanding the system and using it. I'm sure you won't have a crazy amount of payments by bitcoin immediately, but if you stick with it, I think your numbers will steadily increase.

At $500/coin, there is $12,500 being mined every 10 minutes. 3 years ago, that amount of money flooding the market every few minutes would have completely crashed it. It would have been unfathomable to imagine thousands of dollars of new coins being mined every few minutes. What's changed since then? Adoption. Do you know what $2.5m/10 minutes equates to in the scale of the world economy? It's literally a drop in a bucket.
EDIT: Also, I think by the time it reaches $100k, the block reward will be 12.5BTC/10 min, so you're only looking at $1.25m/10 min. $1.25m / 10 min * 60 min = $7.5m / hour * 24h = $180m / day * 365 days = $65 billion / year.

You are extremely shortsighted. Regulation is not just about protecting your own personal assets, it's also about protection in the *grand* scheme of things. For example, if the government doesn't regulate a financial market like bitcoin, and doesn't institute strict KYC and AML rules, then what's stopping a terrorist organization from funneling money into their cells by using bitcoin? And when that now well-funded terrorist attack happens and thousands of people lose their lives, do you think the citizens of the US will simply say "Oh, that's ok, because at least we have a completely open financial system and the government knows nothing about us." No, they will be rioting in the streets and demanding the government protect them from future attacks.
Are regulations overbearing sometimes? Absolutely. But in the grand scheme of things, they *do* work in protecting you and me from hundreds of different ways that we can get hurt. I don't see anything in the newly revised BitLicense proposal that is so far-reaching and onerous that it will stifle growth and innovation. In fact, it's shaping up to be a pretty fair framework that still provides the protection that normal consumers need.

This is why I don't understand why Coinbase doesn't implement the ability to define "long term storage" amounts. For example, if you know you're not likely to need to spend those 4 BTC on the spot, set them as long term storage, and if a withdrawal request ever comes in, Coinbase will delay it for 24 hours. In that time, the user can cancel. This is such a simple thing to implement and would prevent almost all thefts.

DPR's coins would be a lot harder for them to auction, since they belong personally to DPR and he would need to be found guilty in court and the coins specifically declared forfeit. The coins they are auctioning now were not belonging to him and simply found on his systems, meaning the USMS did not need to follow the same process.
You're probably right about there being [few] auctions in the future, but I think they would be much smaller (where else would they confiscate 30,000 coins going forward, especially as the price increases more and more?).

Believe it or not, they have smart people working there and they're going to know that doing that will crash the price and make the value of their coins plummet. They're going to either sell very slowly over the course of months or years (we're talking government here), or they're going to do it off the exchanges.

TCP/IP, HTTP, email, Twitter, Steam, even Minecraft. First mover is a *huge* advantage, and more often than not, first movers are the ones that end up ahead.

That's a *very* tough lead to overcome.

Your correlations are meaningless. Number of merchants means absolutely nothing. Most eCommerce "stores" are mom-and-pop or hobby operations that barely have any sales over an entire year. This isn't just true for bitcoin, it's true for credit cards, PayPal, etc. Not to mention that a lot of merchants are probably signing up for accounts without an actual operational storefront. 
The only real number that counts is the number of transactions. Like you said, in March, there were 5,100 transactions. In October, just 6 months later, there were 20,000. November saw 55,000. 
How you can say that noone is spending money with BitPay is beyond me. It's even more beyond me that you're actually being upvoted. In the span of 6 months, BitPay saw a 400% increase in volume, and potentially a 1000% increase if you factor in November (we'll need to wait for December numbers to find out exactly how much Black Friday skewed things).

It has to do with the fact that we were in a bubble. All bubbles must, at some point, run out of steam and consolidate before any future run-up. The November bubble went from $150 to $1200, or a 800% rise. The April bubble went from $35 to $266, again an 800% rise. Coincidence?

Just time. It doesn't matter how in the news it is. Nothing can go up and up and up without periods of consolidation between periods of exponential growth. It's been less than 2 months since the last bubble ended. Look at the volume. A lot of people are taking a breather, a lot of money is sitting in the sidelines. A lot of people think the same way - "I'll wait with my money until I see that this market is really going up again". 
Each piece of good news makes it that much harder for people not to invest. Eventually it reaches a critical mass where enough players enter the system, causing others to enter, and that causing others, and on and on and suddenly you have a bubble. 
That's what happened in the November bubble. In fact, there was a thread started on this sub about a week before the bubble really took off where someone very correctly said "we're on the verge of another bubble". He laid out all the facts and he was able to see the critical mass starting to happen.

Sure, it brings attention to crypto-currencies, but not the good type of attention. Don't forget that mainstream media is only now finally starting to not laugh or smirk any time bitcoin is mentioned on air. Wall Street is paying attention. Venture capitalists are looking to get involved. The world is taking note and reevaluating the traditional financial system - slowly but surely.
And then, suddenly you have dogecoin retards invading serious discussions like this Google Moderator post and it starts to put everyone back into the mindset that crypto-currencies are for kids and hackers and should not be taken seriously.
Dogecoin is not the kind of attention we want to get. That's just my 2 cents.

It's important to note that there will *never* be anything even close to 21 million coins in "active" circulation. Millions (yes, millions) of coins have most likely already been lost in the first 2-3 years of bitcoin's history. Satoshi owns a million coins which very possibly will never be used. Even today, with all the user-friendly applications coming out, I would bet that 100s of coins are lost daily in some way or another. If I had to guess, I would say that once all 21 million coins are mined, only 50% will actually be available to be used.

Nothing. Keep doing business as usual. You got 2 serious inquiries in 20 days. Next month, it may be 5. By the summer, it may be 10/month. Bitcoin is not meant to be a marketing vehicle. It's a new way of transacting, and it's slowly gaining understanding and acceptance by the mainstream. As the months pass by, maybe you'll see your services being paid more and more often in bitcoin, without even noticing.
By accepting bitcoin, you're part of a financial revolution. The very fact that you successfully set yourself up to accept it means you **succeeded**, so stop thinking you did something wrong.

I can think of many:
* Can pay a seller without releasing private information like a credit card number (believe it or not, consumers *do* care about security and many, many people are afraid to transmit credit card numbers)
* Building on top of the previous point, once online bitcoin services are completely secure and trustworthy, there will essentially be no way for consumers to be defrauded and have their private info stolen, like what recently happened with Target
* Paying by BTC is already faster than paying by credit card and having to input billing address, credit card number, expiration, CCV, etc. As bitcoin infrastructure improves, the speed will only get even better
* Bitcoin requires nothing additional to carry. Everyone already carries their phone. Credit cards require wallets, especially when people are holding multiple cards. For women, it may be a non-issue, but as a man, the only reason I have a wallet is to store my credit cards, and it just takes up room in my pockets
* You lose your wallet / have it stolen, you have to go and cancel every single one of your cards, spending potentially hours on the phone. In the meantime, your cards may have been used to make thousands of dollars in purchases, which you now have to dispute. With bitcoin, you lose your phone, you don't have to cancel your bitcoin wallet. If you want, you can create a new wallet and transfer funds to it in seconds, just to be safe
* Many, many other reasons that I've thought of over the past few months but I think I've made my point...
As for ease-of-use and the ability to chargeback, reverse transactions, etc, these are all issues related to infrastructure, as you said. Bitcoin is just a protocol, it's up to the solutions providers to develop all these "sugar" features. And as they do, the bitcoin protocol will evolve with them. Remember when web sites used to be static and every time you did something, the whole page had to reload? Now, every site is completely dynamic and we're able to manipulate entire pages without a refresh. This has opened the door for web apps that rival desktop software like Google Docs, etc. Even 5 years ago, that would have been unthinkable. But web browsers continued to evolve, and with them, the HTML protocol did as well. I see the same future for bitcoin and the features surrounding it.

The amount of money in circulation is meaningless. If bitcoin began to achieve critical mass (which would be well before the 1000x rise), it would begin to be thought of as a currency and a way of transacting in and of itself, not reliant on other currencies. At that point, you would have millions of people throughout the world that would be transacting and living their daily lives solely with bitcoin. They would be paid exclusively in bitcoin, they would be transacting exclusively in bitcoin, they would sell their houses exclusively in bitcoin, etc.
Once that happens, you are no longer are looking at circulation, M2, etc. What you're looking at is the wealth of the world and the amount of money that a person's wealth is worth. Currently, the total wealth of the world is somewhere around $250 trillion. For bitcoin's market cap to reach $9.36 trillion, it would mean that approximately 4% of the world is tying their wealth exclusively to bitcoin.
When you start to look at it that way, does it still seem so ridiculous?

I'm all for sober realism, but $10k/coin is not an "extremely bullish take on bitcoin". In fact, it's a pretty damn bearish take on bitcoin. At $10k/coin, you're looking at a market cap of $160 billion, *if* all coins are available (which they aren't). At $160 billion, you're talking about .3% of the world's $60 trillion M2 money supply. That means your "extremely bullish" scenario is that the world still operates 99.7% of finances outside of bitcoin.

This is exactly right. For the time being, most people are not going to spend bitcoin, but the truth is that they don't need to. All we need to happen right now - and it **is** happening - is for more and more infrastructure to be built and for more and more retailers to begin accepting it as currency. Eventually, a tipping point will happen where people are going to demand from their employers to be paid in bitcoin, because it will be almost as easy to live on bitcoin as it is on the dollar. At that point, you'll suddenly see an explosion in bitcoin adoption among consumers.
Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that bitcoin usage will not be a steady rise. It will be waves of modest gains followed by periods of explosive growth.

Here's why this isn't quite as crazy as everyone believes: first, I think pretty much everyone knows that if the winning bid is above market price, the news will hit mainstream media and the market will rally to at the very least match that price. Bidders on this auction know this fact as well. Second, this USMS auction is by far the most legitimate and safe way that we have EVER seen to buy bitcoin. In fact, there is literally noone more legitimate and safe than the US government (all jokes aside). For institutional and rich buyers, this is much more important than you may think it is and these buyers will pay a premium for that privilege. 
So, you have a perhaps once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy from the US government, coupled with the general knowledge that the market will likely match whatever the winning bid is. On top of that, you have a sealed bid auction that will cause paranoia among buyers and will force them to inflate their bids to "ensure" winning. Put this all together, and perhaps a winning bid of $1800+ is not so crazy after all.

Any launch of any product or service in any industry will always see huge upfront numbers. The real numbers that count here are that Overstock initially estimated $5m in sales in year 1, and have now upped it to $10-15m due to higher-than-expected demand.

Thanks for posting this - I was personally looking at this as well yesterday. The similar pattern between the April bubble and aftermath and the November bubble and aftermath is pretty shocking. 
As for other observations, bitcoin has never had more than 5 red candles in a row (on the 1w charts). We are now at 4, heading into a possible 5th. If the pattern holds, we have one more down week before we hit an uptrend. Also, the two previous times that 5 red candles have formed, they were followed by several months of slow but steady growth, a final small dip, and then culminating in bubbles.
Take from that what you will.
**EDIT:** Here's an annotated chart:  .... Basically, the last three bubbles have followed an *extremely* similar pattern of 1. bubble, 2. bull trap, 3. selloff (3-5 candles), 4. recovery, 5. final dip. The late 2013 bubble seems to *so far* be following a very similar pattern.

What's that? You don't want to move to Africa because you don't want to be constantly fearing for your life and property? Hmmm, suddenly living in a country with heavy protection for its citizens doesn't sound so bad, does it? 
You can't have it both ways. You can't demand the government protect you from getting hurt without giving up anything. You also can't pick and choose what protections **you personally** want. Most people in this country want their finances protected and that requires regulation. You don't want those protections?

Because the bitcoin market is made up of extremely twitchy, fearful traders who get spooked by their own shadow. There are very few professional traders in the market, and it shows. As high as the price is, this market is still unbelievably immature and has a long, long way to grow before it has enough professional traders and institutions to shrug off stupid FUD events like this.

Ok, so here's what everyone fails to understand: the price of bitcoin has *nothing* to do with how much money is actually being stored / transacted in it. That's why we're at $10bn market cap with very little transactional volume (BitPay reported $100m for the entire year).
The price per bitcoin is driven by the market. If there are many buyers and very few sellers, the price can skyrocket, without any correlation to any other factors. It's supply and demand in its purest form. 
If bitcoins start being gobbled up by the rich in order to replace their "offshore tax havens", that means that there will be far more bitcoins being used for storage than readily available on the markets for trading. If there are fewer bitcoins available for trading, that means that there will likely be a situation where demand outpaces supply, whereby the sellers will start to demand higher and higher price for each bitcoin they sell.
Essentially, what it all boils down to is that yes, it is *theoretically* possible for the price of bitcoin to jump to $2.8 million even if only 1% of offshore tax haven money comes in. I'm not sure how he calculated that exact number, but I can almost certainly guarantee that if 1% did come in, the price would not simply move to $20k.

I'm not sure if you're talking about the suggestion I posted 2 weeks ago that Coinbase replied to and said was a great idea. If so, this is actually not the same implementation. I suggested that they create a mandatory 24 hour hold, not a 2FA hold. Maybe the 2FA feature is unrelated and just something they were already working on? Who knows. 
The 2FA hold is nice, but doesn't add that much more security imo. I'm hoping they still implement the mandatory 24h hold. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:30:07
Read the whole suggestion: 
TL;DR: It's strictly opt-in, and you can have the hold only go into effect once a user-defined threshold is reached. For example, you can only have the hold apply after reaching $100 of withdrawals in a 24 hour period.

I highly doubt it. Reading through the documents, this reads to me like OKCoin is playing the standard Chinese business games, and Roger is is very entrenched in his Western business culture. There are vast differences between how Western business is conducted and how Chinese business is conducted, and OKCoin's actions are pretty typical for Chinese businesses. I don't think they have any liquidity issues, just a cultural gap that is causing them big problems when communicating with Roger.

And you're completely misinterpreting my intentions. I'm not trying to defend OKCoin. I'm trying to show that there are 2 sides to every story. People in this subreddit (and reddit in general) like to go on witch hunts and get their pitchforks out, but there is almost always a side that gets drowned out. Roger is not totally innocent here - from what I've seen, the contract is heavily tilted in his favor. Just take a look at the facts until now - so far, OKCoin is down ~$50k, and Roger is up $50k. Is he the victim? He may very well be, but it could also be that OKCoin are the victim, or they're both victims. That's what I'm trying to say.

Unfortunately, as Westerners this seems very shady and deceitful to most of us. However, I can tell you from experience that this sort of behavior is very standard and normal in Chinese culture and it's how business is conducted in China. Star and OKCoin are communicating with Roger in a very typical Chinese way, while Roger is trying to communicate back with them in a typical Western way.
This is a perfect example of cultural differences turning a situation that may otherwise be resolved quickly into one that is a huge mess. I've worked with many Chinese companies and reading through the emails, I can't help but smile because I've seen this sort of behavior time and again. It's absolutely jarring for an American or European person because we're used to very cut-and-dry business relationships that are very "straight". In China, business is much more "fluid" and it's often a tango of one party always trying to find ways to go around the other party. 
I can almost 100% guarantee that OKCoin has more than enough money to pay Roger every month without any problems. However, Roger is also somewhat at fault here for negotiating a contract that by all means seems to favor his interests too strongly. In business, you want to get the best possible contract terms, but you never want them to be **too** good because it will lead to the other party being unhappy and you'll eventually lose out in the end. The perfect contract is one that favors your interests while keeping the other party begrudgingly content. However, Roger's contract with OKCoin seems to be a perfect example of a "too good" contract, and it's no surprise that OKCoin wants to renegotiate.
The problem, however, is that OKCoin is going about renegotiation in the Chinese way, while Roger is working in a Western way, and this is what's causing the fireworks.

First, most people are aware that they've been compromised, they simply are not able to lock their accounts before the hacker is able to do the withdrawal.
Second, this is easily overcome by having Coinbase send an SMS message that a withdrawal has been initiated from long term storage.

The dogecoin community honestly scares me. At first I thought it was funny and a great joke and a good way for people to play with crypto-currencies without being too serious. But those people are a little crazy. They honestly believe that one day the entire world, major retailers and banks and all will one day be transacting in doge and saying "wow much moon".

You're absolutely right, going from 5,000/month to 20,000/month in only 6 months is absolutely pathetic. Give me a break.


BitPay has publicly stated that Black Friday sales were around 6,000 transactions. Yet December saw 55,000 transactions total. Even if we give Black Friday the benefit of the doubt and double the numbers - 12,000 transactions - it still puts December at 40,000+ transactions: 2x the 20,000 in November and 8x the numbers from 7 months prior.

So I'm just trying to understand this correctly. If one day all shares on the stock markets are represented on the blockchain, with a formula of say 1 satoshi = 1 share, does that mean that to keep track of Google (683M shares) would require 6.83 bitcoins? To keep track of Microsoft (8.1B shares) would require 81 bitcoins? And so on and so forth?

Hey Roger, thanks for personally replying. Like I said, I don't find the fault with you specifically, but rather on both sides equally albeit for different reasons. That being said...
I don't think the contract is one-sided because of the price being paid. In fact, I think the $10k/month is of minimal concern to OKCoin. From what I'm reading, the main issue at hand is that OKCoin can put an entire team on this project, and invest a lot of resources, only to have the constant risk of you pulling the plug at any time. In other words, you have all the power, and they have none. This is what seems one-sided to me about the contract. 
In addition, it seems like they can't pull out of the project even if they wanted to, because the only party capable of terminating the agreement is you, and with just a 30 day notice. 
So it seems that they're expected to pay a lot of money every month, in addition to paying for the team and resources expended to actually build out the domain, with the constant risk of losing everything if you give 30-day notice for *any* reason. Conversely, if the project doesn't go as expected for them and they're not getting the returns they thought they would, they don't have the same privilege as you have to end the contract.
Of course, I haven't seen the contract and I'm only going by the content of the emails. But if this info is correct, then I hope you can see why this is a one-sided contract.
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:36:53
The contract is very much one-side in Roger's direction. Star and Jack mention this several times in the email exchange. This is what can be argued is an "unconscionable contract" (look it up), and has many incidences where it is nullified by judges if these things go to court. It doesn't matter if their CTO signed it or not. 
In addition, the contract seems to be with OKCoin, which as Star says is not a real entity. The real entity is "OKCOIN PTE, LTD". That may sound the same to you, but in a court of law those are two COMPLETELY different entities.
Finally, Roger is getting in trouble with law enforcement, which can cause harm to OKCoin simply by means of association. They can absolutely request for a contract to be nullified on those grounds, or at the very least re-signed with a different beneficiary (which is actually what they did).

As for my identity, it's absurd. Look at my posting history. I've been on reddit for years and prior to today I never mentioned OKCoin in any of my other posts or even got involved in OKCoin-related threads. 
From reading the email chain, it appears that Star got the "forged" contract from CZ, who no longer works at OKCoin. If these documents are in fact "forged" (and as evidenced in prior threads, there is still a fair bit of speculation about), then they could be forged by OKCoin or they could be forged by CZ and given to OKCoin. As of now, we don't have that information, so there's no way to make judgement on it. I'm just giving my opinion on things that we DO have information amount.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:51:29
Actually, it's not. These sorts of contracts are nullified all the time by a court, and they are called "unconscionable contracts":
"Unconscionable contracts are those contracts which are so unfair to a party that no reasonable or informed person would agree to it. In a suit for breach of contract, a court will void an unconscionable contract. That means the court will not award damages or order specific performance against the person unfairly treated."
Essentially, Star is saying to Roger that his contract is an unconscionable contract because it should never have been signed, and was done so solely by CZ, who is no longer with the company. In a court of law, there is a high likelihood that OKCoin would win the case.

I think we're reaching the point in bitcoin's history where sites are going to start writing controversial articles on purpose just to get viewership. It's a very well known tactic that is used by writers covering almost any topic. The fact is that truthful and well-researched articles educate the public but don't drive clicks. On the flip side, blatantly wrong and biased pieces of journalism cause firestorms that bring in thousands of viewers, which translate to dollars. 
I've been seeing this more and more with bitcoin over the past few weeks (comparing bitcoin to "financial dinosaurs" and private currency in the 1700s, Krugman calling bitcoin "evil", etc etc). It's all just sensationalist journalism for the sake of getting hits.
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:52:55

I actually didn't see your previous post in the other thread.
As for my identity, it's absurd. Look at my posting history. I've been on reddit for years and prior to today I never mentioned OKCoin in any of my other posts or even got involved in OKCoin-related threads. 
In regards to who is at fault and whether or not OKCoin can pay the $10k/month is not the core of the issue and I personally don't believe that it is the reason that OKCoin is taking up issue with the contract. They're taking up issue because it is a contract which is inherently unfair to them (for the reasons I state above), and it is one which was signed by someone else in the company who is no longer there. Imagine if you're the CEO of a company and you know that you have a team that is working on a project, but when you actually look into it further a few months later, you discover that the team is burning through cash and is destined for failure. As CEO, it's your job to step in and correct the situation. From the email conversation, it sounds like Star knew about the domain, but probably didn't know the terms of the agreement that CZ made. Now, he's finding out that the terms are entirely untenable from OKCoin's side, and he's trying to fix the problem by renegotiating the contract. That's how I'm interpreting it.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:05:39
The money laundering thing is completely overblown. It's literally a situation where OKCoin is saying to Roger, "We're concerned about your legal troubles, and we don't want to get caught up in your problems. Can you provide us a different legal entity to send money to that won't get us tangled up in your issues?" This is also said to Roger in the broader context of creating a new contract, meaning that OKCoin wanted to use the new recipient in the new contract, which would make it completely legal. However, Roger immediately replies saying they want to perform money laundering. 
As for impersonating a lawyer and pretending not to speak English, Roger and his lawyer make these *accusations*, but there is absolutely nothing in the transcripts that shows that these accusations were anything but that. I can accuse you of being a criminal, but it means nothing unless it's actually proven.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:21:25
Exactly, and it seems like that's what we're seeing here. It's unfortunate, and it's why OKCoin should hire a senior Western executive to deal with Western business interests. Otherwise, you get these sorts of situations which lead to all sorts of misunderstandings (and the community thinking that OKCoin is insolvent).

It's like going to play blackjack at a casino where the deck is specifically arranged to make the dealer win every hand.

Actually not a bad article and some good insight there. No matter what you think of regulation, it's clear that the bitcoin **markets** need regulation (before you all flip out - markets are different than the technology). There is rampant manipulation, collusion and insider trading going on, and like this article shows, that is very bad for the price of bitcoin. The people who are most likely to perform these nefarious actions are the people who don't give a damn about bitcoin and just see an unregulated market that they can profit off of. Like he says in the article, these people have no problem with driving bitcoin to the ground just to make a quick buck. 
We need to understand that there are likely many professional, high worth traders pouring into this market simply because it's the Wild West. They can pull things on the bitcoin markets that would land them in prison on a regular stock exchange. That's very appealing to any professional trader and again, they don't give a damn about bitcoin as a technology or about going "to the moon". The only moon they care about is inside their own pockets.

1. Again, this is a typical game that is played by Chinese businesses. If you read carefully, they are actually correct - the contract is signed by an entity called "OKCoin", but the Singapore company is in fact "OKCOIN PTE, LTD". Believe it or not, that makes a huge different in the legal world. At the end of the day, this is just one of the ways that OKCoin is using to invalidate the original contract.
2. This is also what always amazed me when working with Chinese companies. No matter how large the company, they *always* seem to have issues with hiring people that can actually read and write English properly. That's also why you see those humorous pics of large stores in China that have very obvious errors in their English advertisements. For some reason, Chinese companies never want to hire native English speakers, even with important matters.

The flaw in this guy's thinking is he likens the $1200 ATH to the dot-com bubble, of which the NASDAQ has still not recovered to, 15 years later. He says that bitcoin is currently in its 2001-2003 period. However, if that's true, then it means that by the time bitcoin usage is at market saturation (as Internet usage is close to now), then its total market cap will be around that ATH, or approximately $15bn? Half the world's population is using the Internet. If half the world's population is using bitcoin, its market cap will need to be much, much, MUCH higher than $15bn. If the Nov 2013 bubble peaked at $500,000, then maybe I'd see his point. But to compare a $1200 peak to the NASDAQ in 1999 is really preposterous.

I don't think so. OKCoin has had some visible changes in personnel over the past few months and accordingly, some of their strategies may have changed. $120k/year is a lot of money for something that may not be providing much, if any, ROI. Everything that is going on sounds to me more like typical business sneakiness to get as much as possible for as little as possible, and not a case where OKCoin has money problems.

Bingo. I used to do a lot of business with Chinese companies, and they love to pull these sorts of games. Not because they don't have the money or because they have bad intentions, but because these are very standard business practices in China, even for large corporations.

This doesn't make any sense to me. If the Willy bot was real and Mark was buying a tremendous amount of coins with money that didn't actually exist (or was taken from depositors), then MtGox would have succeeded wildly. Instead, we know it crashed and burned.
Think about it - if Mark is buying thousands of coins with money he didn't have, this is essentially exactly the same as buying on margin. When people buy on margin, they do so because they believe the price will go up. The more it goes up, the more they gain, because they can then eventually just sell at a certain point and pay back all that "borrowed" money while still having plenty left over for themselves. As we know, there was a huge bubble, which means that if mark was buying on margin from when the value was $15 (the price prior to the Apr 2013 bubble), he would have made an absolutely TREMENDOUS amount of money. Even when MtGox folded, the other exchanges were at around $800.
So again, it makes no sense that the bubbles were caused by a bot he had running that just bought coins without actually having the money. If that was the case, he would have made millions, if not billions of dollars. 
What makes a lot more sense is the exact opposite - that Mark was trying to SHORT the market all the way up through the bubble, constantly losing as the market kept pushing higher. This also makes more sense with the fact that fiat withdrawals were limited. If MtGox was running low on fiat to give to customers, then Mark would likely try to produce additional fiat to cover. How do you produce fiat? If you buy coins, you're losing fiat and gaining bitcoin, so that doesn't work. No, you'd have to SELL bitcoins to produce fiat, which is what I think Mark was trying to do throughout the two bubbles, yet as the market continued to turn on him the situation just got worse and worse.

If XT becomes the dominant chain, then the currency traded on it will still be BITCOIN, not some other altcoin. If you don't agree with that, then you should also ban any discussion on Lightning network, sidechains and many other topics.

If this theory were to be true, it again means that Willy never caused the bubble(s) and was instead some sort of mechanism to try and profit from them for the sake of easing some of MtGox's debts. However, my only question with this theory is why would the coins then be transferred to China to be sold? Why not just sell them on MtGox itself or Bitstamp?It doesn't seem to make much sense, especially because there were warning signs for weeks before the Dec 2013 peak that China was about to crack down and to get your money out.

It has nothing to do with bits or bytes. It has to do with number of possible combinations that a character set can have. 
For example, binary is an extremely basic character set - literally just 0 and 1 (therefore it is base-2). Because of that, expressing anything in binary requires many more characters than in a character set which is bigger. For example, signifying just one letter of the English alphabet requires 8 binary "characters". Thus, you could write a "sentence" of 64 binary "characters" in just 8 English letters, because English is a much bigger character set. 
Similarly, Skype emojis are a much bigger character set (128 possible characters) than an alphanumeric character set, which means you can express a bitcoin address in far fewer characters with emojis than you would with with alphanumerics.

If you're sending money to an address, there is no need for you to have any clue of the current state of the blockchain. Your message is just a signed transaction that details your wallet address, the recipient wallet address, and the amount.

People are responsible for where they put their money. There were plenty of warning signs for MtGox and there are plenty of warning sings for Bter. Just like there are big fiat banks where your money is "safe" and there are shady, little fiat banks that could disappear at any moment. Believe me, history is absolutely riddled with little banks going under and taking every customer's assets with them. In fact, this is the main reason that FDIC was created in the US - to save your money in the event a bank fails (and even with that, you can STILL lose your money). In almost the entire rest of the world, something like FDIC doesn't exist and you basically just have to exercise good caution about which bank you put your money into.

If this is actually real and not just Coindesk pulling stuff out of their ass, it could also just be a case of a PR representative within PokerStars that doesn't have knowledge of the project. Left hand is not talking to the right, etc.

I'm not sure why this is getting upvoted. Everyone keep trumpeting those words - "at this point" - every time some government makes an announcement.
People, **every** decision made by **every** government or agency in the world is intrinsically "at this point". Decisions are made in the here-and-now, and nothing is ever a guarantee. In the 20s, the US government declared alcohol illegal. In the 1800s, it declared slavery legal. Who cares? Each country lives and operates by its laws at that moment. Right now, the Fed sees no reason to act against bitcoin. Will it change in the future? Possibly. Or in the future it may declare the dollar insolvent. Anything can happen. Constantly parroting about how their stance may change provides  **absolutely nothing useful to the conversation**. This article is about a Fed president's statement today, and that's all.

From what I can tell, they're saying that they do so many orders, that even at a few hundred bitcoin payments a day, it's inconsequential for them. However, he points out that when they began accepting iDEAL, they only did 10 orders a day, and they kept taking it. He sees Bitcoin adoption as growing, so he thinks it will become more and more important for them.
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:32:54
As bitcoin matures, so does the economy around it. Increased adoption throughout the world leads to increased demand, which intrinsically means a higher price per BTC. Bitcoin is not like the dollar - there is a limited supply of it, which means that when the 99% want to start transacting in it, they need to get it from somewhere - the 1%. Since the demand (99%) outstrips the supply (1%), the big holders of BTC will begin to sell their stockpiles because the price has reached a point where it makes sense for them to. As this adoption starts to happen, you will see the wealth begin to transfer from the early adopters to the mainstream majority.

I see this presented as a problem all the time, yet it seems like such a simple one to fix. Simply add the ability in all Bitcoin clients so that you have the option to immediately re-buy the amount of bitcoin you're spending at time of purchase. Problem solved. You're then spending bitcoin without actually losing your "stash" or its accumulated value.

The answer is that **right now**, bitcoin doesn't **need** to be a store of value. It's a means of exchange, and with that definition, it's undeniable. Who ever said that for bitcoin to valid, it needs to be a store of value? In the same vein, who ever said that bitcoin is money? 
Bitcoin is a digital means of exchange, and that's all it needs to be right now in order to succeed. In the future, when sovereign nations begin to adopt it as legal tender and put their faith behind it, it'll already be at the point where its value, market cap and volatility are proportionally in line with what we consider to be a stable store of value today. Maybe at that point, Krugman will finally concede that yes, bitcoin is in fact "money".

I've thought about this also, but it may become more trouble than it's worth (for example, imagine having to re-authenticate every time you want to send small amounts... it can become a pain real fast).
Instead, I came up with two alternative methods:
1. Allow the user to set a "threshold" for additional level of authentication to kick in. For example, if I make any transfers of $1000+, ask for 2nd authentication. Every user can set their own threshold, thereby alleviating annoying 2nd auth requests for small purchases.
2. Alternatively to 2nd authentication, instead implement a timed delay where the transaction can be canceled. Again, this would be set by the user. For example, on any transfer of over $1000, send me an email and SMS notification, and don't send the money for 12 hours. During those 12 hours, I can cancel the transfer.
I believe that either (or both) of these would add a tremendous amount of security and allow users to feel much safer about their money in Coinbase's hands. Thoughts?

Before I reply to your post, I just want to ask - what's your purpose? You made your account 6 months ago and in that time amassed a whopping -2000 karma through commenting very regularly. I've skimmed through your posts, and you are so blindly anti-bitcoin that it almost seems like you are paid to do this. If you're not being paid, then I wonder what you're still doing here if you hate this technology so much. It's one thing to intelligently critique something that you have interest in, it's another to stalk a subreddit that you obviously hate so much that you do nothing other than blindly berate anyone in it.
Now, as for your comment. Noone is saying that 7000 transactions a day is going to change the world. If it was, Bitcoin's price would be a lot higher than $1000. But you can't deny the fact that a year ago, BitcoinStore may have had 4 sales for the entire **week** as opposed to the 4 per hour this year. Next year, if it has 4 per minute, what would you say then? What if it's 4 per second the year after that?

World GDP is closing in on $100 trillion. There is a little less than $10 trillion in active circulation, although that's only 8-10% of actual wealth (the rest is stored in electronic mediums), which again equals close to $100 trillion.
If Bitcoin were to account for 2.5% of the world's wealth / GDP, you'd hit the $2.5 trillion that you're talking about. Will it happen? Who knows, but 2.5% is not exactly some astronomical number. Neither is 10%.

What's the harm? All the major exchanges have APIs so that your client never has your actual login info, just a token. And I'm sure if this was ever implemented in clients, it would be opt-in, so if you don't want to have this ability, just don't use it.

Many reasons - no credit card fees (for some merchants this can be a huge amount), greater security for the customer, no chargebacks, many people don't like to walk around with cash in their pockets, etc etc.
We have a furniture store, and we're greatly considering using bitcoin as many of our customers like to pay in cash to get a slight discount, but hate walking around with several thousand in their pockets.

I also personally think that the word Satoshi is too un-American and/or un-European (lets face it, US and Europe are two very large factors in the adoption of Bitcoin). It also strikes me as too nerdy of a name. If Bitcoin is to have mainstream support, it needs to have units of measure that have mainstream appeal.

This is a great idea. If you're using Coinbase to handle the transaction, can you also add an opt-in feature where the user can immediately repurchase the BTC amount spent on the Amazon purchase? Coinbase has an API to allow purchasing through a security token, and this would alleviate many people's concern of losing their 'stash' of coins.

The number that really jumps out at me is that they had just 99 transactions on Black Friday last year, which was their largest day of 2012. In the grand scheme of things, 6,300 transactions isn't going to rock the ecommerce world, but when you compare the year-over-year increase, you really get a sense for how rapidly bitcoin is being adopted both by merchants and consumers.

These guys are the poster boys for why mainstream media sucks, and why most people in the US have a very limited and skewed view of the world. He makes Coinbase sound like they wanted to steal his identity, and Localbitcoins like a shady drug deal. Then one of them asks what the "bitcoin effect" is, to which they say very matter-of-factly, "the black market for criminal activities".
Then they bring in some totally random CEO of some random company I've never heard of, and they ask him "Does bitcoin matter to you", and he goes, "Until we can figure it out, it doesn't matter at all to us." The woman then proceeds to say "Well, there you have it, bitcoin doesn't matter".

I'm more fascinated by his relentless devotion. Downvote after downvote and he just keeps on trucking.

It's obvious that he has several accounts that he uses to upvote his own posts.

Pretty simple once you get your head around it:
The chart explains the value of what one bitcoin will be worth in one year. The y axis is peak potential penetration (eg, 1% of global demand? 5%? 10%? 20%?), and the x axis is how many years will it take to reach that peak penetration.
So, for example, if it takes bitcoin 1 year to reach 20% of global demand (which currently is $13 trillion), then one bitcoin will be worth $208,141 a year from now. However, if it takes 10 years to achieve 20% demand, then one bitcoin will be worth $20,814 in one year.
Similarly, if bitcoin's peak penetration is 5%, and it takes 10 years to get there, then one bitcoin will only be worth $5,204 in one year.
Honestly though, this chart is all kinds of flawed, for many, many reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:25:37
I don't understand this guy's math. He says the gold market is somewhere around $1.5 trillion, but from my knowledge, I believe it's closer to $9 trillion. Also, while gold is a good store of wealth, it is not what most people use. To rely on gold's value alone to estimate bitcoin's potential as a store of wealth sells it very short.
A lot of his other numbers don't make sense either. He says 10% of ecommerce sales is $5 billion, but in the 3rd quarter of 2013, total ecommerce sales approached $70 billion. Also, bitcoin is not restricted to just ecommerce (as we've seen from lots of brick &amp; mortars accepting it). Retail sales in the 3rd quarter were $1.2 **trillion**. And both these numbers - retail and ecommerce - are **just** in the United States. As we all know, bitcoin is a global currency and the numbers are much higher when you include the rest of the world.
He also does not go into other sectors at all - real estate? auto sales (Tesla)? travel / entertainment (ticket to space)? etc etc.
It essentially boils down to the fact that this guy is very, very off on a lot of his numbers.

They replied specifically to the Bitcoin suggestion with " They also had a similar thing to say about it on twitter a week or so ago when someone asked. I think it's safe to say they are in the process of trying to implement it, or at the very least see it in their internal roadmap.

7000 is tiny compared to 99? The current price of Bitcoin ($1100) may also be considered "tiny" in 10 years. The point here is that the price of Bitcoin is rising more or less in line with the rate of spending that BitPay is seeing.
Also, BitPay clearly said that Black Friday was the highest transaction day in the history of Bitcoin. You're comparing one day to an entire month?

Really? In what way? Economists have wanted a worldwide currency since WW2 and it almost happened (look up Bancor). The IMF has been talking about the need for a worldwide digital currency for the greater part of the last decade. In some 3rd world / emerging countries, a currency like bitcoin could realistically be adopted. Zimbabwe **abandoned** their currency after hyperinflation made it worthless, and currently have **no** state-sponsored currency. How many other countries live with unstable currencies that could be debased at any moment? More than you think.
The point is that it's very shortsighted to say that it's a fantasy for a nation to one day make bitcoin legal tender. And if you're willing to accept that statement, you can then see how other similar countries would follow suit, each country larger than the last. Will the US ever adopt it? Europe? Who knows, but these first-world countries would certainly be the last to, not the first.

Actually to be honest I'm a little concerned. Thousands of mom-and-pop stores accepting bitcoin is one thing. Having a major internet outlet do it is another. If TigerDirect is the first, and it doesn't do well for them, it can lead to a lot of negative press. I really hope we're not jumping the gun and that the bitcoin economy is ready to support a retailer on the scale of TigerDirect.

This will instantly add substantial legitimacy to bitcoin. Overstock.com is a major player and a very well known brand, with sales of over $1 billion/year. Their stock is up almost 100% this year.

Just rebuy whatever you spend. If you're purchasing something for .5BTC, simply go to your exchange / broker and simultaneously buy .5BTC to compensate, thereby keeping your "stash" of equal value.
In this way, you're essentially spending the same amount as before, but helping the BTC community without hurting your savings.

This would be a setting on a user-by-user basis. If you don't want limits, just don't enable it on your account. It would be an opt-in setting for each user, and if a user opts-in, the specific limits would be able to be set at any value that makes sense to that user.
Also, I see this more of a withdrawal safeguard than an instant-buy safeguard, although I guess it would be good to have a setting for instant-buy limits as well.

Wow, we posted at almost the same time :) ... definitely gonna go read yours, now. 
I don't want to go back and re-read his analysis, but are you sure he multiplied by 5 for the rest of the world? I remember him saying $5bn of the $15bn market cap was derived from 10% of e-commerce sales (thereby meaning e-commerce is $50bn). However, e-commerce sales were $67bn for 3Q 2013 in the United States alone. So if that $5bn is actually the entire world (or $1bn for the US), then the numbers he's throwing out are even more ridiculous. Is he insinuating that total US e-commerce sales are $5bn?

Just to give a little background - this guy is the president of the Richmond district of the Fed (there are 12 districts). His district is the 2nd largest by assets held, only behind the NY district. Richmond is also the district where the Board of Governors is located. 
For those that can't watch the video, it's a pretty short bit (about 30 seconds). He pretty happily says that it's a free market and he doesn't see any reason for the Fed to intervene with bitcoin. He calls it "private money" and infers that for the market share to go up, the value needs to have less volatility.

No. Circulation is not at all the same as value or worth. For example, the net worth (after all debts, etc) of the US alone is close to $100 trillion. Worldwide, the number is much higher. 
Circulation refers only to money that is being transacted with at a certain given point in time. For example, Bitcoin's market cap is over $10 billion currently, but only a fraction of that is actually being transacted with. The rest is being held, tied up in assets, etc. If the market cap of Bitcoin were to reach $10 trillion, you could bet that the "circulation" would only be in the tens or low hundreds of billion, still much less than the almost $1 trillion in circulation with dollars.
