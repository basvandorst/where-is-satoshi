yeah they are , when i first bought ETH/LTC i had no clue what they were and just bought them cause i figured they would go up over time. I just recently
started researching different type of cryptos back in june of this year and now my portfolio consists of 7 or 8 different ones with BTC ETH and LTC containing the largest % of my portfolio. it’s crazy i’ve been buying since early 2014 but just recently started to actually gain interest in it , wish i started researching earlier but i’m happy with where i’m at right now

i forsure lost money on it, i sold it when it was about $380/coin, and i just checked my purchase history on coinbase and i was buying chunks of 0.05-0.1 at prices of 400-800 and only got a good deal of .15 at like 230. I remember now though I needed cash asap which is why i ended up selling lol. Learned my lesson though and when LTC/ETH was added onto coinbase I bought a fair amount at decent price and still hold to this day and plan on for a while
