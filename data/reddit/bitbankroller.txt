(Quick Summary)
During the Yunqi conference focused on big data and cloud computing in Shanghai, Alipay announced that they are likely to supply a cloud service platform based on blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology has brought great influence on financial industry. People believe that it will start a ‘bank revolution’ for a new credit system is constructing.
Blockchain technology is an open ledger, it’s decentralized, transparent. Bitcoin transactions are basing on blockchain.
More and more financial platforms are working on the research of blockchain technology, Nasdaq, Barkley......
Blockchain allows people to create smart contracts and wait for the contracts to be validated automatically.
Right now is still the early stage of blockchain technology, imagination and innovation are everywhere, maybe there will be more implement in mutual insurance and crowdfunding business.

Nope, not a ponzi. One year of operation and counting, satisfied investors throughout
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:38:30
Yes, thats if  the loans last for a year. Which they do not, because to this date they have all been repaid in their lending period. We are actively working on getting those statements clearer on the site especially in English. The site has been operating for a year and has successfully crowdfunded more than 10 projects, all loans have been repaid and interest delivered without delays.
 
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:18:48
Update: Due to Extremely high demand 500 btc were added to the crowfund goal. The 500 btc were funded in 3 minutes!

Jua.com the premier crowdfunding site of the Chinese Bitcoin community is announcing its latest crowdfunding project. Jua.com will purchase the Yihang mining farm in Inner Mongolia and will build a new mining farm in Sichuan province. These mines will be able to produce 12 petahash and around 100 btc per day. Fund Raising Goal: 5000btc，Lending period: 150 days，1.60% monthly interest，The crowd funding will begin on August 4th.
Transcript of the video announcement on Youtube:
Hello, I'm Ying Wang the marketing director at jua.com. The last crowd funding project was a total success and was profitable. All the bitcoins were returned and investors received their interest payments as promised. The details of the project's profits will soon be shown on our new website. This time, the investors who funded the last project will be able to immediately invest without the risk of missing out when the crowd funding begins. Jua.com crowd funding projects are extremely popular in the Chinese bitcoin community, crowd funding goals are usually reached within hours. Therefore, this is very advantageous for people who regularly invest at Jua.com.
The rising cost of electricity and the mining difficulty have been a major challenge for mining bitcoins. Because of china’s low electricity cost in rural regions we are able to produce bitcoins at a significantly lower cost. We are very excited to announce a new crowd funding project. We will purchase the Yihang mining farm in Inner Mongolia and will build a new mining farm in Sichuan province. These mines will be able to produce 12 petahash and an average of 100 btc per day.
Fund Raising Goal:5000btc，Lending period:150 days， 1.60% daily interest，This crowd funding will begin on August 4th, 2015.

Get it on overstock.com, ships worldwide and they accept btc
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:46:29
Absolutely correct. Hence the "around" a 100 btc per day. And in the video statement "an average of 100 btc per day". Investing in Mining is booming in China now, these rural regions offer amazingly cheap electricity, and we are building near water sources to reduce electricity even more.

Good question. Ill get back to you on that.
@_date: 2015-08-24 09:05:39
I dont think the article was focused on Bitcoin in China so much. More like the global state of Bitcoin from the perspective of someone in China.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:05:55
My mistake, but this is the real deal. To be honest I didnt believe it myself. It is 1.60% daily interest on the principle lent, daily, delivered to lenders wallets at 12pm Beijing time everyday until the loan is repaid. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:37:48
says they target Western users, link is in chinese...fail.

As the professor of the Intro to digital currency told us, very few times in history do you have the opportunity to participate in an industry that never existed before and has the potential to change the world. Once I realized this I did everything I could to make a career in Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:58:42
Thanks for the encouragement. It is 1.6% daily interest on the principle delivered to lenders wallets everyday at 12pm Beijing time until the loan is repaid. Today's lenders will receive their first interest payment tomorrow August 5th at 12pm.

First off, thank you for your investigative skills and for pointing this out, you helped us clear up alot things here.
Normally the users having the same first and last letter or number is usually the case. Here in China it is common for people to use their email or phone number as their username. For example "1...5" is really several people with phone numbers that start with 1 and end with 5. All numbers here start with 1.  "S...M" is actually several people with emails that start with S and end with M, as most emails end with ".com". With most of the accounts you listed this is the case.
Another reason is that on our platform users can invest from 2 accounts in the system. A "Balance" account and from a "interest bearing" account and this will also register as 2 users on the list.
However as you suspected and after discussing it further with our technical team there were 2 users that did use robots the first one and the fourth one on your list. They were contacted and admitted so.
Good eye, your efforts are much appreciated.

The complete quote
"I believe the incentives for the mainstream to use bitcoin are still in the early stage. The tools for regular people to use bitcoin are rapidly being developed, and I think we are entering a stage in bitcoin’s history where we will see mass adoption soon."
By soon I mean in 1 or 2 years and by mass adoption I mean exponentially more people using BTC than now. I tell people the same thing all the time, no one knows about BTC and its been covered on the media so much. I think this is a pivotal moment in Bitcoin's history were it will begin to be utilized by a whole new wave of people due to a chain of events both positive and negative in many regions of the world.
Yes this price is awesome, to see it back over $1000 after  the events of 2014 and 2015 and stay there the last month or so has been immensely satisfying.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:06:48
Yea 2 weeks, lol. But theres alot of momentum these last few weeks, seems like a snowball effect of events.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:39:34
No problem. Indeed,  false narratives can snowball immediately, especially in regards to BTC in China

The miner is called the BW L21. Its currently planned for domestic release and possible international release. These miners are designed to mine the script algorithm that LTC and other coins run on. BW is committed to Litecoin development and has been designing/producing LTC miners for 2 years and maintains one of the worlds largest LTC mining facilities. Here is a video of our LTC mining facility starting at 3 minute mark.

Thanks for the encouraging words Vaultoro!
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:45:27
Who are "core" in your opinion? As it seems many people have their interpretation. At the time the signatories were under the impression that the developers were in fact representing the group of the developers who work on Bitcoin Core. That later turned out not to be the case and the developer signatories did not follow up with the rest of signatories once they knew they could not fulfill their commitment. There's been enough chiding, no need to add more. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 20:02:43
BW is not an "intimate mate" of Bitmain, we are their largest competitor in China, lol

BW is proud to officially announce its latest Bitcoin ASIC chip, the BW-LK1401. This groundbreaking technological feat is the first generation 14nm ASIC mining chip in the industry and comes on the back of nearly a year of research and development in collaboration with Samsung.
The power consumption of the BW-LK1401 chip is 160W/T, which makes it the lowest in the industry. Building on this technology the second generation 	            BW-LK1402 chips are currently in production with a lower power consumption of   95 W/T.  BW ASIC chips make use of the most advanced manufacturing technology and optimized design leading to increased hash power, lower power consumption and greater stability. 
BW is devoted to producing and providing competitive Bitcoin miners through technical innovation for all Bitcoin enthusiast and entrepreneurs and we are pleased to make these high performance miners available to the public in April.

Because "Core" means many things to many people, it was not clear and still is not clear who are "core". A false assumption was made by the signatories that the devs in the room were leaders of "core" and would have the sufficient influence and commitment to fulfill the agreement. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 08:20:21
We look forward to having our miners perform in comparison tests to confirm our claims.

Suspicious of what? LK Group (BW predecessor) was established in 2013, BW in 2014. "Partied" that means nothing.

Yes we did. It was our last batch last year, the efficiency was slightly better, however we were expecting much better performance to release to the public. That on top of demand from our pre-order clients lead us to sell out our early batches. Heres the announcement of the chips being sold out in April of last year:

Fiat money is used for ulterior motives more than Bitcoin today. Cash is a tool, people can use it for good or bad. The advantages are not easily learned therefore they must be taught and be made easy to use, which is happening today. Perhaps Bitcoin will die, it is a possibility, but if it did not die in its first few years I think it has a much better chance of continuing to grow today.

Thanks for your interest in Bitbank. I am not sure why it has all that invasive stuff. I will find out tomorrow, I will be advocating to remove as many of those settings as possible and make the app more privacy friendly. It comes back to culture differences, in China privacy is not as important to as many people as in the West. So the apps usually go overboard with the control privileges. You bringing this to our attention is greatly appreciated. If you have any other questions or concerns please let us know.

We are legit. Here is a brief intro to our company for your review:

Bitbank is now constructing a mining facility that will be equipped with the world’s only 14nm miners. Bitbank will be responsible for the BTC raised to deploy and construct the Xinjiang mining facility which will produce around 30 petahash of hashing power. The principal of users who participate in the crowd fund will be 100% returned at the end of the project. Bitbank ensures the investment due to the low power cost in the facility. The facility will be run by our professional staff 24 hours a day. Bitbank has organized over 20 stable and rewarding crow funds for users over the last 2 years. Bitbank believes in the long term growth of Bitcoin and is committed to providing users reliable investment opportunities that will satisfy investor’s expectations.

BW does care about safety, you make excellent points and I will communicate them to the datacenter. 14nm miners will be available in January, final production is under way. Please check out some [Specs]( here.

Yes, unfortunately they could only fit a few in the article.
@_date: 2016-05-09 10:11:19
Yes, we had internal discussions about this name. We are well aware of the disdain many in the Bitcoin community have for banks in the West. However, Bitbank is a China based company, here people did not go through the shock of 2008 and are less critical of the financial system in general (though that is changing). Through this deliberation we also thought about new people who come to bitcoin, and for them the name has a different impression as it is a concept they are used to. So we are aiming to be a new kind of bank where users are able to see the transparency of our service and can hold their funds securely while enjoying the benefits of the products we offer.

Yep, it is.

Thanks everyone for the support! [here are some more pics of the mining farm and office] ( Any questions or inquiries please let me know here or can email at Virgilio
@_date: 2015-10-23 01:45:55
Hello, yes that was me that commented. I did tell them Winter 2016 as I thought that referred to this upcoming winter. My mistake. Yes, its unfortunate that the mining industry has such a poor record when it comes to delivery. I'm glad to hear your lketc miners are still functioning, the same team were involved in the 14nm projects.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:23:38
For context, the question was framed asking if BTC was used as a medium of exchange in China.
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:44:44
These photos were taken early on in the construction of the mining farm that particular warehouse could have been empty at that time. It doesnt seem clear its empty from that angle though.
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:54:11
That would also be a hell of a trip to Inner Mongolia to see some noisy rigs. This info has been shared in the Chinese bitcoin scene for months.
@_date: 2015-10-13 05:24:29
Very good eye. That particular mining farm in Inner Mongolia is using 28nm chips.

LK Group Limited and BW are definitely legitimate. LK Group Limited is one of the largest Bitcoin mining manufacturers in the world and has delivered miners to customers globally.

The hesitance and distrust of pre-orders is completely understood. Rest assured that BW as the  hash producer overall accounting for 8% of the network in the world and  Cloud mining provider in China will continue to live up to the reputation of reliability and quality service it has earned in the domestic market. BW looks forward to bringing the same level of service to the international market.   [Please take a look at some pics of the office and mining farm]( and heres our recent [article in Bitcoin Magazine]( introducing the history and business of BW.

Im gonna look into this further. Glad to hear your miner is still producing for you.
@_date: 2015-10-22 16:42:28
Hello, the 14nm miners will be launched this coming winter. Pre-order funds will be used to expedite the customers order. BW sees this an opportunity to introduce itself to the international Bitcoin community and is committed to continuing to fulfill its responsibilities to its valued customers.

Yes, the photo is shopped.  The reason it was altered was to blur the critical information on the chip

Thanks for your interest in Bitbank. I am not sure why it has all that invasive stuff. I will find out tomorrow, I will be advocating to remove as many of those settings as possible and make the app more privacy friendly. It comes back to culture differences, in China privacy is not as important to as many people as in the West. So the apps usually go overboard with the control privileges. You bringing this to our attention is greatly appreciated. If you have any other questions or concerns please let us know.

Hello All,
To clarify, Mr. Guo's comments and actions do not represent Bitbank or BW. Mr. Guo operates a variety of projects independently, an ETH mining facility is one of them. Which is what he is referring to in his comments.
The CEO of Bitbank and founder of chbtc.com the top eth trading exchange in China and arguably the world, Mr. Songxiu Hua looks forward to the Ethereum foundation presenting measures to the community that are conducive to the interests of the majority as well as the development of Ethereum.
Please review the updated version of the coindesk article.

nice round up, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:30:28
What miners are you referring to that breached the agreement? Because I would argue its the developer signatories that breached the agreement. Please stop generalizing and provide the specific information where you think which miner signatory breached the agreement. We at BW stuck to the HK agreement to the letter.

Those two examples are questionable and are only TWO signatories out of the 11 miners who signed. Instead of any follow up or attempts to resolve the supposed issues there was a smear campaign begun on the mining industry particularly miners based in China as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:53:20
BW would like to reiterate its commitment to the New York Agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:45:41
Nakamoto Consensus will ultimately trump the political problems in the scaling debate. I was referring to the signatories of the HK agreement when it came to resolving the breaches they claimed by some parties of the agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:21:22
You make strong strong assumptions on many fronts and twist the intentions of some players in this debate. You are correct that Bitcoin means alot to many people, Bitcoin also represents different things to different people. Nakamoto Consensus is what got Bitcoin to its current level of success and it's what will continue to drive its future success.

I suggest Daniel Kelman crypto lawyer. He's a hardass and will work hard
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:31:54
Meaning the longest chain with the most work will prevail. The dye is cast with the HK agreement, and the players have chosen their paths. Theres no going back

I've explained it as clearly as I can. We're all users, "users" (all of us) want a Bitcoin that works.

Miners are "terrorists" now? This hick is unhinged.
