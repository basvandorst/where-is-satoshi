could u tell us when the splitting service will be available relative to the time of fork?  i.e. 1 day later, 2 days, etc

lol, it's not about how i  WANT it.  it's about how B2x IS BITCOIN, CAME FROM BITCOIN, and is even CLAIMING to be BITCOIN.  
so does that mean i can claim capital losses since BTC went down after the fork?  gotta give to get.

actually, if you look at the futures market of BTC (BT1 and BT2), it's showing that BTC will only be worth ~85% of its value after the fork and the other 15% going to BT2.

i dont know about shitcoins.  i'm talking about converting BT2 (B2X) back to BT1 (BTC).  look at the futures market and BT2 taking away from BT1.  both BTC.

lol, selling B2X whose value CAME from BTC to convert it BACK to BTC should NOT be taxed.  you realize how stupid it would be to tax it right?

oh, it isn't BTC YET it's forking off with 15% of BITCOIN's value.  talks like a duck, WALKS like a duck.  MEANING your BTC asset goes down because 15% of its value went to B2X which is ALSO bitcoin.  hmm, makes sense, right?  you're obviously a trader and not a bitcoiner, dude.  if you can't see this logic, stop responding and save us both the time.

no, it only makes sense to someone who doesn't understand VALUE.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:38:37
you obviously know jack.  blocked.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:07:05
how can it be a profit if it took away value from your investment?  makes ZERO sense.
