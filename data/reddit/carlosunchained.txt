Hmm, neither in Spain but GDAX allowed me to transfer somehow to and from BCH/€ account, which has no trades. Either way the time on shapeshift expired so I’m waiting for the refund on the account. Maybe shapeshift didn’t receive anything because of that, but my BCH is gone from GDAX so...

I agree, fuck Coinbase, but if I can sell my bcash I'll do it.

I transfered it to GDAX and I'm dealing with shapeshif to change it for bitcoins. Why wait if the price is pumped now?

Where does the coinbase price comes from? It never catches gdax unless gdax is again a few points above. I couldn’t find any pattern.

Where to sell it??

It seems I can't use gemini from my country due to 2 factor authentication. Is there a way to skip this?

I convinced my gf to purchase some bitcoins in late 2015 the same time I first bought. We’ve been purchasing together since then.

I do have Authy, I use it for Coinbase. The issue comes when I want to enter the phone number, Gemini doesn't support my country.

I have a small amount on coinbase I bought for 1/10 the price it is right now, should I keep holding? I kind of want to buy more but it’s not going to be near to $450/btc anytime... 
Maybe sell now and buy more than the first investment when a low hits?

It’s a small amount. I know the risks but it’s easier to have them there. The only thing I’m not sure if sell or keep or buy.

Is it better to remove funds out of coinbase until all of this drama ends?
