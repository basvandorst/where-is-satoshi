I think you misspelled hodling

..and what I am supposed to do, living in a poor country with not so great salary meanwhile the BTC Ship floats away with double bi-turbo and I do not even have the ticket

I know LTC would make me cum if i would go few months ago. I know ETH would too. But damn, I dont have a fucking time machine !
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:58:18
yes, this morning waking up to 9,7 k.. I started feeling the urge to FUCKING DO SOMETHING, I cannot wait until half of the december for next fucking salary.. "go big or die poor if u didnt woke up early to the crypto scene"?

If it fails and I lose my money, I can pay it off, in four years. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:54:44
I made it on my mac, with bootable Linux, with non-wireless printer. Should be enough, right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:02:42
How you are so sure it is 'end of the bubble' ? :D 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:06:26
I dont need to say the reason. 
I would pay in total 11000 - 11200
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:04:48
Im considering it. I probably will. 
Im thinking about actually having balls for first time in my life. And not eating ~~them~~ one of them at 10k lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:23:57
'close friend who you can plausibly kill' made me chuckle at the office :-D
anyways, isn't a cold wallet created in offline env enough?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:17:47
Really? At this early  adoption you think its going to crash? I mean.. Correction is for sure in front of us, but to what.. 9k? 8.8k ? I want to GRAB THE CORRECTION BY THE BALLS AND SQUEEZE THEM

Can I ask what color your tesla will be?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:33:06
This is throwaway account, but not troll.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:56:51
wow, but u still can cash in afterwards ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:59:54
I can pay it of relatively safely in four years. Thats the worst case scenario.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:02:44
But I do understand what ur trying to point out.
Myself, when im introducing someone to crypto, I everytime say that they shouldn'tinvest more than they are willing to lose
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:03:44
Okay, maybe its not so huge after all, just.. For me as a young and non-rich parents person its a nice amount.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:59:26
Yes, I can cover that loan with my salary, in 4 years. ( In case the BTC would not come out in positive )
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:59:11
thanks for the motivation! I am about to discuss it with two of my friends that are in this market for a way longer time than myself ; however I'm almost certain I will do it. And I want to do it on the closest correction that is on our way towards us. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:15:26
I never took a loan. Is that much? I find it myself very beneficial, I mean, the 140 euro or whatever I will pay more, its not so much in the long run..
