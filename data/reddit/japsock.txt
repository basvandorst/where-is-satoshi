I'm sure the dude willing to put $200k into bitcoin needs a random guy on reddit to tell him what to do. Especially a comment with no relevance to his question.

Broke up with volume confirmation, nice TA bro

you're right, I'm dumb, but didn't the bfx tokens get redeemed for tether?

I mean I will never understand why people make these bets and mascarade it as "investing". No, this was a pure gamble not much different from putting $85k on green. The people who gambled on b1x won and b2x lost. The odds were super stacked against him.
Unlucky, I guess.

The whale/s who had 10k btc buywalls @ 0.5 on polo and kraken must feel pretty special right now

Zzz, are you so pathetic and sad that all you can do is iterate what I just said to you?

You get a bcc wallet, import your private key, done.

When you pay in a store with bitcoin your BTC will be worth $2323 instead of $2600 like the price is now. That's the whole issue. So your bitcoin is worth 10% less than it should be, as in if you buy something for $2323 you're getting fucked out of $270.

It was like 10-15% when the year started. Now it's probably 75%, and I haven't put any new money into it.
