The fact that mt.gox halted trading is pretty concerning as well.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:17:45
That's probably because they are basing it on a $135 / BTC price from when they halted trading.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:02:10
Not true.  The chinese governemnt is fundamentally opposed to bitcoin.  It is the most likely candidate to stop the transfer of the global economony from being pegged on the US dollar over to Chinese Yuan.  Probably also why the US is moving towards regulating it and embracing it.

"Why would I buy MtGox's problems when I could build an exchange for far less? Their only asset is an angry customer base."
I completely agree.  I think it's going to be incredibly tough to find someone to acquire Mt.Gox.  It's extremely likely that their mess has grown too big for an acquisition to be a worthy investment.

If they made so much in the past, wouldn't they attempt to protect that revenue stream?  Why let the whole thing go to shit?

You clearly don't get it and you aren't absorbing the comments that Marc Andreesen was making.  As bitcoin goes more mainstream, they wouldn't even consider adopting DarkSend.  DarkSend is about anonymity.  For bitcoin to go truly mainstream it will need to stay away from features like this.  There will always be a need for this kind of coin, most likely used by the fringe, or activities in the grey area or that might be downright illegal.   Bitcoin will move far past providing services that help this, however Darkcoin is building features that appeal to these market "needs".  They say that 20% of global commerce is on the blackmarket.  Bitcoin won't be used for that as it gets bigger, trust me.

Facebook targets financial services
By Sally Davies, Duncan Robinson and HannahKuchler
Not content with being just a platform to host cat photos and status updates, Facebook is readying itself to provide financial services in the form of remittances and electronic money.
The social network is only weeks away from obtaining regulatory approval in Ireland for a service that would allow its users to store money on Facebook and use it to pay and exchange money with others, according to several people involved in the process.

The authorisation from Ireland’s central bank to become an “e-money” institution would allow Facebook to issue units of stored monetary value that represent a claim against the company. This e-money would be valid throughout Europe via a process known as “passporting”.
Facebook has also discussed potential partnerships with at least three London start-ups that offer international money transfer services online and via smartphones: TransferWise, Moni Technologies and Azimo, according to three people involved in the discussions.
In the case of Azimo, Facebook offered to pay the company $10m to recruit one of its co-founders as a director of business development, according to people familiar with the situation. A Facebook spokesperson said the company did not comment on “rumour and speculation”.
London’s financial technology sector has thrived thanks to the high concentration of financial services companies, a congenial timezone for international transactions and a more unified regulatory environment in Europe compared with the US.
A foray into migrant remittances is part of Facebook’s push to increase its presence in emerging markets.
“Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion,” said a person familiar with the company’s strategy. Facebook recently passed 100m users in India, which is its largest national market outside the United States.
But it is unclear that people will trust Facebook to handle their money, given concerns about personal data mining by the social media network to boost advertising on the site.
Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion
The money transfer project, led by Sean Ryan, Facebook’s vice-president of platform partnerships, signals a strategic shift for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising.
It also comes as other internet groups – in particular, China’s Tencent and Alibaba – race to turn their sites into mobile payment platforms.
Google has reiterated its commitment to expanding its mobile payments and wallet products, which have yet to be widely adopted by consumers. It is registered in the UK to issue electronic money, in a process similar to the authorisation which Facebook is seeking in Ireland.
Obtaining an e-money authorisation in Ireland would require Facebook to hold capital of €350,000 and segregate funds equivalent to the amount of money it has issued, according to legal experts.
Facebook is already authorised for some forms of money transfer in the United States, allowing it to process payments for developers who charge users for in-app purchases.
In 2013, the company facilitated $2.1bn worth of transactions, almost exclusively from games, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Facebook takes a fee of up to 30 per cent for such payments, and these fees account for about 10 per cent of its revenues.
Vodafone has acquired an e-money licence for the phone company to operate financial services in Europe.
“It’s great news that non-banks are challenging the traditional banking monopoly,” said Simon Deane-Johns, a UK-based lawyer and European payments expert at law firm Keystone Law.

I've seen this situation happen plenty of times in the online poker world and online sportsbetting world.  I can't really think of a situation where a company has halted withdrawals for an extended period of time and pulled through to make good to all their customers.  In almost every situation I can think of the company has gone on to fail.  The customers have always gotten screwed because the companies didn't have segregated accounts for player funds and operating funds.  They just don't have an incentive to do so in an unregulated environment.  I don't see how MtGox would be any different.

Nobody is gonna throw around $1.5M on some bullshit hoax thread.  As much as I hate Gox, I'd make a bet (however not a large one) that gox will come out with some reasonable news on Monday.  It's more likely that someone knows they'll be able to get some coins, rather than someone is pump and dumping for coins they can never pull out.  Unless of course it's gox behind the trade.

For anyone wondering what is really happening in regards to the recent price spike (see below).  For a moment people were thinking withdrawals were back on, and others were mis-informing the rest hoping to pump up prices.  Basically everyone freaked out over nothing. 
From Gmaxwell on bitcoin talk:
"No, withdraws are not happening. MTGox has continually thorough the shutdown made a small number of what appear to be dust-cleanup transactions. Thats all these appear to be... Ironically, someone of them like TXID: ed7ffa58fef651adaf1281ad10e98a4399eb2be40950345c7ccb7c8f76f067e1 in their liast are spending immature coinbases (45d45286bac04311684ab7716ab170b50781cde6b094d9a644fb89ca07ae6888:31 is a coinbase with 67 confirms as I write this) and so it's not a valid transaction.

So it's not possible for a board member of the bitcoin foundation to mismanage his company?  FTP at it's peak was valued at over a billion dollars, generating $1.4m per day in revenue back in 2010 (according to Forbes).  The business model of an online poker site is very similar to that of a trading exchange.  You seem to place Mark Karpeles on a pedestal, and dismiss any comparison to FTP as absurd simply because you believe he's making too much money and that since he sits on the board of the bitcoin foundation that he's no longer prone to human error or greed.

Based on Bobby Lee's interview and how he worded his answers with WSJ, my impression is the rumors are likely true.  The real issue is that China represents so much of the volume.  It will pull the floor out.  It's not like when Gox caused the crash.  That time there was a base of buyers to bring prices back up (China).  This time who turns it around?  
If the rumors are in fact true, then everyone on the Chinese exchanges is gonna run for the door, as it be truly important for them to get their money out as fast as possible.  I'm a long term believer in BTC.  But in the short term I think we're gonna see some very very low prices for a while.  Just my 2 cents.

OP of the thread offered to bring others on board his multi plaintiff lawsuit (specifically stating those with more than $10k at stake), only to receive such an overwhelming response that he had to extend a couple of days in order to line up who was going to go in on it.

One of the benefits for the those being sued in a class-action suit is that no one else can sue them for the same thing.  In Japan where they don't have class action suits (which is why this is a multi-plantiff suit), it can be much more costly in that this is just one lawsuit of many.  Publicity has nothing to do with the kind of lawsuit you make, it has to do with the news outlets wanting to publish the story.  I'm pretty certain there are going to be multiple lawsuits against Mt.Gox, it would seem logical with so much money at stake.  It will be interesting to see how all this pans out.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:18:51
No.  But I did take a short position after reading this.  However most of the reasoning for that, is the market over reacted with 10%+ gains after sniffing news that withdrawals *might* be being tested.  The Mt. Gox debacle is far from over, in fact I think it's gonna get nastier pretty quickly if this thread is true.  I'm pretty certain everything surrounding Mt.Gox will continue to strain the markets in the coming days.

If a government had seized Gox funds I could believe people would get funds back in a year.  Of course everyone would be pleased with this outcome.  As we are all fairly certain, the funds were stolen.  I guess I'm wondering what is the probability that a company like this can return to solvency, having such a tarnished image and incompetent management.  I'm using the FTP debacle as a point of reference.

On the other side, if someone knew something why would they just rip the market up when they can sit around and accumulate below $455 pretty easily?  It's also possible someone was covering a massive short position.  They figure with the 6 hour server upgrade that occured this morning, there's little downside left on monday.  The markets have already priced in the fact that Gox is incompetent or corrupt.  If the news is decent, you'll likely see a bump in prices.

What happened at FTP wasn't a ponzi scheme, they were comingling player funds with operating funds while they were running into cashout issues in order to keep the company operating and continue paying out shareholders.  This doesn't sound much different than what's happening at MtGox.  So let me ask you, are you are confident that MtGox has not been comingling trader and operating funds??  Their lack of transparency is troubling.  Why wouldn't they just show their coin balance as I've heard they've done in the past.  Wouldn't they at least owe that to their clients?  Or are they right to do nothing while they watch their clients BTC become worth less than half of that on other exchanges?  If I were running that company I wouldv'e quickly moved to show proof of funds at the very least to have costumers retain some sort of confidence in the company while we sort through the technical issues. That's just me though.
