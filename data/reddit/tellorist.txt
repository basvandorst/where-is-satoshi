whoa dude, since when is holding an asset gambling? let alone if it's a form of money? every investor tells you to diversify your portfolio, if at this point you don't own any bitcoin, you are pretty lazy if not reckless. the mechanism which made people trust this thing have been laid out for about a decade, calling it gambling is quite a stretch.

SM might be a controversial person, but cutting of finance to people expressing their views really is one huge reason why bitcoin was invented.

it still won't affect production long term - making it more secure is just making it more valuable. if you can't beat this thing by tech or trickery, all you have left is the social attack vector, which is why people talk shit about this all day long without realizing this thing won't magically go away.

“oh is it still a thing?” I usually use to make sure nobody starts thinking I have some btc.. you really don’t want to be the “he invested big in bitcoin” guy when another bullrun drops, cause of the many new “friends” you’re going to have..

confirmation bias. it goes up? it must have value. it's crashing? it's probably rubbish.

gold does not compete with bitcoin, one is modeled after the other to bring real value to the digital age, but they share the same basic idea.

not sure, coinbase banned red-ice.tv for political reasons, the U.S. is not a place for free speech anymore, just telling ya, cause I‘m a tellorist :)

you can't tax bitcoin, some 3rd party can't even prove you own any, only you can prove it, or deny having access to it. what you mean is when you convert it to fiat, and only when doing so with some kyc/aml exchange, they can tax you. if people used this how it was intended, barely anyone would move large sums through exchanges though. afaik none of the original cypher punks ever moved any of their coin to any exchange, not even for claiming free fork-coins. so there you go, take an example from the old dudes in this.

this. if you don't move your coins, or have not moved them in a while, making the case that you still own them really only becomes possible for a tyrannical regime, in which case a revolution and rolling heads will be needed anyways. only the owner can prove that one owns bitcoins, no third party can. bitcoin is rather difficult to handle, it's rather plausible to argue you could have sent them to a wrong address, one you don't control. only a tyrannical regime can torture you into admitting you own them, but at this point you better be armed and organized in vigilante militia anyways, cause if they need torture to make you admit you own something, while really they can't know whether you do or not, all odds are off anyways.
this is why I really like bitcoin, it's a genius design that incorporates all eventualities of human nature and layers of complex incentives, it's a game-theory masterpiece designed to unsettle the banking-elite. well done satoshi and devs. it will take another 10 years before everyone fully understood what this really is and why it is so special..

I don't think people really mind bitcoin's volatility on a long enough timeframe?

if you want any crypto to succeed, you need to get rid of the banking-mob first, globally. they don‘t like competition, and they don‘t like you to use proper non-debt-based money.

back when it was $300, more people minded minecraft than mining or buying bitcoin..

oh that‘s nothing compared to what happened to people who tried to exit the oppressive communist bolshevik central-banking system, namely saddam hussein, muhhamad gaddafi, bashar al assad, and last but not least adolf hitler.

they designed it like this so the zion mainframe would not overload while rendering our increasingly fake reality. it doesn’t have many pixels. they are struggling to keep reality credible, they glitch left and right, they even made everyone believe Epstein died, then they made “the elon” do a simple car for the masses...less rendering as I said :)

in other words: the game of fiat and central-banks is rigged.
