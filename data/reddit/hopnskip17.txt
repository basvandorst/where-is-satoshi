Still don't get it.... There never was a Satoshi!
He's fabricated and plays the puppet figure in everyone's imagination.
He was created by the entity that created Bitcoin to preserve their identity!

Oh ok. So he's the only guy in history that's unable to be located or tracked in this day and age??
Just think about that!

I've bought gold, it's a hedge, not an investment, almost never moves

Thank you, this I love! I'm excited because I don't need to accumulate 5 or 10 btc (which is simply unattainable for me) , I only need like a quarter of one and then to just sit and wait.
Really enjoyed viewing that page. Basically was the whole point to my post.
Cheers!

Great advice

Thank you, this was the exact point of my post. People dismiss buying now because some period only have a couple of hundred bucks to invest. But in actual fact that would be alot if it took over.
This is btc biggest obstacle moving forward, getting people to accept such a small fraction could actually become so relevant.

Remember the key word was "If"

Thanks for your response. I'll check them out. Is there a link to your comments on bitcoin.com wallet. I'd be interested in reading and learning. Cheers

Ain't that the truth!

I hope he's right.... I'd love another year long fire sale before the games begin!

The only issue still is point of sale. Until ease of use if figured out, it won't go mainstream. 
Anything longer than 2-3 seconds waiting for confirmed transactions in stores won't catch on.
Store of wealth is what we'll see

Any recommendations for Android?? I currently use the bitcoin.com mobile wallet. Appreciate any recommendations in advance :)

No. It's simply built on brand awareness.... Trust will always be the most important juncture for any wannabe competing coin. Trust takes time to build, years in fact.
Add the that the constant Hash power lead that btc has always maintained and it's simply not going to happen.
