1. Supply is unlimited only in theory, there is a built in difficulty bomb that will make it never, even in a billion years, pass the 100m supply limit. It is still up to debate what to do about it, but that is how it is now.
2. 100000000 tokens so far: how is that even relevant? That is just a number, it could be 10000000000000, it could be 37, the constant doesn't matter, only the inflation. How stupid you have to be to think the actual number is relevant?
3. It is much more decentralized than Bitcoin in absolutely every aspect imaginable. Mining: Bitcoin mining is essentially a single company by now... Ethereum's mining algorithm is ASIC resistant, basically 1 computer = 1 vote, as Satoshi wished. Mining is fully decentralized. Applications: Ethereum is built around the concept of decentralized applications, so everything is. Bitcoin is just a pseudo-decentralized coin, but every single popular app built on it is centralized (Satoshi Dice, etc.). Protocol: there are several concurrent full-node implementations - Geth, Eth, Parity, Pyethereum. The Ethereum Foundation is still the most influent, but by a small margin. Bitcoin is essentially Core, plus censure and propaganda in charge of everything.
4. "Fork" - so what? The community had a disagreement and split into 2 concurrent networks (ETC and ETH), what did you expect? That we spent the next 2 years debating about that change without ever taking an action while other coins evolve technologically? Oh...
