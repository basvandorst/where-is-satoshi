Isn't the 21 million coins limit a little bit dangerous?
Long-term a large part of coins will be lost eventually, we already lost half a million in the span of 4 years, that's a insane amount!
Also how is bitcoin supposed to be used as a means of payment? Who would pay with a deflationary currency? 
I think that the software should be recoded to reintegrate lost coins into the market, I'm not advocating an inflationary currency but an ideal currency is a currency with neither inflation neither deflation, if coins are lost then it becomes deflationary so something should be done about the lost coins? 
I'm thinking about the network removing the lost coins and reinject them into the market

Mark will liquidate them for cash? And how will he do that?
No market will be able to absorb so much bitcoins, have you seen that transaction in early february that crashed BTC-e to $102? It was only some 10 000 BTC, so liquidate 180 000 BTC would be something litterally impossible without crashing the markets significantly even if spread over several months...

Report this immediatly to anarchystar and Mr. Greene so that their lawyers take action and investigate on that.
We already did it for 200k BTC and Mark the thief was forced to admit they were somehow magically discovered, hence why he immediatly disabled the API when the judges asked him about those 200k BTC.

Also yes in pretty much all countries you need a license to demonstrate so that authorities are warned and can prepare in case of troubles.
Even if it's two guys, as long as it seems evident that they're protesting they do need a license.
At least Japan is more "democratic" than my country in which lone individuals can be arrested for just wearing anti-government shirts without even protesting. And yet my country is known to have brought the concept of "human rights" to this world, hurr durr

@_date: 2014-02-27 16:35:00
So what happened?
- Mark lost the private keys to the cold storage
- Someone took the private keys into hostage and asks Mark a ransom
- The feds seized the cold storage in order to investigate on SR case (some info on that was disclosed so it's possible)
I hope it's not the third option, who is gullible enough to think the feds would give back our coins after they investigate on SR and get the info they were looking for? 
The governement is anti-bitcoin and them having almost 900k BTC (750k + 144k) is a huge opportunity to take all the community into hostage and hamper bitcoin's future.

Deflationary is as bad as inflationary.
When the currency is inflationary, everyone will rush and buy goods with it because tomorrow their cash will be worth less than yesterday.
When it is deflationary, it's the contrary, people will keep waiting so that they'll be able to buy more goods in the future.
To me the fact that bitcoin is deflationary makes it more a good long-term investment or savings tool rather than a tool in which we can buy stuff with.
For instance I personally don't like using my precious bitcoins to buy stuff, I'd rather prefer spend fiat.

This still doesn't prove that he doesn't have the IDs.
He could tell you "I only searched in the database of IDs that were already sent", hence if you send him a fake email he will obviously not find it in the sold database.

If that is true then Mark Karpeles is truly a retard who doesn't even know how a company is supposed to be run.
Had anarchystar and his lawyer team not told the courts about the 200k BTC move, he would probably have never disclosed us this information.
Prolly he was trying to run away with the coins thinking that his 190 IQ will help him get away with the charges, but too bad for you Mark. 
You can fool one man with an IQ of 190 but you can't fool a whole community, now it's time for payback.
