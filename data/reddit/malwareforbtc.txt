Do not try to invest right now, another DIP is comming. It will crash to 4000.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:07:13
Who cares?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:36:00
Now is smart to sell, and rebuy at 4500, cause another DIP is coming. Just wait few days, DIP is almost here.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:38:09
Argumentum ad hominem... Also people want to hear: bitcoin will be 10000 or something like that, nobody likes bad news. If you dont want to see Dislike go to facebook.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:59:09
Smart move.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:42:28
You are familiar with technical analysis and you dont know the difference between small peak and big peak? Shame...
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:35:39
I am pretty sure... Tonight BTC price will be under 7900. Just watch. No buy orders against a lot of sell orders.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:55:06
9100 -&gt; 8700. DIP is coming soon.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:04:42
Experts: please put your money in bitcoin so we can pull out.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:57:23
I really think this will happen:
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:54:39
I sold before some times, now i have only euro in my wallet. Should i buy at 10500? Bitcoin will reach big sell wall at 11k. Selloff will start, price will scroll down to at least 10500, That will be a temporary dip.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:37:01
I think this is coming soon:
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:30:04
I agree. Just bulltrap.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:13:11
Dont buy right now. Another DIP is coming.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:19:26
I think this is the end of the road for bitcoin. Selloff begins. Before next raise UP, another DIP is coming soon. It still downfall trend:
I believe in bitcon, but i dont want to buy it right now after big pump, cause after big pump - big dump is coming.

Are you retard of what? Its sarcasam.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:36:23
Argumentum ad hominem.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:45:23
Soon it will be under 8000. Bulltrap.
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:56:10
Seems like BTC will reach 8000 before 11000. Selloff begins.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:55:01
May? Hahaha, easy try to push up price.
Bitcoin cant reach 9k...
Trend is still down... Identical to NASDAQ chart.
Without big sell whals from nowhere bitcoin price will be under 7k. Whales just buying time to final crash to 4k.
After that bitcoin will have a chance to recover.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:35:30
Did you learn in school how to calculate %?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:21:57
Bullshit. Price is going to 6000 by the end of the week.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:52:46
Before 2 weeks:
- DIP to 7500
- price between 8000-9000
- after few days price 9500
- next dip to 5900

Thank You! Bitcoin is being pumped heavily right now, big buy walls appeared from nowhere, expect a big dump very soon. I think bitcoin price will drop to 4500, after that bitcoin have a chance to recover. One more DIP is coming soon. I earned some money in the 12.2017., profit didnt make me happy, i believe in bitcoin, its hard now...

Bulltrap.Failure to hit $10,000, followed by a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,851 (Feb. 11 low), would validate the bearish weekly chart and open the doors for a deeper sell-off to as low as $6,000.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:00:15
Dont buy.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:17:52
Redditor for 3 whole days? Muhahaha.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:08:01
Yes i feel it. Big pump from whalse. But, after big pump another big dump is coming.
