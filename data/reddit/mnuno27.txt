My experience  with coin.mx has been excellent. I highly  recommend  them if you want instant BTC!!!  They are a legit!!!! A bit pricey but well worth it 👍

From a person who has accounts on both Coinbase and Circle, I would have to say Circle is the winner!!!!! Here is why:
●With Circle buy and get BTC instantly which means you can make$$$$. Coinbase it takes 4 Days for you to get your BTC. A lot can happen with  BTC as you know...you can lose$$$$.
●Coinbase is making $$$$ in the 4 Days that it takes to get your $$$$.
●Coinbase tends to cancel your BTC order A LOT because of..it is a "High Risk Transaction"

Circle is better in my opinion because of Instant Buy. I hate waiting days for my Bitcoins....plus I miss out on making $$$$ by waiting for my BTC to arrive in my wallet!!!!!
