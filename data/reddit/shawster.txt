This was my thought as well, either some database at coinbase or elsewhere has been breached and leaked. That, or OP is playing it fast and loose with their login info and phone numbers online. 
There are multiple sites that you can sign up for that will alert you when your login info appears in a breach. I use credit karma. They also send me alerts when there are changes to my credit score. This is all for free. It’s a pretty good service.

If you requested a password change, it will often email you with a link to reset the password. The key difference is when you receive an email to reset your password that you didn’t request.

The number may have been a coinbase number, but they were likely spoofing it.
Either that, or that verification code you received was someone trying to break in to your account and coinbase really was calling you to protect you, in which case they would have directed you to go to their site and do it yourself. 
This also raises the important question of how did they get the phone number associated with your coinbase account? It points to a breach of some database somewhere, unless you’ve been playing fast and loose with your phone number and account info online.

Yeah, rolling code authentication is much more secure. Google offers an app.
