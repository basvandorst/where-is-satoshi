I hardly believe you are working for a bank, because such people always double check the terms and conditions.
They always do, as they are aware there might be some tricks and avoid them in advance (like I got the loan with annual interest rate of 8,76% but in fact it was 24%, as there had been additional fees for a loan).

Correct me if I am wrong, but it would be rather impossible for anyone to check the card used for transaction without making transaction with that card in the very first place. 
Anyway, going back to the point - you do not want to comply with explicitly stated requirement which they have on their website. A requirement you have agreed to without bothering to read T&amp;C. 
In your case I strongly discourage you from taking any loans with such approach.

I visited their website and checked their terms and conditions. It directly states that:


So then for me the case is rather clear...

Well, 2014 is over dude. KYC is the norm in the industry (and selfies are actually a norm - ever used binance/blockchain.info/coinbase) - all of the exchanges where you buy cryptos with money require it. 
I would be alarmed if they did not ask for any verification at all. 
Let me guess, you registered, automatically ticked "I agree to the terms and conditions" without even taking a look on it, and you are now surprised that they ask you to follow the rules?
And as far as I know European Union (so far UK is still a part of it) requires companies to keep records of all financial transactions records for some time. So then erasing all your data now could be even...illegal.
Anyway - congratulations, you played yourself well - and good luck in finding a legit exchange without verification procedures which are not scams. If you found one, please let us know.
