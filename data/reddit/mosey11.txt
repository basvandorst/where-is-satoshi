To decrease confirmation times Bitcoin Core developers are currently working on implementing sidechains that process BTC transactions instantly off the main blockchain (dubbed SegWit and Lightning Network). They just released the newest Core 0.13.0 software this past Monday to begin their rollout of such services, which is all well documented and explained on Reddit and other BTC websites.
1. Well, 3-6 is really an arbitrary number. With each passing confirmation, the likelihood of a double spend attack gets exponentially smaller. The first responder to this thread has a very throrough answer.
2. If you decide to use an exchange to get paid for your goods, you should definitely withdraw the funds immediately to an address with private keys under your control to minimize risk exposure to an exchange hacking or theft. The good thing about exchanges is that your buyer won't be able to trace the bitcoins he sent to identify the destination as your private address, because exchanges will credit you with different bitcoins when you withdraw. If you generate your own addresses, you won't expose yourself to exchange hacks but it's very easy to see where all your bitcoins are headed with minimal effort, unless you use a tumbling software that anonymizes your coins. This typically costs a fraction of your BTC, however, and is usually justifiable only if you're dealing with high risk illicit goods, high profile stolen coins, etc.
3. Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, and currently approx. 15.9 million have been mined. It is estimated that all bitcoins will be mined by the year 2160, and from then on miners will collect revenue from transaction fees. Litecoin has been stagnant for quite a while now and is basically on its deathbed. Most of the developers, including the founder, have jumped ship for Bitcoin. Ethereum and Monero have decent outlooks as of right now; personally I think Monero has great potential as it's a completely private and anonymous form of Bitcoin and is worth looking into. Monero's value increased threefold in the past 24 hours as it's been gaining huge momentum lately, and I wouldn't have anything against buying Monero if I wasn't all in on Bitcoin already ��

Bitcoins and altcoins (shitcoins) are two wildly different things. Look up altcoins before coming off as a retard unwilling to do a simple google search

Dump Coinbase and use Circle. I did exactly that last week and I'm still mad at myself for not doing so sooner. Circle charges just 1% in fees for both debit and bank transfers, which is less than half of what Coinbase so boldly charges.

Thanks for the reply. I certainly do hope you're right on the latter. 
For my brain wallet I chose a random string of words, added seeds, then applied a few randomizing algorithms that only I know. I think there's a better chance I'd forget the key words and algorithms than a hacker brute forcing 80+ characters lol

If I were you, I'd scrap the current keys and start all over again.
If you want to be absolutely safe, those private keys should either stay on paper or on a drive that NEVER touches the Internet, and is only accessed through Live USB.
If that wasn't obvious enough already.

Without a doubt, debit card at circle. Hell you can even do this with a PayPal debit card. &lt;1% fees and instant bitcoin purchases

If you're using their app, go to settings&gt;currency&gt;Bitcoin
After you tap Bitcoin, your default currency will be displayed in BTC.
On the buy page, click on the green BTC or USD marker to switch between currencies. 
On their website, go to your name tag on the top right. Click settings&gt;currency&gt;Bitcoin

1. Yes, all the sender would need is your btc address. It's not done quite instantly; the unconfirmed transaction will show up immediately, much like a credit card transaction. However, a Bitcoin transaction must generally be confirmed at least 3-6 times on the network to be rendered permanent, and that takes 30min to 1hr as each confirmation takes approx. 10 minutes. (a credit card trans takes 3-5 days to fully process)
2. Yes, absolutely. That's why you should create multiple addresses for payment (you can generate as many as you want) or accept payments through an exchange, then transfer to your private wallet. As blockchain is completely transparent, generating your own addresses will allow the sender to monitor where the bitcoins are headed. If you want a bit of privacy, use the exchange option (you don't withdraw the same btc you are paid, much like how a bank won't give you the same notes you deposited)
3. Definitely accept Bitcoin from all who offer to pay with it. Just make sure you get 3-6 confirmations on each transaction if you're dealing with irreversible services, anonymous buyers, etc.

Definitely Circle, if you're in the US (which I'm assuming). It's no comparison. Circle facilitates instant purchases using a debit card, in which you are charged a total of approx. 1% in fees. Bitcoins are then credited right away. They have an app on the App Store for ease of use as well.
Coinbase just raised their fees in a way that they are (underhandedly) priced into the buy values, so you end up paying that spread plus their declared fees. If you pay via debit, they'll charge you exorbitant amounts near 5% of the total. Pay via bank transfer and they'll make you wait a week to receive your bitcoins. 
I've never used Gemini, however I doubt they can come close to Circle's offer. Definitely check them out though when it comes to amounts over $3000 (as Circle's weekly maximum for all accounts is $3000).
Buy now and HODL! ���� happy bitcoining

Definitely Circle

Sorry, that reminds me. I signed up last week and my initial limit was $300 or .5 BTC just like yours.
I uploaded a pic of my ID via their website and immediately received a $3000 limit without a waiting period or review, on day 1. This process is used at most other exchanges that accept reversible fiat payment forms for bitcoins (debit/credit card transactions), in order to protect the exchange from fraud and chargebacks.
