Yeah it could go a long way in ruining bitcoin. To allow 3rd party entities to dictate which coins are okay to use is a serious break from everything bitcoin was built for.
The correct way of handling theft is not to change how money works but to track the thieves down and prosecute them.
Every way that you can change the bitcoin network/blockchain I'm order to "revert" this will cause massive damage to bitcoin itself. It's kinda the way it's built.

Complex things can be simplified for actual use. Just look at your phone. It's a really really complicated device that 50 years ago would have taken up a room and required several highly trained technicians to operate.
Complexity is not a barrier to entry. Ease of use is. It's very possible to make the LN more or less transparent to an end user. A little icon in the gui that goes from a chain to a lightning symbol and you're done.

Right, so just because a proposed solution isn't the end-all be-all perfect solution it's not going to work?
It's funny that one of the complaints in the article is about paydays and people funding their channels at the same time. As if paydays are some kind of universal constraint and not a direct effect of the current banking system.
In a lightning/bitcoin based world you would likely get your paycheck streamed to your channels over time. Because why should your company get to keep the fruits of your labor for a month?
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:44:19
No. Since the hw wallet has to sign each transaction it's trivial to ensure that channel balance doesn't fall under a preset value. The hw wallet is aware of all its channels and can easily require that all transactions are balanced before signing anything.

Exploded computer, hardware wallet and or backup will always be a problem with bitcoin. There's never any central authority that can help you. Sensible users will have backups. Sensible wallets will encrypt backups with your seed.
You can absolutely safely back up your LN channels to the cloud as long as they are encrypted. You can have your punishment keys on online services without losing security.
There are many things left to work out regarding safe LN usage but most of it can be secured using the same mechanisms that we use to secure our bitcoin today.
LN will require a more active monitoring of the blockchain. LNs need both parties in a transaction to be online.
I personally believe most LN end users will use cloud services but it is of course possible to build these services so that you still have your keys.
As long as you CAN run LNs yourself, as long as you CAN punish bad actors yourself, the system will work.

Sure and once the rebalancing funds are out the node will stop. Which is a good thing if it's compromised.  Lightning fees are supposed to be very very low so this fund would probably run out after a few dollars worth making this kind of attack very low reward. A node should be able to rebalance by just adjusting its own fee structure most of the time.

No miner is going to throw away that many blocks just to fraud a house transaction. Especially as you can't just buy a house anonymously.
At say 100s of millions transactions you should be a bit weary but this type of thing realistically affects no one.
If a miner tries to invalidate a transaction it has to waste a lot of mining energy to do so. Most (all?) pools are comprised of many entities that would leave quite quick if profits starts dropping.
Centralized mining is bad for sure but your example is also bad. No one is going to start a massive defraud like this unless they have a ridiculously lot to win. And the pools just don't have that incentive.

Hard to say really. If most exchanges and places where people use coins where to connect tomorrow it would be enough for most users. But running your own personal lightning hub might not be for everyone. 
I'm just hoping that the mere possibility of average Joe being able torun a node is enough to keep the main players on their toes. Most people don't hold their coins but the ability to do so means that those that provide web wallets have to provide superior service or they will go under.
Hardware wallets are a check for web wallets. Home lightning clients will be a check for Webb lightning providers. Bitcoin is a check for the regular banking system.
As long as it's feasible to run your own system the big boys have to watch their steps.

@_date: 2018-01-03 20:14:16
This is probably too much for the current simple wallets like ledger nano and trezor yes. But there are several other more advanced wallets thats could likely handle it. I believe that a hardware lightning node dongle will be a cost effective way of running a node securely over time. 
Since the wallet needs to see the blockchain in any case limiting fees over time is trivial. The blockchain ledger is a timekeeping system as well.

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:15:18
As far as I know you can't really lock funds infinitely. There has to be a time even if it's very very long. 
Both parties do have an exit transaction each and if both parties use them then the channel closure is instant (pending confirmation on-chain). If one party is unresponsive or uncooperative then the other party can close the channel but will have to wait a few days or possibly weeks to get their funds out. This window is designed to let a wronged party take his revenge if an old transaction is posted.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:11:12
Fees are proposed to be a fraction of the transaction and not a per byte cost as on-chain. Fees will be measured in millisatoshis.
There will be some fees to inhibit spam but since the cost of entry and operations of a LN node is low it will, like OP states, be a race to the bottom. Nodes publish their fee requirements and will likely balance these up and down depending on its channel balances and amount of active channels open.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:34:09
"Safe spaces" are a fucking cancer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:22:04
I haven't seen any actual work on this but in theory one of the more capable hardware wallets should be able to handle this. Keep a hw wallet/node dongle connected to your node at all times. Make it aware of the amounts going in and out and set some logic to only sign transactions that equal out. That way your node can handle transactions and channel balancing and it can't be emptied if the node is compromised.
If you want to use your node to pay you need to input a code into the device and so on. If the hardware lacks storage it can use the host to store encrypted data or even use the cloud.
Some issues I can forsee is if an attacker can force a compromised node to publish an old channel state or similar so it needs to handle most such things in an encrypted fashion. But layering encryption like that shouldn't be a problem.

Many early socialist philosophes saw the economic system as a zero sum game. But to me that seems kind of fals. "Value" can be created and destroyed in a sense. X amount of labor doesn't always create Y amount of value. It's to simplistic.

In a more perfect world a cryptocurrency could easily be created that distributes all wealth equally among all citizens. Cryptocurrency isn't inherently capitalistic nor socialist, it's simply a way to trace value that can't be subverted.
A perfectly ethical communism would embrace the way that a cryptocurrency can make every transaction open to scrutiny by the people. If all government spending was on a public chain corruption would become a lot harder and as history has proved centralized power cabals have formed almost immediately in every communistic experiment.
But alas late stage doesn't have any solutions they just whine about what we have. They frequently have very good examples about how really fucked many parts of our economical system really is but the "Safe zone" bullshit is just pure thought crime mentality.

If a channel becomes close to tapped out in one direction the risk slightly increase for one party so they may decide to close. Otherwise I don't really know. Early LN specs called for shorter lived channels but I think modern LN could be set with very high locktimes. A channel always have a close time upon creation but this could conceivably be set hundreds of years in the future since both parties have a "closeout transaction" on hand at all times.
I suspect channels will eventually be set for a year or so so even if you lose your channel keys the transaction will return to you eventually.
But I haven't seen any hard suggestions for actual real life times.

Signed but not signed into a block.
LN is regular bitcoin. So any extra complexity that LN has will always be added to the complexity that Bitcoin already has. So in no possible reality is LN as complex or less complex than bitcoin.
The complexity, like the bitcoin complexity, can be hidden from the user with clever software. But as of yet it isn't and there are so much left to do that it sometimes seems futile.
LN is very clever but in many ways it's also limited. Setting up channels and getting liquidity are not simple problems. Scaling up to millions of users is not a simple problem.
LN is very good as a micro transaction protocol but it isn't a scaling solution for bitcoin.
I also hope for some kind of LN hardware wallet because keeping keys online feels iffy.
LN is not a silver bullet that will save bitcoin nor is it a massive failure that will never work. But to me it's very clear that we need a lot of work on layer one (the blockchain) as well in order for bitcoin to survive. I sincerely hope that the LN complexity can be managed but from my testing there's still a long way to go.

Not impossible. There are some physical aspects of being at different places that can't be fudged. Mainly travel time for signals.
It might be possible to create a system where nodes ping other nodes with signed messages and some of the mining is combining different messages when you get them. So a node that can sign messages from other nodes at specific times can be premiered in some ways. But the network would have to work on some kind of microsecond block scale so I'm not sure it would work in practice. Also things like slow routing would ruin your node's score.
So not impossible, but likely not practical.
Other possibilities are satellites or weird stuff like bouncing lasers off the moon. Hard to decentralize.

Nodes makes note of when they see a transaction, old transactions are thrown out. Most wallet software has a limit where they stop marking funds as spent if the transaction hasn't gone through. 
While you of course CAN run an old transaction and it would be possible to mess with people by repeating old transaction after the standard timeout there still is such a thing as too old transactions in practice.

Setting the perfect fee is impossible. There is no algorithm that can find a perfect fee when competing with other algorithms for finite capacity. 
You see a perfect fee would always get you included in the next block but if there are more transactions than blockspace it's impossible to fit everyone. Algorithms try to look at past fees and current mempool and so on but they can't, yet, get anywhere close to what a person can.
When blocks are full you are the best fee estimator, not your wallet.

Yes, since transactions on the LN are cheap I suppose channels will be rebalanced quite frequently. And of course the fees will constantly reflect the way the node wants the transactions to flow.

No, not unless you haven't yet upgraded to segwit. 
But VerCash doesn't do anything better than the other altcoins. And as I said before. If VerCAsh becomes popular the fees will be the same. Once blocks are full the fees rocket. If you keep increasing block size you will either hit lightspeed/storage speed limits or you will centralize the fuck out of your currency.
The only solutions are layer 2 networks, sharding or some kind of mesh thingy like iota and friends. Verycoin isn't pushing either of these techs forward, bitcoin is.

Fees have nothing to do with amount sent and everything to do with size of transaction in bits. A transaction from multiple accounts is more expensive than a transaction from one account.
The problem is that if you set too low of a fee most nodes won't transmit it and most miners will never include it. It will be as if it never happened. But most software treats a transmitted transaction as a done deal and won't let you transact the same coins again. 
More advanced wallet will let you replace by fee where you do the same transaction again with higher fees. There are also accelerator services that chain onto a low fee transaction with a high fee one causing the transaction chain to be more likely to be mined.
There are many ways to technically handle times of congestion sadly it's hard to code something that always choose the best path. Picking the perfect fee is technically impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:28:01
There are of course several way of reducing the amount of power actually generated. In hydroplants you close the hatches or let more water pass by without going through the turbines if the magazines are full, in nuclear plants you can modulate the reaction (even if this is slow and inefficient), on wind turbines you can change the angle of the blades, in fossil plants you just limit the amount of fuel going in.
But the argument I'm responding to here is that china is producing more energy than it's consuming leading to an actual "surplus" of electricity, which just isn't true because it isn't possible.
Also there are few actual turbines that have variable blades as far as I know since most turbines have a **lot** of really small blades. At least those driven by steam.
But limiting the power input from the turbine doesn't make the excess electricity go somewhere it just lowers the amount of electricity produced.

I haven't been in this situation so take this as more of pointers than actual advice. 
If you can get your seed or private key out of your current wallet you can do a fresh reset of mycelium or any other serious wallet software. If that wallet hasn't ever seen the spending transaction and it never hit the blockchain you should have your money to be spent upon reset.
Otherwise there is this  that you can do in electrum.

It all depends upon which wallet you used to send the transaction.

That way the attacker might gain access to some channels but never the actual keys nor the punishment transaction secrets (I guess those would have to be manually approved since they're supposed to be really rare). If your ledger app require that you balance all in and out before signing it shouldn't be possible to steal funds either unless you get physical access.

Setting up a channel is a maintenance thing. Your client will do it when fees are low. It stands to reason that if you move transactions off chain then there will be less congestion and lower fees.
LNs will also speed up segwit adoption which will also lower fees.
And lastly it's imho rather likely that we will get larger block within a few years. It's just more important to get layer 2 and segwit working than it is to raise the blocksize right now.

Of course LN is a different group. I haven't claimed anything else. Core are the main group responsible for the basic protocol of bitcoin. And currently the basic protocol doesn't work very well.
No one is asking them to implement a solution or fix tomorrow. I'm fully aware that responsible cryptocurrency coding takes a great deal of time. But that's the main issue. If they aren't talking now then there can't be any kind of fix on its way in any kind of near term.
The argument that I have to be better at something in order to discuss or complain is so deeply flawed that I'm not going to touch it any further. Attacking me as a person instead of my opinion is weak.

Addresses generated by services like coinbase might "expire" if their system forgets them or something.
Addresses created by your hardware wallet are all generated by your wallet seed. Simplified you take function(seed, n) and you get an adress.  Where n is a number that probably starts with 1. Since its slightly more insecure to reuse an address your wallet will increase n by 1 every time you need an address. It's trivial for the wallet to check through millions of different n:s so your wallet will always be able to see all addresses generated from its seed. So if a hardware wallet has generated an address it can always generate the key again if needed. As long as you have the seed that generated an adress you won't lose funds due to lost addresses.
I suspect it's slightly more advanced in practice but the principle is the same. You can receive and send from the same address multiple times if you really want to.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:32:28
Yes. Any cross chain swap or LN will be more or less anonymizing.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:46:05
I understand LN. It's still complicated.
It isn't impossible to hide this complexity from the user but it's still there. A LN transaction is vastly diffrent from a regular bitcoin transaction. Sure at the basic level you just have a bunch of valid but unsigned transactions but it's the rest that is complex. 
Setting up channels, getting liquidity to send and receive, routing, watch towers, channel backup, channel balancing, channel closings, keeping keys on online computers and so on. 
LN opens up for the possibility to actually stream money securely in real time. This is extremely cool. But even someone that's enthusiastic about LN, like me, can still see that there are many areas where LN is overly complex and clunky.
Ask yourself: How much data does a watchtower need per user and how often does it need to be updated? How do you know that your node that just rebooted from a random crash still have the latest transactions? Because if it sends an old state it will lose the entire channel. Finding a path through the network isn't an easy problem. As the network grows this gets more complicated, not less.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:29:40
Open markets and competing business models are not an excuse to be an absolute dick. This isn't about right or wrong it's about being an honorable person and not a moneygrabbing shitshow.
It's completely possible to create a bitcoin fork without using confusing names and tricking newbies. It's completely possible to grow large on your own merits like ethereum without using coordinated media tactics and high level shilling and spamming.
Consider this, if bcash proponents have to drag themselves through this much mud just to get a place at the table then what good is it?

You don't actually use the entire capacity of all your channels at one time. If you do that you are stupid since a regular transaction is more appropriate. Every lightning transaction can always fall-back to on-chain and on-chain will get cheaper once the congestion lessens due to LNs and segwit.
Maxing your credit card or checking account isn't a regular occurrence and isn't a problem for the network to fix. LNs are for streaming small amount of money. It's a micropayment system.
If you have 3 channels and your usage has made them unbalanced your software will lower it's fees for facilitating transfers through your channels until they are balanced again. The system is self balancing. 
There's nothing stopping anyone from making a completely trustless system where you can fund and withdraw from channels by paying or receiving a regular transaction from another LN node. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:03:23
Yes it is. The entire system of public private key cryptography is close to magic to me. And then adding things like Merkel trees and everything is beyond insane.

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:28
You are correct but in practice there is such a thing as a too old or a too low fee transaction even if it shouldn't be that way according to the protocol specs. Especially now days when the pool never ever really empties.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:14:59
This is complete FUD. Setting up channels will be based on published fee structure. Nodes that try to raise fees will not get new channels and will have their existing channels closed. The incentive is to be competitive fee wise.
A node **can** have high fees just as miners **can** mine empty blocks but the system is set up so that those actions hurt the one doing them more.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:25
What do you know of the costs? This isn't just changing a number in a config file, it's the simultaneous upgrade of a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. In what possible world is that something you do for a temporary fix? The last upgrade wasn't even a hard fork and it still took a year to get the network to even begin switching. Bitcoin is designed to be incredibly resistant to change.
What research do you have that upping the blocksize would fix the issue even temporarily?  Because as far as I can see if X people are willing to pay the current fees why wouldn't 2X or 4X people be willing to pay slightly lower fees? The upper bound of possible amounts of transactions is several orders of magnitude larger than the current capacity. Incresing block size will kill nodes, not today but absolutely over time. And what will we win? A month? Three months?
Do we need a blocksize increase at some point? Absolutely. But right now we need services to upgrade to segwit more. We need layer 2 solutions more. We need to optimize block usage before we increase block capacity.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:38:55
I will never ever call any denomination of bitcoin bits. It's just the most stupid unit to use.

Consensus is the mechanism by which the bitcoin network decides what state the database/blockchain is and what rules that govern it. It's a type of mathematically based majority where the basic guidelines are set so that selfish acts are useful for the system (mining and so on).
Breaking consensus means to actively stop listening to the majority to break away parts of the network. This is what bcash did. At some specific point they created a block that the consensus discarded as invalid but they kept building on. This is a clear violation of the white paper and the Nakamoto Consensus and therefore bcash is no longer bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:48:32
A transaction on LN is close to instant. All that is needed is that your peers stay up during the probably microseconds it will take to setup the transaction chain and transfer the tokens. If a peer happen to go offline during that exact time it will cause timeouts but since you will always have multiple routes to the receiver the system will just use them instead.
Worst case if a peer never comes up again is that you have to wait a week or so for just that channel to revert to your wallet. But this will be rather rare.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:27:29
Which is kinda pointless because no miner will mine extremely old or extremely low fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:48:18
I respond that the current popularity of bitcoin is severely taxing the network and the large operators failure to upgrade their infrastructure is hurting this further. There are many small optimizations in the works but to hurry a deployment on a multi billion dollar system without enough testing and research is a recipe for disaster, just look at the s2x fuckery that would have stalled the entire network on day one if implemented large scale.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:23:33
Trezor and ledger
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:32:55
Not quite.
Every bitcoin address is comprised of two parts, the public address and a private key. The public address is the thing people send coin to and the private key is what you need to spend the money.
A wallet is a collection of addresses. Modern wallets are called deterministic  wallets. The wallet itself has a master private key that it uses to generate all the addresses. The wallet master key is a long string of bits so in order to make it easier for humans we often represent this as 24 words. This is called a seed because you use it to generate addresses.
If you have your money on an exchange you don't have your seed and you don't have your keys. In a very real sense you don't actually have any bitcoin.
Every serious modern wallet will use the seed system and they will have you write down your seed on a piece of paper when you initialize the wallet. With this piece of paper you can then access your wallet from any good wallet software by just using the restore from backup option. 
The seed IS you bitcoin. If someone has the seed they have the coins. If you don't have your seed you don't have your coins and if you don't have your coins you can't guarantee that you will get anything in a split.
In short, get a good wallet. Either a hardware one like trezor or ledger or a good app version like mycelium or bread. Transfer most of your coin to this wallet and be extremely careful with how you store your backup and other codes. Do not keep a lot of coins on exchanges or non-seed online wallets, it isn't your money.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:50:38
You are missing the use case.
If you want to send me money you would just send a regular transaction. If we both had some LN channels already we could use them. No one opens a channel to another person just to transact back and forth because that doesn't make any sense.
You never "park" you coin anywhere. You move them to layer 2 channels that you have with multiple hubs. You don't have to move money out of the channels because you can use them better when they are in the channels. The channels are your checking or salary account. The regular bitcoin wallet will be your savings account. You will both get and send money over lightning and your system will balance your channels both on and off chain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:25:30
You really don't understand the concept of decentralized do you?
Bitcoin is an open source project that has created a decentralized network. Decentralization is a defense mechanism for the network. It has nothing to do with the software. The software is hosted on a centralized repo and is maintained by more or less one person with the help of a few key devs and around a hundred volunteers.
Bitcoin is a standard open source project.
The bitcoin network is decentralized because it's the best way to defend against attacks.
Nothing you say makes sense.

Yeah the blocksize will have to be increased at some point. The argument of us small blockers is that a blocksize increase isn't an answer to scaling. It's better to push through the layer 2 solutions now and increase blocksize later. LN + Segwit can't yet be a global economy but pure blocksize increase can never be a global economy.

No, no one can, because it's technically impossible.
You have an unknown amount of players, some you can see others you can't, each of you is staking an amount and only the ones that are in the top will get added to a block. For every possible bet you make there is a chance that enough others will bet over you that you will not win.
A human can use soft data, pattern recognition and out of the box thinking to get a transaction through. An algorithm is limited.
It is impossible to know the optimal fee until after the block is published. 
Many wallets overpay as a strategy and that isn't working very well. If one 60 sat/b went through then technically every other transaction that went through could have been 61 sat instead of the hundreds that the max one probably was.
Fee competition is an extremely hard problem.

Eth currently is a ticking bomb that the devs have a pretty good idea about how to defuse. Eth will need some serious rework to survive since the blockchain is growing rapidly and the difficulty is designed to be close to impossible to mine in the long run. The plan is to hard fork into a sharding system with proof of stake instead of mining. It's not impossible but it requires a fair bit of central control in the short term.
Eth is not designed to be a currency. It's designed to be a smart contract platform. You can absolutely make currencies on eth (see ICO and such) but the main eth chain isn't designed with the same philosophy as bitcoin.
Ethereum is a fantastic thing that might go on to be a massive world player. But it actually isn't directly competing with bitcoin.

Because trying to keep up with demand on a blockchain is pointless. You're just pushing the problems into the future and next time it will be worse. When fees go up today it hurts early adopters slightly. If fees skyrocket in a few years you suddenly can't access your paycheck. Now is not the time to use the easy quick fixes, now is the time to design a system that can handle the future.
Most other cryptos would creak under the current load that bitcoin has as well. Every blockchain has the same basic problem. Before we start scaling we need to have a method that is theoretically able to actually handle the scaling issue.
We need Lightning, sidechains and all the other systems now, before people are actually living off bitcoin.
If the bitcoin system is filled with millionaires the merchants will follow. As soon as some fixes start appearing we will possibly have an explosion of "lightning accepted here" commerce.

Then you are drawing the power. Running pumps uses energy. You are talking about producing more power than is being used which would lead to voltage spiking and the entire system burning up.
The elctrical grid while in constant flux is a zero sum game. You put in X and you use X. At some point you might use X+Y but the system has inductive properties that lets you do this for a short while until the production can catch up and produce X+Y, but over time it equals out. 
If you overproduce energy you get failure states where you need to isolate and short parts of the grid to ground which is bad. If you underproduce energy you get brownouts or blackouts.
The grid must constantly balance power generation to match power consumption. If you turn on your microwave it can be more or less exactly traced back to a minute increase in the resistance of the generator turbine spinning at your power plant.
Conservation of energy is a basic law after all.

They are very complex but still very easy to use. Even the super cheap ones are extremely complex.
I'm quite convinced that many of the more advanced hardware wallets could do LN node handling with just some firmware development.
The secure area on even older iPhones is still completely unbroken from a security standpoint. Not even the feds are getting in when they actually have the phone in their hands.
LN nodes will probably be hardware secured eventually. It won't be too expensive and it won't be too complex.

I was an active bitcoiner long before I was on reddit. I kept up with news about bitcoin via RSS feeds and the like. 
Like many others I had almost all of my funds on gox, I mean the price was just so so high. I could buy real things with real money if I could just get it out to my bank account.
So I was trading some, being stupid, playing some satoshi dice and so on. I wanted to withdraw some money to fiat so I started the process of withdrawing money form mt.gox. As I recall I's actually had managed to pull money out before but suddenly the transactions were stuck, nothing came out.
I began researching a bit and there were rumors that the frequent crashes and "bank troubles" that Gox had perhaps weren't accidents. I also heard that the Japanese were getting money out of Gox. The transfer pending thing just didn't ring true with me and at the same time the price kept moving like crazy.
So I figured "to hell with this" and transferred my coins out to my wallet (a web wallet because I wasn't very smart about my coins at the time). Shortly after Gox went down completely. Had some friends that had bought some coins from me that lost everything.
We here on this sub tend to think of ourselves as the bitcoin community but in reality we aren't. I was an active bitcoiner long before I knew this place even existed. I wasn't even aware about the "big names" in bitcoin until just a few years ago. I'd read about Satoshi but the rest of them? Had no idea.
Never be fooled that the things you read or the opinions you have are universal. There are thousands perhaps millions of people trading bitcoin without any connection with your reality.

It isn't a vulnerability if the incentives are stacked against it happening. It's an
edge case.
A node can try to keep your channel hostage, but it likely won't since that will cost it money.
A node can try to publish an earlier channel state, but it likely won't since it will lose money.
A node can go unresponsive to delay a transaction chain, but it likely won't since it will lose money.

You pay transaction fees for every transaction on the LN but they will be very very low. Microsatoshis is used internally. Your only regular bitcoin fees will be when setting up and closing a channel but a channel can live for a very long time.
Your software will keep a set of channels open and will balance them according to efficiency and reach.

Because it's actually even more effective to go cross chain via lightning. You can do cross chain atomic swaps on the lightning network.

Layer 1 fees. There is no layer 0 here. The timeout issue is going to be exceedingly rare.
And firstly fees aren't 15 dollars just because some people pay 15 dollars. I can overpay how much I want. 
And lastly, the entire point of LNs is to lower the amount of on chain transactions which will mean that fees will lower not raise.

If just more than 12% of the network moved over to segwit we would have some breathing room at least.

Mining isn't a runaway cost. It has a hard limit. No one mines for free, if mining costs more than you make you will stop mining. As long as bitcoin rises in value there's room for more mining. But as rewards lower and bitcoin price levels out so will mining environmental impact slow down.
Mining is actually useful for areas that are trying to build power capacity without having enough consumers. In a global view mining will flow to areas with cheap electricity. This movement could actually be seen as helping humanity's electric production to equalize.
It isn't a too far fetched idea to say build a large hydro-plant in a rural non-developed are and finance that by placing containers filled with mining hardware close to the plant until the areas industrial and residential capacity usage increases enough to saturate the plant causing the containers to be moved elsewhere. A large power plant needs to produce a certain amount of kWH just to be profitable.

This is done completely trustless. It's a cross chain atomic swap done via lightning. It's completely secure and instant.
regular cross chain atomic swaps are blockchain transactions on two separate chains that only work as an atomic transaction. Either both go trough or none goes through. This is accomplished by some crypto magic where both transactions have multiple scripts that use each others secrets to work. Ergo the transaction on Bitcoin has a payout that's only possible if you have the data from the Litecoin transaction and vice versa. If a transaction on either chain fails the funds return to the transacting parties.
A ligthning based cross chain atomic swap is the same thing but instead of two on-chain transactions the transactions are lightning transactions off-chain. These are instant but just as secure. If the other party tries to rip you off you can always just publish the transactions to the blockchains and they will be on-chain instead just like regular LN transactions.
Coins in a LN are still yours, you can use the LN to spend them. If you want them on chain you just fill up one of your LN channels and cash it out and the money will be in your regular wallet.

There needs to be a punishment for actors publishing old channel states otherwise the system wouldn't work.
The scheme is something like this.
Channel state A: Y:10 (you) C:10 (counterparty)
1. you send 5 units over the channel (Transaction 1) - (State B) Y:5 C:15
2. you recieve 10 units (Transaction 2) - (State C) Y:15 C:5
Now if the counterparty could publish the old state (B) he could steal 10 units from you. So in actuality a transaction looks like this
Transaction 1
     
* Your part: Send 15 to C instantly, send 5 to Y with a timelock of 10 days.     
* Counterpartys part: Send 5 to Y instantly, send 15 to C with a timelock of 10 days.
But there is also a punishment transaction.
Transaction 1
* Your part: Send 15 to C instantly, send 5 to me with a timelock of 10 days. If **secret** is known send remaining 5 to C instantly    
* Counterpartys part: Send 5 to Y instantly, send 15 to me with a timelock of 10 days. If **secret** is known send remaining 15 to Y instantly  
When creating transaction 2 you both also get each others **secrets**.
In short, for every new channel state you also get the secret needed to take the entire channel if the other party publishes an old state. The main security issue here is that you only have the locktime to do it. So if the locktime is 10 days you need to publish your secret in 10 days to get the entire channel. So you either need to periodically go online or you need some kind of watch service that keeps tabs for you. In practice the mere existence of the punishment will deter people from trying. The system is meant as a microtransaction system primarily so a single channel shouldn't ever be worth ruining your reputation over.

Native segwit and bech32 addresses aren't the same thing. Ledger is fully segwit but it doesn't yet support the bech32 address system which to be honest no one else really does either. No merchants, no exchanges and no block explorers.
Also as far as I can read the space savings are more in the 10% range.
Of course everyone should endeavor to support bech32 but it's wrong to claim implementations that doesn't aren't "native".
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:15:54
It's possible that adoption of segwit and one to many transactions by the large actors like coinbase as well as the bech32 adress system could lower the actual block usage per transaction to a level that is a net minus over time.
Sadly that interest seems to be lacking among the big players. Our best option is to stop using services that fill up our blockchain with bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:37:28
As far as I understand bech32 gives a 10% advantage and it isn't really supported anywhere. Segwit itself is supported in most services and systems so that should be the important change. Once we have all wallets segwit aware it shouldn't be that difficult to add bech32.

Just like your cellphone is too complex, no one will ever be able to use an advanced computer in their pocket... Or? I mean the linux kernel is what thousands or millions of LoCs? No one could use that.
The whole point of electronics is to hide complexity behind easy interfaces.
In computer science layer 0 is often the physical layer. Bitcoin hasn't got a physical layer so a more apt description would be that the internet is bitcoins layer 0.
No end-user would open dozens of channels a day. Why would they?
So you are stupid enough to pay $100 in fees and it's bitcoins fault? Go FUD somewhere else.

A hw wallet isn't that expensive. Since facilitating transactions requires the input and output to balance out perfectly with cryptographic security it's no problem having the hw wallet be aware of this before it signs anything. Thus no one can empty a node since asymetrical spending has to be physically cleared by inputting a pin or similar.
A compromised node can be forced to balance channels in weird directions but no funds will be lost.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:51
I don't think it's that difficult to make a hw wallet understand balancing of channels and receive only. It should be able to cryptographically check channel states and only sign states that results in a net plus or perhaps a slight minus for periodic rebalancing. I'd not be surprised if some of the more intelligent hw wallets could be made to do this already. 
If the wallet also tries to store all states and secrets encrypted on say dropbox or similar even physical theft would be protected against.
I personally think that secure lightning node dongels will be standard for basic home nodes in just a few years.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:53:40
Bitstamp is one of the largest exchanges, it uses segwit. Trezor and ledger are the most popular hw wallets, they speak segwit.

Yes, but that is use of electricity. It's converting electricity to heat. It's also something that is actively avoided. If the grid notices that the voltage is going up it's going to lower production.
Broadly speaking electricity is always produced at the same rate as it's consumed since storage is still unfeasible. 
The imbalances in the network is usually soaked with [inertial response]( and that's why modern grids needs a few large masses of rotating copper even if we have a lot of solar and wind. Somewhere there need to be a large rotating mass that can be tapped to keep the system in balance.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:27:41
As far as I understand this is a separate network that is pegged to the regular blockchain. In order to move funds to it you currently need to give them to a trusted party that will give you corresponding rootstock tokens in return. It seems that they want to move to a trustless peg which will probably be like the lightning system that will require periodical monitoring of the blockchain to protect clients from fraud.
I'm not really clear about how it will be mined/secured, they talk about merge mining which is a concept I'm going to look up now. I suspect it might be possible for a miner to also sign rootstock transactions in a separate data structure once it has created a bitcoin block or something.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:25:25
The amount of possible transactions per time unit is fixed. It doesn't matter how many miners there are.
The system balances itself to get 6 blocks per hour. One block is limited to 1mb of transactions.
Gathering dust like OP has is best done when the transaction pool is close to empty. Those moments are getting scarce though.

The smallest part of a lightning network is a bidirectional channel. 
The channel consists of two transactions, one from you for X btc to the receiver and one from the receiver to you for the same amount. This creates a channel for 2X btc between you. Every change in the channel state say if you want to pay Y to the other party is represented by two signed but unpublished transactions changing the channel state so that we have: 
you: X-Y and receiver X+Y
If at any point the channels is getting close to Y:0 &amp; R:2X the channel is tapped out and needs to be rebalanced or closed.
The "state" is stored on your client and at the receiver's end as regular transactions. Both transactions would if published send the channel state to your respective wallets but they aren't the same. Your transaction would give the receiver his funds instantly but your part would be timelocked for a set period and vice versa.
The key part of this scheme is that every new channel state also has the keys to a punishment transaction in the previous state. So if your counter party tries to publish an old state you could use your current state to take the entire channel during the timelock period.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:45
There's no real barrier to building hardware wallets that can handle node traffic. Just make the wallet aware that for every output there has to be an input and it's impossible to steal funds. Have all actual own usage be signed with an on-device password and periodically back up transaction secrets and states encrypted with a standard seed key.
The same thing can be done on a phone with secure storage as well

@_date: 2017-12-15 07:58:51
There's an important distinction. 
There are native and and non-native segwit **addresses**. But the entire segwit understanding system is another matter entirely.
A wallet that can see segwit but can't speak it properly isn't native, like the core wallets inability to do change addresses and such. But Trezor and Ledger speak segwit just fine they just don't have the rather newly fangled fancy addresses implemented.

Edit: Great getting downvoted for pointing out actual physics facts. This sub is weird. 
To iterate: No powerplant in the world is outputting significantly more than is consumed, it's impossible. Every watt of electricity produced has to go somewhere. China's hydro dams have a lot more capacity than is actually needed and that drives down prices, just like the OP video states, but that doesn't mean in any real way that they are actually producing excess electricity that just fizzles out in the ether or some shit.

Two major ways:
1. Fee economy 
2. Need for the system
In the fee economy scenario miners recoup and earn by getting fees, this might lead to ridiculously high fees unless many optimizations and layers are implemented.
In the need scenario the service providers using the system would run the mining at a loss since they are dependant on it in order to make money. So exchanges, payment processors, large economic actors would run miners despite losing money since they need bitcoin working in order to exist.

Decentralization is a property of the network. It has absolutely zero to do with the development strategy. Bitcoin didn't appear, it was made.

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:12:07
Yes but early adopters will know that. Bitcoin on LN is more liquid than bitcoin on chain. You can spend and move it instantly. Once you have some channels you can buy bitcoin on coinbase and send to your LN wallet, you can get paid to your LN wallet and you can pay from your LN. There will likely be services that let you spend LN to blockchain as well if you need to. A service can make money from collecting many transactions and bundling them on the blockchain.
Funds on LNs are not locked, they are more free.

Every "hub" will take a minuscule fee per transaction. We're talking microsatoshis here. Anyone with some coin can run a hub and anyone can connect to any hub as long as that hub has coins left to open a channel. It's likely that your software will just use a kind of "autopilot" to create the amount of channels to some amount of well connected peers/hubs to keep your payment capacity in check. If a channel gets close to empty or full it might get cashed out but your software will likely try to use all your channels to balance each other. 
There will be fees. Fees will be payed per hop per transaction. They will be really really low. A person/hub/peer who is well connected and always online will get more fees. A person who isn't online all the time will pay fees. 
Setting up channels will be done on the blockchain proper so miners won't lose out at all really.

You are incorrect in your assumptions.


It won't cost $20 dollars to set up a channel because:
1. LNs will decrease the mempool which will lower fees
2. Your LN wallet will wait for cheap intervals to set up channels
3. Future layers might mean that you can fund a channel without using the blockchain directly


Channels can technically live for years


You are not thinking multichannel systems. You do not open a channel to a merchant, you open multiple channels to the network. You don't "lock-up" funds in a channel, you move money into a high speed transaction network where they are more free than before. If a channel is empty you can just fund it again. Tell your exchange to pay out via LN, tell your boss to pay you via LN. Channels are multidirectional. Your client will endeavor to balance your channels to maximize spending ability. If you need to cash out your fill one of your channels up and then close it. 


No, just no. Is your checking account one way? Or do you perhaps get paid once in a while? If you don't have a use case for bidirectionality you just won't use LN. As an added bonus the ones that do use LN will still assure that your on-chain fees are lowered.
The absolute key points about LNs are these:
1. LNs will lower fees, both for people on the LN and for people who don't
2. Channels are not customer&lt;-&gt;merchant. Channels are customer&lt;-&gt;LN&lt;-&gt;service. The LN is (or at least will be) a vast network of clients, services, hubs and exchanges.
Think of it like the internet. Remote computing used to be point to point. You called another computer with your modem and then you talked. This is inefficient and expensive. Then someone figured out that if you connect a lot of computers together you don't have to call the one you want to talk to you just need to call one node that's close to you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:34:20
No there was a majority of nodes, miners, services and users that implemented the segwit activation. Majority is consensus. Bitcoin has systems in place to upgrade itself within consensus.
I use bitcoin quite often. I'm not happy with the current mempool and lack of optimization from major companies using the mempool. That doesn't mean that I feel the need to burn everything down and start over. Splitting and forking almost always create more problems than they solve. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:11
This is bull. There's bitcoin.org, it has articles regarding bitcoin. It's the "official" site.

Incorrect. All major LN implementations are compatible. Here is the site thats set up to show the progress on this topic 
It's like the internet. There are thousands of ISPs but since they can't operate unless they are interconnected they will always endeavor to have good links between themselves. There might be a market for intentionally disconnected LNs for perhaps games or gambling but the main payment layer will be unified.


Yes mostly


Who "runs" the internet? Who "runs" bitcoin mining? It's a network not a singular service. Anyone can set up a LN hub if you have some coin. I will most likely try to run a node myself.


There's zero issues with a "big organisation" running a LN hub. It's trustless and tor routed. If a big company, like an exchange or payment processor, wants to run a highly interconnected node/hub that's just good for everyone. You see a LN hub just relays your payments. They don't control your money.


Every node in a LN would have a fee structure. Fees will change over time depending on how the channels are balanced. If my channel to A is almost fully on side A and my channel to B is almost fully at my side then my node would lower fees for transactions from A to B and raise fees for transactions from B to A. Every node will do this and publish fees which will let clients find the cheapest route through the LN.
Fees will be in the millisatoshi range so even multiple hops will be dirt cheap. Since a LN transaction is cheap computationally and bandwidth wise there is very little operative costs in running a LN node. Just like miners collect fees for transactions they put in a block, LN node runners will collect a small fee for every transaction they route. A big highly interconnected node will get more fees but will also have to have more bitcoin in open channels since every channel is multidirectional and the protocol currently calls for symmetrical setups.

Nope, I'm avidly against the stupid takeover attempt that was segwit2x but I'm in no way thinking the current mempool is good for bitcoin. No one is.
The real issue is that the solution isn't to just up the blocksize whenever the pool fills up. It's a bandaid on a broken bone, it doesn't fix the issue.
The chain actually has the capacity to handle the current transaction needs if just the main transacters would use the available tools like segwit and multipart transactions.
It's better to have these growing pains now than in a few years when people actually live on bitcoin.
But no the current mempool is fucked.

I somewhat agree here. It's completely okay for a transaction of this magnitude to take many days, especially when the markets are acting as they are. It is however extremely unprofessional to not keep the customer informed about what exactly is going on.
I also have a large (for me) transaction waiting in Bitstamp and the process is incredibly opaque with just a standard "in process" status message for many days now. I'm not worried yet but I appreciate reading OPs post as it gives me an indication of what's happening.

You don't have to close channels just to do maintenance unless your system is going to be down for weeks or something. While you have to be online to use LNs the channels only need watching periodically.

Consensus is the process used to descide about validity of the database. A majority is needed to achieve consensus. The words are related but not the same. They do imply the other. You can't have consensus without the majority and you can't have a majority without consensus.
Bcash willingly broke consensus and forked off their chain, they have willingly chosen to not be bitcoin anymore. That's why bcash is no longer a part of this sub. 
Bcash is a cryptocurrency that describes itself by what it isn't. I t doesn't have segwit, it doesn't have RBF and it doesn't have a 1mb blocksize. I personally find this outlook boring and uninspired. Bcash does nothing that other alt-coins can't do better. It has no merits.
If it isn't bitcoin, doesn't have any exceptional merits and isn't pegged to bitcoin then it just doesn't belong in this subreddit.
I call it bcash because I don't think it's bitcoin. It's quite simple really.

Lightning is offloading, not replacing, regular transactions. Bitcoin on lightning is just as much bitcoin as bitcoin on the blockchain is. There are other layers in development that will make it feasible to have bitcoin completely off-chain but still being secured by the decentralized system that is the blockchain.
As long as your coins were created on the blockchain at some point and your ownership of the coins are secured by hard math they are still digital cash. 
You can still send messages directly to computers via telnet over tcp/ip. But most people use layers on top like email, Facebook, whatsapp or Twitter. It's still the internet and it will still be bitcoin. Layering doesn't ruin the base layer, layering enhances the base layer. The base layers job is to be secure and robust. Bitcoin is secure and robust. High fees are an issue, centralization is doom.

at those sizes it isn't storage or even transmission that's the problem, it's the validation. The amount of processor power needed to validate every block in less than 10 minutes would be astronomical. And if anyone wanted to set up a node they would probably never catch up until the heat death of the universe.
Also transmission of these blocks around the world in less than 10 minutes is going to be very very complex.

I haven't seen anything pointing to mimblewimble being possible to add to bitcoin. It's a completely different system that at most could be implemented as a sidechain. And since bitcoin doesn't have any kind of two way pegging that's not going to be secure nor trustless.
There will be tech for filling and emptying your LN channels and there will be tech for switching atomically to other LNs built upon other cryptocurrencies.

Liquid blocks, liquid handling, corrosion, blockage, a mess to swap out and so on. Miners are made to be as cheap as possible. It's probably more cost effective to just use massive fans to move the heat.
Submersion cooling for servers is possible but the liquid is very expensive.
Mining is a race to the bottom with rather small margins, no one is going to spend an additional 5% or so just to run cooler.

It would take a rather large server farms longer than the universe has left to exist to guess a single wallet if it's seeded randomly (which the good ones are).
Quantum computers might at some point in the future be able to decrypt bitcoin wallets but the current tech is absolutely nowhere near that capability in any way. If at any point quantum computers are closing in on the bitcoin encryption standard we will have to fork to a new more quantum hardened format.
Now wallets can get hacked. Poorly written software or poor key security practices are the usual culprits. No one can crack your keys but anyone can install a keylogger or screen capture software.
The best security advice is to get a hardware wallet and to never ever keep your seed words in a digital format.

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:39:20
my guess is probably not. Everything that bitcoin smart contracts can ever be able to do Ethereum will probably do slightly better due to Ethereum being made as a smart contract platform from the start.
This is of course conditioned on Ethereums ability to survive some rather complex challenges in the near term. If eth manages to transition to proof of stake and sharding it will become extremely powerful in a way that bitcoin just can't compete with directly.
But then again the atomic cross chain currency swaps that are coming up will make jumping between chains a breeze. It might even be useful to have a store of value chain like bitcoin and a smart contract chain like eth separate.

I am a part of the bcash community and I don't find it offensive. The word has no offensive connotations. It doesn't look like another offensive word, it doesn't sound like an offensive word. It isn't aimed at a specific race or creed. It's a simple shortening of the base name chosen to avoid confusion. 
The only reason people are offended is because bcash really really want to be bitcoin. And that just isn't a justifiable reason because bitcoin already exists. So if the reason you don't want your current nickname is because you're trying to steal someone else's nickname then you have no case.

It might be complex but I suspect it will be a necessity. Also as I said if you could have conditionals in the hardware the node could be set to never send without at the same time reviving.

Covert asicboost has never been provably used. There are currently no mining hardware known that can produce covert asicboost blocks since it requires a lot of memory unless you're mining empty blocks.

Overt blocks are technically breaking the protocol and we really should get some UASF together to start excluding those blocks.

An empty block can always be a misconfigured miner. There where a couple of empty blocks during the bitcoin cash fork as pools didn't have their switching software up to speed.
There's also a couple of empty blocks now and then because a miner will be mining an empty block at first until the controller has assembled the next possible block and that takes a bit of time.
Most of all I don't think the advantages of speed with covert asicboost wouldn't offset the loss of fees from an empty block.
I know it goes against the narrative here but as far as I know it has never been proven that the hardware for covert asicboost with full blocks even exist.

1. LN is for instant payments when both parties are online. Like buying coffee, games, media and everything over the internet.
2. You can decide upon your timeouts yourself. You only need to go online at most once every timeout period to check for fraudulent behavior. In reality this means that fraudulent behavior is high risk low reward. This makes fraudulent behavior very rare.
Your LN wallet on your phone do not need to be always online. The LN wallet that Starbucks runs will be always online. The LN node that you run from home to make a few satoshis will be always online.
If you need to keep channels open while you are offline because of traveling or similar you will need to use a watchtower. This tower can be an online service or you can run it yourself on your home computer.
If you offload most web purchases, most small item physical purchases and all media streaming purchases you will significantly reduce the transactions in regular blocks. Thus LN is a kind of scaling.
Sadly you are approaching the subject from the wrong angle, the LN isn't supposed to do the things you think it's bad at.
At every point you can always fall back to the regular blockchain. Once we reach the blockchain capacity despite all the different optimizations with schnorr, LN, sidechains and other things it's completely okay to increase the block size since by then every increase will be a lot more effective.

No. Mcafee hasn't been the ceo of a well-known antiviral company for a very long time. He was out of that game in the 90s (possibly early 2000s). He's been a figure in bitcoin for a reasonable amount of time. 
The hacking challenge was very specific. You could buy a wallet with something like $10 in bitcoin on it and you would get the reward if you managed to get the coins out. You don't get any rewards for getting the wallet to run doom or any other shenanigans, only getting the coins out. So far no one has done that. The wallet might still be shit for a myriad of other reasons but the challenge is very clear. And the rules were set from the start as far as I know.
Also Mcafee is an extremely paranoid, eccentric and weird person who is very likely to have paid some Belize thugh to torture and murder his neighbor.

This. People don't seem to realize that decentralization isn't the end, it's a means to an end. Decentralization is used to achieve resistance to censorship and attacks.
Decentralization by itself is actually a cost for the system, it makes the database a lot less effective and it severely limits capacity. 
That's also what many don't understand about LNs. LNs will likely become more centralized, since that's more efficient. But it doesn't matter since the security and anti-censorship model is based on the regular blockchain. As long as the base system has censorship protection and extremely high security it's perfectly fine to sacrifice some of that to make layers above more efficient.

A LN node needs to be able to sign transactions in real time. Thus it needs the keys to all your channels online. If someone gets a hold of your keys your money is gone. A full bitcoin node doesn't have to have a wallet or funds to work in any way.
Most serious bitcoin users keep their keys on hardware wallets or other offline/airgapped storage. It might be possible to make hardware wallets for LN that could be locked down to prevent rapid emptying of channels or so but it would have to be physically connected to the node at all times.

What you are talking about is called an Oracle. It's an unbiased source of outside information for smart contracts to use. This is a major area of research but it is not a simple problem.
It's absolutely solvable with a central authority but it may actually be solved in practice by using decentralized systems and aggregating many different sources. It's perhaps also feasible to appoint a random arbitrator on a case by case basis that is given the authority to judge if the event has actually happened. These judges could be verified by other judges and incentivized by payouts or by losing staked funds.

There are however many other coins with the same properties as bitcoin that can handle more transactions (and no, I'm not talking about the shitcoin that split off from bitcoin).
Trying to spin off a true weakness in the bitcoin system as if it's a magical feature that no other transactional system has is just weak. 
We need to explore multiple avenues of increasing throughput. A modest bump in block size is not automatically wrong. Heck, just having millions of people opening and closing a few LN channels each is going to fill the blocks even if we get all the MAST, Schnorr and friends we can get.
LN is the way forward for small/micro payments and future applications of streaming money. But it isn't the solution to scaling in itself.

You can't mine bitcoin with a regular computer. The purpose built machines are just so incredibly much more efficient. You will never break even with a gpu.
Now you can still mine other coins but the market have tanked lately. While most modern gpus will see you net positive after electricity costs you will still only earn fractions of dollars per card. 
There are two main ways to mine alts:
1. Pick an alt, mine, find an exchange that accepts your coin, sell coin or trade to something more stable.
2. Cloud mining, like nicehash, where you let other people decide what you mine in exchange for bitcoin or other "mainstream" cryptocurrencies.
Nicehash and friends is very simple to use, just install a software, run a benchmark, generate a wallet address for payment and press run. You won't make as much money of course since nicehash and the person renting mining capacity also gets a part of the profits. There was also the issue where nicehash was hacked and a lot of money got stolen but as far as I know NH has actually owned up to their mistake and are in the process of paying people back.
In almost every case it's better to just buy coins instead of mining them. Except for the massive crashes this year it has more or less always been more profitable to buy coins instead of buying gpus to mine.

It is usually but there is a special kind of investment account called an ISK (investment savings account) which are taxed at a fixed amount and not in regards to profit or loss. Inside the ISK you can trade and own stock, ETNs, funds, bonds and so on freely.

The downside is of course that you are taxed a fixed percentage even if you took losses during the fiscal year.

Downloading the entire blockchain takes some serious time already. But yes there seems to be an issue with nodes on eth not having the complete chain.
Then again many bitcoin wallets are SPV and as such have to have some trust as well. I just don't feel that the current bitcoin block size is optimal. We could easily increase it to say 2mb without ruining decentralization. On the other hand I fully understand the drive to optimize block usage before increasing the size.

Don't get me wrong here. I still think bitcoin is the gold standard regarding robustness but to believe that no other currencies can surpass bitcoin in features is just sticking your head in the sand.
It doesn't really matter why bitcoin has relatively low throughput, it's still a weakness. I understand and even agree with the reasoning but it's still a weakness. Trying to spin it as a feature won't change that.

It makes the punishment system for attempted fraud better. The watch towers don't need to store as much data and they will actually know less about your transactions. If fraud is very easy to catch and the punishment is severe then the likelihood of anyone even attempting fraud is minimal.
Protection from fraud is one of the cornerstones in the LN network since transactions are off chain.

This is incorrect. Getting everyone onto segwit will mean a de facto increase in block capacity. It's vitally important to get as many transactions as possible into the segwit format.
There will probably be another fee-pocalypse the next time bitcoin gets a massive bull or bear run.

In this case I feel that bcash did exactly what bitcoin was designed to resist. Someone tried to publish invalid blocks and call them bitcoin. It's exactly the kind of thing the consensus exists to prevent, and it did. Now a malicious site claims to be bitcoin central and that's also something that can be prevented by following best practices regarding software signature checks and to verify the blockchain in your own node.
The only legitimacy bcash has is that people here keeps talking about it as if it's a serious rival and not a small eccentric splinter.

Do you understand how the mining difficulty works? Miners produce blocks. No one else does. Without a new block every 10 minutes there is no bitcoin. Nodes as we talk about them now didn't even exist I'm the beginning. When Satoshi talked about nodes he meant mining nodes. Miners are also nodes.
If exchanges, users and non-mining nodes were to break off from the miners or even a moderate percentage of miners the time between blocks would skyrocket until the difficulty could be fixed. If most miners were to be left out then the chain would just halt. 
But any user who sent his transaction to the miners mempool would get his transactions. So there's no conceivable scenario where everyone just decides to  effectively kill bitcoin just to spite miners.
Miners are the backbone of bitcoin. Miners are bitcoin. Unless you mine you are not in control of bitcoin, you're a user of bitcoin. Exchanges and users will follow the miners not the other way around.

Personally I think that's inexcusable unless done extremely transparently in order to say stop spam or similar. Using mod powers to further agendas is categorically wrong. Reddit is a forum for free and open discussion. Many agitators on the BU side have acted like complete asshats but that does not give the r/bitcoin mods the right to do what they demonstrably have done.

There is really nothing stopping bitcoin from going to zero. I don't think it's likely but it isn't impossible.
Bitcoin is high risk/high reward and if you are looking at it as an investment you should treat it like any other high risk commodity. Buy slowly over time and try not to panic in dips. Keep your portfolio balanced. If you have too much value in bitcoin you should move some to more low risk investments.

Bitcoin can not compete with that as every transaction needs to be signed with a proof of work that always have a real world cost.

While I agree that core and have been far to heavy-handed in this matter I really wonder how the people can realistically claim bitcoin is failing while it's in an all time high in almost every possible metric.
And even if we were to have an alternative to core it's really obvious that BU isn't that alternative. It's poorly maintained, poorly tested and it's really even more closed and heavy-handed than core. Even if you disagree with core how can switching to something measurably worse be a good idea?

First mover advantage is everything here. No one builds a completely separate road system, no one build their own internet. Practically every solution another sidechain uses can be adapted into Bitcoin if they ever become a credible threat.
No one is arguing Bitcoin doesn't need to be fixed though. It's just that cores solution is vastly superior to the alternatives. I'm not sure soft fork segwit is the optimal solution but none of the others are even close.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:52:49
but that would require side channel communication between nodes and miners and so on. It's anathema to everything bitcoin is. It's supposed to be trustless. If all miners have to communicate like this you suddenly have to trust. It's just ugly.
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:45:29
I'm not trying to start a fight here but it seems that you don't really grasp how bitcoin work. We don't trust miners. Bitcoin is trustless. You can not fake a blockchain. The magic of blockchain technology is that proof-of-work means that no one can fake a blockchain unless they have more than 50 percent of the combined mining power.
Miners can not "cheat". You have to do the actual work to get the actual coins. A database can be modified, the blockchain can not. The blockchain is provable all the way back to the genesis block. A miner that tries to publish a cheat block will not be accepted by the rest of the miners or clients because the math won't add up. 
There aren't enough computing power in the world to roll back the blockchain, change a transaction, and roll it up again as long as the miners keep adding to it. It's how the bitcoin secure transaction system works. Completely decentralized trustless transactions.
If you have trust in one entity you have a bank. Banks work just fine but they are not bitcoin.

Miners are *also* nodekeepers. We don't actually need other nodekeepers than the miners. You can't publish blocks if you don't have a full node. 
But miners aren't a cooperative. They are competing against each other. Bitcoin was created to solve the byzantine generals problem and it does so by math and ensured self-interest. Miners can ruin bitcoin but as long as more than half don't want that the system will be fine. 
The blockchain is a list that's passed around every 10 minutes. But in order to add transaction and get the newly minted coins you have to do some work that takes about a specific amount of time. The proof-of-work is the key to bitcoin. It ensures that no one can fake a chain or transaction. Miners do the PoW. Not exchanges, not nodes, not users. 
There is no other "communication" in bitcoin other than publishing a block. Without miners there is no "communication". You can publish a transaction to the mempool but until it's incorporated into a block it isn't valid or useful. 
Nodes keep a record of the blockchain and acts as relays. They are useful but not necessary. The rest of the network won't even really see what kind of chain the node supports since that data is baked into blocks and nodes do not create any blocks. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:21:02
It's not safe to say. Bitcoin can not be predicted. If it could be predicted someone would make a lot of money on he prediction thus changing he predicted outcome. Bitcoin might go down do 700 or 400 or 0. It might never again drop below 1000. Nothing is safe to say.
There are almost certainly entites buying up large swaths of coin to either use as some kind of leverage or to portion up and sell to others or as an investment. There are likely thousands of people who can spend 300k dollars without even breaking a sweat.

They stopped cash withdraws claiming regulatory issues but really they just didn't have any cash. They were as far as I understand trying to make enough money on their own trades to keep themselves solvent. Didn't work.
Bitcoin in and out worked pretty well until the actual collapse and I also think Japanese customers were getting cash out as well.
I didn't get out at the very end but I did have funds on gox that I tried to get to my bank account.

You need really really cheap electricity to make money mining. Like living next to a hydroelectric plant in China cheap. You also need to invest quite a lot in dedicated mining hardware and if you're unlucky you will never even break even.
Mining on a computer either CPU or GPU is a complete no-go. Although there are some alternative cryptocurrencies where you might be able to make some money but it's really sketchy. 
If you plan to start getting some coin then get a hardware wallet as soon as you reach an amount where the loss of the coins will be painful. And once you get the hardware wallet be sure to follow the instructions carefully and even try to do a restore once so you can get a feel for the procedure.

This is of course a problem. But it's a solvable problem. Micro transactions can be solved with sidechains, trusted address and other things. Trust can be solved by third party observers. There could even be a new market in having humans observe and report if work is done satisfactory. Also review sites could easily be made machine accessible. And since it's your property you could sue if the contractors didn't perform. 
Truth is we as humans already accept an enormous amount of transactions on faith alone. Everytime you hire a specialist you also have to trust his work. Machines will have the advantage of not being emotional when hiring or evaluating work. This will never be a perfect system, but the again nothing ever is.
This vision does require a better bitcoin protocol. The blockchain has to become more flexible. I'm no expert by far but from what I gather we need to have more possible transaction per time frame and a solid way of cutting non-relevant information out of the chain. If bitcoin replaces swift and we need commercial payment-processors as go-betweens then what's the point? I personally belive that micro transactions will be the most important area for cryptocurrency. Shuffling a few cents forward and backwards between systems for services rendered could revolutionize the world. At the very least it would eliminate email-spam :)

Yes. But it wouldn't ever happen since the incentives are not there. You can't make money out of nothing. If you suddenly double the amount you would halve the worth. 
Miners are a large heterogenous group all motivated by self interest. If some miners broke off to mine 50btc blocks the other miners would get more regular blocks so there would be no incentive to switch and the offshoot miners would get worthless blocks.
Exchanges are important as well of course. Miners often need to sell coin to pay for electricity. But end users and  nodekeepers are actually not in the decision loop at all.
Bitcoin is built upon decentralized rational self-interest. If 75% of miners wanted a change they could have a change. They would have an incentive to get the rest of the ecosystem onboard first or they would be losing money. But they could. If you hold more than 50% of the combined computational power your decide the rules of bitcoin. It's that simple.

No lightning is trustless. You need to be able to watch the blockchain during an open contract so that no one tries to trick you but this isn't something that you need real time access to do.

In what way do you think the nodes can influence this? Miners are bitcoin. Nodes are just note keepers. A node that don't "accept" the current chain is no longer a bitcoin node. Users of bitcoin only need to be able to send their transactions to miners, nothing else. There will be support for segwit or bu in most clients when the eventual fork occur. 
Nodes have no power. All signaling is done in the blocks by miners. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:00:42
I do. I've read both sides argument and I think segwit while increasing complexity is the correct way to go. Although I'd rather have a hard segwit fork so we can drop backwards compatability crud.
Segwit helps hardware wallets, segwit addresses some malleabillity bugs, segwit enables secure off-chain micro transactions and it increases the block size.
There are real valid criticisms of segwit but I don't think they outweigh the benefits in any way.
I feel that mostly the resistance is people feeling steam rolled and miners who are afraid they will miss out on revenue once the lightning networks are up.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:40:57
The what now? Bitcoin repository?
You are confusing bitcoin with the development of the bitcoin client. Individual clients are developed by teams and some teams works best with a dedicated leader. Bitcoin itself has no leader, it shouldn't have. 
Bitcoin itself is a consensus, whatever protocol is used by most miners IS bitcoin. There's a system in place for proposing changes to the protocol for sure but until it's actually implemented by miners it's just suggestions.

Yes, it "costs" nothing for paypal to move money from one database entry to another. They charge you for the privilege but that's not the same.
The argument was bitcoin competing with a trusted party like paypal. Bitcoin can never be cheaper in a direct competition. It is physically impossible. Now today Bitcoin isn't large enough or well used enough to even begin to compete with say paypal or visa or other trust-based value transmitters. But once it is those services can always undercut Bitcoin on transmission fee. Bitcoin has other properties that will hopefully make it the system of choice but in any case it will provide a baseline that the big providers have to crawl under which will be a net win for everyone.
Currently PayPal and friend overcharge you because they can. Once bitcoin has real traction they won't be able to. But they can still transmit funds cheaper than bitcoin because their "actual cost" is close to zero. Bitcoins "actual cost of transmission" will always be a combination of: 
* the value of the electricity used to mine the block
* fees collected in block
* bitcoin created in block
* number of transactions in block
* miner profit
* miner investment in hardware
in a self balancing system because no one mines for free. Once the block rewards approaches zero the fees will have to pick up the slack. Therefore Bitcoin can never be as free as a simple sql statement like for Paypal.

There should be a yearly standards review setting the 1 BTC to the value closest to a medium of 1 of the other large currencies. In steps of a thousand.

What are you talking about? Lightning networks need the malleabillity fix not segwit. Current implementations use segwit but it isn't necessary. Malleabillity is a bug that should be fixed regardless. Because it's a bug.
Segwit helps speed up the chain for hw wallets and adds the ability to prune the blockchain once the witness data is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-02-19 09:12:44
Segwit is a new on-chain transaction type. It works mostly like today's transactions but it fixes malleabillity and helps hardware wallets.
The lightning network is based on segwit transactions because LN is vulnerable to transaction malleabillity. But it is actually possible to build a LN network on top of normal transactions it just wouldn't work as well.
Lightning networks and segwit are not the same and can exist without the other.

Bitcoins closest competitor only has about 7% of bitcoins cap and Eth is still a very untested beast. It might have a lot of potential but I haven't seen any actual practical use for eth yet.

You could conceivably build a new mining client that is hard-coded to start working from an earlier block disregarding every block after. As long as more than 51% of miners do this the new chain will become the right chain and once the new chain is longer than the old the other 49% will switch over as well. In a large economic system like bitcoin that is almost impossible to do though.

This is an important point. But as we all know it takes a lot of computing powered before a blockchain becomes secure. A consensus based system can always be modified if there is a consensus. The point of this he blockchain is that the consensus to change is so hard to achieve that it's practically impossible to do it in a fraudulent manor.
Technically the bitcoin blockchain could be rolled back an arbitrary amount of blocks if you owned the majority of miners for a significant amount of time.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:03:08
yea the financial sector isn't going to just pack up and die because of bitcoin. The financial sector is very adaptable and has a lot of resources. Our best hope is that we can use the blockchain to clean up some of the shadier practices and to streamline the current systems better. I think we'll see the waiting times for transaction of fiat over borders drop significantly over the coming years and so on.
I don't realistically see the blockchain taking over in the near future but it will prove to be a significant pressure on the current systems.

Mining is not anonymous. You can see which IPs that transmit a finished block. And if several finished blocks originates from one point it's a farm or a pool. Most pools are public as they want more members. 
Also miners have to sell their coins to pay for electricity and hardware. Tracking where the new coins are being sold gives further information.
To make money mining you need large setups at this point.
Bitcoin is not anonymous.

Bitcoin is conservative and secure. These are properties I value with my money. Bitcoin doesn't have front figures. Ask yourself, why do you want your currency to have leaders?

No there aren't. There are some public figures, for sure, but outside Satoshi himself there are none that you can be sure most bitcoin users would have even heard of. 
It's very hard to find someone using eth who don't have some idea about who Vitalik is and litecoiners know about Charlie. You can't hang around in bcash circles without drowning in Ver propaganda or even CSW. But bitcoin? I've been into bitcoin since I first read about it on Slashdot back in 2009 or something and even now I barely know anything about Hal or Nick. I mean I sometimes read about different devs or early contributors but to claim they are front figures? Nope. Bitcoin is thankfully too large and too decentralized for that.
You are free to choose who you believe are the top dogs in bitcoin but as long as 80% of the users won't give the exact same names there are no front figures.

@_date: 2016-06-18 13:16:45
Well that's because human words are not exactly defined. There are real problems with interpretation and meaning especially over time. This is not an issue with computer code. Computer languages are written to always have an exact unambiguous meaning. If you write your contract in code there is no alternative interpretation. There can be no intent different from the letter. There is no grey area in code. And as such there can never be any "intent defence" in public smart contracts. It even says so on the DAOs site that the attacker quotes.
Rolling back or forking or selectively mining are the "crimes" here not the "attacker" using a smart contract to his advantage. It's sad for the DAO and it's investors but people lose money on weird schemes all the time. It's a part of life. If you invest in a system free from politics and centralization you should absolutely not try to use politics and centralization to fix your issues when you fuck up.

It can be anonymous. Just like bitcoin can be anonymous with mixers and localcoins and so on. It doesn't mean that it is anonymous automatically. Forensic analysis can come a long way. Miners have to get fiat to pay for electricity. If new adresses goes to yuan exchanges they're probably Chinese miners. To much obfuscation and someone else might beat your block to the chain as well.
But yes mining is often more anonymous than buying bitcoin and using them.

Not sure. There are many projects going on in the eth sphere and I suppose some would qualify as similar. My thoughts are that since eth is more programmatically complete it can likely have sidechains with a 2way peg without having to use federated trust.
There is a definite effort on eth to experiment with sharding where you split the main chain into multiple smaller chains to increase capacity but that's not really the same as liquid.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:19:15
Bitcoin only exist on Liquid once locked. liquid is expressively stated to be able to handle multiple different tokens (and/or coins). And it's supposed to be able to do this anonymously.
I hade hoped exchanges would move to more open transparent ways of doing business, not the other way.
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:50:41
Liquid is a sidechain and as such it's a kind of layer 2 mechanism just like LN. But that's more or less the only similarities.
LN is a micropayment system that relies upon a network of payment channels that are based on timelocked bitcoin transactions. Payments are instant and peer to peer. Large transactions and routing through the network of channels is not easy to solve but will likely work better and better as tech advances.
Liquid is a sidechain with its own blockchain that enable large players to transfer funds between themselves faster and more anonymously than on-chain. Money is moved to to liquid via timelocked transactions but the system isn't based on payment channels at all. Payments are similar to regular bitcoin payments but the blocktime is something like 2 minutes and it doesn't rely on proof of work like bitcoin does.
LN relies upon a trustless model where every transaction is a balance between two party channels. Both of which have the ability to cash out a channel at any time (with a delay if non-consensual).
Liquid relies on a federation of trusted peers in order to transfer bitcoin out of the network. As long as more than 2/3s of the network are honest it will work fine. This also makes it possible to have other tokens on liquid that aren't bitcoin nor are based on bitcoin like shares or tokens representing other real world assets. The controllers of the liquid network can freely add and remove whatever tokens that they want. Liquid can't create any new bitcoin though as every transaction out of liquid has to be taken from the pool of funds that were transferred in.

We don't know if this is a bubble or a correction but the fact is that China is driving up the price and the speculators are following suit. Bitcoin needs to have a much larger market cap in order to really be useful in countries with wonky currencies like Venezuela and India so these rises are necessary.

2x or realistically 8x as it is in practice isn't about changing a number. It has never been about changing a number. It's a political attack designed to get control over the reference design and the name bitcoin.
If the players were truly interested in increasing throughput then segwit would have been activated a long time ago and then plans for an eventual hard fork could begin.

Some things can't be tested unless actually rolled out. These things will become political and philosophy based. Without hard data people have to rely on speculation. Both segwit and big blocks are such changes. If it was possible to prove one side was better this argument wouldn't exist.
Now bitcoin isn't just a software project, it's a massively distributed consensus that could easily be umendably broken by a close to 50-50 hard fork. In regular software the two sides would just go their separate ways but in bitcoin it isn't that easy as your coins would in essence get duplicated. This wrecks havoc with valuation and system stability. Just look at the eth mess.
In most regular OS software you have a group of maintainers with pull access that decides what goes into the software or not. In bitcoin we have multiple different groups that have major influence: Core devs, miners, the big exchanges/businesses, node runners and users. If consensus is not reached or if one of these groups try to strong arm unpopular changes the results can be devastating.
Bitcoin isn't software, it's consensus and math.

I believe in bitcoin and I have been into coins ever since I first heard about them back when you could mine them on your CPU.

On that I completely agree. The current bitcoin is too clunky to use. Paying someone 0.03BTC is just bad usability. 
But I actually feel that we should have a system for reconfiguring the base bitcoin to something close to say the average of dollars, pounds and euro. So that once we reach a somewhat stable 1000$ we should switch 0.001 btc to 1 btc. Other currencies has done this before.

The reason why they want to move to larger blocks this fast are a bit murky. I think. I mean the fees are still not a major part of earnings and full blocks leads to higher fees anyway.
Miner centralization is a big flaw in bitcoin that Satoshi and the other early devs didn't predict. The thinking was that every miner would compete with each other in a global decentralized system. But then someone figured out mining pools and suddenly the actual actors at the top level became rather few. If there were no pools there is just no functional way for miners to be a coherent group but with pools we suddenly have "miner opinions".
I am very weary about a system where the miners have control over the protocol. What miners want is not exactly what the network needs.
Miners are supposed to compete in an open market, not become cartells. And they definitely are not supposed to dictate the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:06:45
The power of bitcoin is as an immutable transaction record free from governmental control. It's a global approach to money that's aimed at removing power from those who manipulate national economies for political and profiteering reasons.
That's why decentralization is the absolute most important thing. Without centralization bitcoin can be killed by a few targeted attacks.
The paying for coffee, smart contracts, liquidity systems and such can be built on top of the blockchain as soon as segwit activates.
Nodes are the most important thing. The base layer has to be extremely resilient. High bandwidth, high throughput, specialized systems can be built on top of bitcoin. It is not a good idea to build them inside bitcoin.
If this means that the blockchain itself only becomes a settlement layer and a way for rich entities to transport large sums of money then that's ok. It means that bitcoin has won.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:17:45
The whole point of lightning is to not send coins p2p. You have one or more channels open to hubs and those hubs have large channels to other hubs or to the merchant directly. It's just like a debit card account or similar but you don't have to trust the hubs. Your money is secured all the way to the recipient and if a hub is acting in bad faith you can close the channel on the blockchain.
And since bitcoin is deflationary your coin will increase in value while sitting in a channel just as If they were in a bank account.

No the split won't kill asicboost, Segwit will make hidden asicboost impossible. The split has neither removed nor helped segwit. The split will not decentralize anything unless your definition of decentralization is chaos. 
Dev power isn't a factor, that's correct. Most of the work on most cryptocurrencies is based on core anyhow. 
The waste of resources is mostly that we suddenly have multiple separate systems doing the job that one should do. We suddenly have multiple payment options, multiple wallet branches, multiple information storage sites and multiple community conflicts. This is waste. Everytime I want to send funds or have to explain cryptos I will have to waste time explaining or choosing which chain to use. It's is the absolute worst thing about open source. To fracture instead of working together when division occur isn't a good thing. Everything gets diluted and efforts gets wasted.

No those are two different concepts.
Liquid uses the trusted peers for both adding blocks, thus securing the chain, as well as returning funds to the blockchain. It's completely possible to build a side chain that uses regular Proof of Work for security and trusted peers for returning coin.
The only way to be able to return coins without trusted peers is if the regular blockchain is changed to allow it to communicate with side chains directly. And to do that you need some kind of transaction script that can access outside data and bitcoin has no such op-codes.

It isn't cryptographically backed by bitcoin at all. Once you are on Liquid it's completely up to the Liquid security model if you can ever get any coins out. There's no automatic fall back like with LN. Once you send your funds to a Liquid gateway adress you only have trust securing the eventual return or use of your funds. It's possible for Liquid to be very secure in itself but it isn't based on the bitcoin blockchain.
On the spectrum of centralization a federated system like Liquid is a hell of a lot more centralized than the bitcoin blockchain.

Because while Liquid has a lot of desireable properties for a business (fast, anonymous) it has plenty of extremely undesirable properties for end users (centralized, gated, proprietary).

The problem as I see with the live and let live philosophy is that if everyone is looking out for no.1 no one can look out for all of us. 
If people were logical self determined individuals it would be one thing but it's painfully apparent that we're not. Now don't get me wrong. I absolutely belive in personal freedom and the right to do what you will as long as you're not damaging others but macroeconomic planning isn't something best left up to the individual.
I don't care what you do with yourself or with other consenting adults. I don't care what you think or say. I do care about you contributing your share to the advancement of human kind.
The terror craze, the surveillance society, the closed borders, the more police/harder punishment zero tolerance bullshit is just a symptom of governments being afraid of it's people.
But that doesn't automatically mean that states are a bad thing, that governments are evil. Our current system, though certainly flawed, has brought with it the greatest period of prosperity humanity has ever witnessed. 
We have less crime, less violence, better education, better health, longer lives than anytime before. No matter what the pundits want you to think.
We the people have to be vigilant in face of those who want to pervert out institutions but that doesn't mean that it's right to not pay taxes. You have a responsibility to your fellow man, you have a responsibility to contribute your part.
The amount of cooperation needed to get us out into the galaxy is not possible with a live and let live philosophy. Giving part of your efforts to the collective is not slavery it's citizenship.

Discussion with people who don't have the same opinions as you do are the most rewarding and most important. If you at any point in your life start believing you have all the answers and that arguing with opponents is meaningless you have lost at life. The whole point in being an enlightened intelligent individual is to be able to change as you learn.
Now to the arguments. There is a strong anti eu sentiment in the EU. It's more or less always been there. Lately it has been fueled by the refugee crisis and Russian money. It's far far from a majority though.
The EU was created because we had had two world wars that killed millions of people and caused incalculable damage. We realized that tying the continent together with trade was a realistic way to prevent war. 
The EU is transitioning from being under minister control to being controlled by the elected European Parliament. A democratically elected governing body. 
Most countries have to rewrite their constitution to leave the eu as they had to change it in the first place in order to join. Most countries don't see their constitution as inviolate truth but rather a set of laws that are harder to change. Almost all democracies have well established ways to change their constitution. In my country we only need two voted in Parliament with an election in between.
For me the current most important role of the EU is to standardize laws regarding products and sales and to make sure that our laws are consumer centric not corporation centric. It is massively useful In getting corporations to behave. If we say children's toys have to be measurably poison free to be allowed in the chances are a lot higher that this will be the case.
But most of all I realize that we only have one planet and we're all the same species and the only way for us to not be all wiped out is if we can come together. Giving up certain lawmaking rights in order to be part of something greater is a basic function of human society. You do it when you choose not to live in the forest on your own. The larger the organization the less individual power you have. It's a trade off but for me it's worth it. At least up to a point.
The basic ideals of the EU are some that I share. The four freedoms are extremely important. Isolationism is the thing that can actually lead to us destroying ourselves and our world.

It's still small enough to game with a lot of spending cash and anonymous enough for us the have a hard time finding out who and decentralized enough for us to know where.
A currency that can fluctuate many percents over a day are worthless to store owners and similar. That's why most retailers use some kind of direct to fiat system.
But somehow, magically, it still works and it still has trust. I really hope we can get past the fluctuations and other economical weirdness and into stable currency territory in a few years.

Sure it's a bit over the top. But it is meant to describe the position we're in if business interests control the protocol. The fact is that core devs were specifically excluded in the NYA. I don't think we'll see any as overt attacks as a reward change but miners were never supposed to have legislative powers. They were supposed to signal readiness and nothing else. The entire line of thought "the miners want" is anthema to bitcoin.
The system isn't designed with miners as a political entity in mind. I fail to see any way that miner controlled protocol is good for me as an end user. Can you please explain why you think it's a good idea. Or perhaps a well researched opinion about why the miners don't hold any political power in the 2x movement.

Without miners you can't transact. The act of mining is the actual engine that drives bitcoin. If enough miners leave for 2x, bitcoin will grind to a halt. There is a system for balancing the system according to amount of miners but it isn't fast enough to handle quick and massive losses of hashrate.
Miners make money by mining blocks. But the fees you pay to get into a block isn't a major part of the rewards yet. So miners mine the chain that pays best rewards not the one with the most transactions.

The entity that produces the settling transaction, I think. If it's a time locked transaction it's already paid for when it sets up.
LN is based on timed transactions that are unspendable until X blocks have past. It's set up so that your funds return to you if the hub does nothing. If the hub tries to take your funds you have until the timer is out to just make a transaction reclaiming your funds. Except the ones that have already been spent successfully.

No those are two dependent things. They just aren't exactly one to one.
You still can't buy electricity with coin. Mining uses electricity. Miners mine to get money. Therefore the more mining being done the more the miners will need exchanges and buyers. This stimulates the economy as a whole. Also more miners means better security and probably more public interest. All av these things affect the exchange rate.

You are wrong. The DAO site specifically says that if the site and the actual code disagree then it's the code that is valid. Thus there can be no other intent than the actual letter of the contract. Any action the contract can do is permissible.

Nice straw-man, dude! I almost wish you'd brought out an empty chair to argue against.
But really let's just answer some of your claims here. As they're written sarcastically it might look a bit weird.


You can absolutely send stocks to people. If you have it on paper you can mail it otherwise you can send it electronically in a multitude of ways. Many large corporations do use stocks as payment. Both to their employees and when purchasing large assets. 


In essence correct. Many people uses stocks or mutual funds based on stocks as a hedge. Companies that only uses stocks as payment is a stretch though but then again the companies that only uses bitcoin and bitcoin alone are extremely few.


Stocks are decentralized. Non exchange tradable companies often have them on paper. That's the most decentralized thing imaginable. Many many companies have been run into the ground, but so have many many cryptocurrencies as well. Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency that hasn't (yet?) failed but there are probably millions of companies that haven't failed either.


You actually believe being able to exist for what eight years is some kind of proof that you're invulnerable? You don't think there are companies that manage to turn a profit even in the large economic crises? 
And lastly do you actually believe that bitcoin having 15 billion in market cap means that people have actually invested 15 billion? Do you? Because in that case you're somewhat a danger to yourself at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:30:49
I'm thinking control. If you have control over the network you stand to make a ridiculous amount of money in time. As long as your conquest doesn't ruin the currency first. The problem with large systems like bitcoin is that no single person can predict or steer it. So it never looks like a master plan because it's a result of many people's master plans clashing.
What is true is that some Chinese miner producer has a "hack" that let's these machines, when unlocked by proprietary means, mine bitcoin in a way that's bad for the network but good for the miner. What is true is that there are some serious brigading going on. There seems to be a concerted effort to paitn core as some monolithic entity that's trying to do something evil. When from what I gather core is the standard open source loose gathering of coders trying to produce a good product. What is also true is that core feels that a hard fork is more or less never an option. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:56:47
Yes, I won't exactly like it if it happens since I feel that core knows the best way forward but the most important thing is consensus and hashpower. I will however wait a while to let the market stabilize before calling it but if a protocol extension hard fork follows the best practices (bip, discussion, reasonable signaling majority and so on) I will absolutely support that as the real bitcoin chain.
I'm not against larger blocks, at all. I want segwit for the malleabillity fix and discardable witness data. At some point we will absolutely need bigger blocks. I'm not qualified to say when and how much though.

They broke consensus without a the majority behind them, they disregard the longest chain. They lower the difficulty in unorthodox ways. They use real dates and times as triggers instead of on-chain events like block height. Block height is an absolute consensus value, datetimes are subjective.
In fact increasing blocksize isn't violating the original idea. Increasing it without consensus is a violation.

I did watch the keynote where the authors presented the thing. How would someone steal your funds? I admit I don't have a code-level knowledge of the protocol but I've seen no way for someone to actually get the funds. If you're acting as an intermediate you do have to watch the chain but as an end user I really can't see how it would be done.
Do you have some kind of specific scenario where theft of funds would occur? It is my understanding that publishing on the chain would only be done when a bad actor refuses to do its part in the transaction chain and since all transactions are time locked the cascade would ensure that everyone could reclaim funds if something went wrong.

No, bitcoin is an infrastructure. Having competing non-compatible infrastructure is a BAD thing. It wastes resources and creates availability problems. You don't build two competing road systems, you don't build two separate water mains. Redundancy can be fine but separate systems are not redundancy if they don't work together. 
The optimal way to handle infrastructure is to have a neutral party own it and have the competition ON it.
For instance, broadband. Having ADSL, cable and fiber is not a good system. Some mediums only have one provider and some areas only have one medium. In my country here has been a hard push for municipal broadband. The city builds fiber to every home and providers rent bandwidth and sells services. This has caused prices to drop and speeds to go up.
Multiple suppliers of incompatible infrastructure is unilaterally bad. It dilutes usability, causes confusion, increases complexity and leaves the entire system more vulnerable.
Competition ON infrastructure, services and goods, are good. Competition WITH infrastructure (xbox/ps, app store/Google store, vhs/betamax) is bad for end users, always. It doesn't cause competition,it causes exclusion.

LN is a level 2 solution. It isn't deployed on any net. As soon as some of the LN software goes stable you can start using it.
But first we need wallets that allows you to move funds to a segwit adress. And then we need a network of hubs. And merchants or services that accept LN. And software with nice guis.
Give it a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:44:43
None of this is certain but the proposed system is that the LN node fees are a function of how many new connections that node wants. Once liquidity of the node starts drying up, channel fees will increase until new channels select other nodes.
Since nodes trustworthiness is only measured in uptime and speed of transactions there's no reason to block nodes until they start acting up. Nodes can be semi anonymous and you don't actually have to trust them that much.
As a LN user your client will want a hub with good solid uptime but with low fees and few channels. There will be some very large hubs for sure but I think there might just be a possibility for people with nice uptime to run a small hub for profit.
To answer your questions:
1. Reputation is probably going to be some kind of shared system where nodes keep track of each other. Just setting up a node and proving availability would get you accepted. The network won't care who you are.
3. LN nodes do not take up a lot of resources at all. Not a lot of CPU and not a lot of bandwidth. It does take capital in the form of bitcoin to start channels.
4. Liquid, reputable hubs with few connections are prefered over saturated ones. It's expected that the LN network will look less like a standard spoke and more of a federated mesh net with some obvious main trunks. New nodes will be cheaper to use. As long as a node has a connection to one of the major trunks it will probably get connections. It might also be useful to connect to a "local" node as the fees for paying for a coffee will be lower the fewer nodes there are between you and the café.

Covert and overt asicboost while having similar mechanics have vastly different implementations. There's no hard evidence that covert asicboost has ever been used or even that modern mining hardware even can use it.

No we are not. There are some people who like liquid and there are some who has worked on it. Then there are many who don't care since it's not a trustless system and it isn't really Bitcoin.
I have heard almost no one that's purely ecstatic.
Liquid is primarily a network for exchanges, banks, financial institutions, high value traders and arbitrators. Most people here are not in that category.
Personally I don't really like it but if it can offload the chain the who am I to complain.
Lightning is much more interesting as it's a pure layer 2 system that only uses Bitcoin and doesn't require trust. And doesn't have some silliness subscription system or even a controlling entity.

The UK has been a bit of an odd duck in the union from the start and there's quite some time left before UK leaves, if ever.
The attacks were more than a year ago and the article talks about now. There's no crimewave now, there is crime for sure but nothing close to a wave. The only reason these things get so much press is that violent crime is less common in the EU.
And yes I am a europhile. My small country has nothing to put up against large actors like the multinational corporations and the superpowers. If we're not part of the EU we would have nothing defending our consumers.

The value in the nTimeLock field of the transaction indicates when the funds are unlocked. It can be set as either a block height or a timestamp. The field is large enough to set the unlock very far into the future. Something like 10 000 years.

Trezor doesn't have a hardware problem.
Trezor had a software problem that needed access to and modification of the hardware in order to be exploited.
Unless you can get a "hacked" firmware onto the trezor there's no way to read out the seeds and such from the memory as it's never written to that memory.
At least that's my interpretation. 
It seems to me that the blog post about the attack was somehow written for malicious intent. It contained just enough truth to be able to push a false agenda. For profit perhaps? The post is considerably vague regarding the exploit that Trezor hasn't acknowledged and patched.

If something is predictable there can be no bad traders. My entire point is that bitcoin isn't predictable. Because it isn't predictable there can be trading and speculation, there can be good traders and bad traders. 
Being predictable means that someone with enough math and computational power van calculate **exactly** what will happen. This is not possible with bitcoin or any other traded commodity.
Bitcoin is extremely unpredictable due to lack of regulation, it's comparatively small size and it's unconnectedness to any real commodity or state backed currency.

There are a few places on this earth that lacks governments. They are universally regarded as hell-holes of death, sickness, despair and starvation.
In your fantastical vision of the world how do the "unproductive" feed themselves? The infirm, the old, the young?
Humanity has been in more or less a state of starvation for around a million years. Long before there were any socialist philosophies people were starving. Long before there were organised states of any kind people were starving. Starvation has been the basic mechanic for population control and migration. People multiplied until there were no longer enough to eat then they either moved, starved or started killing each other for the remaining resources. 
Capitalism is rather good for a lot of things. Infrastructure, healthcare, education, mitigation for social issues, care for the old and the young are not among those things. 
**People do not act in their own self-interests.**

* secure is true as there is no way for any participant to steal your money. The worst that can happen is that they are locked out a specific time.
* better privacy is true as there are fewer peers who can see your transaction and most never even end up on the public chain. It's not perfect privacy though, but it is better.
* instant, fast - can be true, can also be false. Most transactions should be instant. Some could stick if p2p mesh has a rift or if one of the peers stop responding or acts in bad faith. Bad faith actors would be thrown out of the system quite quickly or routed around.
* inexpensive - This is debatable. It will always be less expensive than a blockchain transfer. It might even be really really dirt cheap. There is a hidden cost in every soft fork due to technical debt of keeping old protocols alive. It's possible but not likely that SegWit does some kind of damage to the ecosystem. I don't think so but it can't be completely ruled out. Although the segwit patch does fix some things that we know are damaging right now.

what are these institutional incentives that all states share?
States do compete with other states. Trade, war, science, culture and so on. Most modern states compete with prestige. For many states, mostly the nordics and a lot of europe there is massive prestige in having a well educated, healthy, happy population.
States can be incentivized in many ways but when the ruling power comes from the people the state needs to pander to the people. Sadly some of the larger states in the world have obfuscated their political system so that other interest are those that are pandered to.

Tomorrow you will have 10 btc and 10 bcc. They will be stored on the same address but on different chains. BCC has inbuilt double spend protection so sending coins from one address should not make it possible to use the same data to send from the other chain. 
Your new shiny BCC do represent a value. In a zero sum world the new BCC + the new BTC = the old BTC in dollar value. This isn't a zero sum system so it is likely that value will be created or destroyed. Many people would like to move out of BCC and if timed correctly might even get some more BTC out of it
Many BCCers have vowed to sell their BTC and buy BCC. I find that rather unlikely.

Or so many here think. Mostly Americans though. There are multiple states in the EU that have surrendered control of their currency to external actors. A state is a lot more than just money. 
The central banks do try to control inflation but they are almost always a separate entity from the state. 
A state is primarily taxes, the use of taxes, social systems and infrastructure. These functions can be performed regardless of what currency you use.
Bitcoin is no more of a threat to my state than oil, soy beans, or the US dollar.
Bitcoin is possibly a counter or check on large banks and some central bank functions. It might also help people who end up in political systems that wreck the economy. Bitcoin is not a threat to western states in any way shape or form.
If you see bitcoin as a way to avoid taxes then you're a morally corrupt individual or I sincerely hope you stop using tax paid things like medical care, roads, education and so on.

Eth/etc was of course different since it was the "owners"/devs that hard forked. Some people chose to remain on the legacy chain and it was rebranded as Ethereum Classic.

Everyone can run a website. It's quite trivial to set one up really. Of course you won't get facebook style reliability from your dinky dsl line at home but if you have a stable fiber connection your should easily be able to serve a basic wordpress or similar.


Yes it's likely that the larger hubs will be run by companies. I don't see what fiat has anything to do with this.


This is where you seem to be misunderstanding. LN is a way to send small transactions back and forth without bothering the blockchain. You set up one channel with say half a coin (paying a regular transaction fee) and then you can buy coffee and loot crates for the entire amount with pennies for fees. If you then sell your team fortress hats you can have the payment via your channel refilling it. At any point in time you can commit your channel to the blockchain and reclaim your funds.


LN nodes can vet people. Most won't. There's no incentive to know who is on the other side of the channel really. It's true that wallet providers likely will have LN network access. But then you have already given up your keys to a wallet provider after all. There is nothing in the LN spec forcing you to keep your money in an online wallet.


No. LNs are trustless. Paypal problems can't happen because a LN can not steal your money. Worst case is they lock the channel up for a few days. And after that no one will trust that node any more.


If you have a good connection and a few bitcoin to spare it would be a great way to get some extra money. Possibly. At least I'm going to give it a go once the networks begin to go live. But the LN network will probably not be user-run. It won't be completely decentralized but there's no reason to believe it will be run by just a few meganodes either.


As a LN user you don't want large nodes. Large nodes are likely to be saturated and thus have low liquidity. There will be a constantly changing fee market where nodes balance their fees depending on how many channels they can handle. Your client will choose a couple of cheap one that seems stable.

LN channel fees will not be $100.
LN channel setup is a background activity done with low fee transactions. For most of bitcoins existence 1sat/byte transactions have gone through eventually and that's all that is needed. There are further avenues of research to make this even cheaper by using channel factories.
You seem to be under the misconception that block size is a forbidden topic here. It is not. What will get you censored is when you try to push an agenda that's obviously against the consensus and that has been rehashed in absurdum.
For bitcoin to be a global currency with billions of daily users we will need several new features and optimizations, block size is one of these. Bitcoin won't reach these amounts of users by changing the values today, the only thing that would do is to harm the current system and load up on blockchain debt that every node will have to pay more or less forever.
The conversation isn't forbidden here, the agenda pushing is.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:51:26
Lightning isn't a company. A node isn't a company. There will probably be companies that run nodes but anyone can run one.
LNs are a trustless 3rd party in a transaction. It's not a payment processor company like visa.
There are multiple implementations of the LN protocol but they are in the process of harmonizing the LN base protocol so they will likely be more or less interoperable when released.
LNs have nothing to do with converting fiat. That's something that exchanges do.

As far as I understand drivechain needs miners to agree to an "out of bounds" softfork where they treat specific "anyone can spend" addresses as special cases. While that isn't a federation per-se it doesn't seem very likely to gain traction to me. It also relies on it taking months to get the money out which in case of some massive bug or abandonment event could get really really dicey.
But I have to admit that the material online is a bit over my head. At least after a quick skimming of the sites.

You don't use SEPA transactions to pay for your coffee, you don't bring your gold bars to buy beer, you don't bring your entire net worth in cash to buy a house.
Bitcoin can't be the coffee transaction system to the world. It was a mechanism used to get bitcoin off the ground but it doesn't scale like that. Bitcoin will be the technology that the secure system you use to buy your coffee with a phone app is based upon and secured by.

This absolutely has to do with blockchain technology. The proposed way to "fix" this is to manipulate the blockchain. 
This isn't bitcoin blockchain tech but it is blockchain tech. Bitcoins blockchain is probably and hopefully by now large enough and robust enough to not be susceptible to this kind of rollback.
But eth and the DAO are absolutely blockchain based technologies. The "failure" of the DAO here isn't a blockchain failure same as the failure of mtgox wasn't a blockchain failure either.

You do realize that bitcoin miner incentives is going down at a predictable rate, yes?
The fees per block if bitcoin becomes entirely fee based and is profitable will be stupid high. It is very likely that mining by then will be taken over by two distinct sets of hardware
1. Heat generating hardware. If you have something that turns electricity to heat it might as well mine some blocks as well. Not for full profit but it will offset your costs. 
2. Hardware run by stakeholders like exchanges, 2nd level operations, wallet providers and so on.
It is of course very much unclear when this transition will happen or even if bitcoin in its current form will exist that long but a purely fee driven mining community will make bitcoin to expensive to exist.
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:06:21
It depends on where in the world you are. I will personally sell off some coin soon as it's financially stupid to have such a large amount of your total net worth in a volatile currency. I have a family to support and even if I believe bitcoin will be a massive player in the future that doesn't matter now.
What I will do and what I have done before is to transfer coins to my fully vetted account on bitstamp, sell them for fiat and do a sepa transfer to my bank. Next year I will file and pay my taxes on my net gain.
Then I'll invest the fiat in some less unstable things like mutual funds or such.
If at any point in time my fiat holding grows larger and I still have confidence in the bitcoin system I will do the procedure in reverse.
In the US it might be a bit trickier as some banks don't like bitcoin but you can always try localbitcoins if you want a bit grayer transactions.

No we can't really blame anyone from following the hash rate. We can blame them for supporting what's essentially a power grab, we can blame them for supporting poorly tested software.
I suspect many people will follow the hash rate. But to openly support it before it has happened is treasonous right now. I see absolutely no advantage to removing control of the reference protocol from core. I'm afraid it will ruin the confidence people have in the system.
If you read the 2x devs publications you see it described as a one-shot upgrade to the bitcoin protocol but if you read the later comments they seem to be wanting to keep control of the protocol even after the split.

My pet theory is that many americans have been taught a "founding fathers" mindset. A lot of american politics seem to be based upon what these great men meant exactly instead of if what they wrote is still relevant. Being a deeply religious country kinda helps this mindset because even if an individual isn't very religious the "one true source" mentality is still in evidence everywhere.
My country doesn't really have a "founding father" nor an everlasting constitution. We aren't very religious and our work ethic prioritizes cooperation not hierarchy. 
I have great respect for Satoshi and his (hopefully) voluntary decision to step away. He will always be an important part of Bitcoin but as time goes by his technical heritage will diminish. And this is IMHO exactly what he wanted.

Well yes. Segwit moves some of the transaction data (the witnessing) into the segwit portion of the block and that part is discounted compared to the transaction block.

If bitcoin were predictable then traders would use the predictability to make a lot of money thus removing the predictability. 
You can't have day trading if your commodity is predictable. For every buy there has to be a sell. People try to predict and look for patterns, they do financial analysis voodoo but that doesn't mean they're correct. A currency at the size of bitcoin is mathematically a chaos system where the slightest change in minor variables can have massive influence.
There are predictable events like halvenings, expected political decisions and protocol upgrades but the effects of these events is psychological as well and that's unpredictable.

2FA or 2 factor authorization has nothing to do with phones. Many systems use separate dongles and physical card readers.
Some solutions uses phones and some of those have made the stupid choice of letting someone reclaim their account using only an SMS. This doesn't make 2fa bad and the entire point of 2fa is that you have 2 different mechanisms that have to work together. So just having your 2nd factor won't work unless they also have your password.
The problem of course being that some idiotic systems lets you reclaim your password via SMS as well.
There are many 2fa solutions that don't rely on your carrier. 1password has one, blizzard has one for their own use, google has one and so on. In my country we have a very well working solution where you store a cryptographic ID card on your phone that you can use to access all sorts of sites and government functions. These IDs can't be reclaimed via the mobile operator, you need to log into your internet bank to get one issued to your phone specifically.

You do realize what the phrase "cryptographic proof" means right?
I can prove that I own coins by signing a message with the key to an address that holds those coins. It's irrefutable.
There were some system that let you see if an exchange held your coin but not let you see others. That way you'd only need one account holder not finding his coin to prove the exchange was running a fractional reserve. It doesn't expose anything and it would ensure at least some level of proof.
I don't know if any exchange actually did this but there were some serious outcries when gox fell.

There are no real proof that just because bitcoin has behaved in one way it will continue to behave this way. It's unpredictable by nature. 
That's why the prudent thing to do is to follow sound investment advice and be a bit cautious.

In practical terms how long would you have to detect the bad actor?

Wouldn't these factors combine to make the LN reasonably safe? I hope the intermediate nodes will have some kind of trust value or uptime or similar.

Bitmain is not trustworthy, I agree. There are many valid complaints against bitmain. Covert asicboost is not one of them since there's no tangible proof that it has ever been used. There are no known mining hardware that's capable of doing it, there's no known software or firmware that's capable and there's no real evidence in the blockchain that can't also be spv mining (mining incomplete blocks since the last block isn't validated yet).
I just grow really tired of people spouting covert asicboost nonsense around here all the time without taking a second to research it. If we ever find any evidence of covert asicboost I'll be right next to you all screaming about it but until then don't use it as an argument because it's shaky at best.

A two way peg means that you can move funds  from one chain to another securely. It means that one L-BTC and one BTC will always be the same.
The problem is that trustless two way pegs aren't possible with the current protocol. Moving funds from BTC to a sidechain (IE locking it on the blockchain and creating a token on the side chain) can be done completely trustless like a normal transaction but moving funds back (destroying token on sidechain and unlocking the BTC) can't be. Bitcoin doesn't have the ability to understand the "X coins have been destroyed so unlock x coins on the blockchain" operation. Instead sidechains uses a federated n out of m key system to release funds. This is fundamentally a trustfull operation and as such it can't ever be as secure as regular bitcoin.

Right now mining bth is a loss compared to mining btc. If bth would have followed the bitcoin docs the difficulty would take around 2000 blocks to adjust. That would have killed the currency so instead they have a system where difficulty lowers faster over time. So the political supporters of bth are mining it slow enough that the difficulty keeps sinking but fast enough that transactions actually go through sometimes.
Theoretically the difficulty should balance out where mining is equally profitable on both chains.
I predict that at that difficulty bch will be the target of a lot of attacks due to the very low difficulty.
The entire point of the blockchain is that the difficulty and network size would make attacks and spoofs impossible. BCH advocates don't seem to care about that.

There is no real difference between you and the humans that lived for 100 of thousands of years ago. And still our capabilities are vastly different. Our language is more complex our understanding of the world is vastly superior. I can easily take a few friends and go to a modestly equipped garage and build a machine that flies. In this span of time there has been no evolution. Evolution is a very very slow process that let's organisms, or rather the offspring of organisms, adapt to changing environments. And the most important thing is that it's completely random. Sometimes a change is useful almost always it's not.
Intelligence on the other hand let's you adapt now. If you're cold you can get some clothes instead of hoping that in a few million years your distant descendants have more fur. Intelligence is on a completely different time scale than evolution.
Our society is not because of our evolved brains, it's because we figured out how to teach our young, we figured out how to read and write, we figures out maths. Our society doesn't exist because of evolution, our society exists despite evolution.
Evolution is an imperfect process, it's a sloppy process, it results in things that work good enough. There are species of anemones that live their entire lives stuck to a rock. They eat passing by particulates and they release their eggs in the hope that some other anemone along the line fertilizes them. They don't have any waste disposal system so eventually they fill up with shit and die. That's perfectly OK with evolution as long as they manage to procreate nothing else matters.
Intelligence is the opposite of evolution. Intelligence is the purposeful pursuit of a goal. Evolution is the random bumbling for procreation. Humans don't exist due to evolution we exist because of pure dumb luck.
Evolution has not been going on since the big bang. It's been going on since the first life appeared on earth which is billions of years later. Evolution might be a common thing in the universe, it might also just be a fluke. But once evolution gives way to intelligence it's role is more or less over. We have goals and plans. Evolution don't.

A soft fork is when something that was previously allowed is now disallowed. It's a tightening of the rules. It's backwards compatible since old clients can still understand whats going on. 
A reduction in the amount of btc you are allowed to collect when finding a block is a soft fork since your wallet won't care.
A hard fork is when something that was previously forbidden is suddenly allowed.
Increasing the block size is a hard fork since your wallet software wouldn't understand the larger blocks and would mark them invalid and as such you would leave the network.
These are the real definitions of hard and soft forks. The reason why the core devs are against say just upping the blocksize is that this risks old clients and non-upgraded business software forking off the network. Soft forks and hard forks have nothing to do with controversy or weather the fork is consensual.
Now interestingly forks can be different for different actors in the system. The segwit upgrade was a soft fork for any wallet software, it can still see the network and it's transactions would work just fine. It is not a soft fork for miners since if they don't understand the new format it will likely cause issues, that's why the signaling percentage needed to be so high before segwit was activated since we needed to make sure that a very large part of the miners would follow.

If you really want to discuss these things then try to focus on the philosophy or the perceived advantage of changing bitcoin not the actual implementation. I can argue blocksize without pushing BCH. I can argue smarter blockchains without promoting ETH.

Network proves themselves by working under strain. Handling a couple of large blocks is no issue. It's when the network reaches a size comparative of bitcoin with the large amount of miners, services, full nodes and users that the effects of multiple large blocks starts to become evident.
Block size isn't really the issue, block latency is. If blocks aren't propagated around the network fast enough the amounts of orphans that will be created will go up. These will cause several minor network splits that will make transactions less secure since you will often have to wait several blocks to be sure.

Anyone with a calculator can realize that on-chain scaling isn't going to work. It just isn't ever going to work. The amount of transactions grows faster than the capacity to handle them.

There are many things good with segwit but it does add complexity and it does add things to the chain in an ad hoc way. And the way things are going it's going to be harder and harder to clean up the protocol as time goes by. Every weird solution we implement now is  likely going to be a technical debt people might be paying hundreds of years down the line.

Asicboost is a way to massage the block a miner is currently mining in order to make it easier to mine. 
The overt version in this firmware uses a part of the block that can be changed easily without producing an invalid block to do so. This does mean that one part of the block that's usually used for signaling versions and support will become filled with garbage data.
By creating a block with specific properties the mining of that block can theoretically become 20-30% easier.
It basically has to do with the way that the hashing algorithm consumes data in specific amounts.

bitcoin can't work as a global mass payment system now and it's still useful. If you do a transaction right before a spike hits you can wait for hours for your transfer to clear even though you used best practices for fee calculations.

Bitcoin needs miners when the protocol is designed around self-interest mining being beneficial to all.

In that case bitcoin seized to exist several years ago after the first hard fork. What is a *valid* block is decided by the consensus. 
Bitcoin is the longest blockchain with the most hashrate that's supported by the most used protocol implementation that currently has the largest working consensus.

Bitcoin is an attack at banking in general an central banking in particular. It isn't against states, taxes nor companies (with or without financial analysts).

I personally think that non-equity based bailouts are wrong. They are a form of theft where you transfer private debt onto the people.
The only form of bailout I can personally accept is when the state buys the company stock outright or gets a payback with interest in a reasonable time frame.

some people think the risk is worth the reward. If you want to day-trade you need to be on an exchange. 
But bitcoin correctly used can be a very special type of commodity that can't in any way be stolen from you. It's entirely possible to store the key to a bitcoin wallet in your own head. It isn't recommended but it can be done.
Having bitcoin on an exchange means that you don't actually have any coin. You have the promise of coin and you have to trust the exchange to deliver on that promise. Exchanges have gone down, exchanges have been hacked, exchanges have been outright scams. Unless you are actively trading your coin then keep them where you control them exclusively.
Few coins: keep them on a phone wallet reasonably secured
More coin: get a hardware wallet, be extremely careful with your backup.
Lots of coin: Absolutely get a hardware wallet now, in fact get several and use one for spending and one for cold storage. Figure out a way to split your backup into several pieces and get yourself a lawyer.

But while bitfinex were supposed to publish proof and some other exchanges have been professionally audited there doesn't seem to be any exchange that really have foolproof crypto proofing published.

See figure 2. 
Bumping the blocksize too 2MB + segwit will exclude a massive amount of nodes. I believe that bitcoin decentralization (of the base layer) is the most important thing with bitcoin. If it isn't decentralized it will fall once the powers that be begins the attacks in earnest. Price, mempool, blocksize or whatever does not matter if we lose decentralization. The core devs are deeply aware of this, that's why they're being so very very careful regarding block size. 
Pushing arbitrary block size increases now is good for the bitcoin economy but possibly devastating to bitcoins future. I absolutely support growing the blocksize at some point, but doing it just a couple of months after segwit is stupid.
Now regarding control of the protocol. The nation's where the workers rose up and seized control over the legislation didn't do that well. The USSR and friends weren't exactly shining beacons of productivity and resource allocation. The countries with the best worker conditions are the one were the unions and the owners have similar amount of power. The segwit2x is a hostile takeover that has the potential to ruin all trust in the bitcoin system.
Why would miners agree to the next halvening when they control the software?
The effects of 2x are not obvious on chain bugs, it's a systematic damage to the entire network.  It might be needed but I doubt it's needed 3 month after segwit.
I want a balance of power, core controls the protocol, miners control the transactions. There's no need for name-calling.

It could also be worth zero dollars. The key here is that your personal wealth should always be spread out proportionally between high risk and low risk and liquid capital. If your high risk part, bitcoin for instance, gets to large you should move a portion to more low risk investments.
You should not sell all your coin and perhaps if you really believe in it you could keep a slightly higher portion of coins in your investment scheme. But you need to mentally set a balance and strive to keep it.
If you really believe in bitcoin you can keep buying in small amounts every month just like you should with all your other investments.

You can smoke tobacco all day every day and still die of old age and you can probably get some kind of psychosis after one serious bong hit. But yeah as you said. Smoking tobacco is a lot worse but that might also have things to do with frequency of use and such as well. Heavy smokers gets through multiple packs a day. That amount would likely be impossible for smoked cannabis.

The exchanges will, as will every other node, reject the first too large block. 
Then they will reject the block built upon that block.
Then a miner will build a valid block that replaces the too large block; nodes, exchanges and services will accept this block.

* There are no LN-coins, it's all bitcoin
* The LN network is a transaction layer, not a coin storage layer.
You can't receive or send transactions over LN unless both parties are online. Buy why would you need to? If you don't need instant transactions between online parties then LN just isn't the correct system to use. It's like wondering why your boss can't use his company credit card to pay your salary.
If you want offline transactions then just use the blockchain. LNs use-case is primarily buying micro-services online. So both parties being online is kind of implied.
It's possible that LN will be extended to cover these use-cases in the future or it's possible that other 2nd layer services will be able to handle that but currently offline LN transactions doesn't make sense.

No a blockchain is decentralized and ruled by consensus. That's the whole point and it's a point I made in my post. There are several interorganisational uses for blockchain. Like chain of custody for properties and origin/handling tracking for consumables.

It is confusing yes. But so is tcp/ip and the entire OSI stack that all modern networking works on. But still it's trivial for you to post here on reddit.
The point of course is to work these things out so that they are seamless, easy and quick. Right now it's text commands ands test nets and such but once the base is working adding a gui isn't that hard.
I would imagine most wallets would just give you two accounts. Bitcoin Wallet and Lightning wallet. You place some funds in the lightning wallet and it would set up a channel to either a known or a random hub. Then payments would happen with just a few clicks or a qr code or similar. Once your channel is depleted you would get a message to start a new one.
It's also possible that there will be some limited lightning networks like casinos or online games that don't speak to the rest of the network. These would be handled separately.

Worst case is that your closure transaction doesn't go through in time and that the node manages to take your funds. A channel is a time locked transaction that defaults to fully transferred at it's end. You and the hub both set up a transaction to each other with the same amount. If the hub messes with your transaction you can mess with theirs basically.

In what freaking way does a closed, invite only meeting in NY between a couple of industry interests come close to "agreed with in the community"?
I haven't agreed to surrender control over the protocol to those in charge of enforcing it. It's downright stupid actually. It's like letting the police make the laws or like letting Wall street run the SEC.
You need to be extremely aware of this, even if you disagree with core: 
**Miners interests do not align with your interest** 
The protocol is set up so that the selfish thing to do by a miner is actually good for the network. But it isn't perfect from a mining perspective. Once the miners own the implementation, Bitcoin will likely become a lot better for miners and large stake holders. It will very likely not be better for you.
Bitcoin is a tripod. We have devs, users and miners. A working cryptocurrency needs a balance between these. Letting one leg become too large or too small will wreck the currency.

Everyone can memorize 24 words in exact order. It's a skill that can be taught. Such memory training used to be more or less mandatory before computers, cell phones and the internet was a thing. People today compete in remembering hundreds of digits of pi. It's not impossible nor especially hard if you just learn the techniques and practice a bit.
Now technically a brain wallet can have any numbers of bits, words or characters. I used 24 words since it's a common method to backup seed keys that is generally viewed as being uncrackable if properly randomized. The human brain is better at remembering words than random alphanumeric strings. There are also some BIPs that discuss seed mnemonics that doesn't need the words to be in any particular order wich would make fitting them together to remember them a lot easier.

No because it's opt-in with 2x as the default. It's the complete opposite of solved.
You don't introduce new features that force all others to upgrade to not lose money. You introduce new features that old clients don't see until upgraded.
BCH did this correctly where all BCH clients, nodes and miners look for the BCH bit before listening. 2X does it ass backwards where every other client, node and miner have to do the check.
The danger is old clients. You can't solve old clients by pushing an update because the old clients aren't updating.

2 years ago was when the devs were trying to push segwit through in order to alleviate the pressure and encourage level 2 solutions. The roadmap signed by the core devs clearly state that once segwit was through it would open up the software to a lot of possible improvements in throughput. The roadmap even talks about block size increases in a carefully planned non-contentious way once needed.
The miners deliberately ruined these plans by playing power games. I see no reason to believe that they would have let core do a seriously dangerous hard fork either. 
So the answer to your question about why we couldn't raise the blocksize two years ago is that miners and some other players decided to wrest political control of bitcoin from core and did so with the one method under their control, blocking voting on new features.

Climate change is only a political issue in the US. The rest of the world is well aware but realizes that unless we change within the economic system it would mean catastrophy anyway.
The stigma against illegal drugs in my country stems mostly from the illegality of the substances not some scientific ignorance. Personally I'd like most drugs to be legal. It would remove large swathes of the organized crime syndicates and people with addiction issues could get some real help.
My country seems stuck in some kind of invasive morality drive where it's the states purpose to guide us "right". I look forward to the great cannabis experiment that parts of the US is about to become. Because if there are any glaring mental or physical health issues they're sure to pop up well before the stuff is legal here.
It would undoubtedly help bitcoin at large if it were disassociated with drugs as regardless of what you think drugs are illegal and people go to jail for doing them.

Your entire scenario is unviable since someone who is at an actual risk of having a gun against his head for his coin and is a somewhat reasonable individual wouldn't have told anyone his actual net worth.
If you're paranoid enough to actually keep your coin in a brainwallet then that would likely be the case.

Should I be able to buy and sell stuff small scale without telling the IRS? I think so. But I don't need large bills for that. Should large scale tax evasion be OK? I don't think so. You probably would need large bills for that (or be a multinational corporation ofc)

It's certain that countries that have embargoes on them are dabbling in cryptocurrency without a doubt. Even if cryptocurrency isn't widespread it's still a functional way to transfer money without going through swift and similar systems.
The best way to get "clean" bitcoin/cryptocurrency  is to mine it. So that is very likely happening.
If you want a lot of btc at once there are some people and organizations that do OTC trading. This is done off-exchanges as no one wants to move the price that much. I suspect some of the more desperate countries just have "agents" that buy coin on exchanges.

I don't doubt that he has a couple of million dollars in coin hidden away but he doesn't have a million bitcoin and he has absolutely stolen, swindled and squandered a lot of money.
The thing is: You don't have to go court to prove that you own coin, you don't need advanced legal entities and trusts to handle your coin. Bitcoin doesn't need a legal framework to function. Bitcoin is math, if you have the keys you have the coin. If you have the keys you can irrefutably prove that you have the coin. If you are Satoshi you can prove it by signing messages with some early addresses.
You don't use legal frameworks to prove anything about bitcoin, you use math. Satoshi knew this, Craig does not. Satoshi didn't set up trusts, companies or other organizations. Satoshi didn't try to copyright shit.

3. Really cold wallets. You keep the largest parts of your stash on a system that requires multiple (but redundant) parts to open. It doesn't matter if they have you because they need a hardware wallet that's at the bank, lawyers, lockbox buried at your parents. Or some kind of N of M type deal.

This is quite simple. If bitcoin followed ANY kind of predictable pattern a lot of mathmagicians would use this to make a lot of money thus directly pushing it to become non-predictable. 
There is no scenario where bitcoin follows predictable patterns. The curves we have are fractal in nature. You can always match the current pattern with a previous pattern and it just won't mean anything.

It's all a gamble, my friend. The point is that you need to balance the gamble.
Bitcoin is ridiculously volitile and having large percentages of your net worth in something like that doesn't make a lot of sense. Does this mean that I might not go to the moon with everyone else? Perhaps, but at least I won't be getting ulcers when the price bottoms out.
I'm never going to sell all my coin and I very much look forward to the day when bitcoin stops being an investment and starts being a currency but in 10 years I'm aiming to be financially independent and perhaps retired. By then having a steady income from my portfolio is worth a lot more than riding the crazy train. That might mean that I lose out on a lot of gains but at some point you have to look for an amount that you can comfortably live on for the rest of your life. Everything more than that is just excessive, it won't really increase your quality of life.

He had a business partner, they did some mining and stuff. The partner dies and Craig steals the partners share.
This much is true. 
Now since Craig claims that he is Satoshi the estate of the dead partner claims half of what Satoshi could have mined. So if Craig is satoshi he owes half of satoshis coin but if he isn't, which he actually really really isn't, then he owes half of what he actually did mine. And I'm pretty sure Craig already lost or squandered most of that money.
The absolute deliciousness here is that if Craig stops claiming to be satoshi then he's off the hook for satoshis money but he's then liable for perjury suits.

You don't open a channel to another person just like you don't use your modem to connect to another person's modem anymore. 
You open a channel to one of the LN hubs and that hub is connected to other hubs and one of those is connected to the entity you want to pay. This way you can pay anyone on the LN network any number of times instantly with low fees. 
The drawbacks is that you have to "lock up" the funds the channel needs, the receiving partner needs to be online (I think) and you need to keep a periodic check on the blockchain so that someone isn't trying to cash out your channel without your approval.
LNs are slightly less secure but they are instant, cheap and secure enough for daily purchases and such. Once hubs are established it will be worth a lot more to be trustworthy than to try an meddling with someone's coffee purchase. And there is no way for a hub to hide if it's trying something dishonest.

If anyone was seriously developing 2x then wouldn't there be a lot of commits and discussions? I mean it isn't so far off that they plan to perform a massive hard fork involving one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies. 
If we are to go 2x then I'd very very much like to see daily commits, tests and discussions. Bitcoin is supposed to be open source and transparent. Isn't the entire 2x supposed to be strike for decentralization?

Incorrect. Even bitcoin transaction fees are expected to be less than the cost of mining eventually. Mining would be performed by entites that have a stake in the networks continued existence not for direct profit.
In a currency exclusion is an issue. In a blockchain dealing with traceability of products and services it's not an issue. If you plan on using blockchain tech to build another currency you will fail but the point is that blockchains can be used for a lot of other things where the ability to exclude participants is a useful feature.
Yes the blockchain is a revolution due to its "no trust" capabilities. If you want your own chain to operate in a "No trust" way then your best bet is to lock it to the current chain with colored coins or similar things.
But it is still useful and actually will soon be in use as "low trust" system. I believe that some large store chain in the US is experimenting with having its suppliers register all batch data for products on a shared blockchain. That way every participant in a product chain can be identified and tracked without any single entity controlling the entire blockchain. Now the managers of the chain or the trusted participants have to generate keys and give to new suppliers and also have the ability to invalidate previous keys but they can't change the actual content of the chain.
It's an excellent use of blockchain tech that isn't a currency, isn't public and doesn't require "no trust".

Well not really. If the system itself is useful for all mining participants then rewards is not a necessary incentive. Kinda like when bitcoin mining stops giving meaningful rewards sometime in the future.
These blockchain tech implementations are not really publicly facing. They don't want random miners. They only want a power balance where none of the involved actors can fool the others aline.
You can tailor the mining protocol in many different interesting ways. Bitcoin is built upon not having to trust anyone but there are many implementations where you can have different values of trust.

Getting randomness is a very important problem in computer science. Almost every single cryptographic system relies on having true (or at least non repeatable) randomness. Getting seemingly random numbers is easy, thee are several algorithms that spit out a number every time you run them that are very close to random. But the problem with these algorithms is that for a given start state they always produce the same sequence. To combat this you seed the random generator with one true random value and then you can generate a bunch more random numbers from that, or at least random enough to not be predictable by an attacker.
So from a small amount of true random we can create a lot of secure pseudo-random. Getting the true random is done via something called an entropy pool. A computer will constantly collect small pieces of randomness from as many sources as it can, it will read uninitialized memory, it will listen for static on analog inputs, it can pick out some bits from the network or similar sources.
So as long as an attacker can't predict your starting randomness they have no way of predicting the keys you generate. 
You use entropy pool randomness to generate your seeds, you use your seed to generate the master key and you use the master key to generate your actual bitcoin adresses. All of these processes are completely deterministic in one way but seemingly random in the other direction. Even if an attacker were to compromise one adress, he still can't deduce the other adresses nor the master key.

Yes but why would that be indicative of it working again? If the modern currencies collapse we wouldn't go "back" to anything. We would go forward to something new (and probably horrible).
It is very obvious that the lack of liquid capital during the "use valuable metals as money" phase was a massive problem. Resources were not allocated well and rare metals pooled in certain places causing other countries massive issues.
I fail to see any indication that we as a species would willingly go back to a system that didn't work. Even if the entire world collapse there will still be enough economists and scientists left in charge after the dust clears to bootstrap a basic fiat currency.

LVT - Land value tax. You tax owners of land for the value of that land. A plot on manhattan will be extremely expensive, a part of montana won't. As long as a state has a police force or a military this tax can be collected regardless of currency.
VAT - Value added tax. You tax sales. Companies will always have to be registered, they will always be audited. Without a functional state you can't have a company since a company is a type of legal framework and laws are kept by states. Currency is irrelevant.

Because gambling laws are extremely tricky and violations (like letting children gamble) are very severe. You could easily end up going to jail. 
If you let your customers buy game bucks that they can only use in your game you are kind of safe. The game bucks aren't real money so people are just gambling and playing for meaningless tokens. But if it's possible to move money out? If money can be transferred or gambled between players? Especially if these transactions are semi obfuscated like many cryptocurrencies are?

The mempool isn't one singular thing, every miner and node has its own mempool. Some poolkeepers periodically removes transactions that it feels are spam or to low fee to be worth bothering with. 
But as long as there is some miner that still has your transaction in their pool it might get into a block eventually so it's actually impossible to know if it has disappeared or not.
If you really want your transaction to go through there are several ways to do so. 
There are replace by fee RBF and child pays for parent systems in place. Some mining pools also offer web "accelerators" where they reserve some space in their blocks for random people who have made mistakes.

They kinda do. Most sidechains rely on moving money to the sidechains. This is most often done by "freezing" assets on one chain and instancing it on another. Now the sidechain needs to know that you haven't unfrozen the funds as that would be a double spend. If you have malleabillity the sidechain has to watch every single transaction closely while with the fix it only needs to look for a specific txid.
Segwit is mainly a malleabillity fix.
Sidechains don't **need** segwit but they benefit greatly. Implementation of sidechains are simpler and new features that sidechains may want are easier to add with segwits new versioning.
The main reason for the lack of development in this are is that most devs were waiting for segwit.

"filling up" a LN wallet shouldn't take longer than any other on-chain transaction. With proper fees it should be less than 10 minutes although block times are never exactly predictable.
There will be systems that can "fill" your wallet quicker like atomic cross chain transfers or directly from exchanges to LN and so on. As long as your LN wallet has enough capacity you can fill it instantly from any other LN wallet. Now getting your LN wallet up to a reasonable capacity will always take time but this will be similar to setting up a bank account so it's a one-time inconvenience.

No one is claiming that white people can't be just as bad off as anyone else. It's also impossible to claim that white people doesn't have systematic privileges compared to other ethnicities. I personally abhor affirmative action and similar programs since they are technically institutional racism. But in the real world there are several systems that are so entrenched in their privileges that affirmative action is the lesser evil. It's very likely that the diversification drive has gone way to far, it's absolutely so that the "offensive silencing"/safe space bullshit has. 
I'm not saying that white people can't be the victims of racism, I'm not saying that men can't be the victims of sexism but It's just not the case in most systems in the western world. It happens but it isn't the same. There are degrees.
For every white male victim there are literally thousands of female and or black victims. So sadly at this point in time we as white men (actually I have no idea about your social, ethnical or gender based grouping) will have to suck it the fuck up for a few years.
So no, I'm not racist towards rich white men, mainly because it's my demographic and I have every right to call out my own tribes bullshit. If you feel defensive here it truly is the time to check your fucking privileges.
Also I'm not sorry in the least if I offended you. It's good to offend and be offended once in a while.

Overt and covert asicboost are extremely different techs. They don't work the same. No one is questioning that overt exists in Bitmains chips. But it has never been used.
Covert asicboost is an entirely different beast. Perfectly done it isn't detectable but, and it's a big but, the hardware needed is different. You need a lot of memory in every miner to shuffle transactions around. Such hardware has never been spotted in the wild. 
Are you seriously claiming that Bitmain not only has super special miners that no one has ever seen but can somehow make these so cheap that it offsets the 30% potential gain and the fact that they can't resell them and still make a profit?
Because I really don't think they do.
There's zero evidence of miners using covert asicboost since the hardware to do it doesn't exist.

No you are absolutely wrong. Bitcoin is not a collective, it is not run by mutual respect or any sense of community. Bitcoin is pure codified rational self-interest, it's mathematical egoism. The system is made, from the ground up, to make sure that any action that is rewarding to the individual is also good/useful for the system. Mining is a race, the fee market is a competition. Every aggressive action is countered by rules that everyone profits from following.
Bitcoin doesn't work because of the masses it works despite the masses. 
Mob rule is anathema to rational self-interest. If bitcoin needs politics or community to live on it deserves to die.
You are wrong.

This is absolutely a valid path. I will personally be trying to set up such a system as soon as LNs go live. The issue is of course that it requires your keys to be on the computer running the LN hub which will open you up to potential hacking.

SPV users don't, they ask nodes for transactions with bloom filters and the nodes give it to them.
A bitcoin node will return the transactions from bitcoin and a s2x node will return the transactions from the s2x chain.
If bitcoin has the most POW the s2x nodes will follow that. They will try to build big block on top of the latest block and they will then be slowly ostracized from the network losing the miner a lot of money.
If bitcoin has the most POW there will never really be a split just a an orphan or two along the way.

You keep some small decoy funds in the trezor 24 word wallet with a watcher on your phone. If the funds move your seed is stolen.

You are revisioning history here.
Bitcoin is an economic system, it has a value based on usefulness. There are several other systems in competition. If bitcoin fails another will take it's place. The invention that is cryptocurrency is not tied to the prime mover bitcoin. The invention, the philosophy, can live on without bitcoin. 
If bitcoin fails due to attacks it isn't resilient enough to become a global system and therefore it's better that it dies. Evolutionary principles works at the market scale as well. 
I don't have "faith" with my money, it isn't a belief system. I don't owe anything to bitcoin and bitcoin doesn't owe anything to me. Bitcoins basic ruleset is based on every actor acting in their own self-interest. If those that want to harm bitcoin are successful then bitcoin is a failed system that has to be kept alive with faith and trust.

The posted links mainly deal with street prostitution. There's no real argument that those individuals are likely the victims of childhood abuse, drugs, poverty and many other social factors. But your claims are that all prostitution in all social classes and every country is mainly the product of childhood abuse and the number aren't there.
If prostitution is illegal and seen as a social stigma then of course it will be the poor and abused that are forced to do it. But that doesn't mean that the two things are directly related.
In Denmark there are state employed prostitutes that provide services to the handicapped. There are prostitutes that cater to the rich and wealthy. There are suburban escorts that do it as a side business. There's the whole cam-industry.
I don't believe that you can categorically say that all prostitutes have had a bad childhood. It just reeks of moral superiority complex.

That's why you have connections to multiple "hubs". And why your software will constantly balance channels, on chain when fees are low and off chain whenever a channel is close to tapped out. Running a LN "hub" isn't bandwidth or CPU intensive. There will be some centralization but not visa/matercard/PayPal style. We're talking hundreds or thousands of hubs not tens. Running a hub needs no more a company than mining needs a company. All you need is a stable connection and some coin.

I don't troll, it's you that are making up definitions out of thin air.
All hard forks are relaxing, it's what hard fork means in it's most basic form. You change the rule-set to that something you weren't allowed to do is now possible. This means that old clients won't understand whats happens and thus you have a hard fork, a break in the chain that requires new code to run.
If you don't relax the rules old clients can still follow. Rules aren't just code, they can be access-based and temporal as well.
If an unmodified old client can follow your new chain it's a soft fork, if it can't it's a hard fork. This only applies to clients. You can force miners and nodes to upgrade without it being a hard fork.

Well my main point is that a shitty childhood is closely tied with later criminality, drug abuse and other such activities.
My argument is that prostitution and perhaps drug use don't have to be criminal or "immoral" activities. The western world has a lot of hangups regarding sexuality which causes these activities to gravitate towards the bottom of society.
The only way to prevent this is to destigmatize it. And claiming that all prostitution is supporting child abuse is the absolute worst argument to use.
It's the same arguments the right uses on immigrants. They pick some crime statistics and say "look X% of violent crime is committed by immigrants, they must be thrown out", when in reality it's more like X+Y% of violent crime is committed by poor and uneducated persons and sadly immigrants mostly find themselves in that bracket.

There are very few who own coins and I will never again push anyone into bitcoin since a friend of mine lost money in the gox crash due to me not warning him. But a couple of friends have asked me how to set up wallets and buy coin lately and I have, after a stern warning, helped them out.

With the new versioning system in segwit we no longer need miner activated soft forks. The code can just be released and those miners that are aware of the new features can mine them.
At least that's my understanding.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:44:18
Except when they do. If clients see certain bits at certain times they will change their behavior. With the new segwit version strings this will become even more important as lesser script changes can be added quickly (relatively speaking of course).
I just have a pet peeve about the phrase "signalling for the NYA" when it doesn't actually mean anything. There's no real consensus about what NYA means even between the parties inside the NYA. Some miners thought core was in on it, others just wanted the segwit system, some have obviously thrown their support behind other ecosystems and some are just pushing radical agendas. A proper signal is BIP -&gt; discussion -&gt; coding -&gt; thorough testing -&gt;  release -&gt; signalling -&gt; implementation. And that isn't the NYA.

Changes to the system are done via consensus. If enough of the ecosystem feels the changes are beneficial to them the system will change. A sense of community has nothing to do with it. 
Bitcoin doesn't require communication other than miners setting version bits. A community on the other hand is communication.
It takes a community of developers to extend and improve bitcoin. But the goal is always that bitcoin should be an independent decentralization system that is resistant to change and manipulation.
There can be both benefits and disadvantages of community. But bitcoin doesn't need a community. If reddit were to shutdown tomorrow bitcoin would still be fine.

Centralization isn't just a word, it has a purpose. The purpose of bitcoin decentralization is for it to be resistant to attack.
LN is based on the blockchain. As long as the blockchain remains decentralized LN can be as centralized as it needs to be since the blockchain is the securing factor. You see LNs are trustless, you don't have to trust the centralized hubs. They can't steal your money, you are in control as long as the blockchain is decentralized and open.

If you read your own source you clearly see that the method described is the one we now call overt asicboost. The covert asicboost attack is not described nor implemented in Bitmain hardware.
An asic is a very single minded piece of hardware. It only does certain specific things. Reordering transactions to fit specific hashes is not one of those.
Overt asicboost is mostly about gaming the version string. And that's what is discussed, that's what's on the Bitmain silicon, that's what's been seen on the test net and that's what has never ever been observed in the wild on the main net.
Asicboost is a boogeyman, it's a fairytale used by idiots to muddy the water in an already infected situation.
If it can't be noticed, can't be traced and no one can find any hardware that does it then it has no functional place in the discussion either.

Racism is oppression. Discussions about difference between people isn't. I feel society should endeavor to treat every citizen equal, that doesn't mean that everyone is equal.

Sure. And fixing the IPv4 crisis is as simple as adding a few bits to the address field. Imagine right now there are only 3,706,452,992 public IP addresses. If we just add a single bit we would get twice that, instantly. Why don't we just do that, now?
Maybe because the entire fucking internet relies on those addresses?
It's the exact same thing with 1mb blocks. It is not a "simple change". The code is easy. The implementation and changing the entire ecosystem is vastly more complex. Every single piece of bitcoin tech would more or less have to be changed, at once.
It's not impossible but to do it correct would take a massive amount of planning and testing.

There is no possible way to stop someone from rolling their own. The only real counter is the market wising up to the bullshit and like an immune system stop interacting with them.

If the actions are aimed at "punishing" someone for either their privilege (perceived or actual) they are categorically wrong. I am not responsible for my forefathers. 
If the actions are aimed at breaking down current structures then they *can* be justified as long as everyone understand that the actions are not "good" but perhaps necessary.
A better approach is of course to try to help the disfavored group to reach the point where they can compete on their own merits.
But it is a tricky thing and in a better world it wouldn't be needed. But the US is far from perfect in this regard. Gerrymandering, voter ID laws and limits on other government services seems more or less designed to keep certain groups down. Is it fair for some privileged people to lose some disproportionate amount of privilege in order to break these structures? For the society at large. Yes it is, sadly.

There's still no proof that asicboost has ever been used on the mainnet. 
Overt asicboost has only ever been detected once on the testnet and there isn't a scrap of evidence that there exists any mining hardware capable of covert asicboost due to the large memory requirements. Miners sell their old hardware as part of their income calculations. The supposedly 30% increase in earnings would evaporate if they couldn't sell the hardware down the line. 
Some will claim that empty blocks are covert asicboost but wouldn't there be a lot more empty blocks?
IMHO empty blocks are often malconfigured mining hardware or a result of a miner getting lucky before he has had time to assemble the next block since miners run "on empty" just after a new block is released or received.
I would welcome anyone to show me a scrap of evidence about asicboost since this constant tinfoilhattery makes this sub look moronic. There is absolutely the ability for some miners to do overt asicboost and it is a scandal that these things were on chip without disclosure. But it hasn't ever been used.

It used to be forbidden to use any other pow than the one bitcoin uses now, after a hard fork there is another one that is allowed, ie something that was forbidden is now allowed.
At its most basic there are only two types of forks, soft forks that old clients understand and hard forks that old clients don't understand.
All your examples of "different" are things that are forbidden now, but are allowed after the fork. The fact that things that are allowed now will be forbidden after the fork doesn't matter since a hard fork supersede a soft fork.
An added limitation is a soft fork, an added relaxation is a hard fork. A change is a combination of limiting and relaxing but since relaxing is always a hard fork it is a hard fork.
There are not 3 types of forks, there are two.

Miners secure bitcoin. Nodes propagates and validate transactions and blocks. The new segwit2x fork has had a very low nodecount for quite some time meaning that when the split occurs the 2x network could become isolated and very poorly interconnected with a lot of spammy crosstalk between the two new chains until nodes have managed to ban the new nodes for violating the protocol.
Node count is also used as an unofficial way to show community buy-in for various splits. It isn't completely free to run an open node so those who do have some miniscule skin in the game so to speak. It's also perhaps useful to have your own node in splitting times since you can point your mobile wallet and such at your node and know that you see the chain you want to follow.
Lately a lot of nodes supporting segwit2x have popped up in a decidedly inorganic way. Further analysis by OP shows that these nodes are likely "sock-puppet" nodes spawned on amazon cloud in order to astroturf support for s2x and to perhaps help their tattered network post-fork.
If someone were to use the node count of s2x now as an indicator of community buy-in you know they are full of shit.

Since Sweden is one of the least cash using countries there's already well working cashless systems. Bitcoin has a hard time competing with that.

Mathematically a node is a point in a connected graph.
In early bitcoin a node was one instance of the bitcoin software that had the entire blockchain, a wallet and did mining. As mining got too heavy for normal computers the definition changed. 
Now a node is any bitcoin software that's connected to the network. A full node is a node that has a local copy of the entire blockchain and an open node is a full node that accepts external connections.
Nodes relay transactions and validates new blocks. If a peer transmits invalid blocks or bad transactions it will be banned. Miners prioritizes speed above validation so it's up to nodes to discard these if miners try to propagate them.

It does matter. Having a good interconnect network is vital for a cryptocurrency. If at launch the 2x network isn't well connected it will have issues with propagating blocks and transactions. It will also cause a lot of spam when every proper bitcoin node has to ban all the 2x nodes at once. New btc nodes might even find themselves isolated due to congestion and only having 2x neighbours (unlikely as that is).
Banning nodes that don't want to follow the same rules as you is good housekeeping practices and will prevent you from receiving a lot of spam at split day as well as opening up more resources for proper nodes to be better connected.
A network without 2x nodes also helps SPV wallets from getting 2x blocks which might cause problems.
In a perfect world all 2x nodes would be kicked before the split making accidental double spends that much more unlikely even if a malicious node operator still could.

I'm all for changing the basic bitcoin to a more reasonable value and using metric for the rest. KiloBTC or so. But shortening it to bits is just so stupid as there are already to many things called bits.
There should be a yearly review where bitcoin is set to the 000s closest to say an average of dollars, pounds and euros. We could even keep the bitcoin as it is and have an "adjusted btc" to use day to day. The problem is what to call this unit. ABTC, normalized btc, basic, or whatever.
No one really wants to drop the "bitcoin just hit $10000!" excitement either. 
So this year since we're in the thousands of dollars range an aB (adjusted Bitcoin) would be a thousands of a Bitcoin. So now 1 aBs would be $9.5. You could even make sure to set the aB one decimal below the value as it's easier to count up so 10aB would be $9.5 today.

There is a problem with LN where if you lost your state and inadvertently publish an old one. This is a know fact and will be equally true for channel factories. This is also one issue for watch towers since they might have to handle a lot of data.
There is a proposed solution where you have a punishmentless LN where the most recent transaction only delivers the final state to both participants. That way if you lost the state you would just publish the one you have and the other party would then publish the latest and you both get your funds (the other party could of course publish any state so you could lose funds but it's better than losing the entire channel by default. This system would also mean that a watch tower would only need to have one transaction per watched channel lessening the load considerably.
But neither channel factories, watch towers nor punishmentless LN systems exist currently so to argue about fine points in regards to their implementations isn't very useful.
The main point is that the proposed system for channel factories is trustless and as long as you periodically watch the blockchain no collusion between the other members would cause any loss of funds. At worst a non-cooperative member could cause a fall-back to on-chain with a rather lengthy delay until your funds are available again.

The seller just prints a QR code and uses his phone.
This has more or less ruined any chance of in person bitcoin transaction becoming mainstream here since the bank app is so much easier to use. My country is one of the most cash-less in the world and even my parents in their 60s have little to no issues with using this system.

I agree, from what I've read about mimble it might become bitcoin 2.0 if they can get it to work. But I'm also slightly worried about the loss of data a mimble network would lead to. Some of bitcoins strength actually is the way that every transaction can be seen. We can know how many coins there are, how much coins are moving. It's possible to see trends and do other economic science.
I also fail to understand how to start a new node if every old "irrelevant" transaction is discarded. How do you verify the network from a know-nothing startup?
But if ever a serious mimblewimble network is started I'll probably throw some gpu at it.

Yes and in a channel factory the punishment transaction will likely have a timer as well to allow another participant to publish a layer channel map.
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:29:00
That's incorrect as far as I know. Every new channel in a channel factory system has to include the closing of the old channels. The money that A and B are transacting are included in the punishment transaction that C has. So if A and B try to publish their old state then C has the transaction data needed to take the money. 
In a channel factory you set up "virtual channels" with all the money from the original pool. But these virtual channels are always directly dependant on the previous state. So A and Bs channels to C will contain all the data needed to punish any old channels between A and B.
There is no trust. The problems with channel factories is that every closure to the blockchain is on a long timer so that every factory participant has the ability to punish if able and new "virtual channels" need the participation of every member to be setup.
Single virtual channels can be controlled entirely by the two parties on that channel. Setting up and closing down channels require all factory members to sign off and receive the appropriate punishment transactions.

If you rely on zero conf you are essentially running a trust based payment system. As with all other trustbased systems (cashier's checks, credit cards and so on) you will need secondary systems to enforce trust: collateral or knowing the customer.

No Charlie can only take the funds that he has in the latest state as well as the funds that Alice tried to steal from him. Other participants has to punish Alice for their amounts.
There are no "made up" coins in a LN or a channel factory. Every coin is accounted for and every coin has a current owner that can claim that coin if needed. If Alice tries a fraud she will lose her funds but she can't cause anyone else to lose theirs.
Every coin in a factory is always in one and only one channel. If Alice becomes fraudulent everyone who's coins are in a channel with Alice can take the entire amount of that channel leaving Alice with nothing.

A normal factory close will involve every participant agreeing on the current state and publishing it with instant payout. A non-cooperative closeout will require some waiting. The amount of time you all need to wait is decided when the factory is set up. Only those channels with one uncooperative partner will take the full amount of time since all the other channels will be closed the instant both parties publish their latest state.

This is quite basic. A rich white male, me, talking shit about other white males can't be racist in any way since it's my own fucking race and social demographic.
Racism is the oppression of someone due to that person's ethnical heritage. For something to be racist the element of oppression is key. A slave making fun of his masters can't be racist. Descriptions can be used for racist purposes but that doesn't make descriptions racist. 
The fact that in general "black" people are poorer than "white" people isn't a racist fact, it's demographic data. The fact that poor people are more likely to commit violent crimes is not a racist fact. The conclusion that "black people are more violent" is a racist conclusion, partly because it's wrong and partly because it's used as an excuse to exercise racism.
I'm not oppressing rich white people, so it isn't racist. I am rich white people so me being racist against myself isn't really a thing here either.
Also this libertarian, land owner, creating your own society bullshit is demographically a white rich male activity, even though there of course are others outside the demographic that falls into the same mental pit.

I'm not a dev and I haven't really read up on multisigs (channel factories?) but why would Charlie sign off on any transaction without having a "punishment transaction"? If the money at one point has been in Charlie's disfavor then he should at all times make sure to have an appropriate way to punish transgressions. If Charlie does not but instead decides to trust Alice and Bob then the system is no longer trustless and losses will happen. Every new state in the multisigs transaction chain should always contain a punishment transaction for every participant in the channel even if the transaction technically is only between some of the members.

There are only two ways to close a channel in a channel factory.
1. Publish your states
2. Ask the entire factory to create a new channel map
If you publish your states you will close every channel in the factory. Every other participant will then have the option of publishing their states which will cause the latest total state to become the valid one. If Alice publishes an old state every other participant will have the secret needed to claim any channel with Alice in its entirety.
If you ask the factory to close and reopen channels then every other channel member will have the transactions needed to invalidate any and all old channels.
The ability to punish only exists once the factory in its entirety is published to the blockchain. Unless this happens the punishment transactions are completely invalid and useless.
Charlie has no ability to crack open any channels between other but he does have the ability to force everyone to publish their latest state and close down the factory. When a factory is closing every participant will publish their latest state and get their money, if someone tries to publish an old state they will lose that and only that channel.

Currencies have diffrence key formats. But the ledger or similar doesn't actually store any of those adresses.
The whole point of HD keys is that they are deterministic. Think of an algoritm that generates keys for a specific currency as a black box with two inputs. The first input is the seed (often in the form of a couple of words) the other input is an incrementing number. If that number is 1 you get one keypair if it's 2 you get a completely different keypair.
So the ledger contains the seed and you install different apps that are the algorithm. Then your computer asks for keys 1-100, or something, and checks if there's any coin there. Since the algorithm is always the same (deterministic) it can be uninstalled and reinstalled from the ledger and as long as the seed is the same the resulting keys will be the same.
So as long as a currency has a key generation algorithm that can accept a standard seed then you can use a hardware wallet (together with compatible firmware/apps) to generate how many keys that you need.

Why would you close a couple of channels per month?
In a working bitcoin economy you either get paid in bitcoin and can thus receive some or all of these payments to your LN channels or you are buying bitcoin with fiat and the exchange can send coins to you via LN. Neither of these options require the user to close or open channels very often once you have a couple of good connections.
Also neither hub-n-spoke,  a federated node system or any other type of "kinda centralized" system are a problem in an anonymous, permissionless and trustless system that can fallback onto the most decentralized system on the planet. A large hub can't censor its users because it doesn't know whos transactions it's routing. As long as you can get some channels with anyone on the network you can reach everyone. A hub can't differentiate between traffic from a neighbor or traffic from a neighbors neighbor, not in any way.
LN is not dystopian in any possible way since it's just a volontary micro-transaction layer.

There is no completely safe way to store your seed. This is the key concept here. So your job is to minimize risk by minimizing the amount of people that have realistic access to your key.
Digital storage is the worst option of them all. Anything connected to the internet has a potential attack surface of millions if not billions of people.
Storing they key in your head is dangerous. Brains are rather bad at remembering things exactly and rather small accidents or trauma can cause us to forget.
House's gets broken into, of course, but it's very rare. Those that break into houses are not looking after notes with words on them, they are after jewelry, computers and tvs. If someone break in to steal your seed words then they are targeting you specifically. If someone is targeting you specifically then the $5 wrench attack will get your key out of you as well.
Best practices are therefore:
* Never keep your key on anything that's online no matter how encrypted
* Never blab about how much cryptocurrency you have
* Never keep all your funds in one wallet
* Have spending wallets and cold storage wallets with different levels of security 
* Have a solid plan for how your loved ones can get to your funds if you die or get incapacitated

You are confusing currently and fully operational. No one is arguing that LN currently has anywhere near the services, software maturity, user base or amount of channels needed to operate fully.
You argue future malfunctioning due to current day services, it's silly. 
Anyone in a channel can close the channel but unless both agree the closing party won't have immediate access to funds, thus channel closures will mostly be cooperative. Hubs that maliciously close channels will not get new channels and without channels it isn't a hub.
And for the last fucking time: **the LN is a micro-transaction layer.** You don't need capacity to receive or send **big** transactions because **big** transactions ain't the LNs fucking thing. T

Bitcoin transactions that haven't been included in a block have happened. The money are still in your adresses. Most wallets will lock those funds since trying to spend them on something else after you've submitted the first transactions is technically a double spend attempt.
Some more advanced wallets will let you spend the same coins but instead perhaps send them to yourself with a higher fee. I don't have any exact knowledge about how this is done since it's a gray area. Hopefully your wallet will "time out" the transaction after a while but at any point a miner can decide to include it and your coin will be spent.
Never "resend" a bitcoin transaction instead always try accelerators or replace-by-fee systems.

Self balancing system
How hard is this to grasp? If mining gets too expensive some miners will leave thus making mining less expensive. Mining is a constant equilibrium where most miners gets enough to cover costs of hardware and electricity with some profit.
This also means that bitcoin is secure even if the difficulty drops since you will always lose money by trying to get a lot of malicious mining capabilities from scratch. As long as the difficulty doesn't sink really really low.
If a miner wants to pull out then just let em go. Fuck miners, they do work, they get paid. If they don't want to do work, then they don't get paid. Bitcoin doesn't have a responsibility to cater to miners. Lately some offshoots from bitcoin seems to think that miners should be a political entity, that miners by their very nature deserves respect. Fuck that noise.
Miners are supposed to be motivated by rational self-interest. Not respect or political power. If it's no longer in a miners self-interest to mine bitcoin then we are both better off without one another.

That isn't exactly correct. LNs are supposed to offload the chain causing the mempool to not be full. If after the layer 2 solutions and the segwit/batching/merkle/and so on we can't keep the mempool low we will have to increase the blocksize. The point is that a blocksize increase gets more effective the more we work on mitigations now.
LNs will not scale bitcoin by themselves, they are just an important piece of the puzzle.
Getting a transaction into the next block can always be expensive, getting it into the next 10 or so blocks should never be. LNs help the instant transaction needs, for less time critical applications there are other solutions as well as direct on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:08:02
All LN channels are 1 to 1. You would have to attack every channel individually. If a node is getting penalized, proving it tried to steal funds, I suspect everyone else that has channels to that node would close them out immediately. So an attacker would have one chance then his entire channel network would get closed out and he would have to start all over again.

This is true even with watch towers. I can send coins from one adress to another via multiple hops, perhaps even multiple other currencies. No one can ever know which funds actually moved. The transactions on the LN are obfuscated with tor routing.
Watch towers deals with your direct channels. They don't know who you're actually sending money to. The watch towers are designed to know as little as possible. So yes even with watch towers you could easily "go dark". The exception would be if every node the entire way used the same watch tower and updated the tower instantly and didn't have a lot of other transactions to route, but that's extremely unlikely.

A shitcoin is a coin with poor tech or a coin that has been set up solely for the creators to make bank. Eth doesn't fit.
It's absolutely okay to be weary about eth due to the massive failure that was the DAO contract bug and the subsequent split. It shows quite clearly that eth can't be trusted to be decentralized yet. It might achieve that in the future though.

No. The bitcoin network can easily run on tor or other obfuscation systems, heck there's even satellite bitcoin. Now if some entity were to control the entire internet then yes bitcoin could be halted. But as long as one node survive it can always be restarted and if there's a couple of nodes then the system can reach consensus again.
It's safe to say that the resources needed to shut down bitcoin are beyond the grasp of any singular political entity in the world right now. Bitcoin isn't invincible, though. It can still be killed through a lot of effort (spam, laws, police crackdowns and so on) but that will take quite some time.

The delay is configurable but I believe the default is one week. It might be possible to ddos a node for an entire week but the node just has to get one transaction out to ruin the attackers day. 
There will also be watch tower services that you can send your punishment info and they will watch the blockchain for old transactions for you. These towers will be very hard to stop since they are easy to set up and they are impossible to see until they publish a punishment.

No because if money can flow in and out of the system there will be sideband transactions that doesn't involve the company.

This is a byproduct of not reusing adresses not the main purpose. 
The reason you shouldn't reuse an address is that spending from an adress exposes your keys making that adresses slightly less safe. There are as far as I know no actual attacks on adresses that have spent funds but devs have decided to play it safe. The added anonymity is just a bonus.

So what are the uses? There are tonnes of "infrastructure blockchains that totally isn't a risky investment" but what are the actual real life applications? Crypto-kitties?
Why do we need new infrastructure all the time when almost nothing is using the infrastructure we have? There's almost certainly an actually limit to the amount of blockchain infrastructure that humanity needs in the foreseeable future and we are already well beyond that capacity in new clever coins. It's impossible for all these to survive.

Those number were much better than mine. Lets see:
684,490 Addresses with 1 coin gives us 1/11,103 odds, which does put the chance higher than the 1/13,500 for lightning strikes. But a significant (as in statistically significant not the common usage) amount of these addresses are dormant or belongs to companies and multi-account having persons.
So while it is technically possible that the odds favor bitcoin ownership I'm pretty sure lightning strikes have a higher chance in reality.

Basically every new state in the channel is composed of two different transactions that aren't the same. The transaction you have gives the the other party the funds immediately but has a delay on your funds and vice versa.
So if both parties publishes their states then both parties get their coin on-chain as soon as they are added to a bitcoin block.
Now to the theft protection:
Every state transaction also includes a transaction locked by a secret that gives the the locked part to the other party without delay. And this secret is shared as a part of creating a new state.
That means that if I publish an old state the other party will first get the money they have in that state and then while I wait for my money the other party can and will publish a transaction with the secret he now has giving him my timelocked funds as well.
Every new state in a LN channel contains information making publishing an old state a complete loss for the publishing party.

It is a real issue for sure but bitcoin is supposed to be deflationary which means that it will (if it works) never stop gaining value compared to inflationary currencies like the dollar.

The energy use is self balancing. No one mines at a loss. Therefore the price of energy used is always less than 12.5 coins per block now and less in the future.

How does bitcoin privacy work when the ledger is public? You do understand that every transaction on the blockchain in bitcoin is recorded permanently as it is?
The same answer. It's inherently difficult to know which address is connected to which person. In LN it's even more difficult since you would only share one hop of a multihop transaction.
You don't identify yourself to a watch tower you just give them a couple of transactions they can only use if certain conditions happens on the blockchain.

It's high risk for the attacker as he stands to lose the entire channel as well as having his other channels closed out as soon as the network detects that he's being punished.
Sending ready made penalty transactions to a watch tower shouldn't compromise your private keys in any way.
There is a higher risk with LN in comparison with regular bitcoin in that you have to have your keys on a device connected to the internet. That's why LN is supposed to be a microtransaction/spending account and not a savings account.

Bitcoin is a generation one cryptocurrency. This doesn't make it bad or good in itself but since blockchains are hard to change it does mean that it will invariably be dragging some technical debt over time. There are several "research coins" that could potentially do things better than bitcoin (and of course there are many that do things worse). 
If you are in the camp that feels bitcoin is perfect and that the white paper is law then perhaps the bch crowd is more to your liking.

If most A are Scams and B is a member of A, does that make B a Scam?

There's also the fact that the ridiculous fees meant that some people just didn't transact even when they wanted to. So we have the real transactions during the feepocalypse as well as the potential transactions that were priced out by the feepocalypse.

Except ETH wasn't hacked. It wasn't a bug in the protocol. It was the DAO, a client software operating on the ETH system that had an unintended feature that let the individual access a large amount of funds.
The problem is that the DAO explicitly said on its website that **the code was the law**. The site would try to clarify the rules but if in conflict the code would always take precedence since a smart contract *is* the code. The entire point of smart contracts is that there is no interpretation. It is what it is and nothing else. So the function the bad actor used to drain the DAO was in fact completely legal to use. It was not a hack, it was an error of intent of the ones that created the contract. But since the DAO claimed the code was the law the "hacker" did nothing wrong.
Forking the entire ecosystem because a coder on a client application messed up is never ok. Never. The immutability of the ledger is more important than single clients.

So you don't realize that runaway pollution isn't a thing in a self-limited system.
We have many systems on our planet that keeps on growing in energy usage all the time but bitcoin is not one of them. The halvenings will keep it down as well.
It's not like the fiat banking system is run on air either. The whole thing is a cost-benefit analysis and in the long run bitcoin is likely better for the environment than many other forms of currencies. It isn't like bitcoin mining is wasting energy, really. They are converting energy to securing a financial system. And the amount of energy is almost never more than blockrewards x blocks per day in fiat currency that pays for electricity.
That the developing world is entering the "everyone has a car and eats meat every day" phase is worse in every conceivable way.
In short: 
1. To reduce pollution we need effective powerplants. 
1. Effective powerplants are large powerplants. 
1. No one builds large powerplants if there isn't a need. 
1. Mining can drive the need. 
1. Once there is adequate power supplies society can adopt away from dirty power. 
1. Power costs goes up. 
1. Miners move to the next underdeveloped power area.
The environment does absolutely run off a balance sheet. Currently our carbon footprint is deep in the red. Bitcoin mining likely does fuck all to that number, in some scenarios it even improves them as large powerplants needs a steady rate of consumption to stay effective.

Just a minor point:
While Jihan, Roger and friends are some of the main forces behind BCH it would very likely have existed without them. As with almost all cryptocurrencies no single entity have the amount of control or influence that they think they have.
Bcash launched at the end of the s2x but before segwit activation because of necessity (in their minds) since it's a lot easier to just never activate segwit than it is to somehow remove it after the fact. So the timing isn't politics it's pure coding complexity.
To me the whole s2x was never purely about one thing or instigated by a single entity. It was a complete failure and if it had gone through it could very well have killed bitcoin as it would have firmly established a bitcoin "leadership". Is it reasonable to ask for a short term capacity increase? Sure. But the rest of the s2x package would have put miners and business owners in charge of the rules at the cost of the users. This is bad and this is more or less exactly how bch is run today.
Most people on the "other side" are very dismissive regarding the USAF claiming it had no real effect and so on but I firmly believe that it showed the market that regular users would not roll over when some backroom deal tried to establish a de facto bitcoin leadership cabal.

So let's try the math a bit.
I'm going with american number here since they are the ones I could find.
[This page]( indicates that the odds of being struck by lightning is 1/13,500 over your lifetime.
Now the "odds" of someone owning a bitcoin is a bit harder since it's constantly changing over time and will decrease over time as well. Calculating odds over a lifetime is also very hard so I'll focus on the odds of someone actually having a coin right now.
Let's try the best case first. There are currently 16,894,363 bitcoin in existance. That means that the maximum people capable of having one coin is the same number. There's currently around 7,600,000,000 humans in the world leaving us with a best odds at ~ 1/450.
So it's possible that it could be more likely to own a coin. So let's try to up the realism.
There are currently 514,904 active blockchain addresses. Best case is that everyone of those is one person and that every address has more than one bitcoin (this isn't the case of course). This gives us the odds of 1/14,760 and that absolute best case is still lower than the lightning strike risk.
So it is absolutely more likely that you are hit by lightning during your lifetime than it is to own one bitcoin right now.

You don't open a channel to your coffee shop, you open channels to nodes in the network. The coffee shop also has channels to nodes. Most LN transactions will go through multiple hops.
At any point you can close your channels, if the node on the other side is compliant (which it will be most of the time) you get your funds on chain after a block or two. If the node is offline it will take a predetermined amount of time (a few days probably).
The LN network requires all nodes, senders and recievers to be online but it's not like someone has to click accept at every hop, routing will be automatic. Think accessing websites, every server between you and a website has to be online as well and that mostly works just fine.
To open a channel both sides need to commit the same amount of funds but after that you can move your money freely on the LN network. You aren't "locking up" your money, you are moving your money to a second layer where it's more useful and faster.

The penalty window is set when the last non-fraudulent transaction was made and agreed upon by both parties. I don't know what the values is but it's supposed to be days at the very least. It would be very difficult to keep a peer from sending a transaction to the bitcoin network for days and even if you could you wouldn't know if the peer had a watch service somewhere else online. Outsourcing your penalty transactions is safe and trustless and will very likely become a service that some mining pools will provide.

All lightning transactions have a penalty window. The default is a week I think. So there are two ways to prevent fraudulent channel closures.
1. Go online periodically. Your client needs to contact a bitcoin node once a week to get your txids to see that they haven't been sent to the blockchain. 
2. Send a list of TXIDs and penalty transactions to a watch tower.
The mere possibilities of one of these extremely hard to prevent things happening even once during the week long penalty window is very likely enough to ensure that fraudulent behavior is kept at a minimum due to the high risk/low reward equation.

Bitcoin has a function called [nlocktime]( With this you can craft a transaction that can't be spent until a specific blockheight or time.
So you create a paper wallet (or preferably a metal wallet, because, 18 years..). You then send a timelocked transaction to that wallet crafted to lock for the set amount of time. You could also probably have some kind of multitransaction thing that lets you invalidate the transaction if you wanted to. And then you gift the wallet to the receiver.

There are different ways of using the seed to create wallets, yes. I had that issue with ledger and trezor as well. But as far as I know you should be able to send the funds from your keepkey to the ledger directly. There's also probably some webwallets that can use your ledger to look at other versions of the seedwallet.

Yes. The method is the same, possibly. 
But the attack is still dependent on getting the user to do something stupid, as in going to a site that isn't ledger and downloading malicious software.
Once you have the ability to get a user to run whatever code you want pushing bad firmware onto someone's ledger is the least you can do.
It's like claiming that windows has a remote vulnerability because I can get someone to install teamviewer.

Is eth an underperforming coin? Absolutely. Is the market filled with useful dapps? Nope. Is it possible to make useful dapps? Probably at some point. Does eth seen as a cryptocurrency have features and strengths that gen 1 coins like bitcoin lack? Yes. Is eth built upon hype to bamboozle people out of funds? No.
Thus eth doesn't fill any reasonable criteria for a shitcoin. Eth is far from perfect but it's even further from being a scam. And it isn't being pumped and dumped any more than bitcoin is really.
What you feel is a bad investment or not does not a shitcoin make.

The DAO is a client of the ETH network, the alleged hacker is a client of the ETH network. For all intents and purposes both of these entities have the same rights to the networks resources.
The "bug" was in the client software smart contract called the DAO. The DAO specifically said on its website that the code was the contract. If you manage to use a signed contract to your advantage it is **not** a bug.
A buffer overflow in the blockchain protocol that makes a malformed block the owner of millions of bitcoin that didn't previously exist is a bug.
Bugs are fixed, poorly written contracts are still binding contracts. One is a system error, the other is a client error. If we have to weigh a users rights against the system the system have to win. We cannot let some user take priority over another on a whim.
Bitcoin: user vs system - system has priority
ETH: user vs user - no one should have priority

I stay optimistic by having been in bitcoin since 2010.

When the dips come I usually just take a step back and stop checking anything bitcoin related for a while.

Lightning doesn't rely on consensus. You just need both ends of a channel to understand each other, that's a very small consensus indeed. A lightning channel is at its a core a basic on-chain transaction. This will not change in new versions of lightning. 
Everyone that follows obscure guides to put bitcoin into experimental software should expect to lose funds. Being at the bleeding edge has a cost. It does however also provide valuable data and acts as an incentive for the market to adopt.
If you run experimental and unsupported software, fuck up and then expect help from the devs you are an idiot.
I for one feel a little reckless :)
And no, you don't harm lightning by running it on mainnet. Not in the least. The LN devs have zero obligation to the people who run their software in unsupported ways.

If the chain is changeable you no longer have a blockchain. You have a very inefficient distributed database. 
If you are going to trust the majority to not change your transactions after the fact then the system can never be trustless nor secure.
The blockchain is a timestamping system. If you allow the system to change past actions it is no longer useful as a timestamping system.
These are not minor philosophical issues. These are absolute core values on which the entire bitcoin system rests. You never ever allow voting on transactions.

yes we can. If we suddenly lose all Chinese miners we would get perhaps up to 20 minutes per block for a couple of weeks.

Being on the crypto rollercoaster is fun but I really want to be able to retire early and just enjoy the rest of my life and to do that I need a steady flow of money and cryptos doesn't follow that model yet, if ever.
And at some point more money just isn't that useful compared to the stress of seeing 60% of your net worth disappear over a week or so.

Not really. It's more of an electricity grid equalizer. Wherever there is a surplus of electricity mining can be profitable which lets power companies build up capacity before there is actual use for it.
I also suspect big mining ops to start providing waste heat for central heating systems in countries where such things are common. Personally I use my GPU to heat my room in the winter and make a small profit.

Nope, the closeout will only show the channels you have with your peers. It won't show where the money came from if it made more than one hop.
The bitcoin network will only see you and a peer opening a bidirectional channel and then closing it with some more coins in your favor. The actual source of the coins in your favor can't be traced as long as channels are used for multiple transactions and routing. Peers on the LN will be incentivized to forget old transactions since having non-valid states lying around is a security and financial problem.

This is still bullshit. There's no proof that asicboost has ever been used on the mainnet and there has been no evidence that  hardware capable of covert asicboost even exists. Covert asicboost requires an amount of onboard memory that today's mining hardware doesn't have. And since bitmain is absolutely selling out their old miners for new ones all the time the cost of not having their asicboost hardware sold second hand would eat all the asicboost profits.
Chinese miners and bitmain do a lot of shady shit, no doubt, but until we have actual proof it's just plain stupid to keep spreading this FUD.

I mean if he was absolutely pleased by BCH then why does he still hold vast amounts of BTC, why does he keep on bashing core and spreading FUD. In my mind once you've split off you are free and can stop the feud.
I'm getting the creeping suspicion that Ver isn't pleased about BCH at all and is still working to subvert BTC into some kind of miner controlled entity with him and his cronies in the driving seat.

We might need a 2x increase in block size in the short term. We absolutely do not need to give control of the reference implementation to the btc1 team. And we absolutely do not need to move for a hard fork this close to segwit activation.

Simply put:
A company is selling tokens (tethers) they claim are 1:1 "backed" by dollars (not in a legal sense but still they are supposed to always be worth 1 dollar per token). This is useful for exchanges that operate without KYC and regulation because they have a "dollar" people can trade against. It's also useful for people who want to "step off" the crypto roller coaster for a bit.
Lately there seem to be a massive influx of these tokens. At the same time the company that that produces the tokens don't seem to have a bank connection. So if multiple millions of dollars are flowing into the company where do they come from? The company has lost its banking and it isn't properly regulated or audited. If it is the case that the company is printing tethers without backing there will be significant losses as tethers will crash horribly.
You should never ever take advice from strangers on the internet, but still, get the hell out of tethers.

Actually quite hard to say. I'd say probably both. 
It is clear to me that there has been concentrated spam attack by miners in order to drive up mempool size and fees at politically opportunistic times. Doing these attacks aren't free though so that's why they can't run them all the time. I expect that once we get closer to 2x activation day the mempools will once again be full and fud-accounts will be swarming the boards screaming about fees and block sizes. 
Luckily segwit and later lightning will make these attacks less and less useful and the rising price of coin will make them more expensive.

A well working client will never publish an old state. You need a system configure specifically to be malicious to do that.
To avoid damage if someone else publishes an old state to steal from you, you need to have some system watching the blockchain. You could have your own bitcoin node or run some SPV type client that listens to new blocks and transactions.
Or you could upload the fingerprints of your channels to some service and let that service keep a watch.
I believe it would be trivial to design a punishment transaction that allocates some of the money to the watcher thereby making the watcher very motivated.
Publishing a state means to send a transaction on the regular blockchain so it isn't something that can be done covertly. The malleabillity fix in segwit means that it's very easy to see if a certain txid has been published.

Well this is actually something both sides, at least those who'we read up, agree upon. 
For every increase in blocksize there will be a percentage of devices that no longer have the capacity (CPU, memory, storage or bandwidth) to run a full node. Bitcoin decentralization depends on there being a lot of full nodes that all have the blockchain. As long as the blockchain exists, Bitcoin exists.
Currently bitcoin isn't under serious attack and that have lead some groups "big blockers" to think that it's worth kicking out a few nodes in order to increase throughput. Others, "small blockers", believe that decentralization is an absolute priority that must not be compromised and as such have tried to come up with other systems to increase throughput without killing nodes.
There are of course many other concerns and facets of this conflict but this is one of them and it's important.

The lightning network is an open source project with at least three separate entities working on client software. These companies might be for profit but the code and the network is open and free. Standard open source development really.
Many companies are working on ways to exploit the blockchain for commercial gain and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they give back in dev time and open code.
Much of the driver level code for say Linux is provided by for profit companies that want their products to work with Linux, I have several friends that have written drivers and other modules on company time that were submitted and accepted into the kernel fully open sourced.
Open source is fantastic but devs need to eat. Many companies realize that they can profit from taking part in open source.

This is the easiest paper to find: 
I had another source at some point. I'll go look.
The point isn't really that a raspberry gets knocked of today. The point is what happens next year and so on. The blocksize increase have to be proportional to the amount of nodes killed. The only way to research this is to first enable segwit and friends, see if it offloads as it's supposed to and then start raising the block size very very carefully.
It is an indisputable fact that the blockchain can't, in any form, handle all the worlds transactions, which is one of the aims of the entire project. So I and other small blockers feel that a very restrictive block size now will force the ecosystem into more high throughput layer 2 solutions as soon as possible. Then we can increase the blocksize so that it can handle the layer 2 traffic which is supposed to be orders of magnitude less than the "everything on-chain" approach.

It would actually be useful for games to use blockchain tech to create items. That way duping would be close to impossible and the rarity of a thing would be easily checked. It would also allow people to display "valuable" things in their personal space in VR or such and people could see that they were the real thing.
Game publishers like steam could have a crypto that they could let devs use in their games without having to worry about some games generating to many achievements or trading cards or whatever.
Many games are about artificial scarcity and blockchains could be very useful in keeping this up and letting games move assets between them in some manner.
But letting a general use crypto like bitcoin into a game isn't a value add proposal for devs. It just means there will be a lot of money moving out of their games instead of just going in.

Local peers are kind of pointless though as you aren't really on the lightning network then you just have a payment channel. The point of LN is to have a network of nodes that you route your payment across and for that you need internet.

Mining in China is a way to transfer capital. You spend local currency to set up and run a mining operation and you get untracable bitcoin that you can convert to any foreign currency that you want. Large miners have no interest in Chinese currency they want dollars or euro. It would be trivial for a large miner to accept Yuan from a local "businesses man" to run their miners and then just pay that person the same amount in bitcoin.
Chinese bitcoin mining is a way to turn Yuan to USD without government control. It's almost impossible to stop, even more so now with satellite blockchain. Miners aren't selling coin in China.

What the exchanges usually does is that they let you split your bitcoin into two futures tokens, one token_btc and one token_b2x. Then you are free to trade with these on the futures market and when/if the split occurs the exchange will credit you bitcoin or bitcoin2x in accordance to what tokens you have. This has been done before when the chain has been close to a split.
Now if the split doesn't occur then the token_b2x's will become worthless instantly. You can't withdraw the tokens nor move them to other exchanges either.

r/bitcoin is a sub devoted to the discussion of bitcoin. Segwit is a key upgrade to bitcoin that has been in the making for years. It's well discussed, well tested and it's a lot safer than a hard fork.
2X is a contentious hard fork that at best generates another alt-coin and at worst causes mayhem on the blockchain. It doesn't follow best practices, it isn't well discussed, open and well tested and it doesn't have the support needed to fork the entire ecosystem over. Without that support a hard fork is comparable to an attack.
So in the end it's quite simple. You are free to discuss most things regarding bitcoin here. You are not free to say that altcoins are bitcoin, nor free to push political agendas that think so. You are not free to discuss attacks as if they are duly vetted "upgrades".

There is also the issue of disk speed and bandwidth. In order to grow to a global economic system we're going to have a lot of users and a lot of transactions. Most of these people will either use centralized services (not really good for bitcoin) or they will use a SPV wallet. Millions of SPV wallets doing transactions means millions of requests from nodes to deliver the headers via Bloom filters. If the node count is low these requests will consume incredible amounts of bandwidth and disk speed.
We need a lot of nodes, we need layer 2 solutions for micropayments, we need more decentralized smart systems based on the basic smart contract functionality that now exists because of segwit.
Bumping the blocksize is technically trivial, developing all these solutions on top of the blockchain are not. We need to focus on the hard issues now before it's too late.

If you have a single point of control you can go after the people there. Attacking cryptocurrencies is hard, getting at people is easier. The ETH/ETC debacle proved that large parts of the ETH ecosystem was controlled by centralized interests. They actually rolled back the chain to help one chain-using entity, albeit a very large and influential one. 
Bitcoin has been rolled back due to bugs that affected the entire network, yes. But it has never been modified to help a specific user. That it's even *possible* to roll back the chain like that makes me lose all faith in the system.
Hackers tend to go after the system, governments and friends tend to go after people and their loved ones.
The only way for cryptos to survive once they start competing with fiat at scale is if there are no obvious places to attack. This is why decentralisation is absolute key to bitcoin's survival even if it doesn't feel that way while everything is going great.

There are several cons. No real showstoppers but things that are imperfect.
1. Payments are bidirectional meaning you need to communicate in real time with the other party in order to find a path and such.
2. Your client needs to go online periodically to safe against fraud or you need to outsource your fraud detection. If you are planning on going offline for a while it might be best to close out your channels beforehand. Outsourcing the detection will mean some possible loss of privacy but it can be done safely and with a profit motive for the detecting part. I suspect miners will soon run detection services over some automatic framework.
3. The nodes need to keep a lot of funds online. This makes them susceptible to hacking. I predict there will be hardware dongles for running LN nodes in time.
4. Pathfinding and such are as of yet not solved. If LN is to grow as we hope there needs to be a lot of work done in this area. What we have now and in the near time is good enough though.
5. The system will add some complexity for the end user in the short term. Once it's mainstream it will probably be mostly hidden to most users.
6. It's more difficult to backup your LN channels than it is to just keep the 12/24 words to your bitcoin seed.
But the advantages far outweigh the cons above and many of them can be mitigated by clever hardware and software.

Also since there's no actual spec for the bitcoin network most people regards bitcoin core as the de facto spec.

I don't actually see it, though. Nodes will be load balancing by default (full nodes will have higher fees for new channels) and you can always fall back to on-chain.
But we don't really know how it will work. Building a somewhat centralized system on top of a decentralized system is better than centralizing the bottom system like BCH increased blocksize will do in any case.

Right now this is something the game companies absolutely do not want. Having cryptocurrency flowing in and out of games would be a nightmare  for publishers. 
* Game life cycle: If a game loses popularity it will be clearly visible and it will cause a "run on the bank" as players try to sell all their gear and move to another game causing a complete meltdown of the games economy.
* Legal issues: having a clear connection between in-game events and real currency will be fantastically complicated legal conundrum. If I capture your character/ship for ransom am I committing a real crime? I'm technically getting real money from you.
* Real value: if players can see what something actually costs instead of it costing X amount of gamer gold makes the players more aware of spending money.
* Gaming laws: These games will essentially become gambling. Most countries have very complicated legal frameworks dealing with gambling.
* Wrong pocket: If players trade with each other in real money the gaming company gets nothing. That's not a good business practice
* Hacks: Games are hacked a lot. With real money in the mix this will be a disaster.
* Underage gambling... Yeah...
* Money laundering: Play mafia and meet real mafia moving funds. Perfect.
* Regional pricing: Many games are priced at what people in a country might pay, not the games "worth". This is very hard when the game runs on a global currency.
* Fiscal issues: company has to have and hold a lot of cryptocurrency. This might suddenly become a massive liability.
In short, this will **never** happen. There is zero actually reasons why a game dev would implement such a system. Sure some indie folks might do it but the triple As? Nah not in a million years.

FUD is an argumentative attack method where you don't actually attack with facts but use emotionally loaded arguments, hearsay and slippery slope speculation to make something seem shady or a bit off.
It's a common tactic and is characterized with phrases like "Some say..", "I hear a lot of people saying..", "It might be well and good but maybe, just maybe...", "It might work as they say but.." and so on.
Also related to concern trolling.

Let's compare different methods in a world where the LN network is up and running large scale.
Task: Buy vpn access
 bitcoin
1. Download wallet (3minutes)
2. Get some coin (Exchange/friend/visa/whatever) 
3. Transfer coin to wallet (~5 minutes)
4. Set up VPN buy (1 minute)
5. Transfer coin to VPN (~5 minutes)
6. Enjoy VPN, every subsequent transaction will take around 2-15 minutes.
Sum: 14 minutes with additional ~5 minutes for every new transaction
 capable wallet
1. Download wallet (3minutes)
2. Get some coin (Exchange/friend/visa/whatever) 
3. Transfer coin to wallet (~5 minutes)
4. Click on the "Yes I'd like to use some funds on the Ligning Payment Network
5. Wait for the LN network bolt to turn yellow in your wallet (~5 minutes more)
4. Set up VPN buy (1 minute) 
6. Transfer coin to VPN (instantly)
8. Enjoy VPN, every subsequent small transaction will now be instant
Sum: 14 minutes with additional 0 minutes for every new transaction (regular transaction times if recipient doesn't do LN or if the transaction is a large one).
The lightning network is absolutely more complex, it won't be more complex to use once the system matures.
Try to compare, in your mind, getting a LN wallet to getting a new VISA card on your new bank account. That's the complexity we are fighting. Not download app and have instant LN because more or less no cryptocurrency can handle instant onboarding unless you trust someone else to do all the work.

Those people who don't want an immutable ledger can fuck right off back to paypal and ask how sellers feel about chargebacks.
The ledger is immutable, money are created in predictable numbers. These are the very foundations bitcoin is built upon. It's the very foundation that banks and financial institutions hate. Without mutability you can't have all the nice tricks they use to screw the world economy time and time again.
It's completely possible to build refund and escrow systems on top of an immutable ledger. The n of m transactions and timelocks as used in LNs allow refunds from bad nodes, this could easily be extended to consumer security for some purchases if you need a trusted party to arbitrate.
But if you want the blockchain to be mutable you can just burn the entire thing down and leave because then we will have gained nothing.

The question doesn't completely make sense but I'll try to respond to what I think you mean.
There are many different blockchains. Each has different properties and size. The power of a blockchain is in the amount of work it has securing it (miners). 
The bitcoin blockchain isn't susceptible to viruses since the transaction script is limited. It's been purposefully made so that loops and other programing primitives are impossible. 
The ethereum blockchain could possibly be used by a virus but all execution is public and every line of code has a cost. Paying to run your virus isn't ideal. It is possible though, I think, to create a more or less autonomous program and fund it to run for years without anyone being able to stop it. But eth apps aren't really good at being a control center for a virus or worm.
All code/script that runs on blockchains are limited and virtualized. It won't be able to break out and infect the node computers.
There has been viruses that uses the infected computer to mine cryptocurrency for the attacker. There has been a lot of ransomware that holds your data ransom for cryptocurrency payouts.
It is possible for a virus to run on its own blockchain in order to secure communication and control. It might be useful as a defense against takedowns and tracking. But the overhead of running a blockchain makes this a non-optimal strategy.

The nakamoto consensus is the blockchain. The blockchain is the information that the nakamoto consensus agrees upon. The blockchain is the important thing here since electronic transmission of money has been around for a long long time.
The blockchain is actually a very crappy database. But the fact that it's immutable is the key property.
There are actual use cases for blockchain tech in the banking world. 
Whenever you have a system of close to equally powerful entities that need to have an absolute agreement on distribution of some asset without needing trusted parties a blockchain is a useful tool.
Another very useful area is product tracking. If every supplier of parts and materials adds it's data to a finished products chain it would help immensely with tracing defects and contaminations. Every part is given a serial number and that number is signed with the manufacturers key together with date and batch number. Every time the part is included in a larger assembly the parts serial is signed into the bigger transaction. It's actually a dream of every person who has worked with ISO standardisations and similar to be able to instantly trace every product you get all the way back to whatever factory in china that made the battery or gears or whatever.
Smart contracts and ICO, while still very much bullshit, will become the future of crowdfunding and distributed organisations.

Also the stakes are high when someone is trying to steal a channel. 
For a theft to go through the attacker needs to publish an old channel state and ensure that you can't see it until it's too late. If you happen to go online or if you have a watch service you will be able to claim the entire channel and everyone on the network will know that the attacking node has done something stupid. So it's very likely that a compromised node will have all its channels closed in short order and become blacklisted from further participation.
In practical terms the mere possibility of punishment will keep nodes honest. In fact most node software will likely discard old states as soon as possible to prevent this.

Well you are not entirely correct.
You see consensus in bitcoin at its most basic is an agreement about what's on the blockchain. It's easy to see the miners and thing that they alone decide what is on the chain because they are the chain builders but that is not entirely correct.
You see blocks have to be propagated, transactions have to be propagated. Users and services has to get the blockchain. This work is done by the nodes. The nodes validate blocks and transactions, those that are not valid aren't propagated around the network. If miners produce blocks that nodes don't accept then there will be a break of consensus. A miner can't work in a vacuum, they need the services, they need users, nodes and ways to pay their electricity and bills. Producing blocks that the nodes discard is bad business.
Consensus in bitcoin is the agreement about what's in the blockchain. Every participant in the bitcoin network is part of that even if they don't produce blocks. Miners are important, for sure, but they can't live without the network.

The chinese miners have spent millions on mining hardware. If china were to make mining illegal then the only options are to move/sell it outside of China or to go underground. 
As far as I understand mining isn't very bandwidth intensive and it's not that hard to hide with tor and friends.
Shutting down mining in China would be disruptive but in no way catastrophic. Best case scenario the miners gets a phase out time like the exchanges and can move or sell their operations in a more planned manner.

Only idiots are against diversifying your portfolio. Taking gains is still gains even if you could potentially have earned more by staying in. I have bought things with bitcoin when they were worth around 30. I don't regret it because money is meant to be used.
Never ever keep a massive part of your wealth in one thing. Spread out. Get some stocks, pay off some loans, buy a house.
If you are going to disclose your wealth to your family think very long and hard about it. Sudden wealth have ruined a lot of relations.

As long as you buy a hardware wallet from a reputable source, check the firmware, and follow all initialization instructions your coins will be as safe as is humanly possible. If you have a couple of thousand dollars in coin and don't have a hardware wallet you deserve to lose your funds.

Mining bitcoin is not nor has it ever been illegal. Selling coins for fiat isn't illegal. Transferring coins to your bank isn't illegal but you will probably have to answer questions about where the money comes from, I would send smaller amounts over time in order to not have all the money get stuck due to some banking overzeal.

Creating an internal currency is very easy. You don't need to worry about supply or demand. You could an create and remove money at will since it's just numbers in a database. 
Converting dollars to in-game is dead easy. You could follow a tutorial and have an ios app that let's players buy coin in a few hours. There's absolutely no need for an advanced system since it isn't real money.
Why would devs want people who want to make money in their game? It isn't a crowd that's useful to the game in any way.
Generation and storage of in game items are completely separate. It's completely possible to generate random items that still conform to rules and scarcity calculations.

Not true. Once the agreed upon transaction is signed by everyone the payment propagates backwards from the payee.
Say we have a path where A wants to send funds to B through hubs H1 H2 and H3. Once all is signed and done H3 sends to B and recieves the key that lets H2 send to H3 all the way back to A. If H3 is knocked out after sending to B, H2 has a transaction to keep the money. H3 would then be SOL. This is also why hubs needs to have very stable connections. It is a very unlikely event but it can happen, I saw a video with one of the Lightning inventors describing it.

Instant as in less than a second. It doesn't matter where the nodes are physically. 
A direct transaction takes on average about 5 minutes for 1-conf. It can take a lot to longer in worst case. A LN transaction takes less than a second almost every time. Are worst it takes as long as a regular transfer.
TOR routing means that the hubs do not know what they are routing or for who. There is no data to mine. It's all encrypted. You communicate directly with your counterpart. It's only the money that's routed.

It seems that you don't really understand what the Lightning Network is.
To put it simple you set up a channel with another node. You put in say 0,5 btc and they put in 0,5 btc for a 1 btc channel. This is the transaction that happens on the chain. You and the node can then trade IOUs between yourselves for that 1btc, every new IOU invalidates the previous. These "transactions" aren't on the chain and they are instant. Once a channel is depleted (either you or the other node has 1 btc) or if one of you becomes unresponsive you just publish the latest set of IOUs to the chain and the channel is closed and you receive your coins.
The key features is that transactions are instant and free (other than the first). And if the other party is acting up you can always get your coin out via a standard transaction (with a delay of perhaps a week or so).
The real magic though happens when you have several channels to several people who also have many channels. You can then set up IOU-swaps that let's you pay someone you don't have a channel to. But to keep every node from knowing what's going on you encrypt it in an onion-like manner. Every node only knows that small piece of the puzzle that it can decrypt, not the entire picture and your transaction can go several paths at once. A node never knows if a transaction originates from its neighbor or if it's a relayed transaction from or to someone else.
A node can be compromised sure. And if there are many nodes compromised they can perhaps trace some transactions. But on-chain every single transaction is traceable so worst case you are as safe as a normal transaction.
Nothing prevents you from setting up every channel from its own adress or similar.
There are issues with LNs that aren't fixed, security isn't one of them.

Immutability is the aim of a blockchain. A perfect blockchain is perfectly immutable. Of course no system is ever perfect. 
But that is the same with everything we build. A database is supposed to be a secure storage of data. A car is supposed to protect us from dying in traffic. All things have properties that they try to uphold in an ideal circumstance. It would be pointless to not call it what it is because it sometimes fails.

If 95% of all transacting nodes change then yes the de facto bitcoin changes. But it isn't clear that this is about to happen. There are several economic systems on the blockchain that are vehemently opposed to 2x. There are wallets, exchanges and merchants not in on the NYA cabal. The issue is that these nodes aren't as visible as the miners since miners gets to publish their support on the blockchain.
What OP is saying is that miners do not rule absolute, if a miner can't use his coinbase money, if his blocks aren't propagated properly then the miners who do follow the node rules will get the block rewards.
At 95% percent or so it's a moot point but down at 70% or lower it starts becoming a risky move to produce orphanable blocks. Soon updated nodes will begin to exclude 2x nodes from their peerlists which will further hurt the propagation of 2x blocks.
I believe that if enough doubt can be pushed onto the miners most of them just won't switch due to the possibility of not getting rewards overtakes the possibility of making more money or having more say on 2x.
It becomes a cash vs ideology stand and I'm betting cash is king. Of course if 2x gets widely adopted then this mechanism will work the other way.

There will probably be several different LNs. Some will be focused on decentralization and anonymity. Others will be focused on throughput. The throughput LNs will over time become more centralized as large hubs will be able to earn more.
But we have to look at the reasons why decentralization is important here. Decentralization isn't a useful property without a purpose. Bitcoin uses decentralization in order to achieve resilience from attacks and security through many eyes. Since a LN channel can always fall back to using the blockchain it doesn't matter if LN is more centralized. Knocking out or seizing a LN hub would not kill the network since all transactions are safe.
Big blocks will centralize the base blockchain layer and that can potentially harmful the entire system,

There is no such thing as “just a database”. A piece of paper is a database. 
The important thing is the properties of a database. Who can write, who can read, how is it backed up, how is it audited, who owns the data?
You can implement the above scenarios in a database. You can even implement bitcoin in a database (exchanges do). But what we want is immutabillity and consensus. We want the data to be accessible by everyone involved without gatekeepers and we want the data to be impossible to change after it's added.
Blockchain tech is all about trustlessness. When it comes to product tracking we don't want Foxconn to be able to change which factory made a part once the investigation is under way.

If you would take the time and understand LNs you would understand why this cannot be the case.
**LNs are trustless**
You don't entrust a "hub" with your coins. The coins are always cryptographically secured and no one can take them without your key\*. If a node goes down you can reclaim your money after a set time. If a node goes bad you can get the entire channels worths of coin. It doesn't matter if the hub is run by the federal reserve, the CIA or the Chinese state, they can not take your coin because LNs are *trustless*. It's mathematically impossible to have a "backdoor".
**LNs are anonymizing**
LNs routing is based on onion routing like TOR. A "hub" don't know exactly who's transactions it's routing and it might not even know where the transaction is going. A "hub" will have little incentive in actually finding out who it's talking to since it's often difficult and it's mostly useless. As long as the "hub" doesn't know nor care about who's transactions it's propagating it has a better protection against the money transmitter laws as well, similar to miners.
\* as long as you keep a periodic watch on the blockchain

If you prune the chain you lose history. If you lose history you can no longer verify it. Thus you have to trust the entity that gives you the pruned chain. Trust is bad. Bitcoin is trustless.
The blockchain is an unbroken verifiable chain of signatures going back to the genesis block. The only part you have to trust is that you got the right genesis block. Everything else can be verified on you own computer if you install a full node software.
160 gig of transactional data is an extremely low price to pay for this unprecedented level of trustlessness.
After you have downloaded the entire chain and verified it you are free to prune out the parts you don't need. Local pruning is just fine. But a global pruning of the blockchain is an extremely bad idea.

No there isn't. There are a few blocks on the testnet that are verified as asicboost. But that's overt asicboost, it's somewhat easy to spot. Covert asicboost is, as the name implies, a lot harder.

That's the problem isn't it. It feels like just a simple change in one file right? Just a small simple fix, no biggie...
Of course that isn't the case, blocksize is a fundamental concept that controls many aspects of bitcoin. Blocksize controls the growth of the blockchain, blocksize controls how many orphans we get, how blocks can propagate over the system, the time it takes to sync new nodes. Blocksize regulates the fee market (for bad and for worse). It might even be easy now but what happens in five years? In ten? Do we keep upping the size? Do we actually expects a global economy fitting into a single block every ten minutes? What does that give us? Gigabit blocksize? Who can run those? Do we need a google like level of servers just to run a node?

A working LN will be as easy as downloading an app to your phone and sending some btc to it. The rest of the complexity will be handled completely by the system (there are already simple guis in alpha). It is kinda like a pre-loaded credit card in use but extremely different behind the scenes. There is no need for trust and no one can take your money without your consent. At any point in time you can cash out your channels and no one can stop you. You control the wallet, not visa or your bank. The fees are really really low as well. Were talking a few satoshis at most.
The security is wildly different as well. With a VISA you have to trust that the credit card company isn't selling your data or getting hacked (and than never ever happens right?). You also have to worry about skimming and similar types of fraud. In LNs there can be no middle attacks, everything is encrypted between you and the entity your are transacting with. The main danger is if your device or computer is hacked since the keys to a channel has to be kept somewhere. But that's no different from standard bitcoin use. I suspect hardware wallets will be up to the task of keeping the keys safe just as they are with bitcoin wallet keys now.
**Credit card**
* higher fees
* weak physical security (there are still magnet strips ffs)
* weak transaction confidentiality (companies sell you data all the time)
* trustful 
* KYC laws
* extra fees for out of state or out of country transactions (sometimes)
*plus side*
* credit is possible
* the system is in use and most understand it
* works even without electricity (if someone has an old-school swiper)
* much lower fees, no monthly fees
* physical security will likely be high (in phone, hardware wallet or computer with encryption)
* transactional security is extremely high (there are a few edge cases where you can get damaged but they are very unlikely)
* trustless (you own your own money at every point in time)
* no kYC
* global reach
* no credit - might actually be possible with some other type of L2 in the future
* complex right now, will become easy over time as with all other tech
* need electricity, internet and a connection to the blockchain. Also needs to check the blockchain periodically to ensure no one has published an old transaction state.
All in all LNs right now aren't that much better than credit cards but they are better than bitcoin transactions in many ways. Once the issues have been ironed out they will absolutely be better than the credit cards have any ability to be.

Not really. Wallets don't have IPs or other meta data.
But every bitcoin transaction is public so if someone can tie one transaction to you personally they can possibly track more of your coins.
But if you have an adress that isn't openly linked to you and it suddenly got thousands of btc? You're probably perfectly safe but you should still take precautions. There are mixers and anonymous exchanges and such to use.

This article is about the Swedish state seizing assets from a company due to it defaulting on a debt. Normally the seizing authority "kronofogden" takes all sorts of assets and sells them at auction to pay off tax debt and the like. The bitcoin will be sold off like this. It doesn't mean that the Swedish tax authorities accept bitcoin payments or anything.
It's interesting that the authorities have realized that cryptocurrency has value but it isn't anything like what OP is claiming.

The rabbid hordes try to make LN into something it isn't, let's not be guilty of the same thing. LN is still a toy, just like bitcoin was around 2010.

The price is different in countries where there are regulatory or other political issues. As soon as there are barriers preventing fiat from moving freely the cryptocurrency markets will behave very differently. That's why bitcoin to bolivar is extremely lopsided and why coins at least used to trade at a massive premium in India.
The important thing though is that it's very difficult for a normal person to profit from this because the very reason the market is weird is the problem to move fiat into or out of the country.

The signatures are moved out of the block proper, that's true. But they aren't discarded in any way. They are placed in a separate structure **that's transmitted and stored with the block**. A segwit block is the regular block and the witness data. An older client won't see the witness data but a current client understands that a block isn't valid without it. 
An old client can still see the chain but it doesn't understand that the new transactions are segwit, it sees them as anyone-can-spend. But since all miners are segwit-aware those transactions aren't anyone can spend so the security of segwit transactions isn't compromised in the least. The only possible way that segwit transactions becomes unsafe is if a majority of miners suddenly decide to remove segwit capabilities and that is extremely unlikely.
A client **can** discard signature data to save space in the future but if you run a full validating node you won't do that.
Even after segwit bitcoin is still a chain of signatures, just as it always has been. Local chain pruning has always been a thing and it doesn't ruin bitcoin in any way.
I just can't understand why Ver &amp; friends are purposefully lying about this all the time. It's obviously false to anyone that has taken their time and read up on the subject and if it were true someone would have already started hacking segwit transactions en masse.

Empty blocks don't help asicboost either.
Empty blocks as far as I know are often because the miner hasn't had the time to assemble a block and got lucky mining nothing while it was doing the assembly. It has also happened when miners were switching between bch and btc due to bugs. Another reason can be if the miner has network issues and isn't getting transactions as it's supposed to but still gets blocks.
But since covert asicboost depends on reorganizing transactions in a block it doesn't work with an empty block.

Not realistically. Sure you could have a fund or a contract that sends money to some accounts every month but it wouldn't be a working UBI.
It would however be very possible to create a UBI enabled cryptocurrency if it was integrated from the start.
You would need some kind of oracle (outside information) to control enrollment. After that you could make a system where block rewards goes both to the miner as well as to all enrolled accounts. You can't have a deflationary currency either as the rewards to enrolled accounts needs to be stable I'm some way. An alternative would be to make the UBI tokens special in some way. Like that they have to be used in specific time frames or similar.
I actually think that if we could get all government spending based on a blockchain ledger our society would be much improved.

I don't really understand your argument here.
Rent seeking is when you compete not by having the best service but by twisting the legal system to your benefit.
P2P exchanges do not provide a service comparable to regulated fiat exchanges. In fact most of them are crap. Every system using fiat more or less needs trust and p2p is bad for trust. Also most electronic fiat transfer systems have reversibility which is anathema to cryptocurrencies.


Correct, without rules there can be no rent seeking.


An exchange does not compete with P2P exchanges on fees, they compete on services. If at some point P2P exchanges becomes better regular exchanges will likely try to rent seek. That time has not come yet. Regulated exchanges have overhead that p2p exchanges doesn't. Once cross chain atomic swaps are common regulated exchanges will have to compete purely with services when it comes to crypto2crypto trading since a rent seek will be extremely difficult.


You can develop atomic swaps regarding currencies and digital goods. This is an example of a completely trustless transaction. Most transactions where you buy goods do still and will probably forever involve trust. But with crypto you can reduce the amount of trust as far as possible. Buying something via the lightning network is really not functionally different than buying something on-chain or with fiat.
But the entire point is that a lightning node can't rent seek since it doesn't have a spatial or legal position from which to apply leverage on the consumer. A regular bitcoin node/miner can't rent seek either as long as it doesn't control a majority of the network since every attempt at controlling the system will be countered by the rest of the network.
Big banks might have an interest in the lightning system but they have no ability to control it because lightning is a mostly trustless system built upon an extremely trustless system.

There are multiple laws governing bitcoin. It's an asset, it's a computer network, it's software and it's a payment system. All of these have some governing legal framework in most countries.
While bitcoin due to its nature is very hard to stop or even control, it doesn't mean that the people involved can't be sued or jailed for their actions.
Coins that I own are taxable, inheritable and counts as an asset in say a divorce procedure. It's hard to prove that I own them but the law covers them anyway. If someone takes my coin against my will it's still theft.
Attacking the bitcoin network is illegal as well even if I suspect it's very difficult to actually prove what an attack is and who is doing it.

Tradeoffs are:
* Increased complexity - Will hopefully be managed by good software
* Locking of funds - Coins in your channels are locked until channel closure
* Network limits - If your current connected nodes don't have a path to where you want you can't use them
* Checking for fraud - Your client needs to look at the blockchain at certain intervals (once per week/month or so) in order to insure that none of your channels has been cashed out with an older state. Nodes that do this will get quickly banned most likely though.
* Receiver needs to be online - LN is a real time transfer with two active parties. Regular bitcoin transactions aren't.
* Timeouts/attack - If a node in your network stops responding during a transfer it can cause the transfer to fail. If you have a node that crashes you could possibly lose funds that you're routing since other actors will think you've gone bad and reclaims your funds.
Most of these issues are edge cases or solvable by clever software. It's expected that once the system is mature you will seldom be inconvenienced by these issues. You simply put some funds in your lightning Wallet and instantly have extremely fast and secure bitcoin transfers.
The ability for anyone to always get their funds out will ensure that actors and nodes work together. A node with a bad reputation will be excluded from the network very quickly.

When protocols for cross chain atomic swaps matures exchanges will lose all power regarding crypto to crypto transfers as well.

Bitcoin is irreversible. Company taxes are not. There's thousands of laws regarding taxation, tax credits, exceptions, government programs and so on. A company has to keep detailed books. Basing tax on those books is better than trying to upkeep hundreds of different smart contracts.

Minor nitpick. A LN channel is commonly two on-chain transactions. One to set up and one to close out. These transactions can be very far apart though.

No, I'm pretty sure it's called sharding. The theory is that you somehow split the chain internet several shards that you somehow keep in sync, possibly some kind of two way pegging system. Or you have one "master" chain and several sub-chains. 
I'm not extremely read up on it since it seems fraught with issues.
It isn't called centralization though, unless you're to stupid to understand what centralization means.
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:16:59
I'm not talking about eth. We are discussing the theoretical practice of sharding a blockchain, any blockchain. It's possible to "sync" shards periodically to each other. So if you only have one shard downloaded you might only need to verify the new shard you want to talk to since the last sync and not from the Genesis block. This saves space for you and increases the overall speed of the cryptocurrency.
Since you trust your shard you can trust the synced checksums and as such you don't need to verify the entire chain of the other shard. Now syncing is difficult. Very difficult. But solving sharding could be a fantastic step forward in blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:15:48
In most countries it's the company that sells a product that pays the taxes on it. They simply calculate all the products they have sold and send a percentage to the IRS equivalent. You don't need any fancy wallet tricks just normal book keeping.
Bitcoin is a currency. Taxation is done when currency is used. Not all transactions are "use".
You could of course create a system where a payment automatically pays tax but that seems like something better solved with smart contracts and such.

You solve double spend by not letting shards handle addresses on other shards in some way. I don't know really. Perhaps a cross shard transaction needs to be in both shard blocks to be considered valid? Then if you transact a lot with other shards you could move your adresses to that shard via some transaction primitive.
The whole point of sharding, as I understand it, is that you achieve 1000s of tps on the entire network but a single shards workload is a lot smaller. You effectively have 100s of separate cryptocurrencies that have the ability to atomically move funds between them.
There are many issues still. Syncing, miner incentives and cross shard transactions and transfers. You could conceivably link shards together via a lightning style system to enable instant transfers.
I'm not sure it is even solvable but I do enjoy new technology so it is interesting.

Sidechains are possible but until the bitcoin network supports a two way peg they will be of limited use. Current sidechains has to rely on trust to transfer funds out of the chain back to the main chain. A chain with trust as a major component is deeply flawed.

Still, rolling back a network bug is not the same as rolling back the network to help a client. It's different by orders of magnitude. So the same argument is not valid. They are different arguments entirely even if the solution to the two issues was the same.
Personally I can't even begin to understand why the ETH people chose a language like solidity to base their contracts on. To base a smart contract language on javascript is mind boggling.
I've studied some computer science, there actually exist several languages designed to be logically proven. It's an arduous process but you can actually create software that's mathematically proven to never produce unwanted output. That's the type of language I would use for a smart contract platform, not javascript.

SPV wallets are one of the issues. A SPV client will gather information about bitcoin by asking 4 nodes with something called a bloom filter. This is very effective for the SPV but it causes significant disk access for the node. If node count goes down due to bigger blocks and SPV count goes up due to wider adoption we will very soon reach a point where SPV requests are flooding nodes. Even raids of ssds won't be enough.
If we are going to have a LOT of SPVs (likely) then we need a lot of nodes. Companies need to be able to run a node as easily as a small company website. Power users need to be able to run a node without a noticeable cost. 
Every node that disappears makes the eventual strain on the others higher.

ASICs hurt decentralization. Decentralization is an important part of cryptocurrency. A company that builds ASICs will very likely also mine with the same ASICs creating a very unfair market. Cryptocurrency needs a difficulty but the insane difficulties that ASICs leads to isn't really helpful.
Also once an asic is superseded by new ASICs they very quickly become worthless hunks of silicone while gpus can be reused for other things for a long time after.
Thus ASICs helps miners but not the network and miners are supposed to help the network, it's why we pay them.
The only upside of ASICs is that they limit the ability to "switch over" and mine something else wich is something that can wreck havoc with a blockchain. By switching algos or having asicresistant algos you get a better difficulty increase curve wich is healthier for the entire ecosystem (except for the poor gamers who can't find any gaming gpus).
A blockchain ecosystem is a delicate balance and ASICs upset the balance and that's why devs are against them.

Decentralization means that that we all take part. If the NYA goes through then bitcoin is no longer decentralized and that's quite a big philosophical issue.

ETFs are "side-betting" on coins with funds that are normally not usable to buy actual coin. There's no issue with doing both.
I have a stock savings account that is taxed a flat tax per year instead of on my earnings. This means that if I wanted to make more actual usable money per time unit and I was certain bitcoin was going up it would be better to buy an ETF that's pegged to bitcoin.
ETFs are not bitcoin at all of course, but they do have their usage. Investing in funds is a pure profit driven activity, you aren't trying to get ownership of anything you just want returns.
Also I'm unsure about what would happen if an ETF had their coin stolen. I would think they would have the coins insured in some way.

My country has had them for some time. It's useful for betting money on bitcoin from inside your trading account wich has better taxation than just selling regular bitcoin. It's a bit easier getting money out as well as the largest exchanges sometimes gets swamped all to hell. During the last run-up it took weeks for bitstamp to deliver funds while on my ETF I could freely (more or less) move money however I wanted.
Still my trading system provider has warned all users several times to not trade the ETFs because of the volatile nature but as far as I can see they are traded quite a bit.
All in all I'm positive. The main thing to know, though, is that buying an ETF means **betting** on bitcoin, it isn't bitcoin that you're buying.

Sidechains and sharding are very much the same thing just slightly different implementations.
I'm not talking about bitcoin nor ethereum and I'm not talking politics. 
Sharding is a concept, it has strengths, it has weaknesses. How eth are planning to implement sharding is just one implementation. It isn't the end-all be-all of sharding. I don't understand why I have to defend eth all of a sudden. This is a bitcoin forum, no? We don't usually have to defend eth here. 
But sharding isn't eth exclusive, it's simply one possible way forward for any cryptocurrency. And as such I just can't comprehend how you can think a mere theoretical concept a scam? It seems to me that you have difficulties in separating concepts and implementations. I'm not defending any particular implementation I was just mentioning the concept when you began your pointless attack.

Dusting attacks happen, they are now illegally holding your funds. If it's a "significant amount" then it's lawyer time. As the economy of bitcoin grows it will very soon be close to impossible to find any coins that aren't tainted in some way unless you mined them yourself. Coinjoining will probably become more and more common as well. Trying to block tainted coins is a losing game so I wouldn't worry to much.
Also, never ever send a significant amount of your coins to an exchange. The main part of your coin should always be under your own control. Even if you plan to sell it all you should still do it in batches where you always hold the main part of the funds either as fiat or as coin.

Of you transfer your "earnings" to your bank account (which is something I've done several times) then be ready for the tax man.

I am a capitalist. It's the best form of resource allocation system that we have created. It's far from perfect but the alternatives are as yet worse. I'm also a socialist as I believe we should use our resources to help those that can not help themselves as well as give as many people as possible a way to better themselves. I'm also a liberal since I believe that the state should not get to legislate our thoughts, personal morals or what we do to ourselves or other consenting adults. I'm also a pirate party sympathizer since I don't believe in forced intellectual monopolies nor immaterial rights. I'm an atheist because grown people don't need imaginary friends.

no it isn't. You can clearly have one Bitcoin. You can't have one wood (queue the dirty jokes).
Having one bitcoin worth a boatload of fiat is kinda hurting adoption since many people are still unaware about the massive divisibility of bitcoin. But switching to mBTC or similar isn't really going to work since there's really no standard and no community consensus.
My personal wish would be to have an adjusted or pegged btc value (pB?) that's balanced every month or so to be close to a large fiat currency like dollars or euro. So that right now 1 pB would be 0.0001 BTC making 1 pB around 0.9 dollars. If we reach 20 000 dollar per BTC the pB would be rebalanced to 0.00005 BTC.
That way you could see you wallet in pB and prices in pB and have a reasonable understanding of what you are actually buying or selling.

You don't know that no other cryptos works on sharding, now do you? It's impossible to keep track of all of them. Sidechains are still type of sharding in itself and they have all the same issues with miner incentives and coin moving. In order for bitcoin to have reasonable sidechain support we will need to hard fork to get a two way pegging system and I don't see that happening any time soon.
So that leaves us with just layer 2 and while it can do some things extremely well it isn't really cut out to be a scaling solution in its current state. Keeping keys online, crashing nodes leading to channel loss, watch towers that aren't implemented yet and if they are you would have to send quite a lot of transaction data to them and so on.

Compromised as in complaining about a problem while not implementing a new feature designed to mitigate said problem while spending time implementing other currencies.
It's completely possible that this is just an error of prioritization by the devs but it does smell fishy. Especially when you look at press releases and comments made by a lot of companies known to have contacts or interests aligning with certain "anti-core" groups.
While it likely doesn't matter or even register on the "regular bitcoin user" level there is an extreme amount of politics and underhanded efforts going on behind the scenes to position oneself as a key player in what many believe to be the economic system of the future. It's just natural really since only a small piece of the pie now could possibly develop into a multi billion dollar asset in a few years.

Blocks are produced at a probabilistic way. It's possible for a block to take almost no time and it's technically possible for it to take infinite time. But the difficulty is designed to cause most blocks to appear in around 10 minutes. But that is an average, outliers appear now and then. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:49:31
No. 
I'm not an expert but I believe that shorter times would drastically increase the risk of orphan blocks and risk major desynchronization of the consensus. Every time a block is found it has to propagate to the entire network. If block times become too short several versions of the same block might become the basis for a new block more and more often causing frequent transaction reversals and such. 
Other coins with lower block times have systems that reward adding orphan blocks to the current block (eths uncles and so on) that bitcoin don't do.
Raising the blocksize would be much easier for the network to handle. But if we feel that raising the blocksize everytime we have problems then that will eventually ruin bitcoin as a decentralized currency.

A lightning client with no open channels isn't a node at all. A node is a mathematical concept meaning a point that has connections to other points. Without channels you have no connections.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:16:22
As far as I understand the locking up of bitcoin to use in a sidechain is trivial with segwit activated. It's similar to how you lock funds in a lightning channel. But in order to get your money back from the sidechain you either need to somehow trust the miners of the sidechain or you need a way for bitcoin to understand a "locking up/destruction" of sidechain funds. When you leave the blockchain you essentially give the unlock keys to the sidechain network and when you want to withdraw funds you have to trust it to give you your funds back and if the sidechain has some bug or if it's winding down you might be left with nothing. There are many papers and discussions about how to incentivize the sidechain miners to do this but none, that I've seen, seems reasonable.
Sidechains could be a great thing but it seems to me that cross chain atomic swaps and lightning network cross currency atomic swaps would be much better.

Anyone who separates coins into tainted and non-tainted is aggressively anti-bitcoin. Such services or businesses should be ostracized.

There are holy scriptures (the white paper), the lost most pure messiah (satoshi) and the prophets of the true lord (Ver and Garzik) and of course the great satan Blockstream/core and their unholy horsemen of the apocalypse Theymos et. al.
If any fact doesn't fit the narrative it's because core somehow has manipulated the world in order to falsify it.

The technical arguments only hold for core, though. At least until 2x implements reasonable replay protections.
There is no question that 2x will harm the network. Even a non-contentious hard fork essentially kills the network and then restarts it with new rules. A contentious fork is an attack. It's completely valid to want to exclude peers that are planning an attack on the network since those peers uses resources and slots the network will need once the attack starts.
Both sides are not guilty. BTC1/Segwit2x are planning on doing a poorly implemented unnecessary contentious hard-fork with extremely low community and node backing without having reasonable protection mechanisms. Core are trying to mitigate the damage caused. Punching your attacker in the face does not make you guilty of assault.

Posting a white paper as a response in a discussion is just stupid. You argue with your own words not someone else's. If you don't grasp the material enough to carry a conversation on your own you shouldn't be having the argument in the first place. Trying to drown your opponents in URL-sallad is rude and disrespectful. It's also never the way to win a conversation and so it shows a lack of strategic thinking.

Side chains are still very much a debatable subject. Pegging and moving funds from one to the other is not an easy thing to solve. In fact it would probably require some kind of protocol change so that the bitcoin system becomes aware of side chains globally. 
RSK or rootstock is the system that's farthest along and they have to use federated trust for the system to work which should be right out if we're going for a privacy solution. I really don't see any devs willing to change the bitcoin protocol to allow sidechains at this point in time.
So unless anyone has a concrete solution to adding minble to bitcoin I just don't see why this subject pops up in here all the time.

I actually don't see the connection here. GDPR is a framework for protecting personal data, mostly customer and employee related. What's the relevance with a currency/payment system? If you keep your customers credit card data/cryptocurrency adresses you are still susceptible to the same rules.
But most of all, bitcoin is pure math and algorithms. It doesn't really care about laws. If I were to do something stupid like storing personal data on the blockchain it's impossible to remove regardless of laws. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:10:26
It is possible to have rules and standards without a governing body. I mean bitcoin exists. If the calculation of pB is made purely algorithmically it would be trivial for merchants and wallet makers to implement it without a central authority with just some api calls to some major currency exchanges.
But first there needs to be some kind of consensus among enough users.
A quick and dirty algorithm would be to take the average values over one month of the 5 largest fiat currencies and the average value of bitcoin during the same period on the first of every month and create a pB modifier that closest aligns one pB with the average fiat value closest to say one dollar. Or perhaps the value should only be calculated every quarter for better comparison stability.
Showing the price of a product as "1 month = 0.00058 BTC" like it often is today isn't intuitive for humans and actually hinders adoption in some ways. Humans don't handle fractions well so instead sites have to present the dollar/euro price as well as the btc price which creates an unnecessary coupling to fiat (even if my proposed system would be based off of fiat internally)

I think you are somewhat correct but your steps are not a "mature" lightning network. Maturity implies mature software as well.
The more likely scenario is that your wallet will balance and select your payment options automatically. If you micropay a lot it will allocate more funds to lightning during low fee periods or even via other services. It's perhaps pointless to pay your mortgage or other large payments via LN when they work equally well as on-chain payments or perhaps with some future batching payment system.
You will simply see values in your wallet logically sorted in "spending" and "saving". You won't care that a payment is LN or if it's on-chain since the service and your wallet will find the best way themselves.
It's also possible that large "end of month" payments will disappear over time since their existence is because the banking system is a slow transaction system based on sending actual papers between banks. Why not just stream your mortgage and car payments, why not stream your salary.
If you have to think about opening a LN channel or balancing a LN channel then the system isn't mature. There should be systems that means that the second you pick something up in a store you have bought it and if you put it back the transaction reverses. When the delivery guy hands you the pizza the payment happens then and there. NFC, bluetooth, computer vision or even sub-dermal electronics. With LN transactions can be everywhere and instant in any direction.

The main issue I have with this article is that it assumes large banks are necessary for an economy to function. We don't actually know if this is true. Many of our problems today are actually caused by banks and large financial institutions and their propensity for gambling with huge sums of money.
Also every one of the tools that a central bank can use to help the economy during a downturn fucks the regular citizens massively. Whenever they print lots of money or help banks out it's the taxpayer that ends up with the bill.
They purposefully make our money useless in order to encourage spending it. They set the system up so that a middle class person is swimming in debt. Mortgages, car loans, credit cards, student loans and so on.
It's no question, though, that the modern system of liquidity is vastly superior to say a gold standard when it comes to corporations. Having quick ways to get a lot of funds is vital for the kind of growth we have seen during the last 100s of years. But it has also transferred an incredible amount of real wealth into the hands of just a few people on a scale that has rarely been seen before in history.

Well my take is like this. Yes you can get rich on bitcoin but that's not the point of bitcoin. Bitcoin tries to be a currency not an investment.
Look at it like this: you can't predict the bitcoin market, it's not possible. If you could predict it people would be doing that and getting rich which would ruin the predictability. I'm sure there are a lot of traders out there who do get rich but you will probably not be one of them and it still a lot of chance involved.
The only way to profit is to be in it for the long term and the only reason to be in it for the long term is if you actually believe that bitcoin is the future of currency. 
If you treat it as a get-rich-quick, which you absolutely can, you might as well just bet everything on black in Vegas; it's probably better odds.
The bitcoin system doesn't need more newcomers who shows up at the start of a bubble, panic and ends up losing everything. It doesn't benefit anyone.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:35:32
I suspect that the system will gravitate towards that anyway. Since there's no "geographical" distance between nodes every node can technically create a channel to any other node at will. Once a node starts getting saturated it will raise fees to encourage channel balancing and not having too many funds on a live server at once.
I feel this will push the nodes to have mostly a manageable set of channels setup to "distant" parts of the network in order to be able to balance channels with fees.
It all depends on liquidity though. If the network hasn't reached a "critical" state where it can easily handle most transactions then well connected hubs make more sense.
In any case I don't really feel that some centralization is a bad thing here. The entire system still rests upon a very decentralized platform so there is just no centralizing force available when anyone can just fall back onto on-chain transactions more or less at will.

We kinda know why. When a lot of people bet on bitcoin going down it sooner or later is going to go the other way and then the ones who have bet wrongly will have to cover their bets with bitcoin causing a snowball effect. Arbitrage bots will start trading like mad as well as bots that have been waiting for certain economic signals.

Rolling back to fix a bug is not the same as rolling back to help one clients messed up transaction or code. Can you not see the difference here?
The Dao wasn't hacked. The dao's code allowed a kind of transaction that wasn't originally intended. But the DAO was very clear when they said that the code was the intent. The code was the DAO. Once the DAO was realized there was no other intent or meaning except the code. So legally the "hacker" used an available feature to move funds from the DAO to his own sub-dao. You are not hacking when you use software features that are available. I personally see the rollback as a theft from the person who used the fully allowed feature to get funds from the DAO.
The programmers of the DAO fucked up, the designers of Eths transactional language fucked up and those that rolled back a supposedly immutable system fucked up. To claim otherwise is dishonest.
Rolling back the chain due to a bug in the protocol that can hurt everyone is okay, rolling back the chain due to one clients massive fuck-up is absolutely not okay. The protocol has to be protected at all costs, the clients are never to be prioritized above the protocol.

As far as I understand there isn't a "new chain of addresses" that has to be monitored, in fact segwit is written to simplify the watching as there can no longer be any malleability in segwit transactions. One of segwits stated goals is to make hardware wallets and other low CPU systems better.
The only way segwit support is immature, untested or a cause of technical debt is if you are part of the system trying to overthrow it.

Fiat is of course important. The true cost of bitcoin is mining hardware and electricity. Miners need to buy electricity. There are no utilities that take coins as far as I know. Thus bitcoin always have a baseline and thus it has a connection to the fiat world. And even if you disregard fiat there's still an expectation of increased purchasing power in bitcoin, it's designed to be deflationary after all. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:34:12
Mining is self-balancing. As prices go down some miners will turn their rigs off and rewards per hash will go up. As long as it happens gradually there will be no real negative effects on the bitcoin network.
Now added to this is of course that some miners will mine at a loss because they have to get some cash now to pay off hardware and the like. Other mining outfits might have deep pockets and are calculating on future returns.
If a significant portion of the miners were to turn their rigs of at once bitcoin could face serious issues as we need a certain number of blocks before the system can rebalance and if no blocks are found because the difficulty is to high it could lead to the death of bitcoin. But that does seem very unlikely and if it were to happen we would likely see a quick hard-fork to a quicker balancing algorithm, perhaps something like the one used by that silly bitcoin fork.

There might be a reason to hard fork to a larger block size after all the current optimization and offloading efforts are done. There are also some things that newer cryptocurrencies do better than bitcoin that could be incorporated with a hard fork.
The 10 minute block cycle was chosen to reduce the workload and ensure synchronization across the network in face of attacks. Technological progress in computing, storage and network capacity could make changing that limit desirable in the future.
Currently it's very hard to change bitcoin due to politics and the systems inate resistance to change.

This is important even if they aren't using the Bitcoin blockchain. If the concept works and gets recognition it can add at least two benefits to the blockchain. One, technical innovation might seep back into the main branch once quirks are discovered. Two, if you can get this system to work on a private ledger then it's a lot cheaper (server costs) and safer (lots of gigahashes) to offload it onto the main ledger (blockchain) so if they won't do it themselves their competition sure as hell will.

There is a colossal difference in activating a new feature despite resistance and rolling back the chain in order to fix an independent party's fuck-up. The fact that ETH miners are pro saving the DAO just makes it worse. Miners self-interest is supposed to be aligned with not rolling back the chain by design. If a political entity can roll back the chain then the incentive is to weak or the blockchain isn't strong enough.
What happened to ETH is supposed to be impossible by design, the fact that it was possible means the entire system is flawed. The challenges facing BTC are very very different. It might even fracture the entire system, but if that happens then it's just proof that BTC lacks centralized control. The lack of central control is **THE** most important principle of blockchain technology. If your cryptocurrency don't have that then you have nothing.

It's very easy to get caught in non confirmed transaction hell nowadays. Even with wallets that try to calculate reasonable fees you still have to do a manual check so that the "reasonable-bracket" isn't full with tens of thousands of transactions.
I make purchases from time to time and I more or less double up on the suggested fee, which isn't a good solution at all.
A few years ago bitcoin was digital cash. Now it's gotten murkier. This is a major issue and everyone telling you otherwise are morons.
Sadly it seems that the only solution is to form other networks on top of Bitcoin, like lightning. I personally isn't really a fan since it increases complexity and adds a measure of centralisation that bitcoin was designed to avoid. But on the other hand it's clear that Bitcoin can't really handle its own growth so something has to be done. And just pushing up the blocksize like some would like isn't a realistic solution.

A channel **IS** the balance. In the most basic sense a channel is two transactions locking funds, one from you and one from the other party. Without any bitcoin put in there is no transaction and therefore there is no channel, furthermore nodes will close out channels that get close to empty one-way as that increases fraud risk.

Asicboost is an unintended side-effect. It's not a more optimal mining paradigm. Asicboost actively hurts the bitcoin network as it results in blocks that aren't rational from a throughput angle and that's what blocks are supposed to be. If there is incentive to mine suboptimal blocks then everyone of us needs to take steps to fix this bug in the protocol. Rational self-interest is the driving point behind bitcoin, the protocol is designed to make that mechanic work for the network. If rational self-interest isn't helping the network then it needs to be tweaked. 
Otherwise more rational blockchains will eventually take over due to better utility.

The limit is reached asymptotically meaning that the closer to the limit we get the less coins are generated. The hard limit is 21 million and it will take many years to reach but it won't take many years until the payouts are less than the energy required to generate the block. 
The theory is that the fee market and financial services will replace the mining income by then.
But once the limit is reached there will never be any new bitcoins created. 
It's also theorized that in the future it will be profitable to use things like quantum computers to break old wallets. At that point active wallets are expected to have moved to more secure cryptos.

Your coin will exist on all chains that fork out of bitcoin. As long as you hodl you cannot lose any coin.

The fact that everyone is entitled to their opinions does not mean that every opinion has worth. I'm pretty sure that my political opinion is quite a ways off from the standard American view of liberal.
The deluded part is quite easy. 
You see "taxation is theft" isn't logically consistent. In order for theft to exist you need a legal framework. In order for property to exist you also need a legal framework. If you have laws you have a state. 
Without laws you don't own, you have. Without laws you don't steal, you take. There is no natural law of ownership.
So if you accept that you have a state and that state uses taxation to run social services then it can't be theft since theft is defined by the states laws.
You might feel that tax is morally wrong for some weird reason but it still isn't theft.
Also I assume that in your optimal tax-less society you would leave public education in massive debt. Heck you would be born in debt because natal care isn't cheap. And I guess the fire department and the police department should send a bill as well?
Unless of course you believe that there are holy laws given to us by a higher being or other such nonsense in which case my "deluded" comment still stands.

Nah I dabble in stocks and such and as long as my broker does his job it's a one-click thing as well. If I were a "certified" investor or similar it would take some work for sure.
Also as far as I see it taxes are the most important thing in any national state. Without funds the state is powerless. Paying taxes is a constant interaction between state and citizen. So a convoluted, unfair, obfuscated tax system will degrade people's trust in the state and without that trust corruption grows. And once the corruption is high enough the state basically doesn't work any more. 
The US have companies paying negative tax, you spend tax dollars on the military like crazy but paying for everyone's health care is too expensive. The infrastructure is crumbling and any large government project is often a straight up money grab by the "winning" corporations due to them having written both sides of the law/contracts.
The lack of transparency starts at the price tags on your groceries and goes all the way to your presidents text returns. In my country every persons tax returns are public, published information. Every government tender is done in the open (except some military spending of course). We also have a central statistics office that freely publishes almost any imaginable data for free.

Looking for reason in small time frame movement of the price will drive you mad. The price is a function of thousands of humans and algorithms all trying to maximize profits or further an individual agenda. 
Bitcoin price can't be predicted. 
Imagine that you had a foolproof method of predicting bitcoin price. As you act on your predictions to maximize profit you will,by your own actions, influence the price. The more you earn the more the price is influenced. Suddenly your prediction model has to perfectly model your own actions as you use the model. This isn't possible. Now imagine if multiple people have the same method and the method quickly stops working.
The end result is that there can never be any algorithm to accurately predict a system like bitcoin and small variations in any number of parameters can have wide spread effects on the system/price.
The answer to any questions regarding the why of a sudden price change is impossible to know for certain and those who answer with certainty are either stupid or pushing an agenda.

There aren't enough gpus in the world to compete with bitcoin and the power usage would be stupid. There are hashing algorithms designed to be asic resistant. There are algos built to run better on CPUs. There are even algorithms that use hard drive space as the determining factor.

Living in a first world country is a privilege. You automatically have easy access to a lot of things most humans can only dream of. You have no say in  the reception of these privileges so in some ways they are forced upon you. Some privileges you can opt-out of but some you can't realistically. They are still privileges and if you don't want to pay for them then as I see it you should be morally obliged to pay the state back and go live somewhere without a working state, say Somalia or perhaps some desert in Syria.
Taxes don't belong to you. They are the property of your state. The state isn't separate from the citizenry. You are a part of your state. Look out your window and compare it to images from Somalia. I'd say the difference is worth a few percent of your earnings.

Super computers are either general purpose or extremely specialist. The general purpose ones are useless for hashing and the specialist ones are even more useless unless you have a supercomputer specializing in highly parallel hashing. But in that case it isn't called a supercomputer it's called a mining farm.
It's quite easy. If it was possible to build computers better at mining bitcoin then miners would already be building them. No supercomputer in the world can hold a candle to the best mining hardware. A warehouse in Asia can outperform every supercomputer in the world if all they were doing was hashing nonces.

It isn't trivial to stop this but building that large amount of chips without it leaking isn't really realistic. If it became obvious that a state was doing this bitcoin could hard fork to another algorithm or similar which would make the entire thing a massive massive waste of money. Of course this would greatly harm miners as well so the possibility of getting the fork through would be difficult.
But the result of this attack would only be in effect for as long as the state actor kept the ASICS running. As soon as they stop, bitcoin would begin to run normally again albeit slow due to difficulty being raised. 
Currently the bitcoin network uses 40ish TWh per year so 110GWh per day.
The attacker needs to have around 51% so that's something like 115GWh per day. Electricity prices in say the US are at 0.13 per kWh. 
So 15 million in just electricity, per day, to run your attack. Of course a state could get some rebates but there are very few places that actually have 115GWh of spare capacity just laying around. So you would have to distribute the attack which would increase the likelihood of leaks.

How does a western government ban mining? What specific thing are they going to ban? Hashing? Specialized ASICs? Excessive power usage? Because each of these things are used by many different non-cryptocurrency processes.
China can ban mining since the state has far reaching powers but in the western world? I don't really see how that's going to happen. 
Banning holding and transmission of cryptocurrency is also more or less impossible since cryptography is a lot stronger than laws. You can push it a bit underground but bitcoin in particular is built to work in adversarial conditions.
The only practical attack is to go after the fiat contact points and that will harm bitcoin in the short run but over time it will swing back and you will get a dark economy with no legal insight at all instead. Keeping bitcoin and crypto legal is the only way to stop it becoming the de facto black market currency of the world.
Realistically a large government could harm any cryptocurrency with a concentrated and costly effort. The less robust ones could possibly be killed outright. The cryptos with public figureheads would be easiest to hurt. But as long as there's a single node left it can alway be restarted.

Every modern wallet can do a 25th word system. That means that any 24word wallet can have infinite amounts of secret subwallets depending on the 25th word. So you can have a secret 25 word wallet on a regular 24 word seed while still having funds on the 24 word seed.
Then you can generate an xPub key on the plain 24 word seed that you can import into some wallet software to keep track,possibly with alerts. If your canary/spending wallet has unsanctioned transactions then it's time to move the hidden wallet as quick as possible.
Also the 25th word should be a strong password

* block A is mined and all is well
* UASF is invoked at August 1st 
* block B is mined by a segwit flagging node. All is well 
* block C is mined by a non flagger. UASF doesn't "see" it.
* block D is mined by non flagger. UASF doesn't react 
* block C' is mined by a UASF miner. All UASF nodes rejoice. Everyone else rejects block because D is the latest block.
* Block E is mined by a segwit flagging non UASF node. UASF doesn't care because D' is the next block so it's discarded.
* chain is split.
Unless UASF + segwit have more than 50%+ the chain is fucked.

It seems to me that you have some serious misunderstandings here. 
A node used to mean a miner as per the white paper. Once mining got specialized we separated nodes and miners. Nowdays a node is a peer in the bitcoin network that has a copy of the blockchain and that relays bitcoin messages. While it's useful for a wallet to also be a node it isn't strictly necessary. My trezor isn't a node, most normal thin wallets are not nodes. A node doesn't sign transactions and doesn't collect fees. A node is not an economic actor.
If enough miners HF there can be no economic activity on the remaining chain as there will be no blocks. Without new blocks there are no transactions. Businesses will absolutely go with the chain where transactions are possible, that will be the largest chain I'm terms of hash rate nothing else. Most businesses are more concerned with transactions than moral purity. They will follow the longest chain, just as the protocol creators intended.
I'm very much pro segwit but I'm not deluding myself that we can make our own chain with blackjack and hookers without catastrophic consequences.

Absolutely. I have converted bitcoin to my country's currency several times and I have paid taxes on the gains. I have been in contact with my country's revenue service to ensure that I followed proper procedure.
If I exchange my country's currency for USD and then upon changing back I have more of my own currency then that is a capital gains that I should pay taxes on. Same for bitcoin. 
I have enjoyed free education, free health care, subsidized infrastructure and some truly magnificent child benefits from my state so not paying my taxes feels like an epic dick move.

This means the electrum software is now able to detect that a fork has taken place and can insure that you don't spend your coins on both chains. Directly after a fork your transaction is valid on both chains. If the chains never "merge" you might end up sending more than you intended or perhaps even send funds that the receiver won't see.
When BIP148 activates part of the network will stop listening to those parts that don't flag for segwit. Unless a majority of miners flag segwit the chain will split. The legacy chain will be longer but BIP148 nodes, users and wallets won't see it. In normal operation a wallet or node will always follow the longest chain. It's a major part of how bitcoin works.
BIP148 or UASF hopes that the lockout will force miners to flag segwit in order to stay in the commercial network. But there is a possibility that the UASF  will create a split network where all transactions in the UASF chain will take days causing an abandonment. This would be a disaster as every coin spent on the UASF chain would suddenly be invalid or worthless.
PROTIP: If UASF gains traction but not more than 51% traction then hold on to your coins. Sending funds might become a massive hassle and lost transactions are likely.

It isn't hyperbole. Of course there are other devs that could produce quality bitcoin code, no doubt. But to develop an existing system takes experience not raw skills. My comments was that in the allotted time frame it would be close to impossible for the people with actual experience to make a safe tested release. For a few people who haven't been involved lately it's absolutely impossible. Some corners will be cut, some things won't be tested or documented enough and we will likely have network destroying bugs.
You say that they were invited. I've read that the invitation was a sham. Core devs are not a homogeneous group. Some core devs tried to join the mailing lists and such but we're thrown out. 
The code wasn't on github when I made my comment. It's impossible for me to forsee the future.
You should really try to assume good faith when arguing on the internet. Unless you're purposefully trying to stir things up.
No one I  their right mind would bet a billion dollar system on untested code. No one who subscribes to the basic principles of bitcoin would run protocol changing code written in secret and controlled by a few special interests. Its possible that core is in the wrong here but an alternative that is less open is a step in the wrong direction.

You don't have to publish your IP to mine. As it is a peer-to-peer you only need a couple of nodes that know who you are for you to be able to mine. At the basic level you can't ddos a miner because there is no attack surface because you can't find his IP. 
Now in modern mining there are some public services that do have IPs that you can attack. But mining as a basic activity is not very susceptible to ddos. You can somewhat damage miners but they can hide much better than you can attack if they need to.

There are two type of speculative positions to take. A short means that you bet on the asset going down and a long is that you bet on the asset going up. 
Now you can use leverage for this ie you you bet twice your money on it going up or down. If you have a short position and the price goes up you need to have enough money on your brokerage account to cover your possible losses. If the price goes up enough that you can't cover the losses you end up in a squeeze and have to liquidate your holdings to cover the bill.
If many people are squeezed at the same time they all have to buy back the asset and that causes the price to skyrocket.
Technically a short is you borrowing coin and immediately sell it for dollars because you expect the coins value to drop so you can buy back at a lower price and keep the difference. But the broker expects that you have enough money on hand to buy back the amount of coins that you borrowed.
A standard long is just buying the asset and hope it goes up. But a leveraged long means that you have borrowed money to buy coin.

you are missing things. 
If the BIP148 side lacks miners it might never actually get to the segwit activation point. It could take years and no one is going to wait several days per block.
The profit increase for segwit is low right now. Many miners belive that larger blocks are a better way to higher profits. Many miners don't want a malleability fix as they belive it will lose them money. All these reasons might prevent them from going segwit. It isn't black and white here. The choice isn't no segwit vs segwit because that's an easy choice. The choice is segwit vs big blocks and that is not clear cut. 
Also segwit requires action. Staying on legacy doesn't require action. There are always actors that stay on the easy path not the profitable path.
All of this combines into a picture that isn't at all as clear cut as you would like to belive. If the discrepancy in block size is to big between the BIP148 -&gt; segwit and the non BIP148 then miners would lose out on all the fees they have already mined on the legacy chain.
A direct switch to segwit at 80% signaling as originally stated would absolutely "force" everyone over to segwit. UASF is an aggressive patch that either forces segwit lock-in or splits the chain forever. Both are possible. Right now though it seems like miners will flag for segwit to prevent the split. Although they will likely flag using the segwit2x software that also lock-in a hard-fork to larger blocks in the near future. Which might fuck our shit up once more.

no this is truth. Mining is the engine that drives the network. If you remove the engine it doesn't matter how awesome your car is it just won't run. Unless the UASF manages to sway more than say 50% of the mining capability there will be massive complications. Businesses and users will stay in the car that has a working engine not the car that morally perfect.
The absolute worst case would be something like a 50/50 split as that would let both cars continue with half an engine each causing a permanent split that will more or less ruin bitcoin as we know it.

I don't understand your logic here.
* step one is not a given. It's obviously debated all the time.
* why would miners follow the bip blocks? They have to actively upgrade to do that right?
* unless bip148 has more than 50% of the hashing power then the bip148 blocks would be orphaned and discarded?
Your arguments don't make sense. Segwit won't be activated by August the 1st according to BIP148 nodes will discard non segwit signalling blocks in order to activate Segwit after the set period. Just because you blindfold your client doesn't mean the miners have to care. As long as there is any exchanges left on the non-bip148 the miners will be satisfied.
I feel that your arguments are deeply flawed but feel free to correct me as it might be I who lack understanding here.

Nope, but there are other coins to mine and the boost in eth &amp; friends lately have made it possible to recouping an investment into a small home gpu-farm in a few months. This has led to a massive shortage of the best hash/watt GPUs.
This is of course related to bitcoin as most cryptocurrencies are valued against bitcoin and follow bitcoins rise and fall.

Bitcoin is always risky. I'd really rather have this much of my investments in something more stable but the increase in value of the cryptocurrencies means that I'm loathe to cash out.
Now if there is a risk of a split I expect the value of the surviving chains to fluctuate wildly and possibly even crash. Difficulties will be wildly unproportional and a lot of the ecosystem will have issues (replay attacks and such). The effective usefulness of bitcoin A and B will be close to zero for possibly weeks.
This is not a medium where I want to keep a lot of my net worth. As such I will absolutely cash out before a split and I might not even return. Bitcoin was supposed to be a decentralized dependable transaction and value storage medium and a split like this will more or less betray all of the core principles. If bitcoin stops being a movement and just becomes another "stock" then I'd rather just keep my money elsewhere even if it means that I will profit less from it.
I also won't move into another cryptocurrency because the current bitcoin issues are a function of being the largest and that will probably repeat itself when the descendant of bitcoin reaches majority.
In short my cashing out might mean I lose lot of value but at least I won't lose all of it. Also I have a house to buy.

BIP48 blocks would be built upon the last BIP48 block not the blocks that BIP48 clients no longer sees. If the BIP48 chain is shorter, which it might very well be, then the rest of the network will discard the BIP48 blocks. It will discard them as the chain is an orphan chain according to the rest of the network.
In a regular self-serving network the miners would have started signaling for segwit a long time ago. The fact that they aren't proves more or less that their value function contains other criteria than those you stated.
Put simply, many miners feel that SW blocks are not worth it on a political level and as such overrules their interest on a fee-level. Also fees are still a very small part of miner profit.
The miner majority isn't signalling segwit. If BIP48 excludes a majority of miners then BIP48-bitcoin is dead in the water and the big blockers have won. It's a terrible gamble.

Safest: order hardware wallet, initialize wallet, send coins to wallet.
Fastest: use a well renowned phone app and set up a wallet. Send coins to wallet.

Always keep a physical backup of your keys, preferably keywords. Never store keys on any cloud backup system. Use a reasonable fee when sending or you coins could take many hours to transfer.
My advice: Get a trezor. They're small, cheap, usable and very safe. Also many exchanges can use the trezor api directly which increases security as trezor is designed to work with untrusted computers. Keys never leave the trezor and you always see the correct information in the display.

A seed phrase is just a human readable way to represent a bitcoin heuristic wallet key. The seed doesn't "unlock" the wallet, the seed **is** the wallet. So any wallet software or hardware that understand that protocol can access the wallet.
The amount of possible combinations of the words is so ridiculously large that even if you used every computer in existence to calculate nothing but keys you still wouldn't get a "collision" until the heat death of the universe.
Every seed is able to generate an infinite number of addresses but this is done in a completely deterministic way. This means that your wallets adresses can always be calculated once you have the seed.

No segwit2x won't disable asicboost as there will be no incentives to mine segwit blocks. The point is to get everyone over to segwit with the discount of segwit block memory as the lure. Then the blocksize can be modified if needed.
UASF is a dangerous hack. But sadly it might be our best bet out of this mess.

If it is it would have already crippled the network. That bitcoin still lives is proof that a ddos doesn't work. You can't ddos a massively distributed network with more bandwidth than you.

A government don't actually need complete control over its money to function. In fact the whole point of federal banking was to remove some control over money from the elected government.
If you boil it down a government is way to distribute shared resources, usually via the collection and spending of tax. It's completely possible to tax bitcoin. Sure bitcoin itself can be made hard to track but people are still quite easy to. Income tax, VAT and so on are still possible with bitcoin.
A government run on bitcoin would in my opinion be better since it can't use its control over money to rob its citizens and all of its finances could be made completely public as it should be. The very best way to make sure the government works for the people is for the people to be able to see the money.

Miners have dedicated links to other miners. If you try to ddos their public points you're effectively only locking yourself out of the network. Once you can no longer afford your ddos your chain will be shorter and will discarded. Ddos is a problem for sure but you will be hurting yourself more.

Yes, moving coin in is one usage. But securities and other usages seems to pretty much imply that you are dealing with tokens created out of thin air. 
Also since the bitcoin protocol doesn't have a 2way pegging mechanism every sidechain is a trustfull system. So I really don't see the point here. We already have plenty of trustfull securities issuers and exchanges.

I'm not saying that but without an engine you don't move forward. You can move without a roof or a windscreen or with hung gears. When choosing which vehicle to use we tend to go with the one that moves. 
Exchanges, businesses and wallets don't actually work without a block every reasonable time frame.

Wouldn't this create a system where miners jump between chains to mine the one with the lowest difficulty?
I just fail to see how UASF will be successful when the network more or less is built to discard shorter chains. I  also don't see any reason why miners would hide their intentions. Stability is key for miners so being coy about what side to join helps absolutely nobody, not even themselves.

Good response but as always when writing about open source using Linux is a bad example. Linus runs Linux, what he says is Linux will always be Linux, there is no democratic structure. People can fork his work as much as they like but it will no longer be Linux. Most other large open source projects has a more "council of elders" type of leadership.

Not quite. There are at least 3 diffrent cryptocurrency ASIC types on the market. So you need one megafarm for each type as well as a general purpose one. And then there's proof of stake and federated trusted peer models as well.

NK are absolutely hoarding cryptocurrencies, there's no doubt about it. NK desperately need international currencies to support their Grey market purchasing of weapons and luxury items for their leaders. Heck they send their own people to be slave labor in Russia and China to get some currency, of course they're going to try to get crypto as well.

If a single person controlled more than 50% of the hash power then this argument would simply not exist. At above 50 you can implement any changes you want and everyone will follow. This isn't the case here.

You do realize that the large mining pools and the Bitcoin developers have changed the protocol before when problems arose right? Just because its decentralized doesn't mean its anarchy. It's in the large miners and the developers interest to keep the network working smoothly so as we come upon snags they get ironed out as long as 51% of the miners agree to change

Also most sites have methods for resetting or removing your 2FA but it often requires human intervention and, more importantly, wait periods of a couple of days. That means the legitimate account holder has some time to react before the account is stolen.
