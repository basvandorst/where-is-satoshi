OP is giving away bitcoin. (I'm not OP) 150 bits @_date: 2014-09-16 00:21:19
lol! Just wondering where it's actually being used because while bitcoin is supposed be about a borderless currency, most have to cash out. I believe remittances will be a big part of bitcoin but it's not yet because there isn't infrastructure to convert to the local currency.
If you don't want to say, that's perfectly fine.

1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin. So 0.001 bitcoins should be 1000 bits if my decimals aren't wrong.

But wouldn't those that hoard eventually have to realize those gains? The reason people spend bitcoin is because they want the product now. Why buy a computer now when you can buy a better one later? Same with a new car.
For the first image in your article, I think deflation is a benefit to society. Eventually, the value of bitcoin will stabilize and gradually increase in value (a few percent a year due to a productive society).
The article you linked to links to the paper below shows that people are using bitcoins (on page 3). The 64% include addresses from the beginning of bitcoin where people lost the hard drives or usb sticks with the thousand of btc on them. Many of the original will never be moved.
Whatever happens, cryptocurrencies are not going away. And many of us are betting that bitcoin is going to be the one that changes the world.

But every time there's a 'bitcoin's dead' media frenzy, more people get exposed to bitcoin. People will think "Wait didn't it die before? It's still around and worth even more?"
The people who read about the price crash (even the negative, 'I told you so' group) will remember the price and see that it hits a new ATH and they will want in. Many will get burned in the next crash but some will stay. And that's how I believe bitcoin will grow.

I'm talking about if bitcoin is adopted as a world wide currency. Once it's adopted by the world, bitcoin's value can only go up by creating value through efficiency increase or inventions (or crash if a flaw is found in bitcoin). We would be at the very end of the adoption curve at the point I'm talking about where growth will only be a few percent a year.

But that $500 billion figure is the amount sent, right? So let's say the cost of fees is about 12% from the video which equals to $60 billion. Since bitcoin has much smaller fees, say 1% of $500 billion, it would be $5 billion. This is assuming the amount of remittances stays the same.
Am I wrong in this guesswork? A lot of people are talking like $500 billion is going to go into bitcoin. Maybe I'm looking at this all wrong.

You also have to keep in mind that they are in competition with each other. Bitcoin will get to a point where everyone's heard about it but don't know much. A TV media outlet will eventually want to profit on it to 'cash in' the viewers. Then the price will skyrocket causing another bubble. 
Just a guess.

Because bitcoin is new, no one knows how to categorize it. It's both a store of value like gold, and currency like dollars. I'd say right now it's treated a like a commodity due to its exposure. If you're going to speculate, but also want to support the bitcoin economy, have your investment and then replenish what you spend in bitcoins. Before you buy something, see if you can buy it in bitcoins first.

What bitcoin has is the network effect. It has more value because more people are using it. You could start up your own currency based on bitcoin (because it's open source), but why would anyone use it? Kinda like how Windows is so dominant today. Lots of people use Windows which leads to software for Windows which leads to more people using Windows. You could use Litecoins, Namecoins, Terracoins etc. but they don't have nearly as much following as bitcoin. Bitcoin can be replaced by another cryptocurrency but it will have to have significant advantages.

That's not any different from bitcoin. If bitcoin gets more valuable, more people will spend money to mine, which eventually increases the difficulty. Just like how oil/gold was cheaper when it was easier. Now the easy oil is gone so it's now worthwhile to go after the harder stuff. How is limiting scarcity bad? It's good because it increases value like we're seeing right now (although a big part of it is hype). If you could still get 1000 bitcoins from mining a day it wouldn't be worth $100+ right now.


I disagree. Maybe the growth through inflation is artificial growth. All these economic downturns happened because people were using money worth nothing. But this is where it all gets theoretical and I'm not so sure I buy into Keynesian economics. I used to think "printing more money will spur economy,"  but not so much anymore.

Shows the richest wallets. The largest wallet has 111,111 bitcoins which is $15,777,762 at $142. If each bitcoin was worth $5000 that's $555,555,000. Take 5 million bitcoins at $5000 and that's $25 billion. There are many more people who are much richer than that. They still can't control the network by owning that many bitcoins. Sure they can crash the market (for whatever reason, not sure why as they would lose the most) but bitcoin won't die out. You (we) are supporting much worse criminals in fiat, imo.

Bitcoin will get close to an equilibrium point where its value of growth will only be a few percent a year. I don't know how many years that will take, but investors will still invest in new startups. There are people creating startups right now even though risk is extremely high. That's why I'm spending what I can to help the bitcoin economy.


I believe this is how it is right now. The government prints money from nothing to lend. Who does it go to? Banks who lend it out to people at a higher interest rate. When the government prints money, it lowers the value of all the dollars that currently exist. We're always playing catch up to the devaluation of the dollar. That's why employees always need a raise to simply buy what they could before. With bitcoin, we can save a small amount at a time and it won't lose value over time. I used to think that inflation was a good thing. Now I don't.
1) It encourages people to invest/spend.
2) With deflation, the economy will grind to a halt.
With point 1, there will always be investors if there are chances of making more money rather than holding. You see people investing in ASIC company shares because there is a chance for earning more bitcoins. Super high risk, super high reward. I think investing in bitcoin startups will encourage more wise investing as the business would have to do better than the value growth of bitcoin.
On point 2, deflation used to be a problem because no government ever decided to print lower value denominations. If one cent could buy a car, you won't spend it on an apple and the economy will stop moving. Bitcoin solves this problem because you can always divide it. Before, two pizzas cost 10,000 bitcoins. Now you can spend 0.20 bitcoins. In the future it might cost 0.002 bitcoins.
Before I got into bitcoin because it is something brand new. Now I think it's partly something of a movement where it takes away some of the power the rich have over the poor. I'm not extreme to the point where I say we need no government as others do and to be honest, I think that kind of view scares people away from bitcoin.
This came out a lot longer than I intended. I hope I explained it okay. I'm still in the process of figuring it out, too.
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:22:44
Instead of bitcoin (your oil), people can begin to support other cryptocurrencies (alternate energies).
No one wants to lower the price of bitcoin. That's a feature. Just like gold. Why would people not invest if they can make more money than just by saving it? Only the rich make tons of money off of stock and investments. I guarantee you they will still invest in new ventures. Regular people just hope it does better than fiat in the long run. Do you think the rich will live frugally to gain 5% per year to deflation? I don't. 
Let's say it's a deflationary economy. I think it's better to have solutions to foster investing. It could be incentives to invest (although I think it's better to just directly give incentives to business starters instead of giving it to banks to invest like what happened to student loans). Frankly, our economy now is a deflationary situation because so many people are in debt. This indebted society causes people to stop spending because they have to pay back debts. Many people are graduating with thousands in debt and then can't find a decent job and then have to work paying off this unforgivable debt for a large part of their lives. Sure, initially debt spurred growth, but now there's too much debt. You'll say print more money. Where does it go? Not into the common people's pockets, that's for sure. I would like to try something different for a change. Maybe a deflationary currency with some modifications will work better than inflationary with modifications. What's new with bitcoin is that because it's infinitely divisible, deflation can go on forever, so you can always charge less which means the economy won't come to a complete stop. It's what makes bitcoin special. I don't it's late; I think I rambled too much.
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:52:01

It would depend on how much he's going to accept in deciding how many confirmations you want to wait for. Coffee priced stuff, zero confirmation is fine. The general consensus is 6 confirmations for large sums. If you want to immediately convert the bitcoins to fiat, then you can use coinbase or bitpay. Then all of the bitcoin volatility risk is on the payment processors.

Once bitcoin stabilizes (I'm talking years or decades later), when bitcoin only appreciates a few percent a year, it'll be used like fiat right now. I don't believe in the deflationary spiral because bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Having an item now provides more worth to you than what bitcoin appreciates in a year so you'll buy it. I could be completely wrong, so I encourage people to post more opinions.

@_date: 2013-04-06 23:22:24
Yeah, they can which is why I included an imaginary person with 5 million bitcoins. 10 million bitcoins (out of the 11 millioin btc available today - 90%) would be $50 billion at $5000. That's only the 5th richest on the forbes list. And if bitcoins get so widespread were each bitcoin is worth $5k, I'm willing to bet the rich will want a piece of the bitcoin pie.
I'm in bitcoin because it's something new and revolutionary. It might not be bitcoin that succeeds but cryptocurrencies aren't going away in my opinion. 
This is all hypothetical so just get as many bitcoins as you're comfortable with. Any people with bitcoins now would be considered early adopters.

I think my explanation was bad. I meant it as spending bitcoins on an online store. PotatoBadger said many try to go to local places that accept bitcoin. If the Portland meetup group isn't meeting at bitcoin accepting restaurants they really should! Having a 'bit mob' on top of that would be even better.

I'm not. If I don't feel like reading about bitcoin, I don't come to this sub or any other site. Just check the price when I'm bored. Not sure what drama you're talking about.
I mean, no one forced you to use bitcoin and taxes aren't really bitcoin's fault...
I hope you didn't put in more than you can lose if you're in the red and don't want to cash out.

After you put in the private key into blockchain.info's wallet, are you supposed to create another new paper wallet to keep the remainder of the unspent bitcoins? Since the private key was exposed to blockchain.info?
edit: I ask because there was a post of someone losing all their bitcoins because they made a mistake after spending some. I don't even know what went wrong in that post.

I don't really see a market for it as the current demographic of bitcoin is relatively tech-savvy people. That doesn't mean they aren't interested in antique books, just that chances are low. I don't see how it could hurt to accept bitcoin. I don't think you can accept bitcoins on ebay but you can post some on [Bitmit]( and see what happens. FAQ says 1.90% for every sale. May be worth a shot. Good luck.

I think it's something we all already are well aware of. The upside is that we are seeing more and more places accept it (why shouldn't they?). The problem is that these kinds of posts are going to keep popping up until you can buy groceries, Amazon accepting it, and Bank of America offering insured bitcoin deposits all at the same time.


I really do like that quote. That paragraph shows it's not just price hype. Now it's beginning to be what bitcoin can do and how it might fit into our society. Even if it lacks depth, it's a better direction.
Either way, it's creating awareness and if some multibillion dollar company decides to accept it, people won't be completely clueless and it'll be more about reassurance in bitcoin's strength.

It can be programmed that way but why would you pick up another cryptocurrency? Bitcoin was easy mining earlier because it had little value which means more risk for very early adopters. Anyone could create a cryptocurrency with inflation built in, but how is rate of inflation decided? It's not infinitely exponential though. Eventually, bitcoin will reach equilibrium to fiat and will be usable as a store of wealth and currency.
In an IPO, the initial buyers of the stock (not to mention pre-IPO stock) are able to get majority of the stock. They are taking a risk in investing in a company. Do these early [google employees]( not deserve their stock? 
I rather have new money wealth taking charge rather than old money. It would be impossible to get an equal amount of cryptocoins to everyone. Even if they did, the rich would buy up other people's coins causing uneven distribution again. I really do wish the entire human population can have their fair share. It's not fair that thousands of tons of food go to waste in the US while other parts of the world starve. The world isn't magically going to be equal for everyone. I feel like bitcoin is going in the right direction for bettering humanity, just like the internet provides easier access to information.

I don't know when you bought but you should do what most of us do; keep separate amounts for spending and investing. If you just want to use bitcoin as a currency, keep it in fiat and exchange it when you want to buy something in bitcoin. Let's be honest, the dollar is much more stable than bitcoin.

I'm just curious as to what approach people think the government will take. I know if the government takes action it will be some BS reason. Cash can fund all those things. I know the media will paint a very dirty picture of bitcoin. To ban bitcoin, I'd think a lot of other things will have to go too.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:26:46
I have to say, when the whole of society seems to blame you for things out of your control, using bitcoins feels like a taste of true freedom. I also have the hope of bitcoin making a difference, but we should be careful not to be blinded by bitcoin's potential. $2k to $2 million would have been nice, for sure.

You sound like you're from r/conspiracy.
I wouldn't be surprised if the government doesn't already track addresses to people if you gave up that info at an exchange, me included. Fack.
I guess mixers would be banned in your scenario.
If all bitcoins are registered, I'll just use an altcoin. Clean bitcoins to something (gold?) to altcoin to whatever banned, illegitimate thing.
I don't know, maybe I'm not really seeing the issue.
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:35:23
What I think will happen is that once PayPal accepts bitcoins, their fees would have to be 0.99% or less to compete with BitPay. Since fees are much lower, merchants will want customers to use bitcoin. Maybe offer discounts to use bitcoin (like how many places offer rewards for using their credit card). If PayPal muscles everyone out of bitcoin payment processing, (of BTC to USD) merchants can accept bitcoin directly. It might be a hassle, but I'm willing to bet some merchants will. I guess it depends on how long competitors to Paypal will stick around. What do you think of this scenario?

But at what cost? In China, the little guys are screwed over due to little to no regulation or bribes. 
I'm just not entirely convinced the free market can/will solve  all the problems out there. I highly doubt the internet would have been created without government funding. I feel like once the big companies are established, they will do everything in their power to crush competition. It might be bad now, but I think it would be even worse without some kind of regulation.

Because you want/need that thing now. You could put off buying a new car or a new computer and get a better one next year. 
You're using bitcoin as an investment and that's perfectly fine, but why not both? Have a savings fund and a spending fund which you replenish so you help the bitcoin economy more.
One thing I was surprised about is that you won't regret spending it. I don't find myself thinking, "Damn if I waited for another week, I would have saved $5!" I'm actually at the point where I'm actively looking to spend at merchants that decided to accept bitcoins.

How about commodities like oil or gold? Some parts of the world have oil being used to help society (and its citizens), but in most of the world, only a select few own oil and whoever owned the land with oil made bank. Whoever rushed to gold first got the most.

Gold bugs seem to think gold and other metals are safe. The government already confiscated gold once (Executive Order 6102). Or the Gold Reserve Act a year later.
