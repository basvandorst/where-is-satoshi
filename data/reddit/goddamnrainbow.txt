Idk what employers you are used to but most people cannot get paid in any other way than to a bank account.

I'm going to study in Poland for a few months and I'm taking morning after pills with me. If I get raped in Poland on Friday evening I have to wait till Monday morning to get a doctor's prescription to get a MORNING AFTER pill. All hail PiS.

If you want the church to run the country, then yes Poland is the place to be right now. If you care about women's health, everyone's safe sexuality and any traces of trias politica, run.
There are other ways to ban immigrants than getting these weirdo's running the country. I also dare to bet my life on that an average Polish man beats his wife more often than an average refugee does.

I actually needed an extra verification step. Coinbase wanted my ID card, GDAX insisted I add another card for verification..

If you can lose 10k and don't care, you are in a quite luxurious position already.

It'd be lovely if you don't give the media even more reasons to shit on cryptocurencies in general
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:05:35
I have a coworker who keeps asking how my coins are doing and keeps telling me how hard she'll laugh once it collapses. Apart from whether you believe in bitcoin or not, it's such a useless remark. Like, you just gonna tell people you hope they lose money because they are trying a new thing? What kind of person does that make you?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:55
It's not, it's just a modern Johnny Depp movie like Alice in Wonderland. The message is different, there is more story and it's creepy in its own awesome way.
It doesn't hurt to watch remakes if you're able to watch them as a standalone thing.

I'm reading the website and smh.. One of the answers in the Q&amp;A translates to:
"No, virtual "money" is not created nor backed up by the national central bank or the country, it is not money. Meaning they are not a lawful payment method, nor money, nor can they be used to pay taxes nor do they fulfill the criteria of being generally accepted in points of trade/service."
Wanna bet

To poor people? I wanted to send from GDAX to Bitfinex to get into IOTA. Did a small amount because it was the first time I sent a cryptocurrency to a different account. My saldo on there now is -8 bucks, lost my coins, and not too eager to try again until I have hundreds to spare.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:44:01
The point of Bitcoin in the end, once it's adopted by a big amount of people, is that you won't need to cash out. Right now all you need to do is buy some cryptocurrency at an exchange and proceed to pay directly to the company you want to get services from. Have a list of places you can throw your crypto at, without the need of a regulating/government middleman: 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:42:22
I'll hug you while throwing more money at it
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:48:02
Good for you. Do you also have a huge debt you can pay off and with that let go of something that's constantly weighing down on you?

There's a difference between being aware and being active at all. I was aware since 2013 and invested last week.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:26:25
If you want bitcoin to become a mainstream currency, you're in for a life of being very sick
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:37:20
And it doesn't have to be anonymous. It's about the option to remove the middle man.

I wanted to post that second sentence. Taking financial advice, or any  advice for that matter, from someone who spends their time watching The Real Housewives? No, thank you, I'll pass.

Even coinbase fees are not TOO ridiculous, looking at how much bitcoin you can gain after a while
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:58:07
I am one of those people and yes, it sucks. A lot. We are at a loss with some hopes it will go up. If it doesn't, I'll just distract myself with the succesful life of my Sims.

You must be such a nice person to be around, especially when trying to learn new things.

I had my sleep schedule on point after years of struggling with it. Then cryptocurrency happened..
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:05:11
Actually, I am not sure. If we casually say it's 17.1 instead of 17.1k it may seem like we talk about thousands as if they are nothing. As if you need to regard thousands of euro's as something dismissible.

Wanna bet? I bought last week because I've been the biggest idiot on this planet for 4 years of knowing about Bitcoin and not doing shit. I'm here to stay and pump in more 'till I'm rich af.

As a person who jumped on the hype at literally the peak I am excited to say that I waited 18 months for this to happen. Of course did some dca but mentally the ath will feel like sweet release of past mistakes ��

So literally every student for 20 years after graduation?

I'm glad your life is the way it is and you have the luxury to have that definition of rich.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:48:42
You weren't legally allowed to enter a stock market as a minor, so did you work your ass off as a kid or did you get born into a rich fam?

Edit 1.5: Discovering Bitcoin while browsing 4chan as a pre-teen doesn't make someone an expert trader
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:46:42
I just had a thought. If Bitcoin supply is limited, isn't it possible that like 100 whales can eventually buy literally all existing coins?
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:11:02
Accept the loss and just chill. I overinvested badly at the worst possible moments. Worked and lived my way through it and am now comfortable without the money even if bitcoin drops to zero.
Sit back and enjoy. If it crashes remember it's just money, if it reaches full adaptation then it's money, if it ever moons it'll be a lot of money.
+ If you're cashing out with a loss, does it make a big difference in your life whether you cash out now or when it drops even more?
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:30:03
Hell naw! I made it a point of honor to not cash out a loss. By the time we get back to break-even, I'll be too scared to sell because "what if we reach mars tomorrow". So I'm likely to just stick around forever.

And if the ruling party stays we'll get kicked out of the EU before the Euro can happen

I live in the Netherlands and am a strong supporter of the European Union, whether it's financial, politics, military or social. I'm on an Erasmus exchange to Poland right this very moment, that's why I spoke in "we". The Polish government right now doesn't seem to care about cooperation with Europe whatsoever, so at least the money should stop them from leaving the EU. I'm afraid it won't.
