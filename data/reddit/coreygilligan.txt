Love seeing these kinds of adoptions, slowly but surely people will def recognize that this can be another mode of payment. I mean online purchases accept BTC nowadays, even just the other day I stumbled upon this platform which is more like a lottery/reward that lets you win unlocked tokens of top-quality projects in [their]( ecosystem at significant discounts. It's the first time I heard about MTO but they have these rules and features to make sure that when you join they enhance the chance of winning and the fairness of the competition. It's worth to check out if you have time tho, but anyways yeah glad to see the changes and that people are getting BTC.

He is talking about the blockchain and not just the BTC currency. I think most people confuse it as the platform itself when it's is just a part of something broader. We are only thinking about the short term if we just focus on BTC only there are other alt coins to look out and use moving forward. I participated in a micro token offering event by this [platform]( and somehow realize that there other tokens that have benefits (And they offer you the chance to win 50% off to purchase featured tokens too which is great) for the project and the community. Great interview, he really explains everything well.

This looks so cool! Where can I get one? I have been eyeing on collectibles these past few months so far [this]( what got me hooked, then I stumbled on your post thinking no way I'm not gonna have this! Thanks for sharing btw!

Oh so they are adopting it too, good to know some companies are beginning to open their doors to it!

This is so me especially that btc is going $6k and me smelling the bull run! I'm guilty of buying things that are in the trend and things that I want. I've been into gambling in crypto, playing blackjack and following crypto [collectibles]( that will be licensed by the guy who made Yugioh real. Goodbye to bills and other stuff, and like the picture, Hello to BTC and gaming as a whole.
