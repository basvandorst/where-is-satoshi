Yes, the rebranding takes some time and will be done all at once.

It would be very much appreciated if you could help translate Bitsquare/bisq.
We're using transifex: 
German is the only language at 100%, so there's lots of room for you to help.

Bitsquare will rebrand to bisq in the not-so-distant future.
It's a desktop client that comes with an HD wallet that allows you to trade 100+ Altcoins and fiat vs. BTC.
You make local accounts for your payment methods (fiat, btc, alts) in a matter of minutes and can start setting up or taking offers right away.
Lively markets are Monero, USD, EUR, GBP vs BTC, though markets are still thin.
Your trades happen on the blockchain which comes with the trade-off of longer trade times vs. centralized exchanges.
It's decentralized, without single-points-of-failure that could result in people stealing your money. The secure trading protocol has 3000+ trades without any coins or fiat ever lost.
There are exciting news to come, so it might just be the right time to join.
Please have a look at the [forum]( for quick help in case you get stuck.

Bitsquare users unaffected.

yeah close ;-)
we're thinking about a lobster logo :)

If only more people used it...
It works great!
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:46:41
Thanks for being awesome!

It's not a problem. The payment methods chosen are sufficiently hard to reverse that in combination with restricted incentives, it makes no sense to pull this scam on Bitsquare.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:41:28
I understand. I assume this could be quite easily implemented. You can create a [Github issue]( or let me know if you want me to post it.
This probably won't happen soon, though, as there's so much to do.

No, sorry. You can use National bank transfer, OkPay or Alipay to transfer fiat. 
Helping to translate the software would be a good way to introduce Bitsquare to a wider audience in Taiwan.

Wohoo, Spain came in second!
The race for third is on: Netherlands, Finnland and Serbia head-to-head at about ~35%

Yeah a decentralized exchange was supposed to be Bitcoin's killer app a couple of years ago. 
Bitsquare gets mostly positive feedback but participation is dissapointing. It's not just development that lacks helping hands but also trading activity. The vast majority puts convenience above privacy and security which is a little bit surprising in this community where so many have been burnt by scams.
I don't want to complain too much, though. Working on Bitsquare is still fun, reception positive and we're always looking for ways to improve the situation.

You can post offers with a % deviation from market price. 
I understand you want to only sell when the price is above £1000, so that's not possible to set up at the moment.
