Hello everyone. I am new to reddit, I am so happy that there is a bitcoin topic and glad to meet you all! Wish everyone Good Luck and profit
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:38:57
Just a rider LOL, you are so funny! Do you even make profit? Or your job, to make fun of people?! Who is laughing now? I made my profit. And I know exactly what to do next, certainly you don't!!!

Bulls want market to grow so they buy (often green candle on graphs), whereas bears want market to drop and they sell (red candles on graph)

Drawing eh, LOL you noobs make me laugh!! Still buying?

Lol, I don't need people to listen to me! I just need respect, as I respect others ("If you want to be respected, learn first to respect others!I"That meme about you guys). I know technical analysis and I work as a trader and how do u think, I can trade without technical analysis?! I was new to the site and you people laughed at me and showed disrespect, I am not here to prove anything to anybody, just wanted respectful conversation! Good Luck

Well open your eyes wider, the levels are in red, bearish targets and for bulls to buy from! Lines 10033$ 9244$ and ect! Anyway I see your position, our conversation is over. Just save this graph and use it, free for you ))

Grow hahah, you should stop analyzing! It's not yours, find something else to do in life
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:38:45
From this level 11100$ (we might touch 11600$) I'am selling BTC, with stop loss 11800$ and take profit 9300$. In the longer run, it is bearish trend and technical analysis levels show, we are going to 8650 and 8100 (long term). As we touch these levels, have to analyse again

Nothing to do with this topic, we are discussing. Wrong section

Well I am not just a rider, that what I do in free time as my hobby! My main work is a market analyst and I am a trader. I am not trying to convince anybody, everyone has their view on the market, please respect my view! Or does my view offend you, that you try to hook me?
Here is my picture, I'll be glad if you tell your view, not just trying to insult me! Cheers
