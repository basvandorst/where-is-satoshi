Is there any exchange that supports Bech32 addresses  for withdrawal?

What a weird lambo.

More or less correct. Just it's "bitcoin" not "bit" - bit is a traditional name for μBTC (microbitcoin) - 1 millionth of bitcoin, just as you guessed.
The smallest unit is satoshi: 1 μBTC is 100 satoshi.

Like... [d]( and [c]( ? Metric prefixes to the rescue !

No, Lambo.

You have to create a new wallet and enable SegWit for it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:22:14
I don't think it is possible to use a seed of a non-segwit wallet to generate a segwit wallet.

Worldwide ? You bet there are.

S2X can be replaced with BTG ! Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:20:57
The addresses are longer but are not case sensitive. They always start with **bc1**, e.g. *bc1qhkalld2vmhf9juax6qja52ksx45lrpn0mssew9*
Segwit addresses use a new Bech32 format so I don't think it's possible to generate a vanity address - at least not with the current tools.

Or μBTC (0.000001 BTC) AKA bit.
That's one cent now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:26:51
Yes, however some outdated wallets can have problems understanding Bech32 format.

Well, it is possible to split 2X and BTC...
Then you can sell 2X without worrying about replay.

You mean "hodling bitcoin", right ?

Raiffeisen group is famous for hating bitcoin.
This is what happened to the biggest bitcoin exchange in Czechia (SimpleCoin):
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:12:59
This. Unless you are short of cash there is no reason to pay with bitcoin.
