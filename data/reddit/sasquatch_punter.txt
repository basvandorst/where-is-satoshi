Ikr. What are people smoking here?
If a watermelon goes from $4 to $5 due to inflation, that's a rise in price of 25%. Doesn't mean the watermelon is in more demand or that the supply shrank, it just means the price is keeping pace with the value of the dollar.
Most people aren't going to look at BTC as a viable store of their wealth until the boom/bust cycle becomes less intimidating than that of the dollar.

Do half the people in this thread even know how bail works? Lmao Jesus Christ...
Bail is a conditional bond. You're not paying the government; you're giving them collateral that is returned once bail conditions are met. It could be a prized collection of beanie babies or a boat; ordering him to deposit Bitcoin doesn't mean anything. 
Edit: this doesn't open the floodgates for Bitcoin to be posted as bail, either. It's up to the judge's discretion, and the courts can hold that Bitcoin or other crypto until the court proceedings are finished, which could take years in some cases. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:55:45

Lmao it's still a lost opportunity. Could have sold the high and bought back low. Patience is futile when you're dealing with hugely volatile assets.

It's hilarious because the prices of goods bought with Bitcoin are determined by wages paid in fiat, taxes paid in fiat, materials bought with fiat, licenses bought with fiat, real estate bought with fiat, energy bought with fiat... 
Doesn't matter one bit that you can value a ham sandwich at 0.0003BTC or whatever. That's an utterly meaningless conversion.
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:06:47
Afaik it's the Bitcoin amount. 
Even so, court proceedings can take years, so it could moon and dive in the meantime. Not everyone's a HODLer; I know a lot of people wouldn't be comfortable putting a volatile asset in gov't custody for so long, and there's no set timeline for the final verdict. There can be delays.

It's a fact the majority of people who have technical expertise in computers are younger. Not only is it more accessible to younger demographics, it's also "vogue" and a more attractive industry than it was 20 or 30 years ago, so there are many more young people working toward a computer profession than there were previously.


No, they're considered savvy because they belong to the demographic that dominates tech adoption. I don't know too many grandparents who code (or who even have a developed understanding of email).

Large credit transactions typically require direct authorisation and trigger card lockouts, and many cc companies have accessible services that make it easy to monitor and deny charges from your smartphone. Not to mention shady vendors can be blocked from accepting credit transactions.
Compare that to Bitcoin, which doesnt require authorisation past providing your key and doesnt lock your account when trying to move large sums. This makes Bitcoin ideal for largescale fraud.
Sorry, but the fact you think having a private key to your Bitcoin is more secure than the channels protecting credit users tells me you dont really know much in this area.
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:49:16
Exactly. It's a liquid asset class, so it doesn't really matter whether you've sold or not. What matters is that you've lost more value than others who sold, and those people can always buy again.
Ergo, you've willfully taken a temporary loss unnecessarily. That's just bad risk management. If you're in it for the long haul, you're doing it wrong.
Source: got out at 19k, got back in at 6700, took a profit and still kept my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:20:02
That's where the intrinsic value argument comes into play.
Even if gold loses 99% of its value in a mining boom, it has intrinsic value that can be traded up in markets. As a manufacturing material, a low price would spur broader use in electronic manufacturing. 
Here's an example. Solar panels of the near future may well incorporate gold to improve efficiency, and if early market trends are anything to go by solar power could end up dominating the energy sector. So manufacturing developments and a low gold price could end up buoying its value. 
On the other hand, a vast majority of Bitcoin's current value is owed solely to speculative interest by institutions and retail traders. It has no intrinsic value. Take away speculation in gold and bitcoin, and the clear winner is gold.
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:12:47
It's hugely different. Don't just parrot the guy above me, think about it. 100% loss essentially means the asset has failed and is no longer traded. I guarantee gold will never reach 100% though, and I doubt Bitcoin will in the next 50 years but you never know...
As for investing in a medium of exchange? Sure, Bitcoin's the better choice. Your point being what? As a store of value: its volatility begs to differ.
And iron isn't available to trade directly. You can only buy stock in extraction companies.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:52:00
Depends on how the price/mining rewards balance out. Price needs to keep up with successive halvings, otherwise smaller miners will be forced out leaving larger miners in control of the majority of the market. If you have a few large miners dominating consensus and controlling the supply of new bitcoins, can you really call it decentralized? 
Plus this doesn't account for unforeseen circumstance. If a huge mining farm in China goes bust/catches fire/floods/etc., that could wreak havoc on the Bitcoin network. Again, not so decentralized.
I have a hard time following the argument that "Oh BTC is so decentralized, it has so much value as a medium of exchange!" Like, are you people not paying attention to the industry? Buzzwords and catchphrases fall short of describing what is actually happening.
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:38:51

3-month trend from Jan-Mar is very negative. Support is unstable, and we have institutional selloffs, declines in volume, an investigation into price manipulation and a ban on advertising on social media pushing the price down further. I think it's fair to say we haven't reached bottom, but I sold at 16k so I'm biased.
HODL if you want to. The rest of us are going to double our BTC and we'll ride past you on the next bull run.

Back-of-the-napkin and incredibly sketchy. He also forgot to mention that card and digital transactions are also becoming more commonplace with banks as well, so their consumption will likely decrease as branches and ATMs close while Bitcoin's will increase with higher load.

It's especially hard to see people who bought near the top being emotionally pulled into a long-term hold by retarded internet memes when history has shown massive pullbacks followed by big rebounds. Like, if you're such a big believer, why wouldn't you take advantage of that? Sell high, buy low.

Nobody needs Bitcoin because it's not a stable currency. People in foreign countries opt for USD and GBP because they're relatively stable currencies and are widely accepted (as a medium of exchange) for this reason.


Then, by definition, Bitcoin isn't there yet. You can believe in the future of the tech but as a currency it doesn't meet this basic criteria. Ergo, there's currently little/no advantage to using Bitcoin (as a general currency, that is).

Tell that to environmentalists. What will the cost:value ratio be in the end for Bitcoin when there are hundreds of millions of transactions happening every day? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:55:00
You can spend it on large purchases like houses and cars, but the vast majority of transactions are miniscule in comparison and require very short transaction times. The only way I see Bitcoin scaling in this area is by adoption into the credit system. There needs to be an intermediary who can guarantee trust and efficiency for retailers.

No, it isn't. Price is a factor but the network's rate of consumption isn't dependent on it. Bitcoin's energy use has risen despite the crash, and only dropped recently because the price finally dipped below big miners' profit margins.

It's not hard to avoid buying at the top. Just identify bull runs (which is easy af with crypto tbh), don't buy after +1000% and don't sell after the price stabilizes under -75% during a bear market.
It's not rocket science. Hell I play poker as a hobby and for extra income, and I have to say there's much more difficulty there than there is in timing the crypto market. If you don't know when the market's high when playing with crypto, at this stage in the game, then you're either just ignoring blatant signals or you're letting greed and fear rule your decisions.

Do you think tungsten serves the same function as gold? That's a useless analogy.

Stability is one. Many currencies also offer far better protection against *external* manipulation, which so far has been a HUGE problem with Bitcoin. A decentralized currency free from jurisdictional control is vulnerable by nature.
Edit: and free markets exist in theory, but not in practice. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:43:03
That happens when you throw money out the window. Or develop a dumb-as-shit investment strategy like HODL where you enter one of the most volatile markets in history and just pretend that playing it like a steady long-term investment is smart. 
I can't complain since I've made money off that stupidity. It's one of the easiest markets to take a profit from ATM.

Small closed-loop economies haven't really existed since antiquity (except in remote tribes), and even then tribes tended to trade with one another. 
The issue is that, as long as Bitcoin can be traded for fiat (which is what it derives its value from), wider adoption will raise the value of Bitcoin and drive mass sell-offs which will always hurt adoption. This cycle needs to be closed in order for Bitcoin to function as a currency.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:13:08
I paid with Bitcoin at a coffee shop a few months ago. It took almost 15 minutes for the transaction to clear, during which I had to wait around at the counter, and the fee was something like 50 cents. For a cup of coffee. If I had paid with a credit card, it wouldn't have cleared for a day or two but the difference is that VISA and MasterCard are reliable and trusted by retailers. They guarantee payment, which for retailers is as good as the money changing hands instantly.

Sustainability is proven. Inflation is better than deflation; this is also proven. Auditability is just a feature of blockchain; digital fiat tokens could be issued to the same effect, which is why banks are so hot for the idea.
I won't even go into how arbitrary Bitcoin is. Decentralized, unregulated, with next to no agreement on its value except in terms of fiat. Nobody has any idea how much it's actually worth because there's literally nothing backing it. You can at least draw value assumptions from the assets and GDP backing fiat.
Edit: and it's not a solved field. It never was; there's constant conjecture and debate, and that will never change.

So in a brick and mortar retail setting, how do you envisage this working? Do you think a store with high traffic will allow BTC if it creates a huge bottleneck for customers? 
Nope. The only reason there are outlets that accept it is because so few people use BTC, you can shoo them off to the side to wait for a tx to clear while your fiat customers do their thing.
Tx times should be a MAXIMUM of 20 seconds, if that. Otherwise it will only work for online purchases, which STILL clear in as little as a few seconds.

You just repeated yourself without addressing my point. Bitcoin use cases will be affected by a falling global market, as will adoption. Trying to disassociate the two is disengenuous or ignorant.
Call me names. I understood your point perfectly. I'm just saying it's bullshit. You can have the most robust and user-friendly platform for BTC transactions but if nobody uses it because they either HODL or stick with traditional fiat, use cases are moot. So are payment systems that convert BTC to fiat at the point of sale (which is very common). In those cases, BTC miners and exchanges are redundant middlemen, and this process represents the vast majority of BTC use cases in service today.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:43:54

@_date: 2018-11-21 04:10:37
Use cases are closing because people have less appetite to hold Bitcoin when the economy's down. They'll flock to a reliable fiat currency rather than hold and spend crypto. 
People here are too tech-obsessed and don't seem to appreciate psychoeconomic variables as they relate to adoption. A market downturn will inevitably affect Bitcoin, not just the price but its use in general. OP is full of shit.

This is what I keep trying to tell my one friend who's a Bitcoin fanatic. Luckily I saw the wave coming and made a good profit off the hype, but the volatility is what kills it. Basing your value on (multiple) fiat currencies makes it that much harder to find a price consensus, something that will ultimately require some kind of centralization.

To be fair a lot of the hype ignores the dilemma of evolving supply chains and increasing complexity in the marketplace. You can't just assume industries won't adapt to blockchain.
And why would financial transparency make war obsolete? Political transparency is what really matters there, and you can't have political transparency without transparent reporting. 
You need to lower your expectations a bit. A problem I see with guys like you is you don't understand how the world works. You can know everything there is to know about blockchain; that doesn't make you prophetic.

No, because it's meme-able and stupid memes are a substitute for rational thought. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:07:53
Unless it's regulated, which essentially breaks the deregulated utopia some people here want.

Are you suggesting that sustainable debt is a negative for the overall economy? Jesus Christ, take an introductory course on inflation and debt/growth.
Replace "smart phone" with anything useful (like education or a house). Tada! Your argument is now invalid.

It wasn't primarily the result of a bubble though, it was a knee-jerk reaction to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's recent growth report. Plus they have had very solid growth for years; now would be a good time to buy, if you're interested.
Why would you even compare... oh, right. This is Reddit. smh

Can't speak for anyone else, but I bought in '14 and sold last December when it hit resistance. I started browsing this sub because I expected a group of people intimate with the exchanges and the buy/sell cycle who were interested in discussing the pros/cons of Bitcoin vs fiat.
The fact that it's instead full of meme-spamming hysterics who treat the Bitcoin community like a fucking fandom instead of as a place to discuss it critically is what makes it so hateable. I can't help but play devil's advocate against spokespeople and uber fans.
Browsing this sub has been like finding out your favorite band is popular with emo kids and bronies.

You actually think it's uncontrollable? Whales manipulating the price represents private interests already controlling Bitcoin. It's about the most decentralised it will *ever* be, pending regulatory overhauls etc., and it's already failing to live up to this promise.
Edit: You can bet on there being a social attack on Bitcoin. Seriously, with no private or public institutions to scapegoat you're pretty well inviting people to target the currency itself. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:44:37
This is the single biggest reason why Bitcoin will never replace fiat.

Where does he say "this is Bitcoin" and where is BCH sold as BTC? On the website BCH is marketed as a more cost-efficient offshoot of Bitcoin; I couldn't find any evidence of him making the claim or trying to pass BCH off as BTC.
I think the outrage mostly stems from people's incredulation that Bitcoin.com was bought by a platform marketing the bcash fork as superior. That's not exactly fraudulent behaviour.
Edit: wtf is with that analogy? Gold is a clearly defined element; so is silver. Bcash and Bcoin are essentially competing currencies and can't be substituted. If I sell you Bcash, you get Bcash; if I sell you fake gold for the price of real gold, you get something other than what you paid for. They're completely different scenarios.

If USD crashes, guess what goes with it? Investment vehicles like BTC.

We're still in the dark ages. In an ideal world where foreign intelligence services weren't constantly trying to uncover our state secrets for their benefit, I'd agree with that last part. Frankly, you're an idealist; transparency is a means to protect the interests of the citizens just as much as secrecy is, and you're living in a fantasy world if you think we only need the former. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:14:20
Yeah really. This is only valid for day trading and micro swings. 
This sub isn't for trading crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:03:03
Lmao, I also remember posters spamming articles saying the price would hit 50k, 100k, etc. in a year.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:37:45
I don't doubt it will recover, but you could sure as hell do something with your money in the meantime while it dips. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:06:21
That's a horrible counter argument. What it's actually saying is that the peso is so shit that Argentinians would have done better flipping to an unstable, speculative asset in bubble territory than they would have just holding pesos.
As an investment I guess pesos are a worse investment than Bitcoin? That's about all this trash article manages to say. Without even mentioning that if we were to tally up the number of failed cryptos vs failed fiats in the last year...
I mean way to go, contrasting the number one crypto to one of the worst fiat currencies on the market. Really proves the point that Bitcoin enthusiasts are mostly braindead retards living in an echo chamber.

You're exactly what OP's talking about. 


Uh, no. This is how people get burned. The price history is a very small piece of the puzzle when investing. Look at the crypto space now, and compare the industry hype and consumer psychology from two years ago to today. People are burned out on crypto. 
And right now the price is flat. That doesn't mean we've reached bottom. Remember we were at 8k for a while too, then the price tanked 50%. Be patient.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:13:36
Oh fuck right off.
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:17:07
I sold mid-January, and my position is much better since then. I guess OP just doesn't like making money?

What's the objective reality? That the world banking system is collapsing? You know how common debt write-offs are in the world's history? The last 1000 years are littered with state-directed economic resets, and I really have no doubt it will happen again, but you have to understand the world banking system is fixed against Bitcoin. It's not a free market of currencies by any means, and most likely never will be.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:20:33
What does that have to do with Visa?
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:30:32
It's called schadenfreude. That doesn't make it a conspiracy FFS.
OP is a perfect example of the kind of absurd paranoia that draws trolls and skeptics in the first place. This place isn't a safe space for crypto libertarians, skeptics have just as much a right to post here, and in all honesty we get a kick out of seeing this type of reaction.
I guess trying to discuss Bitcoin and the hurdles it faces objectively is tantamount to FUD and paid shilling in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:24:35
Lmao, a company that sells state secrets is banned from receiving Visa payments? Boo hoo.
I guess that's one more reason politicians have to call Bitcoin's legitimacy into question.
