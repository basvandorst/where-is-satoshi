The tool is crap. The analysis was done already and every top post in controversial sorted is the most negative one... it's a silly metric.

A nice way to think of it: The core is the World Wide Ledger, and Value Transfer Protocol, not global payment protocol, that will be on top of bitcoin...

Yup, and now get ready for the negative comments to show up first on this post, sorted by controversial!!
@_date: 2015-12-05 05:01:54
Is there anything we can do to get this moving quicker? Is there funding needed? Crowdsale?

It they mean "how it dies" as in how a bitcoins can be lost forever. ok... quite escalated wording there buddy magazine editor
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:09:16
This is amazingly cool
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:09:24
Yup. According to graph, around 2025-26, the lightning network should be able to handle all global transactions (needing 130mbish blocks) .

No no no :) 
This is what would happen temporarily if someone were to attack the network. Realistically, this would be a relatively rare occurance, and block size increase + off chain + lightning network / strawpay would smooth things out
@_date: 2015-06-05 02:49:22

That would be fun for the kids

I see it more as in "gentle introduction". Educate people first on the general things, then go into the deeper stuff. Once they understand that cryptography is math, truth, and how block chain works, you unravel the amazing digital gold: Bitcoin. BOOM, they will now understand it :)

"This technology does not run atop the bitcoin system itself—a system driven by a network of machines across the globe—but it uses the same basic software."

He's not against it, he's very much for it
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:30:11
Agreed. I think most of the older die hard bitcoiners (that hate regulation) are saddened

Thanks. And A lot of people could use a handy script like this!
@_date: 2015-06-25 18:11:17
They MAY work if they save hashes to the bitcoin block chain every once in a while to prove integrity... but still... why not use bitcoin + mysql.

Great post, there are potentially huge implications here
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:22:25
How safe is this method? It depends on the clock settings of the miner who verifies the transaction in the future?
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:40:48
Well said sir

They are worse. Coinbase lets you keep your own keys if you want to (but requires python script to retrieve)
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:31:32
He's correct, but not billions / second, more like thousands per second. Side Chains + lightning network + block size increase over time. 
Once blocks reach around 130mb, the bitcoin Lightning network could potentially handle all the world's transaction needs
@_date: 2015-06-25 03:00:05

The masses love sex, stimulation, and blowing shit up and killing people. GTA V is a huge hit - case in point. This is the subliminal connection to bitcoin. Bitcoin IS them, bitcoin is what they REALLY want to use. Bitcoin is freedom. Bitcoin is the future. 
Also, it's nice to hear that Bitcoin is traceable! +1 for that, more people need to know that it's not some magical anonymous funny money.

I don't think that's the point. They are talking about bitcoin being worth $1,000,000 in current USD, which could be different in the future. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 03:19:17
Absolutely! I still think it's profoundly interesting to think about this whole thing. The incentive to make useless ASICS just to beat the bitcoin network is like very little. What do you get? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:59:12
If you think of the Root as the child, and the ones below as it's ancestors, the blue squares are represent the opposite spouse of the next highest in the path to Hk. So the blue ones are required in order to create the root, and can be use to prove a transaction is included in the block

tl;dr: It's like a fancy buzzword version of excel or Mysql

Edit: Love this quote from Jon Matonis: "Hyperledger and Wall Street are perfect for each. Multiple private ledgers (blockchains) equal multiple versions of the truth."

@_date: 2015-06-23 17:19:11
It seems to me their plan was to run on Ethereum, but interact later on with bitcoin via sidechains. 
Levine: "So how do sidechains work in Etherium. I thought the whole point of ethereum was that it's turing complete and you can do whatever you want on it. Why would you need a sidechain?"
Augur: "The reason you'd want a sidechain, is so you can use bitcoin on it. If you look at Ethereum now all you're able to use is ethere. It's fine, but will have a smaller market cap than bitcoin, and liquidity... there is no circle.com or coinbase.com for ethere etc ... [and credit cards are not an option] sidechains allow you to use bitcoins [and get money into Augur or] on other chains (altcoins)."

Possibly, both Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen are on the board of facebook. Thiel was the first person to fund FB, and personally funded Zuckerberg $1 million way back in the day.
Both of these guys are betting on bitcoin companies, so there's definitely something to the rumor

Such a stupid case too. Completely blows my mind
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:56:24
It needs to have % increase as well, which gavin, hearn and other devs are thinking about - including Rusty Russell. (my thoughts: Otherwise we are stuck with the same exact situation int he future. )
8mb + x%
20mb + x%
1mb + x%
Something like that
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:03:36
And the lightning network needs only about ~130mb/block to handle traffic for 7 billion people using bitcoin. So 2024-25 here we come :)

Bitcoin and Counterparty for the win

by that time, nobody will even need to sell :) 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:17:18
Hey guys, the execution of this is very poor. 
1) No information on how to purchase with bitcoins, nor info on how new people can acquire them
2) There is no way to sort by 'pay with bitcoin' cinemas, or any easy way to find a cinema near you that you can pay withbitcoin
3) Because of  this whole thing comes off like a big joke

@_date: 2015-06-03 02:29:16
The "block size" drama is very healthy, and this conversation / debate will make bitcoin stronger.

Fuck! That's crazy. In fact, the drug shipping thing is definitely a bigger crime overall.
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:03:38
This is much bigger. Banks can't just go into bitcoin - it's still got a bad reputation (drug money, etc), and bitcoin doesn't have the capability just yet to handle it. And it's scary.
Enter private blockchain: The training wheels for pin stripe bankers. Let's get all of these guys excited for blockchain tech - mentally and psychologically ready. In 5 - 10 years or so these companies will move into the blockchain 'cloud' aka bitcoin, and it will be the second financial coming of christ.

... i'll go ahead and paste my other comment here:
Ah yes, the guy who says that Bitreserve is not a bitcoin company, and bitcoin is just a means to an end.
Why are you guys supporting this news? Bitreserve holds your funds, and you don't control the keys. Their transparency is a marketing gimmick. The executives think bitcoin is a fad, or a means to an end, to skip over regulation. Just look at their latest investor release: Paraphrasing: Our bitcoin phase is almost over. Seeya suckers, and thanks for the btc... oh and bitcoin won't be around in 5 years
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:18:06

@_date: 2015-06-16 21:09:05

What about Augur? They have a very nice project, which will likely use a sidechain as well. I wonder if they will utilize truthcoin.
The augur idea was inspired by truthcoin
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:48:32
The idea is that if the fees rise overall, spammers / attackers will have to pay more to make it 'the same' as you say above. This would likely end with some unhappy attackers

It utilizes its own 'blockchain' with servers being paid in factoid tokens, but saves frequently to the bitcoin blockchain. It absolutely requires bitcoin in order to keep full data integrity. So in that sense, it is a network built on top of bitcoin.

Ah yes, the guy who says that Bitreserve is not a bitcoin company, and bitcoin is just a means to an end.
Edit: Why are you guys supporting this news? Bitreserve holds your funds, and you don't control the keys. Their transparency is a marketing gimmick. The executives think bitcoin is a fad, or a means to an end, to skip over regulation. Just look at their latest investor release: Paraphrasing: Our bitcoin phase is almost over. Seeya suckers, and thanks for the btc... oh and bitcoin won't be around in 5 years

"James D’Angelo wants to cap the world’s carbon emissions, and he wants to do it using bitcoin — that digital currency you’ve heard about but don’t quite understand. The NASA engineer turned rapper turned conservationist turned cryptocurrency enthusiast turned YouTube personality calls his plan “the people’s cap-and-trade,” or Sno-Caps. It would give everyone in the world equal access to the carbon market, have almost no operating costs, and require zero government involvement."

There is no problem. There is a fee market.
If bocks start filling up, people can and will set higher fees to get in the block. The total fees will get much larger at that point.

Separate. Augur was inspired by Truthcoin. Truthcoin is a sidechain on bitcoin.
From what it sounds like, a professor was working on Truthcoin, and decided he didn't have time / etc to finish it. The augur guys decided to take up the idea and build on top of Etherium.
Now, it looks as though Roger Ver is reanimating the project, and I'm thinking the professor will be working on it full time.

If you can find the bitcoin via hard-drive recovery: It's like discovering a lost golden hoard on the bottom of the sea;

I think how it works is that Factom is like a specialized decentralized network that runs on top of bitcoin. Basically they need this network to facilitate real-time transactions, and then periodically save it on the blockchain for immutability.

IF someone put a sell order for $2mm of BTC on an exchange and I bought that $2mm, the price would remain the same. If they did a market sell order, it would lower the price, as it would be eating through buy orders.

"Secretive bitcoin startup 21 Inc has performed tests illustrating how its technology could enable machine-to-machine bitcoin transactions as part of a company overview created during the fundraising of its $75m Series C."
They had previous series, and it should add up to 116 Million.
Also a comment below by Coindesk writer Kenneth Howard:
"... The document states they had raised $30m of a $75m series c. They could have raised more, but with a $5m A and a $36m B that would be in line with what is out there.
$116m over multiple rounds"

Also add trustless to that too! It's not like visa :)
The lightning network is a super fast, trustless, offchain transactional network that doesnt require the blockchain until the point of final settlement.

- Factom (proof of existence - partnered with Microsoft Azure platform), Uses its own network, but hashes to the bitcoin network
- Ethereum: Decentralized Turing complete blockchain - with plans to have close relationship with Bitcoin, and potentially other currencies in the future.
- Maidsafe (decentralized, privacy centric, global internet / network), uses Omni Layer token Maidsafecoin, which will be converted to SafeCoins later on
- Omni Layer / Counterparty (Built "on" bitcoin): you can create your own tokens easily, with many options.

Welcome to the corporate world I assume you just got out of university and you're new to this type of thing. People leave for various reasons. People come and go in companies. Coinbase will live on, and prosper well.
This is a GOOD thing. If people vehemently disagree about something, it is best for them to leave, and let the vision carry on unhinged by @_date: 2016-01-05 22:06:14
So true. I think if bitcoin goes past ATH we'll see it go much higher and crash down higher than 2013. 
The ATH in 2013 is the ONLY thing anyone can say that is 'bad'. It's the only major PR thing bitcoin has to overcome. Mt Gox is slowly fading away... the price, it's always in your face.

It allows you to create a chain pegged to bitcoin. So the value of your coins on that chain are pegged to the value of BTC. You can transfer from your chain, back to BTC as well, and vice-versa

It works beautiful, and uses the camera for QR code too.
Steps (for others out there interested in seeing how fast it is):
1. Put in rushwallet.com on your phone, show them the url (sometime people don't understand "rush wallet" (like foreign waiters, etc), have them type it in. (10 seconds)
2. They move their finger around the screen to create a key (5 seconds)
3. Tell them to favorite it right now (save thebookmark) (5 seconds)
4. Send the BTC (5 seconds) 
About: 25 seconds total to send the BTC

We are in the age of 1st rate scams: Rather than anonymous dudes on bitcointalk who changed a few lines, and pumped up a shitcoin, we now have what looks to be highly credible teams, with credible backing, pushing ... the same thing people did before on bitcointalk, but in a much larger way, to a larger audience. 
1. The entire scheme relies on the fact that they have "solved" the issues in proof of stake. However, it is clear they have not proven this, and thus, this is their marketing ploy. 
2. The secondary level of the scheme relies on what looks to be a solid venture backing, and strategic advisory team. However, upon further examination, the venture team looks to be second rate.
3. The last later is the gullibility of the company's team: These are people who got fed the "Blockchain &gt; bitcoin" line, and most likely were attracted by the media's anti-bitcoin campaign and "bitcoin = drugs" rhetoric", but got pulled in the space by the "blockchain is the future of fintech" political correctness, and generalization.

They use their own issued value token (not via counterparty or omni/mastercoin) called a Factoid (much like how Storj uses the Storj coin via counterparty). However, every so often things are hashed onto the bitcoin blockchain, to ensure immutability, and hence the real importance of Factom. The reason they do this seems to be so Factom itself stays real-time, and only has to touch the blockchain infrequently.

It works like this: 
2014: Gutenberg library is hashed via Factom, and then stores on the bitcoin blockchain.
2014, a few days later: You decide to check factom's work by hashing the Gutenberg library yourself, and verify it on the bitcoin blockchain: Looks good.
2017: Some guy at Gutenberg decides to remove some sentences he doesn't like from ancient texts, and then makes that the copy available.
2017, a few months after: You decide one day to download the gutenberg (you've since removed the other copy you had) library to do some data science on it, but decide to check the integrity of it first. You know the most reliable source is the factom hash on the blockchain, so you decide to compare the downloaded copy to the factom copy, and their hashes don't match, so it's clear something was changed. So even though you don't have the original yet, you know the one being served isn't the correct one.
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:31:31

Just replied more fully above. It sounds like Augur is using bitcoin as an outlet for publicity, and acceptance, as it's the largest crypto community, but what exactly is it doing for this ecosystem? That's kinda really important to a lot of people here:  
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:00:14
I think they've been consistent, but not the best at explaining what Factom does exactly. They have hashed the gutenberg library on the blockchain, so anyone can *prove the existence* of the library by doing the hashing themselves and comparing. So if some bad actor at the gutenberg website decides to change a few sentences, we'll know the data is not pure.
The question then is: where do we get the original data? I think that's where Storj will come in.

Last night there was a LOT of partying and bonding, and bitcoin people are big networkers, so they value that stuff... likely overslept.

Seriously people, a huge internet company accepts bitcoin, and supports it, and you guys whine and complain about the  % increase in price.
This is the porn industry ... you simply don't care about a 60% increase if you really want to use Bitcoin for your fap material

Good one! I heard about this from Jeff Garzik here in this presentation: 
It could stop basic robberies, or muggings.

Yeah I noticed this today. It just takes 5 people in collusion to do something like this, or a few bots.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:45:42
Edit: He really doesn't endorse 100, he clearly says 8mb, and whatever increases it. He mentions 100 because Garzik is on their team.
Most likely because they are being political and see BIP101 as bad for their image? Come on guys
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:43:23
They could easily upload videos almost every day. That would give them 1,000x more transparency.

Yes obviously... if you involve yourself in bitcoin, be prepared for a WILD ride. Huge uncertainty, fluctuation. They are just whining and making excuses for not hedging or managing risk. This is a very nasceant industry

Well LN was only just funded this year, and there's not much need for more people, as the code is open source anyways. This will give ample time for potential developers to learn the codebase, and get hired in, as well as time for funding from other companies.

Maybe explains why Jgarzik doesn't have him listed as working in bitpay since early 2015? 
@_date: 2015-09-19 01:35:41
Basically these HUGE scammers payed him $30,000 to be lead sponsor of this conference, and shines (no joke) a huge projection of their shit coin logo on the side of the hotel at the party, with a tiny logo of bitcoin. It was a titanic embarrassment, but a good laugh nonetheless. 
He didn't take them off the sponsorship / give them money back, it was a mess. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:04:08
His behavior has been nothing but talking down bitcoin and its industry. He has said zero positive things. 
At this point he seems to be swimming happily in his "troll" reputation.
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:49:15
I'm curious how many people / businesses that don't have a bank account, who could use bitcoin to their benefit
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:36:46
A lot of people were REALLY pissed at that 'flash crash' situation, and probably contacted the CFTC, I doubt this is an ongoing thing

I like how Trace doesn't actually say if he had Gavin Clarify or not. He just goes off on a tangent. Makes you wonder if Trace was just quietly angry at Gavin during the dinner.

I feel like if you got Gavin pissed enough he'd have one hell of a right hook. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:34:39
You'd get way more upvotes and a longer lasting with a slightly modified title - as many people probably downvoted because they disagreed

Question: It says toward the end that you can never lose your child's birth certificate. I thought Factom didn't store data, only proof that the data exists. Something like Storj does store data.
So how can you never lose it if it doesn't store it?
Edit: I'm going to assume the answer is a combination of Storj + Factom, as the teams work closely together, and some of the Storj guys are on the Factom team.

Not at all actually. What Stacy is saying is that banks don't understand blockchains, because if they did they would know they needed to use bitcoin or have a value toke (just like Hipsters don't know about the truth of Che. If they did, they would know he was a psycho). 
It is false  ideas / total misunderstanding about a meme. Blockchain = banks meme. Che = hipster's meme

If Augur is running on an altcoin (Ethereum), it would be **really great** to emphasize on this sub how bitcoin / bitcoiners will be useful long term to Augur. Based on this link ( it sounds like bitcoin (unless you use TetherUSD stable coin, and/or the side-chain implementation isn't just a toy) isn't really even something important to the project at all, which makes it look like the project is simply riding the wave of ignorant, or naive bitcoiners, to pump and hype.

Hey Flibbr, 
This is pure and utter garbage reporting. That's not $2 trillion in cash or money in the bank. The data of $2 Trillion comes from a Reuters intelligence report (
This number represents natural resources such as oil / gas / mineral and other resources deep in the ground. The United states is worth something like $128 Trillion
I'm pretty shocked the media picked that up to propagandize.
The $2-3 billion income number is a real reflection to their financials / assets.

Coinbase is passable. Blockchain is totally ridiculous 
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:06:10
Tried to decipher, this is what i got so far... nothing too crazy and doesn't seem illegal (the "inside job" accusation appears to be the 2 Krohns working at both companies):
* Vanessa Krohn was working at BTC Media since October 4, 2013 (
* She was / is wife of Bryan Krohn or relative: their google+ page has eachother listed as freinds 
* A hack occured at BTC media from David Bailey's computer (he was at a Korean conference), and sent Bryan Krohn (again, husband or relative of Vanessa Krohn of btc media) a link to a google doc phishing, and Krohn entered the details. see 
* Hacker sent email from Krohn's account to Stephan Pair asking for 5,000 bitcoins (from their second market account).
* BTC Media bought Bitcoin Magazine from owner Tony Gallippi January 21, 2015. see 
That's all i got so far. How much was Bitcoin Magazine sold for? What is the bitstamp connection exactly?

He was clearly talking about "SPV wallet / client" and he really should have added the "client/wallet" part, because by god, he should have known he was going to be hunted down like a witch by the devs, and people in the community like you, had he not.

Didn't mean to come across all high and mighty :)
I find it "stupid" because it's so offensive. He's implying they are attacking bitcoin. A 51% attack is something very serious: Either revise transaction history or prevent new transactions from confirming (or worse)... that doesn't sound like something Gavin or Mike ever wanted to do. They simply want to get more transactions in per block. Calling them attackers is simply childish behavior...

Some interesting background: Bill Barhydt was an early employee of Netscape, the company that Marc Andreessen Co-founded (and Ben Horowitz was one of the first product mangers there).
They built the first major browser. This arguably was the major turning points of bringing mass adoption to the internet. 
The largest VC firm in the world is now Andreessen Horowitz, and 21's closest partner, and investor.
This seems like a tight nit group of smart dudes (Barhydt, Marc, Ben, Balaji, etc) who can pull through a revolution in finance, and help build up bitcoin's infrastructure, and... quite possibly change the world

Own part of it: Owned by "Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder and Agnelli families"
Agnellis married into the Rothschilds at some point. Both are highly influential families, and funded much of the liberal globalization process. The schroder family is like co-king (more in the social sense) of finance circles in the City with Rothschild. Schroder having more clout in the city, but Rothschilds having far more clout in Parisian power circles.
These families generally made up the the City / Labour / Trade union faction / block that lobbied for free trade, gold standard, and using the military to enforce free trade and open new markets - opposed to the closed "british empire" and nationalist military economy factions. 
Maybe a return to days of old, but a "bitcon standard"?

And... There is absolutely not a single mention of a Snowden bitcoin company anywhere. Nice one looks like you trolled hard

It's not to be taken literally like ok 2 years or dump to zero. It's a cycle that this industry will go through.

Eric Schmidt, chairman of google invested in Blockstream, so that tells you the powers that be in google know very well what bitcoin is, and might even have long term plans
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:42:58
I think it was cool that he mentioned it was the currency of the future, so in a way setting it up for the beyond drugs stage

Whats the reason for that?

Um... what? "Charles was a founder of two of the most important companies in the bitcoin space – Ethereum and Bitshares."
@_date: 2015-11-30 03:58:30
It's not .01%, but that's just one of many possibilities. 
I think Barbardos Central bank has almost $668 Million in reserves (
So 0.01% of that is $66,800, or about 190 Bitcoins
The paper says:
"This assessment provides an assessment of the potential
differences in volatility and returns that could have resulted from investments in
Bitcoin. Relatively small investment ratios of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 percent are considered
and for comparison purposes a scenario where 5 percent of the reserves are invested in
Bitcoin is also considered."
So that means .01% is 190 bitcoins, .1% is 1,900 BTC, 1% is 19,000BTC and 5% is 95,000BTC

He never said anything about an acronym. He coined the term "SPV client" or "SPV wallet". Very simple... nothing big.

Most of those startups still need a year or two, it's not been that long yet. They provide mostly seed funding too, so they're not worried.
If just one or two of the startups do 100x they are going to be very happy.
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:47:47
Yup, this.
Been telling people here for about a year. Bitreserve was never a bitcoin company, and they never stated so. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:32:59
Bitcoin will fuel 100x more good than bad. There will always be bad.

Yeah, we've known about this issue for a while. He wrote a tiny, simple script to do it. Doesn't mean he actually understands bitcoin (which is clear his comments of POW energy waste, and saying bitcoin is a ponzi scheme). 
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:16:04
We need to up-vote main stream media disinformation and point out the inaccuracies, and call to action: contact the writers, news companies and set the record straight, not keep it hidden
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:28:56
She was referring to a blockchain that does not use POW, so you are technically correct. The real blockchain needs security, and immutability
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:15:02
What if I told you in 5 years, there will be so much bitcoin saturation, and price deflation, that they won't have to dump?

I assume you're talking about censorship of Gavin Andresen's Bitcoin XT? I think that's the most unbelievable case of sidelining and censorship I've ever seen in a bitcoin community. Definitely made me very sad.

Here is the truth:
 - 
Watson [The CEO of bitreserve] knows the perception that some have of digital currency, and it doesn’t concern him. “I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,” he said. “It’s a means to an end. The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away too.
 - 
"If 1H can be categorized as building the Foundation of Bitreserve, then 2H will be categorized as Bitreserve entering its Commercialization Phase. The bottleneck for Bitreserve’s growth remains bitcoin. That now ends in 2H 2015. Starting this summer, we will be able to start to speak to that other 99.99% of our addressable market who are not confined to holding bitcoin."
*My Translation: Phase 1 - We used bitcoin to get here (phew, thank god that's over!), phase 2 - We're ditching bitcoin for fiat, to reach more people in our centralized service, where we control the money like paypal.*

"I'll be focusing most of my time on building new and interesting things in the bitcoin space."
