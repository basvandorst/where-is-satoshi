Yes sir. We are more like circle and coinbase. What do you think of credit cards? Will people pay a premium just to get coins conveniently via credit cards?   Spot on. Hako is indeed box in Japanese. We do have plans to expand regionally, but we are currently laser focused in serving Singapore and working on an awesome product. Bitcoin's biggest challenge is UX and education, and that is our current priority. Feel free to shoot me more questions! @_date: 2014-11-10 07:42:55

Literally just sign up and buy. We are serious about our tagline! We only accept local bank transfer at e moment, but international payment methods are in our short term roadmap!

We do that at [Coinhako]( Just launched our service a couple of weeks ago and currently only serving Singapore. Soon to expand across the region!

Hey r/bitcoin,  what a pleasant surprise. We didn't expect [CoinHako]( to come up on reddit this quickly. Coinhako just opened to public a couple of days ago, and we are still working to provide minimal(yet sufficient) info on our landing page.  Unfortunately, we are only serving local customers till we find a feasible way to accept international payments. Thanks OP but you are missing the words "startup **from Asia**".
