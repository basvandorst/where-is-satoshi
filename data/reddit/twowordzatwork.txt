I don't think it is really complex, by today's standards. ASICs have been around since the mid 80's.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:14:18
Any reasons for thinking that?

It was the comment after the article...

Alright, and if you can get working Trigger Limit Orders, that would be great... Lost money on virtex during the crash...

Think of it more like a printed circuit board. At first, it was incredibly hard to make them. Now you can get them for $20 from from china, custom built for your needs.  
My point is, it might seems very complex but for people in the field, it isn't a big deal. There is a big starting cost to get the first one out of the door but once started, they can make them cheaply and quickly.

This subreddit doesn't need that kind of posts.

If you remove all the memes and pics, you will see that 90% of the front page is filtered.

We need cheaper trading fees too!

Not sure about this, even if you pay for a good with bitcoins, it will still stop at the border where it will be assigned a taxable value and you will need to pay duties in money to get it delivered to you.

But there would be no bitcoin without the early adopters...

This is a good answer. Now that there is no risk, everything is gravy. No need to be greedy.

Go for it, I did my first purchase at 109 and bought again at 185 yesterday.

It's was too late before you commented...

Your question has absolutely nothing to do with OP's post.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:48:36
Not willing to do it here!

The volume on mtgox is 46k right now, I would think you don't need much more than 10-20k to influence the market no? I'm curious why you say you need 100k? Maybe I'm missing something?

I suggest you address your question to @_date: 2013-04-10 12:40:47
OP, I don't want to rub it in but you trusted a free site hosted on appspot.com and a stranger before trusting your own computer?  
  
I would never use any vanity generator (it is exactly what it's called... vanity) or an online brainwallet service... never trust a third party with your money.  
  
Sometimes it feels like Bitcoin is the AOL of banking... all the scammers are having a free ride.

There would be 11/21 of the world assets if they didn't adopt early. My point is there would be no value at all in bitcoin without them.
