Wow. Really proves that success doesn't come overnight. Admire your patience. Though BTC had been in a roller coaster ride for the past years still you were able to make it to the 21 million club. Im still in the process of achieving that too with the help of a good upcoming exchange [platform]( that provides users with a friendly interface for trading crypto-fiat and crypto-crypto. It also provides safety, the speed of use and lower exchange commissions. Hope I can make it too. ��

I see. Thanks. Just amazing how much crypto had made a difference in todays society. It certainly helped a lot of people especially in terms of business and investment. Well me, I use it for leisure. Lol I am using it to play for an online [casino]( always having a good time when I am playing. :) It provides variety of games especially for the slot machine which i love the most.

With the trend still sideways it's hard to determine whether there will be a reversal already or it will continue to go down. Guess will just have to wait for a strong evidence before entering the market again. Meanwhile will use my btc playing online games. Lol
