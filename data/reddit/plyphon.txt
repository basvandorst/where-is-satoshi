Go to your local McDonalds, ask them what money they accept.
“Money” is whatever you’ve got to give them for them to give you your 20 chicken nuggets in return.

Right - but what do people and you want bitcoin to be? An investment or a currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:55:13
That’s correct - gold and silver are not money. You can test that by tying to spend some gold at your local store - the clerk will look at you like you’re mad (and won’t accept it unless it’s the shadiest of places).

You’ve kind of just agreed with the point I’m making - the point is no one is encouraging using their bitcoin to buy goods, but as only a value store to exchange for a profit into USD. That’s what I’m talking about. 
Once you’ve bought your loaf of bread, you can’t then go into another store and exchange that for some milk, you first need to sell it to get money to exchange for the milk. 
Currently, people are only talking about selling their bitcoin to get USD, and not talking about exchanging it for their bread.

It may be pedantry but I feel it’s an important signifier of the zeitgeist surrounding bitcoin and crypto. If no one is seeing bitcoin as something they exchange, but rather as goods they’re selling - it’s not being seen as money (whose existence is to exchange for goods and services - not investment).
We have to remember bitcoin is an experiment and this is important insight into that experiment.

Errrraahhhh I’m not sure I agree with that. I more than agree that wealth =/= money. I tried to do some googling around “money vs currency” but couldn’t find a credible source explaining that concept further - only (conveniently) crypto websites and weird bogus misinformation websites - nothing from a respected financial institution for example. 
The very definition is (as per google):
 a system of money in general use in a particular country.

Kind of, but also kind of not. 
You don’t “exchange” a good or service, you sell it. You wouldn’t walk into a shop and ask “‘how much are you exchanging that pint of milk for?” - it doesn’t make sense.
Again, the confusion is around bitcoin being seen not as currency but as goods.
You can exchange currency, it’s literally called an “exchange rate” on the “foreign exchange market” - not the sell rate on the foreign sell market. 
You sell goods and services, you exchange currency, stocks, options and other financial entities. 
Currently people are talking about selling their bitcoin, not exchanging it.

The concept of “selling” money is a bit weird - what you often say is you’re “exchanging” money, whether that’s forex (foreign exchange) or for goods and services.
If the very concept of “selling” bitcoin is still a thing in 20 years, that means it’s not become liquid enough to be seen as an exchange for goods and services, and is still being used as some sort of store of wealth for investment purposes. 
I guess there’s nothing down right wrong about that, other than the fact the objective was to become money - in which case it will have failed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:37:42
That’s an interesting thought - can you share some sources on that? I’ve done a quick google on “currency vs money” and the only things that come up are weird bogus advice type websites and crypto enthusiast type websites - nothing from a credible source or respected financial institution.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:58
Literally every figure is a milestone “sell” moment.
And on and on...
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:55:42
You’re not wrong - there has been a massive change of sentiment in online communities from 
“try to spend it as much as you can to help bitcoin become liquid (currency)” 
to 
“don’t sell any because the price will go up again!”
If you’re not exchanging (“selling”) it for anything then it’ll never become a currency.

Not with that attitude it isn't !

I remember those, and the minecraft casino servers you could bet 0.05btc at a time 
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:55:27
There used to be (probably still is) servers where you could go on and play virtual slot machines and win BTC. I can't remember if you had to bet your own BTC or if it was for free, now I think about it.

Yup - understood completely thanks :)

[Serious] Surely if you have a paper wallet not tied to any online wallet/exchange (obviously) then the coins in that wallet are 100% anonymous?
I appreciate to buy the coins in the first place you would need to be on an exchange, hence anonymity lost.
