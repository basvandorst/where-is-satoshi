Reproducing the hash of anything even given a general idea is super hard unless you know the exact details. You are making this sound easy. I'd be curious to know if you could reproduce the hash.   
u/nullc maybe you can shed light on this? I'm not sure if you put out the proof somewhere.. I'm giving a presentation on this bug tomorrow at a meetup. Not sure if you already published this somewhere. Thanks in advance for your time.

ok.. guess we have to wait until then.. I just found it odd that it was referenced in the full disclosure without more details of proof
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:46:37
so [freewallet.io]( works but is useless because it won't let users copy-paste off the app. Still in search of another wallet I guess.

last update to that repo was 11 months ago.. none the less I submitted an issue.

A couple of us were trying to do it a few weeks ago.. and it seemed that 2 of the iphones we used were unable to copy and paste.. we tried long presses.. what method are you using for it to prompt you to copy? Thanks in advanced.. also please let me know what iphone OS you are using that might help me understand why it failed for us.

Thank you for the kind words.. We plan to continue blocktime in the near future.

so in other words.. better to use a blockchain that a diverse amount of people use instead of having one for an  isolated group or country.
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:18:58
interesting theory, with generally good advice if you're correct, but you should of made this a true self fulfilling prophecy by giving us the price of the height of the next bullrun, a date and time would help as well. preferably est timezone. thanks.

Please explain how this requires a central authority.  I would say the opposite we now have an elegant way of not requiring a central authority for proof of time of a digital signature.. just like a bitcoin transaction doesn't require a central authority for integrity or time.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:18:35
kinda agree... needs to grow a pair
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:51:16
I'm by far no expert, but the idea would be "appear indistinguishable from regular single-signature on-chain transaction"
meaning you would still have the ability to verify inputs = outputs. (This is still 'clear text' per say). For this to be possible you need to "combine Schnorr signatures with MAST"  
I believe there aren't apparent "down-sides" yet with soft-forking in these changes. (at least that I know of). I think it's a win-win for privacy and efficiency, without giving up the ability to audit the total supply.
This is my current impression. Please correct me if you find out something different.

Bitcoin Depot is an awesome company and also sponsors the local Atlanta blockchain meetup group (TAB)..   
If anyone is in the Atlanta area the next topic will be about tokens on Bitcoin through Counterparty.

so... if the amount gets high enough.. you're bond to have someone eventually steal the money.. it seems.

I apologise.. can someone please explain what the heck is going to someone seeing this for the first time?

Is there a way for MyCellium to show fund have been sent before a confirmation similar to other wallets?
@_date: 2015-07-18 17:03:16
I sent 2 transactions spaced by 2 minutes.  Both transactions were for the same amount of BTC and same fee.  
The Later one actually got confirmed in about 15 minutes. (wtf?)  
The other got confirmed in 25 minutes. 
How can I ensure that my transactions get to the next available block? I would of liked to of saw them both getting confirmed in 15 minutes. 
I was wondering if the fee needed to be higher and if so is there a formula or app to predict what a valid fee would be at the time due to network activity?
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:51:30
Is there a way to ensure that my transactions are included in the next available block?  It seems to be somewhat random.  I had a similar transaction sent a couple minutes later: (same amount, same fee) sent to another address; this was included in an earlier block.  
@_date: 2015-07-18 17:31:53
Ok, that makes sense.  
Might be a dumb question.. shouldn't there always be 1 output?  I understand the many inputs. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:04:50
This is an excellent question and a valid concern.The idea is to cut through the hype of "blockchain" mainly focusing around PoW public permissionless free blockchains.Then invite enough intelligent Bitcoin speakers and attendees to help convert people away from the crap. I like the idea of attendees coming away with a new outlook on the entire space of "blockchain". 
We are also planning to have panels where people can debate on why one coin is better over another.. possible debates/panels include Bitcoin vs BCH ..ETH vs ETC.. PoW vs PoS.. Private vs Public blockchains and maybe a governance panel where people can talk about things like if a developers fund built into the protocol is necessary ..like Dash vs Bitcoin.
If you would like to nominate any Bitcoin speakers for the event we would love to have more.. I will also be reaching out to some of the scaling bitcoin guys. Still looking for good speakers in the realm of LN.

copper isn't usually Troy oz... Troy oz is mainly for silver and gold.. i think.. it's a normal ounce for copper because it's less dense and takes up the same space as a silver coins.

same reference pretty much that you put up DigitalGoose

think about all the great technologies that surpassed their original intent. Edit: Misread what you were saying.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:18:48
so maybe separate side chains for other types of transactions?  then the main chain being used primarily as a value store..? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:32:28
would you be able to answer the 2nd half of the question about LN and SC?
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:30:09
to certain extent ..sure.. but blasphemy against what exactly.. I'm just seeking other opinions and information. I would hope everyone would do the same.

We're doing a blocktime podcast tomorrow.. feel free to follow me on twitter  to get the link to join the live chat to ask questions during the podcast. 
We will be talking about some crazy stuff tomorrow as well. Glad Blocktime is finally hitting the top of r/bitcoin.
We're just 3 guys trying to get smarter in this space so any helpful comments and questions are welcomed.
