How? I've written Wikipedia articles about subjects where there wouldn't otherwise be *anything* on the web about the topic. Before writing that article, the information was only available in expensive academic journals that are locked up behind institutional paywalls.
The content is all licensed under CC BY-SA, so you can print it, share it, translate it, remix it, package it up in a book and sell it, whatever the hell you want to do with it.

Except perhaps a letter in all your neighbour's letterboxes telling them you are a paedophile.

Wikimedia NYC chapter take Bitcoin. Feel free to give them some. Maybe if you flood them with a couple hundred BTC, that might send a bigger message to the Foundation than whining.
Their Bitcoin address is linked from here:

Nifty. I might go try it out at the weekend.

If donating is such an impulse buy, perhaps Bitcoin users might want to donate to the Wikimedia New York City chapter, which has accepted Bitcoin for a while.

I'm a Wikipedia admin. I've written articles, edit stuff, upload photos. All that jazz.
If you wanna give me some Bitcoins, I'll happily spend it on beer and maybe a few books to use to write articles from. 1ACLSJjYBNp9XLzxJKxGAtRq71pheWrnvX

Really? Because, like, my parents are perfectly able to go to PayPal and type in their email and password.
To get Bitcoins, they need to set up a stack of web site accounts, possibly make an international bank transfer to someone who looks very much like a criminal, or buy them off some dude in a bar, or something which feels a bit less like a legitimate money transfer and a bit more like buying weed or sending money to a 100% genuine Nigerian prince. Just saying.

That was sort of the intention of pending changes.

I'm in London. Where's my nearest Bitcoin ATM exactly?
Also, this apt-get thing. Doesn't seem to work on Macs or Windows machines. But, **HAY GUYS THIS YEAR WILL BE THE YEAR OF DESKTOP LINUX, PROMISE!**
Put yourself in the mindset of the average Wikipedia reader, not the average Reddit neckbeard. Bitcoin has miles to go before being as usable as PayPal.

That's because they have to pay programmers. Programmers need to eat and pay rent, neither of which you can do with BTC.
They have to pay for a server farm. And you can't pay for that in BTC either.

I'm sure an Ashley Madison alternative where you can only have affairs with other people who have Bitcoins will be popular.

Following hyperinflation, the Zimbabwean dollar has been abandoned.
The Zimbabwean government now use USD and the population can use one of eight official currencies including: USD, GBP, Botswanan pulas, South African rands, Indian rupees, yen, Australian dollars, Chinese yuans.
And the central bank are okay with this...

You can donate to Wikimedia NYC chapter using Bitcoin.
Plus, OpenStreetMap Foundation - the "Wikipedia of maps" - takes Bitcoin.
