The chart interface truly sucks compared to GDAX, Volume is half across all pairs compared to Gdax...a not so stellar debut and I hope they fix this or they will go the way of Bitterex.

Great points, all the signs were there... seems like this was all planned out in 2016 by some market makers. Makes me crazy to think how I was dumb money to “Hodl”.
Edit: but w/ the caveat, “don’t invest more than you can afford to lose”. The PTB have to tell you what’s coming in advance “predictive programming” to protect their karma.

Any speculation on how much hard USD is invested in the market?

Lot’s of $$$ on the sidelines from those who sold high, additionally there are those average joes thinking right now that they could triple their money if it goes back to $20k. How many folks scooped up that $200 BTC in 2014 thinking they’d 6x their cash if it went back to $1200.00? Since that time, BTC went mainstream...

The Futures market is killing BTC and and the price will be suppressed just like gold &amp; silver. Like the head of CMOE quoted, “we will tame Bitcoin”.... and then All the FUD started w/ coordinated attack from the PTB who want no competition to their central bank system. When it was approaching 10k in early May, they even trotted out Warren Buffett to call it “Rat Poison”. This drop has been engineered to turn off the normies, and get us to “hate btc”. It’s really a heartbreaker....
