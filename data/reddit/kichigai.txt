How so? Ostensibly he wants to keep money inside the US, being spent on things produced in the US, yes? Bitcoin could offer a way to side-step any kind of capital controls put in place on money transferred abroad, and those capital controls would push people to use Bitcoin.
So ostensibly that all sounds good for Bitcoin, by giving people a damn good reason to adopt it. However if enough people started going to Bitcoin to transfer money, or a large enough amount of money started to be transferred with it, don't you think he'd start to try and impose some kind of controls on it too? Either through things like egregiously complicated and restricting regulations, or an outright ban on its use? Trump's done a pretty good job getting his supporters whipped up into a frenzy over his demonization of certain demographic groups and individuals, I doubt he'd have a problem getting some people to buy into Bitcoin primarily being a tool used by criminals. So it would simultaneously cast a pall over both Bitcoin, and those who use Bitcoin.
And don't forget that this is the candidate that wanted to "shut down" parts of the Internet. I wouldn't be surprised if he started to call for making attempts at shutting down access to the Bitcoin network. Now, granted, there would most likely be some ways to circumvent that, but a government ban would definitely scare off a lot of people and have an impact on wide-spread adoption.
Now, regardless of the feasibility of all that, having a guy with that kind of mindset in the White House likely would not be good for Bitcoin, at least in the short-term, but likely leaving a longer term stain on its reputation in the general public. The best thing for Bitcoin would more likely be a candidate that is against censorship of the Internet, and one who doesn't want to impose a lot of capital controls. So a Libertarian candidate would be "the best thing," but not necessarily the most likely.

Depends on the definition of "success." For Valve anything that exceeds the cost of integrating Bitpay is a success, as everything beyond that is potentially a sale they might not have made. For Bitpay anything is a success since it's all money they wouldn't have made without Valve.
Even if Valve doesn't do big business with Bitcoin it still could possibly benefit from the PR boost, and Bitpay could benefit from the clout of having such a big client on board.

Not quite. BTC for Euro *equivalent credit* exchange. So whatever the BTC-to-Euro exchange rate is the amount of credit they have locked in, which can be spent on stuff on Steam. So if you can buy fewer Euros with BTC tomorrow then you've locked in some value. If you can buy more Euros with BTC tomorrow, well, too bad.

More than likely they probably *do* understand Bitcoin way more than they let on. Their job isn't to debate the guest, it's to play proxy for their viewers. What questions would the viewers ask? How much do their viewers know about this subject? What things does the viewer need to know to understand these things?
So in this case the viewer may not know anything about Bitcoin, and just have a ton of misconceptions, so you dumb down your questions to that level, you bring up those misconceptions, and give the guest a chance to educate your viewers. Nine times out of ten they already know the answers to the questions they're going to ask because they had to do research in order to write their follow-up questions.
The whole purpose of interviews like this is so you don't have the guests sitting up there saying, "we did some research about Bitcoin because we think you should know about it. Here's the stuff we learned" and then read off their list. They call in someone with some authority, and then engineer the interview questions to get the guest to convey the information.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:21:40
Nice copy pasta.
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:20:01
No, that is absolutely *not* how the system is supposed to work, and this is an example of the problems in this subreddit.


The purpose of the up/down system is to highlight comments that contribute, and I'd argue dissenting opinion *do* contribute. They can force people to think critically about the opinions they hold, rather than simply accepting them at face value because of groupthink. They can add a dab of reality to a run-away circle jerk. They can also bring to light information, opinions, and considerations that other people may never have considered before.
"Downvote and move on" doesn't convince people of your position, it just discourages people from speaking up and drives the community into eventual stagnation. People think, "well, if I say what I think and it turns out I'm wrong I'm just going to get downvoted into oblivion and ignored, so I better not say anything in case I make a mistake."
Remember the Blockchain Size debate? If the number of people who were talking about increasing the size were originally in the minority their opinion likely would have been quashed before any kind of real debate could have happened. Instead the discussion that did happen ended up bringing to light a whole host of different considerations and ideas. "Downvote if you disagree" could have killed that discussion before it ever had a chance to get anywhere.
If the system worked then people would be following the community guidelines when posting stuff: "News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news." But if you looked at the top stories over the past 30 days we have [a story about Apple and Encryption]( (remember the Smash Your iPhone thing?), [a story about Iceland]( [a story about the US Supreme Court]( [Reddit's change in TOS]( and [a story about mobile payment apps]( On page 2, [there's a story about surveillance]( [another story about encryption]( and [a story about Hillary Clinton]( Not a single one of those stories mentions Bitcoin anywhere in the article.

I had no idea people thought citing the information from which I derived my opinion was a bad thing. Is anyone other than going to bother actually trying to explain why they find this so distasteful, maybe even try and convince me of their viewpoint, or are they just going to hide behind the anonymity of the ~~downvote~~ disagree button?

It was only the second movie I ever considered not watching all the way through; the other one was a three-and-a-third hour long Soviet-era film about a 15^th century Iconographer, and I watched the six hour version of *Das Boot* and loved it. It remains the only movie I could not watch while sober, and I finished it up out of sheer spite for how bad it was. (I have yet to steel my liver against the onslaught that are the next two parts)
The acting was sub-par at best, but otherwise the director was too caught up in circlejerking about how great the original book was that he couldn't be arsed into attempting to prove anything. He was on some kind of all-holy-is-Ayn-Rand crusade that he just forced everything in a modern context to fit into her time.
Let's be honest: *Atlas Shrugged*, as a piece of literature, was an awful specimen. Ayn Rand was overly wordy, her attitudes on relationships was almost mechanical, and the dialogue was wooden. When you hear people say they liked Ayn Rand's work the first thing they talk about is the philosophy that is espoused in her books, which in the interests of disclosure I'll admit are philosophies I generally disagree with but feel are worth learning about and discussing nonetheless.
So what we have in *Atlas Shrugged* is a good idea (the demonstration of Rand's philosophies). We have a basic plot which demonstrates the philosophy if adequately interpreted, characters, events, everything necessary for a good story. But the producer on some kind of crusade decides he's going to make *Atlas Shrugged*, the movie, but it's going to be just like the book except for the fact it's set in post-2008 America. And he keeps everything and edits nothing. The end result is a movie that is beyond Syfy-grade bad. At least Syfy movies know they're bad.
The producer treated *Atlas Shrugged* like it was Shakespeare. And maybe for a few it was like Shakespeare, but even Kenneth Branagh who treats Shakespeare's works like a Saint's, will rearrange two scenes so the whole thing works better as a film! What the producer *should* have done, if he wanted to make a good movie, was take the Akira Kurosawa approach and properly translate the work into another time and culture.
A key precept in video and film production is "show, do not tell." We had this drilled into us all the time in school. That was an enormous metric by which we were measured. The first few minutes of *Atlas Shrugged* was nothing but exposition. It told us, it did not show us. Now if that sounds petty consider how many movies in the last twenty years started off with a narrated prologue that explained the world into which you, the viewer, were about to be thrust? The *Dark Knight* trilogy didn't, and yet its world was unreal but supposed to be as ours. *The Lord of the Rings* took us on a great expansive quest of two separate groups, and yet we filled in the gaps without a monologue up at the beginning of the film setting things up. *Robocop* which remade medical science as we know it to tell its story didn't even try that.
If the producer had seen the forest for the trees he would have rewritten the story so that explanations of the world as it was supposed to be in the film was woven into the plot. He would have more properly translated Rand's ideas into the modern world. He needed to be willing to discard bits and pieces along the way to tell the story. Tell it to today's audience, not the audience of 1957 and expect us to simply accept it as gospel.
He needed to take the Kurosawa approach. Kurosawa turned *MacBeth* into a feudal samurai story that not only was extremely faithful to the source material but is considered to be the best film adaptation of The Bard's play to have yet been produced. Instead, that didn't happen. The first chapter opened to crowds that numbered smaller than the number of folks who tune in to watch Syfy's fare, which, I would argue, is artistically and intellectually less interesting (by orders of magnitude) but far more entertaining and watchable.
I **hated** the first *Atlas Shrugged*, and I disagree with a lot of Rand's ideas, but that movie was not what her ideas deserved. That movie was nothing greater than masturbation over Rand and a refusal to accept that she was just as flawed a human being as any of us.

This was probably a pre-taped and edited interview.
Once you hit a sit-down show the hosts get their mics wired in and just never f'ing move, lest they screw up the mics. Also getting a guest seated and wired in takes time, and they have to work with their guest's schedules too, so you do this interview before the show to make things more convenient for the guest and so you don't have to worry about getting everything perfect in the span of a single commercial break.
So they toss the footage over to an editor who cuts out any and all silent periods, maybe they'll eliminate a question or two to make the interview fit the [broadcast clock]( and kind of shift stuff around to make things more understandable ("this answer makes a whole lot more sense if you know the stuff he was talking about later").
Chances are this was only ever seen by one person before it ever hit the air, so this was probably just an error. Stuff like this happens all the time. Like talk shows (even the live ones) where they show the audience applauding? They shoot all that before the show starts and just play it out at the beginning and end of segments, that way they don't have to worry about getting a camera operator pointed over there, or any sound problems.

That comparison really doesn't mean much, since countries manipulate (or try to) their currency valuations all the time. Look at China and the Renminbi for example.
The only thing it's really good at being compared against right now are things like gold. Speaking of, the big reason I'd argue that BTC has strengthened against gold is simply because the price of Gold has dropped over $300/oz over the past 12 months, and more than $800/oz over the past four years.

I think what was trying to say is how do they get the Bitcoins in the first place, which is a valid concern. Mining is basically unprofitable to do on your own (even as part of a pool, the profitability is questionable) and you're still using fiat to pay for your electricity (so you're essentially converting fiat to crypto by way of your utility company). They could work for Bitcoin, but for the most point if they don't have access to cash then they likely aren't going to be able to do much work as they're likely existing in a subsistence lifestyle. Which leaves barter (coconuts).
But the bigger problem is if they don't have access to cash then how the hell are they going to have access to a cell phone? I'm picturing some old guy out in the middle of nowhere India, how is he going to scrape together the money to buy a cell phone and pay for the cell bill?
In this case he has to pay to have access to his money, which likely would lower his purchasing power more than if he just kept a wad of paper rupees in a box under his bed.
In more developed areas, it works pretty well, like huge parts of Africa where people are already using their cell phones to manage their finances. But for the most part physical banknotes are still far more accessible to those billions of unbanked people than Bitcoin simply because the barriers of entry to obtain, manage and hold cash are lower.

Yep, I'd say this is correct. The UK switched over from the old system of Pounds, Shillings and Pence to a Decimalized system, and folks adjusted. Not quite the same thing, but the NYSE used to quote everything in fractions, now it's decimalized. Canada and Europe switched from Imperial measurements to (mostly) metric.
I, myself, had to adjust to something like this. When I was in school and had to do any video engineering, everything was in Standard Definition, and was measured in [IRE]( Then when I started working on HD material everything was measured in millivolts. 700mV? WTF is that in IRE? Thankfully every piece of gear had both units on it at the time, so I could quickly adjust. Now it's just all mV for me, and whenever I see IRE listed in a spec sheet I know someone hasn't updated their documentation in a long time.
It's the big numbers part that'll throw people. Having to keep track of how many zeroes there are gets a little tricky after four or so. Folks might standardized on a sub-unit, kinda like the Satoshi, or they might just get used to scientific notation. 3.1×10^(9).

Agreed. It's not hard to do, you just pump a ton of noise out on a given frequency. Boom, done. In fact, that's why it's illegal to operate a full-sized spark-gap transmitter in the United States: it kicks out so much noise that it can interfere with radio services (cell service, wifi, car fobs, even TV and radio broadcasts) over a huge area.
It's also not as feasible in sparsely populated areas. The rural parts of the Western US is pretty spread out, and at that point we're probably talking about some kind of over-the-horizon communications network to connect to the nearest node, not to mention anything else that might interfere with someone's line of sight (like a big hill or something).

Are you saying there's some kind of breakthrough development in butt wiping that's being held back by ＢＩＧ　ＧＯＶＥＲＮＭＥＮＴ? Is ＢＩＧ　ＧＯＶＥＲＮＭＥＮＴ responsible for bidets not being more common in the western world?


Are you saying we need innovations in health insurance, in how health care is paid for? What innovations in paying for health care happened prior to the ACA that was stomped on by "socialism"?


I'm sorry, having migraines means I should be denied affordable care for a knee injury? I should have to pay extra for my migraine meds because I get migraines? What's the point of insurance if it doesn't pay for care? Who on this planet never gets injured ever? Never develops a chronic condition?
I skidded out taking a sharp turn on a sandy path and going just a smidge too fast. Why should I have to pay thousands of dollars more out of pocket to get my knee fixed, than if it were you? Just because I wake up with severe headaches if I go to bed without dinner? Just because red wine gives me a stabbing pain behind my eyes I should pay more for an unrelated injury?
No, man, your analogy is wrong. "Who would sell you fire insurance if you could buy it after someone broke into your car?" That's the analogy put more accurately.

Have you seen the intransigence of conservatives?
Abortion in pretty much all forms, [even to save the life of the mother]( was banned until recently.
Here in the US one of the people competing to be a Senator to represent my state argued that man-made climate change isn't real, and opposed anti-climate-change action because "[we cannot change the way the sun operates.](
Hell, less than ten years ago we took at stab at reforming our healthcare system. Even after The Public Option (allowing people to buy into existing government health insurance programs) was stripped out, even after Death Panels (reimbursing doctors for time spent talking to patients about living wills and advance care directives) were stripped out, even after state level Medicaid expansions were made optional (rather than mandatory), it was still derided as "SOCIALIST!!!!"
After its implementation it was blamed for ruining people's lives, with politicians parading around [families (purportedly) "hurt by Obamacare"]( despite the fact that many of them wouldn't have had health insurance without the ACA. They blamed increasing insurance premiums on the ACA, despite the fact that the rate of increase was lower than it had been prior to the implementation of the ACA. They even tried to blame the technical glitches of the ACA website during it's inaugural run as proof the ACA could never work, despite the fact that the only states that were impacted by these problems were the ones refusing to implement as much of the ACA as they could.
The entire Republican party campaigned to remove the ACA and dedicate itself to a "market-based" approach (though they never did explain WTF that means, given that the vast majority of people who gained insurance under the ACA gained it through the private insurance market).
Barring the total collapse of the Republican party and conservatives failing to establish any kind of political coalition to replace them as a power bloc, there is absolutely no way in hell this country will have universal healthcare by 2025. Especially when the President's loudest, most loyal, most active segment of the base is out there comparing universal healthcare to Stalinist collectivization.
Hell, there are segments of this country backsliding so much that it's no longer controversial to be a neo-Nazi. You'd think we never fought a war against them.

"Look, compared to other systems, here why it doesn't suck so bad."




That's not shopping around for "fire insurance," at that point it's shopping around for the cheapest fire department. Nobody has time to shop around in the case of an emergency. There's a difference between "insurance" and "emergency services," but you're just going to conflate the two?


BRB, going to start calling around to different charities to figure out which ones will help me pay for the ambulance I can't afford before I call them. Oh, and figuring out which ambulance provider will put me the least in debt. Don't mind the fact that I'm in blinding pain and the adrenaline pumping barely has me able to work my phone, I just need to make a few calls!


Uh, no. Government only mandates they provide health insurance if they're over 50 employees. We're a company of less than 15. Insurance is offered as an employment perk in a competitive industry.
That's not socialism, that's the free market. Like offering better pay.




Because that's the system you're advocating for. You're the one saying the "SOCIALISM" of the ACA is bad, and we need to return to a pre-ACA world. That's a world where I wouldn't have gotten insurance coverage for my knee injury.
You're advocating for a system where I'd have to pay thousands more for my knee injury than you would because porter brews cause me trouble.

[Have you seen our infant mortality rate]( Our healthcare system ain't that great.
ER docs first diagnosed me with a sprained knee. Brought me in, they were able to flex my knee (which hurt, *a lot more*, when they did it) no obvious bone damage, no nerve damage because I could feel all the way down to my toes, you know what they decided to do? Eh, let's give 'im an X-Ray. Gave me some ibuprofen, sold me some crutches, and sent me on my way.
I received six bills for my ER visit. One from the Emergency Room in the hospital, one from the subcontractor that ran the X-Ray, one from the subcontractor that sold me the crutches and the ibuprofen, and three from my insurance company (several weeks after the first round of bills) telling me what portion they'd pay for each bill. Oh, and parking, I was fortunate enough to have family living nearby, and they drove me to the ER, but they covered the parking costs. And Thank goodness they were there for me, because from what I understand from a friend who once had to avail himself of an ambulance, that would have set me back just shy of an additional $10,000.
After a week of being unable to support any weight on my knee, and still being in pain whenever I flexed it, I went and sought out the services of an orthopedic specialist. Thank goodness I have a family member who is a nurse, otherwise I wouldn't have known that it was an orthopedic specialist that I needed, as opposed to some other kind of specialist.
It would be another week before I could get an MRI, and a week after that before they could tell me what was going on. Four more bills: one for the MRI, one for someone to read the MRI and tell me what it said and to recommend a course of treatment, and two from the insurance company.
Now at this point it has been **four weeks** that I have been unable to walk. I had to borrow a family member's car because I couldn't work the clutch in mine. Thank goodness I had a job I could do while sitting down. I was rediagnosed with a torn ACL, partially torn MCL, torn meniscus, and damage to the bone that the initial X-Ray had not detected. They drained my knee of fluid, and set up an appointment for me to be fitted with a knee brace, the following week.
So **five weeks** on crutches, and insurance didn't fully cover my knee brace either. Two more bills for that one. Thank goodness I had family that could drive me to the ER, and that they could swap cars with me until I could put pressure on my knee again, rental cars would have been a bitch, and I'd risk having my own car be impounded if I just left it in the lot for several weeks.
And thank goodness I had an accommodating employer, who let me work from home when my schedule demanded it, and helped make accommodations so I could more safely get in and out of places around the building, and were just generally willing to help me out.
Oh, and thank goodness I had insurance, which would have otherwise been denied to me without the ACA because of my migraines and history of asthma, pesky pre-existing conditions, otherwise I would have been deep in the hole.
And this was not just some cosmetic thing, like getting braces, or getting a pair of prescription sunglasses, this was my ability to stand on my own two goddamn feet. My ability to climb stairs in a timely matter, to use a ladder, reach for things up high, and carry them on my own.
Five weeks before I got the care I needed to start to heal. About a dozen bills, totaling several thousands of dollars of pre-insurance value. Great system. Totally no inefficiencies and excessive overhead there! Free Market is doing an awesome job. "Hold on one sec, I have to call around to various emergency rooms while clutching my leg in agony to ensure I'm getting the best deal from the most highly rated doctors."

And there we have the most widely ignored and dismissed argument for things like universal healthcare.
Opponents of UHC paint supporters as "just wanting free stuff that isn't really free," when in reality I don't think there's a single person who's argued in favor of universal healthcare that hasn't recognized it is not free. For the most part everyone will pay for it, nobody is denying that.
The point isn't "free stuff," the point is about paying the lowest cost for the same services for the most people. It's about spending our money in the most efficient way possible. It's like buying in bulk.
I can go down to my local grocery store and get 2lbs of chicken for about $6. And we all can go to our preferred stores, and buy our own chickens. Some will pay $6, others pay $8, some may only pay $5. Or we can group together and go down to CostCo and buy one of those big things of multiple servings of chicken, all of us chip in, and split it up for a net cost of $3 for the same amount of chicken. And as an effect, my friend who may only have $4 can now afford to buy chicken.
It might *look like* we subsidized his chicken, like... [̲̅S̲̅][̲̅O̲̅][̲̅C̲̅][̲̅I̲̅][̲̅A̲̅][̲̅L̲̅][̲̅I̲̅][̲̅S̲̅][̲̅M̲̅], but who cares what it looks like? Everyone gets to eat chicken, and we're all paying less for it. We all come out ahead.

Yeah, I can understand the whole issue of clutter. My suggestion is a spin on what suggested. Simple text: "Cryptocurrencies accepted here," and then simply follow it up with smaller versions of whatever individual cryptocurrencies you prefer to patronize underneath, much as many companies handle social media. Typically it's `website.com/adcampaign` and beneath it are the logos for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.
This design has two advantages. One is that it emphasizes a support of *cryptocurrencies*, rather than *just* Bitcoin or *just* Litecoin. After all, five years from now who knows if Bitcoin will still be around. Some other cryptocurrency could rise up, having eliminated the majority of its problems (such as dust) and proven a number of advantages (like how Gridcoin contributes to BOINC projects).
The other major advantage is that you can continue to add 'coins to the list without making your design look too schizophrenic. It's just one more icon in the list. You could easily add half a dozen without causing too much clutter.

I'm aware of what they were, I just wasn't sure what the appropriate word to describe them was. I've always heard Kanji described as being a ideographic system.


Conceptually or aurally? No, they're not that different at all. I meant more in terms of how they're actually written. Granted, Kanji has connections to Hiragana, but it's still studying two different things. But Katakana is so aesthetically different from Hiragana that, syllabics aside, you basically are learning an entirely different set of characters.

A language with three radically different "alphabets" is pretty complicated. And in the end, what good is it to be able to speak the language if you can't read it and write it as well?


I wasn't trying to say one was better than another, I was trying to draw a parallel. Both Bitcoin and Esperanto are items invented to be independent of existing structures, and completely free of ties to any one nation. Both rely on more of a change to the way people behave in order to drive adoption, not greater development in technology.


Again, back to Cantonese: a German or French speaker wouldn't be able to pick up that language by sheer intuition alone either. And between Scandinavia, East Europe, Asia, and the Middle East there is a *huge* percentage of the global population that speak a first language that is completely divorced from the linguistic heritage of the Romance languages, so I fail to see how such a thing is even relevant.
And the interesting thing about your statement is that Esperanto's writing style is derived from a mix of Romantic and Germanic language origins. I recognize a lot of words from my studies of Spanish.


Define "good." As I said, it's fairly logical, it has an orderly system of prefixes and suffixes, it lacks *any* irregular verbs, and beyond that it's rather easy to write, and pronunciation is a pretty simple affair. I see nothing that would make it a "bad" language, but then again I fail to see how one could judge a language to be "good" or "bad" in the first place. Is Russian a "bad" language?


Esperanto has an estimated [two million Level-2 speakers]( and I think Klingon only numbers in the low hundreds of thousands/high tens of thousands.

Depends on how you define "work." I'm sure it's possible to successfully and reliably give people Bitcoin in exchange for their sensor data, but will it improve your data? I don't know.
In addition to the potential for abuse, which is discussed elsewhere in the thread, I'd be worried about additional complication in the interface. Is someone going to be required to set up the Bitcoin information in advance, which could make the thing more complicated to set up, or will it be hidden in a settings page (to potentially be missed by numerous people)?
I also might be concerned about potential tax issues. For instance, let's say I decided to take full advantage of your offer, and set up several phones throughout my region. I set up a phone at relatives' houses, friends' condos, the office, etc. and now I'm generating an amount of money that might be taxable in my area. Do you have any legal obligation to provide tax paperwork, and if so how do you manage that?
Before you consider that crazy, [consider what this guy is doing]( Definitely an outlier, and probably not too likely to happen on a mass scale, but it might be worth doing a quick CYA on this one. Probably worth doing a CYA on any international money transfer issues that might come up.


I guess to reduce complexity of the whole thing is you'd add a card to the intro that explains you can earn Bitcoin for this by entering a wallet address into the settings.
Logistically? I have no idea how many people would take you up on this offer, or what your funding situation is like, so I can't really guess as to how you'd manage this without going bankrupt.

But let's say that you build in a requirement that you must have GPS turned on for the app to work, rather than relying on cell tower trilateralization.

How so? I can't send you 10BTC and you can't then 10BTC to someone else?
I'd say that banks aren't rushing to support BTC because they don't need to, and it could be problematic.
Their business model works fine now, and it doesn't seem to be under imminent threat of collapsing, so they're going to wait and see what happens. Furthermore, it directly competes with some of their services (like money transfers), so supporting it doesn't really serve their core business at this time.
Then there's the legal issues that could crop up. Things like BitLicense, or potential regulation could make it unprofitable or illegal for them to be involved with BTC. In this case it's better to wait and see what happens with the law.
There also doesn't seem to be any demand for banks to support BTC. Right now most people involved with Bitcoin are almost militantly opposed to the banking industry (or at least as it is today; and at least it *sounds* like most people involved with Bitcoin, it could just be a case of a minority that's out-shouting everyone else) and don't sound like they'd use their services anyhow.

It also seems that based on that, there is also a nonzero chance that enough people will cash out and leave to seriously deflate the market, making it less viable for long-term use.
Furthermore, I'd call "future in doubt" an opinion, which generally doesn't get classified as "misinformation."

Well, I didn't mean that it's literally an additional fee on top of everything *just because it's a convenience* (like, say, TicketMaster charging you extra to print your own tickets at home), but more that people will pay the fee because it's more convenient to use an ATM. Like someone will pay the price mark-up at a local store because it's more convenient than waiting for it to be delivered from an online retailer. The price difference isn't just a "screw you" mark-up, it's because the retailer has to cover the cost of the physical store, while the online retailer does not. And so it is with the ATM: the fee covers the cost of buying the ATM, setting it up, putting together the network to support it, and servicing the ATM (fixing it, filling it with money, etc).

Exactly. It's a *convenience* fee. You're paying for the convenience of not having to schlepp down to a bank to withdraw money or check your balance. Just like you pay for the convenience of having UPS bring you a package rather than having to go and get it from the sender yourself.

I don't think this was BitPay being a “good guy,” as as it's them being calculating and smart.
If I'm oblivious to what Bitcoin is, why do I care about BitPay? Their business has nothing to do with me. *But* if they're teaching me about what Bitcoin is before telling me about their business then I'm going to be far more interested and likely to employ their services.
This was just smart, and I'm sure they figured that in the course of their research consumers might be pulled into other processors, like CoinBase, but a rising tide lifts all boats, and it'll be easier to tempt people from a competitor than to convince people they need a service they don't understand. And even then, there are people who will probably not need BitPay's services, but will still get into Bitcoin, which helps BitPay's business (the more people who use Bitcoin, the more demand there will be for a processor).

But the problem is that now you've got the Mozilla foundation deciding not only that its consumers *want* a Bitcoin wallet, but possibly that it's making the political decision to *encourage* its use. And since most governments haven't yet decided what to do with Bitcoin (is it handled like a currency? A piece of property?) that's an awkward position to put the Mozilla Foundation into, since that then puts a bit of an onus on them to educate people as to what Bitcoin is, and how to legally handle it under their local laws. That's a *huge* undertaking right there, and likely a mess that the Mozilla Foundation *doesn't* want to get into.
Beyond that, it could even be detrimental to getting Firefox OS into the hands of more people. If a Bitcoin wallet were baked into the OS, that could create legal issues, say, selling a phone with FFOS in Thailand, [where Bitcoin is banned]( So it's introducing a whole other aspect that could effect the appeal of FFOS to handset manufacturers, and thus Mozilla's ability to get FFOS into the hands of people. Now, you *could* fork the OS into Bitcoin-enabled and Bitcoin-disabled builds, but now you've got a whole new mess on your hands: managing *two* versions of the OS. This adds a whole new level of complication in testing, since you would need to have people testing the built-in Bitcoin infrastructure (which, assuming they aren't involved in using Bitcoin in their every day lives, would mean that the testers would need to incur transaction fees for simply passing money back and forth).
It's also putting the Mozilla Foundation into the position of "blessing" Bitcoin as *the* cryptocurrency. Sure, it's the one with the most mainstream awareness, but the market has spoken, and Litecoin and Dogecoins are things people are buying into. Who says that Mozilla should be deciding which cryptocurrency people want?
Beyond that, what about if people *don't* want the built-in Bitcoin wallet? Let's say they aren't interested in it, or want to use a different wallet (like Coinbase, for example). Now they're stuck with this extra hunk of embedded code that they can't just arbitrarily delete. They're stuck with it, whether they want it or not.
There are many reasons *not* to bake Bitcoin into the OS, but so far the only reason to do so are political, and I don't think the Mozilla Foundation wants to get into that, especially when, globally, they only have a handful of phones on the market (most of them in the possession of developers).


Actually, this is how *all* apps are handled in Firefox OS. All apps are bits of HTML5/JS that are linked to icons on the home screen. There are no “native” apps, so web apps are supposed to blend fluidly into the use of the phone.

Not necessarily, since upload bandwidth isn't consumed while streaming. Also typically there's a simple button in the player to downgrade the stream by one peg, instead of fiddling with the number if inbound/outbound connections and raw bandwidth numbers. Most people probably don't even know how much bandwidth they have, let alone how much is consumed by an individual stream.
And even beyond that: turning down your download speed means you have to wait longer to get your file. Turning down your streaming speed just reduces the fidelity, not the immediacy.

Most of the big banks have networks of ATMs established, and it used to be that if you ever withdrew cash from an out-of-network ATM you were charged a fee. Some banks specifically advertised their ATMs as fee-free, whether you were a member of that bank or not. Some banks also have agreements with each other not to charge fees for each other's members. There also are some independent networks, like Allpoint, that operate interbank networks (which connect ATMs) which banks may become a member of, rather than having to establish their own network of ATMs (this is what the local one-branch credit union does).
ATM can also be privately owned, often by a shop or a restaurant, for their customer's convenience (though there is a slim minority of establishments that will do business in cash-only, and operate an on-site ATM). These ATMs usually don't have a bank's name on it, and are smaller than your typical ATM. If you were charged a withdrawal fee by an ATM, there's a good chance you used one of these. These also tend to be the ATMs with the highest fees.

I don't see that as being the case. I see it as either Bitcoin particularly appealing to a larger portion of libertarians/anti-government folk than the rest of the general population, thus meaning they make up a larger portion of the users of Bitcoin; or as either because they have a political opinion on the whole thing becoming the louder portion of the community, perhaps disproportionately to their population as a percentage of Bitcoin users.
And you know what, that's fine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I see nothing inherently wrong with holding libertarian ideals or questioning the government. That's all an important part of political discourse in any civilization. What I find a bit off-putting is that this subreddit is "devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem," as quoted in the sidebar.
IMHO, the pervasiveness of people to up/down vote posts based on whether or not it agrees with their political opinions (as opposed to whether or not it contributes to the discourse) really makes the entire subreddit feel really unwelcoming and really brands Bitcoin, as a phenomenon, as being a political (trending towards anti-government) thing, *especially* here on Reddit. (Cue the downvotes because people disagree) Just as the SJWs brand Tumblr as being a site full of teens and tweens who feel a sense of entitlement and misunderstand the world around them, and how the zealousness of Open Source engineers has given Linux the sheen of being only for neckbeards who fix every bug they find themselves.
Sure, Bitcoin raises a lot of questions about the role of government in commerce and the flow of money, those discussions are going to be inevitable, but the overt politicking with posts like this one just *really* leave a sour taste in my mouth (well, if the first half of my comment didn't earn me downvotes, here's my second try, I guess). It lumps the whole subreddit in with other groups that hold anti-government opinions, despite the fact that I'd wager the anti-government crowd here probably isn't the majority.

Two crazy ideas:
1. In order to qualify for Bitcoin payment you most provide some evidence that your device is real (maybe a photograph of the serial number, along with some registration details).
1. Provide people with an "Approved Platform" that they can use. Sell, for a nominal fee, a small device that will measure the barometric pressure information and report it back, perhaps a kit built on the Raspberry Pi or Intel Edison or something, or just a little USB dongle or something. People can then buy as many of these as they want and set them up wherever they wish (so you could set up one up at your house, your cabin, at the office, your relative's place, etc), but you're only paid for one device per IP address (so you can buy like 20 of them and keep them in your closet).

Yes. I just advise patience whenever people have wishes for anything Valve-related. The company moves so slow that if it weren't for the money Steam was bringing in I doubt they'd still be alive today.


It's *slightly* more than that, since they've got some kind of agreement with bundling proprietary drivers. That's it's biggest selling point.


Yes, that much is nice. But they're hardly pinning themselves into a hole. The idea was that the Steam Machines would always be commodity hardware, which any manufacturer could build using any parts, making the platform rather future-proof.


See, I disagree. What they're trying to do is lure console gamers away from their consoles. Once you have them on a PC, even one masquerading as a console, then you can slowly peel back the layers, guiding them to ascension.
That being said, there are some games that just work better with controllers, IMHO. I'd rather play racing games with a controller than a keyboard and mouse, and when you're playing a platformer (like *BattleBlock Theater*, or *Lego Marvel Superheroes* for example) or something that plays like one (say *Dungeon Defenders*, *Bit Trip Runner*, or *Edge*) it's nice to lean back with the controller for that kind of stuff.


Your guess is as good as mine.


Not possible. GabeN hasn't learned to count to three yet.


It's still pretty un-friggin-acceptable that they've let it languish for so long, though.

For Bitcoin? I think it'll be inevitable. They accept PayPal, and they've just started doing gift cards in the past year (but only in GameStops and Best Buys, and only in the United States). If there's one thing Valve likes, it's money, and given that Steam is their biggest money maker (doubly so when you consider all the Market stuff that goes on for F2P games like Dota 2) I'm sure they'll eventually expand their purchasing options to include it. I'm also pretty sure we'll see it pop up much like Microsoft is handling it: you purchase either prepaid credit with Bitcoin, or just in a direct translation to the local currency (a la buying Reddit Gold) rather than buying with all prices in BTC.

Streaming is still more convenient. You don't have to go find the torrent, you don't have to make sure you're downloading one you can play (that is, downloading an HD video when you can only handle SD, or `MP4`-wrapped vs `MKV`-wrapped), or manage your storage space and downloaded videos, or wait for it to finish. You also don't have to worry about managing your bandwidth to ensure you don't choke the router (or suck up all the bandwidth so no one else can use the Internet), or clean up the finished downloads out of your client.
You just click and play. Everything is handled for you.
Of course, this assumes that you're getting the video when it's new. Getting something without a lot of seeders can take days. Or weeks even.

What? I remember using MMS over 2G connections *long* before 3G service was available anywhere in ConUS. MMS is widely available and was heavily utilized for sending ringtones, games, images, video, and Vcards over 2G networks.
Consider how long it took T-Mobile to get into building out a 3G network.  They didn't even light up their first UMTS tower until 2008. They wouldn't have been able to maintain any subscriber base at all if they didn't have features as basic as MMS.
Many MMS services just have a cap of 300KB per message, a payload that EDGE or 1xRTT can easily handle.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:05:29

That's true, but what his point of view is that for the most part Bitcoin isn't being *used* as one, it's being used as a way of transmitting funds, like PayPal or Western Union. And to some degree, that is true, though the exact number of people using it in that way isn't entirely known.
Though I'd still agree with him. Investing in Bitcoin to try and turn a profit sounds like a bad idea. Not as a concept, but because Bitcoin's value is rather volatile. It used to be $1,000/BTC, and then it dropped like a stone. It's a risky investment, especially given all the legal ambiguities. How many times did the value of BTC relative to USD jump around based on the statements of someone with an official sounding title in China says something? Or because some US agency is doing something relative to Bitcoin? Or a darknet market goes down?
Those are all unpredictable things that could cause a huge loss of money. If you're going to invest in Bitcoin (financially or emotionally) do so because you support it, not because you think it's a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're trying to make money you're better off getting into micro-lending or something.

I'll give you the ELI5 explanation since that's about as far as my knowledge extends. 
Bitcoin is a currency that operates using a decentralized network. Coins are generated by processing cryptographic algorithms, which both prevents counterfeiting and at the same time is used to process transactions. The resulting generator data is stored in what's called the Blockchain. You store your Bitcoins in a “wallet,” which basically is just an address.

Those exist. Most wallets for smartphones are pretty easy to use (though effort seems almost entirely contained to Android and iOS; I don't see any Firefox OS wallets, or J2ME wallets, which are far more prevalent in developing nations, which are big in the mobile commerce realm) and many hosted wallets (Coinbase comes to mind) are remarkably easy to use. Most of them have the option to handle transactions in a local currency (USD, CAD, JPY, etc) without you needing to do the calculations yourself.
A bigger problem is for brick-and-mortar merchants that might want to quote prices in BTC. As the market is relatively volatile prices change on a daily basis, which means the price they put on their goods and services changes daily as well. This is also an issue for consumers because you can't rely on a price quote from the previous day, making large purchases tricky of plan for.
The problem is volatility. Prices for goods and services are pegged to the local currency, as are most peoples' finances, meaning that you *have* to convert every time. It's the same issue travelers experience when going abroad: they have to be converting prices constantly to ensure they aren't be ripped off.

Isn't that kind of the way it should be? Do we really want the mods to be deciding who should and shouldn't be able to post in here? Labeling someone is a troll and summarily ban them? I've said stuff around here that was downvoted to oblivion because people didn't like my opinion, should *I* be banned? It's not hard to label me a troll after the fact because one of the mods decided they just didn't like me. **Edit:** not to say anything negative about the moderators here, merely an example of how a policy on banning trolls *could* be abused.
Some of the best subreddits I've been in have moderators with a mostly hands-off approach, deleting comments or banning people only for major infractions (posting of personal information, posting illegal stuff, scamming, spamming, or anything against Reddit's formal rules). Sure, they get trolls, but they always get downvoted.
If it bothers you that much install [RES]( and start adding people to your Ignore list. Et voila: you don't see the trolls and the moderators can remain hands off.

Voting works in general, yes. Look at for a good example.


does something like this, they engage in tone policing. People would go in there and say something unpopular, or disagree with a mod, or just plain be misunderstood, resulting in them getting banned, which alienated a huge portion of their subscribers. That prompted the creation of &gt; At the same time (other) people whine how bad this subreddit is.
I think the reason for that isn't because of people like but people who feel that disagreeing with someone is a license to use the downvote button. People who think dissenting opinions need to be quashed. It makes the whole subreddit look hostile and it stifles real discussion.
And discussions that do happen almost always get too political, devolving into an anti-government circle jerk, where implying even the most tacit approval of any form of taxation or regulation of any kind, people ignore everything else you've said and resort to hurling insults and making personal attacks. Again, makes the subreddit look hostile and intolerant.


I completely disagree. I think the mods are doing a fantastic job. They let the community do its thing. I've gotten in disagreements in comment threads with the mods and because of how hands-off they are I've never felt like I was bucking for the ban hammer.
That makes people feel very free to speak their mind, like they don't need to self-censor (lest they be censored anyway and banished from the subreddit).

Most likely it'll never see the light of day outside of Xeon and some server-grade (ECC supporting) Pentiums for the low-power server field, and a few Core-i chips for business-grade laptops.
This stuff has been around for decades, the point is to allow IT guys to be able to do things like remotely power cycle hung machines, or serve up a disk image as a virtual CD, or check the machine's current temperature at various locations within the chassis. Typical IT deployment has these on a whole separate management network to keep it out of users' hair. Having used it before it's tremendously helpful.

That's not what the article says. Nowhere does it say that he was *not* contacted by the FCC, only that he said "Proxyham devices did not break the FCC standards as the 900MHz antennas were capped at the 1-watt limit."
This is the same kind of answer you get when you're being prosecuted for any kind of legal violation. You maintain that you were operating within the bounds of the law until a court finds otherwise, and then you shut up about everything else. You don't concede you broke the law when you're fighting prosecution or fines.


That doesn't mean the FCC *isn't* involved. Update 2 reads:

This presentation, though, specifically touches on operating in a pure P2P way, without third party intervention (e.g. accounts cannot be frozen). They also mention setting up desktop and mobile wallets.
Since they touch on those points they really ought to be mentioning that *if* they're handing their own software for wallet management then these are things that need to be mentioned. You can just download a copy of Bitcoin-QT and then never update it. Likewise you shouldn't be running a mobile wallet without maintaining a backup, or only keeping part of your funds in there (to protect against unexpected hardware failure or theft of the phone).
The point is they touched on the advantages and disadvantages of accepting government-backed currency, and then only talked about the advantages of Bitcoin, but none of the disadvantages. It's a very lopsided view that doesn't give an accurate picture of what they're talking about.
Now, in the actual presentation they would give in person, that's where they would touch on how trivial some of this stuff might be, or if the risk of a disadvantage is just as high as it is with cash (e.g. stolen wallet/phone), but there isn't even a slide that brings any of that up.

Bingo. My guess is the FCC sent them a nastygram over non-compliance, and the devs currently have their lawyers on the job. FCC fines accrue for every day of non-compliance, so they trashed all their units to cover their ass in case they lose this fight, and their layers told them to keep their mouth shut lest they say something that could get them in more hot water. It's like getting prosecuted for corruption or something like that: you continue to say what you did was legal, and then you shut your mouth and don't say anything else.

The 900 MHz band isn't *completely* open for unlicensed use. It's still regulated and there are still restrictions on the ERP for devices within that spectrum. While the transciever's power may be limited to 1 watt (30dBm) the extremely directional Yagi antenna they're using most certainly has a gain higher than 6dBi (which is about as high as you can get with a 1W transmitter and still be compliant), especially if they're claiming it functions over *miles*. If you look at [the data sheet for the antenna they show in use]( ^(*PDF warning!*) you can see that the gain is more than *twice* that, which puts them way outside spec for unlicensed use, especially if they built more than five (which it sounds like they did). So unless [their pictures]( showed them using something other than the devices they were producing, there is absolutely no way it was FCC compliant.

Generally, when there are people going back and forth about Bitcoin itself, as a technology, things usually get hashed out in a fairly civil way.

*They* claim they're not violating the FCC regs, that doesn't mean the FCC isn't claiming they are. Seems far more likely to me that they pissed off the FCC and their lawyers are currently going at it, hence the radio silence on the issue. They aren't going to say, “yes, it is non-compliant,” while they're arguing with the FCC that it's not.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:13:29


That's still entirely his claim. What does the FCC have to say about this?


Because he wants to dodge attention for having fouled up somewhere else, and this serves as a distraction? Because his lawyer told him to say absolutely nothing other than to deny wrongdoing? There's plenty of possibilities. I'm inclined to trust the EFF's lawyer, who seems to know something about how all this stuff works, when he says that it's implausible that an NSL was issued.

That has to do with the legalities of a fax. Since faxes don't involve some kind of intermediate server reading your message in order to relay it to its destination it's considered point-to-point, and therefore a legal way transmit signatures on documents.


That has more to do with the way modern phone systems work, since it's being transcoded lossily about a half dozen times en route.
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:03:13
Well, the legal difference is that the phone company doesn't have to read your entire message to pass it on. This is where we get into the difference between packet switched networks and circuit switched networks.
For something on the phone network, which is circuit switched, there's just that header way up in the front that says "I'm reaching 604-555-1212" so all the phone gear has to do is reroute the whole stream to its destination. The idea for Fax security here is that were someone to interrupt that continuous stream it would show up as an obvious anomaly in the received fax.
For something on the Internet, which is packet switched, the idea is that since each server along the way has to read a whole packet in order to route it to its destination, it is more easily seamlessly altered en route than something that is circuit switched.
So on the extreme end the idea is that I could go to your ISP's nearest node to you, and start capturing packets and seamlessly editing them and retransmitting them to say whatever I want, and since TCP isn't as sensitive to changes in timing, unlike a circuit switched network, I can take the time I need to make all the changes I want without the person on the receiving end knowing.

Exactly my thoughts. Once banks start handling legal marijuana business' needs undoubtably more than a few of them will step back and say, "wait a minute: new customers want to deal in USD, most of my vendors want to deal in USD (and credit cards), I'm paying (most, if not all) of my employees in USD, and for accounting and taxes I'm dealing in USD. Why don't I just cut out the (relatively volatile) middle man, and just deal in straight USD?"
After all, a business might prefer to outsource securing their cash (having a bank handle it) rather than have to deal with it themselves. After all, that's a big reason why most businesses don't deal 100% in cash and keep it all in a huge vault of their own. They don't want to buy a vault, maintain a vault, worry whether or not employees are properly securing the vault, it's just easier to have someone else do it.

In Vimeo's defense, they've had the infrastructure for accepting credit cards for many years. I don't know how much demand they've had in the past for Bitcoin as a payment option for Vimeo Plus.

Which is an opinion independent of Bitcoin. Not to say that I think regulation of Bitcoin is good, but it's an opinion that OP would hold, whether Bitcoin existed or not.


And I follow that line of reasoning. It's logical, and makes sense. However I feel like the content OP is linking to should be able to stand on its own, with its own contextual link to Bitcoin. It shouldn't need an "MRW" or "MFW" heading.
In fact, I feel this post in its entirely is more appropriate in than political and philosophical opinions aside.


Fair enough. I suppose that was a bit of a non-sequitur, if you haven't read that part of the thread.


Well, I'd disagree on that. I think if content can draw, on its own, a contextual link to the purpose of the subreddit then it is relevant. But that's just my opinion.


I think this is one point on which we can both agree. I'd rather the mods not get involved and let the community sort out what they'd like to see on their own. I feel that some of the best subreddits in existence are those where mods interfere sparingly with the content of the subreddit, and I say that as someone who moderates a subreddit.
Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't express our opinions on the content, hence how we've ended up here. And I appreciate that you've been quite even-keeled in this bit of back-and-forth. We disagree but neither of us have stooped to insulting each others' intelligence or personal lives. About as low as I feel either of us have gotten is debating how we've framed the context of this post, which is itself a valid point of debate.

As I understand it, Litecoin's claim to fame is that it is easier to mine. That doesn't exactly make it sound like a good investment

So don't use Overstock or TigerDirect, then. They're locked down and centralized businesses. And that's what Coinbase is, a business. Please point out a decentralized business. No one is *forcing* you to use them.

Yup! It's the cheapest way to send packages back and forth. So cheap that even UPS and FedEx are starting to rely on them for parts of the shipping chain, like [FedEx SmartPost]( In fact, I think FedEx and UPS are actually their biggest clients.

There are, in fact, Bitcoin wallets for Android that do just this, like [this one]( or [Coinbase's app](

They also seem to have forgotten about cash.

Can you explain this for me? Because FPGAs are supposed to be reconfigurable. So if you have an FPGA you *should* be able to rekajigger the thing to a circuit design that will handle Scrypt. Or am I missing something?

They won't. As long as people believe in PeTA they'll accept donations. It turns a decent transaction fee, I'm sure.

I thought most still used a reasonable amount of electricity, but it was their efficiency that made them attractive?

In my world LTC means Linear Timecode (as opposed to Vertical Interleave Timecode, or VITC). I'm assuming this context means Lightcoin? Is that actually a thing these days?

Because you aren't guaranteed to get a single Bitcoin, no matter how long you're mining. It's a race to see who cracks the next block. You're more likely better off going the other way.
