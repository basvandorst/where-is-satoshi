Portugal. They decriminalized all drugs in 2001 and not only did crime rates plummet, but drug use went down as well. Instead of putting all that money into police and jails, they put the money into social assistance programs and mental health. And everything is much better now.

Apples and oranges. You're comparing a payment processing company (Paypal) with a currency (bitcoin). A better comparison would be between Paypal and perhaps Bitpay. In this comparison, both are companies you can file a report with if there's any issues with a transaction.

Imagine you have some coins in your pocket. You take a quarter, paint it red, and announce to everyone that whoever holds this special red quarter can redeem it at any time for an ice cream cone. You then sell this red quarter for $1 to someone.
Colored coins are like that, but instead of quarters they are fractions of bitcoin, and instead of ice cream they're usually shares, deeds, or other financial implements.

What alternative payment methods are there? Are there any non\-corporate \(Visa, Mastercard\) payment solutions that the government is suggesting people use instead of cash? Wouldn't it be illegal for the government to force someone to give business to a private company just to purchase something?

On the receiving phone (seller/merchant) open mycelium and tap the receive button and type the amount owed. Then hold the sellers phone back to back with the buyer's phone and it will ask the seller confirmation to push to beam. The buyer's phone will them automatically open mycelium and will ask for confirmation to send the requested amount of bitcoins  to the specified address. Click send, and it's done!

Google still won't let you add it to your portfolio, so I wouldn't yet call it fully functional.

I spent some Bitcoin here last weekend during a Bitcoin Crawl with a friend. He wrote about the experience here:

Why is the transaction/miner fee still 0.1 mBTC?

That sounds like plenty to me. Ideally you would connect your game console, bluray player, and whatever other devices directly to your home theater receiver and then run a single HDMI cable from the receiver to the TV. As a bonus you'll get better audio that way as well.

I'm fairly certain almost everyone here is currently either a contractor with an hourly rate, or a full time employee with an annual salary. Yet contractors are not paid every hour, and full time employees thankfully don't have to wait a full year between paychecks. Who came up with the standard 2 weeks payday anyway? Why not make it daily or hourly instead? It doesn't have to be dependent on exactly what you did that hour - just have it be exactly a 1 hour slice of your annual salary. I think it would be nice to have a stable and steady stream of income instead of waiting for the next 2 week payday.

I'm really excited about the new NFC functions. Can you go into a bit more detail here? Also, thanks very much for allowing customizable fees!

I believe Mycelium supports NFC transfers as of version 2.1 (December 2014).

You need something like Bitstamp when other currencies such as USD are involved. However if you're staying completely within the Bitcoin blockchain, services like Bitstamp are not needed.

I don't have much voting power as I am merely a node operator and have no mining power, however I'm all for both Segwit and BU. I'll signal for whichever one is more likely to happen first, just to get this drama behind us.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:38:55
How does BU block segwit activation? Can't the two co-exist? If BU activates first, wouldn't it be wise for the core developers to add BU support to Core and continue marching towards segwit activation?

Most places will let you specify the tip amount on their tablet before it generates the QR code. Then as soon as you send the transaction it considers the bill paid immediately, without waiting for any confirmations. In this case I assume it's the payment processor like BitPay that takes any risk.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:54:04
We need it large enough to bring down transaction fees and clear the mempool, but small enough that it remains reasonably inexpensive to run a full node for decentralization. 2mb would meet both of those requirements.

Sadly, despite hundreds of food carts in Portland I'm not aware of a single one that currently takes Bitcoin. I don't understand why it isn't more popular with the cash-only carts who don't want to have to pay credit card fees.

You call a 400% gain in less than a week, vegetative?

Same. I considered running 0.12 RC3 just to show support in charts like this, but figured the final release version would be out any day. I except to see a substantial increase in 0.12 nodes soon after final release.
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:34:16
If the statistics in Core are to be trusted, my full node transfers around 80 GBytes per week, and that's mostly upload not download. For those poor souls with data caps, running a full node is probably out of the question. That said, I would continue to run a full node even with a block size increase.

Not true at all. He was never charged with anything related to this. And there never were any "hitmen", only corrupt federal agents.

It looks like CNBC is using Verizon math. Both the article and video incorrectly claim that Bitcoin was worth "0.003 cents" in 2010, when in fact it was worth $0.003.

I run one of the few IPv6 full nodes out there, and have over 100 active peer connections at the moment. Glad I can help!
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:33:18
The only "evidence" came from corrupt agents who are currently spending 70+ months behind bars each. It's legitimacy should be questioned at the very least - especially since there never was any victim.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:34:09
No, the total amount is correct. They're just saying 0.003 cents per Bitcoin when they really mean 0.003 dollars.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:40:47
It was a setup, pure and simple. Both the "hitman" and the "victim" which the hitman offered to kill were *both* corrupt federal agents working together to extort money from Ross.

Your link does not address my idea of verifying the behavior of a full node by watching it's contributions.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:30:09
Extortion is also illegal, and that's what the federal agent was attempting to do. If there was no extortion, there would never have been any thought of a hitman to solve that problem. Entrapment.

However to an A/V enthusiast, your 2gig 720p mkv file looks and sounds like crap. It doesn't have the original DTS-HD surround sound track and the video stream has been compressed to 1/20th of it's original quality. The only way to get subjectively "good" quality content right now is those 50GB blu-ray discs.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:20:24
I think criticisms of irreversibility are also misguided, as they compare a currency to a private payment network. Think of the US dollar in physical form - if you give a homeless guy on the corner a $20 bill and he runs off with it, is that reversible? So the USD and Bitcoin in their pure form are similar in this regard. It's only when you add a payment network run by a private company on top of the currency that you get reversible transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:18:10
Why is it difficult to prove whether a node on the network is a full node and is contributing? Isn't this a similar problem to one that BitTorrent solved? If I recall correctly, BitTorrent keeps track of which blocks it has sent to which peers, and looks to see those peers share out those same blocks to others in order to know that it is a full contributing node on the network worth sending more blocks to.
@_date: 2016-07-18 18:39:59
If you don't have the whole blockchain yourself, your only other option is to trust someone else who does. Who do you trust? The beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't *have* to trust anyone else.

In my opinion 0.0001 is still way too high. Why should it cost ~5 cents for a single Bitcoin transaction?

For anyone curious, if the total number of Bitcoins were split evenly among the population of earth, we would have approximately 3 mbits each. (0.003 BTC)

You could even describe his service as "gift wrapping" - but perhaps this is an epidemic that needs to be cracked down on every year around this time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:25:42
In the past, even during the 0.0005 BTC fee, transactions used to cost under 1 cent. The fee decreases obviously have not kept up with the rise in Bitcoin value and I think this needs to change. So I'm glad to hear they're working on making them dynamic, but what the fees end up becoming still remains to be seen.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:48:38
This works well with the standard QT client, but unfortunately there are some other clients out there that aren't as flexible. Mycelium for example currently enforces 0.0001. Hopefully this will change when the core Bitcoin protocol adopts a dynamic transaction fee or whatever other solution they come up with.
@_date: 2013-10-18 02:40:30
That sounds exactly like BitPay.
