Man, do I envy your broadband competition. 10 years ago I had 3/1 for $50 a month. Now I have 7/1 for $80 (and I couldn't pay for better speeds if I wanted to  short of getting a second DSL line and merging them).

A week ago someone at the call center I work at sent out an email to everyone at the site with all of this quarters financial data broken down by contract for all of our sites across North America. Surprisingly I'm being paid about half of what they get from the clients for me to be there evrey month, which is a smaller margin than I expected. 
Of course whoever sent the email tried the recall trick, but then only management uses Outlook. All us peons are stuck using an old version of Lotus.

Its usefull in Canada and I'm sure in a lot of other countries as well. Online poker is still legal here, however most banks and credit card companies started blocking transfers to poker sites around the same time the US banned them.
