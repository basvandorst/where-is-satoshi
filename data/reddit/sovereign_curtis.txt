1 hour for small-blockers to put forth the *most likely* worst-case scenario if the blocksize is changed.
1 hour for large-blockers to put forth the *most likely* worst-case scenario if the blocksize remains unchanged.
Then one hour to tear apart each other's predictions of doom.
Let's just get it out there. Maybe then we can see that the fear is just loosely based upon reality and we can all move on to making bitcoin great again.

Look, you're just throwing out assumptions that the captive population are willing participants. You've even gone so far as to claim this is something "we" all agree to, prior to something happening.
So let's talk about that.
When are children given the educated choice to join the American Society or not?
Because the way I see it no one is ever given an educated choice. You're born, you're told you're an American, and being an American is exceptional. You go to school, where you're indoctrinated into the mythos of the ruling class, and convinced that it is your **civic duty** to participate. This is around 11 years old. At 16 you get your first piece of government ID. And if you're a guy, at 18 you're not met with a "Congrats on being an adult. Would you like to voluntarily join our society and be a full citizen?". No, you're met with "If you don't sign up for the Selective Service in the next 30 days we're coming after you".
So again, tell me how we were all given the free and informed choice on whether or not to join and support the US Government.

As others have said try to slow down just a bit.
And I think you could improve the last third or so of the presentation. You seemed to lose some of your steam, and you failed to bring the presentation to a climax. I think the build-up should be all about the history of bitcoin, and what's happening around the world, and then ramp up your enthusiasm to explain what's going on in India, specifically with your company. Focus on how easy you're making bitcoin for the average Indian(?). And really slow down and be proud when you mention that ZebPay will be giving away 50 rupees in bitcoin to anyone who signs up with "ILoveBitcoin".

The difference is you're trying to determine if BitWage is hiding some premium in their pricing. Yet you have no clue what data source they use to generate their spot price. For all you know they use the global average and you're comparing it to BitStamp which is like 5% of global volume. What makes BitStamp the benchmark?!?
If I see someone quoting the Global Weighted Average and I see someone quoting BitStamp, its the person quoting the GWA that has more authority. You might as well be quoting LakeBTC.

The advantage of coins isn't that price floor you're imagining.
Its that they're far more trusted and liquid than bars/bullion. US coins with face values have known quantities and purities of precious metals. A buyer only has to check to make sure you haven't shaved/clipped the coin to know he/she is getting what they're paying for.

Are you talking about node operators?
Many do so out of altruism. Or because they believe supporting the network is supporting their own investment in the network. Some operators are large companies who profit from in the bitcoin ecosystem. We can expect that number to grow, **if** the bitcoin economy grows. To me that seems far more sensible than relying upon early adopters to run a full node out of a sense of altruism for the next 10, 100, 1000 years.


I don't think your analogy applies here, at all. The 1MB block limit was not baked into the protocol, as was the bitcoin token limit. It was never meant to be a permanent fixture or solution. And keeping it in place does nothing to alleviate the "problem" of the poor node operators.
What it does do is make bitcoin far less useful than it could otherwise be.

Getting an attorney is no replacement for knowing the law, yourself. Many attorneys are nothing more than Plea-Baggers, resting on their cozy relationships with judges and the DA to join in on the fleecing of the accused. I learned this the hard way when I was 19 and trusted the attorney I was paying $7500 to at least give me advice that was in my best interest. Nope. The asshole convinced me to plead guilty to the one charge out of three that will follow me for the rest of my life. At sentencing the judge didn't even look at me. He handed out "18 months probation, 5-6 months suspended sentence" like it was candy. I only saw **one** person get a different sentence.
Since then I'll either represent myself or find a competent **trial** lawyer. And competent trial lawyers are few and far between. When 95%+ of all cases get settled with a plea deal, the vast majority of lawyers don't even have the necessary experience to go to trial. Its disgusting.

Its not too late to order your share of the 100k Plan ฿ brochures we're currently giving away to US and Canadian bitcoin activists! We've shipped ~25k and have ~75k to go, and we want to get these into as many hands as possible. Just head on over to our website and fill out the form! 
Edit: Please do not request more than 100 unless you are ordering on behalf of other bitcoin activists. 50-100 per person should last 90+ days easily. If you order more than 100 you're creating more work for me, as I then need to contact you to see if you really need the requested amount, as 20+% more brochures have been requested than are being produced, and we want to make sure everyone who wants some gets some. So if you're only ordering for yourself, please just request 100.

You see, bitcoin atm manufacturers dont give away their equipment. They're actually in the business of generating a profitable income. So too are the investors of bitcoin atms. They look at the total cost of owning and operating a bitcoin atm and say "will this thing eventually pay for itself, and generate a profit?". If the answer is yes, then you see bitcoin atms being deployed. If the answer is no, then no bitcoin atm for you.

I could be wrong. Perhaps the same bitcoin can be recycled back and forth to accomplish the same payment network. But the lower the price, the less value available inside the entire network. That means if a Western Union like company uses bitcoin to move value around, they need more bitcoin to handle the same volume of value. Now consider that at a price of ten cents a bitcoin, most people aren't going to be selling, so its not going to be easy for the company to get their hands on, say $100MM worth of bitcoin.

Hey there cryptodude1.
Unless you're ordering for 10 more bitcoin activists, 1k brochures is overkill. These aren't simple handouts you can just give to people that walk by. They're an actual promotional tool that assist you in talking to the bit-curious over 10 - 30 minutes. Alone these won't convince anyone of bitcoin.

I like your math, but I think something is wrong.
If that one building is 5% of the total network, then once completed their eight buildings will be 30+% of the network. If true, then your statement about it being hard for government to attack bitcoin is very much false.
The OP says (emphasis mine):


So what is the "facility"? That one building? The two that are supposedly up and running? The four they've broken ground on? The eight they're planning to build?
Edit: Even if it's eight such buildings to account for 5% of the current network hashing power, that means a government only needs to build 80 - 100 such buildings to wage a 51% attack. I think its fair to say this would prove to be quite easy to either the United States or China. The only issue would likely be chip supply, so maybe one or the other builds one or more of their own chip factories, as well.
Double Edit: I'm not even sure China would need to build the buildings. They could just use one of the cities that have been built but are sitting empty, and fill every apartment with mining rigs.
Triple Edit: The U.S. could convert Detroit.
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:15:09
Maybe so, but it is not any less true. I've completed many face to face transactions by advertising on localbitcoins, and there is no incentive or ease in the buyer leaving me positive feedback.

Far fetched and desperate? Are you saying people do **not** tip 5, 10, 20 doge which are worth, at best, a whole penny? Afaik the minimum bitcoin tip is 25 cents. So who cares if doge supporters have been tipping a fraction of a penny back and forth for days and weeks? Try tipping someone a penny in the real world and see where that gets you.

Probably because you're now judging the brochure design in the context of this guy cold calling door to door like a vacuum salesman.
This is not and was never their intended purpose, as I've made clear just about every time I've talked about the brochures. In fact, I pretty specifically say that these are not intended to be handed out on street corners or stuck under windshield wipers. I guess I should have also mentioned not using these to cold call door to door.
The purpose of these brochures is to assist those who are talking to the bit-curious. That is, people who are already aware of bitcoin, and seek out a knowledgeable individual, to learn more. And even then these brochures are only meant to be employed when that conversation inevitably reaches the point where the bit-curious individual is asking for suggestions on specific basic bitcoin businesses/organizations/solutions. Such as "Ok, I think I get it now. So where do I get a wallet? Where do I buy and sell bitcoin?".
So yea. If you take these brochures and just walk up to random people and say something like "Can I have a few minutes to tell you about bitcoin?" its probably a waste of your time, their time, and the time, resources, and effort I and so many others put into those brochures.

Explain to me how that is possible, when in a completely privatized society there would be the removal of an entity which claims a monopoly on violence? Corporations, a fiction created by government, would no longer exist. Meaning businesses can no longer privatize their profits, and socialize their losses. So now we've eliminated a highly violent organization **AND** a large chunk of capitalist rent-seeking, and you think *that* will be **worse** than what we have today?!?

You're too kind. I'm no hero. I'm just sick and tired of being a victim. So I take full responsibility for my freedom and security. I don't view getting arrested as a choice I am not making. In fact I've allowed myself to be arrested more than once because that is what I chose to do. Its invigorating, truly. Its the liberty activist spiritual retreat, where you go to recharge your righteous indignation batteries.
Government is the man behind the curtain. All scary from the front, but just smoke and mirrors. Once the fear of arrest is gone from you its absolutely liberating. The trick is to get arrested for shit that any sane human would find ridiculous. Like feeding parking meters while wearing a pink fairy costume (this is on my to-do list).

Had OP gone along with it it would not have been entrapment because there is little to no argument OP could then make that what he did isn't something he'd have normally done had he not been coerced into doing so.
Entrapment is when police get you to do something you would not normally do. If a cop comes up to you and says "Hey, can I buy a joint?" and you say "Yes", then you're an idiot and that's not entrapment, because the cop did nothing to get you to act in a way you normally would not act.

I, Penn, and others are not arguing about the percent of the budget that goes to charity. Rather we are arguing about the moral and philosophical points of doing so. You stated you couldn't disagree more with Penn's statement, yet his statement had nothing to do with how much people are taxed, or how much of it goes to charity. He is only addressing whether or not forcing other people to do what you think is charitable actually counts as charity.

They were class mates back in third grade. 'Dorian' Satoshi stole 'Bitcoin' Satoshi's girl friend. Bitcoin Satoshi never forgot his lost love and the scoundrel who stole her away from him. When coming up with the bitcoin protocol, 'Bitcoin' Satoshi needed some pseudonym. He saw this as an opportunity to get his revenge.

Government's most basic feature is the monopoly on initiatory aggression, aka violence. This is, in fact, its defining feature. Remove its claim upon the monopoly on violence, and it is nothing more than a corporation left wondering what valuable product or service it can provide in order to continue to exist.
So, why do you think there will always be a need for a select few claiming the legitimi*ized* right to initiate aggression against the rest of the population?

Sigh, I'm going to ignore your insults and point out that both the Prosecution and Defense have time to find and speak with their potential witnesses. During the Discovery process they must then turn over all that information to their opposition. So yes, in this case both sides have been given time to find and consult with witnesses that could potentially benefit their case, but No, both sides have not given unfettered access to the information on such held by their opposite. The flow of information, which is supposed to be symmetrical, is in this case asymmetrical.

Well you're simply making a choice not to accept that definition, but providing no logical argument as to why that is not an acceptable definition. This isn't something I've made up, myself. [Even President Obama]( has admitted that the only difference between government and NGOs (in this context, private military contractors) is the monopoly on violence.
Now, to move this conversation further. You expressed a desire to see protection of property rights. Do you think this is only possible when a minority of the population claims the monopoly right to initiate violence? If so, why do private actors currently hire other private actors to protect their property, and not depend upon The State 100%?

You may be absolutely right. This is our first run, and we know that there is plenty of room for improvement.
Honestly, if the bitcoin price had stayed at $800, the price it was when we did our budget, I probably wouldn't have even been tempted to use that space for solicitation of donations. But roughly halving in value has really diminished our ability to execute. Any donations we might receive could really make a difference. I'm currently relying on meetup group organizers to place large requests on behalf of their members, so I can save a few bucks on shipping. I'd much rather just send 100 to everyone who wants some, achieving a more decentralized distribution.

BIPS.me used to offer a service somewhat like this. You'd invoice the customer through BIPS, and if they didn't already have bitcoin they could purchase through BIPS and that'd be what you get. BIPS was purchased by Coinify, and I haven't yet checked out their service so idk what's changed.

This. A few years ago I gave a joint to an undercover cop, because I thought he was an undercover cop and wanted to know. They charged me with felony distribution because I **gave** 0.46 grams of weed to another human adult. The charge, compounded by it being a second offense and occurring in a school zone, carried a sentence of 8 - 16 years in prison. I refused all plea deals offered for **months**. Finally the Asst DA, after adding a simple possession charge, straight up dropped the felony distribution charge and then re-approached about a plea deal.
I went from facing up to 16 years in prison to only serving 8 days in a county jail. And the warden kicked me out two days early.
Edit: btw I'm pretty sure they kicked me out early because I was helping other inmates write legal requests.

Corporations are able to exist only because government exists to limit their liability. Absent government its conceivable limited liability corporations would still exist, but that liability would be borne by the investors and not the general public, as happens today.
Unable to leverage government to raise the barrier to entry into their industry, the remaining market actors (corporations) will be compelled to compete, providing consumers greater choice for lower cost.

Why hasn't a company arisen to compete with BFL, copying the model you just outlined, save for one very important point: all coins mined during the "testing" phase are paid out to the bitcoin account of the purchaser. I bet people would get behind that model.
You could say "each unit tested for 24 hours" and when purchasers start seeing that bitcoin flow into their wallet they'll get all excited because it means their unit will be shipped very soon. They'll take to the interwebz proclaiming how wonderful it is to do business with your company. Boom, more pre-sales.

Nope. Its got to catch on with the customers, first. I know plenty of people in porn who know about/want bitcoin, and they're stymied on two fronts: 1. Customers not having bitcoin, and not caring about it. Certainly not wanting to be preached to while trying to rub one out, so the performer who harps on bitcoin is at a competitive disadvantage. and 2. Most performers have employers. Employers who will fire you if you try to cut them out of the loop. And most performers can not dream of reaching as large an audience on their own, as the employer can provide.

How do you figure? It mandated that everyone take part in the private insurance scheme, at the same time mandating levels of coverage that had nothing to do with the individual consumer (maternity leave for men). This guarantee of customers, plus increase in mandatory service, caused an increase in cost and a decrease in the quality of service received. And that's not even mentioning all the people who were told they could keep their coverage yet had it canceled on them anyway.
I'm absolutely mystified as to how anyone could think this is an improvement.

I am not a "climate change denier". I do not deny that climate changes.
What I *question* is the prevailing wisdom that human produced CO2 is causing/is going to cause a catastrophic warming trend, all of which necessitates surrendering more liberty in the name of security.
I object to your categorization of those who do not believe as you do as "climate deniers". Your follow up that such climate deniers must be "nuts or evil" makes it abundantly clear that there is no understanding to be had between us. You say I'm evil. I say check the mirror.

Huh? Where did I strawman you?
And why would you compare SR, which was only accessible via Tor, with Open Bazaar, which will be an application that runs on your computer? One is purposefully hidden away in the Darknet, the other is being made freely available to everyone.
And even if the legal goods on SR were only 1% of the listings, that's still impressive considering it was created to facilitate the sale of contraband. In fact it proves that a demand exists for a program/way to conduct legit commerce on something other than eBay or Craigslist. Both have gone to crap.

Well without trying to shift blame I didn't review every submission that was approved, personally. I do recall contacting DailyDealy.ca about participating, and thought they would be a good addition without doing more than a minute or two of digging. So yeah, I guess I failed to pick up on any dodgyness from the getgo, they never really registered on my radar. I was really more preoccupied with, first, finding btc-accepting merchants with a halfway passable ecommerce site, and later, targeting the frauds, scams, etc that had submitted 'uninvited'. There was a some crap that no one ever had to see, and then a couple nuggets that slipped through, plus DailyDealy. All in all if yours is the worst BBF experience I'd say we did a decent enough job. That isn't to minimize your experience, I'm sorry things didn't work out for you. Have they still been unresponsive? Has Coinbase provided any update? If they do turn out to scam you I think Coinbase might want to know.

Additionally, I don't think adoption works that way. People routinely ignore the types of handouts you're talking about. At best they'll see "bitcoin" and it will be one more exposure to them on their path to being interested in learning more. Its an expensive route to take. Plenty of other media outlets are doing that work for us, constantly exposing people to the bitcoin meme. When people finally want to learn more they turn to a knowledgeable source, whether that be a human or the internet. Absolutely no form of advertising is as effective as a sales force. That is what we as activists are, the bitcoin sales force. And no amount of direct mail, handouts, etc can replace a sales force.

You should go (re?) read NC's money transmitter laws. It does not simply apply to "money". Its concerned with "payment instruments" and means of value transfer. If you honestly read those regulations prior to this latest act you'd already know that bitcoin falls under those regulations, since it is indeed a payment instrument and means of value transfer.

I disagree. I've used my local bitcoin accepting bar to run multiple speed tests. I can pay with bitcoin, already having the bar's address stored in my app, faster than people can pay with cash (receiving change/tipping), or credit card. With the credit card I'm done paying and the owner has received an alert on his phone, while the printer is still printing out the credit card slips.
And its only going to get faster.

No, you're not wrong. I can't think of a single government that takes an anti-inflation stance. They all reserve the right to inflate the money supply for a variety of reasons.


You are correct. Value is derived from demand and scarcity.


Yes and no. Its relative. Compared to consumer items which have their prices depressed through other mechanisms (like subsidies), it appears the value of fiat is rising, or at least staying at its current level. But compare the value of the fiat compared to a commodity that is not easily manipulated, and not so much. Silver and gold are widely regarded as heavily manipulated by TPTB, and it still shows the devaluation of fiat in its price. An ounce of gold will still buy you what it would buy you 2,000 years ago (fine set of clothes, shoes, belt), yet the fiat price of these goods have risen considerably.

Coinbase was left out due to space issues. It was a gamble, as we know some people will question why they're not included, raising the same points you raised. Basically they would have fit into three different categories on the brochure: wallet, buy/sell, and merchant services. We couldn't justify giving them that much space at the expense of other businesses/organizations (13/17 of which financially support this effort). The option then was to give coinbase space off to the left, or leave them off entirely. I made the call to leave them off, saving space for the bullet list of features/benefits.
As to the why/what/when/how/etc, I'm of the opinion that a 8.5" x 11" piece of paper, no matter how pretty, can not even begin to replace a knowledgeable, motivated, enthusiastic bitcoin supporter. It really does take 10 - 30 minutes of Q &amp; A to address the concerns/questions someone new to bitcoin will bring up. The brochure's intent is derived from my own outreach efforts. I have no problem answering the vast majority of questions a newcomer will have, but when it comes time to suggest wallets/exchanges/etc I was forced to scribble urls on a napkin. This brochure replaces the napkin scribbling. Its a tool, it can only help a bitcoin supporter, not replace them.

Yes, in your example it isn't all the surprising for The State/Prosecution to devote assets to the **protection** of a witness.
But no, they don't customarily withhold the names of those witnesses from the Defense. Customarily the name **and** the subject of their testimony is shared with the Defense, so the Defense has time to prepare. This is all part of the Discovery process, which is an integral part of American Due Process.

While most might commend a hands-off approach, leaving 'Cryptos' under existing law is hardly conducive to stimulating "the growth of Bitcoin as an industry." Why? Well let's take a look at the requirements/regulations.
Consider that three states have **no** state money transmitter laws/requirements, and thus make a more attractive location to startup a bitcoin/crypto business (that involves selling/transmission). There are additional states which while they do regulate money transmitter businesses, the cost of compliance is much less burdensome.
Without doing a detailed analysis of all 47 states with money transmitter laws/regulations, I'd be willing to guess that your "hands off" approach actually leaves N.H. somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to regulatory compliance cost. And considering NH's relatively low population, NH's regulatory compliance cost per potential customer is pretty damn high.

I'd like to go ahead and officially call **BULLSHIT** on this line of reasoning.
Just how *vast* are we talking? If we're honest and look at the actual data, I think we'll find that its laughably hard to actually move **vast** amounts of value with bitcoin.
So what? A million bucks? Some people would call that vast, but honestly I wouldn't. A million bucks ten times a day, every day. Ok, now we're talking about a vast amount of money. But hey, just one million dollar transfer. Ok. I think *that* is doable with bitcoin. Anyone with a million in USD can likely jump through the hoops to get their hands on ~$1MM in BTC in 7 to 10 days. Not exactly super helpful for anyone who needs to move a million bucks from Iran to Cuba, tomorrow, but whatever.
How about a hundred million bucks? Now that's a sum I'd call vast, even though we're really just getting started. A hundred million bucks. Just how "easy" do you think it would be to convert a hundred million in cash into bitcoin? HA! Good luck getting that money onto an exchange and buying up enough coin before you die of old age. I can only make an educated guess, but I think at this size your only real option is BitPay/Coinbase off-exchange transactions, and you **KNOW** they're going to perform colonoscopies in order to KYC, or anonymous operators of Russian bitcoin exchange BTCe, and they're, uh, anonymous.
Ok, what about ten billion dollars? Well that's simply [this](
Really, at the current market cap, bitcoin is **shit** if you're a criminal overlord who needs to move vast sums of money around. And if you're one of the **REAL** master criminals, you're already using HSBC/Democracy to get what you want, anyway.

"your". What games? I am not part of some organization or group, other than I hadn't formed an opinion on what should or should not be done about the blocksize, when I noticed the 'fight' that was occurring, mainly in the form of heavy handed/biased moderation in I really think we need to stop looking at each other as part of, or representative of, some group, but instead as individuals.

Well when we're talking about being paid in bitcoin you can think of it as dollar-cost-averaging. If I wait to get paid until the end of the two week pay period, my entire pay is held liable to that moments price and volatility. Whereas if I get a penny in bitcoin every minute it will help to average out the ups and downs. Additionally, since the technology allows real-time payments now, what point is there in giving my employer a 1-2 week payday loan every pay period? I could use my money.

@_date: 2016-03-15 04:42:57


I'd like to propose a third group, of which I would readily self-identify: Those opposed to the suppression of free expression and exchange of information, especially for what can be perceived as possibly nefarious purposes.


Assuming your timeline of events are true, I still do not support the response that was given. I'd much prefer that oversimplifying and misleading blog posts were met with reasoned, logical arguments, that furthered the intelligence of the average subscriber. Not the pointless flamewar that erupted (imo) in response to censorship.

The only way you gain trusted feedback with localbitcoins is if you do basically any of the options *other* than cash-in-person, which imo is the only reason to use localbitcoins. So anyone who specializes in selling bitcoin for cash, face to face, is likely to have zero feedback, despite the fact that they are reliable.

Because a roadmap seems to be the result of a consensus, which may or may not include a compromise or three.
Its hard to claim that what a group says they will do is undeniably want they **want** to do.

Venmo is a better solution to moving value right now than Bitcoin........

Jesus Christ, people were giving away fifty BTC blocks like they were candy, because they were currently worth *less* than candy. They were running their computers at a complete loss, just because they were techonologically or ideologically motivated to support this new innovation.
People created websites and faucets where you could get yourself a little drop, which in retrospect wasn't all that little.
Bitcoin "whales" were tipping 1, 5, 10, 20 btc at a time in threads about their crazy gambling run.
Everyone and their mothers took a small personal loss to try to bootstrap Bitcoin. And now we're to believe that because one such entity did so with BCH, bypassing the years it took Bitcoin, that's to somehow be looked down upon...
Edit: Fork.lol has the opportunity cost calculated! Check this out! 
So far miners have lost about a billion dollars mining BCH instead of BTC. But that's rapidly changing.

So  gets a notification from a user asking a very simple and straightforward question of TWO different mining pools. Wanting to best represent his/her pool, as he/she is paid to do, the  social media OP answers forthright and honestly.
Idiots claim this is proof two are one.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:49:10
The first couple waves, it can be argued, we're committed to the original vision of Bitcoin in the White Paper.
A hostile takeover could not have occurred three or four years ago. It was only possible when later waves of adopters, who couldn't give two shits about cypherpunk theory, became the majority.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:17:00
And it should be noted that the current mempool is around 25MB, which is 25 times the current blocksize, and will still be at least 12.5 times the segwit block size.

I'd like to agree with you but near as I can tell 'archos' is singular.

What would be the point considering Bitcoin is destined to be a behind-the-scenes settlement later only known to a tiny few who work in 'IT', and is NEVER to be used for something so mundane as a five dollar purchase.
So again, what's the point.

Frankly I don't care anymore what this tiny subreddit calls "alt coins". Bitcoin is no longer the undisputed leader of crypto-currency, and it is unlikely to regain that spot with the current developers and community.
I'm sure there are still people who think AOL is the best social network, simply because it came first. They mockingly deride MySpace enthusiasts...
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:14:50
By the "logic" displayed in this thread ALL bitcoin developers are geocentrists...

here is my claim:
**God does not exist**

@_date: 2017-08-22 14:56:43
I figured I would get asked this.
What would demand currently be if the blocksize was 2MB? 4MB? 32MB?
Surely it would be greater than 1MB. Arguably (and it would not be hard to argue) it would be higher than today, as people like myself would not be using other, faster/cheaper/better means of transferring value.
On my morning drive I realized I've been subconsciously making these choices for a while now. I learned about HumbleBundle because of Bitcoin. Even bought my first few games from them with Bitcoin. But I can't remember the last time I did so, and I currently pay for my monthly recurring subscription with my debit card. Its simply cheaper, faster, and easier than using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:01:48
AntPool was also tagged in the question...
Like most incontrovertible "proof" posted to this sub this is some grasping bs.

Fuck is the point when you're being disingenuous from the outset? I'm not claiming to speak for anyone but myself. Whereas you claim to speak for everyone else and have pre-emptively ruled my words to be lacking in value.
So what is the point?
And I'm an AnCap, not a hipster. Part of that first wave of early adopters. The reason is still in the sidebar for this sub. In summation, please choke on a dick.

Look if you'd been around this sub for more than the two months your account has existed you'd be well aware of the fact that new accounts aren't trusted because they tend to engage in irrational shilling.
If you had an older account you should have stuck with it. Been willing to put your name in front of your mouth.
Instead you chose to hide behind a non-identifying pseudonym. Its your fault no one will trust what you have to say, because it appears to us you haven't put in the time.

@_date: 2017-08-07 21:33:52
Look asshole, you don't get to define what is Pro-bitcoin and Anti-bitcoin.
Bitcoin to me is the ideals behind the attempt. Not the attempt. Anyone who's been in Bitcoin for longer than a couple years knows that this first attempt is most likely to fail. But the ideal of a decentralized, peer to peer, cryptographic currency resistant to attempt to co-opt is alive and well, despite Bitcoin's failure to live up to said ideals.

That's silly. The meteoric rise of the alts is the direct result of people seeking alternative means to move value. The Darknet Markets have been instituting alts for over a year, at the **behest** of their users who are sick and tired of long waits and expensive fees.

@_date: 2017-08-21 19:41:02
Again, only if you define a "true bitcoiner" as one who satisfies the conditions you and the previous asshole set.
Now let's say, for argument, I know how to run a node and have run at least one, on and off, since 2012.
What new condition will be set to disqualify me? Must I also be a miner? Must I also be a coder?
Must I be Satoshi before you assholes will stop questioning my credentials to speak on MOTHER FUCKING REDDIT?

The (US) courts have repeatedly ruled that being equally effected by some thing does not qualify you for standing. Like when a politician or government agency does some unconstitutional act like spy on your private papers and person, *even if you can prove they spied on you*, it still doesn't make you special enough in the eyes of the court to garner standing.

People had trouble withdrawing fiat/cash/etc from Mt Gox, so they started using their GoxBucks to buy GoxBTC which was still pretty much BTC because there wasn't much difficulty withdrawing bitcoin until the last six or so weeks, iirc.

Tough one. If we use the average of all candidates, then even if shit goes tits up and FoxNews panders to their 1/2/3 favorites and shits all over Rand Paul, they also equally shit all over another 6+ candidates, right? The question then becomes whether or not Rand Paul gets within 10% of a field which is mostly shat on. The average of three big speakerss and seven nobodies could be low enough that even though the statement "the same as everyone else" is false, you still win the bet.
Shall we simply bet on whether or not there is a deviation of greater than X %? 
"the same as everyone else" would be something like: 7:34, 8:19, 8:22, 7:53, 7:42, 8:37, 8:10, 8:02, 7:59, 8:26
Whereas I'm willing to bet it will be more like: 12:46, 11:11, 10:23, 7:45, 3:55, 3:20, 2:45, 2:22, 2:01, 1:43

@_date: 2015-08-08 14:59:53
Good news, you don't really need to understand how bitcoin works to benefit from using it.
Here's all you need to know to get that subscription.
First you need a way to collect and hold the bitcoin you need to purchase. This is accomplished by getting a "wallet". A wallet is an app which holds all the various bitcoin addresses you'll need. You can get an app for just about any device you own. There are even wallets which aren't apps, nor connected to the internet, but we won't bother with that for now, we're just trying to get you your NFL2Go subscription. Plenty of time to learn more later.
Got an Android? Go to the Play Store and download "Mycelium". Its a wallet app that I use myself and highly recommend. Have an iPhone? Go to the app store and get "Breadwallet". Its highly recommended.
Ok, now you're able to receive, store, and send bitcoin, you just need some coins!
Goto localbitcoins.com. For your first time buying you'll probably benefit greatly from a p2p cash transaction. The seller will likely to be willing to sit down and answer some questions, and generally guide you through the process. Its easy once you know what you're doing. So yeah, go to Localbitcoins.com, input your zipcode or whatever, and check out the "Buy bitcoins with cash near _your town_" options. Got people nearby you willing to trade their bitcoin for your cash? Great! Make it happen. You should be able to figure this part out for yourself. Ignore the Localbitcoins.com wallet, you'll just be using the wallet app you installed earlier. Doing so will make for a much faster transaction, with less hoops to jump through.
No one local? Ok, then we've got to go the slightly more difficult route. This is going to require you to use the wallet LocalBitcoins.com supplies. Check out all the "Cash Deposit" options. With this method you need only find a seller who has an account at a bank convenient to you. The other variables you'll want to take into account is the premium the seller charges (you'd rather pay a 5% premium than a 10% premium, obviously) and any wait period they might stipulate for new buyers (usually end of business day). Alright, now that you've found a listing you like go ahead and initiate the sale by telling the seller how much you want to buy. He/she will respond with a friendly "hey, thanks for initiating a trade with me! These are my bank details, and here are the instructions you'll need". Basically you take your cash to a local branch of their bank, fill out a deposit slip with the necessary details, walk up to the teller with cash and deposit slip and say "I'd like to make a deposit". They generally do not ask you why you're trying to deposit money in their bank, lol. Upon successful deposit take the receipt they've given you and head back home. The seller will likely ask you to write on the receipt in such a fashion that you won't be able to take the receipt back to the bank and get your cash back, thereby scamming the vendor. He/she will most likely want photographic evidence you've done this, and some ask you then tear the receipt in half. Upload the pics, mark the trade complete on your end, and wait for the seller to release the bitcoin into your LocalBitcoins.com wallet.
Ok, now you've got coin in your LBC wallet. From here you can transfer to your mobile wallet, or straight to the merchant. Its safest to get your coin off of hosted wallets like LBC. Additionally many vendors use a processor who will give you something like 10 mins to complete the transaction. If you send from a hosted wallet there is a good chance it won't get there in 10 mins or less. So transfer from your LBC hosted wallet to your mobile wallet you setup earlier.
Anyway, sending bitcoin is a lot like sending an email. You simply need to know the destination address. In bitcoin this is a string of letters and numbers, not a Name identifier. Double and triple check that you've correctly input the address, taking into account Capitalization. So you go to NFL2Go, do all the checkout stuff, get to the point where they ask you for payment and use your mobile wallet to scan the QR code they display. The Quick Read code is a visual representation of their bitcoin address, and that info will automatically be input into your app. Maybe even the amount they request, as well. Input the amount owed if they don't do so for you, then hit send. Bitcoin is now doing its magic, and the payment should be received and created in seconds.
Wow that got long. Don't be discouraged, it really is much easier than all this text would seem to imply.

No, if my statement is taken to imply anything, it is that you and ChangeTip are *incentivized* to prefer smaller blocks.
People lacking interests in off-chain solutions also lack this incentive which exists for you and other off-chain providers.
Does that incentive exceed the incentive to see bitcoin go **big**? I don't think so, but that isn't my call. I could see a company like Coinbase being in favor of bigger blocks, because they stand to gain more through greater adoption, as opposed to greater control/share of the (smaller) market.

The difference here is the company "Trees" is gaining terrific PR for its currently existing business. Who/what is Hendo?
"Trees" is just borrowing a page from Jeff Bezos and saying they're trying to get approval for such a service. Was the Amazon drone story a hoax? No, just ~~vaporware~~ PR.
Edit: Back when Sony had introduced Playstation 2, but still wanted to move old Playstation units, they ran a TV ad for the Playstation 9. It was a brain implant with all types of cool shit. But the true message was at the end "go back to where it all started: Playstation". Was Sony perpetrating a hoax by advertising the Playstation 9? No, they were just reaching their target market with an imaginative piece of marketing, in order to drive sales of currently existing products/services.

Cool, let me know what you come up with. I don't know Reason's metric, either. And someone quoted something from saying quite different numbers (Trump higher, Rand lower).
I'd also like to know how many questions were asked of each candidate. I suppose its possible people were behind the scenes measuring unscripted speaking time and increasing/decreasing questions asked accordingly (in order to give each candidate nearly equal speaking time like they claimed they would do), but I think its highly unlikely. Either way it should be easy to check. If Trump got the most questions, as well as the most speaking time, then they obviously weren't curtailing questioning to spread out the time.

No, I don't. If society progressed past the point of valuing the conductive property of metals, their utility would decrease. If the value was intrinsic all along, there would be no decrease in what is a *subjective* valuation.
If there were no humans to covet and value metals they would have no intrinsic value. They would still maintain their utility, but there would be no one to utilize it.

It does. Whenever you go from a monopoly industry to free competition the potential for corruption decreases dramatically. If COMPANY A is the only game in town, they can do whatever they want. But when Companies A, B, C, and D are all competing for your business, basic game theory dictates that one or more will "defect" in order to gain a competitive advantage.

Ok, let's try a little thought experiment.
The government is gone. In its place is a Voluntary Society in which every product and service is provided voluntarily, or not at all.
A man murders someone. Let's say the victim was trespassing on the murderers property.
Has aggression been initiated? Well Man A used violence against Man B, right? So yes, aggression has been initiated.
Now let's say the Voluntary mechanism for finding Justice determines that the murderer was in fact a murderer. The victim wasn't trespassing, he was just walking by minding his own business. The "Court" finds that the murderer must pay one tenth of his productive value, yearly, to the family of the victim, for the rest of his natural life. He refuses. So the victim's family's Dispute Resolution Organization moves that the murderer be confined to his property, and forced to labor on the behalf of the victim's family. Productive value will be seized from him yearly and given to the aggrieved.
Has aggression again been initiated? No, this aggression is only a response to the original aggression.
Or, let's say there is a violent psychopath loose. He has murdered someone. Gotten caught, etc. But this time the "Court" determines that no rehabilitation is possible, this man is simply a monster who poses a grave danger to society. The sentence is death.
Did the "Court" initiate aggression, or did the psychopath? Again, it was the psychopath, not the "Court".

They've all done wrong, but I'm especially interested in Danny Brewster.
Last I heard he had left/fled Cyprus, but claimed he had left his family behind and intended to return. He claimed the accusations against him were bogus, that he was in touch with the local police, and that he had, or would, pay back those he owed personally.
Did he ever return to Cyprus? What happened to his family? Where is he now?

If I knew this I would instruct my Dispute Resolution Organization to **not** list you among those I'd find acceptable in arbitrating my dispute. If I did not know this, and then got burned, everyone else would then know, and your corrupt arbiter would be blacklisted. This is why you'd probably never corrupt that arbiter to begin with. There is far more for that person to gain by playing it straight, than by attempting to be corrupt.


Sure we can! The **VAST** majority of humanity already adheres to the Natural Law. Its something we've all been taught first as children, and then as adults. Do not hit. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Do not rape. Do not murder. Basically: do not use force or fraud to deprive someone of their life, liberty, or property. And again, 99.99% of humanity already does this quite naturally. Transitioning to a Voluntary Society in which people understand that it is criminal (not illegal, criminal) to use force or fraud to deprive another of their life, liberty, or property, will not be difficult for the vast majority of people alive today. Who will it be hard on? Well those who already do not adhere to the Natural Law. Its going to be extra hard for those former oppressors who believe they have/had a divine right to use might in order to rule.

Hearing the cases of people who **voluntarily** come to it for redress of grievance?
A voluntary organization forces nothing on society. It just provides a service that may or may not be desired. It gains its legitimacy because everything it engages in it does so *voluntarily*.
Which is more legitimate? The holy man at the top of the mountain whom demands you respect him, and tithe him? Or is the the holy man at the top of the mountain who demands nothing, but rather freely provides when asked?
Which is more legitimate? The auto service center which uses thugs to burn down all of their competitors, forcing the local populace to use their service? Or is it the auto center just outside of town which does nothing but compete on the merits of their product and service?
To me, the more legitimate entity will always be the one that exists by voluntarily providing a valuable product or service, not the entity which claims a violent monopoly over me and all those inside "its" borders.

The more I look at it (and I mean it, actually go to the site and experience all this for yourself), the more I think this is genius.
Rather than deal with dozens of people, all wanting to see their product/service get more exposure, there is a cheap bounty system. Send $0.25 in bitcoin to the corresponding address, and your preferred product/service will receive better placement. Additionally, payment for advertisement is not limited to the product/service purveyors, with this system regular folk can send a tip to get their preferred product/service more exposure on Bitcoin.com, arguably the best bitcoin domain in existence.
Edit: Additionally it took two clicks before I was prompted to give anything, and the page they were on made it abundantly clear what this is all about.

LocalBitcoins.com staff/owners. In order for the seller to offer the bitcoin to the buyer he/she must place them in an escrow account controlled by LBC. If the buyer does everything correctly but the seller refuses to release then the buyer appeals to the site, who then release the coin to the buyer, and take some sort of action against the seller. IDK what because I don't know of this ever actually happening. Sellers maintain their income by maintaining their reputation. There is feedback and all that jazz. I've never seen an LBC scam accusation.
Edit: I **HAVE** seen LBC scam accusations. But the accused is always the buyer, not the seller. And its been a while since I've seen one of these, as LBC sellers learned that lesson and instituted policies which prevent this.

The website he owns?


Because he wants to? I always suggest Mycelium for Android, but I'm not getting paid to do so. Nor does my endorsement constitute a scam.


What others? What obligation do you imagine he has to you and to bitcoin at large? Does he owe it to every bitcoin wallet creator to advertise their creation on his website? Why is his private property any of your business? Just because he was a *very* early adopter, and was able to see the future value in "bitcoin.com"? Do you make a similar claim to all the bitcoin he got way early?


By who? I'm quite sure Roger has more btc than any wallet developer. He is one of those ideologically motivated early adopters who profits by increased adoption. Shit, is there even a wallet out there with a revenue stream? How the hell do you imagine he'll get more wealthy from pushing adoption of one wallet, rather than bitcoin as a whole?

What is the barrier of entry to the private arbitration business? What's the overhead? Virtually nil.
So any Joe Schmoe can throw his hat in the ring and say "fuck those corrupt arbiters, pick me".
And see, in a free market arbitration system the two (or more) concerned parties are not going to settle on just one arbiter over another. No, they'll designate representatives (Dispute Resolution Organizations) who each put up a list of acceptable, impartial, third party arbitration. The one which gets the job is the one which is acceptable by all concerned parties.

What article? The OP?
I believe the counter on the site, which is updated every time a participant emails moved and says "I'm so and so, I made the move!". There is an actual human volunteer reading those emails and estimating their validity.
Sure some have tripped the counter and then moved out of the state (I'm one of them), but many more have made the move and never informed the FSP, or moved without ever having signed the Statement Of Intent (pledge). All in all I'd say its a rather accurate estimation of the number of people who've actually moved to NH to participate in the intent behind the Free State Project, that being the creation of a society in which the *maximum* role of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property.

1. It was completely voluntary. Its the Honor system. Nothing it to be gained for Liberty by expending time and effort on identifying and shaming these people. Quite the opposite.
2. Some signed a LONG time ago. Way back when the Pledge actually had a two year deadline to reach 20,000 signers. It failed to reach that goal, and the pledge had to be amended to remove that deadline. Many who had already signed viewed this as a violation of the agreement. Here we are over a decade later, so I can't say I disagree with them or wish to hold them to their 'word'.
3. Again, its been a long time and a LOT has happened. Who are you and who am I to assign shame or blame to someone who signed in 2006, then started a family, bought a house, got underwater on their mortgage, lost their job, got a part-time job well beneath them in order to pay for an apartment so his/her young family would not be homeless, just finally clawed their way back to their 2006 income, etc?
4. Finally, there is nothing stopping people from moving to New Hampshire, over the next several decades, to join the fight for liberty. I suspect the Free State Project Inc will evolve to encourage liberty activists to continue to relocate to New Hampshire. Would you rather they spent their limited resources on going after those who've moved on?

I've provided a shred. IBM and others are experimenting with blockchain tech, but not Bitcoin's blockchain. That evidence supports your theory just as much as it does mine. Short of going to the decision makers and questioning them point blank regarding their intent *not* to use Bitcoin's blockchain, I don't think I'm going to be able to provide you what you're asking for. Nor am I going to spend the rest of the day combing the internet for circumstantial evidence supporting my theory.
The truth is big actors **aren't** investing their infrastructure into Bitcoin's blockchain. They're using alternative means. Why? I say its because current Bitcoin tech can't meet their needs. You say its because Bitcoin has a tarnished reputation. Whatever, the bottomline is Bitcoin isn't attracting the type of large actors **you** claim Bitcoin will act as a settlement mechanism for... And yet blocks are still filling up fast, and regular old bitcoin users are being inconvenienced. And for what? Again, its not to serve as the settlement layer for large actors.
Its becoming the crypto-currency of the masochist.

Fair enough. I'll not waste my time arguing this point, further.


Would it really though? Would there not be some equilibrium point met between those who want to get their transaction into Bitcoin's blockchain, and those who give up and seek out and attempt to employ one of the *many* alternatives? And I'd imagine as more and more decide to try these new, slowly improving (utility-wise) alternatives, that equilibrium point for Bitcoin's blockchain fee would begin to drop. Basically I imagine an equilibrium being sought in the rate at which Bitcoin's blockchain fee decreases in response to decreased demand in the face of strengthening competition.
Why would Big Actor A continue to pay a ridiculously high fee to be one of the lucky few to employ Bitcoin's blockchain, when he/she could save considerably by switching to a competitor?

You're going to have to contend with some rather large disadvantages. It was hard enough convincing people to move to NH with the winter weather it has, but MT is obviously worse.
And there is less to do. And less people to do it with. And the few people who do live there are spread far apart. And its landlocked. And its neighbors are similarly devoid of people and opportunity. And any success in Montana is unlikely to be adopted and replicated by a large population state. In fact its far more likely to be ignored and dismissed as only possible in a big state with a tiny population and little in the way of economic opportunity.
And seriously, even though the FSP isn't recruiting anymore, you're still going to have to compete with the liberty community in New Hampshire. Why move to start a new liberty community in the middle of nowhere Montana, when you can join a migration of 20,000 hardcore liberty activists headed to New Hampshire. If anything its going to be an even tougher sell now that the FSP has hit its ambitious goal.

That's it. It took the FSP, more specifically dozens, if not hundreds, of individuals, over a decade to recruit 20,000 participants, whom will comprise ~1.5% of the general population. Ask yourself if adding 1.5% to Montana's population is going to be what it takes to tip the scales. Then ask yourself if you can realistically recruit all those people, on your own. And again, look at your competition. FSP is the New York Yankees of liberty migration efforts. And it already exists in a relatively inhospitable climate. Montana is not all that different from Wyoming, and the couple hundred FSWyoming folks have had little to no success doing what you propose to do.

Let me just cut to the chase. "Rights" are fictional constructs. There are no such things are "rights". There are only abilities. I support life because it is the moral and ethical position. All life. I oppose war just as much as I oppose abortion. I support every individuals self-determination.

I disagree. The community did not decide, it acquiesced. Regardless, another person's support for a criminal organization does not make it legitimate, in my eyes. The KKK had popular support, yet they were no more legitimate than if they had little support. 


Which is more courageous? To seek my fortune in some mythical friendly land, or to seek my fortune where I live, in spite of the criminal elements? You say its more courageous to run away? Get real. Should all of the abolitionists just moved to a country where slavery was illegal, rather than seek to improve their homeland?




How shall I prove my conviction to you?

But in this case we're only talking about users saying "don't allow my transaction to be placed in a block **larger than** *this*". Its asking the users for their personal upper limit, not a lower limit.
So 99% of users support blocks being less than 8GB? Ok, make your blocks anything less than that.
This isn't a mechanism for users to communicate "this big, or else!"

Screw the discount as enticement. Bring back Purse Magic! I texted that number and asked "Is this for real" and 'you' responded "YES". SO BRING IT BACK! I WANT MY DAMN HAT!
Seriously, texting you my order and info and being done is a lot more enticing than an additional discount. Besides the fraud risk, I don't use Purse.io because I can't be bothered to do all that leg work myself. I can't even get past worrying about putting my wishlist and address online. Just let me text you what I want and send it to me. Please.

"No. Transactions 	953"
And that's **every** transaction that address has ever participated in, both sending and receiving. But shit, for the sake of "argument" let's assume that number is 100% "stupid" bitcoiners. 953 is 0.59% of this sub's subscribers. Therefore we can say your brush is overly broad at a 168 : 1 ratio.

Both are organizations which claim the right to wield a monopoly on violence over the population in a given region.

Give ISIL a couple/few hundred years and their statesmen and judges and police will look eerily similar to the US.

I didn't say they were the exact same.
But they're both undeniably in a special class of organization: one which claims the right to use violence to further its goals and gets away with it. 
This special class has been home to tyrants, conquerors, raiders, monarchies, theocracies, democracies, republics, tribes, dictators, despots, and more. Will you try to claim the English monarchy is nothing like the Viking conquerors of previous centuries?
ISIL is just a new group trying to join that special class. Current members are loathe to approve of new members, especially in this day and age, as the joining of that special class can be a remarkably honest affair: War of Conquest. And that's the part that can be upsetting to people who might believe their government is somehow different. The creation of a new Nation-State via War of Conquest is a disgustingly violent endeavor, the only goal being the establishment of yourself and your cohorts as ruler. People are willing to be their most violent and destructive in order to attain the position of someone who can extract wealth from the populace at will, and everyone else will eventually pretend as though such is legitimate. Especially since they have their own worldview, which includes a ruling class, to protect.

So in reality you're simply collectivizing the arguments of many individuals and then assigning that collectivized entity labels you choose.
I **self-identify** as a libertarian. I represent myself and only myself. I know that I am free no matter what rules surround me because I am morally responsible for everything **I** do. Ask me what I believe. But realize you are only speaking with one person who specifically refuses to speak for others.

Its their float. Or rather its the amount of bitcoin that due to their transactional volume is regularly on-site. A large vendor can easily do 200 - 300 btc in business a DAY. These vendors withdraw funds as often as possible within reason, so its not like they were being cavalier about their wealth.
In addition to that withdrawals were stopped roughly a week before the site went down. So vendors had a week to pile up bitcoin in their accounts with no way to remove it. The smart ones went on vacation and stopped selling once they realized they couldn't withdraw their funds. Others just kept on selling expecting Evo to fix the issue.

I tried to get an explanation from support. She told me little to nothing. When I asked if it might have been fraud on the part of the buyer, she was like "maybe". No help whatsoever.

Finalizing Early would not have solved this problem. The coins stolen weren't just those sitting in escrow, but also those sitting in vendor accounts prior to withdrawals. Automatic withdrawals were canceled a week before the site disappeared, and only manual withdrawals were being sparsely granted, in order to maintain appearances.
So Finalizing Early would have only removed the coins from escrow and placed them in the vendor's Evo "wallet", which is/was controlled by the admins. Basically the admins were capable of stealing **ANY** bitcoin that was in their system.
The only way to bypass this threat is to send btc direct to an address not controlled by the site, or use multi-sig.

While much of the world is still busy playing around with physical money, there is a new currency on the web called **bit coin** that has become a popular alternative to other forms of currency. The **bit coin** payment process is easy. It is also extremely secure. Paying with **bit coin** allows for people to engage in truly private transactions on the web. Forget needing to make payments through middle men. It's not even necessary to involve one's bank to make a **bit coin** transaction happen. Aside from being a type of Internet currency, **bit coin** is not vulnerable to the usual bank practices of currency manipulation. Rather, specialized coding procedures are used to ensure the stability of **bit coin** and prevent these manipulations from occurring. Now anyone can use this decentralized currency. All that a person needs to get started is a computer or similar smart device that can access the Internet.
Why use **bit coin** instead of other conventional payment options?
* The unique coding method, called a block chain, employed in a bit coin transaction makes it next to impossible for third party entities to hack into and follow your transactions. This is a nice way to keep other people's prying eyes out of your business, even government entities.

No, I don't think all of the bitcoin they stole was amassed in just the week previous. But a large percentage was. Let's say just 25% for argument's sake. That's still $15MM in weekly volume.
To go back to where this whole "conversation" started, I'm simply asking you at what point does the loss of btc in an exit scam stop being "an idiot sum"? When you've profited 10 times what you lose? 100 times what you lose? 1000 times what you lose? That was the whole point of my foray into this conversation. And you should be able to be honest and admit that at some point on the profitability scale you'd no longer consider risking that much bitcoin to be "an idiot sum".

How do you figure I wasn't inconvenienced?
I wanted Product A. I placed an order for such with Purse. It was guaranteed to be in my mailbox two days later. A **week** later I still don't have Product A, and learn that the order has been canceled. I don't have what I ordered. I then had to go somewhere else to order what I wanted.
So I wanted a product. Expected to have it in two days. Didn't get it for ten days. How is that not inconvenienced?


I disagree. I think Purse needs to require the Buyer to provide tracking info to the Seller. Then the Seller can see if the delivery is actually in progress, instead of being clueless and having to wait a week to confirm that shit ain't coming.

Then here is how you can make it more valuable: Increase its circulation. Right now we produce and distribute a little over 40k issues every three months. Let's double that. 80k issues every three months is twice as valuable as 40k every three months.
We can accomplish this by getting more distribution deals at big events, but there are only so many events and only so much time. We can also accomplish this by recruiting more small distributors. These can be individuals who order a case (30, I think) and take upon themselves the responsibility to make sure they get into the right hands. There are quite a few individuals and groups who already do this, but there could always be more.
Which is why I asked you to let people know they can get a copy of yBitcoin delivered straight to their door by the printer, for free, just by subscribing online. Make sure a copy winds up in your Doctor's/Dentist's waiting room, every issue. Make sure that investment group meetup you're a member of sees an issue. Make sure your boss gets an issue. Stuff like that.

No, I'm not.
A government claims a monopoly on violence. The society I am describing does not tolerate **ANYONE** claiming the right to initiate aggression.
Defense, dispute resolution, and even the law are all provided by market actors in a competitive, **voluntary**, environment.
How do you get consensus around 'the law' is such a situation? You go with the lowest common denominator. That is what the vast majority of people are willing to **voluntarily** pay for. That means the defense of life, liberty, and property, and that's about it. I'm not paying my Defense Agency to harass the neighbor kid for smoking pot.
But if my neighbors are poor, I'm signing with a Defense Force that includes coverage for poor neighbors as part of the policy. Its in my own best interest to ensure that they too have access to defense, dispute resolution, and the law.

I see no mention of bitcoin on their main page. This wouldn't be an issue if they didn't list the fact they accept Mastercard, Visa, Discover, and American Express right at the bottom of their main page.
I'd prefer not to list bitcoin "accepting" vendors who don't show that they actually accept bitcoin until **AFTER** you've given them your personal/shipping info.
If a business isn't willing to list that they accept bitcoin alongside all the other payment methods they accept, well then I don't feel real confident in their status as a "bitcoin-accepting" vendor. They could stop accepting bitcoin tomorrow and none of us would know until we took the time to go all the way through their shopping process, giving them all our personal info. I've experienced this myself too many times and I won't subject fellow bitcoiners to the same.

Painfully obvious. This wasn't more than a month after the Florida LBC arrests. He hit me up first through LocalBitcoins. I went and met him and he seemed ok. If anything he was far more normal than my normal customers, far more physically fit, and chose to meet me in a parking lot rather than a cafe.
He was **real** quick to hand me his money. Lucky for me I'd just sent btc from my blockchain wallet to Mycelium so I was still waiting for a confirmation when he casually informed me he would be using the btc to purchase ketamine to give to veterans who were suffering from PTSD. I gave him his money back and noped right the fuck out of there.

Japanese law lets the police hold a suspect for questioning for like three weeks, once arrested. As such Japanese police will introduce one charge, wait three weeks, introduce another, wait three more weeks, etc, to keep the suspect in jail for longer, giving them more time to interrogate and such.

I can't speak as to water, but food...
It only takes a serious snow storm to cause shelves to empty. Any major city has about a day's supply of food on the shelves. Another day's supply in the back (at best, I'm being very generous). Another day's supply in trucks currently en route to them. And at least one more day's supply back at the distribution hub. What's that? 4 day's supply? And if the trucks can't get to you its a 2 day supply.
As to the bigger picture, California is having some **SERIOUS** water issues, and they're *kind of a big deal* when it comes to putting food on American plates. Absent any other factors, there are likely to be some food issues in the U.S. over the next decade.

5/6 days later I still have no package, and I ask support if the buyer has the tracking info (the tracking info **really** should be given to the [btc] seller by default). No response. The next day the entire order was canceled and the wish list emptied.

I *just* told you that DNMs are moving towards others currency solutions.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:37:13


I'll ignore your insult and attempt to dispel your ignorance.
It is quite possible that a large amount of every bitcoin in existence were traded on Evo over the last year. You see when someone buys something over a DNM the bitcoin goes to the vendor. The vendor then has to sell the bitcoin locally in order to get cash for more product. Meanwhile, the buyer has consumed or sold all of the product they purchased and are now flush with cash. They need to buy some bitcoin in order to buy some more product. This happens over and over and over again. So even if only 150k btc were able to be used in DNM trading, they were all easily traded back and forth numerous times for months and months. So if Evo had 150k btc from one week of operation, multiply that by 52 weeks to roughly see how much btc moved through their operation in a year. 7.8MM btc. 7.88MM unique bitcoins? No. The same bitcoin recycled over and over again.

@_date: 2015-03-13 14:33:57
Abner Doon through deft application of skill, cunning, resources, etc, rose to the very top of (the government of) the advanced civilization of the time. He purposefully worked to compromise the foundation of that civilization, one which he viewed as not only corrupt, but also detrimental to the long term survival of the species. He did everything in his power to increase the corruption. He did everything he could to not only destroy the system from within, but do so in a calculated fashion as to focus all of his efforts and the reactions/consequences of those efforts to culminate in one place at one point in time, resulting in overwhelming total revolution and destruction of the old way. He put humanity into a new Dark Age, but in doing so sowed the seeds for what was to come, which was a species and civilization that had spread to the stars and could not be snuffed out.
Edit: And yes, you should go get and read **The Worthing Saga** by Orson Scott Card

No aggression is initiated by the Dispute Resolution Companies, or any other company in a Voluntary society.
When you sign up with a D.R.O. you agree that if you are found to have violated the life, liberty, or property of another, you agree to allow restitution to be extracted from you. You further agree that all dispute resolution will be handled by an impartial third party arbiter, one who is mutually agreeable to all concerned.
That's simply a condition of the service. No D.R.O. is going to contract with someone who refuses to abide by impartial arbitration and fair restitution when found in the wrong. Their insurance company wouldn't allow them to do so.

Sorry, no. Government is not an organization which provides basic services like law, dispute resolution, and defense. Its an organization which claims the right to initiate aggression in order to provide various services, like "order".
An organization which supplies dispute resolution voluntarily, claiming no right to initiate aggression against the people it serves in order to serve them, is not a government.


But a government *first* **violates** your rights and the rights of others. It fucks for virginity. It kills for peace. It violates to protect.
The service you desire can be supplied by competing services who do not claim the right to break the rules in order to enforce them.

But there will be a bit of self-selection going on with the people who choose to watch your video, so its a bit safer for you to mention it in that context.




Yup. So long as we maintain our high quality of distribution, any increase in circulation is a big win for us and our advertisers. If the market demands we produce an issue every month, that's what we'll do. If the market demands we bring back Bitcoin Magazine, that's what we'll do.

1. Bitcoin/bitcoin is a both a unit of account and a payment method. Comparing two payment methods to bitcoin, the unit of account, rather than bitcoin the payment method, is hardly fair.
2. Yes. Because, as it says in the sidebar, Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Considering the subject, it makes all the sense in the world for bitcoin donations to be accepted. And they are, just not on the very first donation page.

Operating under that assumption: the new-to-the-scene mom and pop have a real world reputation to protect, as well as their local business, property, etc. I wouldn't worry too much about sending btc to a business that just started *also* doing business online.

Tell that to the Canary in the Coal Mine; the Darknet Markets.
Over the last few months they've been falling over themselves to allow altcoins to be used, specifically Ether and Monero, **AT THE BEHEST OF THEIR USERS AND VENDORS**.
The people who gave Bitcoin its value at the beginning, and use it every moment of every day for their commerce, are leaving it behind because it no longer serves their needs.
Edit: But oh yes, its **me** who displays a deep misunderstanding of bitcoin, not the developers who display a deep misunderstanding of game theory, economics, and marketing...

I'm really tired of this. I'm tired of having to devote even a speck of brainpower to create a screenname and password for a site I'll probably never use again. Which will result in months and months of emails from the site. Followed by years of emails from other sources after the site sells my contact info.
For what? So I can purchase something with a payment method that makes that entire practice one that provides me no value? Giving you all my info gets me nothing, but gets you something.
No thanks. I just want to trade value for value, and my personal information is not for sale.

Or is it someone who has, probably unknowingly, violated one or more of a multitude of laws, rules, regulations, guidelines, etc?

I ordered stuff, the order got picked up, and nothing ever came. A week later the order was canceled as was the wishlist. No explanation from the site other than "your btc has been returned to your wallet" (which wasn't even true when I read the message, it sat in escrow for another six hours...).
As a first time user, what I really wanted was an explanation as to why I had waited a week for something that was supposed to arrive in two days, for absolutely nothing. How does their system allow this to happen? Suffice it to say after waiting a week for nothing I wasn't eager to try again. I found another site that accepted bitcoin and was selling what I wanted and paid full price. And i got it a couple days later. I think getting what I order is more important than saving 15%.

If its the above, as your OP leads me to believe, then obviously my counter-example illustrates that network effect isn't everything.
Bitcoin is MySpace. So smugly sure of its position it does little to improve the experience for the user.
And the altcoins are facebook and reddit and every other social media platform. They're busy innovating to provide their users a better experience.
Edit: Meanwhile we have MySpace purists who try to make anyone who isn't also a MySpace purist feel like shit.

This is horseshit. I sent you something like six email over the next four or five months to remind you that you still hadnt done what you said you would do (send a pdf, via email, which you claimed to already have).
Furthermore, a year ago when you publicly admitted your failings and offered restitution you said I was one of the last, from PorcFest, you had to make whole. So either:
A: you lied about having already restituted the others you fucked (likely, considering what you currently say about 'other parties' muddying the waters)
B: you lied about intending to provide restitution, and actually **already** possessing some pdf that outlines such a proposal
It's hard trying to determine how to repair your reputation with someone who never gave you money? Bullshit. You never tried. You never asked me what I think would make me whole, nor did you ever make any sort of offer. Which, again, if you told the truth when you said you had already restituted others, sending me a similar offer, even just to get the ball rolling, should have been the definition of simplicity.
I don't believe a word you say, I don't trust you, and I expect nothing from you other than empty promises and more pronouncements of how wonderful you believe yourself to be. **That** is the reputation you worked so hard to earn.

To start the farm? I'm not the authority on this subject but I know a little/enough. No, it was actually an anti-economic decision. All four owners were making more money where they were previously. It was far more a quality of life decision. Farmers wake up early, and work hard, long hours (sometimes), but so long as you aren't in debt with the bank you pretty much have no one to answer to. The animals end up being your boss and setting your schedule, and dammit I've never been humiliated or talked down to by a pig/chicken/rabbit. So at the cost of making more money, they decided to establish a better life.


DIY. I can't really think of anything we got done "professionally". It's always us, or a friend, or a barter situation.


Inverters. I'd sure like to direct wire DC for LED lighting, however.


Yea, propane stove and fridge.


Yup, gas or diesel. We've been snatching up used veggie oil with the intent to produce bio-diesel for a while now. One day...


Sure we have A/C. From September to June...


Previously just about every night. Now we only run it when it's been cloudy for a couple/few days.


LED bulbs wherever. Yea, we have laptops, but no internet so they get used much less than they would otherwise. We've just setup some lights on timers for the quail and chicken, to get them laying through the winter. We have a clothes washer (which I've never used, I prefer the laundromat), but no dryer. Clothes line for that.


THIS. Want to do something off-grid? Ha! Never that easy. You always have to do something, before you can do something else, so you can finally do what you wanted in the first place. So yea, that environment totally encourages some outside the box thinking and solutions. It also changes me/us so when we're around 'normal' folk and their solution is just to plug something into the wall socket, I'm a bit blown away with the simplicity of grid living.

No. A mutual friend let me know that he wanted to donate heavily, mostly in printed materials. He promised me, the head organizer, pretty much all the printed materials I would need (brochures, maps, signs, etc). He also promised a half-dozen to a dozen (or so) vendors something very similar. Just one of us (afaik) actually got **some** of what he promised, and that guy says it was because he was a goddamn honey-badger when it came to hounding A.B. and his staff.
Me he totally shafted, and left me scrambling to cover my ass by paying way too much for rush print orders. The damn map cost over two grand...
"We" had a big "Fuck A.B. Dada" party after PorcFest. The mutual friend who suggested him to all of us was absolutely aghast at his behavior and apologized profusely for bringing him into our lives.
A year later I see him posting on a friend's facebook post about what a great and reliable guy he is, so I spoke up. He apologized, said I was one of the last people he had to make right, and just email him privately so we can make this happen. So, being a fool, I did. And he just dropped it like a ton of bricks. Much like he had done the year before.
Do you want a lot of hot-air blown up your ass?
If so, A.B. Dada is your man.

Well we are Bardo Farm in Croydon, NH. The property was purchased around six or seven years ago. It was already off-grid, and the cost to connect to the (electrical) grid would be in the low six figures. That's just not an option.
So the first solar array was installed. Iirc it was something like 650 watts, which we supplemented with a propane generator which came with the property, and a military surplus diesel generator. It was funny. When power is being drawn from the batteries it was all candles. But when the generators were running they would supply more juice than the charge controller could handle, so we scrambled to plug everything in and use the excess electricity.
Less than a year ago we replaced that array with a 3500 watt array. We also quite recently more than doubled our battery bank, and I think that puts us at needing more panels, lol.
We raise Yorkshire/landrace hogs (about 300 year, making us one of, if not THE, largest hog operations in NH, lol), free-range three or four hundred various laying hens, a hundred or so cornish cross roasters a year, maybe a hundred or so rabbits a year (trying to expand that, big time. Lots of demand), a thousand or so jumbo cortunix quail a year (I think we could do a few thousand more, but baby steps), less than 100 Jumbo Pekin duck this year but that will increase, ~50 Khaki Campbell ducks (for duck eggs), and we're delving into goat and sheep. We've previously raised a few emu, who have delicious meat. 50/50 emu/pork sausage makes a TERRIFIC hamburger.
We accept the ever loving hell out of bitcoin, but few of our customers use it or part with it. I think our only bitcoin transactions since signing up with a provider (BitPay? Shit I cant remember) were for the annual festival we threw in May. We sure as heck would like additional bitcoin transactions.
Any specific questions?

Well there **are** too many plea baggers. But it is also true that there are **far** too few actual trial lawyers willing to defend their client at all costs (again, thanks to lawyering being a self-regulating monopoly industry. Can't bite the hand that let's you set your own barrier to entry...).

He would be an absolute fool to accept a plea deal before having a few court dates. I know from experience that the offers get better and better the longer you refuse them and insist upon a trial.
Though what with this case being extra-special, I wouldn't put it past the government to offer basically nothing, banking on the value of a public persecution.

Dude, seriously, fuck you. You've contradicted yourself multiple times. I contacted you OVER AND OVER after calling you out publicly (which is the only way to get a response from you, apparently).
You made your bed. Sleep in it.

Hhhmmm, I work on a farm in NH. I wonder if there is something else I could send you? We have plenty of 'spare' pigs, but idk about shipping a pig/pork. I also have a ton of FSP Porcupine Gadsden flags sitting around, want one/some?

You don't go looking for a job that pays in bitcoin, you go looking for a job that pays. Then it's up to you to convince your employer to pay you in bitcoin. Good luck.

Ok, fuck it. I'm going to screenshot and post our private convos to out you for the sham you are. B- three years ago? You mean when you fucked everyone you dealt with in regards to PorcFest 2011? 
And an A- in the last two years? The same last two years in which you publicly (on fb) responded to my informing everyone else that you were nothing but hot air? Then told me and everyone else that you recognized your fuck ups and were/are working hard to make amends? Then asked me to privately message you and told me you had a pdf proposal to send me when you get back to the office... and then nothing? For months? No responses?
Seriously, I'm glad you're so proud of your name. It wouldn't have been nearly quite so easy to pm the people you were publicly making promises to, and informing them just how unreliable you are, if you weren't such a narcissist.

No. Insulting you is not even a blip on my radar.


I dont know how it would make me feel from either of my parent's basements. Also I don't think both parents own a basement, so we're just talking about how it would make me feel to do this in my father's basement. And he is many states away from me so I doubt I'll experiment with insulting you from his basement any time soon. I'd prefer to continue insulting you from my own domicile, thanks.

Idk, that watch says "bitcoin rich" and it wont be long before we stop calling them gold-diggers and start calling them coin-diggers.
Which opens up the possibility of being so poor you can only afford the watch, and creating your own hack app to display spot and your fictitious bitcoin holdings (holy shit, Bethany, his watch says he has TEN WHOLE BITCOIN! How do my boobs look?).
What a marvelous time we live in.
