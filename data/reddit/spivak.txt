I too look forward to a world where the only product is low cost high calorie food bars and vitamin supplements. Maybe this week we'll splurge and get a flavor packet.

Sounds good until the economic output of the country plummets since no-one is buying, no-one is hiring, and the already wealthy just sit on their cash.

Thank you for making me helplessly giggle at the idea of sending Wikipedia a sacred boulder as a donation.

But why would they want to do that? Why not create their own currency? It's delusional to think that a person wouldn't pick the banks currency because it's backed by a stable multinational bank.

I'm assuming most people here are talking about the US so I'll use that as my example. I think I would separate this issue into two cases: one where you were born there, and the other if you immigrated there. 
If you immigrated to the US then you very explicitly signed and agreed to be governed and bound by the laws of the United States during your immigration process. 
If you were born in the US then you are granted the full rights of citizenship on your 18th birthday. I would consider your agreement choosing to stay in the US after that.
I agree that implicit agreements make one party feel taken advantage of (see:[XKCD]( but the alternative is every person in the US having to apply for citizenship when they turn 18 which would be a bureaucratic nightmare.
