Hello there guys, welcome back to my laboratory, where safety is  priority.

Segwit is newer technology, needs less space on the blockchain, so its fees are lower.
Lightning is essentially a highway for some transactions: you pay a fee to go up, you complete your transactions with very low fees, then you leave the highway.
Traditional transactions are basic transactions: You pay a fee, if it is high enough, then miners will likely include your transaction in the next few blocks. If it is not, then your transaction will wait a few hours, and in times like this with the mempool flooded with 161k unconfirmed transactions, you will wait days or weeks.
BTC is the "original" Bitcoin, also called Bitcoin Core, which currently has a 1MB limit on blocks, and has SegWit activated. Supporters believe that BCH is climbing up on BTC's fame and it is just a chinese scamcoin or shitcoin. Attackers believe that BTC has shifted away from what Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin stood for and what is described in the whitepaper, they oppose SegWit and off-chain/second layer solutions, like the Lightning Network.
BCH is a fork of Bitcoin Core, effective from the 1st of August, 2017. Their stance is that the block size should be increased as the network load increases, that is why their block size is capped at 8MB. Supporters believe that this is the way that Bitcoin should've taken (instead of SegWit and Lightning Network), that is why they have forked from the original chain. Attackers believe that this fork is mainly controlled by chinese scammers and say that its leader, Roger Ver is just a criminal and the support behind it is just like a cult.
Coinbase doesn't implement SegWit, that is why it is attacked by the Bitcoin community, GDax is their own exchange, so transactions between these two sites are free and withdraws from GDax are, too. I don't know much else about this one.

I don't understand why people are crying about only ONE customer using the technology.
If ONE single entity can effectively kill the whole network for weeks, or even months, that network isn't at all usable.

You can move the original coins as the networks are separate.

Take a look at MPGH Marketplace or Bitcointalk, they have a lot of VCC sellers who accept Bitcoin. Be sure to deal through the site itself (in PMs at Bitcointalk and on the Instant Messenger at MPGH) to be eligible for protection in case it goes wrong.

I believe that BTC could be helpful for those people too, but as the western world lives on much more than that, the network has been fitted to their demands, because Bitcoin's fiat price rose so high.
Other altcoins however have way lower price points though, and their higher coin count (and less transaction volume) makes for a better cryptocurrency in practical usage for people who need very low or no fees (take Dogecoin, Reddcoin or DigiByte, sub-1-cent-fees).

That is its purpose. Fun internet money for tipping. Not meant to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:35:09
That is true, it way a misunderstanding on my part then. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:31:41
There are a lot of altcoins with working products for real life scenarios, no need to be hostile towards every one of them. Sure, ICO-s are mostly scam, but a lot of coins have promising technology (Monero, Ethereum, even Dogecoin serves a purpose). 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:32:25
Please calm down and try to answer this question: why not use Dogecoin or DigiByte instead of BCH? They both have lower block times, 1 min and 15 sec respectively, they have cheaper average fees than BCH, what is the upside of BCH? That it has Bitcoin in the name? If you created an altcoin from 0, you know that BCH wouldn't be anywhere, because it isn't any better than some altcoins, it just has Bitcoin in the name and it's a fork of BTC.

But can't it have inflation? Let me show you how I think with an example: ($ means I'm paying in USD, BTC means I'm paying in BTC).
I pay $2 for a cup of coffee today. Tomorrow, the merchant decides he needs to raise his prices to keep his shop running, so a cup of coffee will be $2.1. Soon, other people follow, and every shop raises prices by 5% in just a week. This means my $s are now worth slightly less than a week ago, this is, by definition, inflation.
The same can happen with BTC. A cup of coffee costs 0.0004 BTC today, but this isn't enough for the merchant, so he raises prices to 0.00042 BTC. Soon, every other business reacts and raises prices to keep up with the others on profits. This, yet again, leads to my BTC's purchasing power decreasing. Much like in the previous example, so this is inflation, too.
BTC can do nothing to protect us against inflation, so I think it is even worse than governments, because no one controls it, so hyperinflation or hyperdeflation are both possible in the case of extreme or no demand.

I'm sorry, but your misspellings are funny as hell, I don't mean no harm.
It's litigate and argue, aren't they?
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:29:45
It looks like the Heineken logo, so yeah, you are in the wrong here. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:31:08
But the value of BTC is irrelevant here, as we were talking about purchasing coffee in plain USD and in plain BTC, not by combining the two.
Your comment is applicable when you still measure money in USD and you pay in BTC by converting the amount you want to pay by looking at the exchange rates, but I was talking about a plain BTC world where we don't view the dollar amount anymore.

The Blockchain, which remembers every transaction's every input and output forever and ever. This is the way it was designed.

Guess I got lucky! I often have problems with ATMs though, they run out of cash right when I'm in a hurry!

Tether's market position is based on users' faith in their transparency, I haven't researched the recent audit, but I have seen some pictures that allegedly show that the auditor company has connection with Tether's company owners, which is alarming.
If Bitcoin grows, its price will likely increase as well, which means that everyday items' prices won't fluctuate that much, that is correct, yes.
But I don't agree with your point on stability. For everyday purchases, you are likely still using high liquidity assets (cash &amp; credit cards), while for investments, properties, stocks and securities are the way to go. But you need stability in your everyday life, you can't pay for bread and milk with an asset that is worth +-10% of its value the previous day.
I don't think crypto will ever take over, as there are many upsides to banks and government issued money as well, but they will probably be more incorporated in our everyday life.
@_date: 2018-07-08 08:30:36
True, but my point was that it would be hard for merchants to use assets whose value fluctuates a lot, how would a shop price bread when its value in BTC changes from 0.00001954 to 0.00002021 in 10 minutes? (I just pulled those numbers from thin air)
I'll be checking out Dai, thanks for the tip!

Spending BTC costs more, takes more time and is less convenient than credit cards or cash.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:45:24
But a lot of monetary government functions depend on the ability to issue currency, like the control of inflation through balancing the monetary base (the amount of printed currency in circulation). And our current economy depends on a stable currency (which Bitcoin will never be, because its value can hyperinflate or hyperdeflate in rough conditions, thus it can become useless), this is why crypto can never replace fiat completely.

Pornhub pays you for uploaded videos. If you want, you can livestream on Chaturbate and it makes you a lot more, if you take requests for tips.

Personally, I never had an issue with card payments, in fact, I had more problems waiting for my transactions to confirm in times of congestion on the network.

I'm actually doing it sideways.

is a carbon copy of this sub, add hate posts and "BCH is better because we changed a 1 to 8 (and now 32)", poof.
