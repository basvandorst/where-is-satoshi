What point are you trying to make? Because if you are implying that firearms regulation doesn't make places safer based on a single instance I would work on your arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:49:31
What? Firstly we were explicitly talking about gun deaths so why would that statistic be meaningful similarly why would you compare all violent crimes when we were discussing gun deaths? Secondly, what are you suggesting re the history of both countries? I suppose thirdly can you point to any meaningful statistics to suggest that england's gun control has been a failure in comparison to the US's? As you heavily implied. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:07:35
Again we were explicitly talking about gun control here not violent crime. I would still believe the UK would have less serious violent crimes per capita than the US but I am open to being proved wrong with sourced stats. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:21:03
So you believe that gun deaths per capita are as high in England as the US?
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:11:30
Tell me what suggests that to you oh wise one or are you just shifting the conversation to insults because that's all you've got? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:41:07
Your last sentence. Can you provide any sourced stats for this?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:31:34
"This is GOOD for bitcoin!!1!"
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:12:17
However there is no incentive to spend money in a deflationary situation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:50:51
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:36:34
What are you talking about? Never said I called shit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:49:00
Well if you don't already see it...
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:35:16
Is English not your first language?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:24
Notice how people aren't explaining. Just saying no...
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:51
I'm not talking about the investment advice. The atmosphere here was downright bizarre.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:22:38
What can you buy with bitcoin at the moment?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:05:27
Yeah it does. You believe I'm a condescending hater and I said feel free to believe it if you want. I'm not hiding anything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:32:57
It's almost as if it doesn't make sense to use a deflationary currency to buy stuff. How interesting.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:36:22
Bitcoin working and it's value don't have to be linked!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:15:21
You spend far too much time on reddit for me to believe either of those things. Best of luck to you though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:17
By all means feel free to believe whatever you want to believe about me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:48
Impressive at your age. Still don't believe you especially the way you talked about them dying (didn't read like any death I've witnessed, also windows that you can open in a ressus room?!?) but whatever, I'm off, enjoy your life whether its reality or a concocted story for reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:27:12
Nah, I'm from all. An outsider. What brings me here and fascinates me is the cultish rhetoric.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:19:11
Comments like this is why people laugh at this sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:26:54
[As I understand it, transfers that haven't gone through yet due to either high fees or full mempool.](
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:24
He's right. It's like a cult in here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:48:22
Yes I can but even if I couldn't wouldn't it be really easy to Google making this a stupid way to verify my knowledge?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:43
Not true there was the atmosphere here of a mlm knife sales company party around here. It was bizarre. Not like normal communities.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:35:46
This is frighteningly cultish.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:12
Or 300k unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:08:50
Urging sanity about the cultish behaviour. Never claimed I knew shit about what the price was going to be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:36:46
Something better is always on the horizon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:34:45
I would also find it odd for a director of a company to worth that kind of capital to be working as a nurse or care assistant.
Also people who go through what your claiming you went through last night wouldn't typically talk about it so flippantly the day after in an unrelated conversation on a financial sub.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:27:16
With really slow transaction times and really high fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:22:27
I'm not a hater and I don't hold any coins or any short positions. I've just been trying to urge sanity here for the last few weeks. The cult like behaviour of this sub has had me fascinated/worried for you guys.
While I'd be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed a little schadenfreude please don't base decisions on your financial futures on memes or fanatical group think.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:23
Different communities converse in different ways. The way this sub communicates is downright cultish...
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:35:38
They didn't say they knew anything other than that bitcoin is volitile which is demonstrable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:20
Nah. But I do laugh at the_Donald and this place was as cultish as there a few weeks ago. It's after improving here in the last few days from what I can see though. Legitimate criticism is no longer seen as heracy here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:25:39
The comments are downright cultish in general in this sub...
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:41:45
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:44:02
What chart do you recommend?
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:39:05
Or you and your holdings will be lying in chalk.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:43:31
This is good for bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:47:41
You bought some to push the price over a milestone? My god this place is in for some awakening.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:35:59
God the comments here read like some weird cultist stuff. Very bizarre.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:46:46
You bought some to push the price over a milestone? Jesus fucking christ this place is fucked.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:11:29
You sound like a dodgy knife salesman.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:57:33
All the difference in the world. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:12:34
Lol, pathetic.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:36:00
I've always found my arguments carried a lot more weight when I called someone a heck of a dumb dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:14:09
Good question.
Or am I still lying? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:11
No one knows. Anyone telling you they know is lying.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:18:38
What's absolute bullshit? You thought this was a guaranteed money maker? Or are you calling the tech bullshit?
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:27:41
Because this place was like MLM knife sales company during the days after the initial breaking of 10k. It was bizarre.
