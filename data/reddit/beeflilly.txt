My dad thinks it’s too late to buy. I keep telling him it’s not.
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:03:57
Yeah just a Tesla for me. Either the model 3 or the X
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:01:34
Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:37:20
He definitely bought Bitconnect lol
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:26:30
I’m not selling for fiat. If at some point I can buy a house with bitcoin then I’ll be happy.
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:07:20
Brian takes fat dumps
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:52:41
Yeah I get that. But not everyone wants to here a shitty loud car.
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:51:47
Classic 2017 alt season.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:16:45
Only here for lambo
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:30:02
Very true. In response to your “Tesla ain’t beating a demon” comment. It’s pretty damn close. 
Also, once the Tesla Roadster comes out, nothing will beat it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:33:42
[Here’s what I could find ](
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:06:26
What movie is this from?
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:09:43
Then buy more!
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:23:32
You just now mentioned the GTR. And of course I don’t think that. Nissan GTRs sound incredible. So do Lamborghini’s, Ferrari’s, and others like it. Also, they aren’t loud, only loud when they are opened up. I’m talking about actual shitty loud cars. But I still think electric cars are going to eclipse expensive cars like the above mentioned in every category. But that’s just like, my opinion man.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:38:46
I too bought at 12.4k but I am just enjoying watching the amount of BTC I hold grow. I keep buying as the price continues to drop. But I also keep buying as it continues to grow sooo.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:24:26
I had these guys tell me all about it so many times but never did any research for myself. Then in 2017, I did a quick google search of the price, (the first time I ever did) and saw that it was over 5k. Educated myself then finally got in. Then got rekt by my alts haha
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:13:23
Can’t wait to be one of those hoarding rich folks!
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:39:56
It’s all in the knees. If you time it right you will go higher.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:25:15
Buy the dip bro.
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:09:14
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:04:42
I mean I bought at 12.3K and I’m sleeping fine at night. Haha
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:07:04
okay this is really fun to watch!
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:29:33
Ye of little faith
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:04:44
Plus, Tesla’s have better acceleration than any other car. Especially if you have it in ludicrous mode
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:46:17
Listen to your mummsyyy

I want to upvote you but you’re at 420 upvotes. So I’m torn
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:55:34
I also like this.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:45:44
I hope to see this in the decade to come!
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:22:21
Damn bitcoin dominance just keeps increasing. Cool to see!
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:05:50
I love that movie!
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:49:41
Well are you in it now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:18:59
That would be insane to witness 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:57:25
Haha funny name but no one wants to stay in Bakersfield...
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:14
Username checks out 
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:18:49
Asking the real questions here! 
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:41:19
Ahh yes. Lofi hip hop: beats to stare at charts, panic sell, and get rekt to.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:22:38
Lol this is nothing.
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:04:14
Pointless? Yes. But it’s fun to watch even if you’re HODLing
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:29:03
Love me some sub 10k bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:02:29
Lol @ “warned”. I’ll take the bitcoin discount TYVM
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:25:36
Someone is bitter
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:29:59
I think he’s referring to March.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:20:51
No no no. Buy low, BUY lower.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:38:02
Seriously though
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:48:59
I’m really curious as to how long you’ve been invested. This is Bitcoin. It do what it do. Nothing has changed. It goes up, it goes down, it’s not a pump and dump. Just hold the efff on dude. 
Everyone wants to see big gains, why do you think there are 1.1M in this sub? Patience patience patience.
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:00:40
Well this is all still pretty new. I feel over the next decade adoption will gain some serious momentum! And that’s me thinking conservatively
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:34:26
Is this 3D printed? I love it
@_date: 2019-08-08 09:23:33
Hoping we choose Andrew Yang!
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:52:58
Can’t argue with that!
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:23:29
I just saw a similar sign at a place in Flagstaff
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:02:32
No Mans Sky Beyond comes out tomorrow so I'll get some then!
@_date: 2019-08-08 07:31:59
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:12:06
finally got a purchase to go through!
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:43:55

I miss those memes
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:01:47
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:03:55
*clears throat*
It hit 10,000
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:40:31
You didn’t by any chance play WoW did you?
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:59:49
320 million
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:52:36
Everyone’s moon is different
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:26:25
I’ll happily take another chance at some sub 10k Bitcoin one last time!

Wiggins. I haven’t heard that since high school haha

Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:23:31
I was just high AF staring at the post trying to figure out the damn caption and how gummy bears related to Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:09:25
Okay but he’s still Johnny Depp. Lol still rich AF. Still an amazing actor. Good for his maid though
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:12:31
Season 1 Episode 10
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:09:46
Like every sci-fi movie uses Units. Why can’t we use that?
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:52:44
Check out iota!! 
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:28:54
You must be new here.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:05:24
I️ like units
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:17:17
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:57:31
He’s lost to the bubble theory now.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:32:33
Same here! Cheers to you. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:13:03
Fuck him hard
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:21:59
Yes he does. He loses the bet if it doesn’t hit 16k. Assuming the price continues to climb towards the moon but falls short of 16k by his prediction, he will still pocket a healthy profit. Even after losing and buying his friend the bottle of Glen. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:08:55
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:52:11
same hahaha
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:45:27
I’m not sure. But he’s referencing an old famous quote. “The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. The next best time is now.” - I forget who the quote was from
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:48:28
If you believe it will surpass 100k in the coming years, then none of this current price action really matters. 
Edit: Bitcoin is very volatile. That will always be true.
