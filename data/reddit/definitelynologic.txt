For a currency like this one that is declining/being abandoned, why is anyone buying this for bitcoin at all?

FWIW, I ordered a Ledger Nano S in early August, and it said it wouldn't ship until Sept 3rd- but ended up shipping about 2 weeks after ordering instead of a month. You would most likely get it a decent amount earlier than what they quote. Guessing it's just an over estimate on their part for safety. I love the Nano S btw.

Can you tell me what this is from? I realize no one can know the outcome, but why does this comment hold any value to you?

What if the person is American, but purchased all their bitcoin while living in the UK?

If only Reddit gold/silver could be transferred into Bitcoin! I’ve never sold bitcoin, only used it to buy things a few times.

Ha, I had a feeling, but sometimes 'industry terms' can be wacky like that.

Can you elaborate on the meanings of these and how to read them on a chart? Looking to understand charts better. We can take it to DM if you'd rather. Cheers.

Got that same problem.... But I suppose if they go through we will end up better in the end as the price rises.

Same. Went to Kraken after yesterday being fed up with not being able to buy, but Kraken hasn't verified my info for 2 days. I'm missing the dip to buy!
