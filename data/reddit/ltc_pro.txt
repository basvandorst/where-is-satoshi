Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get anything back. Please note that I did not have any crypto - I only had USD funds in my account (from selling my crypto, and was waiting for a drop so I can re-buy).
I have accepted that WEX/BTC-E is a scam. It's just a matter of when they will scam you. The moment they do, there is nothing you can do, and they will not help.
I'm sorry to hear the same has happened to you. If you have better luck with them than me, please let me know.

Yep - just tried to log in to BTC-e and experiencing the same issue. I have funds there, and apparently, the information they ask you to provide is enough for them to steal your identity.

Well, they changed their process. Previously, you had to send documents to btc-e.com and wait for someone to verify your documents are true and sufficient to unlock your account.
Now, they want everything to go through xbtc-e.com. My documents have been uploaded for 2 weeks, and have only gotten automated responses telling me to wait.

I wish I had known that they ban for inactivity. Had I known that, I would have never used them...

I have opened multiple tickets already. Always the same "we are backlogged" answer. Finally got a "we will try to verify you within 48 hours" but that was a week ago. Still not verified :|

I'll wait another week and see what happens. If still banned, then I'll try the troll box. Will keep everyone posted.

That's good to know. How long ago was this? I've been trying for a few weeks now.

Wait.... what? When my account was suspended, I was told I have to sign up at xbtce.com, get verified there, then they can link the account to btce.com, and unban my account. This is 2 months going now, and my account is still not verified at xbtce.com. HOW DID YOU GET VERIFIED IN A WEEK????

Yes - many accounts have been banned due to inactivity. I did not know this, and did not use my account for over a year. I have unused funds in the account.
All I read about are others with this issue. I've never seen anyone say they have successfully reclaimed access to their account.
