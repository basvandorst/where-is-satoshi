That is not the whole story: a bitcoiner cannot profit directly from promoting bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no company behind it.
All other coins are useless shitcoins with no use case and none of them is decentralized. There are companies with marketing divisions behind them and those companies profit directly if they sell you their scamcoin.

good point. I was ignorant when the internet came alive in the 90ies. thought it was a hype. did not understand it at all. felt ashamed later. jeez, I was so wrong.  told myself that when the next big tech is rising I will dive into it. had my "I´ve-seen-the-light-moment" in 2013 regarding bitcoin due to reddit and bitcointalk and on andreas youtube. 
my failure in the 90ies became visible for me when I was confronted with the dotcom bubble. those stocks....  my mantra was "it is a hype". of course I finally could not resist in also investing. of course on the very top of the dotcom bubble. because I had no knowledge what I was doing.

well, i sort of disagree. problem is that either side sees itself as the rational one, and it is exactly your kind of non-compromise attitude that brought us into this mess. (nothing personal) we should not give up finding a compromise as a community. what bitcoin has achieved has never been done in history. we are dealing with humans and not machines. we need to embrace the other side. charlie shrem is, imho, trying to do exactly this. don´t shrug it off as being "non-technical"

same here. well said. i can subscribe to all of what OP posted. bought my first coins in 2011, but for the first time i am really afraid that this is the end. for the first time i am seriously considering to sell all and leave crypto. alts? never! 
thinking about some kind of initiative of average users that tries to get the main actors on a table to figure out a compromise. seems naive, i know. but maybe better than doing nothing. we all lost 10% just today. maybe we should invest 1% in funding an initiative to tell the big guys they need to get together.

i also strongly agree. on the other hand the BU camp doesn´t view segwit as the compromise that they want. is it completely out of the range of possibilities to do 2 MB &amp; segwit as a peace offer? i know segwit IS raising blocksize, but BU camp seems not to buy it. would we lose so much to reach out and find a compromise? i am getting scared here. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:18:17

you assume a lot here. it could be at least tried to be discussed with the BU camp as a peace offer. if they still rage against core after a an offer like this, we haven´t lost anything but at least tried to solve the problem. if they start to say no to what they always said they want, then you are right. making an offer for the sake of resolving this fuck up would not hurt, imho.

again, i find your words convincing. thank you for taking your time and answering. i think BU is dangerous, i am very much pro core. those guys write awesome code. now, after all the years that we waited for to break the old ATH, now that it finally has been achieved, this drama takes place and is about to kill first the uptrend and then maybe the entire project. a compromise should be found. i wonder if some core devs can imagine to take the burden and discuss a compromise? what can i do to help finding one? i am seriously considering calling out for an initiative of users of this great protocol. an initiative that tries to help finding an compromise. to achieve a compromise both sides need to swallow some bitter pill. i don´t think that from the community side core devs would lose their face or dignity if they would take this responsibility. on the contrary they would be seen as heros who saved the protocol. 
i know it is hard to address "core" because they are no company or fixed group. but for the sake of the unprecedented brilliance of this project and for what it could deliver for humankind - monetary freedom for the masses, which is fucking great on a historic scale - core should not risk this because they are right. greatness is more than being right.  i urge core devs to swallow the bitter pill and find a compromise. 
and all others that are not directly involved. step back and try to support a compromise by stopping to pour gasoline in the fire. let us stand together and stop hating each other, stop attacking each other with words. everyone can contribute towards a happy end of this drama by cooling the hate. it is not too late.

some scientists calculated that bitcoin cannot work as a currency because it is too safe. the overall sum of btc is capped. but the stupidity of users is not capped. losing/forgetting/fucking up are just some possibilities. or folks that own bitcoin, but since they want to keep them safe, do not tell anyone how to get them out of cold storage, and then have an accident or a heart-attack or whatever - a situation where they are suddenly not capable to pass down their coins.  in the study it was concluded that even if only a few % per year get lost, in 50 years there will be not many left....   = just another moon attack vector that is not priced in...

Very good article!  The bitcoin community was way to neglectful/naive towards the shitcoins in the past. Maybe thinking that competion is always good which is true when it is necessary to find out which protocol to use. But bitcoin has won long ago and what is lacking is some theories about how it happened that btc dominance is at only 50% while non of the shitcoins have delivered anything but bitcoin is up and running for a decade now with no downtime. All other cryptos are airline miles. Worse, people usually don’t get scammed by marketing divisions to buy airline miles.
You stated some interesting theories. Do you think there is a need for a broader discussion about the shitcoin phenomena and how it hurts the bitcoin community? Do you think shitcoins are hurting the bitcoin community?

where i live all the eggs that are sold in supermarkets are individually stamped with dates/codes for consumer protection and transparence. of course, those stamps and labels could be easily forged. scandals about bad quality/rotten eggs happen, but no knows what to do. i thought this is a fucking brilliant use case for bitcoin. have the honest producer use certain known colored coins to follow the egg through life cycle. simply print individual bitcoin adresses on individual egg. thought about how bitcoin help us reduce all the ongoing yucky scandals in the food industry. came close to get a start-up going. but one night it dawned on me: the fucking idea is absolutely useless. the problem is that the malicious egg producer/seller can just do the same. use bitcoin. how could the consumer know the difference between my super epic ethic egg/bitcoin company and bad guy selling rotten eggs? we would need a trusted party that verifies the producer. so, no gain.

They are the lender of last resort. If they don’t confidentially state that they would print their asses out of any crisis the speculators in the government bonds market would smell weakness and start to lose confidence in the ECBs ability to keep things going. That would raise interest rates and make it more expensive for governments to finance their budgets.  If the ECB says we will print as long as needed, attacking speculators have no chance.

there have been less than ten days in the history of bitcoin where people decided to buy and - if they held up to this point - are actually in the reds currently.
if you are a bit hesitant, buy in 5 even chunks every few weeks. 
be prepared that price can go down the moment you invest. i bought my first coins  multi-year peak. felt like an idiot for y e a r s!

you are not the first bitcoiner who lost 2/3 of his stash due to stupidity. you still got 200 btc. when bitcoin hits $8100 you are at least where you started in terms of dollars. 
here is your problem: when you buy back the 200 btc with your alts, some alts will go through the roof. when you don´t buy back, btc will go through the roof. 
either keep those bitcoins and hodl from now on, or invest another few million $ to buy back the 400 btc you lost. 
if I would have the $ I would buy back. and stay away from alts. get a tattoo on your index fingers to remind you.

two years later someone approached me and kept talking about bitcoin with glowing eyes. he told me bitcoin went up to more than $60. it then dawned on me that i had already bought 100 of those coins. i told him the exchange got hacked and i have no account info whatsoever. he suggested to write customer support. i did. two hours later i had my account restored.

you are right. it is burdensome to actually buy bitcoin without all the KYC/AML crap. the burden is put there by laws, not by the bitcoin protocol.

there is an 9 year old new asset class and it is having the bull run off the century and it is not likely to stop right now! it´s called bitcoin! buy back when it dips, let the loss be a reminder for you and hodl harder. believe me, you are not the only one. I would even say that the majority of the current bitcoin hodlers did mistakes like this. if you don´t buy back you need to be able to not get bitter when price rices to $10k.
on the other hand, bitcoin could crash tomorrow and your decision would be smart - we never know. so don´t take it as an investment advice.

the first time i bought bitcoin was in 2011. paid $30 for one coin. you might think now that that was cheap and that i must have felt great.        boy, no.    
$30 was the very top of a bubble that did burst right after i bought. my investment went down the drain week after week, month after month. it went down all the way to $3 dollars. i had "lost" 90%.
next time i bought was in may or june 2013. i went all in. i had learned a little and bought after the april 2013 peak for $120 per coin.   again, you might think that i was a lucky bastard and that it felt great.     boy, not at all.
bitcoin price went down from the moment i had bought.  it went down to less than $70 per coin, my investment was worth almost half of what it was at the beginning. let this sink in: you throw precious $10k towards some insanely abstract, completely virtual and overhyped internet thing and a few months later those $10k are worth only $6k. you will feel like a complete idiot, trust me. then again, it might be a chance of a lifetime. i have not sold my stash.
do you think i am complaining today? 
if you are ready to see your $10k be worth only $1k or $5k for some time in between, then go for it. and keep in mind that it could go to zero also, and stay there. 
and: please do not keep the bitcoins at the exchange. sooner or later they all get/got hacked. buy a trezor or ledger hardware wallet, write down the seed in handwriting and let these words never ever be entered into a device that could be connected to the web.

my advice would be to try to get them to understand that bitcoin is a major technological breakthrough that needed decades to be solved. take a deeper look at this:
if one isn´t capable of recognizing that this is a major technical improvement, then it is hard to like bitcoin. then it looks like magic internet money.

ask him how important the thinks the internet as an invention is. remind him that until 2009 the internet was only able to re-organize the transfer of information. only information, that alone changed the world, but in most applications it is still hard to monetize this transfer of information. that is the reason why the internet is so full of advertisement, it almost chokes itself to death.
now, with bitcoin it is - for the first time in history - possible to transfer value via the net. the internet itself can be monetized now. and all this p2p, open-source, permissionless....
decentralized trust/transfer of value via bitcoin is in the same ballpark of technical invention as the gutenberg printing press.

great idea! i did the same. all of a sudden you start seeing bitcoinwisdom on your office screens everywhere... 
i just told my employees to get a mobile wallet like mycelium. 
if you plan to give out more than one btc per employee, order one trezor (hardware wallet) for each person. tell them to write down the seed in handwriting and not to lose the seed and not to punch it in any device that could be connected to the web.

you did well. you will sleep better. and yes, you will need to write down the seed word list. never ever punch this list into any device, write it on paper. several times. do not store the seed word list anywhere close to your trezor. some people divide their seed lists and store them literally hundreds of miles apart from each other.

last time i wired $50k from one european country to another i had to visit my bank several times. filled out forms forever. since the money was for bitcoin miners i was kinda nervous how fast it would get to the company. after one week it did not arrive. i asked my bank. nothing to worry they said. after two weeks it still did not arrive. i went to my bank. "don´t you worry." they said. after THREE weeks i was getting mad. i went to my bank. i asked where my money is and why it is taking so long. they did some research. we met again. they said they were sorry but they did not know where my money was and what happened to it. it finally did arrive at the company after FOUR weeks. ant it was expensive.

they all liked it very much. some decided to sell theirs, some got interested to buy more. 
prepare them that the value of their present could take a dive. i have the feeling that bitcoin owners get a bit euphoric when there was a larger rise. they give away bitcoins easier because of euphoria. sometimes that means bitcoin price is currently peaking and that the value will go down.  if we are next to a big rise your employees will have some great fun with them. if there is a drop now great fun could be delayed for some months.

Blockchain is just a way to structure data. It is nothing. A buzzword. No use case for blockchain yet, eventhough banks have invested billions of $ - nothing came out of it, it is just a marketing buzzword.

Altcoins are shitcoins are scamcoins.  They have no use case, they lack the strong security of bitcoin. Alts are just marketing departments trying to make a buck. Alts are down 90% with no recovery (why would a shitcoin recover?), btc is down 80% and has a proven history in recovering several times. Investment in btc is compared to altcoin investment way less risky.

mt gox went belly up in 2014. 
regarding op´s story: in 2013 a customer came into my shop and was all exited about some online money that he was "mining". he came back the following days more and more exited, telling me he would quit his job. I asked again wtf he was talking about. he mentioned mt gox. NOW THAT rang a bell. that was this japanese online scam that I had fallen for and lost $3000 way back in 2011. I had wired money to tokyo, bought on the very top of the 2011 bubble exactly 100 btc. from that moment on the price tanked and tanked and tanked. then mt gox got hacked and I gave up. threw away my account info, password, e v e r y thing, felt so ashamed for my stupidity and told no one. tried to forget the whole thing. (successfully). 
when that customer walked in in 2013, price was around 60$. he showed me. I got mad because my lost coins were worth more than $6000! he told me to write customer service. I did. half an hour later I had my account restored, 100 btc back. amazingly responsible company I concluded.

It is very hard to not get influenced by the altcoin marketing army.  they want your money, if you buy their altcoin they profit directly and you end up with worthless shit.  Bitcoin is risky but altcoins are orders of magnitudes more risky.

my whole life was a fucking uphill battle about money. decades of rat race, no end in sight. bitcoin is a "once-in-a-lifetime" historic event. it pulled me out of this grinding battle. thank you, mr satoshi nakamoto and thank you, r/bitcoin crowd and bitcointalk crowd. without you this dream would have never come true.

how do you think the price should move from relatively small to relatively big WITHOUT RISING? even if mediocre mass adoption happens, price needs to rise way more. are you butthurt because you do not posses enough bitcoin?  if this tech should go mainstream price needs to explode. what is so hard to understand about it?

welcome to bitcoin! 
i recommend to start with getting some small amount of bitcoin and practise with several wallets and maybe exchanges to see where you feel most comfortable. anything less than one or two btc can probably be dealt with smart phone apps like mycelium. if you consider to own more than one or two bitcoins it is better to use a hardware wallet like trezor. they are for sale at $99 and are safe, even when you flush it down the toilet. trezor is imho as comfortable to use as a smartphone app.
start browsing reddit/bitcoin and get an account at bitcointalk forum. this will make a big difference. don´t get scared or angry with sometimes unfriendly talk vs newbies.  
watch Andreas Antonopoulos videos on youtube, as many as you can. he has a great way of explaining the broader picture and the elegance and importance of the bitcoin revolution. 
if you invest in bitcoin: be prepared that the price can go down also, only invest what you can afford to write off. 
if you invest in bitcoin, holding (bitcoin slang is: hodling) is the best way to keep your funds. daytrading and /or shifting to altcoins is imho not the way to go. 
as soon as you own bitcoins you will notice that all sorts of people will try to talk you into "investing" your coins with really "brilliant" ideas. don´t listen to them, all they want is your coins. keep your coins, if you own bitcoins you already have an excellent investment. don´t try to invest your investment.
be prepared to get totally sucked into this great idea. financial freedom for the masses. open-source, peer2peer, permissionless, secure, fast...  
welcome and good luck!

If I understood Slush correctly they are currently working on integrating shamir’s secret sharing. next would be coinjoin integration and then considering btc only firmware. When I asked about the schedule (btc only firmware) he said maybe autumn.  It would surely help if trezor users contact Satoshi Labs and tell them that they would love this feature.

profit is not an objective concerning this. it would add hashing power to the fraction of miners/pools that supports core, which gives attackers a harder time. it would keep the network more secure. bitcoin would literally pay its own developers through an initial investment by its community.

no problem. The bearwhale sold all @ $300 and bought back in when it was over $1k 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:35:45
got in in March 2013.  Saw btc rise from $60 to $260 in a matter of weeks. wow. Bought more in the summer of 2013 just to see it rise to $1200.  WOW.  thought I mastered it all. when prices dropped and the multiyear bear came I expected it to last just a few months, like the first one I experienced. 
Didn’t. Sell. All. The. Fuckin. Way. Down. 
I was a permabull. but then, in January 2015 it came down to $200. my average buy-in was $125.  since I knew I couldn’t stand the fact that soon I will be left with no profit, I folded and sold.  the btc veterans  laughed at me for selling at the bottom.  was able to trade back almost my initial stash in the following months. Sworn myself to not let this happen again. this time around I sold 2/3 of my stash for $8.5k (I know, way too late. It was so hard to let those coins go....) Bought back some yesterday. feeling relaxed. Looking forward to buy more around the $3k level. 
What is hard for me to tell is the absence of this complete horror crushed fucked up feeling of loosing it all this bear market around: is it due to the dry powder I have to buy back in lower or is this bear market not even closely as bad as the 2013-2015 bear was - yet?

the report is mind-blowing. it criticizes bitcoin somewhat and even warns the bitcoin community but overall it shows a lot of respect for the idea, the devs, the community, the network. 
it is even arguing that in a traditional financial boom and bust cycle shouting "this time it is different" was always wrong, but concerning bitcoin it could be right for the first time.
it admits that attacking bitcoin only makes it stronger. it states that traditional economists have problems understanding it. 
but the most incredible part is when they discuss the statement: "bitcoin is dead"

It is about time the btc community starts to tell the world what a piece of shit most altcoins are. people get bombarded with lies of the shitcoin marketing industry and there is no one telling them the truth.  Don’t get me wrong: competition is good. But 3000 marketing departments equipped with tons of cash scamming regular people for more cash vs bitcoin with no voice and no marketing at all is not competition. It is defrauding people big scale. The bitcoin community has to raise its voice.  I am glad at least the bitcoin maximalists are getting aware of this.

i dont think it was arrogance. they stepped in when there was a dangerous interuption of getting segwit approved by 95% of hashing power. they came up with a compromise and it worked. the second part of the compromise, the hardfork segwit2x, is now outdated and seems not to have consensus. so they should abandon it.

people that hodl their bitcoins will advise you to keep your btc because they think it will rise further. people that have missed a chance to buy bitcoin (or have sold/lost/spent them) will tell you to sell them. 
15 btc is a lot. imho you should keep as many as possible since the upward potential is still very high. 
be aware that you also own 15 bitcoin cash. you need to claim/split/seperate them from your bitcoin BEFORE you move your bitcoin to a hardware wallet or spend them or what ever. 
find out how to claim your b-cash before you do anything. 
congrats on your windfall. ask your uncle how much he would like to get back.

Check coinmarketcap.com. It currently lists 1624 shitcoins with absolutely no practical/daily/real-life use and bitcoin, which has been used since 2010, 24/7 with no downtime, used by millions of people, e-v-e-r-y day/hour/second, flawless, despite being constantly attacked all those years. 
1624 examples of the power of online marketing, absolute crab, fraud, pre-mined lies, pipe dreams with NO ACTUAL USE CASE, and one example of a revolutionary p2p network. 
How on earth can people compare a successful network with almost a fucking decade of uptime with 1624 shitcoin proposals that have neither users nor use cases? 
One is the Golden Gate Bridge - it works and is real and is stable. All others are fucking retards standing on Marshall’s Beach and showing you plans of a new/hot/faster/cheaper super bridge they want to build WITH YOUR MONEY.  Their pipe dream bridge will never get build, they compete against an existing bridge and on top of that also with the 1624 other nutheads/fraudsters/bitches that promise new bridges.

when you pay something with credit card you are sending not only all relevant private info about you (name, bank account, adress,etc...) but also the KEY that is needed to send money from your account. you send this information to all kinds of people you don´t know, all kinds of intermediaries around the globe, you don´t even know how many people. that´s why credit card fraud is so rampant. you send away the key with every little transaction. 
with bitcoin you send away basically nothing (not your name, not your adress and for sure NOT the KEY to your account) - if you are careful it will be very hard to find out who you are. the transaction itself is public to anyone.

welcome to the crazy world of bitcoin! invest only what will not kill you if you lose it. bitcoin is a wild animal and it is always possible that it goes down big time. 
get an account with one or several of the big exchanges. after purchase transfer your coins into a hardware wallet. (trezor or keepkey for example, not expensive, safe - even if your computer is infected with malware).
do not touch your bitcoin investment for several years. do not daytrade, the forums are full of people crying about their lost bitcoins due to day trading. do not invest your bitcoins in alts. bitcoins are already a high risk high yield investment. don´t try to invest your investment...   better leave it alone and watch it rise.
get an account at bitcointalk.org and/or other forums. read all day, it´s fun. watch as many andreas antonopoulos videos on youtube as you can. he delivers great insight. 
as soon as you own bitcoins be prepared that everyone wants your coins: especially the alt sellers want your coins, do not give em any of your precious btc. 
put half a coin on a mobile app wallet on your smartphone and play around with it. get familiar with the network and how it works. send some tiny amounts of coins to friends or family.
if you happen to buy at the top (happened to me before) do not panic, price will come back. worst case it takes years. (i have bought on the 2011 top and i had to wait until february 2013 for break even. that felt terrible. but now having bought btc for $30 does not really feel terrible anymore...) 
bitcoin is possible financial freedom for the enslaved masses. it is an epic technological break through. 
bitcoin means you are your own bank. you can transfer value to anyone on the planet with internet access, 24/7, all year, without any permission, without any government office or bank that can stop you, to anyone you want.  
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:58:26

very easy with mining: when you try to launder money with regular bitcoins you must purchase them. most of the times you need to identify yourself when you want to buy bigger amounts of btc. when you mine bitcoins, you have to purchase computer hardware which is not suspicious. the coins you mine are NEW, they have no trail to follow back.

so you want a bitcoin without companies? you are using companies every day in your life (hey, it´s just so... um... comfortable), but bitcoin has to stay clean of them so you can ride on the fluffy unicorn of idealism? if compromises aren´t possible in bitcoin, we as a community will never be able to embrace hundreds of millions of users or even billions. get real. it is a chance to end the scaling stalemate/debate/war and we should welcome it. hate and extreme siding will not help. imagine this motherfucker of endless fuck-up coming to an end. let´s do it.

be the gentleman you are, get a bitstamp account (not kraken, they got daily/monthly withdrawal limits), send your pounds to your account and shove it all in with a single market order! that is how i would do it. fuck the slippage, let the community have some fun, too... ;-)

i was expecting such a move. everyone with some btc on a bitstamp account was wondering why the price was so low in $ but much higher in €. the difference was up to $15 per btc. which means that if it was possible to sell your btc on stamp for € and then convert those to $ and buy back btc one could make money easily. bitstamp must have gotten a lot of requests by customers today to end this strange spread by letting them swap their €/$ accounts.  it is really incredible that bitstamp is able to react that fast. the moment this trading is allowed $ price for btc on bitstamp will jump to bitfinex level.

that is a brilliant idea. households/buildings that are heated using electricity might as well use the heat generated by bitcoin mining. if i would own a bitcoin mining hardware producing company i would design them in a way that they can be used in houses for that reason. it would also make bitcoin mining look less energy "wasting" and give it a better image. every electric heating device could be a miner.

it was a never-ending nightmare. all the gains melted in a multiyear downtrend. the "doom-bears" and "bitcoin-goes-zero-trolls" kept being right after every little uptick that gave us hope. 
lower lows, all the time. 
hellfuck i do not know how I survived it. my stash melted since I was over invested and needed to sell for expenses and other business related stuff. I always tried to postpone every bitcoin selling as long as I could, but it was always wrong because price went even lower and I had to use even more coins to achieve the amount of fiat needed. there were times I wanted to give up, I was loosing faith on several occasions. only because I did not find any better investment I stayed in. EVERYONE who knew I was in bitcoin told me to dump it. 
almost all through 2015 the doom sayers insisted that the downtrend is not over. and since they were right for such a long time, a lot of people believed them. 
it was hard. it was depressing. on the other hand it tought me a lesson in being humble. I had invested in july 2013 and by the end of November my investment had 10folded and I thought I was a fucking genius. not sure what would have happened if I had cashed out on top on dec 2013. maybe I would have done so via mtgox. maybe I would have blown it all for coke and hookers by now. those three years of waiting were character forming. I do not complain. but it has been a nightmare anyway.

well, you keep your theory and i keep my coins. risky? sure. delusional? that is what i keep hearing since price was around $25. i like your "only criminals" part. keep hearing that since silk road. any technology that let ordinary people trade their weed in times of "war on drugs" right under the eyes of the almighty inquisition must be powerful. 
your "realistic" thinking kept you from going all-in. must be painful to be so clever. i wonder how you can be serious to spill your fud into a bitcoin-forum, and arbitrarily put a limit of bitcoin price of $1000. because "market conditions".  if the market conditions you are having in mind had something to do with reality, price of btc would still be zero. but it went from zero to more than $650 as of today, despite of you nay-sayers. bitcoin is a technology. just imagine you could have invested in gutenbergs printing press in a way to profit from all books printed ever since then. or imagine you could have invested in the internet as a whole and got a share of that in 1993. of course there where tons of nay sayers, who did not see it coming. i know because i was one of them. maybe you should write less fud and buy more coins. you are wasting time and effort and all those posts will be worth nothing and buy you nothing. while my coins will buy me a house before 2020. i bet you a beer on that one.

the danger of hodling btc is only temporary. the fiat value of your btc can be down for some years.  the danger of trying to beat the market and sell/buy back is to end up with less btc and given the immense value it has reached, that is, most likely, permanent.
it is more painful to lose btc than to lose fiat value. That is why hodling is a good strategy.

I agree with you.

I am holding a part of an internet protocol. Internet of value. Imagine you could have bought shares of TCP/IP internet protocol in the early 90ies.  Huuuuuuge risk/reward ratio. Completely different from lottery tickets.  You are right about the lottery ticket analogy when it comes to ALTcoins.  They are even worse than lottery tickets.

If it was meant to be a way of payment, how do you think it should when there are not even 20 mio btc existing? Let’s assume a few 100 million people want to use it: the only way to do this if btc gains massively in value since those rare btc need to cover all the value of all the goods that those 100 mio people are buying.  And exactly to this much higher value btc needs to rise if it gets adopted by 100 mio people. The ride up to this much higher value is what you see: a volatile price finding period.  When there is a market, there is speculation. What is the problem? Other than through super massive price rises, btc cannot become mainstream.

i had (small) funds on mtgox when it collapsed (lost), (medium size funds) on bitcoin24.de when it got closed by authorities (recoverd), medium size funds on bitstamp when it got hacked (recovered), small size funds on bitcoin-central when it got hacked (recovered).
as you can see it took me a while to understand...

very good article. helped me to see the broader picture.
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:51:57
You really answered my serious and honest question.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:35:56
all i get out of this is that is 
1) dangerous, because no one really knows what is going to happen
2) far too complicated to understand for non-IT guys like myself
3) it produces uncertainty

Right. But if you run an entire commerce on 1 btc, this 1 btc has to have the same value as that economy.

i know that feels. i bought 100 btc at the 2011 peak not knowing what i was doing. when price went down for months i was so ashamed that i had thrown € 2.5 k towards a apparently japanese scam that i told no one about it. threw away mtgox account infos and forgot all about it until march 2013. 
you trusted this student (lol, this student was satoshi himself i guess), helped him, and now there is a big reward. i am glad someone like you got it and not those envying, distrusting idiots that do not believe your story. 
enjoy your luck, you deserve it.
by the way: in germany, if you held coins for more than a year, there is NO capital gains tax. moving over there might save you some 25 million $. that does NOT APPLY if you are a U.S. citizen. 
good luck. 
don´t say you don´t deserve it. you can help a lot of people with your wealth. if you stay responsible, i do not see why you are not the right guy for this job. well done!

valid point.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:48:43
now i understand. but to what website anyone wants to send $ 20k or more? usually large payments via bitcoin are between people, not just a website. anyway, with large sums at stake, pls confirm address via different channel (e.g. phone)
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:59:37
What is your point? 
You seem to be missing some basic knowledge about bitcoin. It is not at all „just another shitcoin“
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:32:45
it is easy: brazilian government wants to buy bitcoin large scale. but oil price is in down, so not enough cash. his duty is to try everything to keep the price down as deep possible as long as possible. ;-)
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:20:18
sounds scary somehow. The 7000 btc seem not to be their concern.
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:17:30
 &gt; "Either supply will decrease as miners shut down operations (see the effects of oil’s big drop over the last couple of years)"
 
that is wrong in so many ways. 
supply will stay the same for the next 4 years, no matter how many miners would shut down. it is self adjusting. if less hashing power is used, difficulty will lower accordingly.
furthermore: most miners are industrial style operations. those large scale miners needed to invest money to get going. NO INVESTOR would be so stupid to NOT have the halving calculated in, before they invested. since it was known from the beginning.
price has already doubled, miners are on the safe side already.

just tell him the fees are too damn high, we will never be able to transfer those coins to him... /s

if you use a trezor and first check if the address the trezor device displays is really the one you want to send to, and then, before actually pushing the transaction, checking again if the address on your pc screen is still the same than on your trezor, i do not see how malware can harm you. you need to get the target address from a different source than from your pc screen if it is for bigger transactions. 
i used to "copy&amp;paste" bitcoin addresses a lot. but now i made myself used to typing them in. i use several encrypted hw wallets, seeds split up and stored in different locations.

nice one! up vote.

Great answer. If selling btc was done easily for a hodler, he/she would be out of bitcoin = not a hodler anymore. hodlers go through the pain of multiyear bear markets but they keep their stash and get rewarded with unprecedented returns. 
If the pain of losing bitcoin is bigger than  the pain of losing fiat value of btc stash, then you got what it takes to become a hodler.

Oh great you were lucky enough to guess a temporarily performing shitcoin. They all get pumped. Most people lose money in this gamble. 
There is no such thing as „ecosystems“ that alts are creating. Alts are scams with no use case.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:01:32
yes, you should have invested in trezors, not altcoins.... 
jesus, I bought my first trezor for 3 btc.... 
it still works fine, I am a happy customer, too
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:43:01
How on earth should there be 5% out of several thousand that are useful? Only bitcoin is useful and 100% of the rest is a scam.
