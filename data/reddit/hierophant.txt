Buy 1 BTC at $700.
Buy another 1 BTC at $500.
You now have 2 BTC at a total cost of $1,200 ($700 + $500).
Therefore the average price of each BTC is $600 ($1,200 / 2).
This is called dollar cost averaging. The technique reduces the average price of your BTC so that you will return to profitability sooner. The trade-off is that you have more capital at risk ($1,200 vs $700).

GDAX is Coinbase's trading product. You can buy and sell there for no fee or just the taker fee (which is much less than 1.5%).

I've used a few cloud mining operations.
"Lifetime" contracts don't return their investment, even if the miner doesn't intend to be scam, because as soon as newer ASICs come out the old ones quickly become unprofitable to run. Since you can't predict what the lifetime will be it is foolish to buy these.
Term contracts (1 year, 2 year) can be profitable in terms of returning more coins than you put in, but in my experience the profit is quite low, risk can be high, and 2 years is a long time to lock up your coins.
I do, however find HashNest's PACMIC contracts very profitable, about 13% APR. This isn't really a mining contract, it's a variable rate loan to HashNest that they use to buy and run hardware. Everybody's interests are aligned and everybody profits.
At the risk of sounding like a HashNest fanboy, I'll also call out the unique and really compelling feature of their traditional hash contracts: They provide a marketplace where you can buy and sell hash power with other HashNest users. This gives you a way out if you decide cloud mining isn't for you. And, since the price people will pay for hash power goes up and down with the price/enthusiasm around Bitcoin, it's possible to buy hash power low and sell it higher.
All that said, I don't bother using HashNest's traditional hash product anymore because the PACMIC serves me so well. It quietly grow the coins I'm hodling by 13% a year.
Of course if HashNest/Bitmain goes belly up, I'm toast.

The copyright date is the date the content was first published (or the copyright was applied for) not the current date. There is nothing interesting about the date not changing.

The problem isn't the wallet. That's like blaming Fed-Ex for charging you more to overnight $100 worth of pennies than a $100 bill. It obviously costs more to move pounds of copper than an ounce of paper.
This problem is with the structure of Bitcoin when you accumulate small payments in a wallet.
Some exchanges will allow you to deposit mining transactions, and only charge their fixed fee to withdraw. Some don't (because it's expensive for them, just like you).
Lightening networks supposedly fix this, but they aren't up and running in any practical sense.

The problem is that you have a ton of tiny inputs (my guess is many very small mining rewards) which makes your transaction size larger than is worth executing. Think of it this way:
You pay to move coins by weight (transaction size).
So, moving a penny and quarter cost roughly the same because they weigh roughly the same.
However, moving 25 pennies costs 25 times as much as moving one quarter.
You should have paid attention when Exodus (and every lite wallet provider!) warned you their wallets weren't suitable for mining rewards and/or micro payments on the Bitcoin network. This is a long, well understood issue with Bitcoin.

Miners choose based on what they happen to prefer. Many have deals with exchanges to prioritize their transactions (for, e.g. a separate monthly fee).
ViaBTC let’s their customers (and quick anons) to jump to the front of the line: 
Your transaction only gets accelerated if the miner that gives you preferential treatment happens to win the block.

You will not earn back your initial investment  using a cloud mining service. Many are outright scams, the rest are folks content to offer a product that technically does what they say (it mines) but never delivers what you expect (more BTC than you put in). Buy your coin and hold it. Buy another down the road and hold both. Etc.

The 1Broker folks wish their datacenter would warn them before going offline.
And the datacenter wishes that their Internet provider would warn them before their connection goes down.
And the Internet provider wishes that their power company would warn them before a power loss.
And the power company wishes that trees would warn them before falling on the power lines.
In other words, usually when a site goes offline unexpectedly, the root cause is far enough away from the site that the site admins had no warning either, and that is likely true a couple of levels of infrastructure up the stack.
These days, your best bet is probably following your favorite services on Twitter (etc.) because that is where they usually post statuses in situations like this.

Sorry, that's what happened. Your comment said you knew the MEANING. I'm curious what you believe this event means, any beyond caveat emptor?

Personally, I would proactively offer to return the coins to them, otherwise you might have just publicly admitted to (intentionally or not) committing interstate chargeback fraud.
Making the offer is your get out of jail free card if either Coinbase or your credit card company decide they've been harmed by your keeping both the refund and the product that supposedly wasn't delivered. They get up to seven years to figure this out and press charges... 
But if you offer and they don't respond in a reasonable timeframe (at least 60 days, suggest asking a local lawyer...) then you've made a good faith effort to return their property (i.e. committed no crime) and their recourse for recovering the tokens from future you (when they might be worth a LOT more) is severely limited.
You might also want to delete your comment.

Did you use the same twelve words in both wallets? If so, they are the same wallet.
