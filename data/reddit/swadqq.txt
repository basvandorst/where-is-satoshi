Thanks very much for your support and help, I'll be taking all this into account and updating the bot tomorrow
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:41:04
This is a really cool idea
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:14:02
Good response. Would tip if I had anything in my changetip account
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:58:31
Of course! That makes perfect sense, my bad
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:13:17
665: Holy shit
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:48:44
I would code this for a bounty. Pretty cool idea
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:54:35
What do you mean? It is for IRC
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:48:09
Not sure if this is a troll or a misguided post about timezones 
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:39:22
Only skimmed through the article, but the photos look like slave labour. They're all dressed the same sat around computers, this is exactly what Chinese gold farms look like. I really hope this organisation isn't taking advantage of them under the masquerade of helping them
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:01:54
Drugs and gambling. For now
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:00:26
Multi-cryptocurrency wallet is really interesting. I imagine there are some open source projects that have that in the works already.
I don't think I'm the right person to run an exchange properly
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:40:13
Here you go:

This is pretty much the only thing that could get them back. If a weakness is exposed in sha-256 (and latterly sha-512), there will be a hard fork to some new algorithm (quantum hashing?). Any bitcoins that aren't converted/upgraded before the weakness becomes a problem will be fair game
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:53:15
Besides, you know, being based on a meme that everybody wanted to jump on the bandwagon of
But yes, I do agree that this is in part why doge was successful. Using coins as whole units rather than fractions seems more tangible 
@_date: 2014-06-07 09:36:29
I can get him running on any network you like, if you have a large enough channel to get the not started with
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:49:57
I'm starting to get frustrated with articles like this. We all saw this on this sub *yesterday*. We know where the source was, there is no new information here. Stop promoting your website -.-
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:57:19
CAPITAL LETTERS
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:13:36
I see, thank you. I also noticed that BitGo are planning to incorporate this too
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:32:42
I was attempting to buy BTC two days ago, but couldn't because I'd forgotten some of my details for online banking. I'll be back online on Tuesday, I hope I'm in time for the trip to the moon
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:47:26
Looks like a ponzi to me
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:19:38
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:00:31
Yes, those coins would be lost forever (or at least until great mathematical advancements are made)
By the time bitcoin is a currency, there will be procedures in place to pass on your BTC in your will when you pass away. You can already do this with a paper wallet. As BTC grows more prominent, more people will set up contingency plans. The problem will solve itself.
The other great thing about BTC is that it is much more sub-dividable than fiat. If necessary, we can go right down to the satoshi.

They aren't his children, they're someone else's. He discovers babies on reddit, and gives the parents an amount of bitcoins to save until the babies are 18. He's not asking for donations for himself, but for other children

I'm sure a lot of people *will* want the OTC WOT, just a matter of having someone step up to integrate it
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:29:32
Part of me doesn't want to upvote this in case someone malicious catches wind of this. But then again, people need to know about this. Sigh. I hope Coin.MX get their act together
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:12:16
This would be very simple to make, but I don't personally see the demand.
Well, I see the demand for answerers, but not for people asking questions
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:59:41
Very scientific.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:41:07
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:51:41
Could somebody explain why this was downvoted? It seems like a good resource for anybody interested in implementing this sort of system. I might be missing something though, please enlighten me
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:47:54
I don't believe you
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:35:12
Yeah, my bad! It's live in  right now
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:08:34
I wonder if they had a problem with this in the past? :o
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:50:19
My CV isn't especially impressive. If there is a job that you have in mind for me, you are welcome to PM me, however, I don't want to post a CV here as I am worried that a lack of experience might censor the more bold (and perhaps important) ideas
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:33:41
Are you involved? If so, could you highlight some areas that currently need to be addressed (there are a large number of issues on github already)?
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:43:57
Indeed - It is my understanding that Armory is offline though, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:00:04
I'm sorry :( [I get it](
I thought the joke was good at least
@_date: 2014-06-07 09:37:28
I do t plan on being intrusive with the bot, it's invite only and it doesn't spam. It's up to channel owners to want to use it
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:48:01
That's very honourable actually, good for you!
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:35:19
I agree that she shouldn't get her hands on it. However, maybe the actual parents should hodl on to it? Just as a formality, seems more like a gift then
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:13:09
Is English your first language? I would expect a more professional introductory pitch, that's all.
It's ok if it's not, of course, it just seems like a red flag to me
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:51:28
Wait, you mean PayPal is currently being used for transactions in lots of places? I'd never have known!
Seriously, the BTC/PP news is not an excuse to make a post about everywhere PP is deployed
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:11:31
Any time, see you on there :)

Simon isn't arguing that 20MB is real or clean - he's saying exactly what you're saying
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:26:55
Did you know his real name was Fifi Millicent?

Try "Colloquy" or "Textual" - they'll allow you to connect to IRC servers
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:22:24
I feel like a new subreddit could practically do this. However, your idea does seem to be generating some support. I'd love for some others to weigh in on this if they would
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:35:56
And other comments like it.
Don't worry, I felt [exactly the same as you the first time I saw one of his posts](

I don't think we can solve the data transfer problem given that nothing can travel 5 light minutes in less than 5 minutes. There are other solutions though, like others have mentioned, like longer block confirmation times
