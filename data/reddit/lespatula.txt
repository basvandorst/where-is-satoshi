Yeah. There's a video in this subreddit of a guy buying 10 bitcoins 7 years ago for a few bucks. If I only could send myself a message back in time.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:18:50
I made a similar mistake. But hey, it won't matter anymore once bitcoin is at 100k.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:36:20
Understood. Will buy more drugs. For bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:35:27
I accumulated enough, time to moon.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:07:24
At the current value I have about 14k in bitcoin.

But how do you get money in and out of it once it's illegal? Sure, you could buy it in person, but the other guy could be an undercover cop.

I'm close to two so probably two.

I agree. E.g. coinbase is fully insured, opearates as a bank in the usa and  stores 98% of coins in cold storage.

Meanwhile, my swiss bank (swissquote) allows me to buy cryptos directly for my portfolio.

So now we only had a way to buy bitcoins (by credit card). 
I used to use coin.mx, but they implemented a new verification process which makes it impossible to buy bitcoins.

All the presentations will soon be available, also the talks will be uploaded on youtube. However, I think you will be disappointed. None of the talks was specifically how to diversify the portfolio with crypto. More about the technology in general. And in German, and some in Swiss-German.

He had 10 other slides with Dow Jones, Gold, Oil etc... The point was to show volatility, and the other didn't look better.

This bank above sells bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:03:11
Yes, this bank has several cryptos in their portfolio which you can buy and transfer in and out to another wallet if you want.

Switzerland, Swissquote, which also offers crypto assets.

I will post the link once it's out, probably you find something you can use.

See you on the moon.

Everybody just buy and hodl!

@_date: 2019-06-30 14:43:29
How are those transactions verified?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:30:13
I have 0.5 at my bank and 0.73 at coinbase (Yeah, I should move it out, yada, yada).
@_date: 2019-06-13 08:29:46
Not like crazy hazy lity boy. So sad.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:57:13
You had to put it in the reader? Doesn't it have NFC like every other card so you could just tab it? Or is this not a thing in the US?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:52:11
When I'm drunk I sometimes buy everyone in a sub gold. And buy stupid stuff for myself. One time I watched "The Mummy" drunk and I ordered books about Egyptology.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:23:40
Yes, if the past is any indicator.
@_date: 2012-12-16 13:20:29
I won't accept it until you add Carl Sagan.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:01:37
It will be rejected at 11'000.-
