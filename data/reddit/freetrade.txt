I don't have a particular opinion on the block size debate. However, I do think it is a mistake to assume good faith from all participants. Altcoins in particular will benefit from Bitcoin having smaller blocks for two reasons.
The first reason is smaller blocks means fewer transactions, means higher transaction fees, means more transactions for altcoins. The second reason is that if it impossible to change Bitcoin in any meaningful way, then new ideas can only be implemented in altcoins.
So if I were holding a large position in an altcoin, self-interest might incline me to argue for smaller blocks, and not necessarily for the good of Bitcoin. So evaluate not just the arguments, but where they are coming from too. Conflicts of interest abound.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:37:55
Yep. I'd say that is exactly what he wants.
Litecoin is essentially a bet that Bitcoin won't scale.
If Bitcoin fails to scale, Litecoin use rockets. I'm assuming CL has a big chunk of LTC, and even if not, I'm sure he'd like to see his baby grow. Not judging, just seems like the obvious rationale. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:26:49
It's critical to know this when evaluating arguments from CL. If I owned a lot of LTC, I'd wouldn't want BTC to scale, because if BTC doesn't scale, overflow transactions take place on alts and LTC price goes way up.
@_date: 2015-12-04 03:27:04
Thanks Charlie. However, if I owned $50 worth of LTC and $100 worth of BTC, I'd still want to see scaling on BTC fail. That's because my BTC would drop 50%, but my LTC would rise 500%. 
Again, not judging, that's just the rationale as I see it. It's a conflict of interest if you have large holdings of LTC, whether they are smaller than your BTC holdings or not. I can't view you as unbiased in the block size debate.

Should be possible to have multiple private keys for a single address - using one for collecting interest, and one for signing transactions. The collecting interest one has to be hot, but if it is compromised, no big deal - just transfer coins to new address.

They're looking to get to 50%+ at which point most of the other miners will fall in line and 75% will happen pretty quick.
The same wouldn't happen with SegWit though - as you say, the Core side isn't as passionate and need 95% which simply isn't going to happen without compromise.

Seems like the Chinese exchange prices are still being used to calculate the average price of BTC . . . so places like CMC, CBI are off by about $11 from the real price. (Price atm is 1058, but CMC calling it 1047)
The Chinese exchanges are trading IOUs for BTC at this point, and IOUBTC shouldn't be used to calculate the average price of BTC. Interesting that the ETF news might come out while the Chinese exchanges are still locked down . . . I'd be mightily miffed about that if I had BTC in a Chinese exchange.

They should really raise the price of tickets sky high.
Leave 40,000 or so people waiting on the platform, and encourage them to pay an additional fee for a better chance of getting on the next train.
Also, it might be a good idea to make the train shorter, ensuring it is easier to operate for the train company.
Or i guess they could add a luggage compartment to the top of the train, if some people were persuaded to use it, you might fit more people inside the train. That would be a technically elegant solution.
One thing that absolutely should not be done is to extend the length of the train or add more carriages. That's too risky.

@_date: 2017-02-03 08:41:50
I'm confused by your response, and I'm guessing we're talking about different ideas.
I'm talking about a making a minimum fee required for a transaction to be valid . . . so only transactions with the minimum fee would be included in blocks, and any blocks that included transactions without the minimum fee would be rejected. Fees would, of course, go to miners. 
Actually miners could collude to implement this already. My question . . . would having such an enforced minimum allay concerns of network spam?
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:34:31
Agreed. Nearly everyone agrees we need bigger blocks, or pretends to agree we need bigger blocks, so once we get more than 50% hashing power saying this too, I think the minority will fall in line and the hard fork won't be contentious. 
It's contentious now because argument can effect the outcome, but once it is inevitable (50%+), everyone will get behind it.

Adding a minimum transaction fee doesn't grant any additional trust to miners. I accept the attack you describe would still be possible - someone could rent hash rate and fill the blocks they mine with spam. That applies any time there is available space in the block.
Currently users are paying the surplus to ensure there is no space available - i guess if block size is to be increased, it needs to happen gradually.
Thanks anyway, you've changed my mind about the usefulness of minimum trx fees. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:24:02
Yes, there is posturing and bluffing on both sides.  At this point it looks like SegWit is dead in the water, and a BU hard fork is 50/50.

How about a 'pick a side' UASF - There is 75% support for scaling (Core+BU+8MB) - if that 75% were to orphan blocks that don't support any form of scaling, that 25% would need to either pick a side, or both sides, or continue with a minority chain.

Sub-cent fees sounds a bit optimistic, somewhere between 2 and 10 cents for a basic on-chain transaction should be possible though and maintain a high level of security. Assuming bigger blocks are adopted of course.
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:24:57
It's given me another idea though - setting a minimum trx fee, but destroying it - so if there was a 5cent minimum and the user paid a 10cent fee, the first 5cents would be destroyed and the remainder would go to the miner. That might ensure it would be costly to add spam, but the change might be too big to add Bitcoin at this point.
@_date: 2017-02-03 09:36:06
Ok, thanks for expanding on that.
However, at the moment (with larger blocks) a spam attack can be initiated by anyone with funds . . .  with a minimum transaction fee, it would require the complicity of a miner and would only effect that miners blocks - and since all the funds flow back to the miner, a miner could do the same attack already. The incentives don't really line up for the miner.
So while a minimum transaction fee won't enforce minimum transaction fees (for the reason you mention) - that's not why I suggest it - I think it would be helpful with reducing the possibility of a spam attack.
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:19:12
Thank you. This is a real 'aha insight' for me.
I don't see the BTC price ever being stable, so I don't imagine there will be a great demand for CC merchant accounts denominated in BTC. However, asserting it as a possibility does help clarify the difference between money and a payment mechanism. BTC has it's own built-in electronic payment mechanism, but that doesn't preclude other payment mechanisms.

Independent exchanges can be expected to listen to their customers, and they'll lose customers if they get it badly wrong.

Sad to say that Airbnb will be the last company to add Bitcoin support. They're very interested in your identity for a lot of reasons so won't support a currency that can be used anonymously. 
This sounds unbelievable, but they actually asked to view my google documents and blocked my account when I refused access. This was after I had already used my credit card, and stayed at a few places with good feedback. They really, really want to be sure of your identity . . . and I can understand that . . I wouldn't want to rent out my home to someone who might be using a fake identity and using bitcoin to remain anonymous.

A sidechain has a lot more friction to gain adoption.
With a side chain, people have to transfer funds to it first - if no-one has funds there, no-one accepts it and if no-one accepts it, no-one transfers funds there. it's a chicken-and-egg problem.
With a fork, everybody with Bitcoin automatically has funds in the forked chain, so the chicken-and-egg problem is solved.

The key idea is that BigBlockers should fork but merge mine with the original Bitcoin chain.
It splits Bitcoin into a settlement network(original 1MB), and a payment network (unlimited, BU). Miners can mine and protect both networks simultaneously.
BU miners can then support Segwit on the settlement network in return for Segwit miners agreeing to merge mine for the new payment network. Everybody gets what they want.
It can't be successfully obstructed by small-blockers or developers.
It requires, at a minimum, one large mining pool and major bitcoin processors (BitPay, Purse) to agree to accept the new network's tokens in addition to the old tokens.
Hodlers automatically get tokens in both networks and the prices of the two tokens float independently of each other.
Thanks to Olivier Janssens for this document, although I understand he was not ready for it to be made public when it was. It was withdrawn and disappeared rather hastily, but given Bitpay's recent support for bigger blocks, it is an idea whose time has come.

There might be a LukeCoin on August 1st - it'll have to be the hard fork with a POW to prevent on-chain scaling. It might see some minority interest. Keep your coins off-exchange on August 1st if you want a piece of it.
There will be a fork when Segwit2x activates from the 'Never Segwit' movement. This will likely require a PoW change too, but the anti-segwit folks haven't realised this yet. Again, keep your coins off-exchange if you want a piece of it.
There will be another fork when Segwit2X folks presses ahead with the 2X part - you can expect Blockstream and Church of Core Clerics to go full fire and brimstone on that. Again, keep your coins off-exchange.

I agree - an amicable supportive divorce would be preferable to all the crockery throwing. 
However, my sense is that Chinese miners are too cautious about the risks of taking decisive action like supporting a merge-mined fork, but too incautious about the risks of doing nothing.
Both sides need to think about how they can support each other in a divorce rather than thinking about how they can gain advantage inside a union. For example big-block miners could support segwit in return for segwit miners agreeing to merge mine a forked chain.

No, if you have 100BTC, after a fork, you have 100BTC and 100BTU. The values of the two float on the open market. It doesn't matter if the value of BTU is a lot lower than BTC, because it's use is for payments. Keep your BTC, spend your BTU. Or vice versa if you're so inclined.
