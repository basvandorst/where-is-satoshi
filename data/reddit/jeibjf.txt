Regardless of any terms of service legal loopholes that might exist, I believe that I have the right to display the data queried from any website in any way I want. Including blocking advertisements - something I hate with passion. 
Yes, I know Google would not be here if no ads were shown, etc. But I have donated to websites that I like, and think that this kind of voluntary support is the moral thing to do. They made money for expenses and possibly for profit without shoving annoying distracting advertisements down my throat. Bitcoin makes it easier to donate, too.

This didn't really answer my question. Double spend means that the original transaction did not end up in the blockchain, but the fraudulent one did. If both are sent from a single node simultaneously, there is a 50% chance of the double spend being successful. But what if the good one was sent out from many nodes at the same time, and the fraudulent one from only a single node. Wouldn't that decrease the chance of the fraudulent ending up in the blockchain?

Cool, thanks.

By paying my ISP I am supporting the internet infrastructure, and thus I participate in it. I request data from IP's that want to give it to me (no one is forced to give me anything). I allow access to my data (torrents), again, I don't have to do it but I have the option to - since I am paying for internet. I assume my ISP is using the money to keep up the connecting infrastructure.

Say a huge payment corporation like square decides to embrace bitcoin. Could it use its power/money to reduce the risk of double spending? For example, by immediately flooding the whole network with the original spend, so that the chance of it getting accepted by a miner is much larger than the fraudulent one?

Everyone pays their provider to give upload/download access to the internet. Including me. Including the sites I visit. If you don't want internet, don't pay and leave. It's very simple.

Wow! Thank you. I prefer to pirate even if it is easier to "purchase" music. But I have donated to musicians I like, and this is great news! Hopefully more content creators will release media under a CC license and start accepting Bitcoin.

EFF is one of the few organizations that have my absolute support - their agenda aligns fully with my beliefs. 
I've donated before and will donate again.
