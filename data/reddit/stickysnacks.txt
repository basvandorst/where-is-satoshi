Please outline where I presented anything as 'fact'. Very curious about this.

sorry, I read too fast. I thought he said he had $2500 to spend. Anyone should follow the rule of not investing what you can't afford to lose.

Go all in and hodl. 20 years from now you'll thank yourself
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:43:44
I'm sorry, I thought this was an "in your opinion" question.
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:46:29
I'm honestly interested, how do you instantly purchase BTC with a bank account at only 1%, without using an exchange? I look around the Mycelium market and everyone there was crazy inflated.

Am I the only one here who remembers the dip last year around this time? By years end we'll be reaching ATH numbers ( please?)
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:57:40
What use is mining equipment after all bitcoins have been mined? Serious question as my understanding is there's a finite number of bitcoins.

How is it a refund when it's the money you should have been getting originally, but gave it to the government? I think return is more appropriate

When I signed up for coinbase they wanted a scan of my license and ssn. Is this not the case anymore? I've yet to find an exchange that allows withdrawal to USD where you don't have to give your SSN for tax purposes
@_date: 2016-06-09 16:31:30
you're right, I never did the math and only recently linked debit card to coin base. It's about 3.97%, still a bit higher than 1% from an account. Can't figure out why I'm limited to $60 for a transaction though.
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:57:07
I only get a $60 max with coinbase. Am I doing something wrong? Not to mention it's like 10% fee for instant
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:57:05
I had no idea there were so many different kinds of cryptocurrencies out there
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:21:50
and it just dropped to $650
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:49:27
Don't worry, I'll put a stop to this by buying more BTC. Seems like price ALWAYS drops significantly after I buy more.
EDIT:  See! It worked! I bought more bitcoin at 1140 and it dropped to 900. FML
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:22:47
Used to have $60 debit card limit, now they introduce this and my limit changed to $40. How does that work?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:36:37
usually the place you're paying will pay the fees, but in this case, the DMV is passing on the fees to the customer because fuck them, I think?
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:00:32
You can't use a credit card to purchase more than $50 USD on coinbase without already having been a user for a couple months and having purchased over $1200. They have weird limits, and even with the raised limits, you can't buy 3BTC with a credit card. That's waaay above what they allow
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:48:41
This is the reason I used Coinbase over local bitcoin in my area. Most mark-ups on people selling were closer to the 5-7% range, and anyone who was selling reasonably close to market value has really terrible reviews
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:55:33
Many exchanges give you the equivalent value of the new forked coin for your BTC holdings. So if you have 3BTC on Coinbase, after the fork you will have 3BTC and 3BTC2x

If Bitcoin were to become a true viable currency, people wouldn't be paying a bill in dollars. It would be 280mBTC and a month later still 280mBTC
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:20:57
I really think it's going to rise until Nov 16th, everybody pumping their coins into BTC so they can get free money when it splits, we just saw this same behavior back in August
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:40:02
Use a real exchange with a limit order and it's even better. An alert is no good if it goes off when you're sleeping
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:14:42
To a certain point, I would guess it would be. But considering in the last 3 months, there have been at least 2 times when the market started going crazy and Coinbase customers were unable to buy or sell their currencies, and all accounts were locked. I've been a Coinbase customer for a little over a year now, and I still transfer my coins to a separate wallet off the exchange
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:44:17
It's not just coinbase. GDX and Kraken are down as well
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:44:57
Sorry to say this dude but you deserved this. If you don't control your private key, you don't control your coins. A tough lesson to learn for sure but with hardware wallets at such a low cost there's no reason not to use them. GL with future transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:24:12
well.. whenever they were 20cents. 2009 then!
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:57:28
Get a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S and send the coins from coinbase to the address. Software wallets are only as secure as your computer (hint: not very secure at all)
Nobody can hack or delete a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:59:45
Same here... My brother told me about Bitcoin in like.. 2007 when they were about 20 cents each. I should have listened, but it was so sketch to buy them before! Oy

He continues to buy a little every week, just as he has over the years. He sends me links to sites like gyft.com and purse.io so I assume he's spending some. Definitely made himself set with some great initial investments.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:07:39
What is it?
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:03:03
I can't tell if you mean this as a good thing or a bad thing
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:31:49
It's probably true. I did end up buying $50 worth when it was around $110/btc and never sold. Ended up exchanging it over to ETH through Coinbase when they first brought it one board and am damn glad I did. Holy returns batman.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:03:59
He has so many he never told me how many he owns. Which is smart. Don't flaunt your wealth. He was definitely ahead of the curve, and was able to mine using his desktop when you'd be getting a coin a week. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:25:11
Holy balls that's tasty as fuck!
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:07:17
yeah, I did pretty well. Scooped up some other ETH while they were in the $14 range before the crash to $6, why didn't we all buy more then, eh?
