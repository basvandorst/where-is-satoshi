but offers no advantage over keeping it in USD. I understand your point but I'm simply trying to point out that tether is technically not an investment. Whether it's a good or bad investment wasn't really what I was trying to debate

Yeah that too, I don't really like mentioning coin A in coin B's sub largely out of respect.  
Anyway so the main thing that attracted me to *CoinNameHere* was their goal of creating a decentralised VPN / an open marketplace for people to sell and rent bandwidth for *CoinNameHere* while taking full advantage of privacy features like ring-CT.  
I figure the need/desire for privacy isn't going to be going away any time soon and the VPN market is constantly growing (but also often thwarted by services blocking the IP's of "known" VPN hosts)

Privacy is one reason, some also have other advantages/uses (I'd provide an example but I suspect it would just sound like blatant shilling)
