Just do it, you are not going to convince people who have been opposing to this for years without proposing an alternative. When in doubt, just do what we know Satoshi had in mind. If people like the MPEX crowd or known altcoiners want to boycott this and stay in their own little fork, so be it. You can't please everyone, just like the crippled 1mb Bitcoin couldn't please everyone either.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:25:49
Well I don't think making the temporary 1mb limit a forever 1mb limit is a good idea. If you think it is, you should try to convince the community. In the meantime, we'll just stick to the original *design* (ie. no limit).

I'm seeing a phenomenon where a lot of people who invested in Bitcoin suddenly believe they can guess every other successful technology, and so they invest in shitcoins, call themselves visionaries, and attack bitcoiners for being "closed minded". Eg: Litecoin because different hashing algorithm (why? lol), Feathercoin because integrated marketplace (meh), Dogecoin because community (really?), Ethereum because turing-complete (turing incompleteness is a feature in Bitcoin, but complete sounds better, right?), and so on.... My take on this: Prediction markets are cool and make sense. Ethereum doesn't. And even if it did, it doesn't even fucking exist. It's like all those crazy kickstarters that hype everyone with a good marketing video, like the solar panels in every road bullshit.

Do you really think you will be able to pump Monero by trashing Bitcoin and mocking anyone who disagrees with the changes you want to make to Bitcoin's original design? Like I said, even if you think 32mb was part of his design, why are you opposing raising the current 1mb limit? You make no sense, unless we take into account how invested you are into altcoins.

@_date: 2015-05-28 11:20:16
I'm familiar with it, you should do yourself a favor and stop believing you are the only one on Earth who understands Bitcoin. And by the way, the 32mb was not an explicit limit, but a limitation. There's nothing to make us think Satoshi wanted a 32mb hard limit. And even if there was, then that's where the limit should be by default. Not 1mb, not 20mb. 32mb.

@_date: 2015-05-27 23:37:22

Bitcoin is not a company, so it can't go "bankrupt". If it depended on a stupid auto-proclaimed foundation nobody would have invested in it and the price would be $0. But in any case, when someone asked what would happen if they stopped paying Gavin, he replied "You are not going to get rid of me so easily ;)", meaning he would continue working on it, the same way he did on the beginning.

You are too easily convinced by a couple of buzzwords written by their non-technical executives and marketing department.

@_date: 2015-04-11 02:08:30
Every 10 minutes on average, a new block with the latest transactions is added to the blockchain. If your transaction made it into a block, that's 1 confirmation. If another block is added later on that same chain, that's 2 confirmations. The deeper it gets buried into the blockchain, the more likely it is to be permanent.
Typically, for small payments you don't need any confirmations, because double-spends are not as easy to make as many claim, and certainly not common at all.
6 confirmations (about an hour in average) are considered practically irreversible, so that's what you would use for huge payments (credit cards take months to reach this level of irreversibility). Anything in between is up to the parties involved.
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:07:15
You got it backwards.

Coinbase is like a bank, while Trezor is like a nuclear bunker in your home. When you need your coins, Coinbase can simply say "no" (this is the sort of thing Bitcoin was created to avoid). With Trezor or a desktop wallet or a paper wallet you are in power.
But Coinbase also offers multi-signature, and if done right it might be safe. But for multi-signature I would rather use Coinkite instead.

Bitcoin has never been hacked.
The problem with individual computers' security is that generally they have never had anything valuable for the hackers in them. Bitcoin changed that, because hackers now have more incentives to hack them. This will be a push for more secure computers.

It is not self-maintaining unless it's open. What incentive would there be to spawn a mining industry if the coin has no value?

The purpose of HD wallets is precisely avoiding retarded schemes like yours, where you have to continually regenerate the backup, which is error-prone and has made people lose coins in the past. HD wallets are backup once, be safe forever.

Just because big companies are doing it, it doesn't mean it will work. In fact, so far it looks like the people in charge of those projects don't understand the "blockchain technology" at all.
