Implying any entity could become the only buyer. Even if they were offering 100 000 dollars per coin, people would not sell all. If they FUDded the price down, then especially, people would not sell all (the wise and FUD-resistant would buy rather than selling).

You don't get it.

You keep on going on and on but you don't speak for me.
You talk about a situation where if you input the wrong destination address, it is sent to that address, so people will get into the habit of checking very carefully. And if you put in the right address, it's sent there.
Did you know: that, that right there, is the exact specific thing I want. I would fight in a war for years to achieve that specific aim, that specific scenario. It's fucked up that it ever could be any other way, get it away from me.

Yes, I know. The extreme intrusive requirements to get a loan or mortgage, and also to a lesser extent the fact of being in such a large debt, are already intolerable whatever happens, so mortgages and bank loans may as well not exist for me, or many other people.
In the case of mortgages and bank loans, the intrusive requirements are arguably part of the product, so the bank can be sure to get their value back by physical force. They are completely unnecessary for the storage of money, as illustrated by Bitcoin. But they bleed into and contaminate everything else.
People everywhere being trained to accept extreme personal intrusion and addicted to debt is not a good thing. It's extremely unpleasant. It's also much harsher on the environment when people buy endless products they don't need and can't afford, only to throw them away.
A modified form of lending, automatically operated without force or any intrusion, happens with a smart contract and cryptocurrency as collateral, although I haven't used that part of the smart contract, but I've used the token.
