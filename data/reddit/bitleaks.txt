It means that we were unable to reach the site for some reason. All those white spots at the moment seem to be Cloudflare errors.

    Hey everyone,
    
    I am the creator of the new website  I'm going to be uploading and archiving Bitcoin related documents here especially the ones that are vulnerable to censorship. Wordpress taking down the Willy Report for TOS violations has inspired me to make this website. Hopefully it's some use for some people.
    
    If you would like to submit a leak/document/anything there is a PGP key and a contact email available on the page. Regarding original content, if you have a report you wrote feel free to send it in and we may or may not post it depending on the quality.
    
    The goal of this project is to create an archive of all important Bitcoin related documents including subpoenas, statements, court orders and anything else. We are also creating a safe place where high profile Bitcoin figures can go to leak documents they feel need to be public for the greater good of the community without getting themselves involved.
    
    In the next couple of days I will be doing some work on the page, I just wanted to put out this PDF for anyone who wanted it.

Weird, thought this would be information would be interested in! Feel free to downvote and if no one is interested it won't reach the front page anyway.

Looks very promising. Obviously a mistake, but an extremely revealing one. I expect the DRK price to react to this very shortly.
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:41:31
Lots of Bitfinex news tonight ;).
Can anyone else independently confirm this bug exists?
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:04:01
I wouldn't say it is anymore when they are clearly listing DRK/BTC on their website, lol. It's a little past that point.
@_date: 2014-05-30 05:20:56
They may add DRK.
@_date: 2014-05-30 05:35:21
See my posting history. Speculation with evidence.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:30:52
I can tell by the upvote/downvote spread that you are correct. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:49:47
Except for the fact that it is.
Go look buddy.
Please do some research before replying to me ignorantly.

Seems like they have mitigated the attack.

PSA: GHash seems to be losing hashrate and is now under DDoS attack 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:34:41
Unfortunately I saw it while I was writing the script for this site, but I saw their reported hashrate as low as 29.xxPH/s today which is a huge difference from 40PH/s.
Not sure how I can prove it, but it happened. Hopefully this script will catch it again.

Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad you think this is a good idea.
In my opinion even if the Willy Report is not fully factual there is still a lot of important and useful research and information in the report that may be useful later on. Regardless, it made for a very interesting theory and is probably one of the better constructed Mt.Gox theories out there.
