this is not new, its been here a while. The cops watch it so that is hella weird. Not even a joke. Look at some busts they've sat there and watched people use the ATM. 
Moreover, the ATM is finnicky. I do not reccomend.

Yeah I know the article is not a joke but very irresponsible. The reason I post it is because I just had lunch w my boss, who said at the airport a couple months back he read an article on btc in esquire, so I fired up the google and typed 'bitcoin esquire' and this was the article that popped up..what an embarassment indeed.

For what its worth maybe only the first time you transact with coinbase do you wonder about getting scammed. I buy about .1 bitcoin per day and so I always have a back log of bitcoins going through. It is fun!

@_date: 2014-06-19 14:21:25
You make an "accusation" but the OP wrote a very well thought out post. It makes sense. You're accusation is fine but is not backed up with a lot of thought except skepticism towards the OPs invested interest. 
Care to elaborate ?

DHS was seeking a warrant for Karapeles e-mails already in connection with the SR investigation.

Agreed, it is DHS saying that Karpeles kept coming up in their investigation.

I thought there was a paper written by someone Japanese at the NSA which talked about Bitcoin. Back in like 92. 
Edit: 
Seems obvious to me that would be Satoshi? Does it even matter? 
Edit: here is references that he cites in the paper. There is a lot more. I find it impossible that he doesn't at least have a working relationship w someone who helped create btc. 
This is where that paper came from: 
Thinking about it now it would seem perhaps Bitcoin was developed as a method of transporting $$ quickly and mostly anonymously. The research and writing was on the wall for 20 years. Hmmm. 
Edit 2: I'm like 200 percent sure him and others developed Bitcoin. He left America a while ago. He's been in Japan since 2001. It's also interesting that Mark is in Japan. I wonder if he knows Dr. Okamoto who contributed greatly. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 07:38:35
Yep. You can convert in small amounts etc or in other ways. Not that this is a way to necessarily get around things but just ideas. 
For example you could buy a gift card. Say, whole foods gift cards in the amount of 100 every couple days. Now you don't ever have to worry about feeding your family again. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:24:11
Tad bit aggressive. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:31:01
Who reports gift cards as income though?
