Even fiat doesn't have to be done by a country, look at things like company scrip or for a modern example Canadian Tire bucks.

The site is exceptionally clean, and does look like it is up-to-date with current web design standards, which does breed confidence compared to some of the 1990's sites I've seen for LR currency exchangers.  However, I find the front page to be lacking enough text about the services.  Minimalist design ethics are great for many things, but financial services require a certain ethos that goes beyond 1 sentence blurbs for a particular aspect of the service.  I would consider deviating from the center justified main page, and splitting it up to include at least one side bar for greater detail of information, testimonials, security certification, etc.
The actual interface now that I've received my account is also rather skimpy on information.  Granted for your service there isn't too much to say when viewing your transactions page, however, as is, it looks too sparse for a financial service.  Remember, bitcoins have economic value, and for some clients they could be dealing with sizable amounts of assets (relative to their income), this means you are in the trust industry above anything else (especially with the 'newness' of bitcoins and volatile market).
Instill trust and you'll be golden.

I don't think you understand how slow cpu mining is; we are talking about a year to get a bitcoin from a mining pool.

Just remember the universal law, past performance is not a predictor of future results.

There are compelling arguments for the quality of life of pre-agriculture, hunter-gather societies.  [Here is one of Jared Diamond's short essays as an example.](

LIBERALISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which attempts to correct the injustices of capitalism by adding new laws to the existing laws. Each time conservatives pass a law creating privilege, liberals pass another law modifying privilege, leading conservatives to pass a more subtle law recreating privilege, etc., until "everything not forbidden is compulsory" and "everything not compulsory is forbidden."
Edit: Works better with the accompanying definitions:
CONSERVATISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which claims allegiance to the Free Market while actually supporting usury, landlordism, tariff, and sometimes taxation.
CAPITALISM: That organization of society, incorporating elements of tax, usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while pretending to exemplify it.
