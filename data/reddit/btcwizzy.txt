I am with you to a certain extent. Sold 95% of my BTC when it was around $1200. Never since been able to recover the stash to even close to what it was. I buy some every paycheck now.

You can have multiple wallets on a single device, secured via different PIN Codes and additional passphrase. Keep small amounts under the normal wallet, and the bigger amounts secured further.

It's enterprising on their part being that electricity is free. I would apply for a newegg credit card and finance mining gear on 0% interest for 6-months or a year. Make payments each month to ensure I don't pay interest on the credit and mine away.
Even better in colder parts of the world. Use it as a heat source, or crack the window if it's too warm.

Every paycheck GDAX gets a $200 deposit from me. The day it clears is the day I buy. So far this strategy has worked best.
But I was thinking about depositing the cash and just letting it sit until an event like today.

One of my relatives I told about bitcoin a few years ago called me to gloat. "bet you wish you didn't buy that shit now!" 
I mined some up when it was $300, sold some at $1100. started picking up small amounts every pay cycle after college. Sold some at $10K and paid of student loans. Continued buying small amounts every paycheck. Original investment is all clear now, just Hodling pure profits. 
Followed up with,"With that in mind, I bet you DID buy some when we spoke about it."

As someone already mentioned there really isn't a difference in security. GDAX and Coinbase are the same entity. Buying through GDAX is cheaper in terms of fees though. And sending bitcoin externally from GDAX to a different wallet is cheaper as well, they wave the fee I believe.

LOLing at six week low. Stock charts usually have it listed right on there the 52-week lows and highs. In our case that would be a 52 week low of $835 and a high of $19,900.

Back in 2017 when things were going wild, I had a woman I used to work with a few years prior hitting me up about bitcoin mining opportunities. First off when I worked with her she could barely open a spread sheet or power on the "internet" to check her email. I did a 2 minute google search and found out it was an MLM. She sells "mining time" under her profile and she would get a bigger percentage of bitcoin that is mined by the company, and then downstream people would have to do the same. I actually felt bad enough that I met her for coffee and spent like an hour trying to explain why it was all a scam but she insisted she was making money. She may have been since the price was going through the roof at the time.  She invited me to some live video conference via Facebook where I proceeded to counter the speakers points on how mining works. That bitcoin doesn't earn interest, that they cannot mine "infinite" amounts of bitcoin, and generally all sorts of bullshit they were talking about. I got kicked out for spreading false information pretty quickly.
When the price goes up, the scammers resurface. Be careful, hold your keys, verify everything yourself.

Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but the IRS expects you to report capital gains as First in First out (FIFO) 
Say you bought 0.1 bitcoin at $700, 0.4 at $1100, and then 3.0 at $4000. Then Sold 1.0 of your 3.5 BTC at $20,000. I believe your cost basis for that one bitcoin would be recorded as $3800 ($700 + $1100 + ($4000/0.5)) and your capital gains would be $16,200 
 which you owe taxes on. Going to be really difficult to report if you have a shit ton of transactions.

Similar story. I was told to shut up by my mom on Thanksgiving in 2013. Dad and I were talking about bitcoin in the kitchen. As I explained it to him, my grandpa overheard us, but was too confused by the words I was using, and it upset him to the point of my mom stepping in. I would have happily attempted to dumb my conversation down for my non-technical grandfather but instead remained silent.
I didn't speak to anyone from my family for the rest of that day. If they don't want to take interests at all in my interests than why should I take any interest in football, or the parade, or whatever other non-sense they were carrying on about that day.
Now they are all asking me about bitcoin and digital currencies on a weekly basis. My dad wants to get into a bit to diversify his retirement money a bit more.

It is also worth noting that he used his admin rights on Blockchain.info to attack a customer from a separate company he owned, bitcoinstore.com. He publicly revealed someone's personal information, online, using admin rights from a separate company, over a $50 dispute, that his company was at fault for over sending too much bitcoin in the first place. 
I remember when that went down. It backfired so horrendously that he had to lock the thread from further comments. Abuse of power over $50. Fuck that guy.

Definitely agree that would be ideal as a temporary solution as well. But with traveling, they might not have access to an offline computer WITH a printer that they can trust completely.

Right. I wasn't suggesting that. Also I should have added never to store your private key mnemonic online or where strangers have access to it, and protect it, don't lose it.
This post doesn't mention if it's a significant amount. Which varies from person to person. It also suggests they are looking for the safest way to store them NOW, until they later have access to getting a hardware wallet. As long as they have their private key, which many smart phone wallets support, they can safely store some bitcoin in their pocket for a short period. This is safer than keeping them in Coinbase or any other exchange that you have no control of your keys.

Difficulty adjustment is coming in a day and a half. Since BCash launch is has been pumping up in price every two weeks almost like clock work.

When I get worried about Roger's antics I take a look at [ and remind myself they have less than 7% of the hashing power that Bitcoin does. Most of Bitcoin's progress is better than BCH over. Their block height is higher currently but we are catching back up.
The big thing they have against Bitcoin is fees, currently. If that doesn't get solved in 2018 there could be a possibility of a flipping as they say.

I have an ex coworker from like 6 years back that has been hitting me up about bitcoin because I mentioned it in passing back then. She wants me to join her "Be your own boss" thing involving bitcoin mining because she gets a 2% bump in hashing power for everyone who signs on as her affiliate. 
It's called Omnia Tech. They buy mining contracts from Genesis Mining on your behalf but you don't get the entire hash rate unless people sign up under you. Such garbage. I joined her Facebook group and several live video streams, and ended up getting banned for asking too many questions. :P

Their support is definitely lacking. And they don't make it easy to retrieve any forked coins. You pretty much would have to move everything off that wallet, use the private key mnemonic from green address to get your BCH on another wallet. Then start up a new wallet on green address with a different private key and send your bitcoin back there. A bit of work to recovery those coins in a secure manor.
Bitcoin Gold from a segwit address on green address is seemingly impossible to recover at the moment. different BIP protocols as far as I can remember from reading.

Also I should add that he was working for blockchain.info, but it was his other company bitcoinstore that screwed up and over paid. He used his power at blockchain.info to dox the guy over what his OTHER company screwed up. Pretty unethical use of admin privileges, a conflict of interest, and overall douche thing to do. 
If this wasn't crypto, and a credit card for instance, it would have been highly illegal for him to that in PCI compliance terms. Of course with credit cards, he would have been able to file a claim and get his $50 back.

"I'd like to take exception to your first comment, that bitcoin core developers are some of the best in the world. That is ABSOLUTELY really not true, they took bitcoin, which used to have fast, reliable transactions, on-chain. And they turned it into this incredibly congested network... And in that time bitcoin went from 100% market share to less than 50%... by that standard i think they are one of the worst development teams in the cryptocoin ecosystems." - RV
That is a bold statement that it's core developers fault bitcoin is popular and overloaded with fees currently. And also that it's their fault that other coins were able to take some market share.

I agree actually. Open source software should fork for proof of concept. Ultimately the better code would be merged back into the original project. There are plans to increase the block size slowly over time, perhaps we should have increased to 2MB after all so that Bcash side wouldn't be using that as their main argument right now.

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:55:31
You should do a ton more research. 
BCH is backed by RV and some other shady characters and is currently highly centralized. They forked and created Bitcoin Cash which increased the block size from 1MB to 8MB which currently allows for faster and cheaper transactions on-chain. 
Bitcoin's current scaling solutions are to keep blocks 1MB and scale off-chain with Lighting Network or similar. 
Forks are not a bad thing with open source software, but malicious characters with big marketing budgets can be. [

It's been a while since I looked at the bitcoin.com wallet. But I suspect they are defaulting to high priority fees on that wallet.
I sent a decent sized transaction from Green Address to Coinbase recently and paid the equivalent of about $0.80 for it, economy fees in Green Address. Yes that seems high when you compare it to BCash being about a penny. But it got it's 6 confirmations in just under an hour. First confirmation was within 5 minutes. Not $100 for it to maybe confirm in 24 hours. That is FUD.

Block reward for finding a bitcoin block is cut in half. Started at 50 bitcoin approximately every 10 minutes when bitcoin started. Then down to 25, currently at 12.5, and this will be the third halving and it goes down to 6.25. Bitcoin gets more scarce and eventually caps out at 21,000,000 bitcoin that will ever exist.

Where are you getting $5K a month from? That would need to be earning 12% interest consistently to achieve that at $500,000. On top of that statement, OP said he took home about $357,000 after taxes so would need even more interest.  
If he put half the $357K into bitcoin in May of this year he is already up somewhere around 45% on that investment.

Bitcoin’s biggest flaw is lack of privacy. If you buy from an exchange that uses KYC, then you send to a private wallet, then to anywhere for anything for any reason. It can be traced back to you.

This is why I am still hopefully for lightning and layered solutions. Bigger blocks, mean bigger chains, means LESS people WILL WANT to run nodes. It's not necessarily that they "can't afford" to run a node as many suggest, it's that they won't want to. It's likely means they need a dedicated device with TB's of space to run a node.

This happened to my sister recently. Her husband passed away, but not unexpectedly. He had enough time and forethought to write me an email a few months before with his PIN codes, passphrases to his password manager, and a brief description of where his investments were spread out.
From there I was able to help my sister recover roughly 10 BTC and 200 Ethereum. She sold 80% of those around May / June of this year and is hodling the rest to see how things play out. Meanwhile she has savings to work with while we figure out the rest.
I have done similar on paper for now. Addressed to my sisters. What I want to do next is set something up that if I don't log into my email for 2-3 weeks straight to automatically fire off an email to them containing what they need. There are services that accomplish for you as well. [IfIDie.org](

I do agree here. I think we should change the message to focus and support the developers creating the solutions to high fees, slow speeds, and privacy. The other side won't have arguments against the use case of Bitcoin, or a leg to stand, on if those get solved. Name calling is not the way to go. With that said, the other side is calling Bitcoin, "Core" or "BCore" or "Bitcoin Core" and claiming that they are the true bitcoin. That also hurts and confuses the image. A marketing campaign funded by users might actually go a long way if that was something we could organize.

Not the best idea to use VPN to hide the fact you use TOR. It is not illegal (In the USA) to use TOR. In regards to VPN this is directly stated on the [TOR FAQ.](   
" **Do not use a VPN as an** [**anonymity solution**]( If you're looking for a trusted entry into the Tor network, or if you want to obscure the fact that you're using Tor, [setting up a private server as a bridge]( works quite well.
VPNs encrypt the traffic between the user and the VPN provider, and they can act as a proxy between a user and an online destination. However, VPNs have a single point of failure: the VPN provider. A technically proficient attacker or a number of employees could retrieve the full identity information associated with a VPN user. It is also possible to use coercion or other means to convince a VPN provider to reveal their users' identities. Identities can be discovered by following a money trail (using Bitcoin does not solve this problem because Bitcoin is not anonymous), or by persuading the VPN provider to hand over logs. Even if a VPN provider says they don't keep logs, users have to take their word for it---and trust that the VPN provider won't buckle to outside pressures that might want them to start keeping logs.
When you use a VPN, websites can still build up a persistent profile of your usage over time. Even though sites you visit won't automatically get your originating IP address, they still know how to profile you based on your browsing history.
When you use Tor the IP address you connect to changes at most every 10 minutes, and often more frequently than that. This makes it extremely dificult for websites to create any sort of persistent profile of Tor users (assuming you did not [identify yourself in other ways]( No one Tor relay can know enough information to compromise any Tor user because of Tor's [encrypted three-hop circuit]( design."
