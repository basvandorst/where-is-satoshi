That's fucking cool

Start at coinbase, learn to use GDAX and then look to branch out to Binance or Kucoins etc

I think (hope) Bitcoin ends the year on 100k and wouldn't that be fucking beautiful

I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR LIGHTNING. It will slice the throat of Btrash and bring us back to the glory days of when Bitcoin was quick and cheap
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:27:50
It's totally normal for bitcoin to drop like this
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:20:25
Hey there,
I also used to wonder why Bitcoin doesn't just increase blocksize like BCH, I then found out that increasing blocksize doesn't scale in the long run because blocksize would eventually have to be in the petabytes (Dead serious). Layer 2 scaling with Lightning seems to be the best solution as of now. It's just gonna take quite a while for segwit and lightning to be fully integrated and user-friendly.

Up you go
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:25:14
It will scale in time, just not as quick as we would like to see. Segwit and lightning look to be the way forward. Also don't forget you need Bitcoin to buy basically all other altcoins, it is the trusted name and will continue to carry cryptocurrency.

Yeah I was reading about some debit card companies not working anymore :(
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:14:30
I so badly want there to be a debit card to use Bitcoin with minimal fees. I would be all over it
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:10:57
Bitcoins supply goes down which will push the price up in the long term. Layer 2 Lightning will bring Bitcoin back lower fees and quicker transactions. Bitcoin has been declared dead so many times, I'm sure it will be declared dead many more times in the future during it's rise. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, far from being mass adopted. Look at the price from a year ago and it speaks a very different picture than just looking at prices from the last month.

Off we gooooooooo!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:32:06
I think it would have to remain like this for years  for that to happen
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:28:54
Now we can buy our drugs with more than one currency. Horay!
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:05:27
Maybe bitcoin can get you a better chair as well
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:45:43
That's an accurate feel
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:12:46
The thing is, Bitcoin has limited quantity to 21M coins. It will become more and more valuable as time goes on. I don't think it's gonna be stable for an insane amount of time and so it's not gonna be stable for a long time.

I haven't downvoted anything. my money is in BTC, not BCH.

And what is the 'Right Way'
