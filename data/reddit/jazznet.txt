If you ship it to Mexico and price it as "used" I could buy it, we can't buy it directly and I'm not using purse.io

ledger nano s from openbazaar because damn Amazon didn't ship to my country. Nice feedback from seller. Since my local currency everyday loses against the USD since 1910 I use my btc, don't look back to try to cash them to fiat money.

well, I'm still having a good time trying to set the millibits, microbits, bits, bitcoin and satoshis terms to my parents, and family members, but given that the unit is divisible to 10^-8 real fun is coming.

Github projects that you find useful or interesting, related or unrelated to bitcoin.

bitcoin is a way to get out of the dependency of a flawed system,  the investment comes when you put your bits to work to generate more bitcoins, even if it is one satoshi at a time

can't you americans use more privacy oriented services like bitsquare or localbitcoins?  or other international companies? we here in the third world that can't have by law bank accounts in USD are restricted with one or two options and that's it,  but one would believe you have the world at your finger tips thanks to your dollars,  why do you keep suffering then with coinbase? and also,  it's very sad to see people defending their disability to defy or just to question the grounds of today stupid financial laws.

In Mexico, in any fackin state, city or small town you just hang a cable from your house directly to the convertor in the street and you're all set.
Nobody gives a shit, so I do believe it could be true but yes, it also comes with the cost of the reliability, high peaks and voltage variation.

You can try using a bitwa.la debit card for emergencies, transfer small amounts of bitcoins before you use it, I suggest the bitwa.la because supports MXN

Yes, can confirm women catch it faster but their first impulse is to sell it at higher price ASAP, but they rapidly convince themselves that it's a perfect savings strategy and stop their selling idea after a couple of weeks into it.

You could import the destination wallet in an application like Mycelium, you will need the private key or the seed. I believe Exodus wallet can also make a quick rescan if you successfully import the wallet.

There is not so much anonimity in a centralized mixing service, I would prefer to use joinmarket over coinmixer.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:54:25
dude, third world countries are already happy because we can't have dollars in bank accounts, only deplorable local currencies, so having bitcoin as an option with a price always above the dollar...... 
And speculators will always speculate, it's money and money attracts greedy. The price could go low, and then lots of people will buy in the lows and the cycle will continue and price will go up again. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:44:24
I find bitsquare more easy and convenient to use against localbitcoins but there's nobody using it in my country. Hope someday it'll change.

There is a long, long, long, long, looooooong history of issues with Coinbase here and not even mentioning their current affair with the IRS (I'm not from USA so no sh1tz given), but taking all those bad records why did you sign with them? 
Also, that is internal process with them so no way in helping you, sorry m8, best regards and much love to you too &lt;3

@_date: 2016-11-25 02:01:03
he can also take with him a QR code pointing to the friend's wallet and when the ATM asks for it just show the code and avoid a possible typo

The price of bitso is always +2% above that of bitcoinaverage, the cheapest option in Mexico is volabit.com, always, that's why they reached an all time high of +15,000MXN while in volabit it never went above 14,500MXN.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:56:34
Localbitcoins.com is simple if you buy and no risky at all. Also there is bitsquare. 
Those I use, and don't ask for much personal info.
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:38:19
The inconvenient you may have is the cash out, because one would buy btc before the trip begins, but as always with a bank, it would be more useful to try an exchange to sell btc for your local currency and transfer directly and fast the fiat to your bank account, so in an emergency, you can make the cashout without problems regardless the country. Also look out for a BTC ATM near your destination and possible buyers on localbitcoins.com near your destination. 
Happy holidays &lt;3

It is very very common, new people go to XYZ web site to buy bitcoin, they see the price, they said "I don't have friggin X amount of my local currency to buy even one!!!!".
They go to currency exchange at an airport, they can give, say, 40 units of local currency for 1 usd.
I've spent my great fair of time explaining, "just focus on the amount of local currency you have, they will give you the equitative amount in bitcoins, it is ok because bitcoin is a 10 to the minus 8 so no worries"
"yes one day one satoshi will be the equivalent of a usd, but for the time being it doesn't, do not be afraid you can buy a fraction"

In this regard you are correct, "people" think and do things "tech people" will never understand why they do that, like why a teenager suicides because of bad comments on Twitter or why people buy bitcoins with fiat money and then they try to use it to pay for stuff or services, like fiat money.

As I understand, this is proposing to apply the changes BU wants along the activation of segwit and the functionality of LN?

Bitmex perpetual swap is using an average of GDAX and Bitstamp.
BTC-e, Gemini, GDAX and Kraken are almost in the same line, Bitstamp AKA "Bearstamp" because their history of being lower than the others.
OKCoin BTCUSD have the same problem as Bitfinex BTCUSD, so their price is above the other exchanges.
Edit: Personally, I'm using Bitmex XBT as a guide but GDAX, Bitstamp, BTC-e and Gemini are averaging in volume, so they are a good guideline right now.

To clarify:

Why don't you tell a +18 family member or a friend that you trust with a bank account to buy the bitcoins via SPEI from an exchange ultimately you will be paying for them.
And also there will be the matter of how to convert them into your local currency in the future.
You could very well start your own localbitcoins in whatever city you live.
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:01:06
copay.io is crossplatform,  can regenerate from seed and support multisig, way better gui than others, and I like Mycelium also.

You won't lose coins, you will get coins for both blockchains, but you can also move them into a wallet like Electrum and have coins for both blockchains after the fork.

Market will decide which one will be more valuable.
An exchange could decide to not support a blockchain, in which case, if you left your coins in such exchange, you won't get both coins.
Also, NEVER EVER leave your coins in an exchange. EVER.

This is exactly the way of think of the banking system. We need all the money right now. We don't need stupid security designs for SWIFT, nor security controls for credit cards, who cares about everything, we need all the money right now.
-&gt;But, but, please we are designing long-term well planned solutions, think of the infrastructure needed to support your demands!
No! fack everything! just increase the damn block size!
