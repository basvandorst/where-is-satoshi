I think this is useful to a newbie. Someone who has been exposed to bitcoin for long might not find it useful.
Great work, though.

Most of the time the processors just want to play by the rules. That's why it is important to think about this as a merchant. Know what your customers using bitcoin expect. Often time, customers just need to be assured that are measure to protect their data.

But you will agree most have to. And many are falling into that group with time

Though, somehow technical, I think this can be helpful to share with someone new to bitcoin

Seems like banks are becoming more accepting to bitcoin transactions, which i think is driven by them learning that bitcoin isn't really evil as they were made to place.

Indeed, it doesn't make sense why someone would need a processor accept a currency who's best feature is not needing a payment processor. However, there are thousands of merchants out there whose first duties are to their customers and their profit margins. They might want to accept bitcoin just as a way to give their customers more options, but they also want to protect their slim margins from bitcoin volatility. Processors make a lot of sense to this kind of merchants

While it might look like all processors operate using the same rules, that isn't the case. As a merchant you should also consider where the processor is registered and relevant laws in that jurisdiction.

Presumably, this is a Bitcoin-friendly bank: 
They are in Georgia, Caucasus. Apparently, it supports the operation of over 1500 Bitcoin ATMs.
Does anyone has some experience or know about them?

The hope was to have a thread here with contribution from the community. Will Google it up though. Thanks

I think they should accept bitcoin

It is in the interest of some that the myths stand

Yes, they can.
