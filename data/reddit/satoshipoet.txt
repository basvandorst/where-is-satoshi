ETH is a great coin. great team. they have some serious scaling issues that may not be solvable with their implementation. ETH 2.0 or ETH 3.0 might be the one that wins. 
bitcoin is simple tech focused on being a medium of exchange.

ETH is a centralized coin. the blockchain has been rolled back by the head dev that control 80% of the hash rate. ETH also secures much less value than Bitcoin
also the amount of data to run a "full node" equivalent is growing at an extremely rapid rate. the first major DAPP that was semi-popular (cryptokitties), proved that there are some serious engineering challenges that ETH needs to resolve.
ETH is very interesting and advanced tech but it has much greater % of breaking and rollbacks.
Bitcoin is dumb tech focused on moving Bitcoin tokens.

he nailed it
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:58:54
that is correct. but in the scenario that like 99% of people move to the new chain, you won't be able to find anyone willing to take your coins on the old chain. so its important to vote, but many historical hard forks were not controversial at all and we all successfully moved to the main chain. see hard forks in Bitcoin's first 5 years
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:17:50
ripple is probably fine in the short run. with that one tho, you never know when all the controllers will pull the rug on you (either buy selling their coins. or by announcing that ripple will be implemented by a large number of banks to settle transactions, but they wont be using xrp tokens)

in a hard fork, if people do not upgrade their software, they will be left on the original chain. in a soft fork, a new chain is not needed. 
it is kind of like a language. right now all the nodes are speaking the same language. someone can take the ledger, replicate it and change the rules of the language, but everyone speaking the old language will just ignore it. 
everyone has to agree to speak the new language or the new speaker's "nonsense" language will just be ignored

just some alt coin implosions. some pump n dumpers unloading their stashes and going back to Bitcoin. they wont be going back to where they came from
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:11:38
the main thing is that cryptocurrencies are just as much econ experiments as they are CS experiments. and Bitcoin successfully generated a large, real following of supporters. and they are not always public about it (on account of now desiring anonymity due to new found wealth), but they are real. 
for all the other alts, why not just switch to some newer, "better" tech in 6 months? what is holding you to that implementation? nothing.  there is no network effect. there are no futures on CME and CBOE. it is just a bunch of devs sitting on all their premined coins waiting to unload on the other guys.
bitcoin only has scaling problems because it has SCALE. all other coins will encounter this if they had similar scale. (like the high MB networks would suffer issues of orphan and increased miner centralization. very short block times will run into a similar issue. many more examples)

big blocks = more centralization = easier to take control of the key nodes / miners. 
also mining centralization is a big problem for Bitcoin and other cryptos. the larger the blocks, the great incentive to concentrate mining power. why? you are at a huge disadvantage if you are a single miner it takes you a long time to receive the newest block. this is not insignificant 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:58:19
Yes, just look at the success of the unexpected movements behind Obama, Bernie Sanders and Trump.  All of them were dark horses that came from nowhere, and all of them built huge bases based on small donations from a very large group of motivated people.

people see bitcoin's historical returns. they want similar returns and want to use their money. nothing is wrong with that. we cant stop them from using bitcoin, nor should we try.
bitcoin is not about excluding people just because you think they are using it for the "wrong" reasons.

Sure, ECDSA is not formally proven. Just as gravity is a theory.  I agree with all your points.  But I think we can both acknowledge that ECDSA would take an immense amount of resources to map, and only a handful of entities would be able to fund something like that right now (and even ultra low percentage to be successful).  And likely their target would not be Bitcoin if they broke it. That is not something you just give away to the world. Or use to attack such a small asset class. There is a reason govts are way far ahead in crypto research.

lol explaining the mechanics of how all the various instruments interact: buying and selling actual asset, futures market, options, etc. it is actually very difficult to understand all the subtle interactions between the instruments. but at the end of the day every position can be summarized as net long or net short an asset. 
in cryptoland it is even a bit more difficult because of the obscure nature of some of the instrument. like bitmex's daily swaps. it is a bit complex, but if you care to spend 3 - 5 hours you can learn it all easily.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:10:32
Many things are protected by ECDSA. Formally proving things in math i think is more difficult than you might think.  See Godel's incompleteness theory. Right now we don't really have a good approach to go about breaking ECDSA with existing or foreseeable technology. Theoretically if RSA-2408, ECDSA (on a 256 bit curve), SHA-1, SHA-256, and AES-256 were crackable, then likely RSA-2048 would fall first. So likely we would have a warning.
I just think you are not appreciating that most crypto research efforts are occurring in highly confidential teams and National Security is the primary objective. It is far more valuable than Bitcoin. If they broke it, we would likely have no idea.
Also just think it through, if someone cracked ECDSA and started spending the Bitcoins. Do you not think it would become worthless almost instantly when people realized what happened? Why would you accept them? Bitcoin just does not make much sense if you were capable of breaking ECDSA. Sure you might be able to get off some transactions at first, but then people will realize what happened. Do you think there would be no consequences? You have to convert to fiat or assets which can both be seized. 
You might as well get your Nobel Prize and be worshiped as a genius for the rest of your life. It would be an absolutely extraordinary mathematical feat.

the problem with alts is that you need that alt to win and for btc to do well. take a look at the coinmarketcap.com snapshots from 2 or 4 years ago. 90% of the alts have died or or lost 95% of their value. alts are always coming, and the people constantly move to the new "hot coin." also there are a lot of pump n dump groups active in the alts.

half will be on the new chain, half will be on the old chain.  everyone with any unit of the token at the time of the split will have the exact same number of units on both chains. 
so far we haven't had a 50-50 break. some have forked Bitcoin and created centralized projects, but not too many decentralized projects that have forked Bitcoin. i say that because most do not have a rigorous peer review process, they just roll out the code when the central dev team says it is ready

i may not be able to explain it to you. but it all comes down to this: its bulls vs bears. when bulls win, bears lose and vice versa. the mechanics are difficult to understand and complex, but you can just research if you want to online. but trust me that it holds

it is good to get alternate viewpoints and avoid echo chambers. but Satoshi started Bitcoin as an open source project. he understood that there would be massive changes needed to scale Bitcoin. we need to continue to implement changes to scale Bitcoin. read up on ASICBoost and how SegWit prevents it. then you will understand the real reason they make that argument.

there are centralized coins that have less secure networks and are vulnerable to attack that might process transactions faster. they also  have devs sitting on a massive number of coins just waiting to exit.
sure, the tech may or may not be better. but the key with Bitcoin it is by far the largest, most secure, and largest number of actual users. 
its all tradeoffs. and if any of the other coins approached Bitcoin's trxn volume, they would have the same issues (and more for some of them)

Did he provide the private key used to send the encrypted disclosure yet? Conveniently the timestamping service he chose to use only timestamps once per day, way after the bug was disclosed.

there are just as many anti-bitcoiners as there are bitcoiners. also price speculation is generally frowned as a topic here, so i think those are 2 big reasons why you are downvoted. dont let it affect you too much and ignore the haters.  
i think the price quite a bit immediately, maybe about 10%. then depends on where the coins go. if a lot keep moving, then probably more drop. if just some moved, probably not a big deal.

Exactly this. Most people have no clue how the financial system actually works. So people that understand it and criticize it are often labelled as "crazy" by ignorant people that just eat up the spoon-fed bullshit propagated by MSM and western economists. They would actually probably agree with the "crazies" if they truly understood the system.

@_date: 2019-01-15 06:40:13
Its in its infancy, we don't need to rush its use as a medium of exchange before the technology is ready. 2nd layer solutions are necessary.  Making sure that it is an absolutely trustworthy SoV with no issues (or foreseeable future issues) is the main task at hand right now. Once we prove that, medium of exchange will follow. Walk before we can run.
But I do agree that it is good to spend it, just do it when it makes sense. Don't go out of your way or force others to do so.
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:48:04
the retardation levels on this sub are getting too dam high. this has nothing to do with the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:50:27
\&gt; The waiter was wrong. First of all coinbase will NOT be blocked from  sending to ANY bitcoin address as long as you put in an address and not  an email. 
\&gt; The waiter likely did not know this, only that if the fee is set too  low, the transaction will sit in the mempool for a while and ultimately  be returned if it is cleared out before network fees are low enough to  send it. 
You are wrong, and the other posters are right. Coinbase won't send the transaction immediately. It needs to review the transaction before sending, sometimes manually. Most (if not all) POS software for Bitcoin will detect unconfirmed transactions. If it doesn't receive in 10 minutes or something, it will send the Bitcoin back to sender, so the waiter was correct about everything. 
So OP, you need to contact Coinbase and let them know the situation. They will likely attribute the BTC back to your account, but it will take a little while to get this resolved.  As other posters have said, if you want to pay with BTC in such a setting, you should control your own private keys so you can send the transaction right away. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:16:37

In the USA the federal minimum wage is $7.50, but only $2.13 for employees that receive tips. The OP is about a pizza delivery guy. If you receive satisfactory service, you definitely should be tipping. 
If you cannot afford to receive satisfactory service and pay for that service, you shouldn't be eating there.
I do agree with your point of view, but only if you are talking about a tip when it is not customarily expected.

\&gt; Not trying to force anyone to spend, sorry if I am coming across that way. 
For sure, didn't mean to be accusatory towards you; was more just referring to some widespread, prevailing views about the topic is all. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:27:56
Good points. I don't think many would argue that decentralized systems are the best method for **all** systems.  Only some. For some things, centralized systems are undoubtedly better.
1) Centralized solutions are cheaper. Consider Amazon vs. Filecoin. Amazon can buy hard drives in bulk and receive large discounts. They can pass those savings onto their customers. The Filecoin users providing storage to customers will have to 1) convince customers that their technology is safe 2) offer cheaper service. There isn't a trust issue with Amazon. So why would customers move to Filecoin?
--Why isn't there a trust issue with Amazon? Large tech companies have repeatedly abused the trust of their customers. 
2) Centralized solutions are much faster. Yes, there is a bunch of work being done now to allow for smaller transactions (lightning networks, plasma). There's no proof this is going to work. High level scaling solutions remain academic.
--Blockchain is incredibly young.  Things will improve over time. We are in the very early days.
3) Development takes longer because the software has to operate in a trustless environment. Every update, no matter how minor, requires an independent security audit. There are quite a few examples of why security audits are not optional.
--I would view this as a feature rather than a bug. Many open source projects took much longer, but ultimately resulted in much better projects than centralized projects.  One major reason? Companies must respond to their customers' demands right away.  As a result, they tend to have very short term thinking. A great example would be .NET vs. open source solutions.
4) Because money is involved forks can be contentious. The default is to do nothing. A centralized solution with a board of directors and CEO can outpace a blockchain community in development speed and time to market.
--Which company has been outpacing the blockchain community in development? I understand your point in theory, but I don't think it matches reality.
5) If the private keys are lost or stolen the consumer is screwed. That makes blockchain technology incredibly risky. It's still safer to pay friends with Chase QuickPay. Banks also have insurance. How can a blockchain be insured?
--This is a central feature not a bug.  Again, using Bitcoins / crypto for everything is not necessarily the endgame for all Bitcoiners. There is a place for traditional banking and blockchains.
6) Smart contracts are too rigid to replace the legal system. One option is to use an oracle as a source of information. However, using oracles to pull data from outside the blockchain means most of the logic is centralized.
--I don't think many people are suggesting that smart contracts should replace the legal system. Smart contracts will be most useful for things like clearing trades, etc. in the short term.

1 additional hodler / 1 additional bitcoin held doesn't really take away liquidity or result in an overall net increase in volatility, it just raises the price level for each Bitcoin--nothing more.  Sure, if you wanted to actively trade all your bitcoin, then yea, you would add to liquidity, but then fees would eventually eat you alive, and your money would just go to the exchanges as you said.
Agree with the rest of your points.  
hodl bitcoin --&gt; increase price level --&gt; incentivize more miners. All other effects are more 2nd and 3rd order. (Like increase in price level increases coverage of Bitcoin, encouraging more people to look into it).

Cleared very fast. Already down to 2.1k transactions and cleared every transaction above 1 sat/byte. That is one advantage of shitcoins using SHA-2 as a hashing algorithm! Lets BTC pull in additional firepower when needed.

If you can't afford to tip in the recipient's preferred currency, you shouldn't be eating there.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:11:55
Only tip if the recipient actually wants it though. Tipping someone in Bitcoin when they know nothing about it is very rude. You are basically forcing them to spend a lot of time to collect the tip.

@_date: 2018-03-13 01:23:58
we live in a society so reliant on centralized authority, that it is tough for us to imagine certain services without it. the centralized authority is also incentivized to make us think that without it we would not have these services. other cultures and societies historically did not have similar structures, yet they still had roads, healthcare, local organizations to dispense justice, etc. 
businesses will build roads because it will bring customers. they will maintain them for the same reason. healthcare will develop because people are willing to pay for it, so smart people will provide healthcare. most people living permanently in area what a safe environment for their families. they will create systems to dispense justice and local communities will agree on how to do so, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:09:40
i would recommend:
1. move Bitcoins to new address (so your private key can no longer move your btc)
2. create coinomi wallet (can use blue stacks as an emulator)
3. extract private key from Ledger nano S
4. import private key into Coinomi for Bitcoin Gold
5. Convert BTG into preferred holding
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:36:55


That is what I wrote, it is accurate. If a person doesn't know about Bitcoin, they will have to spend a good bit of time to figure out how to spend it. They will also have to research about where they can actually spend it. It is also easy for them to mess up by not setting appropriate fee, etc. So yes, if they want to spend the tip, then yes, you are forcing them to sacrifice a lot of their time. Especially for people that are not computer savvy.

I believe if you already have the BCH on Coinbase, then you may be able to exchange them on Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). Not sure 100% but saw someone say that on another sub.

I do agree that many of these coins were complete or nearly completely scams with basically 1% chance of actually surviving.

The loss of the investors' money is punishment enough.

Just to clarify, there were practically incessant block size debates on this forum for 3+ years. Its just at a certain point, it just became a constant rehashing of the same exact talking points over and over and over... Eventually it became toxic trolling as the discussions were not in good faith, and  everyone had decided on their point of view.  Most of their community are not devs, whereas Bitcoin devs were wasting precious time constantly debating the same points with time-sucking trolls. For the sake of allowing healthy discussion of other topics, I think it was needed to move on at a certain point (I certainly understand how others could see it differently).
They got their own chain and we have ours, so each of us can just compete on the merits of our own chains / communities.  If you want to have good faith discussions with them, go for it, but mainly I think we each just let each other be and pursue our own roadmaps. Unfortunately both sides have done a lot of toxic trolling in the others' forums, so I can understand why they react in a knee-jerk / impulsive manner to Bitcoin supporters. Let them be and may the best chain win. We are really all on the same side IMHO.
