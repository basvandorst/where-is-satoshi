It keeps telling me my password is wrong which is strange since I used lastpass to save it. So I tried using my recovery key to reset the password but the recovery page keeps giving me a captcha incorrect error but there isn't even a captcha on the page. I'm on the latest Chrome on OS X if it matters.
Ok figured out the captcha thing. Got this error in console and had to allow "unsafe scripts"
"Blocked a frame with origin " from accessing a frame with origin "chrome-extension://hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd".  The frame requesting access has a protocol of "https", the frame being accessed has a protocol of "chrome-extension". Protocols must match."
I guess this is because I use lastpass for passwords. As now the login after resetting my password is still complaining with similar errors.
And now it says I've been locked out of my account for too many attempts. The last few attempts I copy/pasted the password in, not using a lastpass autofill.
edit: After all that, I entered a password in manually (and was still locked out after resetting the password with the special key). It finally worked!
Wallet looks nice so far:

It's just an awkward wording. It's saying that while speaking to readandwhite about having FriendlyChemist killed, this previous 80k instance was mentioned.

It seems to be doing something even worse for me. I use lastpass as well but the username and password fields wouldn't autofill with lastpass so I manually copy/pasted into the fields and it still kept giving me incorrect password errors and eventually locked my account.
Reset the account and set in a simple password manually and it still locks me out.
Perhaps if a password is reset through the special key it should unlock the account if it's locked?

Thanks, this helped me fix my issue.
