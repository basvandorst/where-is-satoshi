I always found the best way to get a response from Bittrex was just replying to the support email multiple times. (the email you het when you first open your ticket, with "reply above this line" on it)
Write response, copy, hit send, then..
Click reply, paste, send...
Click reply, paste, send...
Click reply, paste, send...
That's what I did last time, got a response in 3 hours.
You know how to let me know if it works:

That's actually pretty fast for paypal.

You cannot do it.
I've been through this end to end with Coinbase (over the course of three months)
They have a GBP wallet on their site, but do not support GBP deposits or withdrawals.
The only way is SEPA, in Euro.
As a UK player, your options are:
Localbitcoins (expensive, scammy, shitty)
Kraken (potentially, I've never tried it)
Coinfloor (very, very expensive, £2500 MINIMUM deposit)
Bittylicious (some people said they sold byc to it, but I've only ever seen the "buy btc" option)
It's total dogshit doing crypto in the UK.

1: It's not free to send on PayPal, they just charge at the receiving end instead.
2: Unless you're prepared to give PayPal ALL your data, forget about it.
3: A person sending you money through PayPal can have the transaction reversed.
4: PayPal only works in certain countries and keeps records of all your transactions and you are not allowed to delete.
5: If PayPal think you're doing something dodgy (even if you're really not) they can block your account and withhold tour funds.
6: PayPal like to withhold funds for arbitrary amounts of time; this might not affect you if you've been with them for years, but a new account will get battered by it, even if you're just using it to send money to some friends.

You have a txid for each deposit and withdrawal, once it's there, the user's involvement with the wallet ends and everything else is done with a simple database, such as mysql (not entirely sure what they use). The user's "balance" is maintained in that database until a user decides to withdraw and then the wallet is used again to process the withdrawal.
edit: The wallet is used one other time; to create addreases.

@_date: 2017-11-28 15:50:17
You need to have the private key or seed for the wallet.
A private key looks like a string of letters and numbers.
A seed is 12 words 
Or, a wallet.dat file, and considerating how long ago this must have been, I'd say that's what you'd need.
Get the wallet.dat file. Download Bitcoin Core. Let it sync (go watch the star wars films back to back, do a day's work, take the kids for a trip to Disneyland, restore a classic car and build a house), once sync'd, close the programme and then go to c:\users\yourName\appdata\roaming\bitcoin and replace the wallet.dat file with your wallet.dat file, say Yes when windows asks if you want to overwrite the original file, then open Bitcoin Core again and it should do a rescan, and then it will load your wallet.
Good luck.

Depends how much effort it takes to crack one open.  Effort is energy, and energy is always a trade off. How would cracking it affect your carbon emissions? At the end of the day, people are fleeting, the planet remains, the real morality is what condition it'll be in when we're done, and how much of an effect did your bitcoin thievery have. If the answer is "not a massive amount" (which would be correct, all things considered), then I'd say go for it.

Pretty sure dodging probate is illegal, but what you need to do is get the bitcoins to an exchange, such as Coinbase, or Localbitcoins; one which has fist currency pairs (that is to say where USD etc can be exchanged for Bitcoin).
You'll first need to create an exchange account, add your bank account, and go through any verification process that may be required. Once done, you need to [send the bitcoin]( to your deposit address on the exchange.
Once it's there you'll need to go into the trading market and sell your bitcoin for USD, then withdraw the USD.

I've used it for both.
Spending has been on:
Pot, yep I bought some, it was years ago, I have a local guy now, his stuff is better than DNMs.
Trezor; bought my hardware wallet.
VPN; NordVPN take Bitcoin.
P2P; I have sent it to, and received it from, friends for the repayment of, say, lunch, or gassing up the car for a road trip etc. The fiat was spent initially, the bitcoin sent as settlement. If gas stations and restaurants took bitcoin, that would be easier.
Gardening supplies; a local garden centre takes it. It's not what I call a *proper* garden centre (they have a cafe, and don't sell wheelbarrows, but they do have plants, soil, potting and such)
Remuneration; I fix computers and such on the side of my normal job, Bitcoin is an option for payment, but most people needing outside help to fix computers doesn't onow what Bitcoin is. I do gardening jobs as well in the summer, last year I was taking Litecoin and Bitcoin for that.

It's ok when he and his doing it. His issue with people playing bitcoin is that it's the *wrong* people, i.e. poor people.

keep them on coinbase until you've done the required reading and then select an appropriate wallet
