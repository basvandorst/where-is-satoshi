Think through this math though. 
If the value of a fiat currency, let's say the peso, drops radically relative to BTC, then it might be $100,000,000 pesos to one BTC. 
A stock of an important company, say Google, will not really be worth any more or less than it did before. Google is still as big as Google is. But that share of Google stock might now cost $100,000,000 pesos. 
So the value of a peso can go way down relative to a BTC, and as a result a house, a share of stock, a Lambo etc. will be a low number of BTC and a high number of pesos. Dig?

And bitcoin keeps on not caring.

That is a blanket statement reflecting your own opinion or possibly the opinion of someone else. 
Lightening will help solve some of the few irritations with BTC which are potentially high transaction fees, speed of transactions and practicalness of micro transactions. 
This is a group trying to improve the world using BTC. Let's get on with the job at hand.

And within this comment lays great wisdom. In 100 years no one will give a crap what happened to all that funny paper.

And the internet too. Internet will be gone. Then TV. I also think electricity will be gone soon. The graphs say the wheel is on the way out.
