What are some things to consider when you decide to invest in a coin?

Thank you so much! I could never get a full understanding of crypto and the blockchain until I went through your site. Went through it all in about an hour.

Oh yeah forgot to add that. Thanks!

Not sure exactly yet - I'm deciding whether or not I want to prioritize short term trading or long term holding before prices shoot up.

Oh okay so I should look into how each coin works and compare to others as well. I like the idea of making decisions for myself too, not everyone who seems like they know what they're doing actually do. 
Thanks for the info!

I went through the wiki and a few others websites and Bitcoin really don't seem as complicated as I thought they were.
Pretty much the ways people are making money off of the Blockchain technology is by
ICO's and Projects (very broad)
Using altcoins' utilities
And buying and holding/trading?
For someone hoping to get into crypto, I think this makes it a lot simpler. I'd appreciate it if someone could let me know if I missed something.

Yeah I'm trying to do research to figure out what to look for in the technology or team behind coins or platforms. Not just put my money in something without researching.

I tried applying for a few services, like Gdax, that do record checks for ID, but I haven't been able to get through any of them. I think it might be because I turned 18 recently. If this is the case, does anyone know how long it should take for them to verify me? Or any other ideas of what I can do? I live in the US

Is there a website that compares fees from exchanges?
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:07:33
Thanks I'll look into it! 
I put $10 into Coinbase then my wallet and between them and miners fees it ate almost $4. I heard about Gdax and it having no fees, but it looks like Coinbase is where they get most of their money from.
