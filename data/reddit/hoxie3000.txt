Hopefully they release some dirt on him like bribes/corruption/black panther and he will never have a place in politics ever again. Good riddance.

And the pot calls the kettle black. Wow.

Once again you twist shit to fit your needs. How typical. Where did I say to get rid of them? I simply pointed out how much good they obviously do. You named Bernie. Wow. One whole rich person, oh that's right. Not anymore! That's why he got busted. Conspiracies you say? I bet you are one of the nuts who talked down to anyone who claimed the government was spying on all of us. Just because you call it a conspiracy doesn't mean it can't be true. Do you really think the cops or SEC give two shits about you? There is a reason we have multiple levels on punishment in this country. The rich and famous are given light sentences and the book is thrown at the average citizen. Why is it such a stretch for you to understand they take care of their own. But yet you'll just twist things around again to fit your new context and go on with your high horse. You're just ridiculous and sound like a government shill. How much are you getting paid to ride their nuts?

You dont consider money as earned until the product is delivered. I will quote clients a price but only ask for payment when I physically have their item ready to ship. Good business practices would have not put BFL in this predicament to begin with.

Because those laws and consequences sure do turn all the criminals away from wall st. Get real man.

And yet here we are. I suggest you learn what that phrase actually means.

My point is that more laws and regulations don't mean shit to someone who is breaking the law. You're SEC is worthless when they selectively pick who to prosecute and who has enough money to buy their way out. Stop twisting shit and accept the fact that you are wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:47:32
Wow. You can't even make up your mind. You're either a troll or a total fucking moron. I say both.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:10:31
And what of the big money guys who get away with theft on the scale of millions of dollars? What the fuck has the SEC ever done to be worth a dime? Yep, my point still stands. Try again.

I live outside nashville about 5 hours from their memphis warehouse. Always next day when shipping from there via ups. Downside, taxes.

I'd like to know what side of this issue you are on, as well as what you had for breakfast.

Someone already downvoted you, they must not be a fan of south park. I upvoted you to make up for it :)

Oh my god typo. Not acceptable. Everyone sell and boycott.

I was told this sub was a circlejerk. After reading the replies, yep. It's some of the stinkiest gay pumps and dumps I've ever read through.

If you want to cash out without alarming the bank or authorities, buy gold or silver with btc and sell It in person somewhere. Obviously you will take a hit on the price, but you go from bitcoins to cash without a bank or IRS ever knowing.
