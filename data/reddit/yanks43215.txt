Changetip is awesome.  Has it been around for very long?  I must have never payed any attention to it... I just made an account though!!

I just created an account but I don't fully know how this works,  do I need my account topped with bitcoin before I can recieve a tip?  And can anyone claim my tip?

I use a bitcoin wallet website?  What do you recommend?

Just bought a mining rig from a swedish company, what's my next move?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:25:25
Alright, that clears up a bit more. The rig I am getting is 550 gh/...where does that compare on the scale of other rigs and how long will that be relevant before it becomes technologically slow

It should be shipped out in mid november...I'm a noob when it comes to this...I'm trying to do research. When the coins are mined, where are they sent?

What would be a better investment?  Buying bitcoins by themselves or mining for them?  What are pros and cons to each?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:09:50
After the rig is hooked up, what's the next step, setting up a wallet? Find out where the bitcoins are stored?
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:09:38
Well I split a rig with some friends, just trying to learn

Thank you for this... do you have to link into a mining pool or can you just free lance?
