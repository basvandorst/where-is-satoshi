he and so many others don't.  I'm sick of the 'pet rock' or beanie baby analogy or trying to compare it to the stock market or anything similar. 
They really don't have a clue what they're talking about.

What I'm upset about are how firms in the US and in Europe are horrified of cryptocurrency and they keep causing these mini crashes.  "Bitcoin's real value is zero!" or "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme! Stay away!"  I remember a while back I got the chance to confront a guy about it and he couldn't explain one bit about it but acted as if he did.  
They keep trying to apply stock market trends to a currency.  The outside world who knows little about it run to them for advice and all they'll say is stay way. Meanwhile folks like Bill Gates and so many other tech billionaires who've studied it for a long time say otherwise.  It's not going away.  However, seeing the masses are still so unfamiliar with it and the news keeps interviewing JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, it's going to keep doing these insane dives and climbs.
Someone should put together some kind of website for dummies.  A literal hold your hand kind of site that might come with some kind of entertaining animation or something.  I'm sure something like this exists on YouTube in video form but you know what I'm saying. It's the only way you can get people to stay focused long enough.  It's near impossible to get people to read anymore!

First I'd need to know if you've ever studied economics. This answer for you might go over your head.  If you're reading opinions by random people on Reddit as your main source of knowledge about cryptocurrencies, then you're going to be bombarded with everything under the sun.
I'll be as straight and pithy as possible here to explain it.
Currencies are like ALL commodities; they can be traded by speculation, or as a medium of exchange for investments.  All currencies, no matter if it's the Yen, the dollar, Bitcoin or Indian beads will rise and fall because of the law of supply and demand.  Investment in, speculation, all forms of activity with investments will contribute to it.  All of these things attribute to what's happening with Bitcoin.  It's very popular, people want it, there is only so much of it and so the value goes up.
You can have a booming economy but a piss poor currency - and vice versa.  The USA is a great example of this with its thriving economy but dollar that isn't worth as much as it once was.  However, the dollar is just printed fiat and means nothing but what the holder deems it to be because the government says its 'worth' something.  
Currencies have been traded against each other for ages. For the US dollar, if it goes off too far from what the US sees it needs to be, the government will begin to artificially adjust the supply and demand.  
Bitcoin doesn't have any regulation.  Its value is based strictly on the aforementioned reasons.  There are no actors stepping in and adjusting its supply - we already know its supply and it's capped off at 21 million.  The more that people have it and want it, the HIGHER the value of it is.   Supply and demand in action.

Wow!  That is a LOT of money!  I'd be more than angry.

I'm am absolutely clueless how China has that as an official policy right now.  From what I understand if that system goes down, Bitcoin could be disrupted for weeks they're saying.

If you don't read the whitepaper (and actually understand it) or see some serious plan by those who developed the coin, buying would be dumb.

If you want to send 10 dollars, then Coinbase isn't for you.  If this is to an individual, I'd go another route.  If a company with some kind of fee or service, I'd use a real exchange like Bittrex or something.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:09:57
Go away FUD.  If you want to talk shop about Bitcoin and other coins, then give some meat to your jabbering.  If it's not a a currency, then why are millions of people after it to use as a currency.  Why are so many companies now offering to take it as a means of exchange? 
Come on guy, if your'e going to comment, at least use some data to back it up.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:16:42
It's not a fad or a product is why.  It's certainly not a company on the stock market.  
Would you equate silver, platinum or gold with a beanie baby?

Mr. Rothschild wasn't the first to know this.  Every money changer since the time money became a thing has known this. 
My fear with cybercurrency is who controls the operations of the majority of the Internet?  We know this answer.  The second question is how vulnerable is an attack on stated Internet?

China's giant bitcoin mining facility scares me quite frankly.

My bet is on Ethereum and Ripple.  Ripple is being eyed by many banks, which negates what a lot of people went to it for but I'm not the maker of the future, just the predictor. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:59:46
well, if you're a store in the US paying taxes and you agree to accept Bitcoin, which you know they're converting back over to cash, there'd would have to be some kind of protection.  
But all is cool now.  They sent me a note they got it and what I purchased is on its way.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:51
No, don't freak out.  There is the problem with folks buying into BC.  This isn't a stock option and if you're just into it for making a massive profit, then you shouldn't be messing around.  Just look at the past 10 years. and it's a steady incline.  This is just a dip because of people acting stupid over infighting and rumors.  It's not going anywhere.  Selling is just wasting your Bitcoin away and giving some Nerd in rural China some great deal - don't let some nerd in China take your Bitcoin, be a man.  
btw, Etherum is cool too - I'm just saying!  
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:52:59
Any silver or platinum?

I'm not sure who Japan Morgan is, but I'm glad they're not a hoax either.

I have never owned a credit card nor would I ever in my life get one.  If someone starting out in life asked me if they needed a credit card I'd tell them no.  In fact nobody needs a credit card.  They're scams and ripoffs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:07
Yes and it's steadily risen since then.  You want back history I guess.  Do you actually use Bitcoin a lot or just talking?  Look, if you own it and are terrified, well, sell it all and never look at it again.  
So for the sake of numbers I'm going to go back to satisfy those of you that are new to money or something.  These are big events where little scares made people do things but not necessarily...it's most of the year in review.  All in US dollars.
November 9, it's 726.36.  Trump is elected and 10 days later it's 749.10
Jan 3, 2017 - breaks 1K for 1020.47, drops to 806.24 10 days later
March 10, it's at 1201.87 - 10 days later it drops 1037.85 after the US government denied the application of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, to operate an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to make it easier for investors to buy Bitcoin.
SEC denies second Bitcoin ETF application - March 28, 2017 $1044.25 ten days later it's $1190.39
In April, Japan says bitcoin is legal to use as money- began at 1085.03 - ten days later it's 1215.69
August 1 it's at 2787.85 and then splits into Bitcoin cash - ten days later it's at 3383.79
etc etc... 
So, 726.36 in November of 2016 of last year and now today, at ~11 Mountain it's at 13,389.92
If you sell now, it would be foolish.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:10:17
Well, now it's up to someone to offer a new technology along with bitcoin that both parties can agree too.  For example, "we offer BitProof here"  (I'm calling it BitProof).  So it'll be 'key' and 'lock' kind of thing like PGP.  It would be just some secondary proof payment was made.  It shouldn't be hard for someone who knows how to write code. 
Anyone out there reading this thinking it's a good idea and knows how, please call it BitProof - it just sounds cool.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:05:22
Great Find, but who's the author?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:39
What's the big deal people?  Come on.  It has to come back!  Think GLOBAL.  This is essentially a new thing with hiccups.  It's volatile because of a lot of really smart dumdums not getting along.  Stuff happens.  WAY too many companies are going the route of cryptocurrency.  
In fact it's rising now!  Just chill, drink a beer, talk to your old lady - talk to your old man.  All is good in cryptotown.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:06:11
I JUST got alerted by them they got it.
I KNOW what happened. They purposely held it until the price of the coin went up again.  They were acting like they never got it because just after I sent the coin over, the price dropped.  I had a suspicion that was what was going on there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:44:15
EXACTLY. It's not going anywhere!  Don't buy into paranoia coming from people who don't know what they're doing or work with stock options for a living but have never fully understood how cryptocurrency works.  If you take advice from a stock broker about cryptocurrency, it's bad advice.  I've listened to so-called experts during investment talks on TV and they haven't a clue what they're talking about.  They keep trying to apply Wall Street kinds of ideas to this and it just doesn't work that way.  
Bitcoin is fairly young, it's just now really taking off, as well as so many new and wonderful altcoins.  Don't sweat it.  This is long term and for adoption - it's not just a profit thing.  It's good folks got in early but remember it's the end game here.  LONG TERM.  THINK 2-5 years.  Seriously. Even if it dips to 8-9K.

Yep.  "Come to us at JP Morgan, we're trusted.  Just don't count that big economic crash that we helped create.  But hey!  You're okay now, right!?"
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:44:43
yeah and it's risen since then?  I'm not getting your point here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:32:33
My man/woman!  See.  People are being stupid if they really think Bitcoin has a permanent drop.  That's really amateur thinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:34:54
No. Big deal.  We're just talking shop.  Over 14,600 now.  I'm getting more Ethereum and Ripple. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:55:45
EXACTLY!!!! this is a super coin sale in my opinion.  A coin sale!

Haaaaay, it's me again.  Yeah, just looking at my library with all my books.  I read, yeah.  Got a Lambo but meh, big deal.  I like my books better...blah blah blah blah blah.
Tai Lopez is a con-artist.  He offers nothing but the same thing everyone else already knows.  In fact he didn't come on the scene until long after Bitcoin started skyrocketing and saw that was the way to make his mark.
His wealth comes from offering courses  - not from anything he's done on his own.  So the charm is "Look at me, I'm rich I have cars and two big mansions and you can be this way too if you get my courses."  The thing is, he ONLY got that because of the courses offered.  
It's the oldest con game in the world.  First pretend to be rich, offer a course on getting rich and get rich from the courses.  If you have the gift to talk like you know something, you can do anything.
Televangelists have been doing it for ages!
