If you want to try out a KeepKey - we have an awesome new client. It's a holistic platform for self-sovereign finance. Built on a principle that we call “keys-out,” in which your private keys are secured on hardware, and yet you’re able to interact with your crypto in an easy way.  
Let me know if you would like a 60% off code.

Hi u/Jonnyjohnsonson
You are on the right track! The safest way to store your crypto will be in a hardware wallet. Coinbase is a fantastic service for buying and selling BTC, but in order to store your funds safely and have control over your private keys, you'll want to switch over to a hardware wallet. I'm from KeepKey, and we're the hardware solution from ShapeShift. We've got some great promotions running right now for 60% off a KeepKey. Use code STAYSAFE60 [keepkey.com](
Our global support team is around 24/7 to assist you with setting up the new device or with any other crypto-related questions you may have. KeepKey is also releasing a new interface very soon that allows you to view your balances, send/receive funds, trade crypto, and have a portfolio view of your hodlings. It's real pretty! and easy to use! 
If you have any questions, let me know, and once again, kudos to you for enhancing your crypto knowledge and asking the right Q's!

Hey there u/ucnunes! I apologize that I am just seeing this post now. Would you mind [opening up a ticket]( with our support team so we can confirm the security of the device?

Both KeepKey and Trezor are great cold storage options and can be connected to [beta.shapeshift.com](  which offers a beautiful interface and user-friendly access to your assets (no KYC required unless you want to do trades). With a large display, KeepKey offers the ability to see full addresses when sending, receiving, and trading. In our opinion, one button as opposed to two also makes the KeepKey easier to use. Both hardware wallets offer the ability to add a passphrase\* onto the existing 12-word recovery sentence with adds an extra layer of security.   
\*The native KeepKey client supports passphrases and we plan on adding this feature to [beta.shapeshit.com]( in the future.  
For deciding between the two, you may want to look at which coins/tokens are supported by each.

I have been able to successfully connect my KeepKey with Galaxy S9+ but KeepKey/ShapeShift has not yet been optimized for mobile. So while it is possible, it can be difficult; the user experience is much better on desktop. We are working on optimizing the experience for mobile.

Yes - if your keys are stored offline on a hardware or paper wallet then you are using cold storage or a hot wallet. We have an article with info about wallet types [here]( if you want to learn more.   
The cool thing about using a hardware wallet with an online app or platform is that you can view your coins in a dashboard &amp; watch the prices changes.
