The answer is dependent upon how much the money you hold in an exchange is worth to you. If you lost it tomorrow, how significant of a loss would it be?
**tl;dr:** Yes. Don't store on an exchange.

**Likely scenario:** CEO goes around talking about how a potential investment he has yet to be briefed on is a ponzi scheme while his team behind the scenes figures out their angle in the cryptocurrency world. Why? Because if he goes on national television evangelizing something he has yet to stick his fingers into the headlines read: "CEO of JP Morgan loves bitcoin" and then he loses.
**Unlikely scenario:** CEO of JP Morgan is stupid
**Bitcoiner's dream scenario:** [CEO of JP Morgan is shaking in his boots because traditional investments are going to be disrupted entirely and his house of cards is folding in front of his eyes](

The general go-to exchange is coinbase.com. In your situation, fees are negligible. Given that you've used the pound symbol, maybe there's a non-US based exchange that might be better for you but someone else will have to chime in.


Familiarize yourself with a wallet and how to back it up. This is crucial. Don't keep your coins on an exchange.

This address has no transactions. If this is the address you "sent" your your BTC to, your coins are still with Coinbase.
Go to Coinbase &gt; Accounts &gt; BTC Wallet &gt; Transactions 
Do you see your sent transaction? Click it and then click "View transaction". Paste Blockcypher URL.

There's going to be a lot of discouraging replies to this. Disregard them and do it for the learning experience and enjoyment of running a node.
Consider maintaining a node even after your month of free electricity runs out. If you're invested in BTC, running a node is contributing to your own investment.

tl;dr I don't know, talk to a CPA.
I do know you'll want to keep records of your transactions. AFAIK, this is a gray area as far as *how* you should be filing. What isn't gray is if you should, yes you have to pay taxes.
It's going to be dependent on your location, too. Assuming you're in the United States, a 1099b might be the best route.

They couldn't choose to facilitate a higher exchange price and eat the difference as the cost of business to attract new people?
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:07:22
My advice to anyone that has come into money is to sit on it for a while. Think about it, it's not going anywhere. Prolong desire and think. If a fat stack o' cash showed up in one's bank account today, many would spend it tomorrow. It's easy to get caught excitement of new money - let that wear off before you spend it. It's great that you're thinking instead of knee-jerk reacting.

@_date: 2017-05-17 05:05:30
No. This user is being facetious at best, cynical at worst. 
Since your plan is to buy and hold for a couple years, than transaction fees are irrelevant to your situation. Cost averaging already mentioned is the best way to go if you want to invest a significant amount. I don't know what $200 means to you, but I wouldn't bother with cost averaging - just buy and hold.
