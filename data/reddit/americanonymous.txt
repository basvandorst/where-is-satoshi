That's not what they're saying. They are saying that yes, while it would remove the virus, it could have done damage other damage to the system. The virus is gone but the damage could still be there, or other viruses from that one virus. It all depends on what it does.

Nah, that would waste money. People should just do their civic duty and smack people like that out of principle.

Depends on what it's doing, but yes that's why I said I hate Linux elitists, acting like there's no possible way to infect their system or something. To affect your files and documents then no it wouldn't need root, but in relation to this conversation (i.e. a virus adding a script to download other viruses, installing stuff, damaging core system files, etc.) then yes it would require higher permissions. The user would have to be tricked in to entering their password to allow it to do so. That's why a _good_ Linux user will be careful with that (realistically any user should be careful with what they approve). Which is also why I say only use Java if you need to, because there are many Java exploits and malware that are also cross-platform. Sometimes you don't know what you're running on a page.

It seems like people hear about others buying when the price is low and selling them when the price goes up so it sounds like a pyramid scheme or a "get rich quick" scheme. Any time I hear people who don't like it talk about it, they call it a pyramid scheme, which doesn't make sense because a pyramid scheme is where you get money from introducing it to new people and make more money off of those people who introduce it to new people and so on... Bitcoin just doesn't work like that.
In short it seems like it's mostly just people who talk about it without bothering to understand how it works first.

I'm pretty sure they were just being sarcastic.

So explain that you aren't investing in a business and expecting a return. It's not stocks. It's an online currency.
The main point of a ponzi scheme and a pyramid scheme is that you invest in something hoping for high returns and it never pays out because your investment disappears. Bitcoin missing every single requirement for it to be either of them.
I did mention this in [another thread]( as well.

I really wish Bitcoin or Litecoin would do this...
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:20:23
As much as I like the concept of bitcoin, I think petitions are worthless.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:31:43
It already does work though. People already use it. You seem to be saying that it won't work as a complete replacement for paper currency or the U.S. dollar. That's not the point or goals of Bitcoin.


Not necessarily true. [People don't trust banks.]( Yes, the *vast majority* of people would rather have the convenience of a bank, but that goes back to the first thing, you seem to be assuming that bitcoin is "working" when it's completely replaced paper money which isn't the point of it.

It's true that things like Flash and Java are cross platform so malware written in Java and executed from the browser could affect any system that has it. The thing is the strict user privileges. Realistically it comes down to that because it wouldn't be able to do much without accessing root. The user would have to knowingly give their permission for it to actually access the system... Then there is sandboxing. Personally, I just say don't run Java from something you don't know/trust. I don't even use it to avoid issues like this all together. It also downloads a Windows executable (.exe) file. So really Linux users shouldn't have an issue with this. In case there is something embedded in the site, just blacklist it for JS and don't allow Java, or don't go to it in the first place. Problem solved.
I do hate elitists though. It makes the rest of us Linux users look bad.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:41:45
Aye. G+ actually isn't that bad. It's more like a blend of Twitter and Facebook, you end up searching tags and conversing that way but it's not a micro blog tool like Twitter.

If English was their second language they just helped them...

Yeah that's what I mean. The main principle of both is they are designed to make you believe you're going to get a huge payout but your investment never really pays out (in short).

That's not how language works. There are different connotations and feelings behind certain words given the context, which is what you described. That doesn't mean words have no true meaning. It just means you have to understand the context.

A "new internet" would just be reinventing the wheel. We'd just be doing the same thing over, trying to expand and get people and companies on board. Sounds more like a waste of time to me.
One of the main points the article seems to make is that the internet is used by the government and corporations to spy on people. Theoretically if you're connected to any network, you could be spied on. They would find a way to do it on another "internet" If they really wanted to. If you are worried about a host or ISP or something like that censoring your public opinion for whatever reason, it's not hard to host said content elsewhere. So what other reason would there be to do this?

Is everyone who uses bitcoin rich?

I... I like money.

No one is saying words don't have different connotation depending on how they are used. A word will still have it's base definition, it's original meaning, it only has additional implications on top of that. Otherwise using a word out of context is just speaking improperly, or twisting the definition, which is what they do with words like patriotism in the the article.
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:52:24


I'm sure they will just have companies put backdoors in to everything anyways. You know... Something something patriotism, and such.

That's excellent. But I'm curious, how do you accept bitcoins as a business? Is it just like accepting them from another person, they just bring a phone or laptop in and send it to your address, and that's it?
