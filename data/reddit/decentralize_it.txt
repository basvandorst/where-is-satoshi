Welcome to the new normal.

I'd argue that most people are, in fact, [on the same page](

Happy to see Venezuela killing it once again.

SigWit is a soft fork and therefore doesn't really require nodes to "signal" for it, although I suppose you could assume direct support based on the client's version 
[BU node signaling](

Although block propagation is a bit different between the implementations, the actual blocks are identical (aside from the actual max block size).

I'm a long time Bitcoin supporter and am looking for arguments to support SegWit and am trying to be as objective as possible.
I mean no offense to Tone but if I was coming into this for the first time and using solely this discussion as a basis as to which scaling solution I would support, there would be no hesitation.
Simply saying "They know best" and "I've heard people say this..." immediately kills your credibility and any potential momentum you had in the debate.
Roger does come off as very emotional in this debate but the talking points that Tone used here makes SegWit looks a bit lackluster.

If you want to see an explosion, [check out Venezuela](

Of course.

Support !== preference.

Blockchain != Bitcoin.
**Bitcoin** [continues to lose market share month after month]( as we sit back and let centralized entities dictate the direction of the project.

[This]( is what you're looking for.
@_date: 2016-03-29 00:53:41
We should be doing both. The world doesn't care if our solutions are perfect, they just need to actually exist and, right now, they simply don't.
@_date: 2016-03-29 00:26:01
Just another casualty along the way as Bitcoin's relevance continues to fade.

Here, I bolded the important part for you. He's not wrong. We have been debating this bullshit for well over 2 years now.
And if you think fees are fine and we're 'doing well', you lack perspective.

They just mined 3 BU blocks in a row.
Maybe next time guys. :)

Why? Because that's what you think "feels" right?
I'm not defending them but I think you may underestimate how big they've become [over the past year]( They do a heck of a lot more than just mining.
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:55:59




Those are bold statements. How about some sources?
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:54:43
I don't know about you, but I hear a heck of a lot more coming from Kraken these days than Bitpay.
