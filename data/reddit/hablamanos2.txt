No, what I am talking about is poloniex buying the coins cheap and then making tens of millions of dollars pumping them up. It also increases trade volume so they get more profit.

@_date: 2016-04-03 17:05:57
If you want to make a multimillion dollar transaction in crypto you use bitcoin.
Now build the actual contract using any of the top 50 altcoins and I would be fine with that. 1000 Eur is too low i agree =)
I want something like:
If dogecoin address A sends X dogecoins to address B, send Y bitcoins to bitcoin address C.
And then I imagine you could build 95%+ of all smart contracts using simple logic like this, but I have yet to figure out any smart contracts I actually want to make.

Most bubbles have a lot of similarities between thrm. While we can't say the same asset will bubble, we can say that something will go through a bubble and we can look at previous bubbles as guidance to what will happen.

And back down under 3000 for now...
The good news though is that 3000 CNY is not the same as $500 USD. So we can help the chinese over 3000 and they they can help us over $500, and we won't all be stuck at a psychological barrier all at once.
@_date: 2016-04-17 23:20:09
The bubble was mostly from media attention after we broke the $31 all time high.

@_date: 2016-04-23 00:33:06
Hey guys, do you remember the first time you heard about bitcoin and then brushed it aside until you heard about in the news skyrocketing in price and missing out?
Well, the Nov 2013 bubble brought bitcoins to the publics attention and they brushed it aside just like a lot of you.
Which means that if we do break the $1200 all time high many more people will start to respect bitcoin.
It is just the final iteration of history repeating itself before what I believe to be much stronger adoption. Now if only we knew when btc would hit $1200 again.
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:27:44

From my perspective: I was hoping for Segwit so people could work on second layer solutions and then increase block size as soon as possible to scale on chain as much as possible. If the blocksize was increased first, people would have just argued for increased block size every time we needed to scale and never done anything to enable 2nd layer stuff.
But when we tried to get Segwit, the other "side" wanted the block size to increase first and it stalemated and polarized the community for years. Now we are at the point where such a large % of the people on the Segwit side absolutely hate the idea of increasing the block size.
Eventually we might see someone like Square implement bitcoin payments through an app (similar to venmo) where every transaction is just through a centralized database and none of the transactions are on the blockchain or utilize a decntrlized second layer like LN. This could push bitcoin mainstream even though it goes against so much the bitcoin community stands for. But most people wouldn't care at all and to be honest, at this point i wouldnt care if my every day $5 - $20 transactions were like this. Definitely not ideal, but the bickering is so annoying i would rather it be like this than nothing.

I will suggest doing some research into Paycoin to see what happens when the inflation rate is arbitrarily changed.
Essentially you destroy one of bitcoins best uses cases: as a store of value. Changing this would cause the price of bitcoin to fall fast (Even if it was changed so that no new bitcoins would be mined - once it is changed a precedent is set and all confidence is lost as it can be changed again and again). A substantial decrease in the price destroys the market cap of bitcoin. As a result it becomes more volatile and it becomes worse as a currency due to loss of market depth.
You may think it is in the miners interest to increase the rate of bitcoin production. Well... they may benefit for a couple days if they look at daily revenue because they have more coins to sell... but the effects on the price will be quick and severe. They will never recoup the cost of purchasing the mining equipment.
You may think a government would have an incentive to corrupt bitcoin by proposing such a change. But then we may all switch to an alt such as Dash which is much more anonymous and would put them further behind controlling the darknet. By the time bitcoin is large eneough as to where governments are worried it is sucking in too much wealth, governments will likely own large amounts of bitcoin they would rather not want to devalue.
If a change to the bitcoin inflation schedule is suspected to massively improve bitcoin, it would be better to create an alt that has your desired inflation schedule. Surely a much better virtual currency would replace bitcoin - but it seems like this has proven futile as the alt coin graveyard demonstrates. No other inflation schedule is significantly better than bitcoins to the point where we are all abandoning bitcoin. The most important characteristic of bitcoins inflation schedule is that it is assumed to be set in stone. The next important is that it is on a long enough timeframe so that people who are not necessarily early adopters can benefit from the influx of new coins either through mining or through lower prices from the miners selling, but short enough so that there is a strong incentive to accumulate sooner rather than later (read never).
Perhaps this is the most important piece of bitcoins value proposition: Nobody has an incentive to change the 21 million cap.

According to who exactly?
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:42:14
A fairly bullish argument:
In 2015 1.3 million bitcoins will be mined in total, and the price is still higher at the end of the year even though miners probably dumped most of them.
If the market can absorb 1.3 million bitcoins in 1 year, and only 6 million more bitcoins will be mined ever, we do not need to worry about miners pushing the price down at these price levels.

It is funny, but up until about 2 weeks before we hit $1000 everyone was screaming "Omg we are going to $1000". Then when we got close they just added a 0 to make it $10k, and I am sure if we ever get near to $10k people will move the target to $100k.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:44:09
Some people can't get over the fact that with all of their experience, their education, etc, etc, etc   they missed out on super cheap bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-11-15 22:31:00
There are already markets for this, and I am sure some of the "sellers" would take bitcoin.

Okay well you got me there... start messing with the block reward and turn bitcoin into paycoin. That will force bitcoin to drop forever, and quite quickly to under $50.

What I think would be cool is for a bitcoin merchant processor to hire a bitcoin trader/investor who can decide to hold or sell bitcoins when a transaction is made. Perhaps most of the time the default will just be to sell, but during the times when it is a really good idea to hold some in bitcoin for the short term, the merchant processor company could make some money, and then translate those profits into discounts for the consumer.

I bought some shares in lending club. As long as the global market does not collapse, I imagine it could do very well. Similar to how 3d printing became "all the rage" and DDD skyrocketed, p2p lending could go through a phase of its own, and lending club is the market leader.
I have owned notes on lending club for about 1.5 years and have been very happy with my returns so far.

Cryptocurrency: got to love it, got to hate it, and you damn well better be on the top of your game! 1000 people losing $10 in a pump and dump makes these people believe they are Gods, and they will continue to spread their religion of deceit. They will eventually miss out on a big rally in bitcoin, or something else, and realize their time is better spent just riding the waves =)
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:04:36
In short, yes they could.
But as we saw with the guy who sold 30k for $300 each, if you sell at the wrong time it is excrutiatingly difficult to rebuy them all back at a lower price.
Another way to think about it: If you want to manipulate bitcoins price you need to buy some first; short selling is just too risky with large amounts of coins.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:38:04
Here is some stuff I have noticed that you can look at:
Google search volume skyrockets upon bitcoin price reaching a new all time high, which leads to a bubble.
Altcoins follow, with the coins with highest market cap rising first, then shortly after the lower market cap ones rise an even higher % but all from speculation.
You will probably need to consider merchant adoption and the effect of new mined coins which still makes bitcoin inflation rate around 10%. Miners selling have s much larger negative impact on prices than do merchants immediately cashing out.
Also please remember many price changes are supposedly caused by something, such as Cyprus or China or whatever, keep in mind a lot of these reasons were only made to explain the price changes and they caught on, whereas pure speculation is a much better explanation.
Good luck!
@_date: 2014-11-16 07:18:45
It is very funny to me how people do not buy "because the price is too high and is obviously in a bubble" or do not buy because "the price has fallen so much it was obviously a scam to begin with, and deserves to be cheap"
Can anyone think for themselves? Or is it just borderline impossible to escape the herd mentality of speculative bubbles?
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:04:11
I really do not understand why people get hung up on the number of satoshis - the important thing is that it is divisible eneough to send any reasonable amount of value. Who cares if its divisible to 8, 20, or 100 places? There is no excess or undersupply, as long as there are enough of the basic unit, it is good. The smallest unit needs to be almost worthless in order for any arbitrary value to be sent.

Back when I started with bitcoin that number for me was $100. Then it hit $100 and everyone cried ponzi, it hit $1000 and everyone was like "wtf", now it is at $370 and most people think it died lol
Ill tell them "I told you so" again at $2k, although the next bubble would bring us to $3k-$5k, then everyone will claim it is dead again if it falls back to like $2500.

Because I will sell you a bitcoin for $99,999,999.99, and if nobody buys because I am not part of "your group" it is obvious it is fake. If you did buy, I would arbitrage the entire market until you ran out of money or the price rose to $100M, in which cash you should have just bought on the exchanges in the first place.

An easily accessible ETF would do it for sure, but keep in mind you do not need an inflow of $50 billion to raise the market cap by $50 billion. Just like you do not need $13m dollars to raise the market cap by $13 million (IE buying enough bitcoin to raise the price $1).

In a scenario where bitcoin bubbles again, I could see GBTC spiking massively as people pile in with there $ in brokerage accounts and it may be hard for new shares to be issued quick enough.

My idea a while back was letting people "lock" an online account with bitcoin. Essentially the only way to log in to an account is to spend a bitcoin address down to 0... if the balance of the bitcoin address is 0 you can log in using your password/2fa or whatever. If it's above zero you cannot gain access to the account for any reason. 
I have a few accounts where I would like to lock for a while just to be sure nobody can access them even if they found all my info and password somewhere.

That moment when immortality is invented but it only works if you are under the age of *INSERT YOUR AGE HERE*. Just think about that for a moment.. everyone younger than you is immortal but you are not... what do you do?
Also, no matter what the human lifespan can be extended to most people will have to work to within 5-10 years of death (on average, or when the average person cannot function well at a job) It's not like you will work for 40 years and spend the next 200 years having a great time. Its more like everyone is required ("forced" into) working as an unpaid intern 50 years, as a fast food worker for 50 years etc.. Also average real rates of return would become much lower.
if you don't believe me think about the reverse case: what if the human lifespan was only 15 years long? You may say "well i wouldnt worry about school/work I would just have fun", but wouldn't that be the same attitude someone expecting to live until 250 would have if they were told they were only able to live for 80?

Here is my opinion:
The argument is not whether or not a deflationary currency like bitcoin is "good" or "bad". 
The argument is that bitcoin was inevitable and is unstoppable. Its deflationary tendency means that in the long run it should hold value better than all other currencies, and as a result, hedging your financial position by buying a small amount of bitcoin is smart, whether or not you like bitcoin or don't and whether or not you think it is good or bad.

The funny part is that the gold price is actually a double top at like 1900 if you adjust it for inflation. However, you can clearly tell the second rise in gold sped up dramatically once it passed the old all time high (nominally)
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:52:37
Litecoin spikes up in price after bitcoin rallies hard. Traders feel much richer, have 50-100% gains in a month, and are willing to speculate on alts, starting with litecoin.
The litecoins rise in price, people ask why it is rising in price, and then some rumour comes out such as "ltc on gox" and the rise in price of litecoins is attributed to this rumour. Keep in mind a rumour will always be found!
The drastic fall in prices is because the rise was almost purely speculative, which isnt necessary bad, but turns bad for the price when people get tired of losing money. It will drop until long term speculators can hoard most of them with cash they can affod to lose.
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:54:02

I bought one (redeemed 25 BTC coin) a couple years ago for a few hundred dollars. I forget if it was $300 or $400?
But i figure if there are only a couple hundred of these in circulation, it was a good collectors item. I have yet to see one for sale since then, although i haven't looked recently.
Were 25 BTC blanks ever sold like they were for the 5 BTC variation? Is that what you mean when you say it never had a sticker on it... or did you get it after it had been redeemed?
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:39:27
Don't worry about the buttcoin trolls... they salivate over their assumed "inevitability" of making a 100% return shorting bitcoins to zero.
And when they try to close positions to open larger, more highly levereged positions to make more than 100%, they get short squeezed.
With that being said I imagine bitcoin has more to drop - the best case scenario for a short term bounce right now is to 290-300, not something I am eager chase.

No you are wrong: As you see in the chart, bitcoin fell from $31 down to $2. As it recovered from $2 to $31 there was absolutely no media attention or interest at all. It wasn't until it hit a new all time high of $31 that anybody cared about bitcoin again. Then everyone who learned about bitcoin as it rallied to $31 and blew it off realized they were wrong and some of them decided to buy.

Okay, from looking at the thread absolutely everyone had to know this was a ponzi....
and yet still at one point over 30k btc were "invested" hoping to gain money from later people.
I have been studying some literature by economists on the psychology of bubbles and how the start, etc.. but all this literature assumes people are orders of magnitude more rational than what happened here.
Edit: was more like 500 not 30k, misread some posts/ read manipulative posts. My mistake

It is a mixture of both, but I know when fees are lifted for a week people are much more likely to sell and rebuy cheaper later, especially if they think everyone else will do the same.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:44:21
Well I guess you have no explanation for why it has been worth something greater than zero for 5-6 years.
Try to come up with something other than "because bitcoiners are stupid", because some of us have actually MADE money as its market cap increased from $0 to $4 billion.
Perhaps at this point bitcoin is only supported by buttcoiners losses, but I will try to be optimistic than that, although it gives a lower bound on the price.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:54:32
Except that it is different people each time. If you think about it, every time a trade is made someone is calling a bottom the same time someone else is calling a top.

Do not let these trolls get to you; They come in two types:
1) They got massively burned by bitcoin and assume that since they were not smart eneough to make money that it is a ponzi scheme.
2) They actively short bitcoin and spread their fud/hatred to get people to sell so they make money.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:20:26

@_date: 2015-01-27 04:07:32
As long as bitcoin is being actively used this will lead to an increase in the price of the coins still in circulation. A lot of bitcoins are already presumed gone because of this but bitcoin will continue functioning fine since it is highly divisible.

@_date: 2015-01-16 20:40:58
Just a hunch. We could look at numbers such as 70% of bitcoin have not moved in 6 months, look at the market depth and assume only 10% is shown on the books, create a model looking at the psychological aspects of the market, look at how news stories and google trends search volume for "bitcoin" relate, guess at an average time frame for bitcoin bubbles, etc etc etc.
But i prefer to cut to the chase and just say $300 - $500 million. The question is.. do you think I am too far off? =)
It is also a hypothesis of mine that rising the market cap by $X can be caused by 5% of that increase in market cap from money actually buying, whereas the remaining 95% comes from people just holding. If you are holding bitcoins you are not putting more money in when the price rises.
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:54:01
Guess there are some people who really should have bought btc.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:39:14
I heard about bitcoin during the 2011 bubble, then waited until the price bottomed in dec/jan of 2012 before buying in at $5 each. Unfortunately someone hacked all of my accounts, everywhere on the internet, a little while later. They apparently did not know what bitcoin was so did not take them, but I got paranoid and sold 80% of them. (I am an idiot and did not know about cold storage back then =Z)
Anyway, I sold the ones I kept at $220 each, re-bought at $130-$150 each, resold over $1000 each. Also bought litecoins at 15 cents each, sold at $4.00 each, re-bought for $10 each and sold those for $25-35 each.
I have mainly been holding cash the last year trying to find the bottom, but i recognize the 3600 coins mined per day puts us in a natural downtrend. I have come to believe that the long 4 year halvings were meant to keep the price in check and give people multiple opportunities to buy (but apparently only people who really believe in bitcoin)
And to everyone who thinks bitcoin is dead/will die... well thank you for repeatedly allowing me to buy cheap crypto right before bubbles/adoption waves =)

I believe you could withdraw bitcoins for months after USD withdrawals stopped being processes. Well, maybe not if you had 1000+ coins.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:25:29
It could have definitely been a contributing factor to the start of the bubble in 2013.
The largest factor, however, was the media in the rise from 30 to 250 in early 2013.
Gox + the media fueled the rise to $1000. Some people think Gox blatantly manipulated the price by buying coins with fake $'s. However, starting a couple months before the rise to $1000 it became impossible to withdraw $ from Gox, and so the price was held up by people buying coins on Gox to sell elsewhere... until it hit a new all time high of $270 and the media hype took over again.
@_date: 2016-03-31 00:09:28
So if the price rallies to $10k per coin in about 5 months after the halvening, would you think the halvening had any impact?

@_date: 2016-03-26 22:37:49
I'm sure i do not have the entire story.
However, I believe that if Gox did not have the USD withdrawal problems the bubble to $270 would have deflated similar to how the bubble of 2011 to $31 deflated and to how the bubble of 2013 to $1000 deflated.
Of course, the price may have ended up a lot higher now because we would not have lost so many enthusiastic people to the Gox fiasco and bitcoin would not have been cast in such a negative light afterwards.

If this sticks in your memory so much you probably got involved in bitcoin in late 2013.
The "crazy" people were predicting $1000 bitcoins, but as soon as we got close a new group of people came in with their $10k predictions (which lasted for like a month) and the first group was forgotten.
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:02:35
I would like a nice consolidation somewhere between $1000 and the ATH. Once we pass the ATH the media will hype it up so it always ends up in a huge spike.

I have never heard anything good about teamviewer.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:55:49
not when common sense suffices
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:02:03
must be missing out on the rally lol
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:26:45
Have you ever used a smart contract? just curious...
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:32:38
I'm at a hostel now. going to buy a shot for everyone at the bar if this gets approved tonight.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:09:02
check your math... should be more like $60k per ounce.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:09:51
I expect you'll get it. I have been in similar situations before.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:25:20
Okay I definitely like decentralized markets.... going to be trading this stuff forever i guess :)
@_date: 2016-03-27 19:57:09
Yeah this is kind of funny, but we are trying to break above the downtrend line starting at $500 and this may have done it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:51:35
Different people create drama for different reasons. Some of it yes... but not all of it.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:18:05
I don't see Luke Jr as a troll; he is more like a devils advocate.
@_date: 2016-01-24 21:23:41
Could have made the same argument years ago.
@_date: 2016-01-05 00:50:47
The amount of cash stays the same... But the value of the assets goes down. Just like if you sold $1 billion of bitcoin using a market order the market cap of bitcoin would drop more than $1 billion.
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:17:06
Yes go with Sunday Eastern time... my best guess from trading this stuff for 4 years now lol.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:24:00
Oh no, the grammar Nazis! Lol
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:31:51
I see thank you! 
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:00:04
There was this one: 
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:57:26
I find it very hard to believe the upside potential for gold is huge when its market cap is $5 -$10 trillion. To me gold looks like its in a 10+ year downtrend.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:28:07
Even better: use GOX USD to prop the price up.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:01:27
The "bubbles" come when everyone else realizes the exact same thing all at the exact same time. (Although not using as technical of terms lol)
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:53:15
low market caps makes them easy to pump and dump
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:59:28
I want intergalactic currency....
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:16:03
same can be said for any asset...
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:15:11
honestly i have no idea haha.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:21:16
Lol, same story here.... For 5 years :/
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:01:50
better I it was based on how long you have been involved with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:56:41
Yeah and I bet it is has a back door ;)
@_date: 2016-03-31 00:11:43
It was the media hype, not Cyprus.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:24:08
alts always do good after btc goes up... look at 2013
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:17:21
Running out of people on the bottom of the pyramid?
Lol there is a guy sitting on a boat with a laptop "making money from bitcoin"
If that doesn't clue you in, nothing does. Why is there always a guy on a boat or driving an expensive car in every pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:12:05
Think of all the people who sold out under $10 and want a second chance...
And all the people who bought at under $10 who want to make another fortune.
Really the only thing that could make bitcoin fall that low again would be if there was a fork and the number of bitcoins coming into circulation changed, which is extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:15:37
Would be nice if he told us a specific date as to when bitcoin will spiral down to near worthlessness....
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:41:59
if you are willing to buy $70k of bitcoins for $75k... I would be wondering why you can't just use an exchange. i would be worried that as soon as i deposit the $75k in a bank, I'll go to jailnfor money laundering.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:46:46
umm, fairies?
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:30:48
If it hits $1000 it should go a lot higher.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:07:48
The comments in this thread are a much more bullish indicator than the chart. It seems that the smart money is holding most of the bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-04 19:38:30
If it were to go up and hit a new all time high, causing a media fueled bubble, I would make a fortune with alts =)
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:35:49
The DAO pumped eth in May. Imagine we collectively decided to buy 10% of all bitcoins in existence and throw them in cold storage. Same thing happened there.
@_date: 2016-06-07 00:42:33
If we hit a new all time high the media would hype it just like in 2013.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:46:38
1% of the population is not in that graph... More like 0.5%.
Less than 1% of the world are millionaires.
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:27:56
Nah, we are just in the matrix and we are realizing that everyones brain is wired the same way.
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:29:12
Too late haha
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:23:18
Noob IMF pumping is pumping a ponzi scheme lol.
Just kidding of course
@_date: 2016-06-29 06:50:16
Some girl in college asked me why I didnt tell her about bitcoins when they were $5 each...
Umm... because I had a crush on you and didn't want to come off as a super-nerd.
My nerdy friends I did mention bitcoin to thought I was just peddling a ponzi scheme.
Can't do anything right ='(
Anyway, awesome!
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:45:32
Well we can always find a random alt that does even better, considering there are like 1000 of them.
@_date: 2016-06-07 01:19:05
Learned about it in the 2011 bubble, and yes I do trade bro, but a lot less than most traders.
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:47:30
Yeah it's so hard to tell =\
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:31:47
Yeah... It was over $1000 for what, like a day or two?
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:54:37
My mistake: bought $2k worth of bitcoin, then when it was all worth $2400, I sold $2000 worth and kept the $400 invested. (Bitcoin was $10 each)
The $400 (through trading and the bubbles) is now worth a little over $100k...but I wish I would have kept all $2400 in play so I would be closer to $1 million haha.
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:10:09
Damn, who made a random alt and named it "bitxoin". Fell for that scam.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:06:36
Why can't me holding bitcoins be considered "using" them? Stop telling me what to do with my bitcoins haha.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:26:01
Based on how weak that last pullback was and how quickly we consolidated, we probably have a ways to go up =)
Just my opinion though.
@_date: 2016-06-08 00:26:16
Idk why you guys can't just take a chill pill. This doomsday death spiral that a lot of people have been circulating needs to end. Thank god its o ly another montb.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:50:17
less money to the government lol
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:15:49
I've been trying to think of something to type for 5 minutes but i give up =\
Basically we need such a huge speculative rise in value and a subsequent pullback that a top looks obvious. Kind of like the $500 top last Fall.... But we recovered from that fairly quickly. I'm surprised we haven't really had much of a pullback after the rise from $500, but I do not think a pullback now at this price level would derail the rally.
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:39:13
Well the actual physical buying of the ETH to send to the DAO had to push it up a lot.
@_date: 2016-06-20 00:48:40
But if bitcoin has no mass, where do we get the energy from?
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:43:54
Agreed in the sense that Berkshire Hathaway could be trading at $1 tomorrow as well :)
At any second a rich person may sell me something valuable for $1.
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:55:37
Idk if its the case here, but the only times I have ever really hears about team viewer has been from people getting hacked with it. I will never trust any computer that has it installed.
@_date: 2016-06-06 04:37:02
In am going to create my own exchange where in trade all my bitcoins back and forth with myself as fast as possible. I will have 99% of the volume.
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:23:45
Lol, k
@_date: 2016-06-20 00:47:25
Are you trying to say the momentum of the price rise is about to accelerate?
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:33:01
Played mmorpgs too much and saw the value in virtual goods.
Saw bitcoin and I'm like "Yep that will be the best investment of my life", and I was right haha
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:39:32
To me it looks like he is trying to make a comeback of sorts, or something.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:03:41
Yeah, this is all that most people care about, which is why if we end up passing the ath, we will enter another bubble.
And then, as always, we will have between that moment and the top of the bubble to explain bitcoin to people where they will actually listen.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:01:00
Lol, you would end up losing a lot fairly quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:18:09


haven't heard of that alt before but, uhh.... yeah i guess?
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:29:00
Survived crash from $1200 to $170.
Bitcoin falls from $720 to $680. Must be dead.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:47:24
Yeah true, it is a very good article.
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:27:08
I told myself in early 2014 that the price crossing 700 would mean a new all time high is extremely likely. So no profit taking for me at this level... I need to trust in myself haha
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:13:44
It has to break the old all time high before the bubble even begins.
@_date: 2016-06-25 20:08:51
And how many people are using that? Nobody besides speculators trying to get rich off the promise of trading fees, something crypto is trying to get rid of.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:43:47
must be a lot of new traders panicking... i sold some on btc-e for 690 and rebought the same amount for 665 on coinbase.
Thanks for that guys &lt;3
we were overdue for some kind of a correction, but since i got my recent stack at 430 i havent bothered cashing out.
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:41:09
It only legitimizes bitcoin. However, we do not want bitcoin "backed" by fiat/gold/whatever.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:44:58
If this is true, they would know that hitting a new all time high would start another huge speculative bubble and they would make bank.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:13:47
Sorry, we are still such a tiny community. If you did not receive that kind of reaction, bitcoin would already be at least 10X higher.
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:56:36
Yeah hopefully we get back there someday :)
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:52:03
The dangers of better against bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:23:33
Idk... We took 6 months to consolidate at 450 before moving up.

Trump because I won't be voting for she who must not be named.
@_date: 2016-06-04 05:30:34
i dont think we will see $200 again.
Edit: Clearly I am having too much fun with all my alt accounts. And **you** just got trolled.
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:40:26
Well im sure sure your up handsomly on your shorts if you can predict it so well =)
Just make sure to cover before everyone else, probably right about now.
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:26:17
is it bearwhale?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:14:24
You should not be investing your down payment for a house in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:54:23
All bitcoiners are the Illuminati. In 1000 years we will hear stories of people passing down hundreds of bitcoins over the centuries.. The value of which will be unthinkable by then.
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:36:33
Noe the question is... If you know a bubble is coming, do you sell out?
No, you always try to sell the top :)
Besides, "adoption wave" sounds better than "bubble"
Also, I just remembered I forgot to tell some friends.to buy before the last rally. Sorry guys :(
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:05:25
If you ever did any research into the tulip bulb bubble, you would.realize that the most expensive tulips back then are now extinct. So I don't think you have any :)
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:47:13
Damn... Okay guys you caught me!! I downloaded a location spoofer app and set my country to "North Korea" so that I could bet $1 on a flappy bird knockoff called "coin flapper". I guess I was not " free" enough to do this in the "land of the free".
I'll be tying my own noose, no need to come arrest me.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:51:32
Wasn't a bubble... Just everyone on the sidelines deciding to buy in all at once. Next bubble would start if we hit a new all time high.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:28:01
yeah... idk who bought my coins for 690 there... but thanks =)
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:38:22
It is also people shorting with high leverage to take advantage of the bad news, and spreading as much FUD as they can.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:49:08
how about big in permanent marker, then fill in the rest with erasable marker to make it seem like it spells something else.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:22:46
ill take out a mortgage and buy 100,000 btc at $3.5 each
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:08:15
I have made $100k+ from bitcoin, but I started investing with only about 1% of my net worth.
I guess I should have bumped that up to 10%...which would have only been $4k when I was a teenager
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:47:11
I will never permanently sell all.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:12:20
I have a standing offer to buy every bitcoin in existence for $1.
Therefore bitcoin will never go to $0.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:28:46
Even if so, the supply is halving in a month anyway ;)
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:43:20
You will not give me 0.1 btc for free within the next week, which means the price has not fallen to zero.
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:36:40
While I agree, I also want it to be the best currency it can possibly be at the same time.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:31:42
i hope they got most of the conspiracy theorists
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:20:23
i get the same problem using google trends now =\
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:16:07
Nice collection. Have you come across anyone selling redeemed 10 or 25 btc coins?
@_date: 2016-06-08 00:29:03
Because they think they are the first person in the world who has ever thought of such a scenario. They should fl look at litecoins halvening... It survived just fine.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:10:42
A positive sentiment building over the last week... and everyone decides to trade at the exact same time.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:35:45
np :)
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:39:38
He and i agree that $700 was pretty much the last psychological barrier before a new ath. pray that we are correct. i made this prediction based on the bulltrap in 2014 not breaking $700.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:21:08
And thus bitcoin erotica was born.
Now we need a femdom story with Karpelas and the "Bitcoin Girl". Bonus points if Vitalik Buterin writes a smart contract to add a plot twist.
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:59:16
Yes, I uses to play mmorpgs where I would be invested in /trade over 10% of the entire supply of certain items. It is very hard to accumulate and then sell off such a position. If you try to buy/sell too fast you just cause the market to spike and as soon as you stop it trends back the other way.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:10:03
Patience haha
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:47:49
what am i looking at?
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:05:54
$9 million versus $30 million.
You know, i could live with either =)
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:12:43
You should receive the 0.21.
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:31:42
If bitcoin rocketed to $1500, there are plenty of alts which will X10 for the speculators.

@_date: 2017-01-23 03:27:09
I think I agree with you now if you can bu right.

Yeah this one should recover.

The dog says HODL
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:46:32
I am just going to call it another in a long line of scams.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:16:01
Nope, we are much earlier in the bubble cycle than when we hit $1000 last time.
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:12:24

@_date: 2016-06-25 17:05:33
Prices are way too high.

Lol this gets old.
@_date: 2016-06-19 05:22:43
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:14:34
We are getting more media attention now, but if we get an all time high the media will hype it like crazy.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:40:27
people taking the news and then using 20X to short the market as much as possible, then spread as much fear as possible.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:48:54
There are much easier ways to churn than this.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:47:11
Higher price --&gt; media attention --&gt; more buyers --&gt; higher price.
Its a loop.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:21:58
Its better when you casually.mention bitcoin to a couple of them every once in a while, then randomly quit to go travel the world for a year.
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:09:04

I don't think China is as much of a dictatorship as most people assume. They (Chinese government) want China to be on the cutting edge in as many industries as possible to compete with the rest of the world.

10 btc... $9k... is like what? 10 years working at min wage?
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:19:14

if you really needed to cash out fast you could probably use a few different exchanges at once... i dont think you would have any problems unless it is really high, like $10m+. even then you could probably do it in a few months
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:00:08
More than just a few hundred. Plus traders know this and front run the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:09:00
If necessary I think we can make it even more highly divisible.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:04:17
You can also raise the limit more if you send them an email, i believe

(total $ in - total $ out)/(# of coins currently owned)
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:49:58
Lol, if I ever bought into ETH they would probably hardfork to 100% annual inflation.
@_date: 2016-06-23 05:57:16
Lol. I remember wanting to buy 1000 bitcoins at $2 each, and then settling to buy 40 at $5 each.
Should have caughed up a few more k to get the full 1000 I wanted haha
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:33:40
Look into a Roth IRA conversion ladder.

Bitcoin has this interesting dynamic where we are supposed to store it in cold storage .... but this makes it much less likely to sell it than if we had kept it on an exchange.

@_date: 2016-12-09 19:55:03
This is the media and the general population. The general population will only listen after bitcoin breaks a new all time.high ams before the following media induced bubble ends. That typically gives us about 3 months where people will actually think about it.
Fortunately, most people understand bitcoin the second time they see one of these bubbles. A lot of people who wrote it off in 2011 came to our side in 2013. A large percentage of the population heard about bitcoin in 2013, and so now they will all hear about it again.

I made a couple trades on the rebounds, but I refused to short sell even when it was obvious.
If we manage to break $1200, I can see it going to $3k - $5k, maybe more. But my exit will be based on psychological factors, not just the nominal price.
I also plan on catching some alt bubbles like 2013. Actually made most my money in 2013 by buying litecoins at $0.14.

Good, so I buy them and put them in cold storage immediately = no capital gains.
If the price then doubles and I move them back... well my cost basis is going to have to be the moment they re-entered the exchange so when I sell I still have no capital gains.
Is everyone clueless? They would not do this lol

@_date: 2016-12-21 00:42:01
Arize chikun!
@_date: 2016-12-18 21:04:51
Okay that's a lot of questions....
1: The bitcoins price spiked extramely rapidly twice in 2013 due to enormous media hype. It was inevitable for it to crash back down, and then when it came out that the largest exchange at the time (MT. Gox) was insolvent, and all the bitcoins lost, confidence was shattered. Many people think either Gox directly manipulated the price up through a "Willy bot" (this is debatable) or Indirectly manipulated it up (the price on mtgox was measured in goxUSD that was impossible to withdraw so a premium existed that many amateurs tries to arbitrage. This led to a positive feedback loop when combined with media hype forced the price up).
2: Alt coins like Ltc and Eth typically rise a lot  when bitcoin is in a bubble because speculators take bitcoin trading profits and buy alts hoping for a quick X10... Which eventually happens. If bitcoin hits a new all time high, it is likely that speculators will push **ALL** alts up 5x to 50x current prices. Until that point, they will tend to just bleed out for months before they apike over 1/or 2 weeks. They will mostly all crash back down.
3: it is very unlikely we will have a 70-80% drawdown without a major bubble to $5k+. All of the extremely large drawdowns have occured after these massive rallies. So if the price is up 100-200% in a month, it is probably a good time to sell.
4: Governments may create their own cryptocurrencies but they will never completely fix the supply distribution as with bitcoin. They need to have some control (monetary policy) to attempt to control the economy. Government using cryptocurrencies will put faith in the blockchain technology and make people used to having their wealth stored in a digital currency and making transactions with it, which can only be good for bitcoin. Governments do not like currencies that can lead to deflationary spirals.. It is just bad economics. But can you really use the argument: "Bitcoin is bad and its price will collapse simply because it is bad for a currency to go up in price!" Absolutely not.
5: Bitcoin is essentially "digital gold" because it is scarce. (21M coin limit). The existence of a multi billion dollar industry surrounding in game MMORPG items traded on grey markets is evidence that bitcoin is undervalued. The ability to hold bitcoin out of reach of anyone makes bitcoin seem extremely undervalued when you compare it to the tens of trillions of dollars held in tax havens throughout the world, and the tens of trillions of dollars held as M1 currency which must inevitably lose value to inflation.

why not just sell on an exchange?
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:00:38
The last 6 blocks  have transaction fees of 0.2 - 0.3 btc per block.
Lets just say this is $50.
The question is could bitcoin survive if each block was only worth $50. The answer is yes... bitcoin was under $1 for about 2 years which was a $50 block reward.
But then you may ask: But a 50% attack would be so easy, wouldn't it be insecure?... and I would kindly ask you to conduct a  50% attack on any alt with a block reward of $50. I highly doubt the block reward will drop this low, but even if it did, i wouldn't be too worried.
We should wait at least 20 years before even thinking about increasing the block reward... and those who do should be required to take a remedial bitcoin class =)

A lot of people liken it to digital gold, and with $20 - $30 trillion worth of value currently hidden in tax havens around the globe, there is massive demand for an asset you can hold without permission from anyone and which cannot be shut down.

Please start mining paycoins if you want to arbitrarily change the block reward to get rich quick.
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:11:05
Using bitcoin as a long term store of value becomes out of the question if the block reward is arbitrarily changed.
.. And then bitcoin lost it's best use case.

In markets such as bitcoin, double the supply of something and the price will fall more than 50%.
Something like a stock split may have a small affect but there is no point with bitcoin since it is already divisible enough.

You can bash any asset in a downtrend using the worst arguments and all dissenting opinions will be ignored.
But then when the trend goes the other way the situation is flip-flopped.
I feel bad for the people bullish on gold though... it could be in a very long term downtrend.

The downtrend in gold can be very long... like 20 years. It is not worthless but does not go up year over year forever. I would be surprised if gold does not touch $650 in the next decade. I would not be surprised if we needed to wait upwards of 25 years+ to see gold at $2000 in 2015 dollars again. 
Believe me or not but it seems like golds price trend is 10X as long as bitcoins in general.... ie less volatile.

Basically his argument is that because bitcoin is deflationary (will continue going up as he implies in his article) it is doomed and should go down.  
So because something *should* go up in price over time it is bad and will not work.
Second I do not see any divide between early/late adopters... as everyone draws the line at a different place. Some people would say early adopters were only in the first 3-6 months of bitcoins existence, others say under $X dollar value, many people say we are still early adopters. 
The divide between using bitcoin as a currency and store of value... it is perfectly fine to use it as both. Just because there are multiple uses for bitcoin does not mean the community is being torn apart over a non-existant debate.
Come back with better arguments please.

A while ago someone used to make a nice image showing what % of bitcoin have been held (have not moved) for a specific amount of time.

For those interested here is the thread that got me interested in bitcoins:
sythe does the same thing as OPSkins apparently, the "craigslist of virtual goods".
Read the first page of that thread to read the arguments for and against bitcoin. Same exact arguments five years later and you wonder why I am am going crazy when nobody against bitcoin can come up with an original argument. It looks like a good portion (30-50%) of the traders their use bitcoins.
Edit: I believe you should read more than just the first page. These are all pretty smart people who were already making money trading virtual currencies before bitcoin even came out.

Perhaps it was only over $1000 because for a while people could not withdraw dollars from gox but could withdraw bitcoins. So people were willing to buy higher on gox and sell elsewhere.
But other people, especially the media and new traders saw the price on gox going up so they bought in on other exchanges pishing the price up everywhere. Now the people on Gox would be willing to.pay even more to get out. So it was a positive feedback loop which necessarily had to.end when the bitcoins ran out.

In 2009/2010 every single person in the world had the opportunity of putting $10 into bitcoin which would have then turned into $100k in 2013.
I would not call them "stupid" per se... its just that most of them never heard about bitcoin or did not see possibility of it rising X10,000. The people who did hear about it mostly ignored it.
Wouldn't you say it is odd that there was an investment which went up X10,000 and you had **2 years** to buy in? There are millions of high level professionals, millions of super smart people on the earth, but they all let this opportunity stay open for **2 years**? Think about that.
I have interpreted it as people having an absolutely terrible intuitive sense of probability. This is only a minuscule fraction of what makes someone "smart"; enough so that it can be overlooked.

@_date: 2015-04-19 20:35:04
It is more like everyone realized the "good odds" all at once... and by the time they bought the odds had shifted massively against them and they were still thinking about the original odds. Again because they have a bad intuitive sense of probabilities. The "moon" so to speak, shifted from $100 to $1,000 and then to $10,000, the latter shift being my sell signal. My sell signal for litecoins is when there are a lot of people claiming it will hit 0.25 btc, for the same reasons.
edit: in 2009/2010 bitcoin had a positive expected return. More like getting the number 17 on roulette would pay out X500 and anything else was a 100% loss. Originally nobody is willing to gamble because they have a 95%+ chance of losing... but as soon as they realize the positive expected value they all put in what they can afford to lose.
The first step is realizing when something has these "good odds". the harder part is determining what events will force people to realize the odds are good and cause the price to rally.
edit 2: Another example is the Chinese SSE Composite index in the last year. From 2012 through 2014 it fell very slowly from 2500 to 2000, then all of a sudden it surges from 2000 to 4300 in about 8 months. The dollars rally is another example. Everyone sees the good odds all at once and their inability to intuitively sense the odds changing fuels a very nice rally.
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:47:51

Everyone knows how much a 30 year bond will be worth in 30 years **In terms of dollars**. Nobody knows how much $1 will be worth in 30 years or how much you can sell the 30 year bond for in the future.
You can buy a 30 year bond today. but if inflation is higher in like 10 years you will have to take a massive loss if you want to sell the bond. If you hold to maturity... yes you get exactly what you were promised, but the purchasing power could potentially be worth much less.
Invest in dollars over 30 year bonds please! The risk/reward calculation, especially for 30 year bonds, is being improperly calculated if you are an individual who thinks they make for a good investment. Unless of course you expect a decades long deflationary period.

@_date: 2015-04-15 01:02:44
There was no compelling reason to believe it would rise substantially in the first place.
The fact that it did is compelling reason enough to believe it will again. In fact the perceived probability is higher now since we saw that it rose dramatically 3 times already. The larger the crash the larger the potential future profits and speculators do not ignore that potential.
If need be people will wait years for, let's say, a x5 rally
 It doesn't matter to the speculatots if it rises from $1 to $5 or if it was from $1000 to $5000. There is support - much more now than in 2009 and 2010 because of all the profits the early adopters are tempted to put back in if it drops too far.

The volatility right now is much much lower than the first time we hit $250 in april 2013.
I will say that volatility drops off much slower that most people think though. The best case scenario for bitcoin is to have the volatility of gold, which is still rather high.

I think some people have been able to get erroneous fees back from the pool that mines the block... I would try contacting whichever pool ends up mining it.
Good luck
Edit: I think that the pool that mined it is AntPool which it looks like is associated with bitmain. I have never done any mining but I think bitmain is very reputable.. try to contact their support:

So the cheaper bitcoin is the worse it is at being a store of value.

If bitcoin were to hit another all time high,  speculation will drive all alts insanely high as happened in 2013. Legendary profits for the people who bought correctly.
So much potential, in fact,  that if you call yourself a speculator and you are not considering the possibility of another huge already coin bubble fueld by bitcoin bubble profits, we you are a bad speculator.  Traders on Wall Street or anywhere are dumb if they so not see it. 
Now we need a new all time high for another bubble.  If we can consolidat above 700, for let's say a month...  In my opinion that would almost guaranteewe would hit a new all time high.

Maybe paid trolls? What do they have to be so angry about? They either made a bunch on bitcoin or they really hated transaction fees, went to an alt, and made a fortune there.
Maybe some of them are heavily invested in alts and spread stuff like this just to attack bitcoin in the hopes that bitcoin going down will make their alts go up. That is the only conclusion i can come to.
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:26:05
Bitcoin was not designed to solve wealth inequality - it just creates new winners and losers. I believe the benefits vastly outweigh the negatives though. In my opinion the best use of bitcoin is to avoid hyperinflation - as it becomes easier and easier to buy bitcoin it becomes incredibly hard to stop people from buying bitcoins if they really want them. Especially once almost everyone has a phone and internet access.

Because most bitcoin miners do not want to switch to paycoin mining. Bitcoins best use case, as a store of value, is destroyed when what you are suggesting happens and bitcoin would truly be "dead". We would need to use a different coin with a permanent cap, and if bitcoins cap were to change, any coins cap can change.
Please go mine paycoin if you want to arbitrarily dictate the supply of new coins to become " rich"

How does Warren Buffet overseeing $300 billion in investments have any effect on what you do with money? People still put in a few hundred dollars every month even though the wealth is massively concentrated.
People who want to use bitcoin as a store of value benefit whether or not some early adopter has 50k coins in cold storage. Same with people who want to use it for transactions for whatever reason. (Maybe they are offered a discount, do not want a credit card, etc.)

There haven't been many things to troll about lately.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:18:46
I do not have time to watch this now but based on your comment below I think I understand the gist of the argument.
You mention that it will become "cheap" to attack bitcoin. The best argument goes something like: A large percentage of the miners will need to stop mining immediately after the halving due to slim profit margins becoming large losses. As hashpower is lost, time between blocks lengthens. Bitcoins function as a currency falters as confirmations take forever - leading people to sell bitcoins off on the exchanges. The price collapses, more miners leave, it becomes worse as a currency... until we are "stuck" at a high difficulty and the hashrate is down 90-95% from the peak. From your comment you mention short selling so I am assuming the argument says someone can heavily short bitcoin to exacerbate the above problems.
Then someone needs to buy up eneough mining equipment in order to wage a 51% attack, and since the hashrate has dropped and presumably everyone is selling mining gear cheap, it will be "easy" to amass 51% of the network. Or perhaps a minin gpool could orchestrate a 51% attack.
This argument is all sound and dandy if you are really hoping bitcoin fails. .
Here is why this situation **WILL NOT** happen:
First of all, miners know almost precisely when the halving will occur. Rather than mine up until the halving and then immediately shut off and try to sell their now worthless equipment, many miners will start selling a few months beforehand. The people who buy the mining equipment also know the halving is coming, and so price that into what they are willing to pay. The effect is that hashing power stays roughly the same... who would buy a miner if they did not plan on using it and who would decide not to sell if they think their miner will be worthless in a few months.
Second reason: It is incredibly hard to buy 50% of anything. Trying to accumulate 50% of the mining hardware would be a fools game.. a lot of it may not even be listed for sale. Rather, it would sit idle just in case it becomes profitable once again. 
 
**Shouldn't this have happened during the last halving??**
I suppose it is arguments such as these which trolls must cling to in order to maintain hopes of bitcoins' demise.

Okay everyone, let's put an end to this!
Bitcoin prices are rising because bitcoin traders/investors have decided to hold a higher % of their portfolios in bitcoins, on average. Whether this means buying more or just not selling for the quick 1-2% profits, it has the same outcome.
@_date: 2016-10-14 04:41:33
No, the price stuck around 4300 CNY extremely well which indicates a bullish pattern after consolidation. The chart of the last 30 days looks good. After months of day traders using the strategy: "Sell as high as possible, but it wont go over $620", we have moved to the strategy: "buy as low as possible, but it wont go under 4300 CNY".
Day traders trying to pick up pennies while bullish sentiment builds.

Bitcoin will continue to have value if for no other reason than to just troll the nonbelievers.

I mean it's a good point but...
Go look at litecoin to see how it fared after the halving... hardly any change and you know the margins couldn't have been good beforehand. You guys wanted to use alts as test cases, well here is one of the more useful ones.
Why does it not matter much?
Miners who anticipate quitting will sell their mining gear beforehand... to people who plan on mining after the halving.

I wouldn't be so sure about that... What if on one planet bitcoins first bubble came in 2012/rather than 2011.. And you happened to look at the price mid 2011.
The butterfly effect could quite literally be one or two news articles, a misinterpretation of market dynamics, or the actions of the first 100 bitcoin users.
I guess if we ever find an alien planet, we can start bitcoin over and be the early adopters and just wait for the inevitable first bubble :)

The problem is most of you have watched this every day for two years while the price has fallen 70%. Then everyone gets excited about a 10% rise....

1: They lost money on bitcoin and want to see it fail before they can move on. Probably the majority.
2: They had an opportunity to buy in cheap and did not because of common financial advice. i.e. "don't follow anything resembling a get rich qucik scheme", "prices rising that fast must make it a ponzi scheme", "no intrinsic value", "no cash flow", "anything can be hacked", etc. etc. etc.
And then they feel worse when they watch it multiply in price by 100 (that sub started when btc was a few $ each), because they know if they had been somewhat less financially educated they would have made the jump and made a fortune. And that is a very dissatisfying thought, so they must tell us why we are all wrong and delusional because their world view did not hold.
3: They complain about the terrible community, when this is just a reflection of how the internet polarizes everything. Only the people on the extremes voice their opinions. So this is why everyone seems to be so "OMG were going to the moon!", or "You idiots, bitcoin will never succeed", when the vast majority of the people are in the middle.
Edit: Thanks for the gold! Must have said something right!

Maybe a lot of us believe that bitcoin is fine as it is, despite peoples attempt to get us to overthrow Core because their bitcoin investment did not make them as much money as they hoped; and they decided to blame the devs instead of their bad decisons.     
if bitcoin development had stalled **permanently** it's value would have still continued to rise over time. Sorry we did not have any pump and dump ICO scams to hype up bitcoin with. Sorry it is not economically feasible to buy a coffee with bitcoin.... probably because segwit and 2nd layers have been stalled by Ver
@_date: 2016-10-12 23:42:23
1: If bitcoin were a stock with a market capitalization of $10 billion, it would be considered a "Large Cap", not a penny stock.
2: All people who buy an investment are hoping that it provides more future value for them than the amount they paid; they either sell the asset at a higher price, receive a cash flow (dividends), or both. Some assets such as houses can serve additional uses. You can us it as an investment and rent it out or you can live in it. With bitcoin (digital gold) you can use it as a currency in addition to the investment.
He is clearly upset he did not buy a lot of bitcoins early and must rationalize his decision not to buy when he had the opportunity.

Media saying "Bitcoin reaches new all time high", "bitcoin trader up 10,000%", "Bitcoin up 20% in the last day", "bitcoin surpasses $100 for the first time", are the articles that caused the price to spike. The only thing the average person cares about is the price and people do not like feeling like they are missing out on something.
Both the bubble in April 2013 and November 2013 (And Summer 2011) were hugely magnified by the media, and this is why bitcoin will never slowly rise past an all time high and continue to slowly rise - it will spike hard every time.
The notion of the "weekend crash" came from all the new people depositing money on exchanges which never got credited to accounts on saturday or sunday. The price would cool off on the weekend and then surge on Monday as all the new money got credited and all the newcomers bought. It is also silly to talk about "weekend crashes" now because we are not in media hype mode.
In addition to all of this we had goxBtc being bought for goxUsd at an artificially high price. People thought the other exchanges were "cheap" and they tried to arbitrage or buy from other exchanges. The other exchanges rising brought the margins down, gox traders took advantage of smaller margins to get out --&gt; forced gox price up --&gt; more stupid people arb, etc. etc. etc. massive positive feedback loop.
Here is a bigger "secret". goxUsd propped the price up in the Summer of 2013 so that it did not fall off like the price did in 2011. The decline after the 2011 bubble is similar to the decline after the Nov 2013 bubble, similar the the decline of gold/silver after the 1980's bubble, decline of 3d printing bubble etc... The april 2013 bubble was supposed to decline like all of these other bubbles... except for the goxUSD propping the price up, and when the april 2013 all time high was breached, a new bubble was all but guaranteed from the clueless media.
It continues to baffle me why everything I said above is not common knowledge. Well i guess the more you know....

We are already at about 0.1% of the market cap of gold.
It is also good to point out that around $100 billion of gold is mined per year for an inflation rate (if you will) of a couple percent. 
$100 billion isn't very easy to absorb for a commodity in a long term downtrend.

i got 73,174 - bumping the hashrate 38.969% each time for the first 35 periods (starting with with 7.16*1.38969 mh/s) Doing this, you will mine 70,560 blocks in 50.37095 weeks. The difficulty at the end of this period will be 0.518 TH/S. Then bumping this all the way up to 1 TH/S you'll solve the next 2016 blocks in 1.036 weeks. Then you have 0.594 weeks left to mine at 10 mins/block... gives another 598 blocks.
i assumed 52 weeks in a year, or 364 days, so you can add another 144 blocks if you want to make it 365 days =)

The argument boils down to realizing that it doesn't matter how terrible deflation is or is not - bitcoin is not going anywhere.

@_date: 2015-02-20 20:36:40
Just like you will die making your landlord richer, warren buffet richer, your boss richer, walmart richer, etc. etc. etc.
Or i guess you could hoard all your cash you have now in your mattress and live off the streets begging for whatever you need... but then the value of your cash will slowly get eaten away by inflation (may i suggest bitcoin). Alternatively you could start only purchasing products from companies going out of business, only stocks from companies that are going down in value, and if renting a house, trashing it beyond repair. Then I suppose you will not need to worry about making other people rich.

I think we all want to use it as a currency but it is a bit of a hassle when only a few places accept it. I think what we need to do is to agree on one day of the week where we all make at least 1 bitcoin transaction.

Well the only time most people will even consider the arguments for bitcoin is when it is breaking new all time highs... when it is in a bubble. If the average person hears about bitcoin in any other time frame other than that two week window they will completely disregard it.

Other than that nothing lol - especially not a ponzi scheme which says "we will multiply it by 20 and give you half" and  then in the next sentence says "we will return 100 times your investment". They are so lazy they are not even consistent.

It would only be a problem if bitcoin was worth at least a few hundred times what it is worth today. But then it is not rational to simply say "i do not want to buy bitcoin because it is not *supposed* to go up"

There is no incentive to do this as it would cause the price to completely collapse almost immediately. In addition, I do not think it as easy as you suggest it to be - look at how much debate has come from just discussing increasing the block size.

As it currently stands this is highly highly unlikely. Only if Satoshi himself dumped 1 million btc and put the proceeds I to bcc, in my opinion.

@_date: 2015-02-21 08:33:18
Well about 3600 btc are mined per day right now...
In 8 halvings (so about 29 years) only about 14 btc will be mined per day.
Currently about 14 btc are paid in fees per day... 
so at current rates and assuming no growth in transactions per day (or lower fees), fees will be more important than block rewards in 29 years.
At current prices that is only $6k to buy all of the bitcoins earned by miners per day... so we should all hope the price of bitcoin is much higher by then =)
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:38:03

The other thing is that there is no way they would create a currency in which they have no control over monetary policy. So bitcoin automatically wins against any government crypto.
It is funny when i hear people say: "If bitcoin is so good governments will copy it and make bitcoin obsolete". Sure governments may copy it but after you attract people to crypto they will come to bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-07-05 05:41:01
i think i saw someone do a calculation like this assuming all 21 million bitcoins were mined and we spread it out by putting 1 satoshi into as many addresses as possible, and it is still so unlikely to ever hack one of them that we do not need to worry about it.

They are wrong because it is nearly impossible to predict the future and they were asked near the peak of a massive speculative bubble when a lot of those people probably made $100k+ on their bitcoins in a few months.
And what about the people who predicted $100+ bitcoin back in 2012 or earlier. Why do people think it **won't** go up *this* time?
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:43:07
Nope... no respect for ponzi scams or those who advertise them.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:45:42
That's interesting...
I think you need to keep the average time per blocks constant for the full year (increase the hashrate the same % every 2016 blocks). Assume you will be mining at 1 TH/S for the last period. You also have the constraint that the difficulty cannot be less than 1, so you cannot start with a hashrate of 1 hash/second.
Do you know what the minimum hashrate you need in order to mine on average 1 block per 10 minutes with a difficulty of 1 is?
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:46:51

Okay but presumably there is some probably it is between $20k - $30k, some probably it is between $10k - $20k, some probability for every dollar value.
Integrating over the probability distribution we get the expected value... Which we are hoping is much more than the current price!
But yeah, if it was 1% of getting $30k, 99% of $0, then yes that would be a bad gamble if you paid anything over $300 for that bet.

You work at a job which means you are using your time to help someone else become richer and to pursue their dreams.

Okay everyone: Bitcoin is stupid because it has the potential to rise in price rapidly!
If you can pair your buys with puts you can eliminate much of the downside risk.

I remember I wrote a program that generated random numbers using videos. I would pick a random 10 x 10 pixel section, add up the color values of each pixel in binary, and take the last digit.
Generate as many digits as you need to make a random number.
I remember it seemed to work good for some videos, but some did not look random at all, and I couldn't figure out why.
I really wanted to set up a camera next to a waterfall or something else that is always changing, and then snap a new picture every time I needed a new random number.

It comes down too the fact that the probability distribution is fat-tailed for bitcoins future price which gives us a much greater expected future value than what is currently perceived by the market.

Basically the market tries to reach an equilibrium where there is just eneough demand to reach the supply. The supply is coming from traders wanting to cash out plus the 3600 coins that ate mined per day. Those 3600 coins may not immediately be dumped, but some percentage of them are and so there is some average number that are sold on the market every day.
The demand is coming from traders wanting to buy and from long term holders.
The volume of trades coming from the traders is much larger than the volume from the long term buyers (hoarders) and from the new coins being mined.
So when the new supply is cut in half, the long term hoarders are forced to buy more from the day traders... And the price needs to move up to a different equilibrium.
However, the price has already risen substantially so some or all of the halvening may be priced in.
If we can reach a new all time high, the media will hype it up and a lot more long term hoarders and traders will join us and we would have another bubble.
