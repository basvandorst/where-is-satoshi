as someone who wont have to pay for his electricity for a year AND will have his computer on almost literally 100% of the time, I would love for some GPU/CPU support. 20c might be a few dollars later, or nothing. but hey.

For all the bad press this sub gets, it's the little things like this that still keep me here. Happy 300k OP.

"I want to invest some money into BTC while we wait for moon launch"

Is this atrophy of rewards because the amount of remaining blocks is diminishing or because of a planned reduction of rewards?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:17:08
Excellent this is all stuff I like to know. Thanks a bundle.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:09:12
That was my reaction too.

Would having all 21M mined effect the price at all?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:17:54

"Oh look Australian money."
