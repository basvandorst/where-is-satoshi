That is what they said (some still do) about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:48:29
Have you considered switching to bch?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:29:36
Good thing you used fiat, the fees would have been higher with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:22:40
That is life changing man, congratulations! 
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:49:14
Smart move, hope it works out for them.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:49:32
Hopefully we will see it on the DNMs soon!
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:39:44
People were saying the same thing about bitcoin a few years ago too. Although, you still can't buy much with bitcoin either, and with fees as high as they are now, who would want to buy stuff with bitcoin besides drugs.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:04:55
And because the block sizes are much larger and confirmation times are faster too, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:32:59
Yes, you can select to pay as high or low of a fee as you would like. I have seen posts on here of people accidentally paying over 1btc as a fee!
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:21:30
Which alt coin was it?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:00:46
Microtransactions, one of the things that really appealed to me in the beginning. I have been working on a project using bitcoin microtransactions on and off the last few years. It is not possible with legacy bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:53:44
Why would people sell their bch? The much smaller fees and larger block sizes make it more appealing to consumers than btc. Maybe people should sell their btc instead?
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:34:26
He is probably going long on litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:55:48
And lost a ton of hashing power, even being overtaken by bch at one point.
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:53:01
Why are bch fees so low then?
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:02:17
Do your research
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:07:58
How much was the fee?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:42:16
The bitcointalk.org forums have very good discussions. r/btc isn't too bad either.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:35:50
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:55:35
All of the names you guys come up with for bitcoin 2.0 are funny.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:32:53
So bch can adjust difficulty whenever they please, is that really a thing?
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:20:49
Good strategy, but most people in this sub hodl no matter how far the price of bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:45:40
We need vendors to start accepting bch
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:55:05
There would be a hell of a lot less people invested in cryptocurrency if it were not for him. He has done an excellent job explaining it to the masses.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:25:55
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:14:47
This is pretty bad, why would anyone use bitcoin over fiat to buy anything aside from drugs?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:38:26
It didn't even take a month for Bcash to reach $600, if it continues to climb this rapidly it will surpass legacy bitcoin very soon!
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:41:34
Good for now so I can accumulate more before it moons!
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:19:59
I remember when this sub wasn't spammed with posts about price and focused mainly on technical discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:14:51
So you think Andreas Antonopolous is an idiot?
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:24:27
Thanks for sharing, I love Schiff's podcast.
@_date: 2017-08-29 03:52:09
That is awesome! Good to see more big players getting involved.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:29:46
Of course everybody got excited about price in the past as well, but the excitement was contained in fewer threads. Technical discussion was always the highlight of the sub. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:54:59
The EDA doesn't work the other way? If the hash power increases a large amount, they do not have an EDA to increase difficulty?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:30:11
You really think bch will die? That is a statement many have made about altcoins, yet most reached all time highs since then. Bch actually had more hash power than bitcoin did the other day, having a coin that has been around less than a month gain more hashing power than bitcoin says a lot about the future of bch.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:02:17
Nothing wrong with that, they are still helping to secure the network with their hashing power. That is how it is supposed to work.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:22:27
For every article like this, there are also articles saying the opposite.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:28:21
Smart kid, won't be this cheap for much longer.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:19:19
The problem is, the fees are too high. We have more users than ever, if the fees had stayed the same as they were a year ago, the miners would still be making more per block in fees due to the rise in users. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:07:37
It is not used because it has not been adopted as widely as bitcoin has with merchants and vendors, that will not last though.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:34:29
You are a kind soul, thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:15:31
I sold 10 btc at $960 and 100 ETH at 10.36. Bought at 500 for btc, and 7.30 for ETH.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:00:02
So, how do you feel about the current state of mining and the high unconfirmed transactions in legacy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:22:18
See, the problem with this, is that the writer could be heavily invested in btc and would like to hype up bitcoin to get clueless speculators to start buying to make his position more profitable. Just like this sub calls Peter Schiff a goldbug, the authors of these articles could be bitcoinbugs trying to suade people into what will benefit themselves. But most people here are so crazy about bitcoin, they fail to think of that.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:04:03
RMC has real potential to be one of the top coins on the market. The whitepaper blew me away.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:00:36
Another one of these
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:13:02
Wish I could help, I am wondering the same thing these days.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:44:45
"DO NOT USE YOUR BITCOINS, UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED IT"
I disagree, it is good to spend your bitcoin and support the merchants and vendors accepting crypto. If nobody used btc to buy things vendors would stop accepting them and it wouldn't be adopted in the future by more vendors.
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:08:14
I really enjoyed the podcast, it is nice to see other perspectives.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:32:42
I posted a few of those if you read down the comment chain some more.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:52:48
Just like everybody else that posts here. Perma bulls for life.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:20:25
This is why I'm using BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:35:35
It was so hyped up but it is barely being used lol.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:58:28
I doubt you would say this if bitcoin had 8mb blocks
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:40:28
So everytime miners move back to bitcoin, they can do this to bring them back?
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:01:47
How is this fake news?
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:41:04
Or you could sell and buy a larger amount back later on!
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:33:03
If people are willing to pay that much, I see nothing wrong with them trying to make some extra profit.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:22:08
Another one of these. If people want to sell and take some profit, let them.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:30:09
There will always be doubters, but it is pretty obvious Craig is Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:49:15
Nice try shill
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:42:30
In your dreams.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:40:26
I really love the drops, love to see the panic posts on here.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:44:52
Hodlers about to get a massive wakeup call soon!
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:26:05
Have you considered switching to vaping instead?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:41:09
Fine with me, we need to support those that support and secure the network.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:03:23
Wish I had some, nothing is certain with crypto price though. I would read some of the latest technical analysis to see what other people think may happen.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:27:24
Soon to be 50% off!
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:45:19
Good luck to them, I hope it is very disruptive and a massive success. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:41:30
Hey Satoshi! Thanks for clearing things up!
