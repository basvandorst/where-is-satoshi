DigitalX also provide Bitcoin liquidity to institutional investors and large commercial operators via DigitalX Direct, for the month of April alone it produced revenue of $4 million or a 118% increase. Based on the Bitcoin price movements over May and June IMO the revenue for the quarter will be pretty impressive. The quarterly report release in July should make for some very interesting reading. :)

One thing I still struggle to understand with the Bitcoin community is how quick people are to find negatives in things. Not you specifically OpenPodBayDoorsHAl just found in general this to be the case?. 
Here is an Australian Securities Exchange Listed Bitcoin/Blockchain Fintech company trying to develop and create Bitcoin and Blockchain solutions to assist people to do things in a more user friendly and safe manner. 
I don't get it people are already paying fees to top up their phone minutes, why not do it utilising a Bitcoin/Blockchain solution which in the end benefits all Bitcoin users, by increasing the adoption and awareness of Bitcoin users. 
"Send cash to ATM's worldwide", how do we know DigitalX isn't working with a payment provider or bank which world enable them to utilise Bitcoin/Blockchain tech to send an Aircode with Airpocket app to an ATM in another country or region? 
They have signed a MOU with a leading Mexican Payment company with access to over 10 million users across regions covered by the agreement, which may enable users to do this?
 
I know people in the Bitcoin community have been burnt before re Exchanges ect although IMO we should be encouraging and promoting more companies such as DigitalX in the Bitcoin space, as it will only benefit us in the long run :)

ASX Listed DigitalX (DCC) had a very good trading day today up over 11%, nice to see a Bitcoin/Blockchain company doing well whilst most other sectors of the market are going down after BREXIT shock. :)

Thanks for the link to article nice to see an Australian Bitcoin/Blockchain company getting some support :)
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:26:45
Not disagreeing with your comment at all what you are saying is absolutely true, but what is not true is that in some way this particular company doesn't exist or that I'm trying to pull the wool over someones eyes.
 
Put it this way I can't make anyone ring up a Broker and place a buy order to purchase shares in any company, that's up to the individual.
What I can do however is inform people in the Bitcoin community how I am making personal investment decisions, then it is up to the individual to do their own research and make their own decisions. 
 
For me the positives out way the negatives for my personal  investment in DigitalX,
Some Positives
Been on the ASX for over 2 years and have managed to transition business model away from expensive Bitcoin mining to other sources of revenue. 
DigitalX remains in a strong financial position with no debt and US$2.5m in cash, bitcoin and receivables at 
31st March 2016   
Other than directly buying Bitcoins this company is the only Bitcoin/Blockchain company on the ASX, which means if the sheep in Australia finally wake up and discover the benefits of Bitcoin but don't know how to buy Bitcoin. IMO they will look to get exposure to Bitcoin on the share market and this company is the only company available.
Signed a partnership with Telefonica one of the largest companies in the world
Have multiple types of business revenue, last of the Bitcoin mining revenue this quarter, revenue from the Bitcoin liquidity desk, and soon to have revenue from AirPocket app
Good management that hold majority of this shares in company which means if the share price goes up not only do they benefit but retail investors do also, makes them work harder in other words
Have completed development of app AirPocket so cash burn should be reduced going forward
Some Negatives/risks
They don't get the downloads of the app they had hoped for
Reduction in volatility or volume of Bitcoin means less revenue from liquidity desk
Recent MOU with large Mexican payments company doesn't eventuate
Currently the share price is in down trend because it is close to end of financial year so investors sometime sell shares at a loss to claim tax benefit and then buy them back at start of new financial year. So be careful picking your entry share prices not just with this company but any company at this time of year.
Don't take my word for it though DYOR :)
Thanks for the reply,

Yep first major partnership for DigitalX is with Telefonica one of the largest Telecommunications companies in the world. They have also signed a MOU with one of Mexico's largest payment providers although we are still waiting to find out who partner is. 
Why price so low?,
This company is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), IMO the Australian Mainstream Public doesn't have a great deal of knowledge in regards to Bitcoin/Blockchain, although I think this is changing.  
When investors finally wake up and realise this is the only company on the ASX with any exposure to the Bitcoin/Blockchain space, IMO the Share Price will then reflect the real value of this company. 
DYOR :)

Hi Bitcoin_forever,
Just trying to assist the Bitcoin community by promoting companies and services in the Bitcoin Sector, it's up to the individual to take the information I am providing and make their own decisions. 
I am only commenting on companies I am familiar with or invested in myself DigitalX for example, and services or apps that I use personally such as Breadwallet.
Nothing sinister mate just doing my bit, might be of interest to you to check out DigitalX, They first started as a Bitcoin mining company, they also buy and sell Bitcoin via their product DigitalX Direct, and the Blockchain they are using to send and receive information with the AirPocket app is actually the Bitcoin Blockchain. :)
Check out some of my previous posts DigitalX reddit posts if you
like, :)
Some other links to DigitalX
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:04:23
Two good solid points you have made iplaymage you should be able to keep track of app downloads of the AirPocket app via websites such as,
It has been approx 4.5 months since announcement of the MOU with payments company, so hopefully start of new financial year we get an announcement in regards to this. :)
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:00:46
Nice to see that whilst most sectors of the Australian Stock Market are in the red today due to global concerns over the BREXIT, a Bitcoin/Blockchain company is up over 11% for the day. :)

Not sure what else I can say Bitcoin_forever just trying to point out a company that if you want to invest in you can if not don't worry about it :), 
If you have never heard of the co-founder and chairman of the company Zhenya Tsvetnenko here is a news article from the Australian Financial Review.

Instead of customers information and transaction details being held by a central Business that can be stolen or hacked, transactions via the AirPocket app are recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Which to date has never been hacked an would be very difficult to do so as we all know. 
Some quotes taken from AirPocket Investors Presentation,
"Users on the platform have immediate, incontestable, independent proof of all their transactions which they can unlock and verify via public/private key encryption principles"
"These annotated payment records on the blockchain 
serve as a system of credit monitoring and can be used to build a financial identity for the young and under-banked, for those who seek lending, and for informal cash businesses in the developing 
"AirPocket uses blockchain technology but does not 
use Bitcoins to send or store value. The key use of 
blockchain technology lies in its decentralized nature as an 
independent but indisputable, public ledger of all transactions"

Bitcoin_forever how did you first discover or learn about Bitcoin?, what companies in the Bitcoin sector in Australia have you had personal experience with, or you would recommend?

On Tuesday the 28th June the marketing campaign for DigitalX AirPocket App will begin, it's partner Telefonica will direct SMS promote Airpocket to 230 million Telefonica mobile devices across Latin America. 
DigitalX is the only Bitcoin/Blockchain company listed on the Australia Stock Exchange, it's ticker code is DCC

I guess we will just have to agree to disagree :), although I agree it would have to be a very good scam to defraud the Australian Governments Securities Exchange Commission (ASIC) and list a public company on the ASX and pretend they have thousands of investors
Thanks for your reply though :)
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:16:15
This is a very good point I hadn't thought of this :)
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:23:34
DigitalX receives a commission on the amount of the top up which can range between US$2 and US$70 per instance which is paid by Telefonica not the customer, in return DigitalX can return some of that commission back to the customer via bonus top up time, social media credit ect. 
This deal with Telefonica will enable people to top up mobile phone credit although additional features of AirPocket app will include ability to,
Send cash across borders
App-to-app money transfers
Local currency cash withdrawals for travelers, available 24/7
Send cash to be withdrawn at ATMs worldwide
Top up relatives’ phone credit across borders
Pay relatives’ bills across borders 
Buy goods and services for relatives’ across borders
Use as a point of sale payment system for merchants
Potential for peer-to-peer lending for the under banked
Potential for peer-to-peer invoicing and payment system
 
IMO it was a brilliant decision by DigitalX to partner with Telefonica, one DigitalX increases revenue through mobile top ups which in itself could be huge, and two it is also a cost effective method to attract customers who will then take advantage of additional features of AirPocket app as they are added.

@_date: 2016-06-24 18:54:48
At the moment the app allows users to top up mobile air time, although coming soon you will be able to use app for remittance. IMO smart move by DigitalX first partner with Telefonica who has hundreds of millions of customers, then once customers are acquired at the expense of Telefonica roll out the remittance or P2P services on the app. 
Remembering that this is only one partnership with one company albeit a massive company, so still plenty of upside with further partnerships in the pipeline and expansion into other markets and countries. Just the tip of the iceberg for the potential of this app IMO.

I believe you are confused with calculation b_lumenkraft ☺

Reading back over my post does sound a litttle spamy sorry. I have no connection to the company other than I am a shareholder, although I am pretty excited with where they are heading. They started more as a bitcoin mining operation, although have been transitioning to software solutions.

The beauty of the Airpocket App IMO is that it will have a range of uses all taking advantage of the Bitcoin Blockchain's efficiency and security, such as  
Topping up phone Airtime like with Telefonica Deal
Sending money or remittance services across borders
  
Bill paying services
In store purchases
 
Providing people/individuals with business opportunities to become an Air Agent (Currency Exchange Business)
Potential to send Aid across borders
IMO this deal with Telefonica is a brilliant cost effective way to build up AirPocket's user base, by using Telefonica's existing client base. Rather than having to rely on expensive marketing to try and attract users. 
Once they have a solid user base they can then start adding additional features to the app.

Hi thanks for taking the time to produce your list it will come in handy while I'm doing my research.
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:51:46
The figures I gave is the potential commission that would be paid by Telefónica to DigitalX, it doesn't cost the user anything to use AirPocket to top up phone account. 
A user wants to top up phone credit for family member in mexico, the cost to the user is $30 for certain amount of phone hours. The cost to Telefónica for phone hours may be $5 so they have made a  profit of $25. 
From this $25 they would pay the 11% commission (on original $30 Paid by user to Telefónica) to DigitalX for using their service AirPocket. In return DigitalX have stated they could offer back a percentage of their 11% commission to users by offering them additional phone time for example, in order to attract customers to use the App.   
@_date: 2016-05-14 23:43:15
Thanks for recommendations I will do some research
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:17:37
They also updated the AirPocket website this morning for more information.

For those that are interested announcement released today on the ASX, Digital X Bitcoin liquidity desk has receive incease of 118% to over 4 million in revenue for month of April and the Telco group will be announced in the coming days. 
Link to ASX Announcemnt 
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:05:59
With this partnership the 11% commision is paid by Telefónica when users top up phone credit not the user. However with the money tranfers there would be a fee paid by user although I believe this is much cheaper and safer then competitors such as Western Union,.taking advantage of using the Bitcoin blockchain to store/transfer information.
Some examples of potential revenues, 
1% of just this telco partnerships 100million users you are looking at the following revenue from Airpocket alone, 11% Gross from cost of phone air time top ups ranging from $2 to $70 lets say average of $30 per top up per user per month 1,000,000 users (1% of 100,000,000 users) = $3.3 million per month $39,600,000 year.
I believe it is currently available on the USA app stores for download

I'm just glad that someone in Australia is making an effort to established a Bitcoin/Blockchain company, whilst dealing with what was initially quite a hostel environment politically in Australia for Bitcoin. 
Just have a look at Coinjar for example decided to move operations to Uk to avoid issues with GST ect. At least things are slowly changing on the political front albeit at snails pace.
@_date: 2016-05-14 23:39:56
Thanks Outcast3k,
I have read about Ryan Zhou and his dealings in the past thanks for the link, being based in Australia Coinjar was the first wallet I used, mainly to buy then immediately transfer to cold storage. 
Thanks for advice cheers.

“Sounds like a ponzi scheme”
