Oh well, we have to see who uses it. Since, before this, the fork also was "never gonna happen lol." 
For the record, I don't think that will happen, it would require an exceedingly unlikely series of miracles for that many people to accidentally double their money.

I always lose this game.

Ether is an altcoin too, it's not exactly losing to ETC.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:04:26
It's almost like a decentralized system is...working exactly how it should...

They are all at least experienced enough not to go all in

I think you'd be more upset that you went to jail? It's not crazy because it's software that's not copyrighted. That's how this works. That's how all of this works.

I...How long have you been doing this? I've only been trading for some months and I already assume that literally everything will come packaged with herds of confused users screaming about how they can't get the ["stupid peice of shit that doesn't do the god damn thing it's supposed to"](
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:30:05
Yeah for all the emotion slinging back and forth between here and there I wonder why people are acting like this is some kind of anomalous thing? In this decentralized economy I keep seeing the sentiment like in the OP, mentioning "centralization" and insinuating that people only don't know better if they follow one coin or another. It's the same with ETH, though, so I guess a lot of people just carry their crypto close to their heart rather than their wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:54:30
Well that was a dumb place to take that argument
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:44:53


We don't. This is the only way people learn, and it's the defining characteristic of crypto, or one of them. 
The system has to be able to heal itself and to adapt, as a whole, there is never going to be a context, with successful blockchain/crypto tech, where we got that way by trying to stop other people from making mistakes by fighting or avoiding. 
This fork proves that going your own way is the solution in this system.

Haha. Like they give a fuck, the exchanges make so much money on the little guy losing what he can't afford it should be illegal. 
It's because they don't want to let the little guy behind the curtain, and also because people at large have shit where their brains are supposed to be and businesses don't want to go under because of a runaway market sentiment from a bunch of idiots who think they know "the market."

This, and remember not to form your opinions by stupid shit you hear on Reddit/Discord. 
It took months for me to realize that, no, these people aren't as knowledgeable as they say. I made a lot of fucking mistakes to learn that lesson as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:58:40
There are a lot of people here who pretend to know what the fuck they are talking about, who in fact, do not. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:02:59
The answer is simple when you see what's happening. 
As a fork, the second balance, new coins, is like an alternate reality for the blockchain, but one where the owner isn't different. 
If your coins are on an exchange, whoever has control of the private keys which house the proof of ownership on the blockchain, owns the new coin. So the exchanges that "don't support it" will own it.

Angelfire and Lycos, back when cjb.net was the closest to a custom domain you could get for free. Those were the days. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:51:27
It's coming from both sides. I don't have an emotional dog in this fight like everyone else here, and from an outsider's objective opinion, both camps are going to turn away any of the general public that happens to wander in. Crypto is confusing enough, the forks aren't that hard to figure out. ETC and ETH were not at the mercy of their names. 
All of you are acting like fucking idiots to be frank. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:53:44
Kinda also the issue
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:59:40
It doesn't. I guess I'm not as angry at news sources as you; Is CNBC full of "Libtard snowflakes" or "Republicans?"
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:47:33
I've been bouncing between both subs and there's provably more "trolls" fucking with the folks. Just for the sake of objectivity. Which I guess is a completely buried concept at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:52:35
I consequently it's only true because it's too good to be true. A blockchain hard fork can only do this, a lot of people will basically burn the new coin tho because they don't care about it. But people will be trying to make a million from it. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:57:08
This is how it happens, but people who've been trading crypto for a while tend to get jaded I guess. They act like the absolutely boggling design and functionality of some of the more janky exchanges should just make sense to people, when in reality it's intimidating. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:27:52
You are not on a team. This is a terrible fucking position to take. Trust is not the single most important factor in financial systems, what is wrong with you? 
You're going to cause people to make terrible mistakes with their money. You need to stop.
