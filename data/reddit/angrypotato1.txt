it seems he deleted his comment which made a personal attack against the user.

Lol what. I've spent hours mining doge and trading btc let alone doing other crypto things. We encourage crypto usage in the subreddit too, it's just that your post was off topic.

the two graphs are just correlation, not causation. There really hasn't been any other evidence to act as a a casual link (and plenty of evidence to suggest they are separate people). If you find one, let us or/and the subreddit know.
