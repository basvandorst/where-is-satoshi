No, my credit union is enthusiastic about bitcoin. When I first started making large withdrawals, they asked me what was going on, got confused, called the corporate office for guidance on how to handle it, asked me more questions, figured it out, then invited me to join their wealth management program, where they have been very keen to keep up to date on the state of cryptocurrencies.
As for not calling cryptocurrencies currencies, your ignorance belies you, despite your supposed profession. Currency is simply a representation of wealth that mutual parties agree to exchange, and requires no clearing house to be legitimate, despite your assertion otherwise. (See: Solomon Island shell necklaces, Rai stones.) And even if it did, crypto smart contracts provide mechanisms to eliminate counterparty risks, which disproves the need for a centralized clearing house anyway. (Checkmate.)
Your schadenfreude is misplaced. Your head is in the sand. You won't necessarily be left behind, but your ignorance is a hinderance to your own technical, monetary, and societal progress.

It's currency if as few as two people use it as a mechanism for exchanging value. Many, many more than two use it regularly. Just because I never use Bolivars and am unlikely ever to use it doesn't mean suddenly it's not a currency. Same thing with Rai stones, Solomon Island shells, or whatever Canadians are using to buy their tires with these days.
Bitcoin is a currency, no matter how much you shake your fist at it.
Also, please define what you mean when you say bitcoin has been "hacked", because I am pretty sure you are conflating bitcoin with stores of bitcoin on exchanges. They are not the same. I have a funny feeling you know a lot less about bitcoin than you think you know.

Well, since I'm blocked (isn't that a hate crime? So hard to tell what I'm supposed to be offended at any more), you will probably never learn from your mistakes, but for the benefit of the two people who will ever actually read this, I must point out that your continued and deliberate projection of hate and outrage belies your own objectivity. My own participation in this thread was made with pure eyerolling and bemusement. Where you see hate, examine a mirror. Where you see conflation, go read your own post with objective analysis and an eye for eliminating your own cognitive biases. 
You do realize that almost everything you attributed to me was either a parent poster or your own words, right? It's a shame, really, that the kneejerk reactions you made were based entirely on your own bias and not on objective reality. I'm not surprised that you escaped into a bubble of self absorbtion to avoid the confrontation you surely saw coming. 
The hate within you has blinded you to rational discussion. Now it's eyerolling, bemusement, and pity.

Debt that generates cash flow is good. Debt from stuff you buy or for intangibles like education is bad. Unless you have an interest rate under the inflation rate... but most of the time when that happens (furniture stores, Best Buy, etc.) you are paying more up front for the inflated price of the goods or services, so either way paying cash for that kind of stuff somewhere else is almost always better.
Debt for buying a positive cash flow property like an apartment complex in a growing market...that can be good debt.

You can print a paper wallet offline (or at least display on a second screen) from the private key, and scan the QR code from Mycelium - then you can use its cold storage option as others have referenced. 
Use bitaddress.org to create the paper wallet, just click the "wallet details" button and enter the private key there.
There are ways of doing that offline if it's enough money to make you nervous about security.

What good is competition if there aren't winners and losers?
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:12:47
One of the reasons credit card fees are 2-3% is because it costs the cc companies money to keep the infrastructure necessary to handle chargebacks and their associated appeals. (It's not a large part, but it's a part). Then there are "cash back" and "rewards" systems which from a practical standpoint just charge consumers for what they give back as rewards... Another big part is the number of layers of complexity in the cc world. Issuing companies + processing companies + gateway companies + merchant banks...everyone adds a bit to the fee for themselves. That behemoth has wayyyyyyy too much inertia to be able to pivot and compete directly with bitcoin's 2-party transaction system. So you're right - if consumers want to save on fees and are willing to give up the chargeback protection offered by credit cards, then merchants can lower prices by the amount they currently pay for cc transactions and everyone (but the banks) wins

The recent tax guidance in the US is a huge barrier to adoption - no _de minimis_ level for crypto transactions, every single transaction is a taxable event.

"Here, use this crypto wallet, it's the future! Also, be sure you know your cost basis for every transaction (the wallet doesn't know this by default if you get your coins somewhere else, after all).

Anything from bitcoin.com is not "official" in the sense you are using the word. It's run by one guy who thinks he speaks for the enlightened ones. (He's able to fool a lot of people into thinking he's the official authority, unfortunately.)
That said, bitcoin wallets can hold the same private keys as other wallets simultaneously. Don't think of a wallet as holding your bitcoin, think of a wallet as holding a very long password that allow you to spend your bitcoin. More than one wallet might store the same password. So, if you use one wallet to spend your bitcoin, the other wallet(s) will reflect that spend as well.

First of all, it's just indicated hashrate, not contractually or legally required hashrate. Secondly, if the price of bitcoin is more than 10% the price of the new altcoin, there will be incredibly strong economic incentive for miners to change their minds. And, finally, if you think miners control how people spend their money, you're wrong - they may have eventual influence, but not control. All signs point to an effect similar to the previous altfork brouhaha.

great question - and I'm not in any way qualified to answer it, but I'll give you my opinion anyway :) I think that, overall, yes - bitcoin is finding its value, but it has a long way to go, because the current paradigm is still pegging value to [insert your local fiat currency here]. I mentioned 25 years earlier, because in my mind, that might be the soonest time when there might be a fundamental shift from "how much is bitcoin worth in terms of USD?", and more toward "how many USD is that worth in terms of bitcoin?"
If that happens, then yeah, this will have been an exciting time to be alive, for sure. And yes, I do believe that if it is to happen, it must happen well before the final coins are mined.

if you're thinking about things that are priced in dollars/yen/pounds/etc., then yes, you're going to get some pretty wild speculation swings going on compared to those currencies. If, however, you believe that in the future (say, 25 years or so) all things will be pegged to a cryptocurrency, whether that be what we currently know as bitcoin or whatever, then it starts to make a lot more sense *as a base currency*. That's the experiment: can we create an economy that is centered around a stable global currency that goods and services are pegged to instead of being pegged to dollars and such?

"anyone with knowlege" - either that's you, or it's someone you trust (in the vast majority of cases, it's blind trust in the benevolence and time of strangers.) 
If you trust strangers for your security, it's completely immaterial to the question of security if the source is open or not. It either is secure, or it is not. Openness of source has no bearing on this.
"With closed source the hack will remain secret". Uh...wut? That's not in any way true. The hack of a closed source package can remain secret or become common knowledge, just as the hack of an open source package can remain secret or become common knowledge. It's a function of time and effort, and both open and closed sources packages rely on third parties to disclose the hack if found outside the normal control mechanisms. Again, you're reduced to trusting third parties to do the right thing for your security.
And don't conflate the concept of belief in security with the concept of knowledge of security. These are not the same thing.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:08:38
This is a fallacy. 
Open source is not magic, and does not create security. It allows for end users to verify security, if they want to audit the code themselves, but in practice that doesn't actually happen.
In practice, either the end user trusts the closed source code maintainers to ensure security, or they trust the open source code maintainers to ensure security. But either way, trust exists necessarily, and openness of the code does not create actual security by nature of its openness.
