Yup 1mb is wonderful, it's perfect. 2mb on the other hand, oh man... thats WAY TOO MUCH
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:13:01
Yea, 1.05mb blocks on average. Great stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:22:46
Currently, BTC is at 305k and BCH at 46k.

If Bitcoin aims to be a store of value, why is it constantly butthurt about losing adoption in micropayments/commercial use?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:07:35
Oh dear god...

Risk doesnt equate to gamble. You might trip on your next step, hit your head and die. But walking isn't a gamble.

Tabs finally saving the world.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:19:43
Yea those people without a bank are much more interested in running a full node than sending txs in a fast and cheap manner
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:13:45
And a store of value!
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:10:03
Bitcoin can't even run itself efficiently right now...

Wow, a thread praising blockstream. What a weird timeline
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:25
Its because there isn't anything to back that claim... But a lot of people like to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:18:26
Roger is not BCH. Just like Luke Jr isn't BTC

And who is? Brazil is in the middle of a huge crisis with no sight of relief. I believe an 'economics' guy is better suited for a time like this than someone who'd focus on the 'huge problems' you cited.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:17:14
AntPool just mined the PERFECT block in Luke Jr's vision! lmao
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:20:17
Yea i guess he's pretty happy right now. Go AntPool!
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:37:54
You're spinning this way out of proportion/context.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:24:23
Blockstream seems pretty in control...
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:18:51
Those are still 50k unconfirmed transactions... Other than that everything else is fine
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:14:05
If 8mb was to be as full and unuseable as 1mb is today, in only 2 months, Bitcoin is in for a rough time.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:30:51
True, but 50k is still a lot, 1 month ago that'd be near the ATH for stuck transactions
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:20:27
Im just here to be a part of history. Hello :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:10:46
If you're not getting paid to post this, I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:17:56
50k+ transactions are above 100sats/b. I wouldn't say this is exclusively spam
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:44:25
If by 'while' you mean 12h, then yea.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:02:36
Im guessing most people there are willing to trade 2min for what you (or some other local) said is worth literal days of labor..
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:29:53
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:31:56
Well the average block size is around 1.03mb right now...
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:34:46
Nah and meh
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:29:34
2x would save you a lot in terms of fees instantly though (atleast until segwit is on par with it tx/s-wise, and that could take some time)
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:55:16
What have they done in the past couple years? Genuine question, i'd like to listen more about Core from a good perspective.
