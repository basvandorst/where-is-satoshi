What is the difference between BCH and Bitcoin pre fork, other then the blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:13
Have you looked into the scalability of any of the other ones? What would be the limitation for ether, once sharding and PoS are integrated?

Segwit was not part of bitcoin before the fork. The BCH network is more than secure and decentralised enough, it seems to me.
So I ask again, if BCH is inferior to litecoin now, why wasn't bitcoin inferior to litecoin 6 months ago?

Sure, bigger blocks on smaller hashrate is more vulnerable. But do you have an objective indicator about how vulnerable or are you just echo-ing?
A lower hashrate makes it more vulnerable, but not neccesary vulnerable. Please show me a metric that indicates hoe immenent/easy an attack on the BCH is?
Meanwhile, you also imply that BTC is not really decentralised, because 'btc miners could attack BCH if they coordinated'. If you can truly organise this, BTC is much more centralised then you think it is.

So by this logic, you are saying that bitcoin, before the fork, was also inferior to litecoin?

How do you link energy consumption with resilience against attacks? What kind of attacks?
Energy consumption follows the price, it doesn't protect it.

As it is going viral, begging might be +EV
I'm wondering whether this will work. Could someone tip me a house?
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:33:55
It is a way to tip somebody in bit(coin)s. Reply to a post by typing followed with the amount you want to tip.
If you receive, press `collect it` and collect it:)

I think I'm gonna need proof...

No, coindesk can give you details on the history of the price. Google it!

I'm wondering how long this will keep going on. changetips are everywhere.

Don't need to. I know what it is and how it works. 
Was the proof of work algoritm changed for BCH? On what do you base the claim that the BCH nodes are not decentralised enough? Is there a metric available that measures this?
