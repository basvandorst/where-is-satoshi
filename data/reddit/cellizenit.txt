Not every employee would like to have this "internet money". And if someone wants cash, this cash needs to come from somewhere. This channel needs to get closed.

i think the channel needs to get closed/opened when you run out of funds. I dont think that alot of people can pay that much upfront just to use LN.
I think LN is only usefull if EVERYTHING is on LN, but its easier to just use a "better" crypto.

this is just plain wrong.
Imagine you buy every day a cheeseburger. Ofc MCDonalds needs to pay their employees, so they close the channel every week/whatever.
You cant just let the money sit idle in a statechannel. Something needs to get paid.
LN isnt the holy grail. Its just a solution for specific usecases.
99% of the users wont use LN, because they only transact like every month?

but how is the merchant paying their employees? What if they dont want "this stupid internet money" ? The merchant needs to cash out. 
Also the user needs to have permanently funds locked if they want to use everything. I dont think that alot of people can pay for their whole month upfront

yes, but mcdonalds still needs to close the channel to pay their employees. Also you can only transact as much as you have inside your state channel.

Hi guys, could you help me with segwit?
I understand that we just remove the signature from the transaction and store it inside another file (extension file).
Is it only a single extensionfile per block? Or an extension file for every transaction?
Why is segwit faster?

funfact: we already can create gold in a lab, but its way to expensive

this is just plain wrong.
The private key is the most important thing in crypto space

1. I cant get an GDAX account because i dont have a drivers ID or passport.
2. I cant move the funds from my coinbase wallet because it tells me "Wrong adress". I used legacy and segwit address but its still not working :(

i really expected a massive sell, but it looks like its a reverse

i have 55€ in btc on coinbase. I wanted to send it to my HW wallet. I first wanted to make a small test transaction to see if everything goes right...
but the fees are gigantic what the fuck. 4,70€ ? Is this always the case?

I always thought that you just count all incoming balances and subtract every outgoing balance and see how much you still have left and are able to spend

its important to note that there are no safety measures. If your bitcoin is gone, no one is gonna be able to put it back.
Be really really careful and read into the subject before sending bitcoins to a wallet. For now you are safe to hold it on an exchange, but once you cant afford to lose the money (because on an exchange you dont really own it!), you should switch to your own public key
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:13:18
it looks like they switch to "x2 bitcoin". But bitcoin and "x2 bitcoin" are not the same
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:16:28
honestly the best advice is to go on coinbase and buy some BTC.
Get a little bit BTC (like 10€ or whatever) and just try to do stuff with it. Send it to your own wallet, send it back. Make a cold storage etc etc.
Just so you get a feeling on how it works.

iam not a fan of the bitcoin.org sign.
The posters should be fun and no advertisement if you ask me
