You're going to get downvoted for this but I agree. Obviously you can back up everything on iPhones as well but people seem to have a harder time with it. And their locked out app store where pretty much everything costs money is ridiculous

There will never be a WW3. Nobody is that dumb. We are well beyond conventional warfare at that level. Plus with globalization we are far too interconnected economically so even an aggressor country wouldn't push for war.
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:30:23
Yeah but you're on reddit where nobody understand how the internet actually works.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:29:34
85 people is too many. At least one would fold and leak the information. "I was part of the Gox fiasco, AMA!"
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:35:12
And it will. Nobody is going to trust Gox ever again. They get screwed over completely. Yes, some people lost money in this but it was a risk we are all willing to take.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:22:59
That's the biggest hurdle. Most of my friends in their 20s and 30s couldn't handle the security side. I'm not even going to talk about my parents and their generation.

The thing is, international monetary policy isn't set by the mood or friendliness of a subreddit. Get over yourself.

This is a huge possibility.

I disagree with this. If it fails it doesn't hurt them at all (except for lost development cost)

While I don't disagree that there is a lot of stupid comments in here (OP's included) saying that it's 10x more likely to get stolen from CoinBase over newegg is ridiculous. Newegg is known to have had problems in the past with that sort of thing. Look at Target man.

I'm fully aware. It also means that he very well could have been employed by the government to run this project. I don't really think that he did, I think this is the wrong guy or a red herring.

This is the biggest takeaway. People on reddit that aren't into cryptocurrency don't realize that BTCs are thriving in the real world and outside of the Jamaican bobsled team, Doge is stuck on reddit.

Campaign finance laws wouldn't allow for that. There are limits to donations and you must disclose your information.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:44:21
If he took contributions from anonymous sources it would in fact break campaign finance law (so long as it's over $50 but it's kind of vague what that actually means). BTC is in nature, anonymous. The FEC would have a major issue with these donations, I can promise you that.

You couldn't be more right. Dogecoin has no real life and never will. People don't want to be "funny/silly/carefree" when it comes to real money. They're playing around with Dogecoin like it's Monopoly money where as BTC is serious.

This is counter intuitive to what BTC is about and if it becomes regulated by any government entity I'm out.
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:55:07


I'm not a financial planner/accountant or anything like that but yeah, this isn't too smart. I mean, even the biggest fan boy on will tell you that it's still a risky investment let alone diving in 100%.
But to your point, I'm not looking at it as a "retirement vehicle". Until Charles Schwab and the NYSE start taking bitcoins there's really no reason to "spend" them.
Your last sentence doesn't make sense. I can't start treating dining room tables like currency and if there is a limited supply of anything it's deflationary necessarily.
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:19:41
I have a question though. Banks and credit card companies enable us to transfer money. So my question is: What stops companies like Coinbase from becoming the new "bank"? We have to get money in and out of bitcoins and the only way to do that is through companies that need to make money etc. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:32:38
Thank you! Nobody sees this.


Yes, actually it can.
@_date: 2013-12-29 13:21:04
Exactly. This should come as no surprise to anyone. This comes from a guy who loves central banking, of course he's going to try to make it fail so he doesn't look bad and can sell more books. Bitcoin is the antithesis of his life work.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:08:11
Yes, sit through the presentations. This isn't cash, go learn.
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:12:32


You don't.


It is. The reason why everyone gets so heated about it is because nobody wants to believe they have been "duped". Someday we'll read that a small handful of people that created BTCs made tens of millions off of this. They've probably all sold by now and are waiting to watch it all burn.
Even if they didn't get "duped" it will never actually be a viable "currency" because nobody is treating it as such. BTCs will drop back down close to 1-1 against the USD. Most people will lose out anyway... Sure, some people will make a few hundred, perhaps even a few thousand but the point is, a VAST majority of the people are going to lose money. Especially the late adopters.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:55:50
This...and every reply is looking at BTC as a commodity, which it is not.
@_date: 2013-03-04 20:20:48

@_date: 2013-03-04 23:29:17
Sorry, that last post was from work. Basically, I'm never going to spend *all* of my USD because I'll keep working and earning money. Once I retire, I'll spend my retirement savings.
Nobody is sitting on BTC and not meeting their needs. They are spending other forms of currency to meet needs and hoping they will get rich quick off of BTCs.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:42:32
I would say once you hit a certain saturation point. I don't know how many people or what percentage that is but we aren't there yet. Most laymen can't create a wallet and safely encrypt it.
@_date: 2013-03-04 20:06:20
There are not nearly enough people involved in BTCs with economic backgrounds. I've come to learn that very quickly since I decided to investigate. You've got mostly techies trying to create something the .gov can't track (insert whatever here ____________). The problem is that they are treating a currency like a commodity. They think supply and demand is the most important thing with their wrongly labeled commodity. They don't realize that the US Federal Reserve controls far more in the global economy than they think. They think that the solution to deflation is having more than two decimal places (by the way, deflation isn't necessarily a good thing because inflation is a bad thing). 
**tl;dr** Not enough economic/business minded people behind BTCs.
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:29:03
That's because USD has been used for a long ass time and is fully backed by the US Treasury. Cash is controlled by you and I and the USG.

You're assuming I'm going to spend all of my USD. Your assumption doesn't make any sense. The USD is actually losing value, spend it quick. The BTC is gaining "value", hang onto it. This discourages spending.

What you just said went over the heads of 90% of potential Bitcoin users. That's the problem.
@_date: 2013-03-04 22:15:03

Seven percent against BTC.
That's a lot more fluctuation.

@_date: 2013-12-24 15:40:34
That's exactly my point though. What is stopping Coinbase from becoming the "banks" we don't like today? The problem I see is that there needs to be an "easy way" for transactions to process for the non-technical masses.

Yeah, that's me. I knew about them at $30 and thought that was a high price and that it would come back down. Said the same thing at $200.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:12:27
The sentiment of the OP is that this will be different and I don't disagree. But just because they aren't doing it now doesn't mean that Coinbase isn't going to be bought out by a bank or other financial institution. Nothing is stopping Coinbase from becoming the institutions that we're trying to get away from now.
