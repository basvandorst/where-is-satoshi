I don't understand your point.  Its not economically viable?  They can easily team up with manufacturers of phones, and PCs, and even appliances by teaming with companies like GE, to put their chips in everything world wide.

I think its a trick.  They have huge funding.  Imagine they team up with Android phone/iphone and PC manufacturers to put their chips in EVERYTHING world wide.  That is billions of chips in every device.  It would create a giant Bitcoin botnet that they control.  They could even amass enough hashing power to control the entire network.  Most people do not like Bitcoin, but they like their PCs and smartphones.  These billions of people could be being hijacked for a giant botnet.  How else could you justify the amount of funding this secretive startup has gotten?

Just because they say that is their intention, it doesn't mean they are being honest.  I think its possible they are trying to team up with manufacturers of phones, PCs, and even regular appliances to put their chips in EVERYTHING.  Then they will control billions of chips around the world and they won't even need to pay electricity.  They could potentially control a majority of hashing power and use it to usurp control over Bitcoin in the long run.  They did receive tons of money, and it is not justified.  But if they are planning what I think they are planning, then it certainly is justified and would be particularly interesting to the establishment powers that be.

Yeah you don't know how powerful they will be in the future, also don't forget to multiply that by potentially 50 or 100 billion devices and appliances worldwide.

Or just censor anyone who questions anything.  Oh wait.  This device sounds like complete bullshit.  I can't believe people are falling for this.

If they can make their chips powerful enough and get them in enough devices worldwide, it seems like a real threat.  They would be using billions of people who may not even know or care about Bitcoin, and act as a parasite on them mining Bitcoin.  Its like a giant Botnet.

Ethereum has some good tech that has been forked into various projects.  However the funding round and presale they had seemed pretty immoral if not illegal.  A lot of investors got scammed and are going to lose their money.
Also I don't know how this and other ethereum posts are allowed in this sub, when Gavin and Mike's fork is not even allowed to be discussed because its an "alt-coin".  What hypocrisy.
Here you go:  @_date: 2015-09-22 01:46:02
I am unbiased.  I worry that its a secret plan for a giant Bitcoin botnet by teaming up with manufacturers to put their chips in billions of devices worldwide.  They control the mining on the chips, not the users.  So 21 inc may become the majority hashing power in control of Bitcoin.  Hope I am wrong though.

Could it be a secret plan to put all of their chips in billions of devices worldwide by partnering with phone, PC, or appliance manufacturers?  This would create a giant Bitcoin botnet.  I think its important to realize that 21 inc has said they will be in control of the chips using some clever tech.  The users won't be in control.  Isn't there a danger that they could become the majority hashing power and use it to gain significant control over the Bitcoin network?  They did receieve many millions in funding and they were pretty secretive until recently.  I think we should worry.
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:13:25
and what is their monetization scheme?
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:01:48
I am trying to keep an open-mind.  But this seems like it could be a giant scam, or an attempt to put chips in everything to create a giant botnet in the future to control Bitcoin.  I just don't understand the need to mine with this "bitcoin computer".  They say it is to "provide continuous liquidity into the system"?  Could someone explain this in more detail?? It seems like BS to me, but am really hoping I am wrong.
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:11:48
Could you elaborate what things it could enable?  What is the point of mining with the chips? Its not mining significant amounts of Bitcoin.  Then they have some weird line like its "just to provide liquidity into the system".  Now I could be wrong, but it seems that this quote is very vague and weird and does not make any sense at all. Do you worry that it could be a secret plan to put their chips in billions of devices worldwide in order to create a giant Bitcoin botnet?  They could use it to mine a lot of Bitcoin, or even to control Bitcoin with the majority of hashing power.  This company seems to have a lot of funding behind it.  
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:12:55
You must have forgot that Bitcoin transactions require mining fees.
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:28:00
Yeah it seems like a giant Botnet, infecting billions of people with their chips.  Its a real danger to Bitcoin.  I just made a thread about it a minute ago, but its being censored.  Possibly it will be approved by mods in the next hour.
