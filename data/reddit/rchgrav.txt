Did you watch the video demonstrating the M-Disk media durability?.   Sure, a DVD is excessive to store a small wallet.dat file, but its pretty inexpensive when you consider its a total cost of $60, $30 burner  plus $30 for 10 blank m-discs  If your ultimate goal would be for a family member who gets this DVD from safety deposit box to be able to retrieve the bitcoins, encrypt the wallet.dat w/ the built in pass phrase encryption found in the core bitcoin wallet, and possibly fill the rest of the DVD with a few thousand family photos to use up the rest of the space.  You could have the pass phrase stored separately in a completely different document w/ a trusted 3rd party, or the family lawyer.  Maybe you could hide the pass phrase deep within the family photos in a picture.  It all depends how difficult you want the process to be to retrieve the coins, and how many secrets need to be combined to access them. Be creative, write clear instructions on how to access the bitcoins on the DVD with the wallet.dat, include bitcoin software, but don't be so clear about the password, or even that there is a password in the instructions with the wallet.dat file..  Have that be separated somehow if that is a concern.. but don't be so tricky that no one in the family is ever able to get the coins either.

I was actually thinking this as being likely as I was creating the post about IPv6.. the bitpay-paypal thing is too much of a coincidence.  I agree with your guess.  In this instance, where would the security hole exist to allow this type of DNS cache poisoning occur?   I understand  what DNS cache poisoning is, but I'm not clear what hole would be open for someone to inject the records into the DNS.  Would they be spoofing an upstream server when a lookup occured?.  ...  The poisoned records should expire with the TTL, but they could keep doing this if someone didn't fix their issue. How does an attacker typically accomplish this kind of thing.. wouldn't this need to be man in the middle between DNS servers?  I don't want the same thing to happen to any of my DNS servers.

Definitely, multiple backups are smart thinking.. you should consider using different media types.  I like the ironkey because it has a built in backup solution which exports an encrypted backup in case the drive is lost.  I use the version with SLC NAND, not the MLC.  Speaking of multiple media types, its prudent to point out is that typical optical media (CD-R, DVD-R) have a limited lifespan because the dye's that hold the 1's and 0's actually decays and rots over time.. Many of my disks I burned long ago are unreadable. I have been using "DVD-M" media, it is more akin to etching 1's and 0's into stone, the burned disc's can be read on ANY reader, and the media DOES NOT succumb to bit rot. (It's specified to last for 1000 years!!)  I think most of LG's new optical drives support M-Disk, or check drive support @   The disks are about $3ea in a pack of 10.

Copay is cool, but is it cold?  What happens if Copay's site disappears or something else... It would be great if there was a service like this that would allow the user to hold their own private keys and better yet the company providing the service had no access to them.  If Copay closes shop does the original user have a way to retain or recover the private keys without copay's blessing and assistance?  (Any BTC storage plan beyond a short time frame or small amount of value should have a TNO approach in my mind.)  I'm asking because I don't know...  It would be very cool if they did do it this way..

That image was originally computer generated as the most common face in the world, the algorithm which generated it used a statistically accurate sampling of all races and faces on the planet but tends towards asian... well because I think there is a lot of them...

This is the first parody song we tried to make, or any song for that matter...  As long as people get a good laugh we are happy.  If anyone mentioned in the song cant take a joke, then whatever.

Not immediately, but you can buy back after 30 days.   Tax Loss Selling makes sense..  I think we are looking at mid January until the rain clouds over BTC's head start to clear up and give way to some sunny days, and clear moonlit nights.

Here is a shot in the dark... Just wondering if you looked into IPv6 and if its enabled on your router, or if you are routing IPv6 traffic.  I had a similar issue, not exactly with SSL, but where some sites were doing some strange things but other sites were just fine.  I didn't dig deep into the issue, but the common symptom was that it was effecting various devices on my network, including iPhone and other devices.  After some searching on the net I stumbled upon the issue being related to IPv6, possibly name resolution issues and / or a routing issue and disabling it in my router resolved the issue.

OK.. I looked a little deeper, and it seems that it is done this way.  Personally I would need to still figure out how the safety deposit box version of this would work.  It also assumes that all of your Copayers are computer savvy enough to retain their own private keys to sign the transactions and read / follow the instructions for backing up their browser local storage and recovering local browser storage in the case of a new PC or system crash.  I could just imagine a situation where a couple copayers aren't tech savvy and accidentally lose their copay wallet.. and even though you backed up yours.. you lost access to your BTC.  This is a great idea though.. I'm just thinking through how this works for cold storage.  I'm liking the K.I.S.S. method of cold storage offline w/ good digital media and a semi strong password I think is still the best way for me. :-)

I just decided to try Purse.io for the first time today..  I'm not sure I'm yet receiving what I was bargaining for here. My order of my $555.11 prime item was accepted instantly but after 9 hours has yet to get processed...  I also only received $27.76 and not the $55.51 I was expecting.  I was a good sport and fulfilled a few users requests for items when I checked in throughout the day.. but my discount hasn't been adjusted, and my delivery date is N/A.  Hopefully they will see this message and fix me up.

The answer is very easy because It's shown in the photograph, clearly marked as the "Private Key", so asking for the private key could be answered honestly and correctly by saying "6PfMAxHfWMH5LK7GekKuG2cxNUCnsFFCZdq8Q9CxQiAw9qyR1mQVdutJ1g" however its useless because its BIP38 encrypted...  If you could actually get an answer to one question, asking specifically for the non-encrypted private key would be a better question.... or asking for the passphrase to private key shown in the photo would be a good question too.   For the BIP38 uninitiated  -&gt;

No, No, No.. you've got it all wrong... The only money you could steal with 50% of the computing power would be transactions you could submit to the current block.. ie. bitcoins you actually hold.. By releasing a more valid block, you could invalidate the weaker one, Thus reverting only those transactions... A further complication is the limit of time you have to release the stronger blocks, and continually produce stronger blocks than the rest of the network. You opportunity to perform this attack is limited to the rest of the network accepting the current block as valid. If you orchestrated this attack by co-ordinating a transfer of your own bitcoins within that block, you could theoretically revert them back to your wallet.  It would currently take approximately 1 Th/s to accomplish this hack, which if I remember correctly is greater than the 500 most powerful supercomputers COMBINED.. There is only one time this has EVER occured when deepbit hit 50% for a very short period based upon their popularity at the time, the miners jumped pools almost instantly.  Deepbit is still the largest pool, but it now only controls about 25% of the bitcoin networks processing power... The fact is that this "theoretical vulnerability" could never be profitable under any realistic set of circumstances due to the nature of the way this vulnerability works, and certainly COULD NOT transfer your bitcoins from your wallet.  And you could only really profit by the number of bitcoins you actually hold... in the end its not a realistic hack... only a fun way to contest it is possible to perform a hack on the bitcoin protocol.

If you are really intent on running mining software you can find a good tutorial for running cgminer on Windows 7..  From the perspective of the OS the mining software itself should run exactly the same way on Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1..  cgminer compiled for Windows 7 should run on Windows 8.1.  Honestly though you will need a USB ASIC miner to go along with that to even achieve 1/1000000 of a bitcoin.  Another option would be to pick up an inexpensive ASIC based miner like an Antminer S3 on eBay... it will mine many thousands of times faster then the CPU in even the fastest computer, cgminer is built in so it can run independently of your PC.  Just throwing it this info your way, hopefully its helpful.

This is the only I have ever heard of any thing like this and sadly the first time I have ever wanted to ask merchant to STOP accepting Bitcoin.   Although I guess this is possible, but it almost feels like a staged example to illustrate how some merchants may react to transacting in a volatile currency.  Does anyone know which coffee shop this was and if they actually require a minimum $25 charge?!  If so this merchant isn't protecting from volatility, he is amplifying it for himself... I think its more likely (if this was real) that the guy is just a greedy %$ who either just doesn't "get it", or just trying to get coinrich.
