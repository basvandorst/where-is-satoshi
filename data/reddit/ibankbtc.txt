No 2FA mentioned, sounds like a mistake on ur part. Coinbase can't stop ur account from getting scammed if they got key logger in ur email

Did you say privacy?
"You need to identify yourself with your SSN only if you want to pay your taxes. This is because they need to directly pay your taxes for you."

wait, hold on a second. 2% fee is a lot to buy something. Why bother when I can use a CC and actually get 1% CB. I also get chargeback service and fraud protection.
The whole point of bitcoins is to have low transaction fee structure, this defeats the purpose lol.

Knowing that you are a derivative trader, you surely must have read Jesse Livermore's book, what do you think about the manipulation back during his time compared to now? Are some of his methods still used today?
It is clear in his book that manipulation could last weeks/month and not the short-lived on the 5 minute chart you described. Thanks.

I don't understand, please explain.
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:30:48
AH!, thanks. Maybe I'll do a post there tomorrow and see.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:50:50
are you guys hiring? The job description of each job is a dead link for some reason.

If there is a t-shirt version, I would be all over it!

I deposited some BTC into circle, how do I sell my BTC without having to transfer it to my bank?
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:22:52
no, but I did set aside a fund in case I lost some coins. Then make a note that I lost money lol
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:34:46
np, msg here and i'll try again when you are done.

I went to check out and I live in the CA, in US.


Could you double check if it ships to US?
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:44:55
Looks good, which razor would you recommend, the revenge or the chrome? I don't know the difference. Also do you ship to the US?

Active trader here and in What you said is not entirely true, they did compensate people who were qualified and it wasn't just from the time frame of "17:00 and 17:19 on 10 July", I received a 15% of my BTC, my forced liquidation was 17:22. I know many who have received it as well.
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:51:31
They look good, bought. Plan to buy more if GF likes them. Thanks
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:03:39
it is true, multiple instances of electrum, same seed = same address. If you have different address, you have made a mistake some where in the recovery process.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:19:01
It is much more comfortable to buy on the way up then down.

booking.com accepts bitocin? didn't know that. I think all sites are for hotel bookings only, not flights.

Today my confirmations have been spotty between my wallets, circle and coinable. I used 0.0003 BTC fees which is way above what it is usually. Frustrating.

Even if you don't have 51% of speed, you could potentially win 2 blocks back to back. The blockchain is cheated for the time being until the next block come in to confirm that it is false?

From all the loans you gave out, what % of it defaulted? What rating was the most frequent defaulters. Since those ratings doesn't actually connect to a real credit score, I am doubtful of a working credit system.
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:13:55
Nice catch
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:00:19
I am afraid that 3mil is his diversified portfolio lol.
@_date: 2015-09-30 10:20:35
Equity only? Well that is expecting a lot. I recommend get some funding from your amazing model, hire and pay people to code your trading system. There are already systems that offer automated trading. Why not start from that. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 19:23:34
actively trading that money, no doubt.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:59:19
nah, you can buy high and sell higher.
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:12:56
Can't speak if it profits others, I personally do, I also short the lows and buy back lower. My tract record:

Move on, nothing to read here. You can't have insurance, and no clawback.

Hello CEO Star Xu:
Could you take a look at the calculation method for your futures index? The exchange rate seems to be off by about 1%. I made a post from bitcoinmarkets here 
Your exchange rate for futures index is about 6.12 RMB to USD, while bank of china (according to your FAQ is the bank of china's 9:30 AM CST rate) is at 6.25 RMB to USD.
This discrepency causes the settlement price to increase by about 1%. If I were to use 20x margin at settlement, my gain is off by 20%. 
Thanks for reading.
