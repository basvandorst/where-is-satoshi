Honest question: How/Why are Segwit transactions faster? 
 - Do your segwit transactions have higher sat/byte fee (but have fewer bytes so the total fee is lower)?
 - Do miners lower sat/byte fees on segwit to promote segwit (sacrificing their own profit)?
 - Something else?

Valve (or a third party merchant-services company) could mine bitcoin. They could choose to include transactions to Valves wallets with low or zero fees. As long as they mined blocks fast enough and the block reward was great enough they could still profit.

I don't have an opinion for or against the specifics of RBF, but I like the idea of changing the fee you are willing to pay for  a specific transaction, as long as the recipient receives the same amount.


What are you worried about signaling?


What do you mean by this? Do you mean that a node should allow mempool replacement without a signal flag? Or are you concerned that RBF allows inputs and outputs to be changed?

Isn't this what replace-by-fee is for?

Crypto is closer to Anarchy. If 49% (or even 1%) disagree with a decision they are free to fork and follow their own will. The community is obviously incentivized to stay together, but as we saw this week the option is there to split.

As RHavar said - this site is not provably fair.
The client only receives the server seed hash after providing the unhashed client seed to the server.
    POST api.lightningspin.com/users/seed
    {uuid: "bcc9e2a5-6cb1-43ec-8a05-1d46fc55b52e"}
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {"serverSeed":"a3144ec39c3002d6fbc9a63e7e0efdaa4fd1018254ecc5d306b6d206f5135c1d","previousSeed":{"seed":"bd5ead001e00b839df0ff1dc300fe64908d696b146495c5e62edf2eb75619e3e","hash":"eccf12aa8a25835f34bf3413662fdb03a4248fd394479a96cc8d0348cd724d6d"}}
uuid in the post body is the client seed. The server could try many serer seeds and select one with high returns.
Allowing a user to select their own client seed *is not enough to make this provably fair!*. The server must commit to a secret seed *before* it knows the client seed. If the client seed is editable, it must be editable *after* receiving a server hash.
I'm not going to play any rolls so I can't check myself, has anyone verified  their rolls by hand using the [provably fail]( algorithm?
provably fair hits that different dice sites implement slightly different algos, it would be nice if lightning spin specified which algorithm it uses. I think it would be a good idea to 'show your work' and have the site display step by step roll verification.
If I understand correctly, I have to deposit money into lightning spin. I can use deposited money to gamble, and later withdraw it.
Why should I trust Lightning Spin to let me withdraw? How do I know they haven't setup the site to shutdown as soon as they reach some threshold in users wallets so they can walk away rich.
Why do I need to deposit a balance instead of paying as I go?
(unless the balance is a lightning channel balance?)

I'm not doubting you **the following is a fun exercise in paranoia.**
Could the paper hosted at  be an altered version even tho blockchair has validated that it is the original?
 bitcoin.org is selectively serving an altered paper.
bitcoin.org is serving an altered whitepaper to some users, and the original to others. blockchair receives the original paper from bitcoin.org and duitifully reports that the hash matches the original. bitcoin.org evaluates visitors using browser fingerprinting. A visitor that may detect the alterations is sent the original while rubes are be sent an altered copy.
 all bitcoin whitepapers on blockchair are altered
All bitcoin.pdf's listed on blockchair, and the blockchain hosted version they link to are the same altered version. Maybe the original was altered before it was widely propagated and we are all mistaken. Maybe an adversary controls blockchair, bitcoin.org, and the other sites linked from blockchair
The on-chain evidence that blockchair provides to support their copy of the whitepaper only dates back to 2013, when the paper was drafted on 2009-03-24
 - The blockchain transaction containing the pdf was created on 2013-04-06, four years later.
 -  The earliest null-data output containing the hash as plaintext was created on 2015-12-23
Is there a copy of the paper signed by Satoshi? Another fun experiment - what is satoshi's public key? If someone wanted to lie to you about his keys how could you prove them wrong?
tl;dr - I don't know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:32:41
Yeah, I'm actually really surprised that the earliest blockchain hash was created in 2013, and that there isn't a satoshi signature verifying the hash of the paper.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:07:51
The whitepaper does a better job explaining the ideas behind blockchains than any of the 'intro to blockchain' blogs that I have read.
Anyone should be able to read till section *11. Calculations* regardless of their background.

 - How trivial would it be to fork Bitcoin to raise the total coin limit? 
 - What percent of current block rewards are transaction fees?
 What conditions will allow bitcoin to be mined for profit as the block reward goes to 0?  
 My assumptions:
 1. We expect more people adopt Bitcoin.
 2.  The block difficulty adjustment algorithm will keep the block generation rate consistent, at 6 per hour.
 3. The maximum number of transactions per block is strongly correlated to block size and will remain consistent unless block size changes.
 4. Mining reward is equals approximately `daily miner income = (minted coins + average transaction fee * block total value) * blocks per day`
 5. A valuable transaction and a a cheep transaction consume the same size in a block.
 Thoughs:
2 and 3 seem problematic already - they imply that there is a a maximum transaction confirmation rate. If we are already creating 1mb blocks then I assume we are close to that limit today.
4 is interesting, once all coins are minted the reward per block equals `average transaction fee * block total value`. Mining will be profitable if **(a) transaction fees are high enough** or **(b) blocks are valuable enough.** **(a)** is simple enough, miners can choose to include transactions with satisfactory fees while customers decide how much they are willing to pay. **(b)** is weirder. The block size limit is indirectly a block transaction count limit. A block's value is correlated to the average value of the transactions in it. A blocks value can only be raised by including more valuable transactions. Miners would be discouraged from including small transactions. If the minimum acceptable transaction size is high enough it will exclude 'normal' daily transactions, the proverbial cup of coffee. At world scale it could exclude your credit card payment, your rent and most individual's needs.
 Conclusion:
After block reward reaches 0 todays bitcoin protocol could only be mined profitabl if most transactions are large - a settlement network - because there is a maximum transaction confirmation rate.
The rate could be raised by increasing block size, or block creation rate, or a protocol change (like segwit)
tl;dr - I don't know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:20:11
My logic applies to small block rewards in addition to 0 block rewards. When is `cost to mine &gt; reward`?

The coins will exist, at the same address, in each fork. Since any transaction you create will be broadcast to _both_ forks*, the transaction will be included in blocks on either fork if it is considered valid.
So if you want to send a coin to me, you will probably send coins from each fork to me in each fork.
As the forks become more out of sync with each other (for whatever reasons caused the hard fork in the first place) it becomes more likely that a transaction that is valid in one chain will _not_ be valid in the other. Then the transaction will only be included in one fork, causing the forks to diverge more.
* assuming that the cause of the fork doesn't affect peering or cause the network to split...
