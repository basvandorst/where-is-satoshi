Some people don't seem to understand the inherent risk of NOT investing

This is a pretty terrible time to sell fyi.

My analysis based on all prior price prediction trends it's always way higher than the predicted value. So if this guy thinks it's $55k that means it will be 100k

What does that even mean? Overpriced relative to the actual market. If it's priced at something thats the market value is it not? How do you determine if something is overvalued or undervalued? If bitcoin was 10k 3 months ago would be overvalued? Why what's the difference. Maybe bitcoin is undervalued and that it's "correcting" to it's true value which in the hundreds of thousands

consider buying litecoin then.

Yes i get it, it has developers. But how do you go about changing bitcoin? If you can change it how is it decentralized? How do people agree on changes?

It's not. 
Sending bitcoin from coinbase to an exchange is however more costly than using litecoin.
What i usually do is buy litecoin from coinbase, send to binance or bittrex. Sell that litecoin for bitcoin, and then buy whatever alts i was looking to buy.

Dude looks like a murderer

shit i'd alteast keep one or 2 esspecially right now. Seems alot of big money will be coming into bitcoin very soon.

Doesn't the real satoshi have a ton of bitcoin locked up somewhere?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:38:19
still cheaper than ea

For some reason it doesn't work for me. Whenever I try to purchase it actually says it's confirmed the transaction but then nothing ever shows up. No charges were made to my account and there are no pending transactions.

Guy lost all credibility when he compared iota to bitconnect.
Don't understand why people listen to this twitter know it all
