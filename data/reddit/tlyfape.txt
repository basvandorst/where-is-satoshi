You are incredibly disingenuous. It hasn't made any significant inroads in terms of practical use. Regarding the stability of the currencies, it's not honest to suggest they don't hinge upon the possibilities of international politics, really. 


Bitcoin in particular? I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone make a genuine argument as to why **bitcoin** is the future.


I'd like a meaningful discussion, but all I get around here are people sniffing their own farts. *Bitcoin* isn't the future. *Digital currencies* are, **obviously**.

Never said they weren't. 


Paypal has been ubiquitous for a decade. 2000 is calling - wants to know if you ever ebay'd? Bitcoin is definitely interesting. I think for a variety of reasons it wont make it *too* far. One of which might be threatened gov't's. More likely is bitcoin's own technical design which favors large institutions willing to invest in computing power. Or the one guy that probably owns most of the market ducking out. 


I'm not referring to the market cap. I don't think bitcoin's market cap is directly related to it's ability to be practically used in typical transactions. Sure, it's an influencing factor, but I think the obvious technical limitations are greater prohibitors, otherwise that 1 billion market cap would've dissolved them away at this point.

Nope. Not like that ever dissuaded anyone from the 'revolution' around here

What you don't get is that the real world isn't theoretical, it's real.
Theory doesn't aid practicality in this context. Your political preferences don't affect a small business owner's transactional ability. Your political preferences don't affect a small business owner's interest in using bitcoin as a very temporary dollar because paypal charges 6%. What matters there is that there is no reliable service for such a thing. 
It's obvious this is your problem seeing as you bothered to send such a response towards me.

Why aren't people incessantly posting about how bitcoin is the future currency in **this** thread??
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:44:22
What's with the over-the-top revolutionary attitudes of every post in when the reality is **so much** less dramatic?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:43:20


Oh, well that settles it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:41:25
if you don't want to read about bitcoin's design allowing for unscrupulous businesses, you probably shouldn't read about bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:27:34
Well with the kind of thought put into ideas like this it's no wonder that you have invested in bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:14:48


Geez, if you could turn those into bitcoins you might have *something* of value. 


Really dude. Work on the reading comprehension. That's my point. Tired of all the constant circle-jerkers that act like the fact that a halal-kart decided to accept bitcoins means that the dollar is dunzo. 


I'd actually appreciate it if you guys realized just how damn slowly you were actually moving. 


Not interested in turning my U$D into a form of temporary U$D that is somehow even more volatile than the (much maligned) U$D. I'll stick with investments that aren't obviously [pump and dump schemes](

massive disadvantages for the buyer
but yeah, buying a bitcoin mining rig with bitcoins. the revolution *sure is* here
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:24:18
I'd work on that reading comprehension as I suggested *no* such thing ;)
It's the same as the idea that bitcoin will eventually stabalize (when, exactly??). Completely opposite contemporary evidence and lacking any substance to support the long-term notion. 
It's a currency for the future if you prefer never-ending volatility, a complete lack of actual relevant functions, and a level of anonymity that guarantees you can't trust *anyone* you trade the currency with.

I live in a large city. Not a single thing I encountered yesterday I could've bought with bitcoins. It will be the same today. Yes, there are places in this city that *do* accept bitcoin. It's just that, I don't only make purchases at 'forward thinking' lunch trucks. This is a great case for you mistaking theory with practice again. Yes, moneyexchangers help bitcoin, they just don't do much to help *me* (or anyone else) use bitcoin. 
I mean, am I to think you aren't disingenuous when you suggest that only *some* real estate can't be purchases with bitcoins? 


Now now, who suggested they were? It's just the type of stability *bitcoin* would never be able to achieve. 


I never claimed to know a better one, but all I see with bitcoin are significant drawbacks that prevent it from being adopted by regular people for regular usage. And I don't see anyone critical of those drawbacks. What I see are people that pretend they don't exist and act like you can significantly use bitcoin in your daily life. I'd really work on that reading comprehension as you constantly misunderstand my point. I mean, are you suggesting that because there is *one* place in this world that exchanges bitcoins for groceries, that that problem is solved?


Hmmmm, I'll take a curmudgeon over a fool. You seemed like you were realistic up until your rant on how there isn't much you can't buy with bitcoin.
