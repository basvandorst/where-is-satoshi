read again. where am i promoting or even mentioning it?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:28:04
Its a valid question. If you don’t know the answer, at least don’t be a jackass. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:08:02
Sorry. I meant to say Steve Wozniack, not Jobs. Wozniack cared about early employees of Apple and gave them away most of his shares when there was an early dispute. He certainly fits the profile. 
Bill Gates is an amazing programmer and as we’ve learned since he retired from Microsoft, he is more dedicated to helping the world than he is about capitalism. 
And Elon Musk is a crazy workaholic who is also a kickass programmer. He also has the financial with Paypal. Perhaps Bitcoin is what he always intended for Paypal to be.

Woz is one of my top-3 candidates for being Satoshi Nakamoto. 1. Smart programmer 2. Not motivated by money 3. Apprehensive about fame or recognition. 4. Genuine interest for making the world a better place. 
Very few people in the world fit that profile.

I agree with most of your reasoning. It doesn’t take away the fact that videos like this reflect poorly on everybody. Really, the complain is less against you and more against the mods who are selective about what can and cannot be discussed here. If they allow this, they should also allow intelligent discussions about the technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:15:33
I think Satoshi is a single individual, not a group of people. 
The coins are still in circulation, even if he is not around anymore. Someone as smart as this person would not take the private keys to his grave. When someone starts moving these coins, the value of bitcoin will drop as many people consider them to be lost forever. The impact will likely be short term, though. 
This person is clearly not motivated by money, so its likely to be someone very wealthy who is passionate about technology and changing the world. My candidates: Elon Musk, Steve Wozniack and Bill Gates. 
Edit: A previous version of this post had Steve Jobs instead of Steve Wozniack as a candidate.

Posts like this reflect very poorly on our community. 
What are the mods thinking? When one tries to have a serious discussion about the flaws of bitcoin and what we can do to improve, one gets banned. But insulting posts like this one get through. Im no fan of Roger Ver, and I think he is very toxic for the entire crypto community. But the mods in here are no better. If you read this, you are lucky. It will be removed in 3...2...1..
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:05:14
ohh thank you. By insulting me you are proving my point. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:51:34
i dont know whether to upvote or downvote your comment. 1000% gains is unsustainable. But so is 13.5%. You and I are lucky to have started out investing in the stock market when we did. There hasnt been a correction since 2009. But, it is coming!  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:05
What makes you think I would suggest that? I just have a problem with the entitlement implied in “my efforts”. 
Im just suggesting broader adoption will not be achieved by a culture of hodling. Spend and benefit from your Satoshis. Thats all. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:28:58
what efforts? unless you contributed to the code, or educated others on blockchain technology, you simply got luckier than others who don’t even know about bitcoin yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:27:03
I don’t. Thats exactly my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:26:52
where in the world do you get the idea that I’m advocating for socialism? I’m not even against hodling. I think its creating a culture of saving which is better than the alternative. I’m just calling BS on the hypocrisy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:30:59
So, we’ve resorted to insults. what makes you think I don’t hodl myself? the fact that I point out the hypocrisy in the claims?

Real estate is the safest investment? What year do you live in? 2006?

I have been debt free in the past, and I’ll tell you what. Paying 2.75% on a 30 yr loan, while making much more via investments and crypto feels even better. Its almost free money.  The banking system needs reforms, but it also works in your favor if you know how to play the game!
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:37:02
We are better than this. every comment in the other channel is against bitcoin. Are we going to use this channel just to trash them too? c’mon guys, grow up!
edit: typo
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:36:33
True. but 2.5% does not even cover inflation. If you get that rate, much better to invest it elsewhere. Chances of making less than that are very slim. Definitely a good risk/reward ratio. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:33:12
Im a BTC supporter but we must admit there is a problem. The political struggles within the BTC devs are slowing innovation. We claim the network is more secure than others but as a user this is pointless. The network does not have to be the most secure, just secure enough. Otherwise, we’d all store our money in Ft. Knox and not on a local branch.

Absolutely Not! The guy wants attention, and CNBC wants ratings. if you call, they both win. Simply stop watching CNBC. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:55:52
So, how do you really feel?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:49:37
One can be emotional about money, one can be smart about it, or be both. I don’t like the idea of BCH, the people behind, or pretty much anything about it. I hope it fails miserably. That said, I am holding 1-to-1 BTC-BCH until the whole  thing settles. One shall not underestimate the power of marketing, manipulation, or investor stupidity.

Not sure why everyone thinks I’m advocating for free meals. Provide something of value and I will gladly send my Satoshis.

@_date: 2018-02-15 02:26:33
Agree to disagree. Bitcoin risks becoming the new MySpace. I’ve worked in technology my entire life and  innovation waits for nobody. Fast &gt; Perfect. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:46:46
Ohh, C’mon! .  Lets admit 99.99% of us dont give a rat’s ass about the ideology. the earlier we admit, the better. I use banks to finance a lifestyle I cannot afford, and I invest in crypto to be able to afford it. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:26:15
I know you are being funny. Either way, the regulation is nebulous but the advice from my tax lawyer (who specializes in crypto) is to treat forks as a new asset with a cost basis of zero. Sucks, I know, but thats what you gotta do if you want to be safe. Anything else, you are risking future audits and tax liabilities. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:06:54
I support BTC but I disagree. We must admit the  governance system is broken. Bitcoin needs a system where good ideas are promoted and innovation happens quickly. Otherwise, it is susceptible to another technology who can innovate and improve faster. The challenge is doing it while maintaining descentralization. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:52:59
maybe the opposite. Im in it for the money and I am buying. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:53:39
You clearly have little to no work experience. Unless you are a top executive, most of us have little control over the general direction of a company. The larger the company the harder to steer. Silver lining is that if you are part of a sinking ship and understand why something fails, you can learn a lot from it.  Those experiences have allowed me to succeed in several startups since. So yes, I do know a thing or two about technology and innovation.

If taxes are fraud, who is going to build the roads to drive your lambos on? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:51:21
I was a programmer at Kodak and PMO at Blockbuster. So yes. I know what I’m talking about. Being a worldwide leader or having first movers advantage means jack when you can’t innovate fast enough. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:52:54
Keep your head buried in the sand. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:02:11
okay. Woz was on my short list of potential Satoshi Nakamoto’s. 
1. Smart programmer 2. Not motivated by money 3. Avert to the spotlight.  3. Genuinely wanting to make the world a better place. 
His own concept of happiness disqualifies him. Im crossing him off after reading the interview.. 
Still on the list. 1. Elon Musk, 2. Bill Gates
