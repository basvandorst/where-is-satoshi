I dont know, I just used the suggested fee of the blockchain.info wallet... 0,0001243 btc.
I guess that is what most people do.
@_date: 2016-08-19 07:56:50
This is the transaction. I don't think anything is wrong... maybe this is the new normal? The size of btc transferred is not very low, it has the suggested fee... what else would the normal user do?
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:53:26
Because I did not know that THIS was the problem when I posted the thread.
Why do you blame the wallet when you know about the block time variation?
@_date: 2016-08-19 12:27:26
Thanks, that makes sense... it was very unusual for me so I thought that my transactions might be stuck in the mempool or something.

What kind of problem? Everything is good on my end. It's just that the confirmations are soooooooooooo slow. A year ago it wasn't like that.
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:39:15
It was not the problem of the wallet, it was a bitcoin problem. There were no blocks until 50 minutes after I sent my funds. No wallet in the world could have changed that.

I was not talking about forks anymore ;)

If by "wasting blockspace" you mean "using the currency" - yes, people could finally do that again. Until LN arrives it should lighten the load a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:46:57
Job? Inheritance? Maybe both.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:15:35
Or... you know... we could optimize BTC so that it can be used as currency again, as it was always intended. Crazy, I know...

Segwit has been on testnet for ages - and that is also where development of LN happens.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:20:04
Well the core devs don't do anything about that right now, they sit on their hands and wait for LN. So no, obviously there are not enough topics about the congested network.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:25:04
Yes, LN will be very centralized. Did Blockstream not tell you? Oh.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:23:21
But then your channel can't open. I have had a transaction with $6 fee for 8 days in the mempool now - do you want your channel to remain in the mempool?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:48:34
Awesome, but with the high fees we have right now not really worth it to buy anything.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:40:41
Sure, and I am not suggesting to abandon it - if it really works on a large scale then it is really good technology. That is still a big if and it will still be a long time until we *all* can use it. The problem is that our blocks are full already, so we need to do something about that *right now* and not in a year.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:45:45
Your insults are pretty low from someone who claims to be in the right. Pretty pathetic honestly, because you are wrong.


OK then answer this question: From Jan 3rd until today, how many sat/B would you have to put into your transaction to be processed within the next block? What is a decent number there to still be processed quickly?
I will even supply you with the necessary tool so that the task is not too hard for you: 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:25:27
You think just because there are SOME transactions that got in for cheap (google "btc tx accelerators"), that means that transactoins were cheap in general? Your "proof" is as anecdotal as my $6 transaction that is still in the mempool as I type this, and no amount of rebroadcasting will change that. The chart I posted is the real whole data available about all the fees being paid - you can keep ignoring it, but I guess you just don't understand how to read it.
Lol and you really keep downvoting me, I guess I hurt your feelings.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:24:24
I have a $6 fee transaction in the mempool since january 2nd (non segwit). You need roughle the same fee WITH segwit to get into the next blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:03:20
Agreed, hard ones are usually a little bit unsettling.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:17:03
Exactly. They want to make money. Obviously they don't want decentralized exchanges that have lower fees than themselves, but in general they want the cryptocurrencies to be adopted by as many people as possible and they want the coins to have a lot of value so that they earn the most money.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:34:35
I am not derailing anything, it is the truth. You can send cheaper now because the mempool is finally starting to shrink again into the  100 sat/byte territory. It wasn't like that for weeks. Check out how the grey area here just kept growing: 
Those are exactly the transactions with fees around $5 and my transaction from January 2nd is still in there. Just because you can send for $5 again NOW doesn't mean that you could have done that a week ago, it was $10-15. 
The reason for that is not that "wallets are dumb" but that people are willing to pay a lot when their transaction is important to them. There is really not enough space in the blockchain for everyone right now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:09:14
Not true, payment in steam was as easy as every transaction: Scan the barcode. They stopped because the blocksize is too small and nobody can use the network anymore because of the high fees.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:38:41
This "whining about fees" is bitcoin's biggest problem - and has been for years. What could be more important?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:11:26


LN was supposed to be here in 2015 (no joke, I can find a tweet from the devs but I am too lazy right now), so I won't hold my breath.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:25:34
A year of what? Having a channel open to TorGuard that you only need once?
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:57:07
haha, I don't even have to read it all to know that your balls are pretty blue. We started this conversation when, 1 or 2 days ago? Everything I sad was true then. You can't come 2 days later and say "now fees are lower, you are wrong!". They were much higher during the last weeks, did you even look at the chart that I linked?
Oh by the way:


There is nothing exponential about the blockchain, that is the whole problem.
This discussion is futile - you could have had a pissing contest like this 2 days ago with me, when what I said was relevant. Today... fees are lower. But just wait, they will get crazy again if nothing else changes.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:15:38


That's good to hear, what is being done except that there is some other dev team working on LN?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:01:16
That's a bullshit argument. The fact that exchanges are centralized does not mean that they want mining or nodes or anything else to be centralized too. One does not follow the other.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:47:03
Unfortunately not.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:38:17
SegWit could have been used on testnet all the time, I don't know what mainnet has to do with the delayed development on testnet.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:11:55
Even with Segwit you are looking at $5 at least.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:21:28
It is technically not really something that makes sense to use right now. You have to open the channel explicitly to TORGuard, even though you might not buy anything from them later - so you still have to close the channel later. That makes two transactions to TORGuard from your side, with twice the fees. LN will be useful as soon as big wallets like Blockchain.info have channels open to big Exchanges like Coinbase. That will be the moment LN will do something for us. Private LN channels will be shitty for years, people don't even have Segwit Wallets yet.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:12:40
Yeah, keep telling yourself that you can send a non-segwit transaction for $5 right now and have it included in a block.... sure. Call it whatever you like.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:08:42
wow, great argument!
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:25:36
Increasing the blocksize is not basic? If that's not basic, what is?
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:50:40
How about the first HongKong agreement?
Or that they/core openly denied a blocksize increase for a years now? It would have been so easy to just implement back in the day - and I am not even talking about Segwit. They just  had to bump it up from 1 to 2 MB and the whole discussion would have gone away.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:09:44
Why dont you bring some arguments and say exactly what is biased?
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:21:56
Where does it say that the lightning network/Segwit is sponsored by AXA Blockstream who want to make money off offchain-transaction? I feel like the moral implications weigh heavy and I am missing this point on the list.

@_date: 2017-08-24 19:02:54


Why would it? If Segwit would lower the fees, the average would be lower now. If the average fee is not lower, Segwit did not help. Maybe segwit will help within a few days/weeks, I don't know, but right now there is no positive measurable effect. It just activated, people are not really using it yet.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:48:50
You do realize that only some people really wanted BCC, right? There is still BTC and that is what we all own and that is what we all care about. Let us make BTC as good as possible and that does include Segwit AND bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:39:32
It's 2017, a block of 4-8 MB every 10 minutes is totally workable.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:42:48
Can we use it right now? That is what this thread is about. Everything else is just talking and no walking.

@_date: 2017-08-21 07:14:24
How was Segwit the compromise between segwit and bigger blocks? Choosing only one side is not a compromise.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:50:54
Sure, sidechains and LN network are nice, when do you think we (the users) can use them realistically?


I thought that was a rhetorical question. Obviously 2x is the first and most needed step. Raising the blocksize has its own problems if you go far enough (size of the chain), I don't think I need to emphasize that. It's nonetheless necessary to increase the # of transactions because blocks are full. 2x will reduce the pressure on the network.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:13:50
Why not? Over 90% miner support says it's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:08:39
I get where you come from and your arguments make sense, but when I learned one thing over the last years it is that you have to take action when you can - if you don't, NOTHING happens. While I would love to take your approach and do it slowly, I am very afraid that when we don't increase the blocksize now when we have the momentum, we will never do it. Core does not want to anyway, so you need to get a new "revolution" going - how long is that going to happen? Another 2 years? I am not willing to wait that long.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:22:12
Segwit2x is the compromise we all need. It's the compromise the silent majority wants. Press on and we will have the best BTC we can in roughly 80 days.

Can you show a graph or anything that quantifies that effect?

Chiming in, I want segwit 2x! It's a good compromise and to combine segwit with slightly bigger blocks is a sure thing in 2017. Make it happen!
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:17:05
Thanks for your reasonable reply. I guess is must not mean BTCs end, but it does indeed look bleak if basically no transactions can be done for a few months. I don't know how much the difficulty CAN adjust if 90% of miners leave. I don't think the difficulty can adjust that loss in hashrate in one step, but I really don't know how that works exactly. I don't really believe core will do an emergency hardfork though, they seem to believe they are the devil's invention from what I read.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:50:06
That's cool and all, but I can't buy anything with BCC right now, and I like to use my BTC a little :)
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:16:19
I am running a full node right now, why would 8 mb be a problem in 2017? And 8 mb is only the maximum, it will be around 2-4 mb when operating normally.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:18:46
What does that even mean? Who are the constituencies?
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:20:09
I don't really see a problem with that. Many many people, including developers, don't. The network is robust and forks are nothing to be afraid of. There tends to be a certain panic about forks in this sub, which is pretty unsubstantiated. If we can make BTC better and compete with ETH and the like, we need to do it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:16:35
There is nothing to test. The mompool is huge, fees are high, and segwit does not bringt any advantage over night because it is a second layer solution. We need bigger blocks no matter what to fit all the transactions. Blocks are ALREADY too small, there is no time to waste.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:21:51
Don't forget 2x, which will also help us keep the transaction numbers high until lightning can arrive. Segwit alone won't be enough and we really need to get these fees lower.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:10:35

@_date: 2017-08-08 13:14:20
I don't get your reasoning. BTC has not received bigger blocks yet. It is still a good idea to increase the blocksize of BTC and many people want that. You just don't read that a lot around here because of heavy moderation.
What are these businesses gaining by "forcing" bigger blocks on BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:41:02
Big blocks will come to bitcoin in 90 days with the 2x part of segwit2x, so I am looking forward to that.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:11:49

Cool, I would like to use this LN system, where can I sign up?
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:22:02
The BCH drama is really good for BTC right now. The fiat that flowed into BCH gets pumped directly into BTC because on the exchanges people can mostly only sell their BCH for BTC. That increases BTC price with every BCH block. That is why we see the price increase in BTC right now. Once people sold all their BCH for BCH, the price will stabilize or maybe drop a little again.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:16:28
Your ad hominem is pathetic.
Which blocks will your nodes propagate if there are not enough miners to get a block every 10 minutes? When all hashpower went to 2x? When it takes hours to mine the next block? You are left with a crippled chain that will die off. Difficulty adjustment only happens every 2016 blocks, so good luck with that. 
Only one real node is needed, miners decide what is going to happen. Look at electrum - only one node is needed there too (if you are familiar with the concept).
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:42:26
Are you sure that it's not YOU that is forking off? If 90% of the network go 2x, it is you who becomes the altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:47:53
The valid chain follows the most hashrate. If all the miners switch to 2x, the chain without 2x becomes vulnerable to 51% attacks easily and gets destroyed. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:36:52

@_date: 2017-08-08 12:44:43
I would call 90%+ a pretty solid consensus. The chain NOT running 2x will fork off.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:06:15
It's not the wallets that cause this, it's the congestion that is the problem. No high fee --&gt; no transaction.
I bought a pizza two weeks ago with BTC and I paid 50 cents fee for a 20€ transaction - my transaction was only confirmed 48 hours later. And it wasn't even that bad two weeks ago.
Can't wait for Segwit to do anything about transaction volume... or 2x - we need to solve this.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:17:34
Agreed. I really don't understand this anti 2x sentiment here. It's 2017 and we have full blocks - we will need bigger blocks to be able to keep Bitcoin growing. Segwit is nice, but not enough right now and the LN network is years away if you look at it realistically.

yeah right... you don't even want to point out why I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:53:06
That might be true to a certain extent, but how many nodes do we really need? Is it really that bad if we don't run nodes in our basements anymore? Most servers today are run in data centers, and nobody complains about centralisation there - why not run nodes in data centers too? The Bitcoin Eco System is big enough so that there are enough big (and competing!) players who want to run nodes anyway, with virtually unlimited up and downstream capacity. I really don't see a problem there.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:38:44
It's technical, it only became political after core didn't do the easy thing and just increased to 2mb after years. 2x is good because it is a unifying compromisie for everyone. Most Core devs will switch after that to 2x, so there is no dev problem. Some fanatics like luke will stay lonely I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:39:04


Right now Segwit is not enough, because the number of transactions barely increased. Blocks are still full, you can see it in the blockchain. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:13:11
That's just stupid. I am benefiting from that because you increase the price of my BTC, but please, don't risk money you can not afford to lose. The price can go up or down anytime, you won't see it coming.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:12:45
Not quite, because what you do on the one chain will make you vulnerable on the other chain - people can "copy" your transaction from one to the other. That means only one chain can really only survive.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:37:17
Why is it a good idea in 2 years and not now? Blocks have been full since 2016 and there is no end in sight. If we increase + Segwit, this problem will be solved for the foreseeable future and we can FINALLY focus on more important things again. If we don't scale 2x in November, we will be stuck in this tiring discussion for another 2 years and BTC will probably lose its strong position. Segwit itself is not enough, and LN is still years away. We need throughput, it's pretty black and white.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:12:36
That might be... which would make him technically an ETH miner, not a BTC miner. Mining BTC directly with a GPU is a waste of electicity.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:55:15
Here comes the "digital gold" argument again....
The thing is - Bitcoin's value is directly bound to its usefulness. The more useful it is, the more people want to have it, which leads to an increase in price. Sure, you can JUST store value in BTC and have NO transaction if you like. But if you could ALSO buy stuff with it, it would increase Bitcoin's value, because it is more reason to have Bitcoin. Why can't we have both?
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:35:21
lol, hard forks don't need permission. If the majority wants something, it becomes BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:48:39
If 90% mine segwit2x, it will de facto become BTC, and the "classic" chain will die off because no new blocks will be mined because only 10% miners are not enough to mine at that high difficulty. The difficulty will not adjust in time and the chain will be dead --&gt; segwit2x = new BTC. If you have BTC now, you will have BTC later.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:38:32

If they just leave the old chain to die, there will be no choice. If 90% switch suddenly within one day, there will only be one valid chain left - the new one. The old one will not produce any more blocks.

Doesn't make his points invalid.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:42:13


Not really, unfortunately:


Instead of the previous (legacy) consensus rule which stated that a block cannot be more than 1,000,000 bytes, the new, tighter, consensus rule is that the total block weight allowed for any block is 4,000,000. Notice that if you fill a block with only non-Segwit transactions, this is equivalent to a block size limit of 1,000,000 bytes (1,000,000 * 4 = 4,000,000).
Thus, we can say the Block Transaction Capacity of non-Segwit transactions is the same as before Segwit. That is, you cannot fill Segwit blocks with non-Segwit transactions and be over 1,000,000 bytes. This is because non-Segwit transaction weight is directly proportional to size. 1000-byte non-Segwit transactions will always have a weight of 4000 no matter what the transaction is composed of.


You can read more here. 
The 4MB blocksize increase for Segwit is only a very small capacity increase.

When the majority changes consensus and wants segwit2x, you have to go with it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:13:49

a) it's only a list of entities that WANT to support Segwit


b) it's old information
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:00:05
You know that the blocksize increase for segwit does not in the slightest increase the number of on chain transactions, right? On chain transactions still are only allowed to be up to 1,00 MB and not more, the rest is reserved for Segwit. That means it is NOT a compromise, because only Segwit was implemented without reducing the number of on chain transactions (we have not enough of those already).

Doesn't look like there is any reduction yet.

You can choose to believe that, but as many people in this thread have already said: UASF only helped a little at best.

That's not an explanation. Tweets are extremely shitty to explain things because they are much too short. Can you tell me yourself what you mean technically?

Care to elaborate your sophisticated reasoning? We saw it with BCC - as soon as they forked, they only had very limited hashpower. Blocks were mined veeery slowly, but fortunately they planned ahead and built in automatic difficulty adjustments. BTC does not have that. Difficulty only adjusts every 2 weeks with a block every 10 minutes. If hashpower suddenly leaves and you only mine one block every hour, difficulty will only adjust within 12 weeks (2 weeks times 6). During these 12 weeks the transactions will be too few to be useful. It's bad today with a block every 10 minutes, imagine that with one block every hour. The chain will just die if the miners go away.

Good job starting a discussion with personal insults. Maybe bring some arguments to the table - why is changing the 1 to a 4 or 8 not possible? Facts please.

I agree and it's really funny.... r/btc hates segwit2x, and r/bitcoin does too... both kicking and screaming that they don't want the "other" side to win. I guess people don't like compromises at all. In my eyes, segwit2x is the best chance for bitcoin.

Thanks, insults were always the best way to talk to each other, I see that now.

Also the users asked for it.... so I guess it is a good compromise. The negativity around here is crazy.
