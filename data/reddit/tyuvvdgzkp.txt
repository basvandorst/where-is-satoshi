there are more coins out there than btc only that are actively used.

of course but bch community is not so small anymore. but I don't know how to compare any coin community.  most metrics can be manipulated.

why do people buy all these other 1300(4633667553664) coins.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:52:46
a tx malle fix does not need segwit, only a part of the code.
but they still need consensus about this change.
I think they will get consensus but that's just my opinion - feel free to ignore it.

there was never a point of return. we will see rising debt until collapse, then (probably) repeat.

if I recall correctly you can buy a fresh blockreward from bitmain for a premium.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:14:26
lol. of course they do that since a long time. law enforcements all over the world support chainanalysis companies and chainanalysis research since at least 2015 (afaik). and chainanalysis only works with a lot of data, so they probably ask/force every exchange to give them these data.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:10:25
yes they don't have time to catch every crime but they need as much data as possible and they could also send this to your police town station in the future if you did commit a small crime.

yes, traceable blockchains are a pain in the ass and I would not touch them today anymore besides speculation on an exchange and never withdraw. so sad, but we cannot say that this was not expected.

why do you think everyone will sell btc who held tether. they most likely held tether because they don't like traditional kyc/aml usd exchanges. so for me this scenario makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:49:08
yes, I mean the fees from the coinbase transaction. and I only talk about a malicious miner here. so the miner likes to mine zero blocks because he like to increase the mempool but is trying to hide it. he mines a few full blocks here and there and from the collected tx fees he creates new tx, so he doesnt help the network. and yes, coinbase transaction cannot spend before 100(?) conformations, but e.g. antpool mines so much empty blocks that a money advance for the fees is no issue IF they like to be malicious (I think this is hard to impossible to proof). 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:55:06
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:29:48
this can be done without being detected: just mine a full block and use the mined fees to create transactions (with the same fee and size) and broadcast these transactions so that other miners will mine them.

I would say that we are far from that. but I would also not bet that we will reach such a low again.

you don't need $131.5 billion to push the market cap of a coin to $131.5 billion.

no. you can spend them immediately.

yes. most of them are sales men and you should be sceptical at least.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:47:43
it's only on-exchange. if you deposit 1 btc today on bitfinex and they lock the withdrawl of your 1 btc until after the fork, they can already give you s1x coin and s2x coin.

I think it's pretty clear that neither xmr, zcash nor mixing-services should be treated as 100% private and all have their downsides (more or less). I don't see where there is delusion, nobody said that xmr is currently always anonymous.

I don't think that governments like usa, eu and china will collapse that simple.
but I'm curious.
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:07:02


it's pretty clear that governments will not allow this to happen.

it's impossible to know all burn addresses (only some are easy to identify) and it's also a lot of trouble to maintain a db with all these and check them. it's also very likely that most btc oldtimer lost some/all coins and these coins are also used to calculate marketcap.

in what dream world do you live? altcoins are here and will be here forever. and I say this although I don't think that most altcoins don't have any added value.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:20:34
if you bought after a +300% spike within one month then you deserve it to lose 75%.
I don't like to sound like an ass here but I think after such a rise anyone with small trading experience would wait.
