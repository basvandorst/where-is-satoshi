@_date: 2019-07-01 21:38:37
I see you're still incapable of proving and providing sources of your claim. But please go on and make it look as if I am the one who is immature.

So if I hold 1BTC in the channel and spend it, that means the channel will close because there won't be any more funds in the channel? Also, would there be any good reason to keep your bitcoins on the chain instead of moving them all on the channel(s)?

If only. I would spend the last cent on it and throw in the kitchen sink as well.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:38:48
But what are the funds used for? Is that the money you pay with or is it simply held in the channel to keep it open but not used for anything else?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:11:47


how much are we talking about?
@_date: 2019-11-01 11:38:19
