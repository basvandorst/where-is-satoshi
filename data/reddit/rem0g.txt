There are no LN supernodes, just nodes. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:19:55
Yes you can see LN nodes and channels at mainnet here: 
Testnet: 
In fact all nodes are connected to each other directly or indirectly using multihop feature. So if a merchant is already connected to municipality for paying taxes and you are connected to the municipality too, your funds will be transferred via multihop to the merchant for paying invoice of the merchant.
Your fund can be hopped endlessly in theory via optimised-chosen route to an endpoint.

My thoughts is they will use colored coins as a sort of replace for USD Dollar or Euro. So you will need an centralized exchange that is willing to trade with those colored coins for fiat.

For deafies it's easy to think how to bring the service to them, it will be sign language + text provided. For blind people the wallet service will be compatible for their needs + hardware. 
I have connections with deafblind people, they use braille too and do have several needs in browsing websites. For example the website must be black, information gathered at one small place or just big letters. It's a very various group.

Deaf people want everything that is sign language based, you probably know there are news at some channels with sign language interpreter. Also they need some accessible information that is done in sign language. 
When it comes to bitcoin, it is still pretty complex. I believe information in sign language will lower the difficulity. It's not only about the wallet but support too.

Very neat, how does it send transaction? Via API or do you need to run Bitcoin Core? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:01:12
A hardfork will reduplicate all bitcoin holdings, so both are at different forks. If you spend coins at the alternative fork (altcoin which will be named ChinaBU/BUT), it wont affect the coins at original fork (BTCs). 
They are not linked to each other anymore, so you can sell the altcoins and buy BTCs (or whatever you want).
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:14:13

Why isn't that explained before in that issue thread of the github repo?
I don't know what the usual practice of developers are, but isn't easier to include the fixes in the first release that may make users more able to have prune enabled in various circumstances? 
The stance of Bitcoin Core is for everyone to be able to run Bitcoin Core, even with limited resources. I don't see that stance back at your argument.

Sorry I'm trying to my best to understand but I don't want to waste your time. Is there any details online I can get my grasp on this subject?

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:13:22
Ok thank you. I wasn't aware of his theories. 
It's actually taken of from the whitepaper here:  which should be at page 49 - 53. Peter Todd seems to have described the scenario from 9.2 about Forced Expiration Spam where the whitepaper mentions about variable(adaptive) block size, but I don't see that happen as the fee will remain high because of 1MB cap. 
I don't see any mention about loss of funds when blocks are full in the whitepaper, but I will keep the scenario of Peter Todd in my mind.
@_date: 2014-10-16 11:24:37
That's a while ago, have you checked the date?

How is the data fetched? An API from  perhaps?

Yes about that we have the same concerns too. But apparently we have different approach on the solution, so what concerns do differs us? Mostly I've heard is only Core is supported by Blockstream, but are there really more concerns aside of that?
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:50:29
Wont relying microtransactions at L2 layer reduce the cost of doing settlements via L1? 
If doing a payment via channel in a every Bitcoin supported-client (Electrum, Multibit, etc) becomes a standard feature, wouldn't it reduce the costs of doing so? 
I believe there are more issues regarding increasing blocksize i.e. more centralisation, weaker spam-protection(?), easier to pollute Blockchain....are those issues not more heavy weighted in comparison with fee increase due to smaller block?
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:53:22
Why would they expect to fix maimed version of Bitcoin Core by the Core developers?
Imagine Sam has build a nice Lego castle, his younger cousin copied the concept and adjusted it to his imagination. While building he probably noticed the structure could be "improved" by adding different pre-chewed blocks and mistreat the whole structure. It was so adjusted it would nearly collapse. Why should Sam help his cousin? He should leave him, taking his precious castle with him and leave his cousin in pain and agony.

All versions from 0.13.1 of bitcoin core on signals segwit, just download the latest version (0.14.0) from 
Requirements: 
- At least 150GB free disk space (unless you turn on pruned mode which will save you alot of disk space)
- At least 4GB memory to avoid lag while browsing and bitcoin core is syncing
- Your pc must be 24/7 online
- Open 8333 in/out at your router

Then the node is non-listing node and only storing blocks. When you open the port, the node will start to relay blocks.
 
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:19:24
You dont need trillion dollars to do that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:51:31
You can start pruning by modifying start.sh to add this parameter: 
-prune=&lt;N&gt; in the bitcoind commandline. &lt;N&gt; stands for MB you want to save blocks at your box, the minimal value is 550MB. 
I don't have generic service/autostart (systemd) script for now, hope someone else does it have for you.

Agreed, which is why Bitcoin first layer is more and more becoming a settlement layer therefore it's overkill for simple payments, as those should go via second layer which is specifically designed for that (thousands txs per second instead of 3 txs per second).

There, yet Segwit is working well at testnet while BTU fails already with a few lines of code. In sum I'd trust Core developers whose have experience to code and review well while BTU developers already put Bitcoin in dangerous situation TWICE with only a pair of lines code.

To stop Bitcoin Core:
    cd $TARGET_DIR/bin &amp;&amp; ./stop.sh
To start Bitcoin Core again:
    cd $TARGET_DIR/bin &amp;&amp; ./start.sh
To use bitcoin-cli program:
    cd $TARGET_DIR/bin &amp;&amp; ./bitcoin-cli -conf=$TARGET_DIR/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf getinfo

To uninstall Bitcoin Core:

No, you reversed it. The ChinaBU nodes/miners will reject segwit blocks while segwit nodes/miners will reject non-segwit blocks larger than 1MB causing transactions will not confirm or much later to confirm.

Not even BU...they are actually running Core with modified coinbase since we know those miners did not crash. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:09:48
This might be the best reference for you if you are running linux - 
If you are willing to run Bitcoin Core at your pc (probably a windows machine), just download bitcoin core from bitcoin.org and open port 8333 at your router.

Bitcoin Unlimited pushed by mostly Chinese miners and Bitmain (Chinese company making mining machines), which is why it's called ChinaBU.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:59:20
So like 127 to 124 if you take off the last zero. 
So much for making such a post.

It's more complex so you really have to dive deeper in the details of Lightning Network. 
In short, it's not a part of Bitcoin Core but BUT it's a part of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Try to see it as light knotting ropes (LN) to the heavy titanium chain (BC) purely for transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:46:23
Your transaction contains alot of outputs (about 25), that's why you paid alot for that. It includes 7428 Bytes of transactions which translates to 0.0135BTC fee (7428 Bytes * 181.807 sat/B = 1350462 Satoshi -&gt; 0.01350462 BTC)
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:16:27
Ok, do you mind to calculate what the usage at board level would be?
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:07:45
If they are fast enough (in case everyone want to sell ChinaBU/BU tokens so its value will drop so hard) and there are exchanges willing to add the altcoin, then yes they can profit from that.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:50:47
Nope. If you sell ChinaBU tokens, you will gain from that and buy BTCs. So that's a double win for us.

Looks like your Bitcoin-Qt doesn't accept incoming connections. Head over to your Bitcoin Qt client and go to Preferences via Bitcoin Core, and then go to Network. Is "Allow incoming connections" enabled there? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:08:45
It's a fact you can't ignore. As an equation; It would be weird too see if GPUminers are still mining near-dead altcoins at loss even when there are profitable ones.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:06:26
You have to look to total earnings per mining/hour/cost/energy, which is per bitcoin higher compared to bcash. It's the only different factor.

Mining hardware has not changed much pretty lately, those hardware operare at equal cost as you are mining BTC or BCH. It doesn't matter. Indeed you get more BCH but far less income generated in USD or BTC, and while cost of mining stay equal you are making loss mining BCH. 
It's really not that hard to calculate miners are losing money with Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:06:23
I haven't said mining BCH is cheaper, it's only a question I've stated there.

Not only Bitfinex but BTC-E, Xapo and Tether.io are having problems with USD withdrawals too. BTC-E is switching to a different bank and will re-enable USD withdrawals by the end of the month again. 
It seems there is growing tension from the banksters against Bitcoin. I'm curious how this will play out for Coinbase since they work with only one bank.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:14:12
Well, your evidence isn't about microtransaction too and describing bitcoin in general with L2 included even he hasn't described that since then. But later he provided examples of payment channels and L2 on top of Bitcoin Blockchain to provide a better suitable way for microtransactions. That's why I understand from my general knowledge due to high fees termed in BTC it even can be used for microtransactions but is never meant for. 
In contrary to using L2/payment channel you will pay maybe 1-10 satoshis for a transaction so it's more feasible instead of between 18,000 - 92,000 satoshi per transaction. So again no evidence from developers but you may need to know bitcoin is a lot further developed since satoshi has left the project in hands of Gavin Andresen and among others. So I don't rely too much on the visions of Satoshi anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:29:08


Bitcoin is never meant for such type or transaction, it's designed as a settlement layer which provides immutable ledger (which is a heavy duty chain) for lighter chain layers (L2 and maybe L3 and more, like Lightning Network) which makes for users more convenient to pay microtransactions for coffee and so on. 
See L1 (Actual bitcoin BC) as a expensive paper, you write in small font as possible at it and put sidenotes at post-it formats (L2) by the side of paper as much as possible. The small notes / postit's refer to eachother. You will end up with massive cheap postits instead of wasting rare expensive A4's.

It absolutely does! I try to promote it's remittance benefits in digital nomad groups too and I can tell it works pretty well. 
....so far I've yet to see a black bitcoiner. I've traded Bitcoin four times, 3 in CT and 1 in Stellenbosch. It's rare to see a black bitcoiner, since it's mostly used by expats/vanderlusters/digital nomads in SA. Those groups are for 90% white in my experience.

He is testing market reaction. So far by "denying" segwit market immediately drops. By "opposing" BU/EC there is no any market reaction. 
I suspect by market reaction he will go for segwit in eye of profit gains.

Well Spondoolies and KnC went bust because they couldn't get to the needed profit-margin, still Bitmain was growing. Bitmain used ASICboost, those companies did not.

Insert LN provided by payment processor here.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:31:50
The list I provided you is a example of the participants in the bitcoin economy, you can trust by their activities their support to UASF or any proposal to upgrade Bitcoin protocol. Miners have to follow the voice users, not opposite. 


That was the first step when we did not foresee what could happen in the future (which is now), UASF is one of the last decision that's been brought upon us. Now we vote and sound our support against malicious miners. You've been probably not for a long time active in Bitcoin talkings, but there's a lot happened between those steps.
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:08:58
If I understand correctly, by enabling L2 solution it's more easy to start as a bitcoin bank by issuing own cryptocurrency pegged to bitcoin blockchain (sidechain or colored coins) and using atomic-swap via LN with other cryptocurrencies of different bitcoin banks.
So LN provides layer to enable fractional reserve banking with self-issued currencies which would create more possibilities to be a own bitcoin bank while Bitcoin Blockchain provides PoW base by validating the records.
That's pretty much the future we are heading to.

Can you point out for me where is it stated purely only the node count is a measure for reason of a softfork?
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:15:50
Economic majority by industry and users support. Node count isn't only one measure for activating UASF at August 1th.  BIP148 will be revoked when there is not enough support (Shaolinfry stated that). So in short BIP148 will be revoked when maintainers of USAF concludes there is no supermajority support which can be mesured by a lot of variables together:
* Miners
* Nodes filtered by IP and network
* Industry companies whose rely on the Blockchain (Exchanges, 3rd party services, block explorers, Casino's, darkmarkets, ransomware services)
* Developers
* Users
* Amount of UASF-caps in Twitter feed
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:05:52
I'm allin for segwit for sure, but that weighed measure should, how good their intention is, not be used in any parameter for taking decisions in case of softfork/hardfork. 
Coin.dance is showing measure by capital of company, and I don't feel all right about that. Because web traffic is hereby measured, so Coinbase is a lot bigger, alternatively their weight should be same as for example Kraken/BFX/et al. Even better, measure by importance in service for bitcoin (40% for exchanges, 20% for miners, 10% for brokers, etc) and split those percentages of a category of the related businesses. Just brainstorming, but still it's a wrong step to provide such a weighted measure.
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:16:52


It already is and will become more expensive in the future. 


That's not up to Core, they are only developing and improving the bitcoin protocol. 


No everyone can run LN node, there is no such king in the LN node network.

This article does not really give in-depth view about the rise of Bitcoin in SA. But I can give some details about Bitcoin in Capetown and am happy to hear any followups from Jo-brug, Durban, etc. 
Due to volatility in Rand, recently announced downgrade to junk status and political instability investing in any other currencies like USD/EUR and also Bitcoin are growing. It's easy to buy those currencies. But thanks to SARB (South African Reserve Bank) policy the costs and ways to do so are higher/more difficult, for example: as a South African you can open paypal account but any income is restricted to your SA bank account which means you cant spend income of your paypal account to any other paypal accounts. Meaning you have to find more expensive alternatives and rely at much smaller 3rd party services.
So Bitcoin provides a really interesting to workaround the restriction, so far SARB sees the market as peanuts so they haven't yet prohibited it but issued a warning some time ago due to MMM-ponzi scheme. Now interest in Bitcoin is growing, there is still some skeptical voices around here. 
Still i've managed to sell some Bitcoin for Rand and took +10% profit because of safe-margin to avoid loss in time of volatility (Of BTC/ZAR both..!) but mostly because Bitcoin is more expensive in SA comparing to Coinbase rate. At this moment of writing 1 Bitcoin costs 16,778 ZAR (=1250 USD) while at Coinbase it costs 1942 USD, so +6% difference. So I use Bitcoin purely for remittance to avoid transfer costs (4,50 EUR fee for ATM and 3-5% for paying with creditcard because of Rand volatility) and most important: make some friends in CT. 
Overall it's really interesting to buy Bitcoin in Europe/USA and sell it for Rand via Mycelium. I recommend, while you are in CT and you want to do so, contact Gold 'n Stones ( But there is one downside, while carrying alot of Rand in cash it can be exhausting to protect it since crime in CT is relatively high and continue to grow.
BTC/ZAR price: 
Rand/USD atm: 
Any questions are welcome and I'm in CT till April 30th.

Arent you describing security by obscurity? By providing binary-only releases you are hiding security holes on purpose and we have to rely our trust on BU developers for the commits which also sets a DANGEROUS precedent and crushes the trustless-based ideology on purpose too.
Please don't forget if the accounts of BU developers were hacked and they push the new binaries which will 1) fork off immediately or 2) steal all your coins? 3) or do the both?
@_date: 2017-04-02 06:12:55
If you are going to use bitcoin for cup of coffee, you are better off with using LN while bitcoin blockchain is for settling stuff. 
In fact a cup of coffee is a form of microtransaction, $2 is for me a small amount really and it becomes also clear the transaction fee is taking a part of the $2 transaction. I am fine with that fee, but using the blockchain for transacting the coffee+payment it's overkill. I don't need to see that transaction saved by over thousand years in the blockchain since I know it can be processed by LN which is more convenient in processing microtransactions and also brings a lot of benefits like no more waiting for confirmation time, faster processing time, double spend might be impossible(i think), and so on.

Best method more and more people are using might be: 1) Look for a reliable ICO close to deadline 2) trade Bitcoin for ICO tokens, 3) when ICO finishes, sell tokens at exchange for bitcoin
ICO mostly does not require KYC/AML and you need an exchange that does not require KYC/AML as long you do small transfers.
(Yeah, I know ICOs are scam but apparently they are being misused as money launders which is why they are gaining million dollars of capital)

You calculated it wrong. 
Blocktime of Bitcoin = 10 minutes * 100 = 1000 minutes, coz BCH hashrate is less than 1% of Bitcoin Hashrate; so 100/1 = 100.
1000 minutes equals 16.5 hours. BCH throughput will be 8 MB about a DAY if it's less than 1% of Bitcoin hashpower.
