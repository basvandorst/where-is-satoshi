Oooor, less liquidity everywhere as one more exchange fights for a slice of trader pie.
I imagine *some* (being generous) liquidity may have decided to stay away from bitcoin until (another) regulated exchange came online, but it will likely be marginal until some other real development catches peoples attention.

There are plenty of laws regarding cyber-bullying, to various extents in various jurisdictions. Nobody here has ever upset or offended anyone online have they?

Legacy banks are the reason for those 5 days. In the future we won't need to allow them to hold us hostage for 5 days when we want to move money around.

Exactly like how a flat tax doesn't mean everyone pays 10$. It means everyone pays the same rate.
(Which sounds like what btcc is doing)

If that were that case the republicans would have been for it.

Looks like there have been more buys than sells over the last week or two.
That might change. Or the trend may continue. If you figure it out let us know so we can all be rich next week.

You think bitcoiners are better behaved/less selfish than the rest of humanity? Thank you. You're wrong, there are assholes regardless of where you look. But thanks anyway =)

It should still be at 1 dollar, or 160 because nothing fundamentally changed. Or 400, or 1000. Your overall attempt at direction is the right one (don't make emotional financial decisions) but the reason why is stupid.
The only thing that needs to change regarding whether you buy or not is if you think adoption will increase.

It is almost like someone that knows how to make money thinks that they will become profitable. You should call up the people that gave them that 3.5 million and let them know that they have no idea how to invest in startups. Maybe give them a few stock tips..... =)
