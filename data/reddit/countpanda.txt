There are a hell of a lot of government jobs require a lot more work and paying a lot less than a "policy analyst."

"I'm leaning more towards thinking I'm the center of everything and all that matters rather than declaring the world a utter heap of random worthlessness."
Does not compute.

I'm not having a philosophical argument with you. I'm saying your response to that quote from Michael Chrichton made no contextual sense. That's all.

I don't understand YOUR argument. You said you didnt like his argument because he says its necessary. Well that IS his argument. I don't know of any realistic alternatives to taxation.

He was a "policy analyst." He may be quite right about his own case, but how he thinks being a policy analyst is comparable to most government jobs is beyond me.

Did you create and sustain the internet, roads, and countless other institutions that allow you to engage in commerce safely and freely? Taxes aren't theft, dude, there the most basic tenet of the social contract. No one really wants to live in Galt's Gulch.

Extortion implies a lack of reciprocity. Taxes are not extortion--they are sometimes (not always) a mandatory cost of doing business though. Taxes are the fabric of the social contract. I know you say you're for them because the alternative sucks, but I wouldn't cede the semantic argument by letting taxes be called extortion, robbery, or theft. They're just not.

So are you saying that taxes are an objective, immoral evil that we shouldn't have or are you just having fun with definitions?

Cherokee Nation and other Native American reservations are counted as countries in some situations.
