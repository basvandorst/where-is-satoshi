Apparently it is only one of his hedge funds, namely MVP 1, which has 50% of its value in btc. [
The overall wealth his firm manages is $2.2 billion.
Here's another article [ which states that in october the fund had "$154 million in assets under management" and the share of BTC was 30% with a BTC-Price of $6100 at that time.
If the numbers are correct he therefore has around 7,500 BTC in his fund.

The circlejerk is real. Invest in bitcoin become smart.

And this guy at 14:26 still hasn't understood it. He is adding the 4 million BTC which are allegedly lost to the 16 million in existence and concludes that you can only buy 1 million more.
All they see it the $10,000

What did he steal and which people did he con?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:15:08
So there are 2 five star reviews with one of them liking the bcash feature and you conclude that he wrote them himself?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:43
And what do you have to gain in doing such petty attacks?
It just shows that this sub is not better than r/btc.

This guy is so annoying, wondering who is watching him and actually follows his investing advice.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:54:48
he also advised to buy bear stearns....

Bitcoin Itcoin. When can I expect the airdrop?^^

In your script you assume that exactly every 4 years there is a reward halving while in reality the reward halving doesn't depend on the years that passed but the blocks that were mined. 
The reward is halved every 210000 blocks. He divided 210000 / 4 = 52500 to make the calculation fit into your script, which takes the years to calculate the supply.
I hope I could clear it up for you.

Well, china nowadays is as capitalist as it gets.
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:44:10
Every state restricts its market to some extent, even the United States, that doesn't mean that it is not capitalist.
As long as your interest is alligned with that of the communist party you are free to do what you want.

The price was below $3000 a month ago...
You missed the buying opportunity.

As far as I understood it right he said yesterday that it may be compatible with BIP148.

It may be that they collateralize your ETH with the same or a greater amount of ETH. If the smart contract is closed you get your earnings.
But they would need a lot of ETH to do it this way.

Obviously in this scenario the dollar hyperinflated and its worth is only 1% what it once was. The bitcoin price compared to today's dollar value is $50,000.

If you are a US citizen you can't trade there for now. They are still working on the permissions. But the trading platform looks really nice and is trustworthy.

You will have 1 BTC on each blockchain. So if Bitmain hardforks you can spend 1 BTC on their chain and 1 BTC on the non-hardfork-chain.
In case of a hardfork you can read up how you do this, likely on the ledger website. Just don't try to spend the coin by yourself until the dust has settled.

It is a plot to uncover satoshi. He will have to inevitably reveal his bitcoins from the first blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:18
You could open a lemonade stand accepting bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:53:33
so much for the price rise^^
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:00:05
Since you have your private key you will have both coins.
They said that they will help users to spend their coins on the fork they want to.

I had some wallets with a few thousand satoshis left on them. I guess everybody has had them.
This could sum up to a good number of coins.
