Inflation robs the purchasing power of your savings, even if your wages are rising too.

“Limits in the amount” seems questionable.

Can you give more details of your script?  What programming language is it in, and which exchange do you run it on?

Thanks!  Do you fund coinbase from a bank account on a recurring basis and then have your code execute after the funding is received?

Lol. If you didn’t write that on a apple product you wrote it on the product of some other ‘evil company’.

Yes. I use computers, and know many others do too. I also am fan of open source and Bitcoin.  From my experience, most people are not using “open source” computers.

This only includes technologies that neared 100% adoption.  It is survivorship bias.

I do not disagree with your point. All of our money is debt and it is all created out of thin air.  Congress has delegated its authority to coin currency to the federal reserve - it is an extension of congress. 
However, the government does spend money and does take money in. Money is taken in through taxes, but when that is not enough the government issues bonds. The federal reserve buys many of those bonds, creating even more money out of thin air and debasing the currency. What is not taken by the government in taxes is taken by the government through inflation of the money supply.

The federal government is spending much more money than it is taking in, and as a result the government must borrow money.  The government sells bonds to borrow money. The extra bonds put on the market cause the price of those bonds to go down, and the interest rates to go up. That is where the federal reserve comes in. They create money out of thin air and buy those bonds - monetizing the debt and keeping the interest rates artificially lower. 
The federal reserve is the monetary authority and the federal government is the fiscal authority. The federal reserve is funding the government.
