Wow, interesting you posted here. I work for Kevin Guest House, which was the first hospital hospitality house in the country and which RMH is based off of. I'm also a huge BTC fan and was thinking about talking to our ED about it as a possibility for payments.
1. What downsides would you say there are to a place like us accepting BTC?
2. I would assume that BTC would be far more useful for large donations and event sales than for guest payments. What have you primarily used it for?
3. Any chance you'd be able to contact me outside of Reddit so you might be able to voice your opinion on it which could help convince out ED and board to try it out?

Obviously the government is not perfect. But I don't understand why you think a bill meant to protect Bitcoin is bad.

Can you tell me where your notebooks are manufactured?

Any chance you'd choose to manufacture in the US in the future? I choose not to buy anything made in China, sorry.

Awesome, I hadn't even thought about tipping and microdonations. I'll be sure to mention that.
I'm wondering about tax and accounting related stuff. If you hold on to BTC, how do you report that to the IRS with regard to volatility? It seems to change every day.

Oh yes, because the government never did anything good or protected anyone. It's just evil.
