I haven’t stopped in her for 4-6 months.  What a clown show.

Yes I had a transfer stuck for 10hours. That was real fun.

Yeah classic to you and the bitcoin community but Jesus... don’t show the world that Pictor and say “hey this is us” people we will be most skeptical then
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:59:10

When you use bitcoin and can’t get a confirmation within 10minutes

Thats some seriously embarrassing shit if it goes through. What are you guys 7yr olds?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:27:35
Yeah like how subreditts turn into shit holes so communities have to go make a new page. Then the clowns end up showing up there and all the serious discussion has to move again. 
I don’t mind some humor, something clever, genuinely funny, but come on, the moon, hodl, lambo. How can you keep saying the same shit 1000x over again and still think it’s amusing. 
It’s like watching retards laugh at their own farts on a loop video

I’m still here? ����‍♂️ you do know how Reditt works? I get dinged with your replies when you reply to me. Kinda sorta like an instant message you know that right. 
Lol, what a stupid fuck

This place is a shit hole now days. Everyone taking pictures of their shoes and toy cars with Tesla drawings. 
What happened? Even if we hit $10,000 have some class 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:19:56
But..but..but.. all we need is SegWit and oh man to the moon in my Tesla..... LMFAO!!!

Sounds like BTC still has some serious scaling issues they haven’t figured out. Kinda sad for 100 billion+ valuation 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:46:15
I just sold 80% of my BTC for ETH. 
BTC community is a tough place to want to hang. 
Plus seems like they will just keep announcing forks to pump the price and then cancel them if they want. Doesn’t seem decentralized anymore, and scaling is not ironed out yet. Getting weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:24:53
Lol, Bitcoin has such a bad scaling problem that it’s taboo to even say which side you prefer?? Lmao

Upvote that shit all day
