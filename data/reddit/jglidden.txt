Criminals also use $20 bills I hear.  Hopefully they protect me from those next.

He says bitcoin use and price are 94% correlated doesn’t he?

Is that second snippet a sentence?  You’re missing a period.

He went after me saying his point went over my head but it didn’t, I simply disagreed that bitcoin is a bad investment vs Berkshire.  
And what is your point about the 10y for bitcoin vs the 10y of Berkshire?

Just because you didn’t invest in bitcoin a while ago doesn’t mean we didn’t or that you couldn’t have.

2 people arguing now (including you) that nobody has invested in bitcoin until 2018.  Me and the other person before you joined the convo that not everyone learned about bitcoin in 2018.  Plenty did well in bitcoin through the years and you know that’s true.  So I’m not sure why you’re trying to argue that he’s right.  That’s not dissimilar to saying nobody made money in tesla or any other stock until recently just because you didn’t notice it early it it recently flattened out, as bitcoin has done dozens of times in the last few years.  Zoom out beyond the last few months.
Also you know what?  I don’t care if you guys continue to stay out of investing in crypto.  More returns for the rest of us.  I was through this same argument with my friends in 2013 when it dropped to 1k and they assumed that meant it was a failure.

Or alternatively, you’re so narcissistic that you don’t understand the counter point everyone else is trying to make, and assume you’re the one nobody understands.

He can be pro Bitcoin and pro Ethereum.  They're used for different things.
