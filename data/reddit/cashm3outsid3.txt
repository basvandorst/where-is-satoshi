yeah - I'm trying to get into this and my first transfer seems to have taken forever and a half to go through and I have no confirmation that it did. 
i don't get the hype and all the 'fight the power' mentality around it.

Arent they pegged to a crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:35:26
The answer is no lol

you're asking why i'm here - i assumed because i'm not echoing your beliefs about bitcoin. why did you ask then?
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:15:51


you really think this?
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:56:36
When I'm reading about the tech it seems that other crypto is trying to improve the tech to make it faster and more secure for instance - that makes me think a better version will come along, know what I mean?

my understanding is that bitcoin isn't as anonymous as many would like to believe, and if my credit card information is stolen i'll call mastercard and be reimbursed. if my bitcoin wallet is hacked game over.


bitcoin doesn't have a long term history


how much is your bank charging you for this?

huh I just googled SEC and "Bitcoin is the future of finance" and couldn't find it.
I'm just skeptical that it'll be specifically bitcoin and not another, better version of the technology that comes out later. 
AFAIK transactions are slow and expensive using bitcoin so I don't see any reason to prefer it to fiat currency.
And don't three rich guys in China do like 75% of mining?

I said it's the most expensive way to transact that I'm aware of. I was comparing. Day to day transactions should have zero or near zero transaction costs

In this place I see my views will be unpopular but fwiw I don't see my self a bitcoin hater - I think the idea is really interesting. Fiat is just a piece of paper and Bitcoin is just a number on a screen. Neither is beyond questioning, and questions about what makes them valuable are interesting and hard to answer.
The whole 'you can't make more bitcoin' thing is untrue - you can make your own version basically for free. And a currency with a fixed amount is not useful in the long run - let's say a population or economy grow - I think they'll need more currency. If crypto is the future and fiat will die this problem will need to be solved.
Maybe transactions have improved as I haven't performed any cryptocurrency transactions after Q1 of this year. Adding a faster layer on top is interesting but unless it's faster, more reliable and stable than current banking solutions again, why use it?.
I guess for me the question for bitcoin or any crypto is: what can I do with it that I can't do faster, cheaper, and safer with USD?
The whole decentralized thing is interesting but I don't see the value in it to be honest.
The government can't confiscate my cryptocurrency? So if I am committing crimes it helps me? If the only large scale applications are money laundering and selling illegal goods/ services it's not for the average person.
And inflation exists yes, I agree it can be thought of as a tax on cash holdings. But bitcoin does not have a long enough history to consider it any kind of reliable store of value - I see this repeated a lot online - almost like a religious mantra. If you really want a store of value and nothing else - bitcoin would not be any reasonable person's first recommendation.
Also - if you invested that 1$ in the S&amp;P in 1913 you'd have $22 grand today (from google). This is what most people would recommend.

I have bad news for you.
Or let me ask you this? If crypto that is identical to bitcoin is valueless - what is the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:29:16
how high are you right now?
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:52:38
I have, and it was expensive.
Actually - the most expensive way to transact that I'm aware of.

this is your comment...
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:18:26
why did you ask then?
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:51:52


because i find the idea interesting - sounds like you're looking for an echo chamber of people who all have the same opinion.
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:44:35
isn't bitcoin basically free to replicate? opensource and all?
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:32:56
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:39:22
currently, fiat transactions cost me $0 and are instant. why switch?
