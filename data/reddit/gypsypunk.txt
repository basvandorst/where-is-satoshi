Hey man, considering you were right on your prediction anything you say will be gospel to me from now on. I would like to subscribe to your twitter, newsletter, email distribution list and pornhub stream.

You're like Buffet with way more sex appeal.

You’re an idiot.

Yes, that's why I own 1.0921839124 bitcoin. I don't visit this subreddit just to call people dumb (though it's an added benefit for sure.)

If that’s true that your independently wealthy off btc then grats
