Hm interesting, couldn't you buy coins low ($104) at BTC-e transfer to bitfloor and sell at the higher price? Assuming the difference stays relatively consistant for the transfer time.

Just a bunch of shitty out of context quotes. The trillion dollar coin idea was an ingenious way to side step republican obstructionism and brinksmanship over the debt ceiling.. but you wouldn't know that from this obnoxious graphic here.

A horse walks into a bar. "Hey why the long face?" the bartender asks, to which the horse replied, "I just found out I have AIDS".
Have a nice day.

Maybe you could answer something for me since you have experience with this,
When Bitfloor says:
"For the purposes of deposit only we have created a bitcoin address for funding your account. To fund your account with Bitcoins, send the coins to the address below. Funds will be available after 6 confirmations. "
Now it says each confirmation takes 10min - so does that "Funds will be available after 6 confirmations. " line update after each confirmation goes through?
So after 10 min it would say - "Funds will be available after 5 confirmations. "?

Sorry if this has an obvious answer, but is there a way to auto sell your bitcoins if it falls below a certain price?

Wait.. It costs $10 to print a $100 bill? Soo how much does a $1 bill cost?

Luckily my account is verified and the transfer went through (well left mtgox - has yet to arrive at bitfloor), are you saying everyone with unverified accounts are locked into mt gox until trading resumes?

If you want this information to be more accessible to the regular everyday person I would avoid this kind of language


It reinforces the idea that BTC is for the hacker/activist community and not something the average person should get involved in.

It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. This was from 6 years ago and Bitcoin wasn't even invented yet.
