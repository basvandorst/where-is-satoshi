Shots fired, nice one!

While they don't seem very enthousiastic, what did you expect? Wild cheering every 2 minutes, or girls gone wild?

Nothing to worry about this is just uneducated hate. I also have a very strong dislike for java, but if you keep up to date there is nothing to worry about.

Have a look at kraken.com

Sorry Theymos, you need to go. You currently have too much power over the two main communication platforms for bitcoin. You're the cause of all this mess and it won't go away by enforcing even stricter rules on this subreddit. You're obsession with trying to convince yourself Bitcoin XT is an altcoin and shouldn't be discussed here is absolute insanity. Allow for a new moderation team, it's the only way this subreddit will calm down...

Absolutely agree, we need neutral mods!

POI is a really interesting concept, I wonder if it isn't just plain better then Bitcoin's POW...

Wow this setup looks so ghetto :-D. Also I sincerely hope the reason you bought USB ASIC's is the coolness factor and not the hope in making any BTC back, EVER.

Hmm, How does this work?
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:32:43
Wow, I had to log-in to tell you I love it! A couple of remaks:  
* Music is nice but maybe feels a bit too aggressive for a commercial?  
* Music just slightly too loud  
* Fonts used were a bit too over the place, keep it all the same  
* Don't link a bunch if urls in the end, just one with some information and links to other websites  
But I truly love your video!

Most likely worthless, ask yourself:
Why sell hashing power if it's so profitable to do it yourself?

So wait, I need a coinbase account for reddit bitcoin tips? Or is only the bittip chrome extension using it?
