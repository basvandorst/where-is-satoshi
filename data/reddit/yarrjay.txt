Agreed it was necessary for the evolution of the currency for Gox to shut down.

I'll be sure to tell my mom, dad and grandparents they shouldn't use Yahoo anymore.

Possible that we'll never know the true answer to this question.  Could have been poor accounting + transaction malleability bug or it could have been something more colluded.  All we know was MtGox was a clusterfuck at it's best.
More interested to hear the fate of those responsible for the losses.

Honestly - i think the interview was very poor. You didn't provide a use-case for bitcoins in laymans terms.
When he asked "Why?" you went off into a tangent about the 80's and the internet and decentralized domain registration (which i still have no idea what that was about).  You failed to provide a meaningful use case for the currency that anyone can understand.  
At the end of the interview the host summed it up pretty well.  "It seems to clear up the mud, a little bit..."
Users need simpler explanations of what bitcoins are, their benefits, and parallels between digital currency and FIAT so they understand the concept isn't as radical as it may seem on the surface.
