You're an admirable human being and I say that from the bottom of my heart. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:43:09
You must be a weird specimen then...

They spend it on their friends businesses and to pay for luxury vacation for them and the people they like .... they use it to pay huge salaries to stupid fucking people doing nothing in an office all day. We dont need that. An ideal society would have a government with their books wide open. Every transaction every penny spent could be examined by anyone at any point. We're still living under a complete and total monarchy its just  that only a small percetage of the population sees it.

Tell me what you think happens when BTC hits 1 Trillion marketcap... push it even further. Tell me what YOU think will happen if BTC hits 10T marketcap ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:38
By growing in maketcap man. You dont have the vision ? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:42:44
It rises like this without any major correction because it is  undeniably the future of money. BitCoin is trustable and very real. Prepare yourself for BitCoin being traded @ 100K within 5 years.

Wow you must have anger issues or something for insulting a person like that over the internet. Must not be very happy. Have a good one man.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:01:59
They will charge a percentage... problem with BitCoin is when youre buying a 50$ shirt you'll pay 10$ in fees ?! Oh just 20% ok that seems fair.
12$ trio at mcdonalds, 10$ fee sure no problem
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:44:52
Banks charge as low as 9.99$/month for unlimited transactions. MasterCard and Visa charge 0$ NADA for transactions. Please explain in precise details how BitCoin (BTC) could be used as a form of payment like Visa or MasterCard when the actual fee for a transaction varies from 5$ to 20$ US. I'm VERY CURIOUS.

I like your optimism. Might actually happen 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:42:14

@_date: 2017-11-14 20:25:34

@_date: 2017-11-14 20:26:32
And dont even think about fucking hot women thats completely out of your league for sure. If it wasnt you wouldnt insult and be mean for no reason like you are. No true alpha male does that you fucking nerd
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:54:43
No worries youre a nerd and will always be a nerd. Maybe get your dick sucked once in a while it wont do you any harm and you will be a nicer human after :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:38:54
Come on man you know exactly what this guy is saying. Hes saying the mineable number of BitCoin is decreasing (one day will run out and become legendary and make you feel like a fucking retard if you didnt buy it). Are you that person who always make a scene because someone doesnt use the exact right words... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:50:57
Dont blame it on me if youve been a pussy all your life
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:12:16
I don't agree.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:34:22
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:43:37
Oh you think banks break their back to charge you interest ? You fool 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:28:14
I am not a US citizen. When this happens in Canada big boy ... oh wait ... it won't.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:33:29
Very good reply. You are one nice fella to give such detailed and good info for newbies.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:44:11
It is time to stand tall and strong against this fucking madness. Let's show these guys they're done controlling our every move and life. I'm ready to die for this cause as nothing is more important than freedom. The freedom to choose where I keep my money and how I spend it. They will bend the knee to king BitCoin or they will suffer the consequences !

J.P is that you ? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:33:00
BitCoin is different. Its a technology here to stay and about 80% of the sypply is already in circulation meaning that they already lost the fight. They will have to deal with it one way or another. If they dont and ban it then every country will have to make it illegal which is highly unlikely because imagine a poor country they see it as an opportunity ti attract the wealthy and get money in. They would never make it illegal. If the US is the only developed country ti make it illegal then theyre fucking themselves in the ass. They are fucked both ways man ...

I fear being scammed by Bitcoin's LN who will be governed by HUGE corporations and banks. BCH is satoshi's vision. Memo.cash is amazing. Bigger blocks do the job of keeping the fees low... Bitcoin "core" has become a shitcoin. 2nd layer solutions when all they had to do was raise the block size to what ??? 2MB ? 3MB max to handle all the volume. Bitcoin has become the ultimate scam coin when we saw 30$+tx fees.

I don't even know where to begin... clearly you lack knowledge for making a statement like this so I guess nothing I can say will make you understand how dumb what you just said was. Ill give it a shot anyway. You should make a little research on why cannabis was made illegal in the first place... what were its uses before it was made illegal. It was the most cultivated plant in the world (still is)  and used for a million purposes in America including dietary supplements, textile, medication (YES MEDICATION). Do your own research it will open up your mind and eyes. Cheers ! 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:18:09
What ? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:35:46
Can someome explain why we would need such a LN when we already have other coins like for example Nano or BCH that are already really cheap (or 100% free in Nano's case)  on tx fees and blazing fast in tx speed. Im just curious.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:04:31
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:30:09
Bro LN still has fees ... take for example NANO... explain to me in details how LN and BTC are a better alternative than NANO (Instant tx and ZERO fees). Im just curious
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:06:17
Good answer. What do you think about bch my dude ? No bad question. What do you think about the idea of having bigger blocks on the btc chain... or reducing block time by 50% for example. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:28:26
It's 4/20 my dudes
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:45:44
Likely is a scam ? lol
