1) lines moving up and down
2)+ became - and - became +
3)people passing off opinion as fact
You know, same shit as any other day in here.

Well, that explains the lateral price moves for the past few months.

Those dips are going to look a hell of a lot less impressive in 2018.

Any updates?

**Dad:** There’s ads all over my Facebook for Bitcoin and all of my friends are asking if everyone else is getting into Bitcoin.

In the interest of full disclosure, I rarely read any of the posts I comment on.

I’m quite pleased with the BTC value recovery of my altcoins over the past few days.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:32:37
No more Bitcoin2x so people are likely to slowly buy back into their altcoin positions over the coming months. Let’s face it, $1000 swings in either direction aren’t really any cause for alarm anymore.

I feel that you’re wrong about Facebook. My father is a retired police officer of 28 years, frugal af with his money and hodl’d through the market collapse as he watched a large portion of his portfolio dwindle. We’ve got hodl money coming in now.

How many trades &amp; withdrawals have you executed on the exchange?
Execute a trade for $100 at 11%(generous margin compared to that of the time of my post with "incorrect math") $111 less 3% trade commission $107.67. Withdraw fiat from the sale using any of their methods at an 8% commission $99.06. Assuming indacoin miraculously grows in trade volume, how will competition driving down the price make this profitable for me? I'd love to see your math.
@_date: 2016-09-06 14:37:23
Tumble that $100 ;)
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:41:00
It's a p2p exchange w/ escrow but you're paying a slight upcharge, depending on payment method, to get your bitcoins fast.
Might not be available in your area, again slight upcharge for same day.
Small transactions but once you're all setup, it's immediate.

Been around for years and has a 3 btc 24hr volume?
@_date: 2016-09-09 05:42:22
Execute a $100 trade @ 11% $111 less 3% commission, $107.67. Withdraw fiat using any of their methods at an 8% commission $99.06. They had their chance but they fucked themselves because they were greedy. GG Indacoin

Ok, so with this exchange negative pennies add up to profits? Maybe you can elaborate how that works. The (-) indicated negative profits.

You could hire a hitman on the DN, I heard it worked for this guy named Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2016-09-08 14:32:12
After their withdrawal &amp; trade commissions, you walk away with -.3% lol
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:47:34
Do you only post these updates when you decide to not fuck over buyers? Within the past week you jacked up your fees again and the price was over $1000 for a single coin.
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:20:32
  The price on the exchange was roughly $712 when it cost a buyer $950+ for a single coin. All they've done is reduce their fees. As a seller, the exchange is still shit. They take an 8% commission on all withdrawals. After the trade commission, you're clearing -.3% at the REAL current market price. To combat the 8% commission, you'd have to invest your coin with them for 250+ days to accrue 8% interest. Early withdrawal from your investment is subject to a 5% fee + a loss of all accrued interest. Much better spreads with exponentially less bullshit 
@_date: 2016-09-06 04:16:30
The buying and selling of people's financial information is a fowl act but I've seen the listings by DN vendors and unfortunately there's plenty with all the aforementioned information. The point is, when you price a single coin at nearly $1000 USD you're either catering to the ignorant or the immoral.

Check out the exchange volume here:

I doubt it. They're based out of New York and that state doesn't fuck around when it comes to regulation. If you actually withdrew that amount then you were 100% flagged. What does the branch manager of your bank have to say about it?

You're likely flagged for money laundering and the Feds are investigating everything. No support staff is touching your ticket with a 50ft pole.

Gemini has already been contacted if this is the case. Make a test purchase to see if you can still use the exchange. Either way, grab a lawyer so they can start making inquiries to the appropriate channels.

No need to worry, it's just bussiness.

Indacoin.com/inner is where users/investors sell their own coin. Current price on the exchange is $744 yet the cunts running the exchange are charging buyers $984. Assuming it's actual users/investors selling coin, Indacunt is making an additional $240 on every coin sold + the ridiculous commissions they're taking on each investors trade &amp; withdrawal.

They want you to go walk up to a teller at the bank and deposit cash into their account, not a transfer you'd initiate over the internet.
If you want to wire money, why wouldn't you just use an exchange?
Edit: Wire Transfers are not safer. I can cancel a wire transfer for $35.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:53:14
I would just clarify what piece of paper they want you taking a photo of. I always have my buyers write on the deposit receipt "[username] non-refundable BTC purchase"
It's a common misconception that a buyer is able to walk back up to a teller and claim they deposited money into the wrong account and get a refund. Unfortunately, some tellers are incompetent and do it anyways.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:46:45
If the wire transfer appears in their account as pending they'll likely release escrow. The buyer then cancels the wire transfer and walks away with their cash and coin. There's been plenty of scammers that have ruined different payment methods for the honest folk.
The whole purpose of LB is to sell coin at an upcharge because of the convenience. Most sellers don't bother with payment methods used by exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:42:31
LB acts as escrow so you're perfectly safe depositing cash into their account. So long as you follow all of the requirements in the advertisement and clarify anything that's still unclear in chat, you'll get your coin.
I offer multiple payment methods but teller cash deposits seem to be preferred by most buyers.
If anybody is at risk using that payment method, it's the seller.
