No, here's the hypocrisy: "stop selling your bitcoins, I want you to use it as a medium of exchange, not a speculative instrument!"
(news flash: being bought and sold is how something gets used as a medium of exchange)
Even the neckbeardiest bitcoin neckbeard says things like "people see an opportunity to make money on bitcoins," not realizing that they just implied bitcoins aren't real money.

There's no such thing as "converting" to a different currency, with bitcoins or any other currency. Trading is all you can do. When you go to a bank to convert dollars to euros, you're just trading your dollars for their euros. The bank will later trade someone else in the opposite direction at a slightly different rate, making a profit. They are a business.
Similar businesses exist for bitcoins that will gladly trade them for dollars or vice-versa at a rate which they specify. They do this to make a profit, just like a bank.

I read the OP as saying he had $30k in bitcoins when they were worth $25 each, not $14. He bought his first bitcoin at $14. Which would leave him with 1200 coins for a total value of $155k.

In fact, he never said he had $30k of bitcoins at any point, only that he had $30k of balance transfer available.
