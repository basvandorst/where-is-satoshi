Either one gets the point across.

Not in 2009.

Not necessarily. You should send your cash somewhere you trust, not just the place that has the lowest exchange rate. If I were in your position, I would trust Coinbase with this purchase if you're in the US.

Don't worry about it. Everybody's gotta start somewhere, no question is a stupid question. To answer yours though:

What is this from?

I'm not sure if I didn't do the math at all or just wrongly assumed you meant now instead of 2009, but I was wrong. I stand corrected.

If the end user (regardless of how new they are) throws money and personal information into an "exchange" or service like Coinbase without fully getting a grasp of what that service actually offers.. that's stupid and foolish. If you don't care enough to read the fine print and understand what's happening on a website that's going to handle your money, you shouldn't be using it.

If that's what's going to happen, then yes it would be wise to wait. Unfortunately, you can't ever tell for certain what's going to happen. This whole thing with Chinese BTC buyers could lead to another temporary dip in the price, or it could keep skyrocketing until it plateaus or dips again. You never know for sure.
Personally, I think it's a good idea to put some money in now. If you don't want to go all in that's wise and understandable, but if you have a disposable amount of money you don't mind staying in limbo for a while (until you choose to sell), then it's a good idea. I don't have any doubts it's going to rise again, and continue to do so. At the very least, I doubt it's going to settle and plateau for less than it is now.

I'm not the most educated person in regards to bitcoin and PayPal's relationship at all, but to me this sounds completely plausible. I think if there was a way that PayPal could monetize from their account holders selling bitcoins or mining hardware (and if there was not direct competition to PayPal, or the degree of fraud that we've seen with people buying bitcoins with PayPal), then they would have no problem with it. Even if bitcoin posed some sort of competition.. so do credit cards, debit cards, and almost any other sort of electronic way of sending currency. The amount of bitcoin-related fraud and shady refunds have a huge amount to do with PayPal's stance on bitcoin, not specifically the currency itself. At least that's my view.

You can buy as little as $0.10 worth of BTC on coinbase - it's not a significant investment but it is something to play around with. Try it!

Yeah, ok. Maybe that's the way it should be, but that's not how it is. You live here, you know the laws, don't be surprised or offended when they're enforced

Thank god for prepaid college funds. $5500 for 4 years at just about any school in the state? Yes please, I'm definitely buying this for my kids if it's still around when I have them.

If you sell btc on or near the end of the week it can take a while (3-4 business days).
