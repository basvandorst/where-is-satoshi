Paypal has also been added to Coinbase as a payment option. 
Our system controls the payment flow to grow gradually so your account does not get flagged, paypal does close accounts if they start receiving a few thousand a week instantly but keep it to $1-2000 growing gradually has no issues. 
We have been using paypal to buy and sell paypal since 2015, had chargebacks and sent them blockchain proof of payment and won 2 reversals. So they know what Im doing and have not closed my account. I must mention that this was when we were selling it on ebay. We no longer do that they have to many unauthorized accounts buying things and they keep the fee's even when you return the paymrnt.
We have also used paypal buttons hosted on paypal to buy and sell bitcoins with no issues. 
They are worried about money laundering and criminal activity. if you are not doing anything questionable they will leave you alone.
We also use a business not a personal account.
If you do a google search you see Ebay has had this up since 2013  As you will see We commented on it. 
See here that Ebay clearly allows the sale of BitCoin
Now tell me how paypal is against bitcoin, how do users purchase it from ebay? Paypal. 
They do keep their TOS written so they can close you down for anything they want, if you follow our model and keep it professional you will be allowed to do business.

Providing a safe easy way to sell bitcoin at a profit is helping the community is it not? This was developed to help people, If i explain how the developers built the entire system, the information would be useless unless you have your own team of developers and why would you do it if you werent trying to make some kind of profit in the end.
Anyone can obviously sell bitcoin above the market price themselves, but not with an automated system, id verification, transaction system, paypal fee's included, plus 15% above market price, that pays you without doing anything other than depositing your bitcoin to sell.

Watch as I double my bitcoin amount within 2 minutes, I do this, every day, no gimmicks just an easy strategy to follow, working as of july 2017, I have made alot of bitcoin using just this strategy.
This is simple, so like the video! because no one else, has shown you how to do this! and it actually works! no fake scripts or rediculous hacks.
All you do is, bet until you get 4 or more losses, then double or quadruple the next bet, thats it, works 99.9 percent of the time.
in this example I used 1000 for the base bet if you have less, then use 100. Do not touch any other setting and never use auto bet, or your on your own!
If you do lose its because you were greedy! dont double up the bet too high if you dont have much to start with. if you dont hit within 2 tries stop and start over again. 
If you have any questions, leave them in the comment area and i will actually answer them!
Please come back and tell others how this worked, for you!
GOOD LUCK!
