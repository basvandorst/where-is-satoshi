Bitcoin is an inefficient system, you have to explain what it brings to the table to make up for that.

Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that it is uninflatable, immutable and cannot be confiscated. This makes it ideal for final settlement and large, important (and international) transactions, and in theory a long term store of value if it gains wide adoption.

It’s always amusing when progressives are enamored with Bitcoin, because if it ever became ubiquitous, it would destroy the means of implementing their worldview.
The ability to print money and forcibly redistribute wealth is the foundation of the social welfare state. Without that, it crumbles. Bitcoin denies states that power. 
Krugman seems to be the only progressive that understands this.
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:31:01

Most of the money we use today is already digital. 
What's unique about Bitcoin is that instead of these digital transactions being processed/approve by a central authority like a bank or government or credit card company, Bitcoin transactions are approved by a decentralized distributed network of hundreds of thousands of computers all around the world.
There is no middle man, you don't need anyone's permission to perform a transaction. 
You can transmit any amount, to anyone, anywhere, instantly, at little/no cost, and no one can stop you.

Agree with the OP, need to create alternatives address existing weaknesses/limitations of current electronic payments system, like:
*requires permission from payment processor
*requires revealing personal information to payment processor
*transactions can be blocked
*micropayments are impractical
For most of us in the developed world, the first three are not much of a hindrance. Sure we have to give credit card info or link up a bank account, but the vast majority of us never have our transactions blocked or information stolen. And the transactions are instant. 
Until/unless the currency collapses or a severe police state is imposed, an uninflatable, permissionless money system is not something people readily see a need for. 
In the near term, BTC apps should focus on micropayments, because that is a useful function our current system is unable to provide.

I don't think academics realize the consequences of Bitcoin.

It's useful for our side for Andreas to perpetuate the "corporations are evil" mantra, because otherwise there is no way progressives would support bitcoin.
Bitcoin is far more threatening to welfare states that rely on forcible printing/borrowing/taxing for their entire political system than it is to corporations. 
Andreas' Bane-like mantra against corporations is unseemly, but it serves a purpose (just as his demagoguing of fracking does). 
It's a dog whistle for progressives that gets them to accept bitcoin when they otherwise wouldn't.
Instead of "if you hate wealth redistribution, you will love bitcoin", it's "if you hate corporations, you will love bitcoin".

Think about what it would take for Andreas to concede Bitcoin is a bad thing, given how much he has invested into advocating for it. It's inconceivable.

[LINK]( to SEC press release


An SEC investigation found that Erik T. Voorhees published prospectuses on the Internet and actively solicited investors to buy shares in SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds.  But he failed to register the offerings with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws.  Investors paid for their shares using Bitcoin, a virtual currency that can be used to purchase real-world goods and services and exchanged for fiat currencies on certain online exchanges.  The profits ultimately earned by Voorhees through the unregistered offerings totaled more than $15,000.

Andreas likes to focus on large powerful institutions that will be disrupted (banks/military) by bitcoin, but there is another side of that he is leaving out.
Namely, the tens of millions of people dependent on forcible wealth distribution in the form of government benefits. These are not powerful or rich people, but they are numerous.
We saw in Greece what happens when you try to take benefits away, you get violent riots. 
Sure, bitcoin prevents governments from spending money on endless war, but it also prevents them from spending money on health care, infrastructure, education, and entitlements.
Personally I see this as a good thing, but let's not downplay the consequences that will occur when millions are cut off from government benefits and are forced to beg for bitcoin.

It amuses me how progressives are endorsing bitcoin because they want to be hip with whatever cool new technology people are talking about. Like it's the new iPhone or something.
Their worldview is largely dependent on the ability of governments to print money and take on massive debt. It's a means of redistribution without taxation. 
They also desire tight control over financial instruments and interest rates.
If Bitcoin were to become ubiquitous, that all becomes very difficult to do.

Too often decentralization is preached as an end in and of itself. What is the value of decentralization?
Decentralization in payment processing means
* transactions cannot be blocked
* transactions cannot be reversed
For the average person (in the developed world at least), this isn't very exciting. How often are the electronic payments you  make (as sender or receiver) blocked/reversed? That has never happened to me personally.
Decentralization in issuance (which I hadn't really thought about until reading this article) means
* eliminating risk of devaluation/inflation
* eliminating risk of counterfeit
All wonderful things that I personally think will be transformative. But it's much harder to convince the average person of that.

this would be like advocating for multiple internet protocols instead of TCP/IP
or advocating for more languages like Esperanto
it inhibits human interaction and exchange of value and information
But it doesn't really matter what you think is best served, long term the world will gravitate to a single monetary standard (like it did with gold). Thiers' Law holds, good money drives out bad, choosing something else isn't really an option.
In the short term it's just scamming people out of their wealth they could/should be using to store in bitcoin.
