That's good too, thanks!

Something I would like to see in a crypto app is charting of social media presence, i.e. separate charts for people on the coin's subreddit, discord, telegram, slack, Twitter, Google trends. I feel like so much of a coin's value depends on the growth of it's following, it would be great to have an app or website that showed it. If one exists, I'd love to know about it.

I think his comments have nothing to do with developing their own coin, otherwise they would have announced that by now. He doubts the utility of Bitcoin in its current AND future state, which makes me think it has more to do with the exponentially increasing computing power and energy supply demands of Bitcoin and other PoW networks, which is a fundamental problem that can't be solved by 2nd layer tech like LN. He doesn't come out and say it because he would likely singlehandedly crash the crypto market, but he certainly hints at it.

It also would explain the reports of how hastily the futures are being introduced. Gotta do it before the market cap gets too big to be easily manipulated.

This is a textbook pump and dump by the banks. All of the money that went in over the last few days/weeks is going to come right back out once they're allowed to short it with futures. Doesn't it seem odd how hastily futures are being introduced? So the market cap is still small enough to manipulate. Or how it was just announced that Goldman Sachs will be responsible for clearing futures contracts? You think they aren't going to exploit the shit out of this? Look at gold futures in the 70s. Before the price skyrocketed, the price dropped 20% in the first year of futures being sold, even while the USD inflation rate was around 5%. Now think about the volatility of Bitcoin and how easily the price can be manipulated and do the math.

You really can't right now. The Bitcoin network only averages 7 transactions per second, compared to tens of thousands per second by VISA/MasterCard. It's a known bottleneck, which has led to higher fees and transaction backlogs as more people adopt. Solutions are in the works (LN, segwit, forks), so this is probably the most important aspect of Bitcoin to pay attention to in terms of its use for daily transactions. For now, it's just digital gold, i.e. a store of value.

Interesting, I didn't know the difficulty can decrease. Thanks!

How does a lower hash rate make it cheaper to mine? Hash rate is just the collective computing power but, as far as I know, the block difficulty rate will always continue to increase.

The price of land back then had more to do with the massive supply of unowned/undeveloped land and lower demand/population.

Except that USD buying power has increased

Can someone explain to me what future Bitcoin has when the network's requirements for computing power and energy consumption are exponentially increasing? Seems unsustainable to me.

The point is, on a macro level, the price of land will pretty much always outpace inflation because of limited supply and increasing demand/population. Land is a bad example to begin with because you were talking about production and you can't produce land.
