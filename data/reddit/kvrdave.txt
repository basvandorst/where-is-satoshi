Does that mean you just got the tap on the head?  Get ready to swallow the rest of Trump.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:16:14
Because he was claiming to be an independent person outside of the election, but it turned out that he was working with the Russians and contacting Trump's campaign about the release of emails, etc.  In fact, he was the one that convinced the campaign to release some of Trump's tax returns so that they would look more credible in the lie that they were unbiased.
At least that is why I don't like Assange.  He's a Putin puppet just like Trump, and neither is good for the average US citizen.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:27:53
Okay, it should at least be evidence that he wasn't unbaised as claimed and was a foreigner helping trump in a coordinated effort to sway an election.  That may not bother you, but that's why Assange is looked down upon much more today than he was two years ago.  That may not be satisfying to you, so feel free to keep believing it's all just part of a plan to MAGA or whatever you prefer.
Essentially, he's gone from being someone who appeared to release any information no matter who is was against to being Breitbart.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:15:37


It seems to me as well.  But if Debbie Wasserman Shultz tells me her organization (the DNC) is neutral and it turns out to be a lie, then fuck her.  If Julian Assange tells me that Wikileaks doesn't take sides and it turns out they obviously do, then fuck him.  It isn't about the side he took, but that he claimed to be something that was shown to be absolutely false.

Then put a bag of flaming poo outside her door, but don't fuck with the elections of a foreign country.  I use to be a big fan of his, and I sure as fuck didn't vote for Hillary, but that doesn't seem like too much to ask for.
He could have done what he was doing and simply been honest about it.  He could have released things without going having secret discussions with Trump Jr. about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:43:43
This is what people who can't think say.  I didn't vote for Hillary.  I wouldn't vote for Hillary.  But you need to find a way to keep explaining Trump's cock in your mouth so you assume it must be this.

As a gamble, I think it is a better gamble than it would have looked like 2 years ago, but it also doesn't pay off like it would have 2 years ago.  Part of the whole "risk/reward" thing.  There is still plenty of reward, but not as much.  But I don't think the risk is nearly where it was, either....but there is still plenty of risk as well.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:40:49
If you look at charts for the year, the weekend dollar shortage is typically not significant.  It is similar to people believing that people leave the stock market on Fridays.  Those that follow that rule, soon find out they lose money doing it.  We humans try to find patterns in things, and the weekend dollar shortage is one such example.  Next look at the amount of exchanged this weekend on BTC.  Not significantly bigger than the past few weekends.  A bit, maybe because of recent news, holidays, etc., but not huge.  
I'm not saying that people aren't flowing to LTC as a result of BTC, but I don't see it as a stabilizing force, or a long term force.  I think that if there is a bubble over the entire thing, LTC is more likely to experience one sooner, and much bigger.

If you can't handle losing $10k, then don't risk that much.  I have a pretty significant amount of money, and the amount I have "invested" in bitcoins is $1,000.  This is truly speculation, no matter what all the die hard, and trolls say.

I own a number of rentals, and this is a bad idea.  You are essentially speculating with someone else's money.  Forget the legal issues (and there are some), there is no point to it.  Would you put a deposit into Microsoft stock?  That is effectively what he is doing, but with the hope that BTC increases.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:18:54
That sucks.  Personally, I don't trust many merchants that take BTC yet.  I tend to wait for places I knew before BTC to start accepting them, kind of like reddit.  It would/will be nice when Amazon starts to accept them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:36:49
Then once you/they do get them, you will find the other big issues are people will little computer "know how" losing them and not knowing how/why, etc.  Like I said, this is a big thing, but there is a lot to be improved that is part of the "holding bitcoin back."
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:49:30
I don't think they'd get into the exchange business either, mainly because of regulations based on their current business.  But they could make way for another company to be made, or purchased, that simply has the same giant parent in Ebay.

Perhaps we should consider buying low and selling high.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:40:13
A better analogy than mine.  I was also into baseball cards and thought the same of the Magic cards.  And it was a crazy bubble.  Certainly there are differences between those and BTC, but what happened to make the spike could be effectively the same.  Everyone got into sports cards because of the "investment" without necessarily believing in the inherent value of them.  If most of the buying now is speculation from those wanting the investment, but don't see inherent value, the same thing can easily happen.  Though it would likely just be a correction in price.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:24:12
I could easily do this as well, but if the idea is to be among the super wealthy, you will be disappointed.  It won't bring you happiness, and your problems will simply be different, and typically bigger.  But it is tempting, isn't it? LOL
Since I try not to be about greed, I am happy to be at a very reasonable amount of BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:35:03

I think they are valid points, but I also think that mining is happening faster than newcomers are getting in.  I saw this coming a bit ago ($107-$110)  and just sold out.  Didn't believe it could hold above $100 with what was going on.  Don't believe it can likely get much below $50 either, though.
Ebb, flow.  Ebb, flow.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:11:25
And I find irony in an "atheist_soldier" having to deal with the fact that BTC value is based on faith.  LOL.  My guess is that it will be rationalized away and the belief that there is some inherent value will be clung to, even if it can't be rationally verbalized.

Yeah, I just bought more, and that is something I wasn't going to do.  But I might buy stuff.  The worst part about BTC is that I spend them easily because it doesn't feel like "money" but more like I got a gift card.  Unfortunately, it is like a gift card I paid for myself.
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:53:31
There are people that believe there is a sell off on Fridays for the stock market as well.  If they follow your same line of reasoning, they will lose money over time.  Bitcoin is still new, still getting its legs under it, and if people bank long term on a trend, it will eat them up.

@_date: 2013-03-29 15:47:47
I still think of it that way.  When people (usually here) talk about IRL money being "declining currency" I generally think that the slight decline in that money (relative, over time) often looks a lot better to me than the wild swings of BTC.  But, BTC is still an infant.  At this point, I see them as poker chip investments.  And some day I may "cash out."  But I don't have enough to really worry about.  It's just a fun speculative play.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:42:05

@_date: 2013-03-28 13:08:57
Until you convert it back to a more stable currency, I would not think of it in terms of having made a lot.  I have a lot of faith in BTC, but it is still in the "early 90s baseball card" phase.

@_date: 2013-03-29 21:46:05
And that is sound thinking.  I may just be too conservative. LOL  I think I am probably just "happy enough" with how I expect BTC to perform without mixing in what I see as "early adopter start ups" into the mix.  I think the majority of BTC owners have it for safety vs. fiat at this point.  And if they aren't spending much, that isn't good for BTC only merchants.
Just make sure you do very thorough due diligence on any company you think about investing in.  Personally, I'm waiting for a mutual fund to start up that invests in all things BTC related.  That I would buy because some fund manager has more time to dig into company numbers than I do. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:59:02
I think that would stay "hidden" about as well as an escort saying that you are just paying them for their time. ;)

It does no such thing.  Cryptocurrency does NOT directly monetize a mathematical abstraction.  It does nothing but create something that might be given value by others.  It is people like you and I that directly monetize the mathematical abstraction because we actually value the BTC.

Haven't really followed this and don't know much about Silk Road.  But, from the various readings here I saw that Atlantis folded shop a few weeks ago without much reason.

I mentioned elsewhere that the biggest hurdle may be that BTC are used by (generally) more tech savvy people currently.  And tech savvy people have no problem getting porn for free right now.  Your pool of clientele (being those who pay for porn and use BTC) might be too shallow at this stage of the game.
There is little I would want to do as a merchant that was only BTC.  Too many holding on to them as speculation and not enough spending them.  Yes, there are plenty around here that spend them, but not when looking at a "I need to make a living off this idea" type of thing.

Stabilize will be a relative term.  In 5 years I would expect the wild fluctuations to be mostly over, but BTC will continue to increase at least with real inflation based on other currencies. Especially when you consider that there will be a finite amount of BTC and dollars will just continue to be printed.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:29:17
Not a big deal.  Treated no different than dollars in this regard.  And when the news broke BTC went from $49 to $60.  This adds a bit more legitimacy to BTC.  Might be bad for nefarious use, but it is good for BTC long term

He is actually not an idiot, but is the reason bitcoin is going to have a tough time with true universal acceptance.  If it can happen to early adopters (and I'll say that he is), it will most certainly happen to my grandmother, my mother, my blonde sister, and my moron kids.  So why will they buy that second round of bitcoins?  This is a problem waiting for a good solution before bitcoins truly takes off.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:44:23
When a commodity is still relatively scarce, like bitcoin is, it doesn't take much to make huge moves.  Add geeks into the equation, and a lot of people take profits as they get nervous.

@_date: 2013-04-11 11:11:51
Though I agree with OP and this is highly speculative, given how wildly this trades, and give how relatively few "days" were lost in going down in price (8?) I still have a problem thinking of this as a traditional bubble.  It was simply a bad day.  Generally a loss of 50% in value would of course be a bubble, but when you have many consecutive days of 10-20% gains, this should still just be considered a correction.  
But yeah, my guess is that most around here in BTC are just young enough that they haven't lived enough to see these things before.
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:39:22

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:02:24
I was like you.  Here is what convinced me (and I have very little money in this).  This has an absolute known quantity of BTC that will ever be available, unlike USD, or any other fiat currency.  Your comment about the Russian Ruble is good, but remember when that happened the big thing that killed confidence was there wasn't even an accurate number of how many their were.  There was no accounting, but just making more because they needed more.  Confidence flew away.
Given that this is a fixed number, and given that it is secure, private, individualize, and no central authority, it only has the value "we" assign to it.  That value grows based off a couple of things like whether or not places will take them for goods and services (growing now), the number of people who get in, and the value we see in being able to put our fiat currency into this "thing."
So confidence in all fiat can go bad.  Cyprus is an example, and Spain, Greece, and others will become examples.  Fiat can be taken from you with very little you can do about it.  BTC cannot.  In that respect it is very secure, and similar to actual gold (though that increases through mining to some unknown number).  BTC has value in a place to store wealth, and that value is whatever we all end up deciding, and what we are willing to pay for more.  If I were in Spain, I would value BTC over my fiat (though at what level, I'm not sure).
Some see it as nothing backing it (which there isn't), but fail to see that their fiat is the same other than the fact that the government has to take it for taxes, and other legal services, goods, etc.  But it is only worth what our faith in it says it is....just like the Ruble.  And if confidence in the USD goes away (like the Ruble or the Euro, potentially), it is still only worth what I can purchase with it.
I simply think that long term, there is better value in the full faith backing of human beings similar to me than in bankers, governments, and IOU's written on the backs of our children.

@_date: 2013-04-15 02:40:19
Incorrect.  People will not buy bitcoins if it means they have a good chance of the currency they used to buy bitcoins has a high probably of being worth half of the currency they used.  Bitcoins is a good way to buy things, but not at twice the price of fiat.  That's stupid.

@_date: 2013-04-03 20:31:17
What, there is an "if" in that?  You are talking about societal value in mathematical concepts, which is different from value in a currency (crypto or fiat).  Calculus cannot purchase goods from Amazon, even though it has value (which is only in the knowledge and future use of it).  The value in BTC comes only from the faith and belief of like-minded people (long term) that will keep it propped up and valuable.  By itself, it has no fundamental value, just like kvrdave bux.
I've said many times that I am a believer, but not a koolaid believer.  I understand it for what it is.  And for too many people, it is Jesus....their religion, their salvation for the world, etc.  It amuses me.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:47:04
In theory, so long as fiat currency continues to be printed and is inflationary, bitcoin will continue to go up. But you also have a lot of speculators right now, so expect a bumpy ride.

I can see regulation in trading, etc., but outlawing is really silly...to the point that it is pointless.  You might as well outlaw the purchasing of any other currency.  If a government were serious about this, they could (all on their own) truly manipulate the market.  So far, they don't seem to care enough to do it.

There are some good issues.  I have personally thought that if some "bigger better" system comes out, in order to actually get it to gain acceptance, they would need some type of system to actually buy out existing bitcoins, but how that might work would be up for grabs.  Without that, the next currency has no trust either, as no one wants to buy it if there is going to just be another "bigger better" system that makes it worthless as well.

Yeah, no analogy is perfect.  I just think that there are a lot of speculators that have read articles and have bought in for the same reason that people are drawn to pyramid schemes.  I think BTC is legit and long term,  but I also think a lot of people flock to the "get rich quick" idea.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:32:21
Nice to know. It would need to be that way if I'm the one paying the fees instead of the merchant (yes, I know that it is really always me that is truly paying the fee).  Personally, I prefer using Amazon and having them just take it out of my checking account.
And really my biggest "complaint" about a place like bitpay or bitspend isn't what they charge, but that it is another step/process/site to go through just to buy something.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:52:04

The price is going up because more are trying to buy them than sell them.  That can create a bubble.  If it does, I don't think it will be huge.  Huge being relative to other sudden decreases. LOL

Most places that use BTC actually have something that it tied to the current exchange rate.  So the price may fluctuate in BTC on the page if you refresh it in 10 minutes, or it may change when you add it to your cart.  A merchant, likewise, can use a service to automatically change that BTC purchase into USD (or whatever) at the point of sale.  
But you also have to remember, even the original dudes still call this an experiment.  This is still the infancy stage.  I think BTC does end up stabilizing enough that those services aren't necessary, but I think that is a minimum of a year away, and that is highly optimistic.  As much as people can be cheerleaders around here, BTC is far better to protect wealth right now than it is to use in commerce.  But those things will catch up.  The pain in the ass of buying BTC will get better, and the products available to securely hold your BTC will also improve.  There is A LOT of room for improvement, but again, this is an infancy stage.
My faith comes from knowing that this type of product has an absolute need.  People need (and can now with BTC) protect their wealth from seizure by the government.  You always could by simply trading your fiat for another fiat that seemed more secure.  Putting my USD into Yen is perfectly legal, and was great for about a decade, but you are ultimately just in another currency that can crash based on government, etc.  So it ultimately comes down to who you trust more.  I don't really trust people a lot, and think that people in groups are even dumber, but I find I will still trust it over a government deciding that it needs 20% of my bank assets because of their poor planning.

If that amount won't change your lifestyle if you lose it all, there is no reason to worry.  This is still baby steps.  If it becomes a truly legitimate thing, today's price will look like pennies.  If 5% of the world population decides to start using it and keeps 5% of their money in it, this will look like pennies.
But if something goes bad, you could lose it all.  I would take your coffee fund, porn fund, beer fund, etc. and put that into BTC.  If you lose it all, you haven't lost much.  But don't go crazy.  And I have a lot of faith in this long term.  But I also got pissed when VHS beat out betamax.  Sometimes the thing that should be the obvious winner still loses.

Quite amazing.  If a player like paypal got in, it would take Bitcoin from being so much of a gamble.  I believe in it, but still most people haven't heard of it.  But with paypal, bitcoin has instant credibility, fast name recognition, and much easier adoption.  If I were paypal, I'd buy up a bunch of bitcoins prior to announcing they were getting in.  That's an easy price double.

Paypal, whether you like them or not, would easily be the biggest player to actually give BTC the time of day.  There is no way that could be bad for BTC overall.  Whether or not you ever use the service.  They could also actually provide an exchange that would be far more reliable than Mt Gox.  And they are big enough to offer some security (likely insured) for online wallets they hold.  I don't like Paypal, but this would be a game changer.  And while I don't like a lot of their rules and the way they work, I'd trust getting my money from them (given time) more than I would with most of the small fry BTC places currently.
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:07:46
The biggest weakness in BTC, in my opinion.  There are several stories around here about people losing them for good.  When/if adoption really takes off, a lot of people that don't know much will lose even more.  It will take a lot of confidence away. People around here don't like to hear this, but for the success of BTC, it must be usable by the lowest common denominator using them.
But if I were you, I'd convert some to physical bitcoins and put them with your will, etc. and include some instructions for your wife in case you die.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:45:25
You are speaking about the past tense, and that is correct.  Today the most powerful unions/guilds are those for government workers who bargain with people who are paying them with other peoples' money, so it doesn't matter to them if they bankrupt Stockton, CA.  It doesn't matter to them what the rest of the world/workers get so long as they get theirs.  And to ensure this, they charge a lot in union dues, which goes to electing more people who will give away public money to the unions, which will continue to flow to them.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:36:54
That's part of my worry, though.  A small company taking BTC still needs to buy merchandise with USD or some other currency.  And if BTC drops 15%, they will lose money, and enough that they may not survive.  Or the owners may start to "gamble" and keep the BTC in BTC, which is nice, but again, a wildly fluctuating thing like BTC currently is can put a business out of business very quick.  And that is when you see the posts of "I ordered XXXXX and they went out of business.....now what?"
I need bigger companies in it for me to spend much on products.  Currently, it is fantastic for p2p and services.

Okay, you guys obviously know more about it than me.  No way a company can ever succumb to a hostile takeover either.  Because when they do that the last few would only sell for billions.
Fuck, if only I had said "or at least enough."  BTC is still in the kiddie pool.  If seriously big players wanted it gone for no reason, they could do it.  Don't believe it couldn't happen.  We need it to be under the radar long enough that it grows enough that it doesn't matter.  That isn't yet.
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:44:42
the USD may be inflationary, but it is far more stable than BTC.  Putting all my eggs into BTC would be as foolish a thing as I could imagine.  I expect it will continue to climb, but many thought the same of Worldcom.
I believe there is a future for BTC, but it is not certain by any means.  And given it is has a value based solely on what others will pay for it (it is not backed by anything either), it is like an IPO at this point.  I would never put all my eggs in one basket.

I just made a cryptocurrency called kvrdave bux.  Are you saying that simply because I created them, they have some fundamental value?  The only value BTC has is what others place, and continue to place on them.  If they decide not to give value for them, provide service for them, etc. (for any reason), then BTC has no value.  A USD has the backing of the US government, and while we may both agree that it doesn't mean a lot, a BTC has the backing of nothing but our "belief" and "faith" in others seeing value in them.

The odds are stacked against the player in all casinos, IRL or on the internet.  2% edge to the house is pretty decent.
Personally, I'd stick with just "investing" in more bitcoins rather than looking at related companies.  The companies are far more likely to fail than BTC, and if the companies really do well, it likely means wider use/acceptance of BTC, which will increase the value of them.

Absolutely.  I'm only saying that I believe BTC will outperform places that take them.  With BTC you are "betting" on adoption to continue upward, which will increase the price, and you are betting on more and more merchants accepting them.  BUT, in investing in places that simply take them, you are betting on their management team, their financial skill, their business model/plan, etc.  And personally, with gambling sites, which have a troubled history on the internet, you also have to worry about things like governments saying that it is actually gambling with real money and cutting access to entire countries.  That damn near killed Party Poker, and all the other guys.

I actually hope this is true.  I've tried to compare BTC to regular stocks and it isn't quite the same.  I wish it would be, because I could do exactly what the chart says to do.  Get ready to sell, and buy back in.  I hope this happens.  Please let this happen.  But it is regular humans, and it is global.  And so far it hasn't acted like I expect.  But please let this happen.

Something certainly should have been done about this.  It isn't like the final amount of bitcoins will be in the billions.  It will be 21 million.  While that sounds like a lot, if you had actual widespread adoption, the inevitable accidental loss will eventually be a problem.

Wild value swings are like this.  And a lot of people that had an original amount of $1,000 and saw it go to $25,000 and now it is back to $8,000 think they have "lost" money.
If you really like bitcoin, have a reserve of it, and buy more when you spend some.  Pretty simple.  Even though I just broke that rule and bought more because of the dip.  I've still bought more merchandise value than I could lose if BTC went to zero.

Satoshi Nakamoto was the pseudonymous person or group of people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the bitcoin network in 2009. Beyond bitcoin, no other links to this identity have been found. His involvement in the original bitcoin protocol does not appear to extend past mid-2010.[11] Nakamoto was active in making modifications to the bitcoin network and posting technical information on the BitcoinTalk Forum until his contact with bitcoin users began to fade. Until a few months before he left, he was responsible for creating the majority of the bitcoin protocol, only rarely accepting contributions.[11]
The whole thing is a good read.
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:10:06
One point that is quite true (currently) is about not spending them when they could go up so much.  I'm in that camp.  When I do want something, I purchase more bitcoins at market rate and make a quick purchase.  But I keep my (meager) stash the same for this very reason.  Why would I want to pay for something with Google stock when it is climbing like crazy?  I'd want to pay with my Facebook stock instead.  But in this case, I also see that as a relatively temporary thing while bitcoin "matures."

Tough call.  BTC is not trading as wildly as it was, but could at any time.  I like Gold, but it isn't like it doesn't trade wildly also.  Silver as well.  But they are more traditional places to protect wealth, so I'd give them the edge.  If I had $100,000 that I wanted to protect, I'd likely go with $70k in gold, $20k in silver, and $10 in BTC.
