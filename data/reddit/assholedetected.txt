Satoshi didn't pick 10 minutes at random, and obviously there is no "optimization" needed to get to 1 minute, it's just a parameter any noob can change, and that's what they do, but for marketing reasons only.
If you have any arguments for why 1 minute is better than 10, you can always join  enlighten them, and have the protocol changed.

USD monetary base:
- July 2013: 3314.2 billions
- July 2014: 4313.6 billions
4313.6 - 3314.2 = 999.4
999.4 / 3314.2 * 100 = 30.16
That's a 30% increase for you Mr. Troll. Try harder.

Thanks for the coins, stupid!

You could start by not destroying entire countries just because they want to sell their own oil for euros instead of dollars.

The only ways I can think of for these coins to be stolen are:
- State-sponsored super virus able to jump air gaps
- Operation to add a physical keylogger (though I could notice it)
- Torture

Check out Cryptsy.com and other places that list coins, there are hundreds of coins, and they never stop coming.
The only well thought, well designed, and battle hardened coin is Bitcoin, the other ones are just clones created by people who barely knew what they were doing. Their networks are crap, they have zero adoption, and nearly 100% of their users are script kiddies trying to get rich by spreading lies and pumping/dumping.

I don't see it either. Fake news?

People write fake stories all the time to get free BTC from good people like you. To discourage this behavior, you should never give money to random dudes on the internet just because they've told a sad story.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:45:54
You *are* wrong (and retarded). Max Keiser is right.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:56:57


Agreed. I think there was another CPU-only one called Securecoin.

Every time you spend coins, there is 1 more address that will stay empty forever.
Your comment was retarded.
And reddit is retarded for upvoting you.
No wonder altcoins are getting attention, we are dealing with a pack of irrational actors (also known as retarded actors).

I had lots of projects going on. I left most of them since they all now look like crap compared to Bitcoin. I tried to convince myself that I shouldn't put all the eggs in Bitcoin, that I should be smarter than that and continue to work, but failed. I can't even put more money into Bitcoin anymore, because the price went up so much that it wouldn't increase my stash in a significant percentage. So I'm just sitting here, watching the graph and bitcoin news all day :/. To relax from my new and stressful life I go to run, play ping pong, etc. And I feel like shit and lucky at the same time.

"It's more secure because scrypt"
Haha what a retard. Did you know that even the creator of scrypt said Litecoin "used scrypt poorly"? You clearly have no clue what you are talking about.


Go back to school, writing properly is important. That's not a "style".

I'm sure he would have gladly let you do the mining, but you obviously didn't offer your help, did you. You just waited until others risked their time and money to put the whole thing in motion.
