I'm testing out this idea with some restaurants here in Chicago.  
I'm Jonathan from [Chicago Mint Merchant Tools](
[Atlas Brewing Co.]( was the first establishment in Chicago to let us host an event where patrons could pay with Bitcoin.  It was a great success. People came out last week in -5°F / 20°C temperatures to spend their Bitcoin on some really awesome food and beer. [Read about it](
I plan on using [Coinbase]( and [Bitpay]( to get my customers set up with Bitcoin.  We used the Coinbase API to receive payments through a Ruby-on-Rails app for the Atlas event.  
In my experience, the greatest difficulty for a company (or individual) trying to act as a Bitcoin payments processor for a brick-and-mortar business,  is integrating with existing Point-of-Sale, accounting, and inventory practices. There are often systems in place that are unfriendly to Bitcoin, or create extra work.  I am working on solving this.
Taxes on revenues collected in Bitcoin sales work the same way as taxes for payments in cash, credit cards, or checks: you pay all the taxes.  Consult an attorney, especially one who "gets" Bitcoin.
Good Luck!

This is an open event! For those of you not on meetup.com, here are the details:
Hey Chicago Bitcoin People! 
Atlas Brewing Company will once again be accepting payment in Bitcoin on Tuesday, March 11th! The event begins at 6:30pm.
Yes, that is this upcoming Tuesday! Payments will be processed by Chicago Mint.
Remember, by spending Bitcoin at local businesses, you are helping our community by encouraging ALL businesses in Chicago to take a serious look at Bitcoin payments.
And for those of you who are new to the group, or just didn't take notice last time, Atlas is connected to the Seven Ten Lounge. That's right, we may be able to do some "Bowling for Bitcoin."
I hope to see you there!

If you are looking for something comprehensive, I highly recommend Revel Systems POS. 
You can accept "legacy" payment methods (credit cards, etc) as well as Bitcoin in one system. 
This is especially useful for restaurants, so your waitstaff doesn't need to take payments with two separate systems, etc.

This.  Chicago has an amazingly active and vibrant Bitcoin community.  Although we have fallen behind other cities with respect to merchant adoption, we are working hard every day to change this!  The community really is willing to go out of its way to support merchants who accept Bitcoin. We are like a fricken money-spending flash mob.
Kudos to the owner for doing this.  Let's hope he shares his positive experience with Bitcoin with other Chicago merchants to keep this adoption ball rolling.

Hi Olaf,
I'm fairly involved in the **Chicago** community, organizing community events and getting local merchants to accept Bitcoin.  I could be the perfect fit if you need a man on the ground in Chicago. 
Feel free to get in touch — Jonathan AT chicagomint

Check out [DigitalMint's]( Bitcoin Teller locations. A good number of DigitalMint's 250 locations labeled "Teller Location" on the website are located inside check cashing stores where you can cash your check and receive bitcoin all at the same counter.

The floating point argument is pretty compelling. Here's some excellent analysis from Vitalik (back when he was a still a bitcoin person) [ to support the magic behind the 21 million bitcoin limit

Bitcoin ATMs deliver bitcoin instantly (try that with most online services geared toward the banked class). Bitcoin ATMs / Tellers accept cash for bitcoin in an arms length transaction, however the Bitcoin ATM / Teller providers DO have a lot of overhead to run their businesses and provide INSTANT access to bitcoin to justify the higher fees. That being said, most companies are willing to offer lower fees for dedicated customers.
