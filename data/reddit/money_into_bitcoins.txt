It will be really bad, but I will manage it.

"If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry." - Satoshi Nakamoto
I believe you and I get it, Satoshi.

I'll have to disagree.
If luck is a big part of your investment, its a gamble. Also, if you put your money in something don't understand, you are gambling.
I do understand bitcoins and at this point, I do not believe that luck is a major part of bitcoins success. Its here, its working, its better than the alternatives

And what if I told you: you are an early adopter.

Laypersons will not buy bitcoins directly. They will instruct their bank to invest % of their money in bitcoin.
The way Circle shows USD amounts is the right way for laypersons to "invest in bitcoins". And this is only the first step towards mass adoption.
Not only that.... in 5 years you will be able to tell people that you actually owned a real bitcoin yourself. Yes, without any bank or company holding it!
Of course people will be able to do the same, but for much smaller amounts than 1 full gold bar. Oops, i mean 1 full bitcoin.

Posts like yours are just an evidence for myself that people still DONT GET IT.
I frequently ask myself why the valuation of Bitcoin is only 6 Billion Dollars, since Many shitty companies get higher valuation.
Thanks for reminding me why.
You can read the quote again to see why I don't address the issues at this point. Do as you will.

That is such a stupid comparison.
God = You can't see. You have to believe in it based on pure faith.
Bitcoin = Open source. Everyone can see it and conclude their own opinion, or at least know that very smart people read and are still reading the bitcoin code.
I do not believe that Satoshi is god and I do not follow him blindly, like certain religious groups.
I believe the invention itself not based on faith but rather on understanding of the fundamentals.

i think people are over-valuating shitcoins and ICO-scams.
bitcoin is the king.
it will soon to be remembered, by those who have forgotten.

i'm not bragging. as you can see i am writing this post every year. i'm not encouraging anyone to do anything, i'm just telling my story.
in my personal life, i tried to tell people about bitcoins many years ago, but most of them didnt believe me and thought this is too crazy. most of the people i have told about bitcoin didnt buy a single coin in 2013-2014 although i tried very hard to convince them. so after seeing that nothing will convince them, i stopped telling people about it, and started writing here about the fact that i believe in bitcoin and that i buy as much as i can. 3 years later and i think i was right about my estimation, and it feels very good to be right and persist in what you believe in, when most of the people around you try to discourage you.

Taking loans and investing with money that I don't have is not responsible. And I don't do that.
With money that I do have, I will invest the way I want. Thank you for your concern.

I'm not looking for "very responsible".
I'm looking for "somewhat responsible" and "life changing".
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:27:47
Its easy to be negative, but you are absolutely wrong.
The 50% price drop did not change my life at all. same occupation, same lifestyle.
Nothing severely negative or "life changing" has happened to me because of it.
