Nice... FYI, went to the site homepage and didn't see images?
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:39:19
This is still a challenge.  I constantly get transactions cacelled from coinbase AFTER they take my money and sit on it for more than a week.  Then it takes a week to get my money back after they have cancelled me.  I have had good success with [ and GREAT success with [ now with coinrnr you might need to contact them for large quanitities, but unlike coinbase... someone will respond to your queries usually that day.
FYI I buy and sell daily and belong to a mining club if you have any other questions.

I'm not an expert at Bitcoin, but I have had a lot of business experience with IRL companies and insolvency.  Often times companies are in positions of greater expenses than profitability but are able to "float" their bank accounts and leverage debt for a very long time before they finally go under - and leave all their vendors and clients hanging.  
I bet there was a lot of "creative" accounting going on at MtGox that contributed to their downfall... and possibly the Transaction Malleability was more for cover up.
I am sure the overhead of a company as large as MtGox and in their location was HUGE... and they were probably far from frugal as well.

no doubt it will be messy, but lucrative.  This is the first time we have had a currency which increases in value adding to the problem.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:59:26
Yeah, this is very very commercial... maybe not a go for reddit, but this is a great commercial idea.  I can see this application all across the web.  Some will hate it, some will love it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:12:16
LOL... yup, same here.  From day one I avoid Gox.  I guess there was plenty of writing on the wall even for a Bitcoin newb
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:53:12
Well, it's likely you won't be doing millions of dollars in BTC right off the bat.  So you should be able to take a slow approach to it, you might even be able to hanlde the trasfer of BTC to FIAT yourself.
Other wise you can set up a Bitpay or Coinbase account for instant conversion.
I personally use the Blockchain APIs to conduct sales and payments.  It's quite simple, but I am not sure if you can add PHP into Bigcommerce.  You could however create some unique pages on a seperate server and bring them into Bigcommerce as iframes.
 use the wallet api
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:38:51
Ok, you get where I was going.  Accept that I would never qualify to use the computers, if one were able to focus all those GPU's, would they be able to cash in?
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:41:50
like MurderousKirk said, and also I think there is a little feedback from IRS classifying as a "property" causing a little chaos if one were to track their captial gains and report.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:59:40
Here is a post with a Image that you can probably use/modify 
EDIT: oops, also I like [Bitpay.com]( for the instant conversion.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:48:39
Can you just import or swipe into your blockchain.info address?  Also email blockchain... they have always been quick to reply to me (usually within a day)
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:58:35
I think you might have to wait it out and be patient (or use EUR or JPY).  In the mean time, BTC is cheap... you could buy some more at another exchange like [coinbase.com]( (more reputable, although I have had issues with them) or even better join a mining club like [ and get coin daily
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:21:48
Every time Bitcoin drops... I buy more!
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:06:49
Good looking out.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:18:26
Man, I had serious trouble with coinbase... they would take money out of my account and then after about 1 week decline my purchase and I would not see my money for about 2 - 3 more weeks!!!
I don't think they are a bad company, just they are grabbing the tiger by the tail.  Their customer service was horrible also,  I would send them an email and get no response for 3 to 6 weeks... literally!
Go with a mining club where you can get BTC daily.  You will end up with more than you pay for in the long run.  
This mining club has their daily distributions published in their FAQ section.  [
FYI I have also used [ and sometimes it works great and other times it's sloooooow!
I also use [ and that one has been a lot of fun because of the diversity. 
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:19:13
[coinrnr.com]( I have made deposits (cash) to their bank and had coin within minutes.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:34:45
Agreed, but I like how QT can set a lower transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:34:07
At least he is honest about what he knows (doesn't know).
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:39:23
I personally prefer the [Bitcoin QT]( wallet.  it let's you adjust your fees to some extent.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:51:30
No one knows for sure.  For me I just stick to the QT wallet and I joined a mining club so I get coin daily.  Initially I had a couple hangups with exchanges so now I just avoid the exchanges.  I might go back to the exchanges in a year or two when they get it together.
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:02:48
I am currently trying to position myself to ONLY purchase from vendors who accept bitcoin.  I am talking to my local grocery stores and whichever one accepts bitcoin first is the one I will shop at exclusively.  this is another way to ensure that bitcoin hits critical mass.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:54:59
Good looking out!  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:43:32
I'm on an opera browser and no product images show up at all??
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:35:30
I have had great success with [ and it's fast... I got my bitcoin within literally an hour of signing up.  
Coinbase has given me nothing but grief and their customer service is non-existent.
Also as for physical coins... these are hard to come by... think about a cold storage paper wallet from this tutorial [bitcoinmenow.com Bitcoin-cold-storage-instructions-for-beginners](
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:01:06
I'll give it a shot... How do you know to send the winnings to my wallet address?  I didn't see any type of login?
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:26:55
Are you asking systemically (no) or for storage convenience?  Because I just saw a multiple coin wallet on reddit.  I'll try and find the link and post later.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:12:54
I subscribed! "if you can see these trends, where all this is going" -- yup!
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:48:19
Network effect!!
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:50:58
I'm sure you could ask, but I have never been able to get hold of anyone at Coinbase.  Opportunity?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:25:03
The letter was way over my head, but it reminded of seeing lower level employees with amazing ideas getting shot down by upper management.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:11:10
That would be my speculation, but if you are completely insolvent, and barely hanging on... then any type of "boat rocking" will sink you for sure.  Some companies have come out of the red e.g 7-eleven, circle k, Chrysler.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:46:27
You should focus on how everyone is mad that earlier adopters or miners are benefiting.  Seems the general population is OK with huge corporate banks making millions of dollars on the people, but heaven forbid a bitcoiner should make a couple dollars.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:47:50
Good read.  Here's another about CyrptoCurrencies (sp) 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:09:10
No worries... I was just bringing it to your attention.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:38:04
Hedge fund manager shocked... That's shocking.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:29:46
Thanks for sharing.  Would be nice to see any vids where he talks about some of his consulting with banks and such.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:44:57
Ok so when I send you 1 mBTC you use the wallet address I used to send the mBTC?
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:57:47
I do agree having multiple wallets is a pain, but multiple CryptoCurrencies is a must IMHO.
My reasoning is that currently I use Cash, Check or Seven different Credit Cards to exchange value today... sometimes even paypal, wire transfer or electronic check.
Multiple CryptoCurrencies mean there will always be an alternative should something happen with the primary currency, and also the others may offer something better.
My initial Biggest concern with BTC was that there was only going to be 21 million ever made.  A single bank could buy them all and then what?  With multiple currencies you have a safeguard against someone "buying the market" kinda like buffet did with silver back in the day.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:40:30
even for Alts?
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:33:39
Good for Kolin, what a stud!
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:02:27
Why not just join a mining club like [ or were you looking to build a super farm?
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:52:08
anything is possible I guess, but it seems more likely that they are holding the tiger by the tail and we are still in the embryonic stages of crytpocurrencies... so there are going to be some screw-ups from time to time... and srew-offs too.

Avast says "A threat has been detected"...
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:35:26


ignorance (meaning they haven't researched MtGox) and not enough good options.  Seems quite an opportunity to start a good exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:06:18
This is a clear example of why you can have garage startups that grow to the size of Google.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:57:57
If you are going to build and host your own site may I suggest using [wordpress]( with a [woocomerce plugin](
This would allow you to easily set up a full shopping site and then manage the site daily.  I think there are even several BTC plugins available.
PM me if you need more help.  I'm a web developer.
FYI you can get adeveloper cheap here:
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:21:18
Me too... I usually make several flash copies of wallets and store in separate places.  Paper wallets - I make several copies, store in separate places.  
It's funny, I never took these precautions with my fiat currency... but I have lost fiat currency hundreds of times LOL

Very good to know!

JP morgan's trolling!
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:15:29
These guys have some good graphs [bitcoinwisdom.com](  and probably a CSV file download possible.  
Also, hit up Kyle @ [bitcoinmenow.com]( he is very knowledgeable on BTC and he is always up for an interview.  He might help you get a long way ahead!!  Would love to see the thesis when you're done!!! 
Maybe try Andreas @ [blockchain.info]( although he might be impossible to reach as I see him doing a lot of interviews!!
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:21:28
Agreed with pcp-ip...  The two should be separate, but I suppose JPM might be trolling the net looking for customers to "bust"... sounds like something a bank would do.
If you attached a exchange account (like coinbase) to your JPMChase account then there would now you have money going to and from coinbase, but still shouldn't be related to your site.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:23:06
70% is a pretty large default rate!  Can you share how you were picking loans to invest in?  I am curious to see if you just picked whatever was in front of you or if you had a particular pattern.  Mainly I just am wanting to see if there are things to avoid or borrower types to avoid.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:39:12


Yeah, they don't listen. pfff, they are only on your post chatting with you right now LOL.  I was taking this post seriously initially, now I realize your just a troll.  
Do you even have an account?  Prove it, what's your link?
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:04:53
Agreed, btcjam has made tremendous changes in the last couple months and there are even bigger changes in the works right now.  They still have plenty of things to fix, but I now think they will do it and become the google of Bitcoin P2P.
Sorry, seeing your new concession I take me previous "troll" comment back.  My apologies.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:30:09
The autoinvest feature is actually pretty cool but like all things BTC it will improve over time.  I was actually building my own "auto invest" about the same time they released this feature so I stopped my project.
I have seen you on for a while now, so I definitely respect your views and opinions.  I would like to say the things you suggest for BTCJam to improve (collateral tied, filtering, etc) I have actually discussed with BTCJam Support (a month or two ago) and they are in the process of tackling all of these.  Their customer support and response time is actually really good considering how volatile and filled with trolls this Bitcoin World is.
My two Satoshis for what it's worth.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:21:13
Don't tip me... just wanted to say love what you are doing!!
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:39:02
This is likely the best and most thorough reviews I have seen of any of the P2P lending platforms.  I am going to dive in on payday.
Thanks for the share.

LOL... I was being serious.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:59:30
I'm not sure about the time frame; could be 1 year, could be 20... but you are correct.  I don't think I will ever sell, but I will buy stuff with bitcoin.  Just like I do today.
