Agree, they need to go back to the drawing board to be competitive with S7 antminer

its good for Bitfinex, basically if anytype of law enforcement ask for info about you they will give everything know about you.
and 
reading between the lines, " if law enforcement request your funds to be freeze, i believe they will do it to"
however i believe if you dont wire your bank $$$ into/out Bitfinex account and if you dont verify your ID with Bitfinex ( which is not required, only when you wire Cash in/out of Bank account) you should be fine. you can take care of most your daily/weekly expense via giftcards, small cash account w/local bitcoins. 
when you want to cash out large sum you can work with someone on Local Bitcoins for the wire, this way it will dramatically reduces your chances of your funds on Bitfinex to be Freeze. because the wire is not with Bitfinex.
