If anything, it’s being accepted at less businesses now and in the future.

A fool and his money...  you realize that the entire btc market is rigged?
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:44:14
The thing is, they know as little about bitcoin and it’s future investment possibilities as you do - it is 100% pure gambling and there is no such thing as investing in it.  
You may know more about how it works technically, but you and Betty have the same odds of long term success with it.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:04:30
Losing 50% of its value in a few days is a bubble popping.  It will happen again.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:51:30
You don’t know much about investing, do you?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:48:23
That isn't how that works.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:01:50
Calculated how?
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:03:44
Because you do...
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:50:15
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:58:14
You really shouldn’t be gambling (you probably call it investing) unless you’re ok losing everything.  You’ve got no clue what you’re doing.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:01:33
You’ve just made up a number you like.  It isn’t worth $10,000 based on infrastructure and users (lol wtf).  It is worth what people are willing to pay for it because that is literally all it is good for.  Gambling.  Speculation.  It has no intrinsic value.   
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:55:03
Yeah... it either goes up or down.  You’ve got a 50% chance of “knowing” what it will do.  It is going to crash much, much harder soon and you’re a complete idiot if you think you’ll become a millionaire for buying worthless things.

The rhetorical question was aimed at someone who self-admittedly lost a fortune from the original dotcom bubble and who is currently up on bitcoin.  
Your second sentence is vague enough to make you sound rather stupid, unless you'd like to explain it.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:44:48
That's just sad.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:53:35
Yes, I think they could have a large place in the future.  
It doesn't require gambling to get rich quick in order to help shape that future though.  Do you think that the perceived value of bitcoin going up has some correlation to its overall acceptance in the world?  Because it doesn't.  That's called speculation.

They redirected to a blank page to take the load off their servers.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:38:55
That's hilarious.  Except you said, "way better than 50/50."  Man, everyone should take their investment advice from this guy!  He's basing things on *logic*.  
I understand the system and the market:  bitcoin is a purely speculative commodity.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:39:30


Minus the part where almost everywhere in the world will accept it as currency, and that *a government will always accept it as payment for debt*.  Yeah, based on ... nothing...  vs. bitcoin, which is actually based on ... nothing.  
Holding bitcoin as a hedge vs. holding gold as a hedge...  you might be crazy to choose one over the other.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:06:59
It sounds like a fucking religious cult in here.  People saying they are building tomorrow; no you're fucking gambling and trying to make money by doing nothing.
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:02:30


I agree with this, but I don't think *anyone* who does chart analysis or trades on small time horizons has *any fucking idea* what they are doing.  It is always gambling.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:28:49
No gamble is way better than 50/50.  You're basing that on past performance and religious following
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:05:09
You're addicted to gambling.  Get help.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:45:52
Not as bad as I've seen before.  There are actually people doubting the future of bitcoin, given the circumstances.  Doesn't make them right, but they exist.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:08:47
You keep saying that as if we are in a defined location.  is a place on reddit to talk about bitcoin.  There is no rule that says you can't talk about the downsides and criticize it.  
You're free to leave, too.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:53:52
And could end up being the worst yet.  This is highly speculative; you're gambling.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:24:52
What's your point?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:36:51
My agenda is trying to inform people of something that is a roll of the dice being disguised as, "the next future hope for the world."  
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:16:15
Yes.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:04:23
You were playing online poker gambling 3.0.  What did you expect?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:01:39
Here?  Reddit?  I arrived here from .  You seem to be having trouble dealing with criticism.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:32:54


That's interesting.  You only want people commenting here that are bullish to your investment?  Why not just go in the bathroom and look in the mirror saying, "We're gonna be rich!!!"  Don't want to hear anything to the contrary?  


Increasing and decreasing rapidly.  Volatile.  Not stable.  Not a good currency.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:31:01
Deflationary currency is a bad thing.  Sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:40:34
The point is that you learned nothing from a bubble in the past and you don't recognize that you're in the exact same situation as before.  This is a speculative commodity market based on approximately *nothing* tied to real life.  House money is still money, and can very easily go to zero.  If you were in early why not cash out and take the profits?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:31
Religion does that.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:42:24
Good point, most people that gamble with bitcoin tend to be caught up emotionally... sounds like vegas
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:58:49


You're missing my point.  If you see bitcoin for what it is:  a highly speculative commodity that could drop to 0 tomorrow and that has had several insanely volatile days/weeks, then it is fine.  
The problem is people in this sub think of it as Jesus the savior of the evil world and something with zero problems.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:49:18
Enjoy losing lots of money in the future.  
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:50:07
Because he isn't stupid.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:08:09


Not a technical issue, but it speaks volumes about BTC being a stable store of value (which it isn't).  
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:08:31
You're treating this like gambling (call it investing if you prefer), which is exactly why it is failing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:44:09
It is most definitely *not* a currency right now any more than monopoly money.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:38:47
He’s either lying or stupid - none of that would happen 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:55:59
Sorry, no.  A currency needs to be "generally in use" to be called a currency, by definition.  
Bitcoin is some insanely tiny fraction of a percent and a joke as a currency.  Just because you and some other kids barter with it occasionally, 99% of the transactions are speculative investments and not transactions for goods &amp; services.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:09:09
Posts like this show a few things:  
Bitcoin is pure gambling  
Bitcoin users have no fucking idea how finance works  
Bitcoin will never be a currency  
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:29:57
I also don't buy lottery tickets - tax no the dumb and whatnot.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:09:03
No one has any idea what will happen, so it isn't FUD.  It is just as much FUD to think bitcoin will be going way back up anytime soon as it is to be pessimistic.  This place sounds like a religious cult.

i just realized this is partly why it go so popular, especially with socially awkward people.  they can finally feel like a big shot "trader" and think they are smart because it's "crypto" ...  oh god the cringe 
@_date: 2018-07-13 14:30:15
You're dumb no matter the outcome. It's like the special olympics.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:44:11
Ok, thanks for clarifying.  I was hoping someone on this forum had thought about this point since it is a pretty big deal, and just because it goes in the face of the last 100 years of economics, doesn't necessarily mean it is a good idea.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:14:12
Are there any well written blogs/posts about why a deflationary currency is a *good* thing?  I'm honestly asking.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:11:51
You can't time markets fueled by irrational human behavior.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:50:03
Limits on trades != central regulation.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:57:17
I'm not sure if you're saying bitcoin isn't deflationary, or if you understand that it is, and are saying that is a bad thing.
