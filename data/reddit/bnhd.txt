This is the type of stuff you’re going to hear on r/Bitcoin at the exact time you should be accumulating.
@_date: 2019-01-07 14:24:53
I am talking about [Ledger]( the creators of the Ledger Nano S. They accept Bitcoin as a payment method to purchase their products but only through BitPay.
BitPay uses unique addresses making it hard to send Bitcoin from most Bitcoin wallets (Including the Ledger Nano S itself) and displays inaccurate fee rates for the Bitcoin network.
I sent them an email asking them is they plan to switch payment processors and their support proceeded to tel me that BitPay is the only available payment processor, which is completely false.

Hey as long as it makes you happy
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:47:28
It’s the same thing as Bitcoin except:
It is heavily influenced by multiple bad actors in the space. The community is very hostile and troll-like as well, their main talking point is BTC and trying to destroy its image.
It has a fraction of the transactions and user base participating on the network. Check out [Transaction Highway]( for a visual representation.
Its block size increase which was the source of heavy debate will eventually result in heavy centralisation as the average miner is pushed out of the market and only larger companies are able to successfully mine the next block. Could you imagine how risky that would be if a large fraction of the world used Bitcoin as a payment method and store of value?
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:58:49
It would just get sprayed over and we wouldn’t know if it was the original creators or not.
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:17:08
Where do you grab your list of currencies from?
I agree it is an easily inflatable metric, but is it so easy to do that for a coin as large as Bitcoin?
My apologies, I believe it is an important thing to watch as it indicates when then market has decided to sell altcoins for BTC, which I believe to be a bullish sign. If I am wrong then I don’t want to mislead anyone with my error, why exactly is it not important when Bitcoins dominance rises?

Sending Bitcoin is actually possible without an internet connection, although complicated the possibility is there. Internet usage will only increase as time goes on though, so I do not think this will be much of an issue.
Basically what I was trying to say is I can’t wait for the day that a majority of the population has a wallet capable of sending and receiving Bitcoin instantly, we are *almost* there with the technology, we are still a while away when it comes to adoption and usage from the average person.
I think we both agree on everything.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:47:45
Every single time I see BitMex I think it says Bitmillex and I get excited.
One day...
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:29:50
I’m fully aware that you can send a lot of cryptocurrencies instantly, even Bitcoin with Lightning Network. I was just making the point that it’s “not as easy as sending a text”, yet.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:06:05
Thought you said Bitmillex, was pleasantly surprised for a second there.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:07:36
How exactly am I a shill? Because I had this account for 7 weeks?
Great observation. As much as you don’t want to believe it I’m a real person with a real opinion that has been in the space for quite a while now, I’m sure you would believe it if my opinion was in line with yours.

I want as many updates on how the Bitcoin network is going as I can possibly get. Obviously there is a degree to this, but these type of posts are exactly what the community should be talking about.
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:22:38
Is me getting bitcoin and sending it to my friend (directly, not through a centralised exchange or wallet service) really as easy as sending a text right now? It isn’t because they don’t have a wallet I can send it to.
That aside, I’m talking about instant. If I send my friend some BTC to go to buy something at the store he will have to wait for confirmation before he can spend it, then the place he is spending is must actually accept it. We are a long way away from it being a seamless easy to use technology for the masses. People don’t know how the internet works but they would be damned without it, that is what Bitcoin will be like for the masses. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:55:20
Seriously though we have a long road ahead of us to get to $1,000,000 USD per BTC, how about we do that first?
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:07:00
Commenting just to say please use something other than BitPay, they are intentionally making it difficult to spend bitcoin via their platform.
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:09:07
That’s why I said “sadly”. Because you can’t.

Where exactly did I say what kind of wallet I use?

It depends on the person, some people need these videos as a quick and easy introduction.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:58:23
This is basically a “step one” introduction video and I think it does quite well at that. It introduces you to the fact bitcoin does not have a bank / third party facilitating transactions, it’s cheapness to use, scarcity as a digital asset and put it all in a short animated video.
When introducing people to bitcoin you can’t hop straight into the technical things, you have to give them an idea of what it offers to do then explain how it offers to do that.

@_date: 2018-07-09 00:50:18
That could also end badly, especially with the price being as seemingly low as it is now. If you were ever going to sell to buy back in it should’ve been done in Dec/Jan and you should be buying back in around about now continuing to dollar cost average throughout the next few months or so.
@_date: 2018-07-25 08:48:46
Bitmillex is a cryptocurrency exchange built around having top security as one of its main focuses. They also implement heaps of features to help trade like trade signals, auto trade, a debit card, P2P marketplace, P2P lending and more.
It’s currently in ICO stage but I personally see it as a golden nugget of an ICO. Check out the [working mvp]( to get an idea yourself.

Nice subtle Bcash shill. But something like this will be entirely possible on the lightning network, the only difference is I will be using a decentralised, censorship resistant, immutable ledger instead of a soon-to-be centralised alt-coin.

The website says “We give a 100% guarantee of daily profit for lifetime.”
I don’t even need to say anymore, that sums it up.
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:25:39
I know it’s a cliche at this point but I would much rather hear about this than the price going either direction. This right here is the indicator that the technology is still growing and not even at its full potential yet. I cannot wait for the day my wallet can be integrated into my phone and I can transfer money as easily as I can send a text message to a friend.
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:59:31
BCH won’t ever be fully accepted by even the crypto currency community due to the way it planted itself at the beginning.
They tried to push off Bcash on their website as Bitcoin (BCH), whilst listing Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core (BTC). The bitcoin.com wallet on the App Store is blatantly trying to convince people that Bitcoin Core even exists. It’s nothing but a client.
If the article even mentions the words “Bitcoin Core” you already know its going to be packed with hostility towards Bitcoin and you need to take what they say with a grain of salt.
I wish Bcash good luck with its severe lack of developers, lack of foresight and temporary scaling fix, it’s going to be hilarious to watch.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:06:24
It’s already begun.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:03:55
So if you only have bitcoin then what else are you going to buy food with then?
You say bitcoin won’t be successful as a currency because it’s only going to increase in value, but it isn’t going to increase in value unless it is being a successful currency too.
There is a reason everyone isn’t selling their fiat currency even when they know its value will decrease and there will be reasons for people to spend their Bitcoin when the know it’s going to increase in value too.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:42:23
I’ve been meaning to test out the lightning network haha
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:41:26
Why would anyone hold fiat when they can hold bitcoin if it’s deflationary?
We are just going around in circles here.
Bitcoin will one day not be rising and falling like it has been since its creation. It’s deflation rates will be minuscule compared to what has already been happening.
The average joe will not starve himself to death just because the only currency he will have to spend on food is going to be worth a tiny fraction more in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:10:19
Well you’d be wrong. The beginning isn’t when it starts to become noticeable, the transition to using the internet began well before 10% of the world started using it.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:26:30
My point is simply that it has begun, nobody knows if it’s going to succeed or not.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:08:16
Bitcoins deflationary aspect will not eliminate spending all together, rather it will lower unnecessary spending. You will have less people “living and spending above their means” in a scenario where bitcoin is a successful currency.
This argument is also a bit of a paradox in the sense that if you truly believe that bitcoin won’t succeed because it’s going to rise in value, why aren’t you putting your money into bitcoin now? 
Let me ask you why would anybody try and save their money if its going to lose value every year? Hard question to answer but as you can see it is what a lot of people continue to do.
It’s hard to see that world and what it looks like right now, but when we get there you won’t see people starving themselves, missing rent when it’s due and in general making their lives impossible to live simply because their money is going to be worth 1-3% more in a year.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:18:43
Okay but in the scenario where:
- Bitcoin is spendable everywhere fiat is spendable
- You have the option to get payed in either your national fiat currency or Bitcoin
Tell me why you would hold fiat at all?

Thank you I truly appreciate this.
