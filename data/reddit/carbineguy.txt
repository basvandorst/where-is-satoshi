That’s even worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:10:15
Historically, this hasn’t worked out for most people lol.
Either futures next week will make this bet, or break it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:08:22
Got some at $14k or so! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:53
Isn’t IOTA run by some really scummy people, or am I thinking of a different coin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:51:04
Decentralization and distribution are two different things. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:40:47
ACASH ACASH ACASH!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:18
I was in around $4k. I've been dollar cost averaging ever since. Only one of my buy positions is down at this point, still way over 100% this year. 
HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:10
And then it dropped back $5k immediately. I feel bad if anyone managed to get a buy order in. People were just arguing on Facebook saying “Korea and Japan love Bcash!” And I said “Why?” And they said “I just gave you a reason”
Anyone who’s been in crypto for even a day could see that that was not organic growth. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:39:57
Bought $75 after it crossed $4k, plan on putting $50 in next week and continuing to do so. No regrets. HODL. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:29:08
So if I currently have a small amount of bitcoin in Coinbase, what would be the safest alternative? Is there one? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:38:01
Someone else may have better insight on this, I use Coinbase. My understand is it's not bad, but it's not the safest. People seem to think that *maybe* what happened to MtGox will happen to coinbase. And not much verification is required to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:42:30
So either he makes a small fortune, or he 'loses' none of his money. Perfect. Make sure to tell him to HODL! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:24:21
Yes. Some guy got drunk on a forum and was like 'HODL!'  And so the joke ensues. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:20:26
New to this, but is Coinbase safe? Relatively? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:56:44
Can you elaborate? Wasn't aware of what happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:28:56
Congrats all you hodlers! History. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:04
$10,600+ now. Forget $10k. Apparently that was like running through finish line tape for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:25
CORRECT PLEASE, I WANT MORE 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:11:28
Have you visited r/investing? Five months ago, that was a hot topic, and it still comes up, although these days you can feel the pain when users respond with “it’s actually bad idea, don’t do it” 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:17:12
There's always a wall right before a major milestone. The last couple haven't been bad, but I remember $5k, coinbase did the same thing. There's a lot of sell orders right before $10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:34
It hit the reset button apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:04:38
Quit posting the same comment to every single thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:12:17
I can’t see the sell orders other’s have set, but I’ve seen a lot of people on various forums with sell orders between $9.9k and $10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:33:54
My understanding that is a lot of the time, it's such a great cost it isn't worth it, unless you have a legitimately large rig to mine from. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:31:28
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:24:02
Typical. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:32:28
What year did you time travel from? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:23:59
Can I move my coins from Coinbase to breadwallet? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:57:28
Bought the fking dip 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:48:00
Went to $4,275 (that I saw) and back up over $4,400 within maybe 30 mins for me. Looks like plenty of people BTFD
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:14:01
So you're waiting a month to dump all your money in? Why not now? We're about to cross $5k. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:41:53
Aaaaand it's gone hahaa 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:13:59
Interesting! Thanks! I knew obviously that USD inflated, but wasn't sure if Bitcoin would experience any unique challenges that fiat currency hasn't due to it's finite nature. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:08:34
Didn't know that! 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:26:51
The moon. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:33:36
Breadwallet is pretty secure. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:24:25
We all love bitcoin here, but I think even this scares most people. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:22:51
Someone said 5k by Thursday...I’m thinking Wednesday now if we keep this up. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:49:07
$4,430. Everyone already BTFD. Move along folks. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:26:22
And how do I do that?
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:08:45
What wallet did you use?
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:59:07
People always say "it's crazy that you think bitcoin can hit 100k" but percentage wise, the journey from a couple dollars to where we are at *now* is crazier than $4.9k to 100k 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:32:51
Oh so there are 21 million *to be issued*, but there is unlimited mining potential? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:29:36
I have breadwallet. How do I transfer my coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:01:51
Fuck. I’m so sorry. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:46:56
What method are you trying? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:53:38
I have both accounts set up. How would I proceed? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:16:47
Not going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:23:43
Got it. Not jailbroken any more, haven't even tried on my current phone. I'll try all this. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:46:01
While my BTC has done really well (obviously) my mutual fund account is 25% YTD. Can't complain about either. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:26:53
Yes 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:35:26
The China stuff will take time to die down completely. It'll dip further for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:02:20
How much fluctuation do you see on a given day on average? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:26:48
Coinbase! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:51:34
So how can a currency that is finite be better overall than a currency that is infinite? Wouldn't the value of bitcoin essentially have a ceiling then? Whatever that number may be? 
EDIT: When I say infinite, I'm just comparing bitcoin to USD, where you can print more money. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:49:41
Yup! Now jump on the train! Quick!
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:08:44
Buy a little here and there. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:32:48
Where's John McAfee?!
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:12:46
Coinbase! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:18:03
Probably bread wallet, but maybe someone else can weigh in. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:06:12
Some guy posted in here with just over 8 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:45:49
Thanks!! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:48:18
So what happens (or what do we think will happen) when all 21 million bitcoins have been issued?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:46:42
My price alert woke me up at 1AM. I've never been so happy to be woken up. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:52:01
Alright, bit of a novice-esque question here: I have some BTC in Coinbase, do I need to do anything, and if so, what? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:48:57
Has anyone in there actually retired or reached FIRE off of Crypto? I haven't seen any posts, but I think it's funny to imagine a sub literally filled with basically millionaires always congratulating each other on their wealth, and then them shitting on someone because they did it a different way in a shorter amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:43:02
Yeah, I’m scared of this again. I watched it hit $4,980 and then plummet. People start selling. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:34:33
Got my private key just written down and hidden. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:42:08
How do you throw not fiat money???
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:27:41
I’d prefer to just use bread wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:27:05
I have breadwallet. How do I transfer my coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:19:35
It is, crossing my fingers it lasts. The two years prior were dismal at best. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:04:21
Maybe I should rephrase...is there any risk? I realize that there are safer places to have my BTC than Coinbase, yes, but I’m talking specifically about the hard fork.
