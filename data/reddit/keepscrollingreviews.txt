Hodling 30 coins, hodling 30 grams.

Just fucking give up. It's going to crash and you hodlers will have nothing left.

Is that why this split thing I have heard of happens.  It enough coins so they are split. You own the same amount in worth, but the units doubled. Like a stock essentially, is it that simple?

I have a AMD MSI 390 8GB used sitting in box. I hate selling stuff on Craigslist so that's why it sits there. I have an old PC not being used either, just hooked to me tv for movies I torrented. 
Is it worth me actually learning to mine with them?

Everyone but you guys here treated it as a quick in and out. It hit public knowledge, many knew about it, and. On its crashed hard, which means the public think it's worthless.

It's it's own device separate? Because I don't like the idea of using my phone which I'm doing currently. This phone will break down eventually.

Tonight at 11, a story of a New York man who robbed a 7 year old talent show winner, and ran into the streets make shouting about Bitcoin.

Just HODL and worry about it when you're rich.

Damn I need to get some more side capital and more coins before it gets too popular.
