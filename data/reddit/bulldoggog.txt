Within America they still have the same buying power - outside of America they are down 7% ... it’s more a reflection of America’s dollar starting to tank as the economy is gradually going down the shoot ... coupled with Chinas banks tanking in 2018 - very interesting times ahead for fiat currency ... so we run to bitcoin ? Who knows

Stop limits ?! Your sell price is dictated by the market willing to buy ?! If declines in the way it grew - who will buy you out ?

Wow- that is in no way a like for like example lol... it’s like saying no one goes to Starbucks because now you have to make your own coffee there ...

Winklevoss brothers bidding up the bitcoin exchange by transacting back and forth - anominously through the block chain technology .  I sell to you bro for $1000 then u sell back to me for $1100 , then I sell back to u for $1200 ... so on and so forth , all the while attracting the public speculators money to ride this wave of growth.... so much ease of manipulation through the very same technology that all the bitcoin fan boys think the bitcoin hedges against!   When the value per coin goes to less than $100 a coin - people can look back on this thread and realise how easily fooled they were ! It’s like the Wild West at the moment with crypto currencies - large scale pump and dump scheme - which is currently in full pump mode !

Do you think the energy inefficiency scaling was correct with the original author ? I love the idea of block chain but if it is to taxing on the environment then surely it’s not the way forward ?

I would estimate - .01 percent are using it as actual currency ... it is utterly useless for transaction under a $100 ?! The fees are to high and the time to execute is wayyy to long ... I have bitcoin but haven’t drank the cooolade - I am annoyed that all the speculators have come in and ruined my version of a new world order !

Would you be able to explain in detail the  key facts he has ignored please?

The undeniable advantage of bitcoin is its annominity.   I can buy in cash - trade - then cash out ... as for a new decentralised currency - it’s not going to happen with the current state of affairs ... fees r to high - execution takes to long ... Bitcoin is different to other alternatives as it is a closed loop with a predetermined amount of shares that actually deflate over time due to wallets and passwords being lost as time goes on ... scarcity drives any market ... it’s certainly an interesting time to witness the current level of interest in what is now a speculative investment ... who knows where it’s going but I’m pleased we live in a time where we are still free to dabble in things such as this ... what happens to tax on internal trades though ? Do business to business bitcoin trades miss out on having to pay there tax obligations ?  Things like this question make we wonder if whale investors have really thought it all out

Proof ? You have missed the point my friend , the transactions are able to be performed without transparency - so let that dynamic expand your mind 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:47:35
Perhaps not the winkkevoss brothers - perhaps anyone who has bitcoin - any 2 people with a vested interest in bidding up the market price could easily do it - think about it objectively
