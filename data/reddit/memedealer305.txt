@_date: 2018-01-27 23:45:08
Sure lets say that...
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:23:51
People over here talking about $100-300K like its nothing. When I first started I deposited and wired like $20 on Coinbase to see if it would go then went big
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:06:18
Pretty much anywhere you see Roger Ver be wary of a scam

Coinbase were pretty much already in shit by themselves. This just took them 10 feet under. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:39
Im thinking to move to Gemini from Coinbase but all of them crashed today with the price surge 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:12:01
F off and stop begging 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:42:11
Ohh alright that really clears it up, thank you so much bro! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:07:48
If you bought Bcash, just realize you got scammed and move on 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:57:30
Thats why I started out buying equal amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin the latter two I sold at a small profit and bought Bitcoin with that money and have been hodling it since. :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:39
Just price correction. All the newbies that hyped it up are now getting out
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:42:22
More like BShit
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:45:28
You really believe it will be that much? I’ll eat my left testicle like that other guy at 100K out of excitement
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:50:28
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:15:52
The only way they could track that wallet would be if Satoshi ever brought those coins to an exchange and cash out for fiat. Thats what I think!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:29:32
Why are you moving from Kraken to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:18:21
HODL Young One
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:35:31
$700 for a cool little monkey is a good deal though. Where can I find those cute and cuddly bastards 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:05:48
Good stuff, well said!

Look up a hardware wallet such as a ledger nano s or a trezor
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:39:54
It will definitely go up at first when that institutional money comes in but after that who knows. It might dip
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:20:35
Tai Lopez?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:25:19
Gemini seems like the general consensus, shall give that a try 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:04:30

Fucking con man Roger Ver spreading FUD on CNBC. Dont know why they keep giving him credibility and air time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:48:15
I dont know about you but I bought a hefty amount of Bitcoin at 3K which has grown very nicely and is about to make me completely debt free and give me financial freedom. So I dont know what you’re on about 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:34
How did you know about Bitcoin in 2003 when it was created in about 2009? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:44
BCash trading was prohibited for coinbase employees. So they said
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:53:52
Thanks for taking the time and giving me the explanation ��. The more research I do, the more I lean towards BTC. But like you said, time will tell! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:55:03

Hey guys new reddit user here. Just got into bitcoin couple months back! How much bitcoin are you guys holding? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:03:05
Man its unreal how all the other exchanges were down too. I know Coinigy and Kraken were not functioning as well, I thought it was a Ddos attack at first or something 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:09:27
