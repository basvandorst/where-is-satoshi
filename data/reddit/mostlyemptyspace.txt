What is expected to happen when the number reaches zero? Should it make the value of bitcoin go up or down?

So can you explain all of the significant forces that are contributing to this insane growth in bitcoin? Or are you just riding the wave like everyone else? All the bitcoin-heads I know kept talking about the fork. Well the fork didn’t happen and yet here we are. No one has been able to give me a good explanation for this other than it’s a runaway irrational market that people are jumping on simply because it keeps going up.

This is the thing that gets me. No one who invests in bitcoin is smart. There’s not some deep analysis of market forces going on here. People see growth and they chase it.
People who hold for a long time are simply either optimistic or stubborn. Whether or not they get rich or broke has zero to do with their intelligence.

Agreed. That’s why I am a passive investor. I have a diversified portfolio of Vanguard ETFs and a decent stake in real estate. I don’t own a single individual stock. I dollar cost average out of my paychecks and just get on with my life.
Sure, I may not win the lottery, but I’m gonna be fuckin set for an early retirement. That’s smart to me.

I don’t even check the value my portfolio, literally the shitposting on this sub is the only indicator I need to know how I’m doing.

Ok total newbie here. Is it too late to jump in? If not bitcoin, are there other coins that I should start with today?

As a gamer who is stuck with a 970, this video made me cringe.
