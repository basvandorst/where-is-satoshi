Well when I am done with my SMS based alternative, then yes Nokia 3310 will be able to make bitcoin transactions

 You better share 
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:49:31
I'll be nice and ignore it, very interesting though
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:07:15
As soon as I can get hold of all the necessary API and source I will be attempting this, I work at a S.A based company that deals in SMS/USSD etc so that helps a lot already. Any tips (knowledge) would be appreciated

*Whooosh* 
I was making a joke, a fail joke apparently...

When you put it perspective it's kind of funny how people can over react.

* They are made for mining bitcoins nothing more, thus the hardware is targeted at solving bitcoins unique hashes
* A DIY miner uses normal straight forward GFX cards that are not built to solve bitcoin hashes
* A mining rig, but start small 5ghash($270+-) can still generate a lot of BTC, use the generated BTC to buy more rigs, expand exponentially instead of blowing $3000 on a hope that bitcoin will ever be as strong as it was yesterday
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:09:13
Cool, thanks either way, it's a shame the rigs have so much potential at the moment, I guess the trick is just getting on-board before mining difficulty goes up

Would make sense if you are offering to give the incorrect parties coins to the correct party, but it seems like you are just trying to pull a fast one?
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:17:18
You can do it from brainwallet, under the transactions tab
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:36:47
Ohhhhh I wanna give it a shot! 1D2HrhGJhmoRE249MEnJcSJhN6ouJ3LDRw

I'm making a transaction (buying 0.1) as we speak, just to test it, seems pretty straight forward though
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:28:03
Maybe we can pay the lawyers with bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:32:55
I'm in a software development position that I can make something like this happen, I will read up on the bitcoin API's and get back to the subreddit in some time. It would be great to see something like this available but i'm not sure how you'd market it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:20:47
I'm close to completion on a sms system for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:12:45
 For person to person trade 
Also bidorbuy has a few sellers
I think the biggest problem is getting coins at the proper rate (bitx sells 0.1 for R211 +- the actual price is more like R160+-)

Twilio won't be necessary, already have access to all their features.
bitcoin-ruby, well I'm a c developer so not exactly my cup of tea but I'll have a look at it, at the moment i'm looking at using blockchain, their API is fairly simple
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:40:28
Maybe start with the [blockchain-api]( and just see if you can send and interpret responses 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:36:33
A quick update, I made a purchase of 0.1 btc at R300, it has been processed and in the meantime the selling price has also reached R300. Worth it!
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:30:36
To be honest it was a completely random string of words I entered, the chances of it being seen again isn't much, and to be honest I can't even remember what I typed in, after I closed the tab I couldn't find it again haha

My 5870 is mining at about 270mhash generating 0.6btc/pm current temperatures of 90c fan speed of 40%
GFX cards are made to take a lashing, i'd advise though that you avoid overclocking unless you have good cooling equipment. I wouldn't worry if your card temp is below 100 Celsius.
With dual 7970's you can expect upwards of 1Ghash/sec which ends up at about 1.96BTC/pm or at current exchange $346/pm
I'd recommend you mine now as much as possible and use your collected bitcoins to invest in a mining rig

Cool, A quick tip though make sure it's an instant EFT if he isn't with FNB and doesn't want to wait 2 days for the order to go through
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:18:17
I haven't heard anything good about brainwallet, so I avoid it personally
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:30:39
I am working on a bitcoin via sms system that is linked to the blockchain API, would be great if you can make it an option to trade with SMS (possibly secured by a registered cell number)
User - &gt; SMSs trade 1BTC (bank account details)
System processes at current weighted average or something along those lines and processes an eft payment
Edit:Formatting

I've got a feeling it's going to be a bit more involved, blockchains api is for registered users and the wallet codes linked to them. So you'll have to run each address through blockchain.info/address/-address- then scan the response for the right text area 
    &lt;span data-c="0"&gt;$ 0.00&lt;/span&gt;
    
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:53:47
Do you program? If you have a list of the wallet codes it can be done with code. If you can I will consider writing an app for you, a tip would be nice for the work
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:04:06
I'm a south african as well, and off topic, do you have any idea if there is a way to get decent mining rigs here from butterflylabs etc? I've got a small group of people going and the idea is to mine with GPU build up some capital and invest in a 5GH/s + mining rig.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:51:23
The First D in DDOS is for distributed- Correct!
Does that mean many people intentionally ran a DOS attack - NO All this means is that the attack originated from multiple IP addresses as apposed to one, which means 1 person with a large botnet can run a DDOS attack
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:52:51
Have a look at butterflylabs.com (but take note that it may take a few months if you order now) 
If you don't feel like waiting then have a look at  to choose the best GPU(s) for your needs
