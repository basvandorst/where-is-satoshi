I think comparing your furby to the Blockchain technology depicts a poor level of knowledge on the topic. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:46:02
How are you getting to that conclusion?
I use bitcoin to pay for my dairy products with my local farmer.
I use bitcoin to pay for the majority of my eating out expenses.
I send money to my family using bitcoin (international transactions).
The awareness around bitcoin is growing everyday -at least in my community.

Oh! That sounds legit. 


There's people in reddit that jumped on the train expecting to become rich overnight and that is not what I see in my community. In reality, I see people excited for participating in this experiment that has the potential to change the world as we know it.

Usually the best way is the simplest way. Get a trezor wallet. It is the safest and easiest way to do it. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:21:52


Feel free to start your new free off charge bitcoin wallet service and adress those issues.
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:55:35
How can paper wallet be above the trezor? Trezor is like having a tank in your living room plus child's proof. No way to fuck it up.

Bitcoin is my passion and nothing disgusts me more than the idea consumerism and its black Friday epitome. 
Still, I wish you good luck in your entrepreneurial adventure :)

You missed "Pinche gobierno de mierda".

I am long term holder and I can't think of how low it would need to drop before the idea of selling crosses my mind. However, I am still curious to know what makes you think this time will be the same as the previous ups and downs you have described?

Upvote because I like your name

If you believe you are going retire with a Usd account. That means two things:
1. You have misunderstood/missed the idea of the Blockchain invention. 
2. You are very unaware of how the economic system currently works, the crisis of 08 and the imminent collapse that is to come. 


I wouldn't bet a penny thinking the USD will save you from that. A good documentary to start is 'The inside job'. 
Let's get informed, let's change this fked up game. :) 
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:01:59
I recommend you to get read about the Blockchain protocol. That might give you some understanding of the bigger picture for this new technology and you might even be able to understand it's true potential. We are all early adopters at this stage. 


I feel like it's a waste of key strokes addressing your complaint. Good luck with that 
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:42:00
Where did you get the 15-25 year time frame for singularity? Not that I don't think it is possible. I am just curious.

Seeing that your comment has been down voted, makes me understand better the kind of community that participate in this sub.

What's wrong with saving?

I would be worried if a disruptive technology is not hated.

That's what they thought in Argentina.

It depends on what is your definition of 'failing'. The genie is out of the bottle and even if some terrible bug sends Bitcoin to the ground, Bitcoin 2.0 will be up and running the day after- a stronger and more robust protocol. That can't be a failure. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:19:20
Sounds like an arbitrary goal

I use Bitcoin to buy eggs from my local farmer. I send Bitcoin to my mom overseas and I also use it to pay at my two favorite restaurants in town. My next step is getting my renter to accept it. 
I see a significant difference in using Bitcoin as a currency for my daily needs versus using it at the black Friday madness were there's people in wallmart fighting for stuff the TV has made them believe they 'need'. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:10:31


Stable as the bright future of the US dollar?  
Good luck with that

Organic eggs with my local farmer (weekly) , bicycle repairs, food at my two favorite restaurants, hemp clothing. 
I personally know four others that do the same thing.

Sometimes I need to come here to remind myself that not everyone understands the fundamentals of why we need a technology like Bitcoin.

And here we have the main difference between those who make things happen and the rats that wait to jump off the sinking boat until the last minute.

I guess it's the nature of the sub. It's one or the other, Bitcoin explodes to the moon and beyond or it dies. Black or white. All pornsite operators are scumbags or not.
