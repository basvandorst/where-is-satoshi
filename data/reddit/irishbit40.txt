I have been writing a blog for over ten years about the corruption, fraud and harm to patients, by Big Pharma and its cohorts. I put up a donation option a while back but haven't received much (10 dollars), as its hard to write so much and invest so much time but I think the blog I write is important so I will keep doing it regardless. I also help people come off SSRI meds like Paxil, and I have done this for ten years also. Any donation or support would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
This is my blog :

ok thanks ! thanks for responding- how do I go about that?

I have done that, and it shows no transactions on the address, and the transaction is missing now from the multibit, but I am minus the BTC. My original address (that I set up to get the BTC in 2014) still has the (almost) full balance, so I don't understand what is happening. this is the address...

Just wondering also, if the transaction didn't go through- is it possible that the multibit wallaet is showing the wrong balance? (it is showing the balance minus the bitcoin that I sent to Blockchain- that never arrived) and if so, would the private key hold the correct balance? thanks for your help.

Thanks, I am hesitant though, I dont really understand what i am doing. If I export the private keys - will they have my full balance on them?

Is my private key in the data folder for Multibit? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:35:51
hanks, that is really good advice. Can I just take them out of the folder? I did that originally before I uploaded them into the Multibit. 
This is the original address
