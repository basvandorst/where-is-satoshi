He fully aknowledges Bitcoin the technology is amazing and he is also right in the context of investing, Bitcoin as a currency asset is too overhyped.
Bitcoin as a tradeable asset is too volatile and speculative to be considered a good currency if you live in a stable economy.  If you live in an economy in shambles Bitcoin the currency could be considered an interesting alternative...  
What Robinson is critically pointing out is the over promise of bitcoin as an investment when the vital fundamentals do not add up.
So what should we do?  Continue to use and develop ideas around bitcoin technologies and methods but stop with telling people Bitcoin is some kind of great investment.   If the bitcoin ecosystem is truly useful to people the price will be discovered in due time with much better fundamentals without double exponential rises and falls....

I read a report that said providers have confirmed that the passwords are old or the accounts have been banned.  They think its a collection of hacked emails from over the last few years.

I agree and am very pro bitcoin but I believe its long term success is tied to critical evaluation by the early adopters to take Bitcoin beyond a digital asset you trade at the exchange, invest in or worse.

No, the attitudes cultivated in here are the stupidity.
I do not care if bitcoin is worth $0.25 or $40,000.
Having to come into here and kow-tow all discussion to only those with unbridled naive enthusiasm is the ultimate in moronic community behavior....  thats the joke
Take your sock puppets off

The problem is not a discussion forum, it is a marketing forum for bitcoin.
Some people want a more rigorous conversation regarding all things bitcoin.

Try it and do not give up if they were late on delivery.
At least get the documentation going on inconsistencies in their promises and actual delivery.
**Paypal will try to help if anything goes against the seller agreement BFL had to follow to offer a sale via Paypal.**
Now, since BFL is in court you may not get anything anytime soon or at all but if there is anything redeeming to your situation at least you have something documented and started should it be possible even for a small window of time to get your money back.
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:50:56
Supporters of bitcoin should be skeptical to make it stronger and if becomes a marketing team channel instead of a discussion forum then there needs to be a better forum for those that choose to be critical.
The bitcoin foundation is doing the right thing to stay away from promoting Bitcoin and spending resources on critical work on the core system instead.

TLDR: QT trader bot is great and can be part of the complete trade platform Intution.io ecosystem is providing.  Backtesting is the science of testing strategies against historical data.  QT Bot is for trade execution activities and Intuition.io is a complete set of tools for in-depth research,real time trade rules and low latency trade execution.  Intuition is also working towards a p2p distributed network making exchange collocation a collaborative p2p activity.
Qt trade bot has years of development behind it already and is now maturing fast with commercial sponsorship.  It is mainly focused on trade execution and strategy creation.  In their last release they even released their own trade rule language which is awesome.
The idea behind the intution.io trade system is to provide a total trade environment.  Real time analysis and execution, back testing of strategies and execution of trades with distributed p2p features for teams.  
**Backtesting** is simply testing your strategy against the historical price data.  But it can get much more sophisticated than that which is why intuition.io is using R and Python programming languages which have rich mature libraries for this type of work they also can make use of C++, C, D, Fortran etc.. and JITing  to optimize for speed in critical calculations.
Since QT trader is also open source there is no reason you should not be able to make it part of your own inution.io platform... they can easily work together but I believe the professional end goal for intution.io is a web service for those that want professional dashboards but open source and a curated trade platform they can tweak themselves or run parts of on their own. 
Finally the plan for critical networking systems is being done in Golang which gives users with normal machinery the advantage of being able to run low latency network systems with a minimal volatile memory footprint in comparison to jvm based platforms.

The quality of conversation has taken a dive no doubt.
I think if people want to let this be an effective and quality forum of communication some simple rules should be followed (by those who want some change and breathing room for a discussion).
1.  Do not engage in a discussion with a sock puppet
2.  Only vote for users you can find a real identity for
Open for more ideas on this.

It might be tough to have a global Utopian meshnet.... I would not bet against the current ISP system as being very efficient.
In localized networks built on smaller commodity parts you might have congestion problems on popular nodes that lead to other important nodes and need proper routeing and rerouting.

You should use all of them.
The most popular point of failure in the bitcoin ecosystem is the exchanges.
I do not mean that the are not run well at all but you should hedge against the failures and hiccups of one exchange by using all of them.

Ok, my bad is not a marketing board its a PR board and as someone who has been involved constantly in bitcoin since 2012 you just sound like a robot to me programmed to respond to concerns but not able to yet synthesize the actual undertones of the conversation going on.

My point is the moderator patroll is giving canned responses to things not directly brought up in the dialogue of thread conversations....

He is pointing out the scale to which bitcoin is being used.  He used the Kuwait Frequent Flyer program to illustrate that as well as bringing up that just because a wallet was opened it does not mean the user kept it or keeps it for further transactions... considering users of bitcoin regard the ability to create a new address for every transaction... his observation should not be easily dismissed.
So by your standard anything that is used daily in commerce is a valuable currency... maybe so but tide and ciggarettes are used as a currency and you do not see people setting up established investment funds for them even though it is quite possible that they are used in more daily transactions than bitcoin.  


Either did you but I will offer up an observation for discussion.
Payment processor Bitpay has stopped doing transaction percentage price models and switched to subscription based models.... either they are truly being saintly or a flat fee generates more revenue than transactions...
I think you are choosing to only look at the upside rather than look at what exists and your view is bent on bitcoin being an investment rather then a usable technology and that is the view he is building a case against.  I share his view because investment hype alone does not add underlying value to Bitcoin.

My hopeful guess is the decrease is not in the quality of the news but rather the liquidity of actual use and transactions going up and fear of holding to hedge against state backed currency going down in the US.  The Eurozone is another story in terms of economics.  Regardless Bitcoin does not seem to be proliferating in popularity there in terms of use by normal people just vanguard developments.

The best place to go for this information is Regarding your questions:
Bitfinex ItBit are the best derivative exchanges
The chinese exchanges are tough to assess.  Many people point out that the volume seems unreal... in comparison to the US and Euro exchanges... And others will point out a small crowd in china is a global market anywhere outside the border.  To their credit the chinese exchanges from Bter on up seem dedicated to fixing errors as quickly as possible. The [top three Chinese]( exchanges are leading in terms of mature technologies by having FIX protocol apis.
Kraken is good in terms of an operational organization Bitstamp is where people go for liquidity outside the Chinese exchanges.
Keep an Eye on the following projects
   
 [Coinolith]( &amp; [Intution.io](
   
  
(the start of crypto integration is only two days old)
Intution is a collaborative p2p distributed trade platform in open pre alpha and Coinolith is the start of crypto trade integration.

So is telling people the price is going up or will be worth tens of thousands in a short amount of time....  Its really no different then telling people to wait for Jesus to save them....  for most of the fanboys its like telling them bitcoin is Jesus and if they bought at the top Jesus will save them..........
As someone who has been on for 2+ years there are lots of retarded things I have seen over time....  and I speak from concern that a critical mind set it not encouraged in and whats worrying is it lets operators like MTGox, BFL and others do business ripping people off.... but have no worries kid....  Bitcoin the Jesus will save us all.

Guys, Guys, Guys,
Elon Musk is downplaying bitcoin because you can't use the same block chain for quick transactions on Mars.  As soon as he gets to mars Bitcoin will look like ACH again.

The Bitcoin Foundation was an honorable vehicle to commercialize and normalize Bitcoin.  It appears as if there was no market valued ROI on foundation core activities.  What can be done?  Treat bitcoin for what it is, new technology that has a currency but not yet suited for mainstream use with the amount of hype and speculation going on.

A paper trading api for the exchange would be great.
Especially for those of us not allowed to use the real one.
