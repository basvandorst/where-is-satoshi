I've got a pretty good handle on Armory now but tbh bip38 is way beyond me.  I mean I could figure it out.  But if I'm not mistaken, bip38 is a way to encrypt your paper wallet, is that right?  So if someone still got ahold of your private key the only think bip38 is protecting is my paper wallet?  
Thanks for your reply

If I'm not mistaken, what you refer to as "wallets" here is actually referring to addresses within a wallet.  Each wallet has its own paper or digital backup and passphrase.

Excellent, thanks.  What would you consider a "quality offline signing technique"?
Basically I'm using a USB to transfer the signature from offline computer to online one.  I guess pretty standard Armory procedure.  Any better ways?
Thanks again

Sorry, are we talking about wallets or addresses?  Each wallet would have different private keys, wouldn't they?  Each address within a wallet would have the same private key but wouldn't each wallet have a different one?

Well thank you very much!

Thanks for your reply.  If somehow someone managed to get hold of the private keys wouldn't each address be vulnerable then?  I feel safer spreading out my coins among a few wallets.

Thanks, that makes sense.  I'm probably being over cautious : )
