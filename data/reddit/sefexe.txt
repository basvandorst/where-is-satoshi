Congrats on having any amount of coin and good luck! If I do it right, I should have one btc by the end of the year, if not sooner.

I was a no-coiner till about June or July. So I think I had some FOMO right around 10k. I didn't realize I had enough money stashed somewhere for 1btc till about a month ago. 
So I guess what I'm getting at is now and maybe a month or so from now is the second best time to buy up!
I think.

This is what I'm waiting on. But if I see it shoot to 9k, I'm pulling the trigger.

I just started like... a week ago and I put in about $100 or so. I feel like it's just a drop in the ocean. I want to keep putting more in, but money is a little tight atm. By the end of the year, I should be able to drop more in.
What got you started? Especially with looking at how high it is atm to buy.

I use pei and [cashed out]( 18 dollars in btc.
I don't shop at nearly enough places right now though, so I'm not getting as much cash back.

This is actually pretty good! Doesn't hurt that I like ERB and Epic Lloyd. Does a good job of presenting the differences and benefits of crypto.

I get paid Thursday morning(12-1am), so it always seems to work out pretty well with the dip. Just wish I could afford to buy more.

Oh well I have uh, even less drugs!

Where did you get yours from? Before I even started to get some coinage, I bought a physical (obviously fake) one from Wish, haha.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:28:32
I always get paid around midnight, so I wait till the morning juuuuuuust in case something like this happens lmao.
Of course it could go the other way too. ��‍♂️
