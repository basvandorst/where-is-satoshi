I don’t mind the bank analogy. It’s a familiar metaphor. It’s many of the upsides a bank offers without many of the downsides. Maybe the metaphor does more harm than good. I don’t know.

Actually that is simply not true. Read the LN spec

When your bitcoin is “stored” in a channel, it is not owned or controlled by the other party. Nothing can happen to your bitcoin in that channel without your explicit consent. And you can close that channel any time you want without the other party’s consent. As can they. You have a funding transaction and a commitment transaction. The commitment transaction is actually created and signed by both parties *before* the funding transaction is posted to the blockchain. The commitment transaction is held by both parties off chain and can be posted at any point. Outside of software bugs or key mismanagement there is no counterparty risk at all.

KYC and AML are specific to a jurisdiction. LN is borderless. If no fiat is involved, there’s no way to enforce AML/KYC

I was offering a refutation to the assertion that funds can be seized or loaned out in a LN channel. In the absence of any counter-refutation, I’ll presume success.

It’s a leap forward because unlike a bank, your funds cannot be seized. They cannot be loaned to anyone. They cannot be restricted to transacting with any other party, anywhere in the world. It’s actually a tremendous leap.

Unless it doesn’t. Like when I trade you 2000 satoshis for your goat. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:46:48
That is correct. With careful key/wallet management and well-vetted software the risk approaches zero.

You are not actually handing anything to any other party. Worth a re-read.

51% attack by a very well funded adversary.
