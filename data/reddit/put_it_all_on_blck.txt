I've never had visa, amx, or discover deny my valid requests for protection. And IF they did screw me, I can take them to small claims court.
Don't act like every financial company is out to fuck the consumer, when it's in their best interest to have a symbiotic relationship with you.
PayPal on the other hand is fucking terrible.

LMAO this guy thinks you can spend Bitcoin.

Wait till you find out Woz has a 'college' named after him:  (spoiler: hes selling his name to an existing diploma mill, who according to google, graduate and make 20k/yr afterwards)

Can't duplicate Bitcoin but you can copy it. There are over a hundred crypto-currencies these days.

I doubt it. I admit that I was wrong about the success of btc however it's been like 5 years already, since it blew up, and people were like 'oh Newegg takes it or oh this site takes it's and it was almost always a third party payment processor, not the actual company taking btc.
It has definitely grown in use, but for less mainstream uses, such as peer payments, or buying legal items that you don't want tied to you (like VPN's). We still have yet to see a true adoption from mainstream retailers

Honestly would still be a mutually beneficial situation. PayPal needs to stay relevant (see their venmo business), and Bitcoin still hasn't broken into the mainstream yet (PayPal has a record with businesses and consumers).

The company that millennials hate and don't realize their precious venmo is PayPal.

Which says something about the current lifespan of Bitcoin. What amount of USD do you think is the lowest you could manually find a transaction for in a day with no automation? My bet is 500K~
And before anyone downvote me into oblivion, I'm just saying Bitcoin is still in its infancy, not that it is a failure.

Someone should buy him some schezuan sauce, and have it cooked up by Gordan Ramsay.

Silly bitcoiners, this guy is simply leveraging. He probably invested in bitcoin. If it gets to 10k hes going to be rich and will just have a new one cloned in a lab, and if it doesnt get to 10k he doesnt have to eat his own testicle. L E V E R A G I N G

What concerns me, is that people arent actually spending bitcoin like normal currency. Most of the major websites that do accept it, are only accepting it because theres a third party payment processor that is taking the risk and ending up with the bitcoin, the sites just want USD/local currency. Most transactions that are happening are creation, and trading, and then despite what everyone wants to admit, the actual transactions where bitcoin is being used for payment, are usually shady ones.
The growing valuation can be whatever, but if theres nobody truly accepting it, theres no foundation, and I have a problem with that, and it seems like the actual adoption rate of retailers and non-bitcoin related companies has stalled.

This is such a mixed conversation.
 The government certainly overreaches at times, and a lot of government services are run HORRIBLY (go to the DMV anytime anywhere).
But its a questionable decision to essentially close up shop and rely on corporations for what should be the future of humanity. While spaceX and others have symbiotic relationships with the US government, what happens when that changes? When the corporations go to another country, or simply hold space exploration as a hostage?

Unfortunately he treats his employees like he treats himself. You work and work and work, get a quick rest/reward and it's back to work.
This isn't uncommon with disruptive companies (see Amazon), but it's not like Elon is a saint making miracles happen. Turn over rate at the Fremont Tesla factory is high due to the work environment

Too much logic for a cryto trader.

Also Buffett doesn't mess with speculative investments, so crypto is something he'd never recommend. 
Clearly people make money on speculations AND safe investments, so it's not like he could be wrong or right.

Greed. Either through extortion or influencing Bitcoin.

They dont accept Credit or Debit cards because of the fees. However those fees go to paying for benefits, quite a few of them are actually really good.

Yeah, he wants people to have his work ethic, which I get, but that's not the work environment most people are looking for or want.

Until the next big thing comes around. My bet is it's potatoes, everybody loves potatoes and therefore it is the most valuable currency.
