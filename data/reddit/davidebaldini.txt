Just use Core. Classic is a misnomer to trap new users into using a different thing.

1) It's more likely that air will become payed, rather than electricity become free;
2) Fusion has already been discovered;
3) Synthesis of gold is an hypothesis.

My impression is that bing searches word-for-word, without care for phrases or built-up concepts made from conjoined words. Google does that for what I see.

Thanks, I'm checking if the are content with an EU ID or if they want a full blown passport.

Sure they accept visa? They have the strictest user verification possible though, which I conflict with personal dignity.

Actually they don't want Italian customers.

Obviously, people should be protected from having access to controversial information.

Oh yes, I was talking more broadly about what happens in r:btc in general. If a post is fake, I expect truth to naturally emerge thru the comments, and the troll to be exposed and downvoted. That's in fact what happened in this specific case.
This is to say, discretion is advised when reading any news, but I find it a bit too invasive that muderators in r:bitcoin have to hold my hand and aprove what I'm allowed to see, and what instead I can't even be aware of.
I think people should be allowed to discuss openly their opinions, and when a FUD post inevitably appears, it should be the people to point it out and clarify what is wrong and why, and if, that is FUD.
Just my opinion.

Is it possible you made multiple transactions to or between the same addresses without generating new ones?

That's a "decorative" disagreement, not the kind of disagreement we're talking about.

Proxying the node wouldn't circumvent the ban?

Does that mean I have someone's grades in my 75GB-and-counting blockchain?

You won't confirm that.
The guy behind the Silk Road was identified by FBI right because he was overconfident with his apparently bullet-proof tor setup. FBI discovered that not the entirety of the Silk Road web traffic was tunneled thru tor, and from that they got his IP address.

That's science, so it will!

I think when a foreigner lands in an American airport, police inspect their computer for forbidden data, like PDFs of the Inspire magazine; is that correct?
The same way, private keys could be searched for.

I don't get this part. Aren't you required to deposit your coins on a hub's own address in order to open an LN channel? At that point you no longer control the private key of your coins and you basically relay on good faith of the LN hub. is that correct?
