Overall, yes, I'm ahead, but I still look at those I bought at the top as losing money right now.
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:12:56
I'd love to get to 21, more than halfway there now, but I've started hedging in a few other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:26:31
I bought when the price was ~1253 (I bought when it was near the top on OkCoin)so I still have a ways to go to break even.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:19:27
As someone living in China who trades on OKCoin.cn, all I can say is thank god I moved everything into my Electrum wallet ages ago.
Thanks to the advice on this sub, I learned one absolute truth of Bitcoin: Only keep coins on exchanges as long as you need to, then GTFO. I buy and transfer off almost instantly. I used to think about day trading, but the risk just isn't worth it and, when stuff like this happens, only serves to reinforce that notion.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:00
I'm watching OkCoin.cn. It went down, but seems to be on the way back some right now.
P.S. I'm in China, 5:45 in the morning here.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:15:29
Then buy back in right now. It's not much higher than the lowest point it hit, and I doubt you sold at that point.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:31:34
China not allowing withdrawals is a good thing, in my opinion. I really don't trust the Chinese being in the Bitcoin market. They are well-known manipulators and cheaters, so anything to reduce their influence is a win.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:45:37
No, I was going to sell while it was still above $1000, and I actually put in an order to sell at $1050, but then I saw the price was bouncing around, so I quickly cancelled the order before it was filled. I thought it would drop even more, so selling above $1000 would still allow me to re-invest if it dropped to $800 and increase my coin holdings.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:40:11
I use OKcoin in China, it worked great for me. But now you can't withdraw from it until the government finishes their "checks". But I can confirm OkCoin works great in normal times.
Supposedly, [Huobi works now]( but I don't use it so I can't confirm.
So if you need it right now, today, Huobi might be the way to go. Otherwise, I'd wait a few more days and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:54:33
Right, and I could sell for $1200+ on the exchanges right now.

Honestly, since most exchanges in China still can't withdraw fiat, there probably isn't much the Chinese are going to do. The Chinese government may have kept the locks on in anticipation of this decision since the Chinese in the past proved to be emotional, manipulative amateurs who have no right to be dabbling in something they don't understand.

But which direction?
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:23:59

As do I, but it's 12 AM here.
So what was your point again?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:59:05
I think Kraken can do it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:54:08
I mean, if you sell at $1100 and it dips to $800 then re-invest all that money you just made back into it, you could increase your coin HODLings by about 37%. So for example if you sell 10 at $1100 and re-buy at $800, you just increased your 10 coins to 13.75 coins. Of course if it dips even more, you get even more coins, but that depends on how much you think the decision will affect the price.
Again, I'm not sure it's worth the risk, but I'm thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:13:17
I basically don't trade in China anymore. I use Kraken and Uphold now.

@_date: 2017-03-10 17:44:40
When you consider how much potential readers know about Bitcoin other than "Oh, aye, think I've heard that mentioned 'round.", I don't see why a Bitcoin story would be of much interest.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:08:19
I believe in Bitcoin and believe it will hit at least $2000 by year end, regardless of what happens over these next few days, so if you HODL, you'll still probably end up making money.
What I'm suggesting is just a way to increase your coin HODLings before it takes off again. SOMETHING is probably going to happen with the price in the next few days. We just don't know how big of a change there is going to be, which is why I said it's a big risk to try this.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:20:38
So you sold at 980?
Look, it's about $100 higher than that right now. If you believe Bitcoin will be worth $2000, $5000, or $10000 one day, are you really going to haggle over 100 bucks?
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:04:44
Probably not. Why would there be?
If there was panic selling followed by panic buying, then wouldn't that mean.....
We're right back where we started?
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:32:57
Potentially possibly maybe could be.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:01:23
Yes, and what caused that sudden sentiment?
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:35:39
I don't know if you noticed, but things were just a *little* busy today in the Bitcoinverse. When there's a lot of traffic, transferring coins takes longer, no matter the fee.
If you plan to trade and not just hold, keep some coins on the exchange you use. Or keep them all if that's what you want. For holders, speed of wallet is of little concern.
I use Electrum, it seems to be a pretty good wallet, simple to use, low resources, good security, although disclaimer, I haven't used anything else.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:40:58
Yes, it really did go that high.
Take it from someone who trades in China as well as the US. At one point, the value of Bitcoin on the Chinese market was $120 more than in the US market.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:12:19
In reading most of those comments, the problems seem to come from verifying accounts. I admit it took them an inordinately long time to verify my account, and in the meantime I had several thousand dollars tied up with them, but they did finally verify me today and I've already moved my money out. I think they key was I stayed patient and courteous when dealing with them and very calmly explained/provided information they requested.
I do think they are a little TOO careful, but when it comes to money, security is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:14:14
That's exactly what I'm trying to do, move them to a wallet then move them off the exchange.
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:28:55
Kraken is fantastic as well. As long as Coinbase keeps treating their customers like shit, they don't deserve our business.

The only thing I think is suspcious is that on Okcoin.cn, it topped out at EXACTLY 8888RMB, which, if you know anything about Chinese culture, you know has meaning as a lucky number. Then it fell to EXACTLY 6000RMB before climbing again. 
Those numbers are too precise to just be a coincidence, I think. It's almost like someone wanted to send a message.

I also haven't found a place where it lists the BTC/USD exchange rate. Is it on there somewhere?
EDIT: What? You can only move $500 A DAY on Uphold? That's not going to cut it.
The search continues...
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:05:25
It was tough knowing I bought at 7500RMB and 8500RMB to see it fall all the way to 6000RMB, but after I got over the shock I thought "Hey! Great chance to buy some more!" So that's what I did.
Now hodl. Trust your BTC.

That's interesting because I have a support request with Kraken that I submitted 3 days ago...

Well, it blasted over 6700, so much for that conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:52:50
Yes I do. I considered taking advantage of the market to make some profit, but decided I valued holding my coins more.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:34:20
That's true, I may have to look into it next time there's a huge value gap. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:05:45
For those of us who plan to hold, this is just a blip on the radar.
My only regret is I bought when it was above $1000 because I bought into the hype that "We'll never see $1000 again." In the long run the value of Bitcoin is still going to rise, I just wish I could buy more when it's below $1000 like now.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:41:15
It is rather suspicious that it topped out at EXACTLY 8888RMB, which is considered a lucky number in China, and bottomed out at EXACTLY 6000RMB.

People saying "If you do not own your keys, you don't own your Bitcoin", can you eleborate? I have moved half of my coins onto my computer in Electrum. I clicked on "Export Private keys" and got a long string which I saved as a .csv file. What does this string do? How can I use it?
I have the seed to my wallet written down on a piece of paper, I know my password, but I'm not sure what knowing the key does or what I can use it for. 
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:12:16


That is pretty much what we are discussing here. All exchanges allow you to buy coins and move coins. Something like Coinbase's vault doesn't really come into play for us, because we all have our own personal wallets (right? RIGHT???), so essentially, the only real differentiating factors are the speed and the fees involved.
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:13:52
Sorry, nothing to be done. All those coins are lost to you.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:27:52
I'd wait. The way this is going, there may be an even better opportunity to buy in a few days.
First in this sub it was "Buy when it's 1000 before it really takes off!" (I did that)
Then it was "Last chance to buy under 1000!" (I also did that)
Now it's "Buy the dip!" (I also did that)
So right now, I have a huge chunk of money invested in BitCoin at around the $1000 level, another decent chunk around $900, and a smaller chunk around $800. And collectively, I've lost several thousand dollars in value. 
I still believe in Bitcoin, but I really wish I could have invested more money at the lower prices. The way it is now, I don't have a whole lot more I'd feel comfortable investing, all because I believed the "Past $1000, to the moon!" hype.
Don't believe the hype on this forum, guys.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:25:57
Salty much?
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:54:08
That's not what I'm seeing here:
Still looks like about a $20-$30 gap, which again, is pretty normal.
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:31:45


@_date: 2017-01-06 05:44:22
Because the Chinese, if possible, want to move coins INTO America, not out of. Remember, they are running the show here, so most Bitcoin flows reflect what the Chinese are doing. The problem is the price of Bitcoin is so much higher in China so they are losing money by doing this, and as I explained, it's higher in China because there is a higher demand than anywhere else in the world. It's simple economics. Like I explained, Bitcoin is not just its monetary value, but it's also how valuable it is as a tool to accomplish a certain end. 
This is what has led to the overheated speculation market in China. The Chinese don't trust their own currency, and they have little opportunity to invest in anything but real estate. That's how they ruined their stock market 2 summers ago. But I doubt that will happen to Bitcoin because, even though right now Bitcoin is a Chinese playground, it is truly an international commodity.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:24:01
Thanks, I figured it summed it up better than I could.
And yes, hot money brokers do work for the average person. I'm not going to implicate anyone or tell you the details, but just trust me when I say they do.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:53:33
I want to, but I'm running out of money I'd feel safe investing. Remember, "don't invest more than you are comfortable losing". I'm about at that level right now, all because I invested nearly 60% of that when it was above $1000.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:15:46
I know, and I do expect the upward trend. It's only that I could have gotten more coins and a better investment if I'd ignored the hype when it broke $1000 and everyone saying $1000 is the new floor.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:14:33
Ok, I will do that, but what does the key do? Why do I need it? Like I said, I wrote down the seed to my wallet, I know my password, why do I need the key too?
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:30:15
First of all, bitcoin is pretty much totally and completely useless for getting money out of China. There are about a dozen different ways of getting money out of China that work a lot better than bitcoin, and no one uses bitcoin to get around currency controls.  The best rate we could get is 5% transaction fee, and it turns out that you can do things at 0.1% with using the hot money brokers.
Having said that, it's the policy of the Chinese government to gradually get rid of currency controls and to liberalize the economy so that more things are done by the market.  One way they do this is to wink at people and tell them that if they do illegal thing X, they won't end up in jail, and see what happens.  If the world doesn't blow, up they make it legal.  If bad things start happening, the cough very loudly and tell people that they will start putting people in jail, and people take the hint and stop.
One funny thing is that most Chinese bitcoin exchanges has a government official that sits in the office and does nothing but read newspapers.  He's just there to monitor things for the Chinese government.
There are amazing and incredible things happening with interest finance in China, and bitcoin is just a tip of a very, very big iceberg.  The government is encouraging and supporting this sort of thing since it wants to modernize China's financial system, and it knows that the state can't do it, so it's really supporting private entrepreneurs to fix the system.
Chinese officials aren't dumb, they know that if they ban Bitcoin they won't be able to regulate it and it would make matters worse. Banning it would mean telling everyone in China it posed a threat. People would jump on to that and exploit it more.
If they allow individuals to hold it though, it presents a great opportunity to exert financial influence on a global scale. They already have huge mining operations and manufacture miners. If they can get close to 51% they could potentially have great control over the cryptocurrency.
China still wants a stake in OPEC countries and Bitcoin has the potential to overtake these countries weak currencies which are rich in resources and under banked. Venezuela and some African countries are currently experiencing hyperinflation. People are flocking to Bitcoin to make sure they have a good store of value.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:58:16
Full disclosure: I'm actually in China and I trade on the Bitcoin exchanges there as well as on Coinbase in America. These last few days were nuts, with the value of Bitcoin in China being a full $100 more than the value in America, it was a good time to buy in America, then sell in China. I didn't do that much because I believe in long term holding, but now the markets are very nearly the same in price again.
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:46:04
I'm not sure "mad" is the word. Annoyed is more like it. I understand that Coinbase is providing me a service by storing the coins in a vault on my behalf, but it really shouldn't take 2 days to have access to them. If I move them from my offline wallet onto an exchange, it takes an hour, tops.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:48:00

@_date: 2017-01-06 06:16:37
I really hate how slow things are on the American side of Bitcoin. In China, if you want to add funds to your account from your bank, it takes 30 minutes or less, same thing if you want to withdraw. I don't get this whole "Wait a few days" thing. With something like Bitcoin, a few days can be an eternity.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:49:38
They don't respond on weekends and holidays, but in my experience they would usually get back to me in about 48 hours.
Now, Kraken.com, on the other hand..... And don't even talk about Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:58:36
Wait, what are you using instead of Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:21:21
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:14:40
So would knowing the seed be enough? I don't actually need to know the key as well, do I, since the seed gives access to the keys?
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:33:03
There are a lot of things going on.
First of all, you must understand that the majority of people in the world on the Bitcoin market are Chinese. They control something like 70% (or possibly more) of the market, so as they go, so goes Bitcoin. 
Second, most of the major Bitcoin mining operations are also located in China. What bearing this has on the difference in price is up to speculation, but it's worth noting.
3rd, the dollar has long been the preminent currency of the world, a safe haven for all other currencies to flock to, especially the Chinese, many who have gotten their wealth through corrupt means and want to hide it from the government. Therefore, something like Bitcoin is necessarily more valuable to them than it is to an American simply because it's not just a bet on the future, but it's also a very real way for them to hide and move their wealth around. China imposes a very strict quota on how much RMB can leave the country per person (I think $50k), so something like Bitcoin is a way for the wealthy Chinese to move their money around without actually breaking the quota.
4th, the Chinese economy is slowing down, and most people in China know it. They are trying to "lock in" the value of their money now by investing in other opportunities for growth while the RMB continues to slide.
These are some reasons why Bitcoin is a hot commodity in China, and why they would be willing to pay more for it than an American or others. Bitcoin, like other currencies/commodities, is not just a monetary value, but also reflects the reality of geopolitical forces.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:23:15
Quite the opposite, the yuan increased in value, which is bad for Bitcoin. If the yuan weakens again (which it almost certainly will), expect Bitcoin to rise as Chinese flock to it to retain value.
Additionally, some speculate that some rich guy(s) bought a lot of Bitcoin which helped drive the rally and sold them all at 8888 RMB (a lucky number in China) just to be a jackass. This big selloff causing others to panic and sending the market tumbling. There is no proof for this other than the suspicious coincidence that the number 8888 has special meaning to the Chinese.
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:10:37
I can vouch for Kraken. 
I also have an account on Uphold, but I'm a little worried because of reviews I've read here... So far, no problem, but I'm just now entering "Phase II" of identity verification, which is where a lot of people seemed to have trouble before. We'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:20:31
Still going down, but I'm keeping the faith and holding. Still think 2000 is possible this year.
For those who don't know, the Chinese Yuan gained value suddenly a few hours ago. It was trading at about 6.96~1USD, but now it's at 6.88~1USD. Since China is the main driver of Bitcoin price, people took their money out of Bitcoin there and put it back in the RMB. It's still falling rapidly there and is at about 6200 as I type this after topping out at around 8900 a few hours ago.
Personally, I don't believe this gain in RMB will last, and once it goes down again, Bitcoin will go up again. I just wish I hadn't bought when it was above 7500, but that's the way it goes sometimes.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:17:16
Don't monitor just that. There are a lot of geopolitical forces in play that affect the prices of all world currencies. The best bet is to watch the monetary policies of the major economies of the world, but with China it can be difficult because they will often give little warning before acting.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:40:08
I thought about that too. It was too perfect that it stopped on 8888. I thought maybe there was some guy (or a group) who had thousands Bitcoins, and as soon as it hit that symbolic number, they sold everything. 
Probably they are already insanely rich so it's just a game to them, or they work for the Chinese government (which would also mean they are insanely rich).
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:01:50
I saw that, didn't know much about it so I checked it out online.
Interesting. I've also been frustrated with Coinbase, was considering going into OKcoin.com since I already trade on OKcoin in China, but I'm still a little leery of giving a Chinese company too much information about me.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:54:48
Ok, so what you're saying is knowing the seed is enough, since it gives you access to the keys? I did write it down on a piece of paper, so I like to think I'm good there. I'm considering converting my Electrum wallet to "cold storage" to take it offline unless I specifically want to move coins around, so I think that should be enough to protect me with 99% certainty, right?
EDIT: Ok, I did make a new wallet and wrote down the new seed as well. I'm going to transfer my coins, destroy the old wallet, then take the new wallet offline. Should I be ok?

Yes, that was one thing stopping me too. But what I could do is wait until the price of Bitcoin was about even in both countries then move it back to America and cash out.
But the main reason I didn't is because I'm not in this for the short game. I want to hold long, and I wasn't about to sell my bitcoins just to make a short-term gain if later the price kept going up in both places, meaning even with my profits I'd still be able to buy fewer actual coins.

I was trading on OKCoin. You can bet I was moving my BTC onto and off the exchange as quickly as I could... Never left my BTC hanging around for more than a few hours at the most.
I did ok, made about .5 BTC in profit from where I started, before the big crash. Now I'm waiting for it to come back, but either way I'm firmly in HODL mode now, with some cost averaging here and there.
I'm glad China has been put in the corner, now I hope for a slow, steady rise in BTC value for the rest of the year.

Ok, thanks for your opinion.

People saying "If you do not own your keys, you don't own your Bitcoin", can you eleborate? I have moved half of my coins onto my computer in Electrum. I clicked on "Export Private keys" and got a long string which I saved as a .csv file. What does this string do? How can I use it?
I have the seed to my wallet written down on a piece of paper, I know my password, but I'm not sure what knowing the key does or what I can use it for.
Thanks for the help!

Yes, forget Coinbase. Move to Gemini or Uphold. I closed my Coinbase account yesterday.

'But not as low as before, so the general trend is up'
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:49:09
Higher as in $2k? $5k? $10k?  I don't really believe anything higher than that is possible this year.
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:53:41
Yep, since you typed that, I already downloaded Electrum, and transferred some test mBTC to it. I don't really plan to spend my bits, and I did try destroying it and resotring using the seed, so I guess I'm ok there?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:18:56
Ok, I kind of understand. In what kind of context would I use the key? That's what I'm not clear of. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:34:51
I bought 1 BTC during the dip. :)

If you're on Windows 10, use the Bitcoin Price Live Tile from the store, the price shows right there on the tile.

Does no one here use OKcoin.com? I'm curious to know what that is like.
And yes, I can't stand Coinbase and their wait times. 48 hours to move your Bitcoins out of a vault to you wallet, WTF is that bs? As soon as my coins can be moved (5 more hours), I'm sending them to my offline wallet and closing my Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:57:07
Well, seeing as how China has all the big mining operations and a majority of the market share, if they quit Bitcoin, the market would crash and wouldn't recover, if at all, since non-China investors might be scared off for good after such a crash, I'd say Bitcoin needs China more than China needs Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:32:56
I use it to buy Bitcoin and immediately transfer it to my offline wallet. So far, no problems, and they seem to offer a lower rate than most other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:43:09
Nothing about selling, it's that I invested in several whol coins at the $1100 level. If I had waited, I could have nearly doubled my BTC holdings today. I don't have a lot more money to invest.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:28:27
There were a lot of people in this sub who said that, or to buy in when it was above 1000 before it really took off, saying we'd all remember the days when $1000 was considered cheap. (To be fair, that last point may be true yet.)
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:15:41
Make sure you sell at 18,887 then use the profit to buy more coins when it drops back to where it is now.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:13:31
I have heard something between 2x - 7x is reasonable for this year. If it really hits 7x, it will be very tempting to cash out, but the promise of hitting even greater highs next year should help keep the faith. I've heard some people claim that Bitcoin could be worth 100k at some point in the next 5 years, but I'm not sure I believe that.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:01:59
I doubt it. I think it will hold where it is now before slowly trending upward again. The fact remains the global economy is still relatively weak and Bitcoin looks like a safe haven to many.

"Posting" does not equate to "reading".
[Here's a comment]( from just a few hours ago implying after it crosses $1000 again, there's no looking back:
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:22:12
Yes, I already did this. I will not generate keys from the new wallet, and already wrote down the seed of the new wallet. As soon as the transfer is confirmed in 30 minutes or so, I'll completely destroy the old wallet and convert the new wallet to cold storage. 
I think I should be ok then, right?
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:06:09
Yes, but why so suddenly? Why the spike and not a gradual increase over a few weeks? Usually when something like this happens, there's a geo-political event tied to it.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:42:09
Something to keep in mind around this time of the year is Chinese New Year is coming up in a few weeks, the government likes to make the RMB slightly more valuable around this time of year so their citizens have more money to spend during their biggest holiday.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:52:09


I.... Didn't even know that was a thing. Why not just leave the codes in sealed envelopes with an attorney who will also act as the executor of your will?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:16:31
I also have coins in the Coinbase vault, but I'm moving them to the Coinbase wallet so I can send them to Electrum on my computer. (48 hour wait, argh!)
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:59:29
If you are in the US, Coinbase is a popular exchange to buy Bitcoin from. Buy your coin, select "Withdraw BTC", enter your wallet's receiving address, then sit back a few minutes and wait for your coins to arrive.
It's all pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:34:25
So they don't think Bitcoin will succeed. So what? As long as you can use it to buy/trade Bitcoin, who cares what the parent company thinks about it?
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:18:53
That's what I'm doing. I just hate not maximizing an opportunity (i.e., not buying when it was so high and buying more when it dropped), but that's the nature of the game, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:30:40
It is, but the RMB hasn't gained value this quickly in a very long time. The general trend for all of last year was the RMB weakening against the dollar, which is what led to huge capital outflows from China and the Chinese looking for safe havens for their cash.
Now that the RMB has gained some value, people suddenly think "Hey, maybe things aren't so bad after all!". It's only temporary though. The Chinese economy is slowing, and this will be reflected in their currency.
Already at 6700RMB~BTC as I type, so might be on the way back up already.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:52:25
I did. I'm not trying to get rich from BitCoin. I'd love to use it as my primary "bank", get a BitCoin debit card, all that. But if I can buy a nice TV with 1 coin today, and the very next day I can only afford a smartphone with that very same coin, I'm not sure how it's viable to make purchases. You'd have to check the charts every morning before heading out to see how much your money is worth that day, and even then your purchasing power can vary by the hundreds of dollars over the course of the day.
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:45:44
Nope, it was very weird to watch it happening. All through the day yesterday you could see the RMB pulling away from the USD. I wish I had taken a screencap at that time, but since the correction, the markets are back to being within $20 of each other, which is more in the normal range.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:48:22
Not really. The prices thend to fluctuate a lot depending on geopolitcal forces and currency valuations. From what I've seen, they seem to settle into a gap of about $20, although yesterday during the madness the value of Bitcoin in China was a full $120 more than Bitcoin in the US.
This will all balance out years from now, but as Bitcoin is still a maturing commodity, it's not quite uniform across markets because small changes can still cause large fluctuations, often independent of each other, although large enough shifts can affect all exchanges. This is why many still consider it to be a risky investment.

All the best to you. I hope you find enjoyment in life again. There really is so much wonder out there.

Why don't you just buy your own on an exchange?

It's been said, but I can confirm: Get an external USB HD exnclosure for like 10 bucks. You can access your drives then the same as you would access a flash drive. Password doesn't matter, it only matters if you were booting to the drive (which you aren't).

Why do you believe a drop is coming?
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:03:50
Interesting. On OkCoin.cn, it reached a peak of 6666 exactly before retreating a bit.
Recall that before the mini-crash earlier this month, it peaked on OkCoin.cn at exactly 8888. 
I won't say "suspicious".... But definitely interesting. There is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese were manipulating the market to peak at 8888 since that number has special meaning to them, but not sure about this one. Might be a coincidence, and it most likely (hopefully) will blow past this number before too long.
