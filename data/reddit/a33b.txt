Hmmm - seems google searches sometimes find outdated information.  who knew!
Thank you my friend - I agree - seems BATS is fine for canadians after all.

is the new addresses per day accurate?  if i'm reading it right, over 100 a day starting day 1 in 2009?  that seems - excessive.  perhaps 1 a day at first, no?

ha, right, that's funny, but not really...  i wonder if any unscrupulous Tim's employee has realized that all they have to do is take a picture of anyone's Tim's card, then buy themselves free stuff in perpetuity.  
the danger is in how you load a tim card - you link it to your credit card and tell it to automatically top up when it's balance is below a certain threshold.  
again, this isn't the end of the world - people don't go through that much money on a coffee card, so the consequences are limited.  and this doesn't have much to do with bitcoin either.  i'm just pointing out that i had taken for granted that gift card purchases were somewhat secure.  turns out they're perhaps the most hackable and least secure methods out there.

plugging directly into you laptop, follow by plugging into the wall, is not the typical way you'd configure any network device, S3 included.
i get why you did it - the S3 defaults to a static ip in the 192.168.1.x range.  your home network must be on a different range, so your laptop can't communicate with it if you just plug both into the switch.
You want to configure the tcp/ip settings of the S3 to work correctly on your network.  Typically, that means setting it to get an IP via DHCP, or, if you're a little more technically inclined, assigning it a valid static IP address.

That's not the price - that's the "transfer fee".  The real price is the transfer fee plus the unfavorable exchange rate.  Of course, the exchange rate is deftly hidden.
* WESTERN UNION ALSO MAKES MONEY FROM CURRENCY EXCHANGE. WHEN CHOOSING A MONEY TRANSMITTER, CAREFULLY COMPARE BOTH TRANSFER FEES AND EXCHANGE RATES.

Let me ask it another way - what is the least amount of time from today to public trading on the nasdaq?  i mean, if the next stage is approval, then can it just start trading the next morning, or is there a mandatory period of time between announcement of approval and actual trading?
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:26:36
sure, to the moon.  but i'm hoping to hear from someone with past experience watching a new ETF progress from application, approval, IPO and open trading.  really like to understand the typical timing between stages, and what notices will be publicized from stage to stage.

I really can't get my head around posts like this.  And there are lots of them - saying that we need a bitcoin ETF to make it possible to invest with IRA money.  Maybe it's a home-country bias?  Or a law that I'm not aware of?  As a Canadian, it's completely normal to invest outside of Canada, and these two now-rejected ETF's would have been ideal.  GBTC is not eligible for Canadian tax-deferred investments, but Bitcoin Tracker Euro is.  Is investing in an instrument that trades on the Stockholm exchange not eligible as a pretax investment in the US?  Or is it just unusual?  I mean, underneath, it's just bitcoins....

Principal Issues:	Is the BATS a designated stock exchange and is an ETF traded on BATS a qualified investment for the purposes of an RRSP or TFSA?
Position:	No.
Reasons:	BATS is not listed on the Department of Finance's list of Designated Stock Exchanges
April 4, 2014
Dear XXXXXXXXXX:
The office of the former Minister of Finance, the Honourable James M. Flaherty, sent me a copy of your correspondence about securities listed on a stock exchange and their eligibility to be held in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) or a tax-free savings account (TFSA) under the Income Tax Act. I apologize for the delay in replying.
Specifically, you are asking if an exchange traded fund (ETF) listed on the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) is a qualified investment for an RRSP or a TFSA under the legislation for these types of registered plans.
RRSPs and TFSAs must limit their investments to qualified investments. The Act provides the investment categories that are acceptable as qualified investments. In general, securities (other than futures contracts or other derivative instruments for which the holder's risk of loss may exceed the holder's cost) that are listed on a designated stock exchange are qualified investments for RRSPs and TFSAs. The BATS is not included on the list of designated stock exchanges.
Designated stock exchanges are designated as such by the Minister of Finance and are listed on the Department of Finance Canada website at  Officials of the Canada Revenue Agency consider the designation of a stock exchange to be a question of fact rather than a matter of interpretation of the legislation.
You can find the purpose of designating a stock exchange in a 2008 archived newsletter available on the Finance Canada website at 
I trust the information I have provided is helpful.
Yours sincerely,
Kerry-Lynne D. Findlay, P.C., Q.C., M.P.
Minister of National Revenue
Keely Storr

TD Canada Trust, but they had to manually add it to my profile and I can only execute trades over the phone.  I believe I was the first Canadian to purchase it through TD, according to the guy at the trading desk.

Bitcoin Tracker One has existed for years and is fully RRSP and TFSA eligible.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:22:26
doesn't exist, and probably never will.  buy, hold, retire.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:25:12
you can't.  nothing on the OTC market is eligible for TFSA or RRSP.
Buy "Bitcoin Tracker One" instead.  It's traded on the Stockholm exchange.  it is eligible.  I know so... ;)
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:22:08
beautiful.  can you post a pdf of this - love to frame it.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:23:22
I can almost hear the conference call...  "Everyone wants bitcoin.  how can we capitalize on that".
"We can have the Art Dept mock up some posters that make it sound like we'll help clients invest in bitcoin."
"Great, I didn't know we could help clients invest in bitcoin."
"Oh no, we 100% can't.  we'll just say BITCOIN in the ads, but then steer clients to our mutual funds."

what kind of outlet supplies power to these power distributors - your 240v 50a stove outlet? and how the hell do you have TWO of them in your apartment?

Anyone have experience watching a security that's been announced, but not yet open for trading on otcmarkets.com?  Because the real question isn't when will it start trading - the real question is how much time will there be between announcing it's initial day of trading, and that day coming.  In other words, how much warning will there be for people to prepare to begin trading it?  Please tell me i don't have to keep checking it everyday for a month+, just in case....
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:57:30
but not eligible for tax-deferred RRSP or TFSA accounts in canada.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:10:20
ok.  so on monday morning at 5am or whenever, when otcmarkets.com opens, how about you by $5 worth of anything listed.  anything.  let us know what your self-directed TFSA brokerage website says.
hint - it'll say "you're trying to buy something that's ineligible for a TSFA or RRSP.  kindly fuck off."
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:48:53
No, i don't think you can.  to qualify as a tax-deferred investment in canada, it has to be listed on one of exchanges approved for such use by CRA.  
OTCMarkets.com is not such a market.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:15:19
So, Sk33tshot, do you have anything to report?
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:44:31
It means that Canadians can not purchase within their RRSP or TFSA (similar to IRA or 401k).  So, like, 5 guys can't participate.
