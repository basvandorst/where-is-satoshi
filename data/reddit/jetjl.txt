I want to know what phone you have that could possibly survive the pressures of 40m under the sea. (My phone only does 4m)

I put like .5 bitcoins into a letter I'll be getting in 5 years and into a letter I put into my class time capsule back when bitcoins were like $35!

The Printrbot Jr. is amazing, and was the cheapest when I bought it, now being replaced by the printrbot  simple as the cheapest printer from printrbot. I know of thingiverse but I rather make something up in 123D design.

There is also the Bitcurex cards you can get, I ordered one off of bitmit but I'm not very sure how to use it...

I suggest not using the qt client, like electum that allows you to remember a neumonic to retrieve your wallet later or at the very least have the wallet.DAT file saved in a safe place. Good luck in retrieving your wallet.

I haven't decided yet what to print out yet. Though I'm using a Printrbot Jr. to print it out. I'll be using biodegradable PLA Plastic, I wonder how long it would last in a time capsule.

Sadly I've sealed it already with a stamp on it... though its highly unlikely that in 3 years micro sd cards go the way of the floppy.
