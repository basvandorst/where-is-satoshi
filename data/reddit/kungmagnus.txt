The employees are not banned from owning Bitcoin. They're banned from buying bitcoin meaning that employees who already own bitcoin can keep it. Also it is not clear if the ban is only for bitcoin, a lot of local news outlets are reporting "bitcoin and other crypto currencies"
  The internal memo is not leaked so we dont have much info to go by except that their CEO said he was concerned that "his employees would end up in a situation that is unethical or even criminal because of the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency markets".
  If I were a betting man I'd bet that they withdraw this ban when they realize it might be in violation of local labor laws. Even if it is not in violation of the law I would assume they'd want to avoid unnecessary costly litigation or conflict with the unions at all costs. Unions in Scandinavia are incredibly powerful.

Agreed. These graphs are beyond useless. It's even more useless than the technical analysis graphs that gets posted here sometimes. It's basically like saying:
 "Hey the bitcoin price increased 1100% last year, that's on average +1% per day. Let's make 10k simulations where we assume that bit coin will average +1% per day for next year too but randomize it between -1% and 3% daily and call it a prediction for next year"
*(Actual math above is wrong but u get the point)*

Im obviously not saying it's impossible to buy stuff with Bitcoin. I'm just saying that virtually no one is doing that at the moment, people are instead buying it as a speculative asset. 
In other words I think you would probably be better off making your planned purchase in fiat. It's very likely to be faster and cheaper :P. 
The intent of Bitcoin as laid out in the whitepaper was to introduce "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust" (that is without relying on a trusted central authority). That is not what's driving the market today unfortunately.

It's not happenning at all, not yet at least. In fact we're going the wrong way. In the early days of bitcoin a lot of the daily transaction volume was used to buy things on the darknet. This is not true any more.
   Almost no one uses bitcoin to buy things any more(other than other currencies for speculative reasons) . There is very little reason for a business and/or states to accept bitcoin as payment at the moment because of the high transaction costs and slow transaction speeds(not to mention the current volatility). This is why some big businesses no longer offer bitcoin as payment options even though they tried it(Steam,Microsoft)
 As long as these problems persist bitcoin will not be useful as a currency.

Seems like the shorting opportunity of the century if they go public at the proposed price.

I dunno I feel like you're widening the definition of the word "censorship" so it loses all value. Following your logic me telling you to shut up would be censorship because I'm attempting to "silence other people".

True, timing is EVERYTHING when shorting. And you need to be "right" very quickly or it's gonna cost u.

I believe you misinterpreted what he said, which is understandable since he was not very clear in this quick 5 minute interview. 
   I think what he means is that a token that you receive through fundraising with a promise of future performance is a security and not a currency.
  For example. If you spend something(USD/Bitcoin/ETH or whatever) with a promise to in the future get a new altcoin called CRYPTOCOIN then that token you receive(CRYPTOCOIN) is classified as a security and securities law can apply to that token. The fact that you used USD/BTC/ETH to get your CRYPTOCOIN has no impact on whether USD/BTC/ETH should be classified as secuirites or currrencies.
  From his statement it seems that the result of every ICO(including the ETH one back in 2013) is a token that is classified as a security. We do not know, however, if something can start off as a security and later become a currency.
  For me it seems obvious from what he said that ETH was a security after it launched through its ICO. If that's true they might have broken some laws. Maybe it has since developed into a currency.

This is stupid. Goldman sachs could easily predict cryptocurrency will collapse yet still set up a trading desk for cryptocurrency. They make money by taking a comission on a trade, they make money on volume and does not care what the current price of the security they're selling. What matters is if there is interest from their clients in trading crypto. No big conspiracy to see here.

The old timers like Warren are not saying crypto will fail they're just saying the currencies seems overpriced as an investment

Yes it's more impractical and expensive to use than fiat currencies for everyday payments currently.

This is your daily reminder that the ECB is not an investment bank.

We don't know this since we have not seen a systematic market failure since the inception of cryptocurrency. The closest we've seen is the European debt crisis. It's going to be interesting to see how the price of crypto currencies is effected if we have a larger scale economic meltdown.

He doesn't exploit currencies and countries. He exploits market inefficiencies and other people misvaluing assets. 
I know Alex Jones will have you believe he's the devil because of his political donations but in reality he's just a very succesfull investor who made a name for himself trading currencies in 92 when he shorted the pound and turned out to be correct.
   In that case he correctly saw the UK government had fucked up its monetary policy and joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism at a very unfavourable position and he made money off it when the pound was devalued. Please note that the pound in all likelihood would've crashed regardless of whether Soros bet the other side or not. 
  Anyway I doubt he will have any contact with any bitcoin trading his firm does.
 Also, this news doesn't provide any reliable sources so I wouldn't worry too much :)

It's likely that you are right but look at major stock indices that were shaking from summer 2015 to spring 2016 where the markets were down or flat. During that same time the price of bitcoin nearly doubled.
  The availability of capital willing to take risk  is probably influencing the bitcoin price a lot so if we get a major market downturn we have less availability of capital willing to take risk and price of BTC will probably go down along with it just like you said. 
  That is, unless people see bitcoin as digital gold.
