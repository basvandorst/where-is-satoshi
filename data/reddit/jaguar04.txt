Don't order 100 of them or the US might invade looking for WMDs'.

I don't think so. You can also set buy and sell limits. You can set auto buy when price hits a number you like when your sleeping

Why are buying with CC?! 4.9% fee!

SEPA transfer.
Transfer £ to their UK bank Account and your Coinbase account will be credited with £.
You then only get charged 1.5%
Fees are even lower with Bitstamp. 0.25%

Damn I really like this

You should buy on Bitstamp 0.25% fee vs. 1.5% on Coinbase (you could also buy on GDAX)
