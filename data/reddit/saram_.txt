They have another dip to survive atm it seems.

Yes and No. 
(As usual the correct answer for most questions in our World today IMHO).
The takeaway for me is that everything we read and see needs to be taken on its merit. Anything can be posted online these days and is blindly believed across all spectrums. The prob is that there is a huge amount of misinformation out there (often widely believed without clear evidence to back it up).
It is the Uncle Joe types ( who we all love it must be said) that need to ask themselves questions most~ ironically.
If we have this belief that everything is a conspiracy~ nothing we see on TV or on the news is to be believed etc.  And (worse) we are signed up to websites (for example) which promote these kind of ideas (Big Pharma is coming to get ya etc) and believe each and every one of them then we just need to question deeply ourselves (as much as the info as presented from both sides) and ask why are we thinking like this exactly.
Fact checking sites (again which need to be looked at objectively too) have an important role here and they should be exhausted before any final decision is made as to what we believe  on a particular subject.
And finally apologies for the lack of f words in my piece which prob make my argument that bit less argumentative.
Enjoy a most beautiful Friday.

So basically they are warning others to not make the mistakes that they did in going all in on the subprime mortgage crisis.
Very sneaky indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:27:16
It is always the Chinese!
We can be sure that the Chinese played a huge part in how much Korean Won has been traded.. 
Next door neighbors and makes lots of sense. They love a gamble too.

Expect another slight fall once this news of a potential trading ban actually hits the print in Europe (around now) and The U.S.
It might stabilise (and rise again) after that~ or not. If I owned some Bits, I would keep though and if I didn't (oh I don't), I would prob buy within a day or 2.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:40:20
Yes~ Nong Hyup Bank is the name.
Not one of the biggest by some distance but prob Top 5.
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:59:12
Tell me 1 other place where I can keep 100% of my wealth that is safe then?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:53:35
Easily 80k per Bit.
We'd all be rich bastards laughing at the rest of them.
Ah well~ A joy that kills.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:24:27
No thank you~ 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:31:27
Our whole being is a conspiracy~ I tell you..
THEY have gotten us. Enjoy the fantasies.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:50:38
You mean $15000~$19000 maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:57:01
Interesting indeed! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:12:53
I'd say anybody involved with Bitcoin has a 'I don't give a fuck attitude" from Day 1 tbh.
Is it really fun to be making money from others misfortune? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:48:44
No idea on the ins and outs here but can only presume it is the choice of Coinone.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:36
Or maybe automatic sells?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:44:45
Anybody who says anything negative or warns about some risks are FUD.
I think all negative articles about Bitcoin should be banned from this sub in fairness.
Take a leaf out subs like~ The Donald. They know how to handle naysayers.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:45:44
So the Chinese can still do what they want then? How about NK's?
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:35:07
People only see what they want to see.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:09:42
Well there will be 2 likely outcomes with the zero sum game that Bitcoin is.
You will either lose or you will be gain and be proud that you took money from others.
The biggest losers are people who try to gain of other's misfortune in a ponzi scheme though like Bitcoin I would say.

What impact would banning anonymous trading in Korea have on Bitcoin considering huge amounts of Korean Won is traded each day?
Interesting too that they are banning foreigners from opening crypto accounts. 
( I guess there goes my chance then).
Fears here in Korea that the Chinese or NK are in on this. May partly explain the huge volume of trading in Won.
"Under the new rules, foreigners who already have cryptocurrency trading accounts will be allowed to withdraw their assets, even after the new rules come into force on Jan. 30, the FSC explained. But they will be banned from making new deposits through the accounts. "

Might try n make a deal. 2 for 30,000$.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:06
The man with the plan has arrived..
I've decided Bitcoin is for me and now is the time to splurge!
Suit bought, Ironed and wearing.
Time to get in on this! 
Don't worry though~ I won't be going all in ;)
A little bit today and a little more tomorrow. Nothing that will break the bank. 
Been reading about this for days..
This opportunity is too good to pass. See you on the other side~ Bitcoinees.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:19
When is the next train coming?
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:36:57
So if by Monday- there is no sign of a recovery what then??
Maybe we can wait until Friday?
I have a lot in Bitcoin atm but the current trends are  very worrying.. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:29:40
I am LOVING this "nosedive"..
But as much as you can NOW! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:10:46
*Bitcoin hits 18k*
“I wish I got bitcoin when it was at 7k”
*Bitcoin drops to 6k*
“Bitcoin is crashing. I’m getting out.”
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:25:18
Anybody else enjoying this latest mini-dip?
Bought me some more Bit today too.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:13:32
Those pesky Koreans and Chinese of course! Let's just blame them
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:43:58
Let's get some facts right.
This is a dip to begin with.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:01:52
Time to get out?
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:47:09
Aren't true believers interested mainly in making a quick buck too tho?
I dont think they are in for the good of their health.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:34:39
The world may need change but maybe Bitcoin isn't the answer. That unfortunately is my takeaway. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:03:39
Nice one.
Meeting my bank manager later. He is sick of the sight of me at this stage..
All in for one last hoorah I will tell him.
It is a good job he is in on the Bit too.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:16:21
Speed dialing my bank manager- All in!
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:01:26
I've lost a few already this week :(
Jokes on them tho right? They'll be back..
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:06:37
Look~ I don't want to be dat guy but ~
I told you so!! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:04:59
What other reasons are people into the Bit except for money?
I would love to hear this explanation.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:05:03
A massive spike is imminent! Bank Manager on speed dial here the moment I see the upturn!
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:55:33
I'll be doing that :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:11:47
Please stop drinking and think of the children!
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:03:43
One of the great milestones in our lives it must be said. Now you are free.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:25:31
Delighted to say that I got out yesterday at 6,103$. The loss was actually worth it.
Bought at about 10k.
I won't lie~ It feels absolutely fantastic to be finally done with this. It felt wrong etc on so many levels to be participating in such a ponzi scheme.
I am wishing nothing but the best for the money grabbers tho.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:44:27
Need more people like you about..
The whole point was to only buy what you were happy to lose. The risks were just as well documented.
We all know the Bit will rise again ( maybe not today nor tomorrow) but soon enough.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:47:50
Get out of that garden.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:44:28
Off to the bank here in Seoul for another meeting with my bank manager! 
He feckin loves me.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:43:46
Agreed- Very exciting times ahead..
The casuals are leaving so pros like you and I can play.
