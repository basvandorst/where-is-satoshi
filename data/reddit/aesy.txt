I'm thinking about something like:
Client asks user for a password.
Client generates a public and a private key based on the password.
The public key is sent to the server when the user registers.
When the user needs to log in, the server sends a challenge. The user enters a password to generate the private key, signs the challenge, and the server verifies the challenge using the public key.

To all of you cryptographers:
Is there a way to handle the authentication so that client will never send their password to the server, and the server will never see or store the actual password?
The two scenarios I could come up with are the usual one, where the client sends the password in plaintext (could be over SSL, which makes it slightly better), and server stores it in salted and hashed form. The disadvantage is that the client needs to send the plaintext password over the wire.
The other one is that the server stores the password in plaintext and sends a challenge to the client (say, "take these random bytes plus your password, hash it and send me the result"), which can be different at all times.  This prevents man-in-the-middle from learning the password, but the disadvantage is that the password must be stored in plaintext on the server side.

Another possibility:
The client sends the plaintext password only when registering (or when changing the password). The server salts and hashes it.
When user wants to authenticate, the server asks "here's your salt; take your password, salt it, hash it, then append these random bytes to the end and hash it again". The server can repeat the two last steps, as it already knows the salted and hashed password, and verify that the results match.
