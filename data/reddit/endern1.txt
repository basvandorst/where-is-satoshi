Anyone think about how quantum computing could crack sha256?

For comparison sake the US has about 8000 tons of gold. Roughly valued at $400b USD

The inherent risk is that the coin you invest loses in the long term to another coin.

The cap is at 21 million but the miners will still make money from transaction fees. There are just under 17 million BTC currently.

What portion of the people commenting hating on speculation like this are the people who fell for FUD and sold at a loss? I agree speculation is dangerous and to blame for our current situation, but based on BTCs ATH and institutional adoption going full steam into 2018, a $50k pricetag is within the realm of possibility.

I think that’s already happened with the current price slide.

thats awkward

I agree with everything you stated besides your assertion that crypto will lose to fiat. There are plethora of fundamental issues with fiat. Many currencies will eventually have to face their massive problems or cease to exist. Some of these problems are insurmountable, for example the debt of the US and Japan, both of these countries have no intention and/or ability to conquer their debt.

Yes that’s true, most coins out of the top 50 will hit zero or near that level. Investments will consolidate around the most promising coins at that time. Coins outside the actively traded will be for special use cases or ICOs for companies built around crypto.

And you also don’t understand how Bitcoin works.

Last bitcoin won’t be mined until past the year 2100, transaction fees will still be incentive for miners to verify transactions. 
Through in through you don’t understand how this technology works.

Can I ask what percent loss you took on BTC? You were likely burnt on BTC so it’s best if you take some time to understand the tech before investing again.

All industrial economies have some portion of socialism mixed with a smaller or larger proportion of capitalism. Scandinavian countries have a significantly higher proportion of socialism within their capitalist economy.

That’s an interesting idea. Are you saying older generations didn’t/aren’t nourishing their animals properly, leading to unforeseen vet visits?

So you are saying what I said then
