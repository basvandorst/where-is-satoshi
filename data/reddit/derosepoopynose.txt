The scammers saved you $400. You should thank them.

If it is any consolation... your hard earned $6.67 went straight into the pockets of the scammers of BitClub Network. Congratulations.

You figured out Bitcoin before anyone else. You are my oracle now.

Which is weird because your name has "sovereign" in it, which would suggest you are a libertarian and care about decentralization. Big blocks is a recipe for node centralization as time moves on. Let alone the miner centralization that is already a reality in Bcash.

True. They can only keep this going as long as someone is willing to buy up their mined tokens with cold hard BTC or USD. It seems Roger and Jihan are sponsoring this thing for now but that can't go on forever.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:25:01
In what way do localbitcoins and paxful rip you off? You don't have phone service, a dodgy bank, no utility bill in your name... why would anyone sell you bitcoins without a heavy premium for their KYC/AML troubles? Sounds like you don't want or need bitcoins that bad.

Let's see how fast they remove it after the Daniquas, Shanaynays, Tyrones, Gay Rickies and Dirty Daves of this world start to form a daily line behind their BTM.

It's not interesting at all. If they are shitcoins it doesn't matter that they confirm cheaper in the next block. Hundreds of altcoins confirm cheaper for ages already.

You are literally 2 years too late. The money is gone. WHOOP! The beauty of Bitcoin.

My grandmother is illiterate and has no teeth. She'll go for the safest option with the least friction. Localbitcoins might get her stabbed, unknown BTM operators might take her money. Deloitte surely wouldn't take her money, atleast in her mind. The AML/KYC requirements aren't (very) different from other BTM's as far as i know so the choice is easy. But you have a point, my grandmother is pretty desperate for her knitting supplies so will go for the other BTM's or Localbitcoins when Deloitte's BTM is shut down. Just with higher risk. And she doesn't exist, there's that too.

I agree with you in some parts but i do think that the multinational incumbents have a role to play here. They can be an enabler by providing liquidity and legitimacy in general. Ofcourse a drug kingpin is not going to get his money in and out through a Deloitte BTM but his customers just might. My grandmother for example needs knitting supplies from China every day and she might prefer getting her bitcoins through Deloitte for as long as they allow her rather than meeting some stranger from Localbitcoins in a dark alley.

We all know that people who post these kinds of gifs and pictures are the ones who actually feel super excited inside but try to pretend the opposite to look cool. You're not fooling anybody.

Others can take your gold and now they own it. The government can jail you or hamper you to spend your gold. Good luck feeling superior about "owning" physical gold. You can lose ownership and control over physical things just as you can over digital things and regulatory things. Each have their own properties which gives them each their own advantages and disadvantages.

Not appreciating fast enough? You're (rightfully) accusing others of thinking they will be millionaires but it seems you're simply projecting. Get rid of the bitterness, buy your bitcoins back and embrace the craziness since you clearly belong here. One of us! Gooble gobble!

Good old Andreas. Always lagging 1-2 years behind with his strong opinions. Atleast he always keeps finding the right path eventually and not go full retard like some of his peers.

It feels like we're all stuck in a giant elevator on our way to the top of the building aka November. Barry let a stinky fart and we can't get out until we reach the top. He mistakenly took trapping us in an elevator as consensus to let one rip but it really wasn't. Luckily, farts always clear eventually and we should be good in the end. Lesson learned: never take the elevator with Barry ever again.

Yeah this guy is a moron who has become progressively worse as time moved on. He went from talking about news, politics, social issues and Bitcoin with some humility to full on pump n dump of altcoins with a smugness and self-satisfaction the likeness has never been seen. He wants to be an oracle so bad.. it's kind of sad. A hopeless idealist with a mental steadfastness of a caramel pudding. Avoid at all cost.
