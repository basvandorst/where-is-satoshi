You can do it indirectly, why do you think central banks hoard tons of gold ?

Gold has a cap too. And we don't prefer gold to silver.   
Both metals are expensive, gold is more expensive because it has better properties and is more expensive to mine. The only reason we store gold for value is because gold is more expensive per volume so it takes less room to store.
The price difference is based on properties, if a new atom magically appeared (let's call it Gold2), which would be exactly like gold but green, both metals would be the same price.

They don't need to promise it. They reserve the right to do it if they need to do it and that's enough. We don't need to promise we would hang them if needed too, that's implied.
Something causing a currency drop would be a pretty big problem, I am talking about thousands of indirect dead and millions of people rioting to hang the responsibles.

Gold is an atom with unique properties. And it takes money to mine any of those properties (even if you only want a substitute to gold which can be copper).
Bitcoin has no unique properties, you can create an infinity of coins with the exact same properties than bitcoin. And it's really cheap to mine a competitor with same properties.

Actually FIAT is a little bit backed by gold.   
Central banks own gold, and governments hold gold on their behalf, just not enough to back all they emitted.

I'm not talking about light devaluation. I'm talking about something that would cause people to not trust USD and ask to be paid with something else.

Survivor bias:  
You did a huge mistake, you survived it, and now you think it wasn't a mistake.
Buying an all-time spike...

Crypto has unlimited supply. And Bitcoin can fork an unlimited number of time.
When you talk about limit of supply, it's not about a name, it's about a use case. There is a yearly limited supply of Cadbury chocolate, but if everyone want to buy it won't rise to the moon because people can buy other chocolates.

Yes you did a mistake 3 times, you survived it, and now you think it was a good idea.

The best part about tipping is to force people taking things they don't need but they will still take because it's free. That's why I always tip in spinach. 
For a $5 tip for example, you get 5kg of spinach.

Demand is limited too, Bitcoin will not increase forever. Plus if people expect something to increase in value, they plan for it and buy some in advance giving it a one-time increase
