I guess the article's author doesn't know there's a hard limit to the total number of bitcoins that can ever be mined. What he's saying would probably be true if there were unlimited potential btc.

I'm fairly certain this is the good banks list, given that revolut will actually let you keep crypto in your account.

In that case, it's a sure thing.

1 - 5% seems overly cautious. If you're nearing retirement and want to focus more on protecting your wealth then yes, otherwise I'd personally want more in crypto. I'll take the high risk for potential 200% gains vs 5% from stocks.

Yeah then all the people who aren't really into the bitcoin community shit themselves as they think their multi thousand dollar investment has gone to mere dollars overnight.
Longer term I think it will make buying BTC seem more accessible, which is great.

If the bank is investigating this transaction, then they won't tell anyone this. If a bank suspects financial crime and it causes delays to transfers, then any bank employee that tells the customer that there is a delay due to an investigation is committing a criminal offence.

There doesn't need to be a criminal investigation by the police underway for it to be illegal to let customers know why there money isn't moving. Even if it just goes into internal review within the bank this can be the case.

Maybe simpler. Loads of people got in November / early December, and now are like, oh fuck I need money for Xmas presents / celebrations, gotta withdraw.
Most people's money management sucks.

No, it isn't.

Not with the current transaction fees and price being so volatile.

All great until they have to print money to pay for the bonds, causing inflation and decreasing the value of those bonds.

I don't have an issue with not being allowed to by crypto on credit card, but surely if they can't afford to pay it back then they shouldn't have such a high credit limit?

So if a company makes a loss one year, do employees get a negative salary (ie get no pay but instead have to pay the company money)?

A few major providers starting btc etfs and it will be moon time.

Currently reading a great book at the moment that points out that at the time the Roman Empire fell, no one realised it had fallen. It was only 100 or so years later that people first marked that point as when Rome fell. Great nations tend to decline in such a way that people around at the time of the fall don't even realise it's happening.
In other words, I think the decline could be father along than most people realise.

Your assuming the government makes 'profit' off their debt. I doubt this is the case.
