This botnet is actually mining Litecoin, not Bitcoin. Tracking the block data sent from the stratum server shown in the SANS post I was able to discern that it's just a stratum proxy passing connections to the WeMineLTC pool.

No suspicious actions logged for your IP at that time, like "update auth type"? Did the thief's session show "called two factor auth" and "sms auth success" in the log?

Maybe it could be a race condition in Electrum? The transaction where you received the 0.7 came in moments before you sent the 0.3 back out to the exchange.
I'm theorizing that the Electrum client set up the transaction as if you had a balance of 0.4, so 0.3 was designated to go to the exchange and 0.1 was designated to go to the change address. But by the time it went to broadcast the transaction your balance had changed so the transaction input went 0.3 higher than originally calculated and ended up being a miner's fee.
This is all conjecture, would have to look at the source code to see if this is even possible.

The payout address for that pool, 1A73ExsM2doRwTLp82rv5U36QHbBFmHD1X, is linked to another high-value address 1Nbq2XZaRsKknf5fcT2wTXvBS31PaUWSeX (they are shared inputs to a transaction). 
That address has been floated before as belonging to an ASIC manufacturer, although it doesn't appear anyone has figured out which one (HashFast says it's not them).

That was going to be my next question - where are your backups and are they secure. Likely they just tried to view the wallet on the blockchain site to see if it had a balance before sweeping the funds.
Did you reuse the wallet passphrase anywhere else? I'm assuming your wallet backup was AES-encrypted still. Assuming it wasn't easily brute-forced, if they didn't obtain the password from some other source it still might suggest they have a keylogger on your computer. Especially since they had to break into your Dropbox account somehow.

It's only a minor impediment if the hacker has malware on your machine. They can do anything you can do on your system, including intercept your 2FA one-time password to use in a hidden session, change your SMS authentication phone number, and log in to your email account, search for specific messages and delete them before you see them. 
Transaction Integrity Verification on a dedicated hardware device is the answer to the problem of theft-by-malware.

If you can do a Wireshark capture and verify that the Bitpay cert is actually being delivered by 23.74.82.234 that would rule out the possibility of local malware or a browser bug.

Like any RAT it gives the thief remote control capability. That means uploading/downloading files, viewing your screen, recording your keystrokes, etc. Unlike most RATs, this one runs on Windows, Mac OS or Linux.
Anyone who uses cryptocurrencies needs to educate themselves about these types of threats, because you are a target and you have no one to protect your investment except yourself. 
The other important thing to know is that no anti-virus product will detect all malware - you have to take additional steps to protect your coins, e.g. cold storage, split wallets (configurable with Armory or Electrum, Bitcoin only for now).

It should be implemented as a stop-gap but as BitSimple said, complacency is a problem. Once they think they think their accounts are secure they drop their guard.
People need to understand how 2FA is easily bypassed by malware, and demand TIV (Transaction Integrity Verification) instead of 2FA.

Did you log in to your account shortly before the thief did? What and when were the last actions taken by your IP before the thief logged in? It's possible they could have used session-riding malware on your computer to manipulate your security settings during your last session.
@_date: 2014-02-03 13:42:08
You are correct, my theory does not hold. From what I now read in the code, the fee is determined early on in make_unsigned_transaction, during choose_tx_inputs, and is only calculated based on the fixed_fee variable or by the length of inputs. By the time it comes to calculate the change, the fee has already been determined.

No it's not secure against malware controlling your browser. Once you provide the phone OTP to log in, the malware can take over and do anything you can do, and it can show you anything it wants you to see, and hide anything it doesn't want you to see.
Even if your phone OTP is required for a given transaction, the malware can intercept it and use it to authorize a completely different transaction than you intended.
That's why the details of each transaction need to be verified on an offline secure cryptographic device. Once verified, the device can provide a OTP that allows that and only that transaction to occur. Unfortunately these devices cost money and most banks aren't providing them to consumers since they are analyzing costs vs risks. They find it cheaper just to put the money back into the account when fraud occurs, rather than to roll out better protection for all accounts.
But Bitcoin is different than a bank; ultimately there is no one forcing a web wallet or exchange to refund your money if you are hacked. For that reason the Bitcoin community needs to get in front of this problem.

Since nslookup and your other browsers seem to properly resolve paypal.com the fact that wireshark shows traffic to 141.101.123.162 suggests your Chrome browser is internally being redirected to bitpay.com and it's not a router issue. 
My next step would probably be to make a new user account and try loading paypal in Chrome under that user. If it works, it's likely an extension you installed under your own user account. If it exhibits the same behavior as before, it's likely malware running globally on the system.
Edit: Since you reported changing your DNS settings worked, that's really weird and inexplicable. Since your other browsers and nslookup should have all been using the faulty DNS setting it should have affected them all.

You can't fully guarantee malware won't infect you as you browse the Internet, but you can make it a lot harder. Here's some tips, from least effective to most. Combine all them for maximum effect.
* Host-based firewall - most are easily bypassed by process injection, but you might get lucky and stop something.
* Anti-virus/Anti-malware - 10-20% effective at best, but you might get lucky and stop something.
* Keep all system and third-party software up-to-date with the latest patches. Doesn't prevent a 0-day exploit but will at least keep the script-kiddies at bay.
* Switch to Chrome browser for sandboxing protection - there have been bypasses but it will probably be effective in most cases.
* Use NotScripts Chrome extension to disable Javascript and only re-enable it for trusted sites where required. Won't stop all exploit vectors, but most rely on javascript to operate in some way.
* Don't open any unexpected email attachments, even if seems to be from someone you know. If you know the sender, check with them to see if they really sent it and what it is before opening.
* Use an operating system less-targeted by malware (I.E. not Windows.) There is cross-platform malware out there, but it's currently a much smaller theat by orders of magnitude. 
If you want to be as secure as possible in your financial accounts or other holdings (domain registrations or other valuable accounts), but still need to use Windows for other stuff, consider doing all your important transactions on an old laptop running Linux, use all of the protections above and never browse any other sites on that laptop other than the ones you conduct business with.

I've used it in the past. They stopped the service for a while due to worrying about MSB licensing rules but it looks like they've worked that out now? The bottom line is that it's not a scam but it is pricey and you do have to divulge some bank account info for AML/KYC purposes.

OTP is worthless if criminals manage to install the right malware on your computer. It can pretend to be you to the exchange and pretend to be the exchange to you. Offline cryptographic transaction verification is the only way to go. Exchanges should skip rolling out their own OTP devices and go straight to OCTV using something like [this](

Just used it for a small amount as a test. It worked OK, the Bitcoin transaction was sent within 30 minutes. I made sure to register the card with the gift card vendor first as suggested on the GiftCardDrainer form.
The form submit process was a little worrying, as it just greyed out the form fields and button with no other confirmation on the page or redirect showing success.  However, it sent an email confirmation shortly after and another when the transaction was completed.
It's probably the most expensive method I've used to buy bitcoin yet, but also the quickest if you haven't already verified with Coinbase or an exchange. You still need a working bank account however.

Agreed. and I think it's coming. Personally I envision a cheap offline device that can read unsigned transaction from watch-only online wallet via QR code, sign it, then deliver signed transaction back to the online client via QR code. 
A friend is working on development of an Android app to do this, currently trying to deal with the fact that transactions can be larger than QR code byte limits (and transactions tend to have a lot of entropy and thus are not very compressable). But the idea is you'd use a small, cheap Android phone kept permanently in airplane mode to hold your private keys and quickly sign transactions generated by an online wallet on a laptop or mobile phone.
I like the Trezor concept but I don't like its dependence on USB - I can't plug that into my iPhone. Not to mention the cost is much higher than a cheapo prepaid Android mobile handset.

I managed to pass it on the third try, hope it works out for you. The problems I had with the Coinbase verification system asking about ancient addresses/cars I couldn't remember details of convinced me to start the registration/verify process on the other exchanges early, even if I don't end up using them.

Good question. If it's not an encrypted wallet you may have luck with the apps mentioned in this thread. However, I have yet to find an app (Android or PC/Mac) that can successfully load a BIP38-encrypted private key from a bitaddress.org paper wallet. Blockchain and Mycelium don't seem to support the bitaddress encrypted private key QR format, and the other apps I've tried don't support loading a key from QR at all. Anyone?
