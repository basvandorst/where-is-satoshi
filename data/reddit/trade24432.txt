Did we miss the boat at 5.9K?
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:56:09
Since the day it was in 15-20K range I knew it would go down to $5-7K, which it did. Just saying! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:44
Low 6K please!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:59:43
In your experience how does volume relate to price? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:15:28
If we don't see a correction in the next few days then next stop will be 13K
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:52
Time to jump in or wait for 5-6.5K range? Does anyone see it dipping below 5k or even 1k? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:35:41
In for another dip to $7-8K?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:19:48

Get in at $4-5K sell at 100K
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:49:22
Tbh I feel like this is a similar trend when BTC was jumping around 8-9K range and it eventually crashed to 6K. It's doing the same for last few days/weeks by jumping between high 7k to mid 8K range. What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:21:44
Wont go below 5k
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:00:25
Who thinks it will dip to 5-6K? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:17:14
Volume has dropped from 87K to 62K volume taking a hit

@_date: 2018-02-06 21:49:25
What kinda confirmation? SEC hasn't decided anything just yet 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:28:26
Damn this has sky rocketed. Will it dip again?
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:35:18
What's the bottom high 5k low 6k?
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:46:16
Won't be surprised if we dig big time once again!
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:33:36
Chances of low 6K high 5K?
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:43:17
Did I miss the boat ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:58
4-5K still possible? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:59:10
True if it goes below 5k I WON'T trust BTC. I read it might go down to 1K. But I see it touching a new all time high eventually 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:59:22
So we still can go lower than $5.9k?
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:21:52
~ -$400 in approx 30 mins watch out. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:15:54
