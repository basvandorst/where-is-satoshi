That's how R&amp;D works. CEO says "get this tech which is completely new and probably needs research and have it on my desk by Monday". Estimates are never correct.
Then research takes longer because humans will be humans.

Yeah, I agree. Fiat is old as sin, and based around an architecture ingrained in every living persons mind, so it's going to take decades to undo.

Why do you take offense to this?

Alpha = feature phase
Beta = bug hunt and fixing phase

The price from fiat to BTC and back would realistically skyrocket as adoption increases globally.
However, Dec. 2017 was likely a bubble bursting, yes.

What? You don't want opinions you don't agree with?

Last year this happened right around the same time.

I, for one, find it hilarious. Mostly because those idiots will call you an idiot until they're fucked, not even beginning to try to think where your sentiment is coming from.
However, I do think you're keeping some biases. I know millennials who are better than their parents at saving and investing. Some of them have made millions, others are just normal people. However, like everything in life, there is no black and white. Millennials will obviously be the wealthiest generation, because their parents are in fact dying soon. Who inherits Starbucks? Probably a millennial. Who inherits Valve? Probably a millennial.
So you see, generation combing isn't logical. I think there are dumb, average and smart people alive at all times, and they fall in a bell curve. One thing I feel millennials lack is a sense of community, though.

That there are probably more variables.

I think you misunderstood, I'm talking about what is going to realistically happen as we approach a boring dystopia.
I deleted facebook ages ago, and I think everybody should.

I know what you're talking about, you might not understand the implications of code updates

So you can move btc regardless of fork? If mass adoption happens, will you need to move all wallets, exchanges and miners over?

This news triggers buy signal in my system?
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:11:06
Bought at $3k after this happened last year, bought again at $6k recently, figured December is going to be the dump-month again so I held off buying, currently waiting for a further drop. All my sympathies with your temporary drop in value, but just HODL. I've a theory that the BTC-price is sort of inverse with the stock market for some reason...

True, maybe successor was the wrong choice of word.

So a big security risk is for unwanted entities to gain access down the line as core contributors pass on the torch.

Also look at "social media" and "cryptocurrency", take a gander on Facebook and their Libra. Libra will be the successor to Bitcoin, because everyone already uses Facebook. The hurdle for Bitcoin is barrier to entry, you need at least a rudimentary understanding of money and some technical experience (used a computer for banking). With Libra, all you need to know is how to click icons on your phone, and when you already have Facebook installed: nothing more.
In 2020 every Tom, Dick and Karen can have $LIBRA (while at the same time giving up the small remainder of privacy they had left for nothing)!
Anyway, you'll get your paychecks in Libra by 2025 (I bet you 1 sat, Facebook will be mandatory for any professional at that point).

So what you're saying is it comes down to faith.
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:45:17
Good argument.

He's an idiot for thinking there are no upsides to crypto.

To people who don't have the mental capacity to care about the direction humanity as a whole is moving, sure.
