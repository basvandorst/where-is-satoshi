Not only did your bitcoin increase by hundreds of percent. Now, so did your likelihood for cancer!

Inflation is also good for paying off debts with cheaper money. Since the US gov has plenty of debt, they like inflation.

According to a [recent Redditor review]( the Ledger Nano S is actually a bit more secure than the Trezor AND it looks better.
Sounds like the best of both worlds to me.

Still pretty new to bitcoin but I believe governments would just pass laws making bitcoin illegal before it gets to the point where it threatens to take over a country's currency (i.e. no bank transfers in or out of bitcoin exchanges, and businesses cannot accept bitcoin).
It wouldn't kill bitcoin but simply drive it underground, resulting in bitcoin being used for personal (peer-to-peer) transactions.
