Stop being such a Debbie downer. Got any useful information?

The gap in almost all the documentation isn't installing it, it's in using it. I have it installed, I seem have the initial block downloaded, I'm at 272Gig, progress=1 and I've got 
    bitcoin-cli getblockcount
    606782
So, at this point, most things skip straight to setting a password on you wallet, and then trailing off with you're good to go, totally glossing over creating a wallet, sending BTC, receiving BTC. I'm experienced with Linux, but the last time I used Bitcoin, it was this new thing that nobody ever heard of.

To use bitcoin without relying on 3rd parties, and to help with running the blockchain ledger.

That's kind of the point isn't it? That's why it's distributed, individually we aren't going to bring the whole thing down if one of us goes offline, but together, cooperating, we build something large and durable.

I am a professional, a senior systems engineer for a large corporation, I specialize in high bandwidth media hosting. I run RHEL and Ubuntu professionally, and Gentoo personally. It's the BitCoin side I can't find sufficient documentation on, I'm good on the Linux parts.

There was no part of my question that referenced mining bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:05:36
Um, sure, or you might try r/linuxquestions
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:39:27
That's not relevant to my inquiry.

Yea, that's one of the howtos I was talking about telling you to click on things. It can't be a requirement, there is a CLI, surely you can use it.
