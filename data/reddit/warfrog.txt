Why do you think wealth inequality increased so much after 2008? The vested interests profit massively from collapse. They'll be the ones selling high before the crash and buying back at the bottom. 
You must be Aussie. Speak to someone from Ireland or Greece.

The sun doesn't have to come up anywhere. Economies crash and never recover. Look at Argentina or Venezuela. It's not a threat at all. It's simple mathematics, the history is there to back it up. 
look what happened in the UK, Ireland, PIGS and US. Banks ran out of cash, so stopped issuing loans, the housing and stock market crash was so bad the banks had to be bailed out with tax payer money. They dont have the cash to do that again. Australia is massively reliant on the housing market, the job losses would be terrible, 25 years without a correction in the housing market has built all kinds of industries on a house of cards. 
You lose the housing market, you lose the banks, you lose the pension funds that are heavily invested in the big 4, all the interest-only loan mortgages cant be serviced because there is no capital growth to springboard off, the ASX goes down, companies cull staff and noone has jobs- at a time when everything is massively overpriced. So the government will have to print money so inflation will go through the roof and interest rates will have to rise to eat the debt. Like in the 90s when it hit 17%. Now all debts created at ATH's need to be serviced under increasingly high rates and all assets will crash. This is the exact situation bitcoin was created for. It's nothing to hope for and everything to prepare for.

Yeah I know. And I agree. But I’m not happy about it and I don’t think anyone else should be. It’s not just a cash grab from the rich, it’s old people’s pensions, college funds etc that get hit the worst during hyperinflation. The rich have assets outside of cash that ride hyperinflation well.

This chart is wrong is so many places. Viet Nam has made bitcoin illegal. It isnt illegal in Russia.

If you think Trump tweeted about bitcoin to kill it then you are a low IQ peasant that has been living on mars with  your fingers in your ears and your hands over your eyes.

Don't get too happy about banks crashing, itll bring down everything else with it. Revolution isn't a painless process..

There’s no way the time traveller could be an ordinary person larping out their own predictions. Like why would somebody lie on the internet.

No fuckig shit. Everyone is bullish on bitcoin but is trying to keep it hush hush. 
Get in balls deep.

IT IS RISKY AF.
Bitcoin code is sound, has never been hacked and is proving itself more and more. Over other cryptos.
Exchanges can be hacked.
Private keys/seeds can be lost or stolen.
Government interference may change how we use BTC.
You still have to be careful.

Not sure why people are downplaying this... Look at what happened to $snap when one of the Kardashians said they dont use the app anymore. This family had every woman under 40 start wearing yoga pants and every left leaning man become non binary.
