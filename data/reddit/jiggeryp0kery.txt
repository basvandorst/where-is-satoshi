Good luck Timmy boy. Your blockchain-without-Bitcoin dreams will be smashed against the rocks of bureaucratic banking regulations, internal and external, committees, and shifting objectives. One year? More like three years.

Someone is promoting a new altcoin called "Decred" that looks like your standard altcoin pump and dump. I'm sure if you look into it, you won't find any actual "core developers" behind it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:24:58
The problem is that those blocks *can* get filled to the max by malicious miners, forcing other miners to spend time validating them while the attacker gets a head start on the next block.
@_date: 2015-12-09 13:18:03
Are they real degrees though? Or are they "degrees" from a really shitty school? Or do they exist at all?
@_date: 2016-03-06 06:24:23
Blockstream is just the same subgroup of core developers who've been working on bitcoin for the past few years. They incorporated in order to make it their full-time job.

"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded" - Yogi Berra
Perfect quote for this situation. Bitcoin is at record usage and keeps on trucking. Freeloaders are being pushed out, but who cares? We need sustainable mining, not hope for altruism as the mining subsidy declines. 
If bitcoin is "collapsing", why did by two transactions clear in the next block today? Cheaply too, I might add, because I only paid 10 cents for them.

It is frustrating that they seem to have written their roadmap in stone, and self-defeating. I want to support them, but they're being too stubborn. What a political blunder.

Me too. Sucks that he's gone.

That's fine for on-chain assets, such as bitcoin, but it's of questionable value for off-chain assets, such as a house, or a bank account (not that you were saying otherwise). Even still, the smart contract could be disputed in a court of law by another family member, making it kind of pointless - unless the inheritor decides to keep it a secret, thereby breaking the law and incurring the risk that entails.
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:18:25
 &gt; I find it scary that there still exists people thinking that "1 MB ought to be enough for anyone". 
Hardly *anyone* thinks this, except for one or two lovable kooks (somebody Jr).


We're maybe halfway to the limit under normal circumstances, when we're not getting spam DOSed.

Heh, no. Digicash was MySpace before Bitcoin came along.

Awesome moderation! Thank you!!

Don't be obtuse - the implication is that's a possibility.
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:36:20
Maybe for dead simple contracts. But for contracts that involve complexity and disputable outcomes (screwy rewards based on shitty programming, or a contract design that hilariously screws all parties in some unforeseen way), I have a feeling that courts will remain involved to sort out all kinds of messes.
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:42:52
No but it will definitely blow up some people's reputations, a certain Christ figure in particular.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:41:05
Actually it isn't that simple because the BU codebase is far behind the Core codebase on commits, so it is bound to accidentally go out of consensus eventually. In fact it [already has.](
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:50:36
Bitcoin Judas, indeed!
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:56:54
That's a really good point. We have to consider that Roger went on the offensive out of desperation because BU isn't getting significant community traction beyond a few mining oligarchs. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:26:44
Nope, it is the longest valid chain. It's always been that way. PoW doesn't matter if the chain doesn't follow the consensus rules programmed into the node software.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:21:44
Right, but you will still initially list a BU-chain at BTU if it doesn't appear to be the dominant chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:40:33
The hashrate is playing games.... they know that they can't fork without the rest of the community being on side.

Current score on [my comment]( is -41. I've never seen a score so low in the subreddit! Reflecting on it, I guess I was going against the mood of the post, but I don't think my comment was so heinous that it deserved such a trouncing. 
But this post is basically a feel-good shitpost, and the people wanted to feel good, so I guess like my comment served as the perfect antagonist to that. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:26:53
Sorry yeah... I've probably been radicalized by all the vitriol around here. I do remember the days when discussion was pleasant. I doubt that it can ever return to that because of the amount of money involved, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:36:01
Probably not but you should ask them.
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:40:50
A vision of a ship that was destined to crash into an iceberg? Satoshi's vision doesn't scale. Block size needs to remain small to preserve decentralization. Without decentralization, Bitcoin has no reason to exist.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:48:05
The vigorous reaction to BU here is partly the result of the comment and vote brigading from over the past several months, trying to control the narrative. Roger Ver's ignoble actions haven't helped either.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:52:52
They instead released a 2MB soft fork that is superior in every way to a basic 2MB hard fork, plus it ensures that the network doesn't split. How horrible!
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:28:24
What does Bitstamp think of this team of newbies (Gavin excluded, but he's not a permanent team member) taking control of the consensus rules? Does Bitstamp not worry a little bit about that? I do.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:15:05
So we're supposed to roll over and let BU proponents spread misinformation and lies about SegWit and the Core team? The damage they've done is already immense.
If defending against them creates toxicity, at the very least it denies them free rein in this forum.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:08:55
To move them, he'd have to sell his stash from one chain and buy it back from the other. That would have a tectonic impact on the markets! 
However, if he hasn't moved his coins by now while they're worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, then he'll probably never move them.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:24:54
What a stupid thing to say.

Also, system gets seriously set adrift (if not destroyed but i recognize that it can live on) if Ethereum corp gets busted or collapses (good reason to believe they still might for their shady pre-sale, the illegality of which they've handwaved away using ludicrous arguments). Tons of technical of vulnerability in their turing-complete computing system. Complex systems fail in unpredictable ways. Lots of questions as to the value of such a thing (why should every node uselessly execute the same code). Tons of problems with ol' ETH. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:22:43
It has its good days and bad days. How could it not be full of drama? People are fighting over a valuable system after all, and competitors are trying to either destroy it or promote their alternative. It's guaranteed to be filled with drama.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:48:37
Which experts in particular?
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:59:41
So why are you wasting your time here?
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:24:31
Seriously, this subreddit is filled with paid sockpuppets.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:33:20
You would think so - but that isn't what Roger Ver is saying, which is that he's raring to go with a fork with a mere 60% hashpower. Perhaps he's just bluffing.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:14:21
 &gt; People will follow the longest chain.
People will follow the longest chain that implements their favorite consensus rules. For me, that means the original Bitcoin consensus rules - the ones implemented by Bitcoin Core. Classic will become a different coin if they change those rules. Chain length will not matter.
@_date: 2016-02-28 01:36:53
Dead wrong. I'll never switch because bitcoin classic will be the losing chain in the long run. I will sell my bitcoin classic coins.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:26:04
Yeah with the participation of all groups like devs, miners, businesses, users. The problem with NYA is they excluded most of the community from participating in the agreement.

The goal is to have a censorship resistant form of money, not yet another competitor in a field jammed full of digital payment offerings. No cryptocurrency will ever compete with centralized payment processors.

And a bunch of ninnies. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:13:01
This isn't true, and you know it. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:08:58
Huh? A hardfork to implement SegWit would absolutely be controversial and would lead to something like the ETH/ETC split. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:21:29
Yes, ViaBTC is still mining the main chain. But it seems like they won't be signaling support for SetWit in their blocks. Since SegWit requires a 95% activation threshold, ViaBTC could block activation. 
Why would they do this? To force Core to implement a block size increase, perhaps. Of course, Bitcoin would become totally compromised if it could be forced to bend to political pressure. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:50:53
That's just a conjecture that is shown to be false by actual data.

That's how growth curves work.

Tech narcissist. Well said. The programming profession is filled with people like that.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:02:56
You know full well that Blockstream was created by a small subset of core developers, and that the much larger Core development *community* are responsible for what code gets merged and what does not.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:57:02
I definitely view those non-monetary uses of Bitcoin as spam. Some people got the idea early on that Bitcoin could be used as a general purpose database, and much hype was made about this, but it's not what Bitcoin does best. 
Bitcoin is currently struggling to do what makes it special: censorship-resistant money for the internet. Burdening it as a general database system makes it harder to achieve that goal.
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:48:28
This is totally false.

Ethereum is arguably a proprietary blockchain, having been founded by a single company that owns most of its tokens.

Not this shit again. The number of paranoid lunatics in this subreddit is too damn high.

Just add the correct fee and your transaction will go in the next block. The price varies with demand.. it's a beautiful thing. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:04:56
Erik's positions seem to change with the wind. At first he was all "Bitcoin is perfect money" and "I will never support altcoins". Then he opens an altcoin exchange. 
Then by criticizing small blocks, he pretty much shits over the thing that makes Bitcoin a perfect money, which is its decentralization and censorship resistance. 
Then he throws his support behind Ethereum, the Chain That Got Edited. So much for perfect money!
@_date: 2016-10-12 00:12:30
You already posted that... are you desperate?

Obvious concern troll is obvious.
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:49:49
Laughable. Ridiculous. It was a normal market movement  of around 2% that doesn't normally raise an eyebrow. Pressure had been building up for days and some short positions got closed. That's about it.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:22:10
Who's doing nothing? There are major technical improvements on the way from the core developers that pave the way for safe decentralized scaling. SegWit lays a pretty important foundation for more scaling features to come.
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:35:35
You are seriously exaggerating. That dust attack delayed low-fee or zero-fee transactions. The vast majority of normal transactions were unaffected. The test demonstrated how stable and reliable Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:08:48
Why would you assume that? That doesn't seem likely at all. We're talking about a contentious hardfork, so there will be two camps, each supporting what they believe to be the "correct" chain. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:30:06
Your side should be helping, not digging in your heels. Boo. This really calls into question your motives.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:33:00
I love it. We need to keep waving that flag whenever the miners get uppity.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:38:57
The exchanges will always follow the miners? That's a huge assumption. The exchanges will have to actively switch their software to use the new rules, and some likely will not.
Also, it's doubtful that *all* miners would switch to the same consensus rules. There would likely be a large percentage of miners that would oppose such a revolt.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:41:14
What are you talking about? LOL
