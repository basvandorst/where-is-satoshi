I understand the irony of posting to this sub talking about a politician, but this wasn't a solicitation for his vote it was merely a post that I found interesting given the disruptive nature of Bitcoin and a politician, amongst anyone, was willing to accept it.

I like Stein's progressive views on the environment ~~and science~~, but I cannot get behind her economic ideas. But I may be biased as I work in the financial markets. 
Edit: Just read she would want to decrease spending on space exploration, sorry Jill I want to see what minerals are on fucking asteroids.

The treasury department controls the money not the federal reserve. 0/10

Well yeah that’s my point. It’s their agenda to have the Yuan as the global reserve currency. And there is something they could do. They were already added to the SDR basket of currencies and given the third highest weighting behind the dollar and euro. The yuan as the global reserve currency is more likely to be happen than bitcoin in our lifetime.

China may have something to say about that

That’s not a close analogy at all.

Can someone for the love of god tell the creator of this meme that the US Treasury is responsible for printing money not the Federal Reserve.

Well for starters Fiat allows me to live still

You’re right I’m just stupid. There are other places to earn a return btw. No one is looking to an inflation-linked savings account to retire. Just stay in crypto man and you wouldn’t need to get so worked up over BofA’s high yield savings account. 
“For dollars I actually had to work for.” Lol poor you

No. It will happen again just not this cycle. The GFC was the closest we got to a depression since the depression. There were obvious signs at the time that many just ignored and didn’t want to believe. That amount excess takes generations to repeat. Excesses still exist today no doubt, but that was some unprecedented shit. It’s hard to find concrete parallels to what was happening in 2008 to today. The data just isn’t supporting that level of anguish. At least not yet.

I mean this is my job so let me just clarify very simply. Corporate debt isn’t at a record high. Personal debt isn’t at a record high (actually been decreasing). Real estate market not crumbling. Auto loan defaults have been increasing only in the shittiest of credit borrower tranches, I.e. subprime which is actually normal. I think people agree that the ultimate end game of QE is unknown. Could be good could be bad. Europe and Japan are prime examples of the problems you don’t want to get into. But to say it will cause a global meltdown of historic proportions again is honestly just baseless and false hope of your desire to watch the world burn. And I’ve moved up the corporate ladder so I guess there’s that.

No. This has no systemic impact on the everyday lives of citizens. More of just a nuisance for market participants. Will we get another recession, yeah no doubt. Will it be 2008? Not a chance.

For the same reason the Great Depression hasn’t occurred twice.
