hard disagree here
forking seems as close to a stock split as you can get in crypto, in the sense that the possibility of a fork is "priced in" to the price of bitcoin. being forkable is an inherent and fundamental property of bitcoin, and everyone invested is aware that bitcoin can be forked and that is part of its value.
as an owner of bitcoin, i also am a de facto owner for all value produced by forks, while i hold it.
edit: hold on, i have more arguments
i find it crazy that BTC holders who received BCH in the fork would be taxed IDENTICALLY to a random person who was just given BCH as charity. as BTC owners, we have a fundamental right to receive forked coins from the btc tree. we paid for our BTC, which includes receiving coins in all forks. it was not a gift, and its value came from the coins we held at the time of the split.

i think the government is part of the larger system that got us to this point. it's obviously not the sole thing responsible, but if you can point to any government-less countries that have our quality of life, i will concede the argument.


this is childish


i was generalizing, i'll also accept "one of the best countries in the world". i'm not interested in debating this point.

you did not get it for free. the price of bitcoin includes the inherent ability that it can be forked, and you can only benefit from the fork if you own the corresponding bitcoin. you paid for the bch you acquired in the fork when you initially bought and held btc.

how do laws work in this privitized utopia? like if i kill your dog, you need someone to arrest me, and prosecute me, and jail me. are you responsible for paying for those things, otherwise it's essentially legal (via non-enforcement) for me to kill your dog?

we are living in the best country in the world, in the best time for humanity in its entire existence. of all humans that have ever existed, our quality of life is better than 99.9999% of them.
and this guy wants to replace the system that got us here with a bunch of HOAs.

so if my neighbor chooses not to pay the privitized fire department, and his house burns down because no one is being paid to put it out, i have to live next to a damn burned out house?

i feel like i'm going to have to fight this in court. and i will win, because the notion that "receiving bch as a gift" and "earning bch as part of a fork" are somehow the same is totally incorrect.
either stock splits should be income, or forks should not be taxed. pick one, government.

i think the other fundamental problem with forks is that, as btc holders, we receive the coins from the fork *before* a single sell of the new coin has been made. so how do we identify what the "price" is at the moment of reception?
does that mean, if they're treated as income, the price is $0? or are they priced in terms of the first trade (i.e. if the first BCH was bought for $100,000 would we all be screwed)? or is it the average of the coins' price during the first X minutes of their existence?
