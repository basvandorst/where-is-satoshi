Wouldn't the increase in the quantity of a specific currency (presumably at the point of sale) effectively lower the value of that currency anyways?

So I have been wondering something. Let's say this uprising of Bitcoin and downfall of the current world economies and their fiat occur, what happens to the millions, if not billions of people that DID NOT invest in bitcoin? Their life savings are useless?
Maybe I have a misunderstanding of how this uprising and downfall would occur, and I would really like an explanation. I'm not writing this to hate on bitcoin, but what I mentioned above really concerns me. Maybe it won't have in this decade, but in some people's minds, it WILL happen someday.

With what though? Their worthless fiat currency? Maybe people wouldn't be totally fucked, but people would surely lose out on a lot of their money. Maybe it's just the ultra optimistic folk that think it will overthrow currencies like the USD.

Implement plans to mitigate this. What these plans would include? I have no fucking clue. Do you understand the magnitude of that issue if it were to occur? However unlikely it would be, it would send the current world into ruins for a long time. Retirement would no longer be a thing for millions upon millions of people and the unemployment rate would presumably skyrocket if 60+ year olds re-enter the job market.

I was just asking questions to educate myself, not hating on the concept of cryptocurrency. Ultimately, every single person has to stay on the gov train right now. Go buy groceries with your bitcoin RIGHT NOW. Not only could you not do that, you'd also be incredibly stupid for doing so at this point. 
Not everyone has the flexibility to invest in bitcoin as a viable savings fund.

My whole scenario was based around a scenario where BTC is used as a currency rather than an investment like it is now. sorry if I was not clear about that. Of course I left all of the details that would cause the deflation/inflation as there are many complex causes of either. My scenario was meant to paint and clarify what I thought the 'big picture' was, not point out all of the fine details. 
Edit: I re-read my post and I explicitly stated "let's fast forward to...."

Awesome, thanks for that. That's how I assumed it would work, I just hadn't seen anything verifying my thoughts.
