The issue with the reasoning is that Bitcoin won't kill the establishment overnight, so it can't be considered a threat worth shutting down outright. 
If anything, for the next few decades I expect it to slowly integrate.
There are already some small but promising indicators of such integrations. Consider USAA integration of Coinbase wallets in the same interface as you do regular banking[1]. Or investments from major banks in Bitcoin startups.
As of today, Bitcoin is a savings and investment vehicle, a digital gold. Bitcoin's market cap is 20b, Gold's is 7T. Are the powers that be killing gold?
Don't forget Satoshi's definition of Bitcoin[2]: Gold that can be carried over a communications channel.

Miners are one part of the equation. You can have miners accepts terabytes of transactions too… But if you can't have nodes that validate and relay those in a decentralized way, then it's worthless.
What we need is a good balance between miners making profits of off transactions while retaining the ability for nodes worldwide to process them. I think right now 1mb blocks every 10 minutes is low, but a limit has to exist.

I would agree with this. From what I've seen so far: It's about *power*, not *money*.

Yeah. I keep reading this time and time again. What other measures were deployed to prevent spam, that make you think you can remove it? None. The only way to limit spam is to make spam expensive. That's the very idea of Hashcash and how proof-of-work got started. Yet now we have an entire community complaining non-stop that transactions are "too expensive"!

It's not completely arbitrary. Bitcoin was invented less than a decade ago, it started at $0, and is now worth its _(hash) weight in gold_.
It's an extremely meaningful comparison not because of the amounts, but because of the fact that a unit of cryptocurrency is now compared with what people consider one of the most valuable objects in history.

However it's decided, it has to be strongly configured into the rules that everyone shares. My problem with "emergent consensus" is that the rules are "up in the air", which is the most anti-bitcoin thing I've ever heard of. It'd be akin to Core promoting a new configuration flag for the coin cap upon booting the client.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:19:05
No it doesn't. At all. People keep arguing that transactions should be *cheap* like they *were before*. Go to or listen to Roger Ver to hear this. If they're *cheap*, it costs nothing to spam the network!
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:50:32
I do agree it's pretty dumb, but I read several comments saying exactly this when it got to 1,000 again.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:33:48
Absolutely correct. If Bitcoin can't survive an attack like this, more powerful adversaries will eat it for lunch.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:56:33
Because you can't have uncapped / infinite decentralized security. It's too easy to abuse.
i.e.: just write a `while` loop on your desktop computer to generate transactions non-stop! There has to be a limit, and a price.

Does this honestly sound like an intelligent person talking to any viewers? He mumbles, lacks confidence and technical prowess. Bullish.

It's arbitrary, but still meaningful. 1 Bitcoin was worth _zero_ 9 years ago, now it's worth more than an ounce of gold. If you don't think that's worth discussing…

As  points out, I was really surprised to find Assange's name all over the mailing list (and related ones) where Satoshi announced Bitcoin. Kid's been around the block for a while

I like this guy WhalePanda. Interesting thing about the Bitcoin community: a lot of really smart people simply operate under pseudonyms, not needing all that reputation bullshit. Just focus on the message, or the code.

Your logic is sound except that the reason we call this things "bubbles" is because everything remains "largely the same" for many years in a row until a disastrous downturn happens very quickly.
You could have written this same exact post over fears of the real state market a day before the crash, and you would have been "right". Until a day later, when nothing had seemingly "changed" for many years in a row.

Good stuff but anyone who's been doing engineering long enough knows he was _no ordinary man_. Dedication enough doesn't get you to Bitcoin.

I think he's assuming Bitcoin can evolve to incorporate this. Early TCP+HTTP did not contemplate encryption until much much later

It's not a myth. There are people out there who are just absurdly more intelligent than the mean. Leslie Lamport, Dan Bernstein, Von Neumann, John Nash, to name a few.

Satoshi is several people, at least two. This is the biggest diversion in the search for Satoshi. People keep looking for *one* person, and no single human being will ever match all the available data.

"Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price."

This doesn't get said enough. People don't understand how many people are trying to make a profit by trolling the entire Bitcoin community. 
As soon as an argument can be made against Bitcoin, a huge number of users who want to profit from their altcoins holdings will start saying they want to "save bitcoin", by constantly fueling controversy and arguing as if they have a God damn shit.
What evidence do I have of this? The constant complaining about Bitcoin that I witnessed in while Bitcoin was reaching all-time highs in price. Not an ounce of positive sentiment to be found. Just trolling.

Bingo! Why Bitcoin doesn't make sense as a payment network, in a nutshell.
Bitcoin's blockchain is *slow*, but it's still dramatically faster than moving tonnes of gold around, right? So, Bitcoin really makes sense as a settlement network, savings, and things that can wait an hour to be confirmed.
Payment layers belong on top, with other tradeoffs, higher speed, and less security.

This is a very strong point. You should make it even more clear in future communications.
@_date: 2016-10-30 02:56:27


This is extremely important to underline. Ethereum is having *lots* of issues (denial of service attacks that lead to hard forks), not because their programmers are incompetent (in fact, Vitalik has recruited some really grea ones), but because of the *complexity* of the blockchain and its programming language.
In other words, Bitcoin is stable and secure *because it's simple and lean*. Arguably, it should be simpler and leaner, to scale better and be more fungible (as shown by the MimbleWimble whitepaper). But it's the best we have right now.

You keep bringing up dividends because you want your world to make sense. Yet you know full well that huge companies no longer pay dividends, and that the stock price is completely fictional.

I should mention another extremely elegant angle of proof-of-work: simplicity.
I've never seen a consensus mechanism that requires such little coordination. You can be in an island, not knowing anything about the rest of the world, only the rules of the puzzle, and participate in the network. 
This is the key attractiveness of Bitcoin in my mind. The design is extremely simple. The consensus rules can be described in a paper that's only a few pages long.
Proof of stake schemes are so complex that introduced "uncles", then "dunkles", then penalty mechanisms…
In Satoshi's words, the lack of this complicated scheme is a *feature*:


same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and rejected. 


cheater. We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid. Receivers of 
transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time 
to complete. Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend all 
they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of the 
spends becomes valid and the others become invalid. Any later double-spends 
are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main chain
@_date: 2016-10-28 08:51:49
Ok this is a very strong point:


stake is that “cheap” histories are only available to those willing to those who are holding the currency, and presumably these people value the system too much to attack it. However, because there is no universal time (and to new users, no universal history), there is no way to differentiate users who are “now” holding the currency from users who “were” holding the currency
Thank you. Andrew Poelstra is remarkable.
