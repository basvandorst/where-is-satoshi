Do you have any suggestions?  Obviously, I'm not out to scam someone, this has true value and I'm not pocketing a cent of it, as it's going for this project.  Any other form you know of to help the cause?
Much appreciated.

I'm on GoFundMe, but I'll check out lighthouse projects as well.
Thank you for you the suggestions, but I do absolutely understand!  Way too many scammers out there these days.  
Take care! :)

A comment I have received else where was, "I have seen the post recommendation in a prior post and I have not seen an answer, so I will rephrase; Why are you not trying to stream online to boast this up?  I understand what you are trying to do, but you have to realize that the FM Radio is dying.  I personally have not listened to FM radio in over 3 years, since I got a Bluetooth device for my car and there are many others like me.  Try what is working now, 'streaming, and do not try to reinvent the wheel. "
Why that is a very good point, I'd like to copy and paste my response.  I hope to the person reading this that you'd also keep an open mind.  
"I would highly disagree with you about radio being dead.  Especially in the format I plan on doing it in.  It allows you to listen to it on a FM radio along with that as well letting that same transmission be online as well.  It's covering both aspects with the same material.  
Here's just one link about radio (FM) that shows you that radio is not dead and is doing quite well.  
I think the problem with current FM stations is this practice of having an FM only so when you're in a car listening to the radio it's free, no data plan is required and when you do get done driving you can just tune right it with a data plan or at work or home and continue to listen.  I'm bridging the gap not re-inventing the wheel.  There is something to say with re-innovation of a current technology adapted to the digital world and embracing the best of both worlds.
I know you can have bluetooth in your car, but not everyone drives a car with bluetooth already built into the car or their CD players don't accept input jacks and buying equipment to stream music over an FM band costs money, etc.. 
I guess my response is that I see it as not re-inventing the wheel but as I've said bringing the gap of FM and Online broadcasting together.
Thanks for your input! :)"

There's no "fixed" 2.5 BTC, it's just presently 2.5 BTC as that is 10%.  When halving happens then 10% will follow suit to 1.25 then 0.625 and so on. It's a fixed percentage that we're using.
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:48:00
I'll give you a line break.  Why comment on something and waste your time if you're not interested?  As it clearly states, it may not be for everyone as you're giving some of your hashing rate up in a sort of "gamble", but at least we're unique.  At least we're keeping it real.  Go ahead and mine at another pool that isn't straight up with you.  Carry on.
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:34:43
I clearly state on the front page of the mining pool how it works.  I'm not attempting to make a living or make a business from a mining pool.  I am not over excessively charging fees for running a pool or charging maintenance fees.
It's simple.  You mine, you earn ~90% of your regular income but have the chance to win 2.5 BTC as every single block we mine someone will win 2.5 BTC.  We also give out prizes in addition to the 2.5 BTC Jackpot reward per block.  If you don't get it, then you're simple, because it's really quite simple.
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:40:18
Yeah.  I'll take a pack or two of smokes a month for maintaining a pool, I don't think that's too much of a request for offering a unique pool setup.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:18:32
Oh, I most definitely am.
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:25:42
We would have to be gambling a fiat currency to be gambling.  Since you're gambling with hashing rates and no actual money exchange is happening and when a winner, wins the Jackpot, we are moving a commodity to the winner.  What the winner does with their winnings is up to them.  No actual USD or fiat currency gambling is technically taking place as you can clearly see.  I'm off to sleep.  I know you'll continue to troll, that's alright.  It was fun anyhow, thanks for the amusement.

That's what I'm working on.  It's a reason I put it up on Reddit ;)  Though your hashing may not be much, people see a pool in a whole and think that they won't add to it.. Every bit counts when mining in a pool, the people who think this type of pool is good and interesting should be joining in, not staying behind and waiting.  The big miners want to see interest in it as well...
@_date: 2014-07-29 06:03:28
You have to be an active miner to be able to be entered into winning the 2.5 BTC.  That's the incentive for mining with us is the chance to win the 2.5 BTC while being an active miner.  
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:39:42
No.  It's PPLNS for the remainder ~90% (88% to be accurate) as I've stated in the first paragraph. 
10% goes to the Jackpot
1% goes to promotional giveaways, such as mining hardware, gift cards, etc..
1% goes to the pool for upgrades, colo costs, maintenance and as I have clearly written on the main page of the pool.. Sometimes some smokes for me running it.

If you feel you really must, then go ahead.  I'm sure they're going to send their top agent down on the case.  I bet he'll even get promoted to Director for busting such a huge case too.  I bet I might even get the death penalty for offering such an absurd idea!!
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:19:21
You should learn how to use the keyboard first.  You might be mining into null.
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:44:33
What do you mean, exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:14:55
As I said, it may not be for everyone.  I figured why not? People already Gamble their Bitcoin away on Satoshi Dice and other forms just like it.  Why not risk a little bit where there really is no house edge.  There is no 'business' to be made from it.
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:54:31
It's 10%, so when the halving takes place then it would be 1.25 BTC and then the 1% is taken to ~0.125.  Everything follows suit.  When that happens the price will also follow suit by increasing as well.
Bitcoin isn't going down in price. Sure it's volatile, but it's only going to rise.  Valid question you asked, but it's a very simple one to answer too.
