Can’t handle conversations with people or viewpoints outside your bubble?

I have no BTC or crypto positions.

STORE OF VALUE
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:03:36
Ah yes, the safe haven that swings 10%+ a day. Great store of value, much better than something like the USD.

This is good for bitcoin! Nobody needs them!

no, you can buy on margin, for example if you have $50k USD in your account some stock brokers will let you purchase $100k USD worth of stock.
if the stock drops 50%, you just lost your entire account because you still owe the margin. (though in practice you will usually get liquidated earlier, at the judgement of the broker if your position moves against you too much). and smaller losses where you use margin will still blow up your account if they happen over and over.

That’s the effects of the current stock market. The post above is about what the situation would be if that crashed.

Market cap does not determine liquidity.
And wow, some fucking guy says "they're legit", exactly what I was looking for. Who needs an audit?

do you understand what a dead cat bounce is?

banks have to notify the IRS of any deposits over $10k.
And staying under that by depositing $9999 (or any notable amount) every week is its own crime called structuring. And the IRS may seize suspicious deposits believed to be structuring.

well unless you sell to someone for 450k cash in-person and then slowly launder it (same as you would as a drug dealer), the IRS would easily know.

Looks like someone is upset they're bleeding money. :)

because it's not worth acknowledging. you think people will move from investing in companies that make money, to investing in pump and dump crypto? what the fuck does "implying themselves as businesses mean"?
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:27:44
you mean like insider trading, pump and dumps, price manipulation, and flash crashes? I agree, all of those are easier with cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:24:29


you are fucking retarded. if by "real money" you mean low liquidity pump and dumps fueled by tether, you would be correct.
it might be surprising to you, but if you're just trying to make money fast stock options exist. you could've bought SPX puts on friday morning and made 2000% in a few hours. try doing that with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:28:20
yes a MASSIVE crash to the prices of 3 weeks ago.

Wtf do you mean “no”? 
You asked for other ways to speculatively invest. I’m telling you options are a financial instrument to do that, and can give you far greater returns than bitcoin.

Lol the classic humblebrag and then ask for advice.
