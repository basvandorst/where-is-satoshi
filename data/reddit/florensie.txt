Hackers cashing out perhaps lol. No immediate reaction from the rest of the market though.

You know because bobbleheads bounce back.

I have a VPS but VPS storage is waaay to expensive to sync the whole blockchain. How do you do this?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:55:36
Do jingle jam! I'll probably be donating to.

The way trading works is that if people expect it to go down in the future, demand goes down and supply goes up meaning it goes down immediately. This is called a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not sure what will actually happen because the expectations aren't always right. 
I'm a poor student and I want to buy a new mechanical keyboard. I'll need to sell some Bitcoin but I'm willing to take the risk of seeing what happens. If it dips I'll have to keep my BTC, if it's up I'll sell some. I've got 12 days until this group buy ends.

The reason Linux on desktop isn't mainstream is because, just like crypto, it has some hurdles to go over. Linux has application compatibility problems (people want to use their trusted windows programs) and crypto has scaling problems.

If you buy using limits you don't have to pay a fee.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:48:11
Agreed. To be completely honest, I posted this for the upvotes.
edit: Didn't expect to get more upvotes from this comment. I like this sub in a weird way.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:52:21
Oh god.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:11:51
You should learn about stop orders on gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:02:47
Wholesome ass fuck.

What stops people with a lot of BTC to sell high and make the market drop to then buy the dip they just created?

Pretty sure he meant why he's given the option not to have a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:33:14
Only with when buying/selling with limits.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:01:18
I like how it "crashes" at one point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:42:40
Quick where do I buy? I've got a 100 euros on my bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:29:46
Yep, see this:

When was BCH forked? Wanna know if I have any forked coins.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:12:54
I'm in EU and it has always shown Bitcoin.com at the top.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:25:07
Yeah I just realized. Who the fuck is going to develop BCH any further lol. It certainly won't be the Core devs.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:22:54
Yo I've gotten Grafana up and running on my server but I have no idea how I need to get a dashboard like this (or any even) up and running. I use nicehash as well so could you maybe give me some directions here?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:22:09
Imho it's still is and always has been a load of crap.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:11:32
Oh no I didn't expect to see ROI here. I need to know this for an economics test tomorrow. D:
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:53:44
Is it really trending or is it just tailored to your searches/whatever?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:24:49
Isn't gdax and coinbase the same thing?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:14:17
I don't get it. If a hard fork occurs doesn't that mean that you get twice the coin essentially doubling your money?
Also I'm not quite sure what this software mentioned here does. Your coin is automatically copied to the other chain no?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:19
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:57:29
Totally agree. I was just laughing with how biased is. Sadly I don't have any BCH as I bought in to late. I'm thinking of sending my money to ETH until this is over.
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:40:38
Huh ok, but how does it actually work?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:13:26
I just convinced my father to accept Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:39
I know how it works and it's easy. Just said I didn't expect to see it here.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:26:59
Coinbase needs you to be 18 too. You can use Local Bitcoins though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:00:20
They have a bigger block size which I don't understand why we don't have it. Off course segwit will also increase block size but a how can 2x hurt?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:30:34
Idk, I guess I'm stupid. My bad lol.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:43:41
What are shitcoins and how does nicehash use them? I've been mining on nicehash for a couple of days now and it afaik the payouts are in BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:56:33
This doesn't explain anything at all. If anything it made me even more confused.
