Probably someone gets blind as well

He probably means mining bitcoin. Yeah i 1060 can be profitable for mining several altcoins like zcash but not for bitcoin.

Yeah i do, setting up a mining rig is pretty easy actually but i can comment only for nvidia cards, contrary to what most people believe they are better suited for mining ( lyra2rev2 based coins are very profitable ). Note however that current gen cards are probably at the last stage of their gen, at least for nvidia cards that is, new gen is expecred this spring and that means better performing cards with lower power draw and cheaper as well. If you however want to set up a rig right now, i would reccomend to set a mining rig with a few gtx 1050 for now. Get what you actually need meaning a mobo, cpu, ram all that pc stuff and a rack to place them. Get however a good and big power supply that will leave you room for more powerfull cards when the new gen hits the market. The 1050 cards will probably almost pay for themsleves till then. Then you replace them ( either sell them to friends relatives or e-bay / craiglist ) for the new gen cards. Dont worry anout degrading them, mining at 60% power draw is less harmfull for the gpu instead of gaming
As for what to actually mine with the gtx 1050, zcash is the most profitable for these cards and it is a fairly stable and promisive coin with a nice community ( it is also the one i currently mine with my 1080ti's). Or you could start mining for nicehash which will get you paid in bitcoin instead of zcash and is easier to set up as well. There are youtube videos that guode you through every step for setting up a zcash miner or start with nicehash.
Feel free to PM me for anything, always glad to help

It is, for my 1080ti's at least. Although lately lyra2rev2 coins has been the most profitable, for nvidia cards at least.

Every-time i hear about the 27% unemployment rate, i laugh and cry at the same moment. It is nowhere close to that, more like 35% or so and even higher for people below the age of 35. And most of those are just part time workers, working for something like 300-400 euros. With the exception though that life here is much more expensive than countries like Romania or Bulgaria.
But hey, at least the ( illegal ) immigrants and so called refugees have free food, wifi, clothes, a place to stay and many more right than the taxes paying citizens.

I have read around at zcash forums for the zcash4win that " running a node strengthens the network ". How exactly that happens for each crypto and how the networks/coin/people exchanging the coin benefit from that? Like in bitcoins case with bitcoin core

Yeah i know. But it would be too much of a hassle to change our memes now

Tesla cars are nice. Too bad they are useless here in Greece since there are no place to charge them and no one in sight for at least a few years.
My dream brand is a Ferrari though

Greek citizen here and for many months you were allowed to withdraw onky 50 euros / day. Boy the lefties are a cancer for our country
