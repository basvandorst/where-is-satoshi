Is there anything you can do? If they haven't sent you a postcard, could you do a chargeback?
They mention that you could get your coins five days after the campaign end date...do you know when that was/is? If those days are referring to business days only, there could be hope yet. It is sketchy that they're ignoring your emails though.

Still, it holds promise for Bitcoin's future. This is exactly what we need.

What exactly are you trying to get me to vouch for? It sounds like you disagreed on something, and it doesn't even matter anymore because his comments are deleted.

Upvoted because I want to know too. It almost seems too good to be true, which most of the time, it is.
Have you tried it out? I may--I'll let you know what happens if I do.

Hey OP, you asked me if I'd bought coins successfully from these guys in that other thread, but I figured it'd be easiest to respond here. The answer is that I never bought coins--I was in the same boat as you, looking for feedback on this site. I found a couple positive ones, but they were from people on the SheepMarketplace subreddit, and that was their only post on that account. I actually saw that you were still waiting for yours, so I backed off buying. Good thing I did.
The funny thing is that I also emailed them about a glitch on the site yesterday, and they responded within a few hours. So them ignoring your emails is definitely not due to their hectic schedules.

Coinbase only accepts Visa credit cards at the moment. If yours is anything else, that is probably why it won't verify.

Don't be too hard on yourself. Many a man has been blindsided by the big B. Just take it as a learning lesson and remember in the future to always be suspicious of anything that seems too good to be true. As my dad always says, take that money that you've lost on this and use it to buy a lesson.
Can't say anything about the legitimacy of this since I've never used it, but you may want to look into [Gift Card Drainer]( if you're looking for a simple way to get btc.

Technically, they're saying you would get your btc by 5 days after the end of the campaign at the latest. Playing the optimist here (just for the sake of speculation), could they be pushing the campaign date back due to the low number of investors they have, since their system is based on pooling money together for higher purchasing power? Not saying this is likely.
