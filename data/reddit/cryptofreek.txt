Two ways to avoid fees with Coinbase:
1) Send through email via Coinbase (off-chain transaction)
2) Send through blockchain via GDAX
The first is great for sending to newbies, the second is great for getting around high bitcoin fees.

Only if it is a loss in dollars. It's possible OP meant they had 5 BTC and after some trading ended up with 2.5 BTC. But if BTC appreciated 1000% in that time, it's likely they've realized a capital gain in terms of dollars with that trading activity.

You made 3x on your investment. Congrats. Make sure to set aside enough for 2017 taxes, which will count as short-term income.
If you're desperate to get back in, I would DCA back in. You're right that the trend could turn any minute and crash heavily. But it might not. It's not something that can necessarily predicted, and you don't need to predict it to be successful. Just invest what you're comfortable with, and if Bitcoin takes hold you'll do well long-term.

There were replay attacks on Coinbase, stealing Ethereum Classic after the DAO fork. But they were transparent about it and credited their users the full amount.

There are some exchanges that list it as BCC and users who call it that, but BCH is a better choice.
BCC is primarily used by BitConnect, which is considered by many to be an unsustainable ponzi scheme. Check out this marketing video and decide for yourself: 
BitConnect advertises heavily on sites like coinmarketcap.com. They also show up in the top  cryptos by market cap, even though most of the trade volume is from the BCC Exchange and they pre-mined most of the supply.
Hopefully newbies don't get burned.

This isn't really the place to discuss the merits of altcoins, but I'll indulge. Check out for more in-depth discussion. I've been a long-time Bitcoin holder, but I've been putting new money into ETH instead.
Litecoin I view as complementary to Bitcoin because of Segwit. The future of Bitcoin is Lightning Networks. These are second layer solutions that settle on the main chain. Litecoin and Vertcoin both support Segwit and therefore Lightning. So my investment hypothesis is they'll share in Bitcoin's growth. Since LTC/VTC market caps are much smaller than BTC, they potentially have more room for growth.

The way for it to be not be gambling is to look carefully at the risks in your portfolio and diversify them away as best you can. That includes:
* Risk a particular asset class crashes (cryptos, stocks, bonds, real estate)
* Risk that you lose your health or job
* Risk that you don't hold assets experiencing growth (hold many types of assets to avoid underperforming)
* Risk that you invest too much money at the peak of a speculative bubble (timing risk)
Sure, 2016 was good for Bitcoin and 2017 was spectacular. But Bitcoin actually performed quite terribly in 2014 and 2015. It's totally possible that 2018-2020 will be another bear market for cryptocurrencies. Can your personal finances handle that?

If $500 is a lot of money to you, you could space it out into two purchases. $250 now, then $250 maybe 5-6 months from now. There's a threshold on Coinbase of about $200 to pay the lowest fee of 1.5% (instead of the minimum fee of $3), so that's a good number to use for dollar-cost averaging if you can. I highly recommend reading about dollar-cost averaging because it reduces timing risk during crazy speculative runs like Bitcoin is currently experiencing.
But also ask yourself. Should you really take investment advice from some random redditor with a clear conflict of interest like myself? I hold bitcoin and directly benefit from you putting in any amount of money. There is nothing about Bitcoin that magically guarantees it will increase in value.

It would be fascinating if someone sustained a spam attack and created a backlog on the BCH chain right now. A period of full 8mb blocks would be an interesting test for that blockchain, and those kinds of shenanigans always seem to happen around forks.

Yeah those Ethereum folks are a neat bunch.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:34:23
Yes you are right. The rising price is primarily of significance to speculators. It does not make it more usable as a currency in the short term. In the long term a large valuation makes it better, because it means there is more capital (and therefore liquidity) in the asset. But short-term volatility is incredibly high and Bitcoin isn't quite ready to scale to mass adoption at this moment. Look into the block scaling debate and lightning network if you want to learn more.

Practically though, SPEDNing can be inconvenient when the mempool is congested. And if you're a law-abiding tax-paying American, it's annoying since you're realizing gains on your investment.

It could just continue plugging along at some fraction of BTC's value, similar to Ethereum Classic's relationship to Ethereum. That fractional value is volatile and of course BTC and BCH are highly correlated assets, but there may be a diversification benefit from holding it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:21:11
Doesn't one just need to split on the 2x chain? My understanding is that coins don't need to move on the original chain.
Some users are definitely going to get hit with replay attacks without protection. Hopefully a winner is established quickly and they only lose coins on the minority chain.

If you have over $1mil and 90% of your assets in Bitcoin, then putting another $20k into the same high-risk asset is definitely gambling. At that point, you are getting close to what you need to retire for life and should start diversifying into a "Fuck You" portfolio. More details here:

For the average bitcoin speculator, triple-HODLING is not a bad plan. Every crypto bubble seems to be accompanied by a major crisis, and this one is pretty straightforward to navigate. Hold coins on a wallet you control, be wary of replay attacks, and split your coins at an appropriate date (after November). Your portfolio will remain fork-neutral and you're guaranteed to hold the winning Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:45:32
Perhaps an exchange will offer 2x futures trading before the fork? That happened with Bitcoin Cash and the futures did end up being a good predictor of the ballpark value the coin would eventually settle at.
This article stated the value fell from 0.15 to 0.08 per coin in one day before correcting back up to 0.109. Coinmarketcap currently has BCH at 0.105, so the information from a futures market seems like it would be useful.

I thought you laid out the possible scenarios quite well, including the most surprising (and seemingly most likely) case where we end up with 3 Bitcoins in November. You gave a nod to the different sides of the debate, without going to deep into any one position.
As others mentioned, the only important thing I think you missed from a neutral perspective is the lack of replay protection. Specifically the steps Bitcoin users can take to keep their coins safe on both chains after the fork. It makes sense to do it closer to the November though. This video was perfect for giving some advance warning and context about what is happening.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:53:31
They *could* both fail, but that's why you'd consider holding onto Bitcoin Cash as well for that long-tail risk. It seems unlikely both will fail though, as blockchains are pretty resilient. I bet they'll both survive, similar to ETC/ETH. Also holding ETH/LTC is a way to diversify against Bitcoin's specific risks, although a collapse of BTC would probably affect all cryptos.
