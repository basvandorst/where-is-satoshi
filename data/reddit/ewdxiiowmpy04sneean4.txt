It'd take literally a few milliseconds to jump back through the blockchain (Assuming bitcoin-qt was started using -txindex (Implying companies like Walmart would use Bitcoin-qt, and, not a custom-coded client easier to interface and do what they need to do)) to verify they have transactions.
If a customer can't wait a few milliseconds, then, well, tough shit.
As for doing it however, what if the service does check, and, they find it. What do they do then? "Oh, sorry Ma'am, seems like we can't accept these.", "Can you give me a refund?", "Sorry Ma'am, these are unconfirmed and thus issuing a refund now could result in the refund being invalidated by the fact that the TXID we reference could change."

3. If there's many, then, my second point stands up. If I use company A, but, the seller only trusts company B, we're kinda screwed here.

Maybe not, but, there's a huge difference. You know relatively quickly someone has 'dined and dashed', and, hell, I'm sure sometimes you can catch them.
Bitcoins are basically giving you a two to three day window where everything looks "Okay" for the seller.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:59:05
Issue with that is nodes start to forget about transactions after a few days, if your TX isn't in a block by then, it's bye-bye.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:00:01
Replied to it for you.
Sure, you can retransmit the transaction, but, then it's a race, transaction that has a good fee verse transaction that doesn't, even if you win, I just have to wait a few more days again and I get another shot, again, and again, and again.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:37:36
I'm assuming you weren't out to scam them, though, were you?
Obviously it's going to have "no problems" if you (The buyer) isn't trying to cause a problem, but, if huge companies like Walmart do start accepting BTC, I can assure you there are going to be problems from people buying stuff, then, double spending it the second they leave the store.
Hell, maybe not even 0.000001% of people will do it, but, that's still someone.

Can I ask why you rely on blockchain.info (Based off your twitter feed)? They're practically down every other week for a few hours, I don't understand why people use them.
The bitcoind API is just as simple as theirs (If not simpler), is 100% local (And thus more trustworthy), and, doesn't go 'down'. Sure, it requires a slightly beefy (RAM mostly) server (~1GB), and, takes a couple of days to setup (Downloading blockchain, verifying blockchain, scanning for balance), but, it's all automated doing that, and, once it is, tuh-duh, your service is never down due to someone else's fault.

I admit I only read the first half of it, but, the idea I got from it was:-
1. User presends money to multisig address, 2-of-2, user is one sig, trusted service is other sig
2. When user wants to spend money, he asks the trusted server to sign
3. They sign, but, they only sign once, meaning no double spends
Issues I instantly see with that:-
1. How do I get funds into the service? What stops me from sending them a never-confirming TX? Do they make you wait for a confirmation before signing it? If that's the case, that seems somewhat useless, unless you're sending it from home in advance, which, seems like there's another flaw. People are going to have to prepare money they're spending on that day out, and, it means that that company will be able to confirm that you spent all of X money at all these different chains, as, the company will know what chains you're spending at, enabling profiling
2. What if I load one BTC on there today, go out, see a company has a great deal and I want to buy something for two BTC? I suppose it's decent for small transactions (Like a coffee), but, for large things, it's still a pretty poor alternative.
3. Who says what company we trust? Being a bank isn't all that easy, becoming someone who signs a BTC address is easy as download bitcoin-qt. What if I use company A, but, I go to Walmart and they only accept company B?
Don't get me wrong, it's a better idea than just using BTC, but, it still doesn't solve it.

Difference between that is you can be caught shoplifting, if they see you walk out with an unpaid product, you're obviously shoplifting. In my case, they know you've paid, they let you walk out, then, after you're out, you invalidate the transaction.
That's an issue, I agree, I doubt many people will do it (Either moral issues, or, not in the technical know-how), but, it's still an issue we have to consider, I feel.
@_date: 2014-03-16 09:28:27
But it's no where near the speed a simple:-


@_date: 2014-03-16 02:26:40
Refer to:-
Since Mark0Sky didn't want to, I'll attempt it on you, give me a BTC address.
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:40:34


Yay. Cheaper transactions for me!


What's the reason behind that?
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:42:22
This. Unfortunately, I couldn't, I was on a Linux operating system at the time and was like "What's this? Probably malware, oh well, can't verify".
@_date: 2014-03-15 10:18:14
I really want to send some money to the one satoshi address just to fuck with their counter.

Because blocks are generated using leading zeros in a SHA256, you're never any "closer" to generating a block. The difficulty is basically "How many leading zeros we want to verify you actually worked on a block".
Because it's almost like rolling a huge dice (With (if my calculations are correct) 16388408927273877504 sides, currently) until you land on one exact side, you can roll it ten times and still be no closer than you were when you started.
Imagine we have a normal dice (Six sides), and, I say "Roll a four, I pay you 25 bitcoins", you'd roll:-
Well, that's not 4, is it? So, you roll again, are you any closer to rolling a four? No.
Well, that's still not a 4, so, you roll again
Damn, we've had duplicates, at this point, we're super unlucky, but, we're still no closer to getting a damn four.
Oh crap, we got a four, now the entire network as a whole verifies that we spend awhile rolling dice until we got a four, and, that's the proof-of-work.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:10:01
But it's already highly documented, it's all over bitcointalk, have you never seen people say "Oh, I sent funds with too little a fee", and then people reply "Don't worry, just use pywallet to delete the transactions from the local client, then wait a few days for the network to forget about it"? Or, the huge warning wherever you see "Createrawtransaction" saying it can result in funds being never confirmed?
There's a huge difference between you not knowing of it and it not being documented. To trigger it, all you have to do is match isStandard() but not match the miner's minimum mining requirements, which, honestly isn't all that hard.
If you really want, give me a bitcoin address and I'll show you, however, I do admit, it takes three or four days for the bitcoin network to forget about the never-confirming transaction, so, it's not something I can prove to you before this thread is dead. Oh, and, also, it's not 100% (A miner can obviously include it), I'd say it's probably about 70-80% of the time.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:22:36
The time and effort? I could make a bash script, I'd say no longer than ten lines long, that could do it automatically, something like:-


info=$(bitcoind createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"$txid", "vout":"$vout}]' '{"$(bitcoind getnewaddress)":$(parseAndGetInput($txid, $vout)}')
vout=parseAndGetNewVout($info) //Always zero, only one output
bitcoin sendrawtransaction $(bitcoind signrawtransaction $info)
//Tuhduh, now $txid and $vout are transactions that are ten items deep in fake transactions that'll (probably) never confirm.
It's honestly no effort what-so-ever, it takes about two minutes to do manually, and, can be automated so easily.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:45:05
You might want to start worrying then, I've seen times where it's gone 6+ blocks in under a minute, and, I know it's happen because I was super lucky when developing my bot, finally finished development, needed to test off test-net, submit transaction, one minute later, "You have six confirmations!".
I tried to find an easily historical view of all close-together blocks, unfortunately, couldn't find anything off google and didn't really want to spend three or four days ripping data from my bitcoind just to post this.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:16:25
This. Delays and fiat being hard to transfer make this unlikely to ever be executed, but, it is extremely late, so, I may be misunderstanding something.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:22:31
How many confirmations do they wait for? What happens if there's like a two-hour break in the network (I.E. nobody manages to mine a block)? What payment processor do they use?
I may consider buying from them next time I need food (I.E. in a couple of hours).
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:09:18
Escrow services? How will that help? Unless you mean prearranged off-the-chain account balances that companies agree to use (I.E. basically PayPal), then, I fail to see how this has any signification.
If you are talking about a prearranged off-the-chain account balances, doesn't that somewhat defeat the point of bitcoins? That company can easily:-
1. Issue refunds
2. Freeze balances
3. Profile you (As they know exactly what companies you're using)
4. Identify you (I.E. you may be anonymous hopping into a random taxi, but, you're not if you're paying your Doctor)
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:45:07
Fair enough, I suppose you're actually properly programming and not half assing it? I.E. implementing an driver class that can easily interface with whatever API while using constant function names?
I could never be bothered to do that, so much effort, I do it once and once only, everything is hard coded and interlocked. Change one thing, change the entire program. I suppose better you than me.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:59:08
Feel free to try? Scamming people like this? I have, multiple times, not actually to steal from them (I give their goods back), but, I've taken small $1-2 products off a bunch of developers like this, and, emailed them explaining how.
Took a few TF2 keys off automated TF2 key traders on tf2outpots, a couple games off steam game sellers, etc...
I, obviously, refunded them all, but, least the developers finally changed their script to accept it only after one confirmation.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:20:42
Surely you just refund exactly what they paid you?
If they paid you 1BTC when BTC was $10, then, it shot up to $200, but, they wanted a refund, you send them 1BTC. same if it was $200 then dropped to $10.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:05:14
Not really instantly, the way I do it as an example takes threeish days (Wait for the nodes to forget about the transaction). Even in the case that the seller rebroadcasts, I just have to wait a few days more.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:02:17
No blocks for 34 minutes isn't really weird, it's all random. We have large gaps of an hour or so every few days.
Anyway, my local clients (Bitcoind on two servers, bitcoin-qt on desktop) have had no issues and payments are still processing just fine. Blame whatever sites you use.
