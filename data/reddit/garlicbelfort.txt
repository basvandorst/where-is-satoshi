They made $1 billion from hardware sales last quarter. If they can keep it above $500 million on average it's not even half the valuation of the PS/PE of high tech index.

I'm sorry you simply don't understand how graphs work.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:11:38
Nope. The crooks at Bitfinex printed extra money so that they could trigger shorts and create a candle while Bitmex users are getting rekt. Nothing unusual, that's just how Bitfinex makes money.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:07:05
OR maybe you don't understand that there is an infinite supply of unrelated graphs to which the bitcoin graph can be fitted in this manner.
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:54:14
It may be. It may not. 
Was amazon a bubble? It's beside the point. the argument isn't whether it's a bubble, the point is that you can fit a graph of some form of economic scenario to any event. That doesn't make it relevant.

Cause if the miners go away, bitcoin works just fine. Oh wait..

Only idiots don't realize that it doesn't matter HOW or WHERE they sell. It's the same ecosystem of buyers that use funds to buy. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:29:11
That's where almost everyone is wrong. The US laws apply in extension to ANY entity that provides financial services to US customers. 
See. BTC-E, MtGox etc.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:53:25
So let me get this straight. You buy $300,000 worth of miners from a company in China with no previous experience of importing hardware. 
I mean come the fuck on.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:06:35
How is it a grand conspiracy? They are not audited, they are owned by the same former Ponzi scammers from Bitcointalk that own Bitfinex (that stole $100+ million from U.S customers). You have to be almost mentally slow not to realize they are not operating as they are required. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:57:33
People that don't know how the law works always have the best opinions on how it SHOULD work. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:15:19
Whaaaat? Insults not related to the factual issues with your text-wall of whining? It can't be. I figured you would explain in detail how dumb you are for not understanding that $1 billion in wash-trading funds can push a market. 
Oh well, bless your heart mongo.

A puberty must be taking it's toll on you. It will be OK kid, don't get so upset. I'm sure any day now your dad will find another love interest and you will have your sister all to yourself again. Bless your heart..

If you are so insecure that you think an Oil backed ledger token has any relation to Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:52:22
Oh dear, you really might want to finish special ed before you get cunt-punted by your sister. I'm sure you think OTC sells or after hours quotes are 'irrelevant' to the stock market, but you see when you pass puberty and finish 5th grade you might learn this isn't so. 
Stay off the led paint sweet child.

Here's some light reading. Not too many big words and some fun pictures thrown in.

I am crying. How retarded do you have to be to try to slander someone on reddit, and not use an alt account when you are the admin of a scam-pool that has ties to Bitfinex and Tether. Seriously, give up swapkid.

Fud? $6 fee was very low in December. Average ran around $16
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:30:07
Cause you can live comfortably inside 'a bitcoin' right? Guess who has no clue what investing works like. Jesus.

By that logic you have to be paid to write this comment you dumb bastard. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:25:13
Oh dear. Yes it's a HUGE difference if a buyer with $400 million buys OTC (removing $400 million from reaching the market and causing sell pressure) or buying across the market (removing $400 million from the market . . . see how this works retard?). 
So yeah, maybe take some Econ 101 before acting like you have a fucking clue what you are talking about. You slow fuck.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:10:30
Sure kid. Maybe spend more than 15 minutes in crypto before you pretend you have a clue.

Do you have any even ballpark clue how trading and taxes work?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:31:14
I feel bad now. I didn't realize you were actually mentally handicapped. Forget I said anything. God bless sweet child. I wouldn't worry too much about what fun-coins I play with. I can most likely buy and sell your whole trailer park without cold storage access.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:46:02
No you are missing the point. It's simply a Oil vehicle, nothing to get all whiny about. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:03:42
Yep, poor kid isn't even smart enough to use an alt-account. Whalepool sure has some 'stable geniuses' in their ranks. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:29:54
OR you are not smart enough to realize that taking $400 mil off the market through ANY means has the same effect. Doesn't matter if it's OTC or not since it siphons 'market bound' funds anyway. Jesus how do you people think finance works?
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:39:09
I couldn't care less. Simply pointing out that some noob telling others what is 'pretty obvious' is always wrong.

Hello paid Bitfinex shill, would you like a cell on the left or right?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:57:04
He's an idiot that doesn't understand that market cap isn't the same thing as value or liquidity. Or just an alt account for one of the Ponzi criminals behind Tether and Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:15:11
They got 'hacked' and replaced 35% of user funds/Bitcoin/Ethereum with 'Bitfinex tokens' against their will. Many people lost HUGE amounts even at the time and Bitcoin was at $300 back then. 
The Bitcoin they stole from my account would.be worth over $300k at the top in December. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:25:42
Yeah yours was. Since Bitcoin and a house isn't even close to the same thing you retard.
