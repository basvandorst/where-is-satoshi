an extra hurdle for vote manipulation bots.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:51:57
you're right, but that's the compromise. as long as apple insists on being a gatekeeper to your own phone (which they will), this is the only way forward if you don't want to jailbreak

Backup is being worked on. It's on the issue tracker.

You can't send money with bit wallet, making it pretty useless in the real world. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:56:41
of course. thanks for the work!
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:27:20
wasn't aware we had a business model.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:59:00
fuck these wall-street fat cats who think bitcoin is just another tech bubble that they don't understand, but that they can milk by riding a wild roller coaster of speculation. i have no respect or those who want to make "money" by bitcoin speculation, trying to squeeze profits by driving volatility. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:47:47
I'm not! I think there is a difference between people who are trying to buy BTC low and sell high and those who think that crypto currencies are the future of money. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:34:44
Yeah that was them. Bedsides this, they've also been critical in keeping snowden free. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:05:43
yes, but then it will be controlled by a single private company (coinbase)
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:09:33
I love this, but what worries me is that coin base always makes it easier to use their own payment system that use the actual block chain. For example, when you pay for something and the merchant uses coin base, coin base defaults to sending the transition "off the record"

They can't stop it, but what I am worries by is their ability to hurt growth and stability

Th economic times is an extension of the times of India, which is a gossipy tabloid rag, the Indian equivalent of the daily mail. All their articles are click bait. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:28:28
Wow! Thanks! I'm also working on something else inspired by the bitcoin protocol; in excited that this is sort of tipping is possible!

51% attacks? also, centralized systems are inherently more prone to failure as there are fewer independent components that need to fail for the whole system to collapse. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:09:44
inevitably, yes. but if a large organization that is responsible for a good chunk of the network hashrate goes under, the system as a whole suffers.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:35:29
can confirm, this is for the App Store version.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:52:47
please tell the developer this! or ask for a pull request.
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:23:26
thanks! that worked! 
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:24:34
The app uses scan code, an app on the iOS App Store to scan qr codes. I don't think it's also on android, but the api is public and anyone can write an app to do the scanning. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:21:11
What a trashy website. They're too dumb to write anything so all their content is screenshots of what other people say on other websites. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:43:20
Can you tell us the hash of your app so we can check?
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:05:41
Type md5 filename in terminal

I actually did buy it with bitcoin! Got it a week ago. Now the NSA has linked that bitcoin address to my physical address. Yay!
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:27:51
that's *one* utility. to call it the *main* utility is just wrong
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:38:38
yeah, it's just that i don't think we should fight this battle. apple will always be a dick and keep banning things, and developers who don't show us the code running the app essentially say "trust us, you have no choice". there is an alternative-- HTML5 apps that apple won't mess with for the foreseeable future, which co-incidentally are necessarily free (as in freedom)
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:27:57
that's the point of getting a patent. now they can clobber others with it. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:25:24
Please pass this onto the developer. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:33:55
hmm, that's a bit of a problem. we've reached the point where we need specialized hardware to get the job done, and that necessarily means that it will be decreasingly decentralized. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:31:39
thanks for your work, but i want to point out that there is no real way (thanks to apple's idiotic policies) to confirm that the app we download from the app store is in anyway the same as the code you put up on github, other than trusting you. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:16:49
forgive me if i'm missing something, but why isn't some sort of mining support included in the standard bitcoin-qt client? everyone downloads that, and that's the best way to keep mining decentralized for now. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:56:41
Look for tpp.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:09:44
ok, but what about GPU mining? a rather large number of people have GPUs on their computers...
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:38:31
is there some way to switch countries in the app store, and download coinjar?
also: why the hell is apple banning coin jar only in the US store? what's the rationale? 
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:27:08
What's the problem with the fact that it runs in safari? (Technically it runs in WebKit as the base browser used for HTML apps is different than the full safari browser) 
Is it security you're worried about? Or UX?
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:35:13
hmm. interesting. i didn't know it worked that way. i still have problems with the fact that we can never verify the code it's running, and essentially have to trust the app with our bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:43:54
This is a shit source, please try not to link to articles here. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:31:36
If you think of bitcoin as an investment opportunity, then I'm glad you are leaving. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:55:34
But systems are path dependant. A widely accepted bitcoin system could be reliable and stable, but if we can't get there because of hedge fund managers lured by rumours of 100% short term gains I will be pissed.
