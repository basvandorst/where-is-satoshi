5000 is hardly a number Amazon would care about.

No where did you say "needed to address policies and other issues on their service.". Learn 2 write.

I know I knew nothing about it and slowly saw these "ChangeTip" comments being made everywhere, which made me come to this reddit page.
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:10:54
I'll start with electrum for now, so many programs I'll end up pretty confused if I download them all at once lol.
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:57:59
Hmm, first attempt didn't work, maybe the tip needs to be at the end? 
Newbie here, someone sent me 100 bits so I'm just testing how to send to someone else.
100 bits ------
Edit: Nevermind it did work the first time, just didn't show up right away.. What happens if you tip and have nothing in the account?

Not all dogs in shelters come from abused/shady homes. We have a couple shelters here that take in pregnant dogs, raise the puppies and then put them up for adoption. I'd say with these dogs, you 100% know that they were taken care of because it's volunteers who raise them, not some person who's breeding dogs for profit.

Hi random guy on the internet
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-10 23:35:39
Welcome fellow noob :) Just got here today as well.
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-12 17:15:46
Changetip is kind of addicting lol.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:27:08
Awesome, lets keep it going!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:49:59


Thanks! So it's doesn't have anything to do with the other wallet sites?

If his dispute says you never sent the item, and you have an email from him saying he has it and going to send it back, forward the email to paypal. Should easily win the dispute as he lied when launching the dispute.

Cool, I just checked and I had ~$15 worth of BTC there.

People were going to dump after the fork, cancelling just made them dump quicker.
Everyone should have expected that to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:59
Why not? BCH was free coin and trading for $550, so who wouldn't want another free coin that cold trade for $500+? 
This is why alt coins were going down for the last month or two. People were moving everything into BTC to get free segwit2x coin (which they would probably have sold right away), and now they're move it back into their alt coins.

It's 3AM in China... A little more then a few hours ago
This news came out 1-2 hours ago:
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:11:32
I don't think we'll see the bottom until September 30th. I can see it dropping to around $3k-$3.1k when China wakes up in ~5 hours. Then it'll probably slowly drop to around $2.9k by September 30th. After then it should start picking up again, and then sky rocket when China announced it's exchanges can be opened again under regulations.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:14:22
ehh, pretty risky.
I was thinking of buying some this morning while it was ~$3k, but then I got stuck in a meeting and it was $3.4k by the time I got out. I'd have sold it again in about 12 hours from now when China wakes up and starts the dump again.
Might be a good idea for the next few weeks. Buy in morning after China dumps, sell at night after North America pumps.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:05:56
Exactly. Then a few weeks/months from then it'll sky rocket when China lifts the ban after putting regulations on their bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:58:41
So you think there will be no reaction when China wakes up and finds out now all of their exchanges are closing by Sept 30th? lol.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:39:32
It's not done dropping yet (imo). It was around $3950 this time yesterday. Stayed there for around 3 hours and then it dropped to around $3250 5 hours later. I think we'll be waking up to $3000-$3100. But after tonight, it shouldn't drop much further.

China went to sleep knowing 1 exchange was closing. Since then, it's been said that the other exchanges have meetings tomorrow (or I guess today for China) with regulators which likely is to tell them to close down.

Doesn't China only represent like 5%-10% of bitcoin now after the massive dump a week or two ago?
It's not going to drop much more.

@_date: 2017-09-14 15:26:11
I would say it'll keep going down (although at a much slower pace than the last 2 days) until September 30th. Then it should start going back up. Whenever China gets these exchanges regulated and re-opened, it'll jump back up quickly.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:07:03
I like how all these ban rumors come out while it's 1-2AM in China. These people might want to wait until it's business hours over there before starting rumors.

It sounds like the phone is fine, but the server the app connects to is offline. Have a feeling the only one who can get it resolved would be the app developer.
Try emailing them, support

lol, the guy got a phishing email. Nothing to see here.

Maybe just in the USA? I'm in Canada and didn't get anything and as far as I know they still have them here.
Edit: Apparently it's also Canada. Weird, didn't get anything about it and of course last day to sign up for the class action was 2 days ago lol.

Some people (including me for a short while) would buy boxes of coins, search them for rare/silver coins and then deposit the regular coins (I opened a TD Bank so I could use their 0% fee coin machines).
