I first heard of BTC somewhere in late 2009. It looked fun, so I tried to mine it but after reading a few things it looked like too much of a hassle.
I believe I created a wallet and had perhaps a few btc or maybe 0.5 btc or so thanks to these free faucets. But you know, it was worth only a few cents or so back then so I didn't care too much.
Then again in 2010 I saw that it went up, and I believe it was back then that I read that story about someone buying one pizza for 10K BTC. But I was studying in Japan, and had better things to do than to be interested in this kind of stuff.
Reading this thread, there are many people who think about "WHAT IF" and I think this is a really bad mentality. What is done, is done. You can't change the past, you can only change the future.
So, is BTC worth investing? I don't know. I'd wager to say yes. Only time will tell how much it will be worth.
You have made mistakes in the past, I'm sure you're making mistakes as of right now, and you will still continue to make mistakes throughout your life. That's how things are. Learn from it, but don't keep thinking about it constantly. Just move on with your life.

Yeah. There are several groups on discord and telegram. The biggest group I know of has about 80K followers.
But what I've heard is that it's mostly the top members (aka founders and their friends) who make most money out of it because it's them who decide which crypto they will trade, so they buy a lot of it, then ask the group to buy said crypto until a certain point, and once it's around that point they all sell.

Now I imagine someone who programmed a bot to buy BTC each time someone gets the frontpage with this gif being confused as to why they just bought 10 BTC, only to go to Reddit and find out this gif has been posted again, cursing at OP and downvoting everything they posted until now, frantically reporting this post as being spam and misleading.
