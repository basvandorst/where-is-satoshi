But then how else would Google track your usage?

There may be some evidence I missed too, so please feel free to correct me.
Gavin is a kind-hearted, honest individual (or at least seems so), and a great developer to boot. But just like every human being, he's a bit socially inept. Aren't we all? We're all emotional sheep who would rather believe in Santa Claus than accept the reality that Santa is dead, forever.
I don't care about his github drama. He doesn't even work on the project anymore so it's obviously not a big deal.

For some reason, this is the most entertaining part of the Wikipedia page:


Could have potentially gotten away with an extra $20 million, but couldn't spell "foundation".
Oh, also... If you're reading this Gavin, you don't owe the bitcoin community shit. You've done your job. You've done great work. I've read many a cringe post, perhaps a YouTube comment, criticizing you. I just don't get it.

You can't spend the money, you have to launder it. A single $50,000 purchase when you're paying $1k for rent a month is enough to tip off the feds in some situations.

Care to elaborate?
