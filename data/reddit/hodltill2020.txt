Good luck losing your life savings once it hits $0.10

I'll give it 1 more week so we can all buy at $6k
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:00:07
I am all into POS Masternodes nowdays. It's something I think will take off in 2018 once Shared Masternode websites become popular for investors. 800% yearly ROI? Yes please.
My two favorite coins are DEV and BITG.

I have a bad habit of deleting reddit accounts...
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:39:03
Rip :(
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:35:44
It's just sad to see that someone entering the marking now (after you've told them since December) and can make 3x the amount of money for the same investment.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:37:46
$8k sure, slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:52:53
*ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?*
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:05:56
I'd wait a couple of months before it's new ATH and buy there so the price goes down. If I buy it then you know it's time to sell. Since I am not buying it's probably a good time to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:52:43
Not pessimistic, just where parabolic curve sits. I mean we could get there earlier but I don't think we are quite there yet. I would not be surprised if we get there earlier but I would not complain if we did not hit ATH in 1.5 months.
If we did not hit ATH after 2 months I would adjust growth rate more.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:44:29
As a whale i am waiting for $3k, maybe I'll add more once it hits $1500 again.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:54:12
I'll name my kid Cucklord Maximus if we get to 10k by end of the week.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:55:36
Worst is on altcoins where difficulty goes up from 5,000 to 500,000,000. They mine 1 block and leave right before difficulty increases and wait 1 block for difficulty to go back down.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:24:26
Hey, it's me your brother...
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:35:46
Who has so much fiat to dump?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:41:17
I would have sent him 1btc if it was segwit
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:24:20
100% Bitcoin is now "boring" when talking about it with people so you know it's a good time to get in.

@_date: 2018-03-26 19:03:34
Sure, they can't compete with ASICs but to give you an idea a small botnet has a power of 100,000 GTX 1080tis.
Good luck competing against that when mining altcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:27:42
What charts? Haven't looked since December, is it up?
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:01:32
2 months for new ATH.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:51:14
Yep, also number of botnets are growing. It should be renamed from "Proof Of Work" to "Proof Of Cheat" as it only attracts botnets. This is why Proof Of Stake is so much better.
POW Altcoins have a higher chance of failure as you can't compete with 100,000 computers who dump it all on the market. Good example would be Garlicoin which lost 95% of initial value.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:54:21
This is where we are supposed to be ~7800 but I don't know how My Gox dumpage will factor in.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:42:02
Thanks for letting us know.

Dude, not gonna lie but your mom sounds hot
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:00:15
Someone already chewed it
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:31:21
Basically botnets came with 100k computers mined anything that could be mined and sold them cheap. Now the market is recovering.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:24:25
What else do you have hidden up in there?

An inverse marge simpson seems to be forming here.

Upside down marge simpson forming?
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:33:35
My bot bought at 7400 and just sold at 6800...
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:33:43
It's been a 2 day battle, would be surprised if it ends before EOD tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:26:26
This market is best example of "Calm Before The Storm" I have ever seen...
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:17:43
Can you explain like I am 8 years old?
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:22:57
I send any BTC address that posts on Reddit 0.1 BTC each. Enjoy.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:00:05
Just shorted at 8350. Not time yet. Probably rebound to 4500 before we go up again
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:37:42
Well he only said he found this at his friend's college dorm. So yeah, he could have drawn it himself.
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:55:38
You mean he isn't going to use cryptopia? Darn
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:41:53
Eventually we'll break through the 9k barrier and then 10k is within reach. Then wallstreet will run around yelling "BTC over 10k AGAIN!"
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:17:03
But mah indicators and moving averages are telling me to short
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:21:49
Yeah... I got screwed over pretty hard. It's ok... used to it by now.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:04:26
And down to sub $7k we go :(
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:49:26
Yeah at least buy $20. $10 is only enough for two-three lambos max.
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:50:42
I think that's taking it a little too far. I'd opt into a hardware wallet personally if you have 1+ BTC invested
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:13:40
1. It's Bitcoin Cash not BCash.
2. Bitcoin Core is losing dominance at record speed while Bitcoin Cash is growing.
3. If BTC is digital gold then BCH is digital platinum. No reason why two can't exist together.
At the end of the day the coin that gets promoted more will win. Roger is doing a good job at that you gotta give him credit.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:21:06
These past week has been brutal. Bears are not giving way, some big shorts in play.

Upside down Mr. Burns 137° inverse pattern coming up
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:26:13
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:44:10
Step 1: Pick any random number
Step 2: Wait until BTC is that amount. If not wait a couple of years
Step 3: I CAN SEE THE FUTURE
If it doesn't pan out blame FUD
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:42:19

@_date: 2018-04-23 20:23:30
Thought I was the only one
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:36:47
They're stopping decentralization by being able to block certain vendors like WikiLeaks from accepting Bitcoin donations
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:25:51
Same reason why we have gold and cash. You don't want to go into a store and trade bricks of gold. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:27:49
I clicked "Buy" button. Had a couple of bucks laying around
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:45:00
Ok, let us know when we can continue. We'll just all wait till you are done.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:42:53
My life is mostly about dumps. Huge dumps....
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:43:34
Dude they charged my three times, bank charged me $160 x 3 additionally and then coinbase refunded me the money and I got charged $160 x 3 by bank again.
If I have to go through that again....
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:43:05
So the money you throw at it keeps falling?
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:22:59
I'll only believe it after I see 3 straight days of green.
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:28:45
BTCUSD 6940? More like 6700. Am I right guys?
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:54:19


Stopped reading right there

Sorry I tripped on a wire
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:28:18

@_date: 2018-04-20 13:04:32
Shorted yesterday at 8350... doh
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:07:56
If 7.6 billion people buy $10 of BTC we can move the market.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:22:26
Bears can't even break 8800 this is a good sign.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:26:42
No lambos for at least another 100 years
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:02:03
You mean dump...
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:06:54
If you troll in a subreddit expect to get banned. At least make a good argument to why BCH will fail.
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:15:58
Does that mean it's going up or down?
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:56:53
Damn.. I thought asking random people for 0.5 BTC worked on reddit ;(
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:09:49
I'll still call a bear market till we hit new ATH.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:44:33

Back in 2010, a developer bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.
You could buy a pizza for a bit less than that now.

@_date: 2018-04-12 00:02:36
Same feeling here. Nothing really shocks us anymore, even if it were to go down to 6100 not many people would care at this point. Looks like we're all betting for 7500. After that lamboland.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:23:38
I love the fact that you also made a reddit username with the same name. 10/10
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:36:56
Thought the whole thing was a bull trap again
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:50:35
Better than being stuck at 8250 for days
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:54:07
You still got 18 minutes, let's see.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:23:40
Probably heading towards $3-4k now based on the trend
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:40:04
Eh, more like sub 5k before we see 8k again. Moving averages are still pointing down.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:17:57
Yeah and test $0.50 and then test $0.00005.
Real numbers everyone
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:32:15
Future you says thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:16:44
Already shorted at $8112.70 easy money. We're probably heading toward $2-3k range based on projections.
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:36:53
Did you guys hear about that guy that just invest his $800? Pretty good use of $600 if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:48:32
This is the stuff they don't teach you in school. You need to have at least 30 years of crypto trading experience before your mind can even fathom this pattern.

Pretty sure that would just crash the entire market and make bitcoin obsolete
@_date: 2018-04-22 04:21:04
I'll just buy more then. For now it seems like we're heading towards new ATH
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:25:05
No it was 9001
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:44:23
Baby jesus, she's a looker mama!

Bro imagine some of us who are now down 12k since December. You wake up every day to see 500-1000 down, hoping for just 3 days of green back to back.
Nope, wake up to a gigantic red middle finger.
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:58:08

Ok I'll stop tomorrow.
