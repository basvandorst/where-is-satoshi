It is so coinbase can maximize profits.

If you get your coins at all.  Coinbase will cancel your order if the price doesn't move favorably in coinbases direction.

the government makes bad deals with private company's to build the roads i drive on.  I modify my veichile to be more efficent after i buy it by installing software that would be illegal to come on my car stock.  I also modify my exhaust to be more efficient and less green.  
Ill never agree that government will solve any problem, ever.

please stop talking bad about coinbase, the investors will get nervous if you guys keep this up!
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:34:35


Wait you are citing those as good things government has done?  We must not drive on the same roads or watch the same news about the US military's actions over seas.

I don't know what you are talking about, my name is brian armstrong and i like to post about bitcoin.  Im not the CEO of bitcoin or anything like that.


Are you talking about the one who endorse the most corrupt candidate that conspired against him with the DNC?  The guy with a half a million dollar lake who bitches about the 1% right, just trying to be clear here.

They offer a $500 / day ACH transfer along with bank wire

why would they kill off their customers then?  Just dont buy shit thats not labeled or pay to test it your self if you are paranoid about whats in it.  Or sue them if they harm you in some way.
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:57:46
Just don't report it to the IRS.  Fuck em, they aren't going to come after you for for a single bitcoin either way.
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:02:56
So we should have elected the candidate that was given more corporate money than any candidate in history then?

sup bernie bro.  Why do you dislike jeff fucking sessions?  While i may not like everything about sessions, i like him more than the alternatives.  
No one has to mention hillary, a new attorney general was going to be appointed by the new president and the two of em were the only candidates with a shot in the general election.  What rock have you been living under?

How are they suppose to respond.  By choosing to do whatever is best for you special snowflakes at any cost?
I pay taxes and too much is wasted on stupid frivolous government bureaucracy and shit.  If i want something done right, i take care of it or pay for it myself.

I don't agree with giving them more money and centralized power when they are producing shit results.  Id rather starve them of cash and diminish their power unless the produce better results.
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:29:29


yeah no worries when you get your coins.  Coinbase may eventually get around to giving you your money, just keep waiting chump!


Yeah hit up coinbase support and they will ignore the shit out of you like everyone else.

Jeff sessions is an improvement over lynch or holder, i don't know what people are so upset about.  Hillary would have picked someone worse than sessions so I'm looking at the situation as glass half full.

what makes them spoiled.  I find the spoiled ones are the liberals looking for universal basic income, single payer healthcare, free college, ect.
Government creates problems for everyone.  They never solve anything, just kick the can down the road so to speak.
