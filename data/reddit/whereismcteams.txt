I opened a ticket on September 29th and had it resolved on about June 10th.
Expect to wait several weeks for EACH reply.

Hey guys. 
Can anyone suggest a website where I can sell my 1 BTC?
My account is currently restricted from Coinbase and that'll probably take a while to fix. Anyone know any other exchanges that would accept a resident from Florida?

I'll check them out. Thanks

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:37:07

I sent it 4 days ago and it even says so on the link I provided
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:29:00

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:34:34
Well that was all the bitcoin I had and I just wanted to buy something
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:24:50
well i wasnt being serious but ok 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:22:40
I was under the assumption it would get confirmed faster but I guess not 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:20:28
did i spell it wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:33:23
How do I know how many bytes a transaction will be ahead of time?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:09:45
Okay dude I've some pretty stupid shit because of dares/peer pressure but this is ridiculous 
Like, you a are a complete moron and I'm saying that for your sake
All to you if you actually WANTED to do it, but jesus christ dude have some **common sense**
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:54:25
Because the goal of bitcoin is become a mainstream currency?

I only started using Coinbase recently but their customer support response times are atrocious. We're talking about 1 week+ for each response. 
It's actually insane how many automated responses they have in place; you can tell they really don't want to talk to people.

I'm not sure if this is the direct cause but my transaction got confirmed shortly after using the site.

same. used a fee of 420 sat/byte and still not a single confirm after an hour
