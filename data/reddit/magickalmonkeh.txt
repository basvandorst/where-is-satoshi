Did this document appear before gox went offline? If so, that's one thing that it has predicted correctly, and it would make me strongly suspicious that gox deliberately leaked it in order to crash the market.

I think you did very well considering you had no idea what or who you were going to face until the last second!
It was a good move to punch the ball back into their court with specific examples of how traditional banking and finance has suffered comparable problems.
Security of their money is something the common man and woman are rightfully concerned about - Bitcoin isn't susceptible to the 'card cloning' type of attack that causes Visa, Mastercard, Amex etc to suffer huge losses through fraud on a daily basis. It's worth remembering that the finance industry considers those loses acceptable.

to someone that's never used classifieds, what's the difference between ebay classifieds and a 'buy it now' style auction?

i love France, Italy, Spain but their political and legal systems seem to be old-fashioned and nightmareishly bureaucratic to get caught on the wrong side of

I actually can't believe this hasn't already happened. Think about who owns crypto right now - mostly geeks ie gamers.
I wish I had the resources to create a free-to-play MMO with bitcoin rewards (or altcoin, doesn't really matter).
So where does the money come from for these rewards? Sponsorship. 
So you might have a Quest of the Golden Arches mission, sponsored by Maccy D's. The game developers take some of the sponsorship of course, and put the rest in as rewards. 
Say McDonald's pay $10,000, the devs might take $1000, and then set the mission to give out $10 to each player who completes the quest, which would mean 900 players could do that quest before it disappears.

lol OK the old bullet in the face routine. 
So this means 'no paypal' - surely a Good Thing.

gox is preventing people withdrawing BTC from accounts on gox - but there's nothing stopping gox themselves withdrawing their *own* bitcoins and selling them elsewhere right now

It seems that bitstamp has had their customer database stolen. There have been a bunch of phishing emails sent to bitstamp email addresses over the last few weeks - some about Mt Gox - and people have received these even with email addresses that were only given to bitstamp.
Make sure you have a strong password on your bitstamp email! 
Also change your bitstamp password, as the password hashes are quite likely to have been compromised also. It's probably a good idea to regularly change passwords on all exchanges as it's evident that we the customers are unlikely to be informed when our details are stolen...
