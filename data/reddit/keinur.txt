Physically removing the wifi antenna is just the "paranoid mode" of making sure the COLD wallet cannot be hacked remotely. It's just another layer of security, but the device can remain unmodified with the wifi disabled via software through the android settings. It all depends on how much security you want, and how many bitcoins you store on the device. By using the "paper wallet top up method" there's no need to have all of your bitcoins in the COLD wallet, just enough for some days, and keep the rest in bip-38 codes safely stored and ready to scan when needed.
I use microsd cards to update the software and make backups in the COLD wallet device, so that's the only possible weak point of the setup. As some malicious code might be injected through the memory device to the system, but I find it quite unlikely. Also making sure the offline android device is not rooted and has the right administrative permissions helps.

I've been using this Bither feature for months and it really is the  most secure and convenient way of safely storing bitcoins while being able to use and spend them. Works great.
I use a cheap old android tablet wich I -phisically- removed the wifi conectivity as COLD wallet, and my everyday phone as the hot wallet to process transactions and create sign requests. They both communicate through QR codes for each transaction, and voila! Bitcoins sent without compromising the cold wallet at all.
When the cold wallet is running low, I only need to scan a bip-38 paper wallet with the offline device, and it tops up immediately. And considering it is COLD, offline, the BIP password never gets compromised.
I can't think of anything simpler, and safer.

A company does not necessarily need to make INSTANT profits. Some can sustain long periods of losses, expecting a high future reward (go see any startup company, such as Twitter...).
Again, the larger the company, the longer it can hold operating at a loss. And if this helps wiping out the competition and clearing up the future, they will do it for sure.


In terms of accountancy, an investment and a expense are very different concepts depending on how you look at something. You have to think in terms on a company manager, taxes, investment and expenses.
Moreover, in many countries *buying* bitcoins -to invest- is not legal, or regulated. But investing in or *renting* some equipment to burn electricity and sell the resulting product/service while keeping a chunk for you, it is.
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:28:02
Also Localbitcoins is the most convenient way of buying BTC without compromising your privacy. In every other exchange you have to send personal information and identity documentation. 
There's lots of potential Bitcoin users that like its anonymity features, and Localbitcoins is the place to go for that.

They don't need to make it unprofitable, they only need to **reduce margins** dramatically. 
The cost of mining a bitcoin in a large company can be **noticeably lower** than the cost of a small company, due to economies of scale (cheaper electricity, cheaper ASICS if bought in large quantities).
If the large miner spends/invests 300$ to mine a bitcoin, the small one may need to invest at least 400$. 
If you're the big player, and you expect that anyway soon each BTC will be worth more than 1000$, you want to take as many of them as possible, and that means kick the competitors out.
It's happening as they succeed in this strategy: for the first time in many months the difficulty is reducing. Many small miners are giving up their operations, and leaving their field to the big ones.

You have to ignore the Paypal checkout button and go ahead filling the form fields through the next step. Then you'll have the option to pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:08:56
It doesn't. If you consider safe using a CC anywhere is because there's always a 3rd party that provides you support in case something goes wrong, for a fee, and only under certain circumstances.
Using a CC is, in Bitcoin terms, like carrying around your private key right in your pocket, and handing it on every payment. Anyone could use it by just taking a picture or copying the numbers.
But the point is how "old" feels this "new" feature in IOS8, of using a camera to scan payment information in a plastic card. Makes you realize how superior Bitcoin is, compared to current major payment methods.

Free market? Do you live in disneyland?
Miners hold a very large (and increasing) amount of BTC. They get 3600 NEW bitcoins each day. Don't you think that gives them *some advantages* to manipulate the market?
They only need to sell a small part of their holdings at the precise moments to keep the BTC price at the levels they want.
Wake up. The BTC market is very **illiquid**, go google that to learn what it means, and what are the consequences.

Low price makes mining an unprofitable business for smaller players. 
Large mining consortiums push the price lower to get them out of the market in order get more chunk of the 3600BTC that are mined everyday.
The reward halving gets closer and closer, and there's a race to mine as many blocks of 25 BTC as possible before they get -twice- more scarce, and therefore twice more expensive.
@_date: 2014-12-24 12:26:03
If the supply halves, then the item doubles in price. Easy as that.
Imagine you're a mining company, your expenses sum up **800,000$** per month to keep your ASICS running and hashing (electricity, rents, maintenance, equipment repairs and upgrades, wages, etc.). 
Let's suppose that with the current reward phase of 25BTC per block you're mining around 4 blocks per day, 100BTC per day, which makes 3.000BTC per month. If you sell all the bitcoin production at let's say 300$ per BTC, you'll get **900,000$** per month. That makes a profit of 100,000$ per month (before taxes).
When the reward halving arrives, with the same hashing power you have, the BTC output of your miners will be HALF of that. So still 4 blocks per day, but that's only 50 BTC per day, 1.500 BTC per month = **450,000$** per month. Your company is LOSING 350,000$ and this happened instantly from one day to another.
So your company NEEDS that the bitcoin price goes up from 300$ to 600$ in order to maintain the same profit.
Other way to see it, if a tap is pouring 10 liters of water a day and it suddenly reduces to 5 liters a day, that means less water is available, and the increase in scarcity will bring an increase in prices.

We all agree that the current and short term price of bitcoin is a highly speculative one. But this is not only because of traders, i have a theory about the recent price slide to 275, and basically it's based on the interests of some large groups of miners.
I think there are large mining consortiums pushing down the price, in the same way as in the oil market currently some large producers (Saudi Arabia explicitly admitted it) are dumping the price of their product, with one clear objective: kill the competition.
By keeping bitcoin price low, these large miners put a very heavy pressure on small/medium sized miners leaving them out of the market, operating in losses. Just the same way Saudi Arabia pushes the (more expensive to extract) Shale Oil from USA out of the market at prices under 80$ per barrel.
And it's working. How many of us gave up as"amateur" miners in the last months?  Simply put, the investment in mining equipment and electricity does not break even at these prices. No if you don't have access to cheap ASICs and cheap power as whale miners do.
They clearly want to hoard as many bitcoins as possible before the reward halving, and until then there will be no mercy in this battle.
If I'm right, there won't be moon for bitcoin price in the next 18 months.

Not sure it has something to do with this, but the LTC/BTC exchange ratio is in historic low levels since october 2013.
There was also a dip in BTC price around that date from 200$ to around 150$, and you know what happened afterwards...
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:58:54
When you make 1800BTC per day (let's consider that these consortiums are only making half of all the new bitcoins mined in a day), you can easily dump 6000 or 7000 BTCs per week and still hoard a large sum at the end.
Dumping does not mean selling 100% of your bitcoins as soon as you mine them. There are much more intelligent ways of accumulating during a period and releasing sales in strategic moments to maintain the price low.
You only have to see what happened in the last rallies. Very fast climbs, and slow continuous decline to previous levels.
Well played they can even make money with this game of keeping the price low.

Wall Street is always on the lookout of something to make money with.
So far they are all-in on SP500, bond markets, and other still-ever-growing assets, but that won't last forever.

One funny implication of a large scale power shortage worldwide, would be that new blocks would suddenly stop being mined.
Consider the current huge difficulty level in the network. If 90% of the miners shut down at once, the remaining hashing power would not be enough to find a block in quite a long time.
And as the difficulty only readjusts itself after a number of mined blocks, if mining takes forever, then the difficulty adjustment would take ages to arrive to fix the situation.
Funny, but possible. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-30 09:45:00

Yeah, but any -full- bitcoin you own now, you will still own it in case the protocol is changed to add more decimals.
Imagine there are only 100 bitcoins in the network, and each has 2 decimals. You own let's say 10 of them. That's 10.00 BTC you own, or 1000 satoshis.
Now Gavin comes and changes the protocol to add 2 more decimals. There are no NEW full bitcoins in the network, you own the same stake as before, but divided into more chunks. So you still own 10 out of the total 100 bitcoins, but now this is 10,0000 BTC or 100000 satoshis. Still the 10% of all the "blood" in the system, but you can sell them in (100 times) more, smaller, cheaper pieces. For those newcomers who could not afford even 1 satoshi before the decimals change, now a stoshi is 100x cheaper, but you also have 100x more!

Yes, no new blocks doesn't mean the blockchain would collapse. Only it would remain static and not include new transactions, but the coins would still be there.
Also, if a 10% hashing power remains, it would still be blocks generated, only at about 1/10th of the intended rate (aprox. each 100 minutes).
The big issue is if the hash rate is even lower, and lower. 1% remaining would mean 1000 minutes per block, 0.1% 10000 minutes, and so on.
Also if there's no good enough network conectivity between all the remaining miners, several parallel blockchains would be mined, and once they restore connection only the longest one would be valid. The other blockchains would be dropped and therefore their miners' rewards lost.
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:08:28
Yes, there are currently several companies trying to get approval from the regulatory authorities (SEC) to launch Funds / ETFs based on bitcoins.
Recent news: 
This ETF in particular would be backed by an actual amount of bitcoins, so investors buying shares of the ETF would be buying -almost directly - the equivalent bitcoin counterpart.
That would mean fresh fiat money from Wall Street flowing directly into bitcoin value.
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:07:24
And that's because...
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:37:20
Right, but the currency that flows within that payment system, the units that are transferred carrying the value from one peer to another, are called BITCOINS. Or satoshis, if you prefer.
That's the BLOOD inside the bitcoin system, and there's only 21 million units of that blood. There will never be more.
So, if in the end the payment system succeeds, and it's broadly used to carry high amounts of wealth, the limited amount of blood will need to have a much higher intrinsic value.
TL/DR: You can't use a payment system to transfer 1 million dollars if all the circulating units within that system are only worth 999,999 dollars. Wait until Bitcoin network is used to transfer billions, and see what the price of each bitcoin should be then.
