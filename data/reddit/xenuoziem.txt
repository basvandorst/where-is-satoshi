Lol I see where your coming from. It's just some days I don't want all of the bad opinions and memes on here, so I just go to that forum for news and such. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:39
This is terrible. They overcharge by like 1k per coin. Your best bet Is to either find a legit seller that won't up charge you, or get your parents evolved.
