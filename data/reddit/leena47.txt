For sure, there's a lot to learn, and crypto is a new market. 
Any suggestions on educative resources ?

If its stolen, from lets say, logging into an account and transferring them elsewhere. Then yea, you can see which wallet it went to. 
If say, I sent it to a non existing wallet, well that would suck cause it wouldn't exist anyone. And they'd be out of circulation. 
Does that make sense ?

What about (and I'm just writing this to understand your perspective more), Litecoin, Neo, Poa Networks. These projects sound like great opportunities once developed and implemented on a larger scale. 
What do you think would be intelligent, useful and practical in the crypto world ?

Thank you for your in depth response. Indeed, it's about the community and technology as a whole. I get a feeling the USD value won't matter if/when BTC reaches it's critical mass. 
It's great to hear you're running a full node and purchasing BTC and sharing the information. And also, helping out on reddit :) 
I will be looking into computer science and the things you are doing as well. 
Thank you, friend.
