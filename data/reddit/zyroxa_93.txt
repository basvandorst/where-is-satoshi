what makes a currency "strong"? 
i think the swiss franc is way stronger than anything else :)
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:48:32
wat \^\^
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:17:04
do some research about hardware wallets and buy the one you'd like the most.
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:33:08
that sounds very legit. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:17:47
they have to get "new" bitcoins to pay :) i don't think that this will cause a dump lol \^\^
@_date: 2019-11-13 11:33:51
pretty sure you can use binance without KYC and still withdraw 1 btc per day. not 100% sure though...
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:00:35
you seem to be a very lazy dude... nobody is forcing you to invest in bitcoin. do your own research or don't, but asking people to convince you to invest is just a dumb thing really...
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:13:19
That would be really sick if thats going to happen!
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:25:45
I am proud to be a swiss! 
Hopefully we get more adoption in Bern soon :)
@_date: 2019-08-30 21:33:46
doesnt launch it at the 6th?
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:16:51
i live in switzerland aswell and i know that. but we still aint native speakers.
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:20:15
ye like paying the taxes with BTC like you already can do in Zug. 
or paying any bills with it.
@_date: 2019-10-13 12:54:04
Hey dude that's a really awesome idea! I'd love to know how you did that step by step and build one myself :)
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:39:44
there are 4 :) german, french, italian and romansh.
but normaly in zurich most of the ads are in german (excpect at the airport).
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:12:57
keep it as a backup hw wallet.
im sure you can't sell it. atleast i never would buy a hw wallet from a random dude over the internet \^\^
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:54:32
why is this ad in english? i mean if you are new in this tech, it can be really hard if you arent a native english speaker.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:36:15
It's time for a ₿lan!
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:16:44
10000 pizzas for bitcoin as comment for 2019 :)
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:28:42
wouldnt use my smartphone as cryptowallet... 
get a nano ledger or trezor :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:20:53
Sure could be but i guess even that would be a step forward to global adoption.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:49:59
its already old news.
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:43:17
nah most people doesnt even know that romansh exist :D
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:47:42
so true, that's why i never buy a single apple product :)
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:00:01
i think it doesnt matter what he is. the only thing which matters here is, he's right!
now you can use your own brain and think about a solution to protect you against that shit.
my opinion : bitcoin
whats yours?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:17:40
no :)
