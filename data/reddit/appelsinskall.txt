Christ, and you just believed these obvious scammers?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:42:38
I can help you with that!
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:54
Aw damn. You should have been earlier.

Bitcoin transfer. From one address to another. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:14:31
Yup. Annoying as it is 14hrs ago.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:10:48
6+. My account has been credited but not the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:27:29
I sent it yesterday. It says it is completed but nothing in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:22:50
True. Go 10x leverage on full bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:26:57
Coinbase, very quick to verify, but has limits of $500 at the start.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:56:49
In very long term could BCH could grow as an alternative, supposing anything bad happens to BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:15:17
Buy high never sell.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:46:02
Good question. You don't think Bittrex is going to have a plan to exchange it?
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:46:09
Only go full bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:05:10
Hodlers gonna hodl. Seriously tho, why would anyone sell?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:21:30
Can you summarize these reasons?
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:14:08
2BTC is really good what are you talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:13:23
Hope so. Cheap coins :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:22:50
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:09:53
Yeah. It is also how bubbles are created, when nobody wants to sell because it will rise steadily.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:30:06
Noob here. Should I sell BCH as fast as possible?
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:42:34
Just like people buy gold in uncertain times.
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:50:50
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:33:05
Proof on history repeating itself? Why Monday?
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:39:59
How did you do it?
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:25:14
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:52:31
how much?
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:58:27
in USD
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:59:41
What kind of wallet/way to store should I get?
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:14:43
Have gotten them pretty rich so far.
