I'll donate but will use the address on the coinpunk site, just in case the OP is not coinpunk ;-)
Some issues I have with Coinpunk:
* The icon that the wallet creates when you make a home screen icon (or whatever you call that) on an iPhone or iPad looks weird.
* To create an account on an iPhone the text fields don't fit the screen.
* You have to log in every time you wanna use it, that's not safe in a shop with HD security cams.
Can't you make an app that only does the login for the coinpunk wallet? They (Apple) can't refuse that I guess.
For the rest I love it, great work.

Wait for the blockchain.app update next week and then decide.

Buy a Trezor or use a HD wallet.

The Blockchain wallet app on my iPhone has a fixed .005 btc transaction fee. Way too high with bitcoin about 800$. That's because it has not been updated since 2012 I  guess. 
That's why I use the Coinpunk wallet right now.

I think the bitcoin protocol should be as lean as possible. Anonymity can be arranged client-side. Use a wallet program like Armory that avoids using the same addresses.

Just a wild guess after seeing this announcement

The only thing he didn't lost is weight.

The Blockchain app works fine for me on my iPhone. Also have ZeroBlock and several other btc-apps installed. What's the problem?
