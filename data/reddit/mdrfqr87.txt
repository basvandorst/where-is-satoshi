[Muscular Dystrophy Canada]( - It's the key research group dedicated to muscular dystrophy, which is a disease that weakens the muscles and results in kids being put into wheelchairs by age 10 and death in the 30s. 
Alternatively, my good friend with muscular dystrophy helped start up
[Ottawa Power Wheelchair Hockey League]( which gives those in wheelchair (muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, etc) a sport to play.  The organization is involved nationally, which means transporting those in wheelchairs from city to city gets pricy.

If it's +1, and -1, and thinking in pairs.... I think there is a defined circle to be made (or is already made) and either inside or outside of the circle, the BIP words must be the wallet.  
What is the order? I think if they are put in order they appear in the paper, the actual password is one from the front, and one from the back, and so on and so forth.  Is there a way to confirm the order number of specific words for 'code' 'easily' 'attack' 'early' 'almost' and 'open'?  They might be grouped in perfect order.

At Best Buy - the cash will be recorded through the register, and deposited into the bank account that we know of. We will then audit that bank account through confirmations and testing.
We know we have all the bank accounts by sending a confirmation to the bank accounts they deal with.
Bitcoin? I need some assurance to ensure I'm obtaining information on THEIR bank account.
Assuming we can assign a single bitcoin address to a company - it is possible, but the discussion about added anonymity would cause more problems.
I'm not saying it's not possible for a company to do this - but it would hinder large corporations from obtaining the unqualified opinion they want.

Never said it wasn't useful for smaller corporations. But those public companies would never get their proper unqualified opinion on their statements given this issue, and therefore investors will bail.

See my response above. Cash is tracked through bank accoutns which are 100% tied against a corporation.

So you've raised a good point, which goes against all what Iv'e said, but it is extremely hard and rare for a corporation to deal with a seperate bank without having any trace. 
Once you start dealing with a single bank, the documentation and ability to confirm all activities with the bank is simple. 
But you need to put it in the perspective of the auditor where we need to be able to somehow gain comfort that we're being provided all the accounts and that they include all transactions.

As an auditor, you will never gain acceptance of bitcoin in the general mass commercial businesses if this cannot be properly tracked.  
All major companies WILL want to adhere to the government guidelines and being able to be audited.  If pure anonymity exists, this exposes companies to being further investigated.  
Having full anonymity will cause problems that will scare away companies as they will see this as a risk to dealing with the government.
As much as this currency helps promote the control of government, in the end, government still exists, laws are still in place, and large corporations will always follow them. 
I'm currently working on a report to explain how bitcoin can be audited for corporations wanting to make the shift.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:12:29
This is close to where I was going.  It doesn't matter who gave you it, or what they did with the money before. It's the fact that they obtained the $100.
I 100% understand you can view the transactions in the public ledger, but being able to fully get assurance that I'm looking at the ALL the company's bitcoin wallets, is another issue. 
If you look at not-for-profit financial statements, the audit report will always qualify the fact that they can never assure that all cash transactions were properly recorded. 
If I send a bank confirmatino to a bank, I can assure that I'm receiving all the information of that specific client. Who do I send a confirmation for Bitcoin? Who can assure me the company is showing me all their wallets?
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:21:22
I think you need to understand how cash can be tracked for audit purposes versus bitcoin.
For cash, businesses will supposedly transact, deposit and withdraw from a bank account.  It is 100% possible for cash to be taken off premises or services provided without any sort of cash being deposited in the business, but we gain comfort during our audit as we can do bank confirmations on the balance and reconcile the work performed to the cash balance.
When it comes to bitcoin - the issue is confirming what the balance was at a certain date.  Yes I agree 100% that it is a public ledger and you can access the account and see the transactions and count backwards to the date you prefer, but there is no real assurance that this is the account and sole account used by the corporation. 
In that case, as an auditor, I have absolutely no assurance that I'm including all transactions. I have no assurance that this is 100% of the cash they have, and therefore I would never sign off on an audit report. 
Trust me - as much as everyone wants to have less government involvement... it will always be there. Getting unqualified audit reports is a must to have large corporations moving forward - especially if they are public.  
The more anonymity that exists with a corporations account, the less investors want to deal with that corporation and the more it will push corporations away from dealing with it.
Currently - bitcoin has multiple wallets and no real method to determine th

I was a Big 4 auditor for 5+ years, aswell (as of last week), and this was something I brought up to the partners to consider doing a paper on. 
Given my departure, I never got around to doing it - but I did think of the complications.
This was one aspect I wanted to push since large corpoations, no matter how tech savvy they are, need to get an unqualified opinion on their audited statements.  If you throw in bitcoins into the equation, as an auditor, I'd say "yah - forget it. We can't feasibly audit this". Thereby making companies sway away from it more for an investors relation point of view. 
Rights &amp; Obligation / Completeness - Are they reporting all the accounts you have? It's not easy to ensure you have all their accounts.  But ultimately I was thinking that if the revenues are recorded through a single account for bitcoin transactions, you can sample those and ensure the transactions occurred through the wallets that are reported to you.
I think one the wallets are known, the issue of transactions shouldn't be a major issue.  Not that it isn't - but it's like having a mess in front of you. You know it's there - but its just a matter of figuring out how to organize and efficiently audit it.  
I'm also working with a Bitcoin ATM machine company to ensure their machines allow for companies to account for the transactions properly by providing the relevant information. 
As a way to confirm ownership, you could ask them to send you 0.000000001 BTCs with a certain message.  It could be their cost of a 'confirmation'. 
I'd be happy to discuss more. PM me.

Nope, not at all, and that doesn't matter to the corporation or the government.

Search up "Bitcoin Register" in Google Play. My friend is still designing it - but it's a fair start.  You can also do credit card and cash transactions in it as well. 
Took me 5 minutes and I had a merchant account and was able to scan people's credit cards right off my cellphone with the tap feature. Blew their minds away.
Plan is to update the name to Coinbox.

If you're willing to risk a few cents, you can sign up a merchant account when you go "pay by credit card" and take the 5minutes to type in your info.  You can then charge people by credit card right off your phone.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:48:52
So first off, the app allows for credit card payments (seperate from Bitcoin payments). My friend put it in the app in order to show that paying with Bitcoins provides a discount.
That video shows the ease of scanning a card.  You can literaly scan a card and the details will show up.  Within the app, after you confirm the receipt amount, it will load the NFC technology and ask you to wave the credit card against the phone.  Once you do - the payment will be transacted.
This is through "Stripe" (   It took me 2 minutes to make an account (put in name, address, SIN, and bank info).  It then takes 2.8% + 35cents of each transaction. Then, 7 days from the transaction, you'll see the money in your account.
This is to purchase the product the merchant is selling.  This is separate from paying with Bitcoins.
EDIT: This feature is available on most smartphones.  If you have a Samsung S4 like I do, it is the NCF button, which would enable the credit card feature.

It appears to be free now.  I think he just wants to get people aware of the product first and gain some feedback.
