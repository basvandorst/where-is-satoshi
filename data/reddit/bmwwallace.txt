�� have you tried taking the C out of cheese and adding to + signs after, learning that and then contributing to bitcoin core? That might help? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:30:29
I would say C++, as it is the least memory intensive, which is good when scaling is the main issue! �� and check out the original bitcoin code as well for reference! And always remember it takes time, so don't get too overwhelmed at the start and just take it a byte at a time

What are you talking about?! What prosperity? We are living in a time where the gap between rich and poor has never been so vast!? Since Nixon decided to no longer use the gold standard the federal reserve have been able to print as much money as they want, crerating compound interest that goes on for miles and miles without anybody being able to reign them in! Inflation is just not a good idea! You have to earn more now than you did 10 years ago, but wages do not increase by the same amounts!

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:55
I don't think that is the point of the ICIJ?! What they are trying to do is highlight the corruption that some of the biggest organisations in the world are complicit in. Currently banks, corporations and wealthy individuals can hide their wealth offshore in order to avoid tax that is due. That money could actually be spent where it is needed! Wealth inequality is a growing problem and this organisation is trying to highlight that very fact! I'm not saying that people don't have a right to privacy, but you can't honestly believe that it is ok for companies to avoid paying taxes that are due to the states or people that afford them the right to do business in a country?!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:29:26
How much is the dollar worth? It has nothing to prop it up, other than faith? It costs around 2k in electricity to create 1 bitcoin, so that is the minimum value of it

When determining what to pay for SegWit transactions, you need to know their virtual size, which is defined as their weight divided by 4.
The virtual size of a non-SegWit transaction is equal to its normal size. The virtual size of a SegWit transaction is always lower than its conventional size.
Feerates (when expressed in satoshi per byte) apply directly to the virtual size. For example, at 40 sat/byte you would pay 10000 sat for a 250 byte transaction. But a 250 byte SegWit transaction may have only 600 weight (= 150 vbytes), and so would only pay 6000 sat at 40 sat/byte.
In short, you need to know the weight or virtual size of SegWit transactions. Their conventional byte size is mostly irrelevant

No, theft occurs when a corporation has roads built, infrastructure supplied, incentives granted yet refuses to contribute to the state that has supplied them with the means to produce their product/service. Progressive taxation is there to help people who have not had the same opportunities as others or to cover the costs of universal healthcare. It's there to build roads for communities, maintain water and sanitation systems. If people decide to hoard wealth, to help only themselves, then we remain in a perpetual cycle where nobody wins?! I have no problem with people being wealthy, but contribute to the society that has helped make that wealth possible! "A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in"

Economics can be seperated into two different schools of thought, the keynsian and the austrian models. The current system, which is keynsian, is based on the idea ythat inflation is a good thing. Some see this as a silent robbery by the banks, as each dollar they create devalues yours fractionally. The Austrian model promotes deflation, where there is a fixed supply (eg. 21 million bitcoin) and that they can only go up in value as the amount that are in circulation levels out. What bitcoin tries to address is this very issue, it creates a system of wealth whereby you control your own money and there is no third party that can affect your currency via quantitative easing or other means.

Well I'm unsure of the regulations in the US, but there are so many ways to game the system and move money around anonymously that I don't think it matters where you are in the world! what you could do is get a cryptopay card and just use that to spend money without making the IRS too aware? Like just spend it on groceries and simple stuff. That way you could be saving your own funds and never have to worry about getting caught

Well perosnally I'm not here to make money, infact that is the last thing on my mind! I'm here because this is a new way of regulating your own cashflow without the need for banks and or governments crippling your personal wealth with hyperinflation. Everyone seems to be thinking "I'm going to be a millionaire", and maybe you will?! But a million euro/dollar/yuan is irrelevant when everyone is spending bitcoin/litecoin etc. This is more than money, this is an act of rebellion

You remember the 2008 finanical collapse right? Do you think thats the sign of a healthy market? Do you think we are supposed to have recession? No, the reason we do, the reason that quantitative easing occurs is because of the banks. And FIAT currency has not done a good job, people hyave, technology has! Economics is not what keeps people alive, cures disease or figures out how particles collide, people do! If we did not have to worry about capitalism we wopul;d be better off, we would be free!

I understand exactly what you mean, and its a pyramid until it isnt. Look at the federal reserve or the ECB, they are essentially ideas we buy into in the hope that its not a pyramid scheme but it is. The difference is, bitcoin levels the playing field! It feels like a pyramid scheme based on the shit we have already. But this is new! Let it grow and see, at least there is no central authority

Well maybe my view is slightly different being european and irish. But recessions happen for a reason and they continue to happen because the system is broken! We have had 6 major european recessions in the last 7 years including the european sovereign debr crisis, the greek governemnt crisis, portuguese financial crisis... I could go on... but my point is that these are recurrent! Look I'm not saying that bitcoin is the answer, but its a start, its a change! If we refuse to try to get better as a society then what is the point in anything? If the world says no, then fine, but if there is consensus then embrace it, adapt, learn and maybe you will see it differently! Or maybe the real reward of bitcoin is the friends we made along the way ��

Hi all, so with the leak of the paradise papers and the subsequent fallout, I decided to reach out to the ICIJ and asked them if they would consider bitcoin as payment for donations. If we are to destroy this current keynsian economic system, we must encourage the use of alternative currencies by the vanguards of our democray and freedom, the journalists and investigators, that break the stories. So reach out to any that you know and ask them if they accept bitcoin, ask them if they will choose to be on the side that refuses to give up and ask them if they will continue to stand for what is right.

Its definitely not great but they have their own interpretation of what bitcoin should be and do not work together! The other 50% are various groups and indiviluals so its fine! Its still in its infancy! Give it time
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:09:18
Less that 10% is held by wallet owners? All bitcoin has to be in a wallet? And 1 wallet does not mean 1 owner or even a person at all? 
When you say most mining is done by 3 or 4 operations thats incorrect, and also that does imply decentralization! If it was centralized it would be 1 company!
Decentralization comes from the fact that it is not controlled by 1 entity and is in the hands of developers and the communtity. The second it becomes centralized it becomes redundant
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:56:52
Centralisation is the problem! You are uallowing some entity to control your money, and thus have you by the balls! Banks guarantee your money up to 100k anything over that they will not reimburse! If you are not responsible enough to own bitcoin and be your own bank, stay out of crypto kid!
