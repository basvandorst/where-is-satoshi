That's good to know ��

This is such an important point. There is no single definition. Just like you can't say a smart phone is primarily only used for photos. There are so many other uses GPS, MP3 player, dictation, email...  Bitcoin is the same, it can be used for currency, as saving, as notarisation, for multi sig banking, secure messaging etcetc.

Did you even listen to what cosmicboombix said? A cowboy let's just do it cos it looks right is a recipe for failure. Anyone with a little experience in development knows this.

Q1. Wrong. Yes it does. Drop supply. Price increases. 
Q2. If you want liberal currency availability then you're welcome to move to Argentina. Or if you're into cyber currency then go to r/ethereum. 
Q3. Bitcoin functions using cryptography, hashing, decentralisation and progressively declining seigniorage. Economies are enriched though the creation of desirable goods and services. Sound stores of value and efficient means of transfer enable economies to function. Anti libertarians like you would love for the hundreds of cryptocurrenies be shut down for the greater good. Having a market and choice of currencies should be everyone's right.

ETP (Ether Proof of Stake) and ETHC (Ether Capped Supply). Not to confused for ETCP (Ether Classic Proof of Stake) and ETCC (Ether Classic Capped Supply)

:) I'm agreeing with you. We're both stating the obvious

Wrong, any Hard Fork is an abomination. It says you can destroy the old and replace it with the new at any moment. It is the antithesis of immutability. Immutable persistence is the essence of power.

Yes. On the yahoo finance website BTCEUR works but in the iOS stocks app it doesn't

I've done some research and it shows that the total money supply over the last four decades has done that.

According to HMRC Bitcoin donations would qualify "Donations can be made in sterling or any foreign currency. When calculating claims the charity must convert foreign currency into sterling at the rate on the date when the donation was made."

You are joining together different problems. A spend from a wallet that contains nothing can not be broadcast. 0+0=0. It's meaningless. Secondly transactions always occur instantaneously (you should have a go with sending Bitcoin to somebody you are sitting next to, then you will see that the transaction occurs within seconds after sending). The double spend problem is the problem that somebody who has funds sends that money to 2 different people almost simultaneously. Whilst it is technically possible to do it is difficult and it is fraud so illegal. In retail environments customers identities are public (captured on CCTV) and so it would be an idiot that would attempt such a crime in a retail scenario. Additional this potential exploit has seen zero actual uses in the wild. The reality is that after seven confirmations the double spend problem is absolutely solved.

Good, it's so nice to hear feedback. When viewed on a computer there is a small explanation when you hover over each of the images. In the physical book there is the contents. You are right though, it is nice to have some explanation for complete beginners, I guess that is where the person showing it / giving it to them would come in.

Awesome points

Good points. There is also an aspect of liberty, we ought to have the freedom to choose...
Do you really think it would be bad if bitcoin was fully adopted i.e. replacing a national currency? Why is that??
@_date: 2016-10-05 19:27:55
That's awesome

That has already been done in Bitcoin2.0 aka Litecoin
@_date: 2016-10-05 09:10:45
Thanks, will do. It's amazing how much work goes into conveying a simple idea

It's not my conclusion, it is a perception that some people have. A ponzi is a scheme that benefits initial investors at the expense of final investors who lose out in an eventual collapse. This is in regards Fiat to bitcoin exchange price. The suggestion is that the first people to buy in will benefit on the basis of subsequent people buying in at a higher price. You could see an example of this for anyone who bought bitcoin when it was $1000.

Interesting. I wonder if other countries have similar gift aid tax schemes....

No. As you well know Litecoin is built using an upgraded Bitcoin blockchain called Segwit. It has an operational Litecoin Lightning network that relieves on chain transactions. Given time there will be more and more companies like Yours.org using it because it's more efficient. Litecoin lightning redefines what is possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:20:03
Litecoin because it has 8x the cap and Lightning. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:45:49
15000tx+ and growing

If it's on mainnet then it's live. However before customer facing services go live the security must be tested. Right now there is an open Litecoin Lightning payment channel with $1Million sitting in it. 
Gradual development with thorough security testing is the proper approach for Litecoin. Afterall look at Ethereum's DAO experience. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:16:38
All major Litecoin exchanges and wallets use 6 confirmations. If you're in possession of some improved understanding than a $1.5 billion industry do share. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:26:31
You can say 'nonsense', '0 people using it' and 'it's a test' all you like. Facts are facts. 
"Christian Decker of Blockstream made the first full, secure Lightning payment on a non-test network." 
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:30:56
Litecoin is 4x faster and has segwit giving an effective blocksize of 2MB. 4x2 = 8.... 8x the capacity
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:23:16
Litecoin has working Lightning on chain right now. Segwit is the key technology difference that allows Litecoin Lightning to work. It is a fundamental rearrangement in the way transactions are ordered and means that Litecoin has extended capabilities compared to Bitcoin. From the article ".. SegWit. For example, the Lightning Network, which could boost litecoin transactions by as much as a million times". 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:36:32
On Litecoin all blocks are Segregated Witness. If you mean Litecoin Lightning transactions then all of those are off-chain, so aren't included. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:12:07
On Litecoin it takes 2.5 minutes to get a confirmation. On Bitcoin it is 10 minutes. For a user it is 4x faster to carry out a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:57:07
Nonsense?!? Explain yourself. Litecoin Lightning scales to millions of tx/s ... 
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:46:29
Technically they are different because Litecoin implemented Segwit. Also Litecoin uses the skrypt hashing algo which gives it a x1000 security boost. Security wise Litecoin also has the malleability problem fixed (mtgox and similar hacks can not happen again on Litecoin).
