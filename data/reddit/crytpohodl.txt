BTC will bounce back because as of right now,  BTC is the gateway of crypto currencies. All exchanges right now carry BTC.  Younger alt currencies are getting press as to their sudden rise at the beginning.  After the glitter has settled,  people will move toward steadier investments,  which will be the more established cryptos. People will come back to BTC to invest or cash out.

Thank you for sharing your story. I think playing in crypto-currencies is like gambling.  It is addictive, seeing that value go up,  always being on the winning team. I just started in December 2017, and I have been fortunate to be warned by good people like you about the dangers of not securing crypto currencies in a hard wallet.
I'm sorry for your loss. Your brother's story will serve as a good reminder that securing crypto currency is not a waste on time or money.

Coinbase.com right now has more users than stock brokerage Schwab.  It's only a matter of time.

I see the sense in that.  I don't like that other networks are on top of Bitcoin to support it. That is exactly what Nakamoto wanted to avoid,  third party involvement.
I think Litecoin right now is the best positioned to take it over. Bitcoin is the Napster of crypto,  but something will come along to claim the throne. I don't know which one it is though.

Automation makes this possible. I will give it to you that it won't happen instantly,  but it does happen.
Imagine this...  An onsite news broadcasting team use to have a communication truck, video crew, and reporter on the scene of an event. People now are doing the same thing on their smart phones and posting online.
Already, we see pictures and video used from smart phones in the newspaper and on TV. Automation totally devalued what the crews were doing for decades.
