Lol, no one said so. But you compliained about scaling yourself.

I am curious - how does these ATM's work?! :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:35:46
The last one shows how many USD there is in circulation - the crisis is whats up with the last graph ;) 
"heey, our money aint worth shit, lets make even more money so they are less worth"
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:13:21
Yes he can! But since ASIC it have become like mining for gold, in a mountain of granite, using a spoon. Still supports the security of the network though - but if that is what he want, he should properly hos a note instead - so Freakyfancy, do not listen to what i just said, you actually "can't" mine as Allyougottado said ;)

Ohh, damn xD Aaand we just became a company xD
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:14:29
Then please enlighten us, who is this CEO?
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:06:54
True true, it is all the paper money in circulation, the M1 supply, but it is still an extreme jump, that shouldn't have happened (at-least in my opinion).

Also there is more and more sites, that offer jobs for BTCs. Depending on your skills you could go check out [:)

as already have pointed out, the rules to which you are referring, are not so much rules as they are benefits, up till some point.
And using the word "unbreakable" is just plain, well wrong?!

Thanks man! I am still kinda new to reddit - and i where also thinking "why is my link looking like that. hmm, nahh it is properly just on my screen so that i can see the link, and if i have made a typo that needs fixing"
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:47:55
Ohhm, any good options for the onlooker, who just like to keep an eye on things, which i used block chain to before this :s

Care to enlighten me?!

And then when he comes out, there is a chance (although small) that those 70 btc is worth, fuck all. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:38:28
Okay, we can probably all agree that most fiat currencies is about to crash. 
But will it help having BTC then? 
I mean, if a fiat crash occurs wouldn't kill most of the trust in a "monetary based economy"? Wouldn't be better to have possessions if that occurred?

And you must not understand The real options in crypto too be this ignorant.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:05:06
So all you see is money. Lul
@_date: 2017-05-01 10:30:27
Okay, so - no, i dont know how big or small the chance is, all i was trying to point out is that, there is a chance. 
No, i do not think the post is real, but lets use your own logic "You don't know if it is fake or not" &lt;- if im wrong, plz prove me wrong. 
Damn kid?! 
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:17:16
No you came with a statement, you have proved nothing. 
And i choose small due to my own beliefs in the system, as well as me believing that a 51 percent attack is unlikely.  Happy?
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:00:05
I  know it is a very slim chance, but theft off around 500.000 usd would give what? 3 years? 
There can happen a lot in three years, there is always the off chance that some Chinese farmer makes a 51 percent attack (Or even government?!) and the trust in the community is lost. -All i am saying is (even without that chance) i would not risk a friendship over that, fuck money - they dont make you happy (Only help a lot)
