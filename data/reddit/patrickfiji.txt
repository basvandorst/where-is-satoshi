We broke past a huge 14k sell wall 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:23:45
Generally, depending on your local btc atm rules, you can buy less than 1000 without identity per day. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:04:45
Check if there are any bitcoin atms in your area. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:26:42
Is this an app?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:21:28
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:49:05
Transactions are irreversible. Pretty sure it’s lost. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:10:48
yep. be wary of the fees and rates on these atms, though. the ones in my area charge $2500 usd over the current btc price plus transaction fees.

Sell walls
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:32:24
Fuck this. I’m out
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:45:08
are you trying to verify your bank account? if so, they put a small charge (takes about 2 days) on your bank account so that you can prove you have access/are the owner to the linked bank account. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:30:21
not sure which sites you're on but there is no age restriction. only thing that can hold a minor back is financial resources (bank, credit card, etc.)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:20:44
disable the internet
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:42:01

@_date: 2017-12-30 02:40:26
I’ve been waiting almost two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:50:11
I keep a small amount of BTC on CB and can sell whenever. The funds go straight to my bank acc. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:53:35
Bitcoin atms
Edit: nevermind. I can’t read 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:54
it's called sell walls
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:42:40
I’ve exhausted most of them. Still waiting for verification 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:08:42
link bank account and sell your balance through there on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:04:46
I have a wallet on blockchain. i have keys and everything set up there. can i send all my btc there and will it be safely secured?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:56:51
this has to be a troll
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:29:40
What’s significant about wednesday 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:36:54
Also since (I’m assuming his his age) OP doesn’t have any stable income, would OP fall into the lowest tax bracket which would result in incredibly small taxes if any? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:45:53
I’m not verified on coinbase but still have the option to withdraw funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:57:25

Reading this in a Gordon Ramsey accent makes it 10x better. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:55
Depending on the size of the transaction, it usually takes more than an hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:30:50
ive been waiting 11 days.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:57:52

@_date: 2017-12-25 23:57:16
Pm me. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:08:18
bitcoin is a currency, not a stock within an index 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:42:49
