It would be easy to see if a site lets you short real bitcoins or naked. Take Bitfinex. They let you short the bitcoins. That site also lets you lend out your bitcoins to shorts at interest. It's pretty apparent that the shorts coming from there (and a majority of them are sold at Bitstamp) are done with real bitcoins which are borrowed from people who are paid interest. If a site pops up and lets you short the bitcoins without there being any clear indication as to where these supposed bitcoins come from.. then there is something odd going on.

There is a reason why a lot of corporations, and I am not talking about BTC here, flat out refuses to deal with US citizens. I use a bank called Skandiabanken. Is a traditional fiat bank which operates in Scandinavia. They flat out refuse to deal with both US citizens and _also_ refuse to deal with anyone who has residency there. This actually causes problems for students and others who want to live in the US for a few years, they can no longer have bank accounts in their home country if they declare a new address in the US.

We should take what SarahCoinBit and ne0futur (William Waisse) say on IRC right now with a very big grain of salt. I asked Waisse if he had actually talked to Mark. He first refused to answer but when I pushed him he got very upset and eventually admitted that no, he had not. It's not likely that any of these remote MtGox "support" people have had any contact with MtGox since before the weekend. And as said, they get very angry when you push them on this.

No massive dump will come from this transaction. It's Mark/MtGox moving coins that have been untouched since 2011. It will be up to the trustee handling their bankruptcy how these coins will be handled / distributed.

This is entirely correct. I am a true believer and I decided to GTFO at the first sign of withdraw delays. And I see the collapse of MtGox as a very good thing, now we can finally move on better times and this collapse will also demand higher standards of exchanges in the future. Those who lost funds have learned to be more careful. Some may even have learned that if you do not have the private keys to a Bitcoin then you have no Bitcoin, you have an IOU for a Bitcoin from someone who may or may not have it.

Reminder: MtGox themselves seriously claimed that they also "discovered" that half the fiat was "missing" on February 24th, 2014. Their story is that they had NO IDEA that half the fiat was missing prior to this date. It is interesting to note that fiat withdraw delays from emptygox begun May/June 2013. Millions of USD do not magically disappear overnight. And yes, it's not far-fetched to suspect that MtGox themselves sold the entire orderbook with imaginary BTC when they realized that their ponzi game was up in order to reduce the fiat debt on their books. Their bankruptcy filing DOES NOT include the owed BTC as a liability.

One thing you should make very clear in your articles about that case is that Florida has a law which says you must be a MSB to do cash/BTC transactions above $300 per year. I know other states in your fascist dictatorship with an illusion of freedom has similar laws. People should be very aware of this because it means that they can basically arrest anyone just for buying or selling a single Bitcoin with cash. This is utterly insane but that's what you get when you sit idly by and let your leaders get away with false-flag mass murder like 9/11. The case itself is ridiculous, it's like me selling my car to someone and being charged with "money laundering" because I accept a cash payment. This $300/year limit and other relevant laws should be made very clear in your articles - a lot of people risk going to jail for no apparent reason because they don't realize how far and how fast your "free and democratic" country has fallen.

You can use an old computer with something like JAuth or other PC implementation or a non-google android implementation. Google has one implementation but there are many others. There is no reason to use the Google one. There is, however, very good reasons NOT to use your normal bring-with-you-everywhere phone for 2FA. Using an old laptop or desktop computer or old phone or a $50 android phone from the local supermarket is better.

The official client doesn't even let you choose what port to use from the GUI. It's not add that a lot fewer bitcoin-qt's are reachable compared to ANY other sane piece of P2P software. 
It's also a problem that Armory breaks if your bitcoind is configured to use either port= or connect= which means it's better to have it firewalled.
ofc if you are the only one on your lan and you control the firewall then perhaps you can forward 8333. That's usually not the case.
It's also not possible to set bandwidth limits for bitcoin-qt (unlike all other sane P2P software). This makes running a node very unattractive. Allowing something to use 5% or 10% of your bandwidth is one thing, allowing it to use 100% is something completely different.
In short, bitcoin-qt is garbage if you compare it with all other P2P software feature-wise. The sad thing is that the developers give me the distinct impression that this is by design and their choosing - not because it wouldn't be very easy to fix.

Let's say you know you're about to declare bankruptcy.
You're MtGox so you go into your little SQL database and enter a huge sum in the "BTC_Balance" field of your self-trade account and you sell the entire orderbook down to $250. Now everyone with fiat thinks the coins are too cheap to resist and buys your non-existent "coin".
MtGox now owns most of the fiat and all the customer claims are for BTC - which may not be easy to enforce in a court.
I know this is far-fetched and pure speculation and I don't see it as too likely myself but I wouldn't put this passed them. I guess this is the sort of thing that comes to mind easier if you've assumed MtGox has been self-trading with "unlimited" funds all along. Interesting side-note: It came out that Bitcoinica did this after they closed up and it turns out that they were trading at a net loss even though they had a magic account with "unlimited" funds.
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:37:37
All coins are equal of the currency is completely worthless. "coin validation" would make it possible for some authority so say that the money you have in your wallet is no good anymore. It is a slippery slope once you start doing that. First it's "stolen coins" then it's "coins from drug sales" and then it's "you wrote an article about NATO false flag terror operations and we don't like that so you're not allowed to have digital money". Bitcoin is dead the moment coin validation is introduced and a large amount of people will immediately switch to one of the many alternative altcoins out there.
If you like coin validation then you might as well go for a traditional bank account with fiat in it, that way a central authority can already close your bank account for any random reason as it sees fit.

ThePiachu, there is something called "common sense". You may want to try to get hold of some.

Some points.
Those of us who understand how Bitcoin works immediately understand that the story as presented by SR2 was cute but completely unrealistic.
5 of the SR2.0 admins were arrested late December but the site magically remained up.
Many of us have suspected that the site has been a honeypot since that point in time.
The real figure of coins gone missing from SR2 was probably closer to 88k. We have no idea what the real number is, all we can say for sure is that the cute defcon story is hogwash and that we should put zero weight on his figure.
The SR2 "hack" just happened to come the day after the police took down Utopia, which was their biggest competitor.
There is no way to know for sure if SR2 was a US government black operation and they simply decided to take all the funds there (which was all drug money anyway) or it was run by some other group who decided to cash out and go  the day after Utopia was taken down. I view the first alternative as the far more likely one. I have a greater understanding as to how both Tor and Bitcoin works than most and see the SR2 story as ridiculous at best - but I do get why people who don't understand the technical details would believe their cute little story.

Here are the facts.
a) Roger Ver very publicly announced that he was buying up MtGoxBTC on bitcointalk. These buys were also something he announced in the press, see 
b) It's been said that the investors MtGox approached contacted both authorities and the Bitcoin foundation.
c) Remember that "joint statement" that came out from all the exchanges and services such as blockchain.info? Well, guess who is a major shareholder/owner over at blockchain.info. Hint: His initials are R V
d) BitcoinBuilder was up and running until well after MtGox had closed up (which I found odd).
Could it be that Roger Ver knew that MtGox was going to close on Tuesday and declare bankruptcy ahead of 
time? If that's not obvious to you then I have a bridge I would like to sell you (pm me for details). 
Roger Ver did in fact confirm (on IRC today) that all he lost at MtGox were coins tied up there through Bitcoinica. This is interesting that he very publicly confirmed that he was buying MtGoxBTC. I'm sure several people who sold MtGoxBTC to him can confirm this.
I do not know if any laws were actually broken here (ianal) but my personal opinion is that Roger Ver is a criminal and should be seen as such. At minimum it's fair to say that he traded of not publicly known information 
I'm sure Josh over at Bitcoinbuilder could confirm that Roger Ver did indeed use that service and I'm also positive he can confirm that Roger did some big trades there ahead of time. It could of course be worse than that, Roger and Mark "are friend" and Roger could simply have called Mark and said "send me them bitcoins".

I seriously doubt he will turn down that kind of money - which is clearly really needs - just because he has to meet the person who is going to hand him the money. As I understand it he's already aware that the community has been donating and he is probably looking forward to getting that money.

The DDOS did not happen until after the MtGox release. And this caused a minor "unspendable change" problem in the official implementation which some exchanges used.. and it took a whole 24 hours until a fix hit github.
Meanwhile, MtGox was issuing broken transactions and re-issuing withdraws based on transaction hash alone. That issue, the real issue at Mtgox - which has NOTHING to do with transaction malleability - is something that did not affect any other exchange (since no other exchange uses a badly PHP-implemented bitcoind).

People are so conditioned that they simply can't fathom the simple question: "Do we really need a foundation?". I like to point out that the foundation is just a big scam filled with people who are only working for their own self-interest. I believe this to be true. I also see it as plain obvious that the leaders of this foundation scam are blatantly doing what would qualify as illegal "insider trading" in all other markets. Laws vary from country to country. If you just look at what's actually been in mainstream press articles about this and the laws in the country I'm from then you'd clearly see that the foundation leaders would probably have been arrested long ago if they were operating in this country.
Does this mean that we need ANOTHER foundation? No. The simplest solution is to just ignore the foundation and NOT donate money to it. If more people become aware that it's just one big scam and people stop giving money (and even attention) to them then it'll just go away. And that would be a good thing. We do not need the Bitcoin foundation, nor do we need anything else to take it's place. Another "foundation" is neither required or desired.
The Bitcoin developers should get paid for making the software (at least those who do not have big bitcoin holdings already, those who do already have a big financial incentive for maintaining the software). We do not need a foundation to help fund them. A multi-signature donation wallet is more than enough for this purpose. A multi-signature wallet, not another foundation, is what I see as the best replacement for the "Bitcoin foundation".

One interesting question: If someone stole $500 million from you.. would you not perhaps go file a POLICE REPORT? My bike isn't worth nearly as much but I went to the trouble of filing one when that was stolen. It's interesting that no such police report has been filed by MtGox. I just find this a bit . . strange.

He had coins at *Bitcoinica* which that exchange (or rather the bankruptcy manager) had stuck at MtGox. He did NOT have control of these coins. There is a difference between having coins in YOUR account and having coins someone else owes you stuck at an exchange.

Their numbers are real but you can't really compare then directly. Any exchange with a 0% fee will have a minimum of 10x the volume of an exchange with fees. That does not mean their numbers are not real, it just means you can't compare the numbers  directly because they mean very different things.

I find this new amazing lawsuit story funny and ridiculous and I also find it funny that some people seem to be falling for this neatly packed stack of hogwash. Here are some facts one should consider when reading about this very recent lawsuit: a) It has not been possible to withdraw USD from MtGox normally since June 2013. b) There are numerous reports that MtGox processes USD withdraws at a 5% "emergency" extortion fee. Now, it's known that some get to withdraw using this option and some do not and the reasons why some get to do this and some do not are unclear, but it seems most people can get out at a 5% haircut. c) The BTC price at MtGox was +20-25% for months because people were buying overpriced BTC in order to GTFO from MtGox. The BTC price at MtGox is currently lower than it has been for many, many months and NOW all of a sudden we get this interesting timed "news" about a lawsuit which essentially encourages everyone to sell their BTC way under market value for mtgoxUSD. I'm not a lawyer but I do understand that it's just as easy to sue MtGox for BTC and there is no reason to choose mtgoxUSD over mtgoxBTC just because someone is spreading a bit of FUD. One should also remember that you can actually trade mtgoxBTC for realBTC at bitcoinbuilder and get out that way while you're essentially stuck if you choose mtgoxUSD.

My experience is that Hotmail isn't particularly better, a lot of legitimate things are blocked by them too. I have a site where a lot of blog spammers used to sign up with hotmail e-mails &amp; Hotmail "fixed" this to blocking e-mails from that site.

cycles or charts can tell you a whole lot of things..
but what if just 1 of the biggest BTC holders decides that "I've had it with this BTC thing, I'll just cash out in fiat and buy a small island and retire and live like a king the rest of my life"?
A market sell of 50000 BTC would take the Bitstamp price down to $1. The market cap for BTC is in theory a few billions but you can't actually get that. There's currently 14 million USD in the entire bid curve at Bitstamp (and probably twice that in accounts but not in the bid curve). That's all there is, that's it. Period. There are plenty of people who have enough BTC to take all of that fiat and it only takes ONE "early adopter" to do it. Something to think about.

MtGox fiat withdrawal problems have been known for half a year. This begs the simple question: Who in their right mind would transfer that many BTC into MtGox - and only MtGox - and sell like that knowing that they would not be able to get their fiat out? Would anyone in their right mind do that? Would anyone iwth 250,000 BTC do that? Would doing so be logical? You are not alone in thinking that MtGox would be better off holding all the fiat while all the customers hold claims on BTC if they were to declare bankruptcy. If I (or anyone) actually had that many BTC and wanted to sell them then it's pretty obvious that I would do it on multiple exchanges at once. And before you say "but you can't get BTC out of MtGox", yes, that's currently true - but their FIAT problems started many months ago.

People tip DOGE if they want to tip something because it's a currency that works for micropayments. BTC does not. This has to do with the fees, you can send $1 worth of DOGE to reddit and tip people but the fee structure of BTC means it would cost you $5 to send that $1 to reddit and tip people with BTC. If you don't like DOGE then you can always send it to an exchange and trade it for BTC - except that your entire tip will be eaten by BTCs fee when you withdraw that BTC. Just face it, DOGE is the tipping currency because it actually works for micropayments and people will use it on and everywhere else they want to tip people regardless of you liking that or not. If you don't like this then take it up with the Bitcoin miners and developers and try to get them to change fee structure so Bitcoin becomes competitive for micropayments.

Some further tips since I've read quite a lot of stories about people getting their Bitstamp account cleaned out:
- DO NOT use 2FA on the phone your are normally using. If you have a e-mail client with your e-mail password stored on your phone and you install the malware then the malware criminals have all they need to clear out your Bitstamp account
- Use a seperate phone or old computer for 2FA and only use the device for this purpose. Only connect this device to the internets if the clock drifts off and you need to syncronize it. Old computers are cheap and there's android phones at the supermarket for $80
- Be wary of people who want to befriend you if you're known to have a lot of Bitcoins. Targeted social enginering attacks are happening. If it's commonly known you have a very large bitcoin holding then even some random hot blond girl who approaches you in a bar may be part of a scam attempt.

And he does reply to the people he has always communicated with and he even answers "yes" or "no" to a few questions from customers (but nobody except those he's known for years seem to get more than that out of him). That is real. And then there is this log:

CNN is not alone here, ALL the mainstream "news" outlets are running the same official BS story SR2 presented. Sure, "transaction malleability is too fancy a term for any one to understand so we were hacked yo, your coins r gone lol but it wasn't us honestly". Cool story bro. The only thing more amazing than this story is that every journalist out there seems to believe it.
One thing to think about: 5 of the moderators / admins from SR2 were arrested a while back yet the site remained. Many people, including myself, have considered SR2 to be a honeypot since then. Could it be that it's been a government black-op since then? There is no way to know for sure but it wouldn't surprise me.

Bitfinex used to be a meta exchange for both Bitstamp and MtGox. Then the Dwolla situation happened and they immediately moved all their customer funds out of the clowncar exchange and dropped them as a partner. Their decision to end MtGox trading made a few BFX customers upset at the time. Now it seems like it was a very wise decision. People can continiue to think that "MtGox wil deliver" just like Butterflyscams did deliver "something" eventually - and perhaps they will. I don't trust them enough to deposit even $1 there myself. If everything is fine then why are so many people in forums, on IRC and everywhere complaining that they haven't got USD wires initiated as early as the beginning of June? Some are even waiting for EUR wired out late May.

This is what is called painting the tape. It is illegal when you do it in stock market, but everything goes on MtGox. I wouldn't buy into this but good luck to those of you who do. And imho 100 or 110 at MtGox isn't really relevant. If I want to sell you 1 Bitcoin and you offer me a promise pay me $105 in two weeks but you can't pay me now.. then your price offer is zero as far as I am concerned. This is specially true when I know that people who tried to get their money out of MtGox early June (5th, 12th, etc) never got it.

perhaps he can't afford the $10/month it costs for real professional charting software (=SierraCharts)? Sierra has a native USD/BTC feed..
SierraCharts is a vastly superior solution. It costs you $10/month for the basic package with live USD/BTC feed and about $40 for the most advanced version (which has kagi and other nice things). It's the obvious choice. There's even a non-.net version which works great under WINE.

You can short BTC at 
The interest rate for borrowing BTC to short is low since there is little short interest right now, about 3% per year or so. You will get 10% off BFX/BFX trading fees the first month if you use the code lOsL9kXEyQ when you sign up there. BFX is also a good choice if you want to sell your BTC and lend the USD you get out at high interest to margin traders, USD rates are now around 300% per year. There's money to be made if you think the rally is over and you want to make a huge profit off those who think it's going strait to $1000.

Oh people _are_ buying Gold. Now, you may not have noticed that someone, much a central bank or two acting in concert, sold 0.8x 1 year of world gold production in April. That was one big paper gold short. Can they cover those futures contracts if buyers ask for delivery? Of course not. They are just betting on their shorts being so big that nobody could possibly buy'em all (except China). Real actual physical gold (which is different from paper) is selling like hot potatoes the world over right now. Bought some gold coins myself and I'll uy more next week. btw, those of you who go out to buy gold will notice that the paper price of gold has little to do with the real price of (actual) gold.

You are doing it wrong, your "bitcoin price" is $104 and that's just wrong, no exchange offers your "bitcoin price". Remove MtGox and only include exchanges where you can sell BTC for USD and you'll get it right. Let me explain this in a simple way since you do not get it. Let's say you have a car you want to sell. Person A comes to you offers to buy your car for $10.000 cash. Person B comes to you and said that he wants to buy your car for $12.000 but does not have it "available at the moment".  Person B promises that he will pay you the $12.000 in 2 months. You wonder what kind of person B is and call all your friends. Many of your friends know person B and tell you that B is in debt to them and that he is months behind on his payments. Now: Who would you sell your car to? The person offering to pay you cash now or the person who says he does not have cash "available" but promises to pay "later"? I wouldn't even consider B's "offer" if this was my car.

I would love to see / hear some numbers on Bitcoins for comparison, how many Bitcoins flow in and out of MtGox each day?
There is the 3600 BTC brand new BTC mined each day to consider. There's also the number of other exchanges to consider, this is why I find  very interesting. Coins tend to flow out of MtGox when there is a price difference (and a change to make profit) between MtGox and places like btcchina. How many coins to in and out of MtGox each day? I'd like to know.

It takes me 1-2 days to get money into Bitstamp, money is sometimes there the next day and sometimes there the day after. Getting money into Bitstamp is very quick and easy for everyone in EU. *IF* getting money out of MtGox was anything near as easy as getting it into Bitstamp then I'd arb the f**k out of it right this minute. But the truth is that I can NOT get my money out of MtGox, and I am not going to send my money there on the off-chance that I will *maby* get to see it again and not for month if I actually do.
I do buy at Bitstamp and sell at MtGox prices minus a pretty huge percentage at localbitcoins, and this kind of arb is profitable. But it's not nearly as profitable as it would be to sell at MtGox prices at MtGox (or elsewhere) - but that's not possible. People are waking up to the fact that something is very wrong at MtGox and people are less and less willing to pay MtGox premium or even 50% or the MtGox premium right now. I sure as hell ain't going to up my localbitcoins bid above Bitstamp, why would I when I can buy at Bitstamp prices at Bitstamp?

Everything in your summary is true. The only amazing thing about it at this point it as the information seems to be new to you. There's nothing new here, MtGox is a scamsite where you're only able to buy overpriced BTC, you can't really sell. You can send them real USD and buy BTC, but you can't sell BTC for real USD. You only get emptyGoxUSD when you sell there. emptyGoxUSD can't be withdrawn, it can only be used to buy their overpriced BTC (which is the only thing you can withdraw). This isn't new, it's been like this for months.
As for SEPA, it seems some get small withdraws some of the time while others do not. Use Bitstamp if you want to use SEPA and have the money in your account the day after, use MtGox if you want to see if you win in the monthly who-gets-some lottery.

I find the article full of speculation and factual errors, in short: Not that great. But it does highlight what some of us have been saying and warning about for quite a while: People are _not_ getting their withdraws, even those made before the withdraw freeze are still "missing".
@_date: 2013-07-17 09:54:22
a) Volume at MtGox is record low. b) MtGox uses one of the biggest banks in the world. c) MtGox is actually quite small compared to that banks other customers in Japan. You would have us believe that a major bank can't process MtGoxs withdraws after volume dropped significantly but _deposits_ are no problem? This is the story MtGox is trying to sell and it does not hold water. MtGox is simply stalling and using fresh deposits to fund withdraws. They are like Mf Global only unregulated.

Goobit och Kapiton are the only Swedish bitcoin dealers I know of that's actually registered with FI. If this FYB PTE LTD is then great, but it's a LTD which means it's probably not a swedish entity.

This story, an other's like it that I've read elsewhere, begs the question: Do MtGox even have the funds? It is very interesting that they still do/allow deposits but not withdrawls. Are they waiting for more deposits in order to use those to cover all the pending withdrawls? Also note that their withdrawl problems started before they made the announcement to simply stop all withdrawls.
