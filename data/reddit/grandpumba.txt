Hey don't look down on them.  Having alt-coins as alternatives is the perfect way to keep the value locked into crypto-currencies so it doesn't all just swap back and forth between bitcoin and fiat.

Yes yes, it's all a conspiracy.

HOLY SHIT!
I just realized they don't buy McDonalds either!  I bet THAT'S why America is attacking ISIS.  They refuse to buy McDonalds.

I'm do not follow Ashton Kutcher on twitter and yet I've just heard about this.  More people can find out about this one tweet than just people following him on twitter.

People need to stop thinking of the price of one bitcoin and think about its smaller possible denominations.
The lowest possible denomination of the American dollar is 1 cent.
The lowest possible denomination of bitcoin is 0.00000001.  With that in mind 1 "bitdollar" (if we are thinking like American currencies - 2 decimal places forward from the lowest possible value) is then 0.000001 bitcoins.  So what is the value of 1 "bitdollar" right now?  0.0004184 US.  So 1 "bitdollar" isn't even worth 1 penny yet.
When you buy 1 bitcoin today what you are really buying is 1,000,000 "bitdollars."

I'm just cursing my bank for delaying the transfer I had to make before I would be able to send it off to the exchange.  I had hoped it would have gone through on Friday.  No such luck.  Now I feel horribly screwed over.
