Some great info and tips here  .The current server is only  being use  for design purposes .We have a dedicated server  set up for when the site goes live.Were going to put the website in maintenance mode till the issue with the images is fix .
OpenBazaar and particl or good projects just  not very  user friendly with a limited about of quality items on their  .Were trying to make spending crypto online as easy and streamline as possible for the average consumer  .
Just curious what is your background ?You seem to be very knowledgeable about webdesign and servers ?

That is  pretty short sighted .Everybody should buy a certain amount and put it away for online purchases.

Generally i like using dogecoin and digibyte to make purchases .Fast and cheap options.I use bitcoin for bigger purchases .

We have a lots more build then that .Apple and android apps already develop .The site need a small bit more work i agree with you their  .We have other things in development but need to have something up and running to show people .Were one of the few projects to actually have something actually viable and working not just a whitepaper with promises so i think we should get a little credit  .
I agree other people can try copy but they cant source  high quality items at sell at the prices were selling at .They dont have the expert marketing ,development teams we have nor the experience in eCommerce or crypto trading .
Good point and were currently trying to build a actual practical  decentralise system for certain goods .I not going into to much here  since we already had people copy our whitepaper word for word and launch a knockoff IEO

Yeah but they are pretty terrible .Even our old marketplace blows then out of the water and that has a limited item selection with a very basic design .The new marketplace with have thousands of items and will be cheaper then  eBay and Amazon .


We will have non chargeback fiat options such as GreenDot and paysafecard for example so people without cryptocurrency  currently can use the marketplace as well .


I believe it will with the range of products at very competitive prices and with a wide range of payment options on offer we will appeal to the masses.
Thanks for the feedback very informative.  I will get the marketing team to do a video do a video that covers the good point you brought up that were never really explained in the video .

Ahh good point thanks for pointing that out  .We will  have to edit that .I didn't hear spot that will now till you brought it up.Should have been first marketplace to offer a wide range of no charge backable payment options .
