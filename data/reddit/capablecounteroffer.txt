Sorry but that is incorrect. Doesn't matter if the government thinks its not real currency. Anything you buy that appreciates and then you sell at a higher price is subject to capital gains tax. Also, the state does recognize it as an asset of value, at least in the United States, and you spelt technically wrong, and also everyone doesn't think it is monopoly money.

does this factor in how much of the "sent" bitcoin is actually just change?

The release notes themselves claim it is not fully implemented, and based on its functionality I'm going to go ahead and agree with them. You can choose to believe whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:26:19
Well it's not fully implemented, and also if you send anyone money from a segwit address then by default all your change goes to a legacy address. Nevermind the fact that it is only implemented for the "testing/expert" level, it certainly makes sense that those who rely on core to handle their transactions are not using segwit. Nonetheless, instead of complaining about it Kraken should start contributing to core so that we have a fully functional and implemented core segwit wallet sooner.

You said your impression was core had fully implemented segwit for the cli, but if I remember correctly it doesn't use segwit change addresses by default but rather legacy ones.

First off, there's no other statements by you higher up in this thread. Second of all, the following statement you made:


is grossly incorrect notwithstanding any comment you may have made about harvesting losses. Since you clearly have no understanding of taxation law, you should probably not be giving other people tax advice, since you are just encouraging them to break the law.

If you need brick and mortar, look at a credit union. Personally I think a better option is Schwab or Fidelity. They have no physical branches but you can deposit checks with your phone for free or by mailing them in. Both have no account minimum no monthly fees and no ATM fees and they also refund you any fees that the ATM charges you. I've literally never been charged any fee of any type by them and I've have my account at $0 for months at times before and use the debit card all over the world for free. Fidelity also has amazing customer service, takes &lt; 2 min to be on the phone with an actual person, Schwab idk never had to call customer service.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:34:43


IIRC, it also takes up slightly less space for an all else equal transaction and therefore results in slightly lower fees.

In addition, the Fed's intentions are well know and laid out in advance to avoid sudden jolts to the market.

Or better yet, what if no one knows the poptarts have rat poison in them, because a certain agency isn't regulating the production and sale of foodstuffs.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:12:13


The FDA and the EPA are two such agencies that decide if certain chemicals are dangerous and cannot be in foodstuffs or must be regulated as drugs or cannot be in our water supply or air. And no, you cannot sue about anything, and no the jury does not decide if it is a valid claim or not. The judge decides whether to accept the lawsuit or throw it out, the jury decides if someone was indeed at fault.
You cited one example. [Here]( is something that popped up as the result of a quick google search, showing numerous cases of the EPA not failing and in fact doing their job to protect us.

I can do my own research, but the original comment was completely misleading, suggesting that all of it was "lost" in one day and that day specifically being 9/10. Furthermore it apparently was well known on a national level prior to that day.

I recognize that, but you clearly don't seem to be getting my point, so nevermind.
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:41:29
My point is that if no one "wants the dollar" that would mean the US would be a seriously failed economy/country on the verge of collapsing. It wouldn't be likely that anyone would be willing to lend them money. If the dollar was no longer the leading currency, people would still "want it" and they would still issue bonds in dollars. See every other developed country that issues debt in their own currency.
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:22:08


If no one wants the dollar, nobody will be interested in buying US bonds either
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:25:04


Printing dollars (specifically enough to pay off the debt) will "steal" money from American citizens, not just because they own some of those dollars but also because the US's position in the world economy would be shattered. None of this matters because the Fed controls the money supply not the government, and furthermore if we ever had an issue servicing our debt we would either no longer be a world power even remotely or we would just use our military power to deal with it.

Where does it say he announced it on that day? I just saw it in a sidebar, almost as if it was just a supporting fact.
@_date: 2019-03-30 20:20:38
This isn't remotely a relevant example. The pound is still a strong currency and people still "want" them.
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:06:40
Ah okay I get your point now. To be fair however, when bonds are priced and interest rates set, investors do account for expected inflation.
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:39:30
The Fed does do this, they target 2% inflation, but it does not "wipe off" debt. The Fed is a separate entity from the US government, they purchase US Treasury bonds to put this money into circulation and it does not affect the amount of debt the US government has outstanding. My understanding is it works the same in the UK. Furthermore, it isn't a "sweet spot... that people don't mind or notice." The explicit purpose of 2% inflation is that it causes people to not hoard currency but rather spend or invest it.
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:43:12
It doesn't say when or over what time period and considering the budget at the time was less than $400bn annual I have a weird feeling it wasn't in one day but rather over the course of years or probably decades.

No. Why would economics be capitalized? No other science is capitalized like that. We write physics, mathematics, sociology, and psychology all lowercase.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:09:58


 
It is a science, a social science specifically.


Do you have a rationale or source for this? I've only seen it as if you mentioned your whole degree you capitalize it such as my degree is a B.S. in Economics whereas if you are just mentioning your major you keep it lowercase such as oh I studied economics in college.


And what's your rationale for that? Me calling economics a science which it is, or me not incorrectly capitalizing economics?

You can debate the credibility of the charges against him, but I wouldn't call evading the police by staying in a foreign embassy "solitary confinement." He can leave whenever he wants, he's just likely to be arrested due to the outstanding arrest warrant.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:42:45
The original warrant was to extradite him to Sweden to face charges for sexual assault. Those charges have since been dropped, but there is still a warrant out for him skipping bail during the extradition proceedings.

With what distro? Usually software can be found in your package manager, if not you can usually download a .deb or .rpm, and the least simple solution is to download a tarball and compile from source, which really isn't too complicated of a process.

That's not really an objective statement.

Nobody "owns" the Fed. It was created by the federal government, and after covering operating costs all the interest it receives from Treasury bonds is returned to the federal government. The government also doesn't directly borrow money from them, the government just auctions bonds and the Fed purchases some of them in the auctions and also in the open market from other people owning them. IIRC the Fed is also not the largest owner of Treasury bonds. The reason the Fed prints money instead of the government doing on it's own in theory is to reduce the risk of politicization of the money supply and maintain a degree of independence from the federal government, although the current administration is seems to be trying to violate that concept by bullying the fed into holding or dropping interest rates.  
This is interestingly contrasted most famously by Switzerland, where IIRC the central bank is privately owned.
