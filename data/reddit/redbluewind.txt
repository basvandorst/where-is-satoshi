This is why index funds were a godsend - saves people from themselves!

Thx for your perspective. Do you think BTC will go to zero and some other coin will become the accepted thing?

You know nothing about finance or econ. You're gambling.

This right here encapsulates the ridiculousness of crypto to me, and one of the main reasons it will be tough for the mainstream, non-tech folks to ever adopt it. People understand that a goofy green piece of paper with Ben Franklin's face on it won't just stop working. They can leave it in their wallet or under their bed for 10 years and feel 100% safe that they'll be able to use it. Of course, it will have lost some value due to inflation, but the physical object itself will remain intact and legal tender.
Hard drives fail. Exchanges get hacked. These are well-known concepts, even by non-tech folks.
Right this minute, someone is counterfeiting USD and profiting from it. The thing is, the number of counterfeiters pales in comparison to the number of hackers in the world. I wouldn't be surprised if there were 1 counterfeiter for every 100,000 hackers.
An entire generation of people are going to have to die before BTC even has a *chance* of being adopted at a wide scale. Open to hearing opposing thoughts, of course.
