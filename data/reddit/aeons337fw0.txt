Still holding the same amount....before this dip....when value increases again, then ready to gain back and then some

a cool link. 
London England time huh?
sigh... i remember when it was Greenwich Meantime...but o well I must be ancient.I stood once in 'two time zones' there on a school trip, ha!

Thanks for the well written piece on the office reactions...yeah!
I was in crypto since 2011...and 3 years ago when about to quit my job and move  overseas....had two Neptune miners knc running in 2015 [ in the days before the miner farms]... and no regrets... and another smaller one under my office desk....cool

I fully understand how you feel, its like we have to be a cross between a cryptographer, rocket scientist and programmer to ‘get this s...t’ and I for one had no training for this, but thats part of the fun challenge. I have claimed several forks successfully but have lost many nights sleep ha!

Go to the shortcut for bitcoin-qt on your desktop and click properties.
put in this""C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -datadir=G:\Bitcoin" 
or whatever letter drive is your new large one, eg: G, or F or whatever. It works for me.
You will need the Bitcoin Folder created on the new HD and then it will work. 
I tried to explain simply....because often people assume you understand each step, when in fact , we often do not.

That's what I love about bitcoin.In the time it takes me to make a cup of coffee here, and then sit down with it to glance at the price again,and up 600 or more, Ha!
Boring it is not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:30:15
Seems fairly accurate assumption connecting those dots. Perhaps things will re balance in BTC favor once Coinbase finally allows the sale of that 'other coin' on Jan 1st....and people dump it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:54
Good question(..and I laughed about dtrumps comment about living under a rock.)
Actually my transaction always take about ten minutes to 90 minutes to cash in or out, or send bitcoin...so 'the rock i live under' according to dtrump..is a pretty reasonable one.
I'm in Thailand too

meant to post this link too

You can also use ABC Cash and Bitcoin Gold Core wallets for BCH and BTG but you have to download the whole blockchain too. It works, I did it for both.Then exchange for BTC on either HitBTC or Bittrex, worked for me.

Yes, I always pay my phone and internet service on an exchange. Coins.co.th is good for this.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:10:43
Super informative. Thanks.

pretty scary stuff...if true

I found the easiest way was using a BitcoinABC to get the BCC from the Core wallet, but of course first i saved my BTC in a new Core Wallet with a new encryption,before doing that.I used the now 'empty'core wallet .dat file and the old encryption code to put in the ABC wallet and then my BCC coins appeared. But it may take a while for the blockchain to update ....
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:23
I like this... before you can drink a morning coffee and get dressed, after checking the prices of course.Check again and up 500-1,000 more. Lovely.

The ride is always exciting.I never get tired of it , not since i bought 28 BTC at $5.99 cents  'back in the day'...I have been in since 2011. Unfortunately they got stolen between Mt.Gox and an Australian  Cryptoxchange.com that no one ever seems to remember.I do though, because they ran off with 30-60 of my BTC . Its all a learning curve....o well.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:22
I'm willing to check it for you, if you want to mail it to me. I am accustomed to usb's storing bitcoin scenario.But I'm not in LA.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:38:08
Yes I got that same screenshot on my phone real time here a little while ago. and sent it to some family....my lucky number is 7 so how cool is this? [Its 2.37am here now.]
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:46:23
I use bitcoin core too and recently found these fantastic tutorials here to help me lose my fear of claiming.
all best
PS: Move all coins first to a new wallet.

If its any consolation, you are not the only one who lost all their bitcoins to scammers. I did too in 2016. Before forking became the new fad it was "hyip sites'" promising huge returns on your investments [all scams of course]. The websites looked so convincing but all lies,  too good to be true...and they disappeared with all the bitcoins after a few weeks.I was stupid. Now I have started over more carefully. Sigh.

Time to zoom out and look at the 6month chart or 2year chart and not feel so bad. Hodl .
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:07:49
its not 'boring'.....and I'm thinking the rebound will be so much fun to watch especially when it goes way higher than ever before

That's what I think too. And as trendgiver indicated here, it seems they may want to ban exchanges, but not crypto's.  One on one trading is cool still in a scenario like that, without exchanges, if they do decide to ban and shutter exchanges
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:51:20
Yup zooming out to a 3 day chart is not so scary....back like we were a couple of days ago...flash mini crash in a few minutes

Asides from that quote in the China Securities Journal, is there any other source to show why this 'panic' in China? in 50 minutes down about 320 USD ....and very volatile now
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:36:33
yeah down 160 USD in only a few minutes.Wonder why?
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:35:43
Thanks. It sounds interesting and like a good thing.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:46:20
Yup...just have to fire up that  laptop once you blow the dust off. Then you'll be happy, checking once again.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:32:49
Hmm just seems the other day was at 4,980 and now is 4,300. Hanging on tight. It will go up when its ready, just HODL
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:11:18
It will probably be Monday before the officials there clarify their position.Right now we have rumours and bad translations and some panic, but not much substance ...yet
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:46:02
and what about web trackers and cookies that a recent MIT study said enabled them to ID 60 percent of the individuals using bitcoin transactions.....?
 
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:23:05
I will prod it with a stick.I want it to be over 3,300 next week.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:14:23
I ran 2 Neptunes a few years ago.Its true they worked well, but the cost of power consumption where i lived was so high, the 'profits' were very low. I think free power or very low cost power is crucial, in hindsight.
