Where on their site do they mention this?
EDIT: Yes I see it now, you have to actually head to the checkout before seeing it.
Pretty excited to spend bitcoins here.

a closed system only temporarily inflates the price.  Vendors instantly converting to fiat helps keep the price at more accurate levels and increases liquidity.

CEO of caVirtEx has been pushing for regulations for a while.  Seems rent seeking still pays off.

All these guys with big long titles sure do like to copy and paste from the econ 101 textbooks.

We live in a country that is ruled by decree.
A country where the finance minister goes to visit bankers to tell them not to charge such low interest rates.
A country where the answer to suspected electoral fraud is to strip the position of lead investigator of the powers to investigate electoral fraud.
A country where tough on crime doesn't include 90k cheques to senators as hush money to cover up campaign finance laundering.
This is the country where flaherty recently decreed:
“It is important to continually improve Canada’s regime to address emerging risks, including virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, that threaten Canada’s international leadership in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing” 
This government sees compromise as weakness.  They don't care if there are benefits from bitcoin, they have decreed this, and that is that.

Great, now you are going to bring Al Gore in here agains bitcoin.

I also like to use bitaddress to make passwords.  I just pick 16-20 characters out of a private key.  Nice and random.

who just wrote three paragraphs arguing against this one statement.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:40:24
No, I am not saying give up.  I am saying that you can't just write a letter to Flaherty and think he is even going to read it.
The only ways I see to get a better stance on bitcoin is:
1 - figure out how bitcoin can be used to fight gay weddings while helping cats marry.  How can bitcoins make Alberta more money?  How can they help the oil industry?  How can bitcoins be used to fight charities (now known as terrorist organizations)?  My point is, you have to appeal to their base.  That isn't easy.  
2 - Make their idiocy blatently apparent in the media and the like.  I don't think there is much hope for this one.  I mean, you must have noticed the f-35 fiasco?  The whole senate thing?  The whole election thing?  They don't really care about looking like idiots.  
I was thinking a bounty for anti conservatives adds.  The anti conservative add that got the most views on youtube over the last week gets a bitcoin or whatever.

I tell them to get verified on an exchange and send in the minimum amount they can, then play with that amount till they feel confident in spending more.
I also tell them about how I first got into bitcoins because they interested me and I wanted a VPN so I put in $100 for my $50 VPN, so I had a little left over to play with.

MP3 players came out long before iPods.  I am still struggling to see what is so great about iPods.  I own one and find it a hassle having to use itunes, I just use my trusty old MP3 player.

uhmmm... If it always crashes the same, if this is the bottom.  
Also, you might have noticed that after the early july low there was 4 months of relative calm?

Is this a way of telling me I am above average or below average?  I don't feel like the existing currencies and payment processors perfectly fit my needs.  Not even close.
1 example that is very important to me: push vs pull.  Had my cc # stolen last year by a merchant that I used it with.
2nd example - cheques that take 2 weeks to clear.  Last year a business wrote the company I work for a cheque, that was deposited in an account and then I got my paycheque.  The first company went bankrupt, making the first cheque bounce, then mine.  I had already spent that money, insufficient funds on a few payment, it was a disaster.
3 - deflationary.  Incentive to save.
so many other things that I won't get into.

QuickBT is not a fraud I have used them quite a few times.  There has occasionally been a glitch here and there that caused a delay in the transaction, but they always have came through.
I don't want to get into what the possible holdup is, but I imagine you will get an email reply today for sure.
As far as I know they haven't had any chargebacks yet and I think they would want to keep it that way, to keep their relationship with their banking partner in excellent standing. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:09:58
what people do with bitcoins after you send them to someone else is their business.
This closed economy you seem to think will drive the price up isn't going to happen.  You are looking to bring the price up artificially, and that always causes it to crash back down in the end.

just a heads up, ING doesn't work with caVirtEx or VOS in case you plan on using them. In the case of caVirtEx, I know that vagogo is not  a bill payment option for some reason.

That fact that this is what is going to make you stop voting conservative means that even if you wanted to help, I don't think you could do to lack of critical thinking skills.

good point, if no canadians ever did cross border money transmission, all we would have to eat is beavers and tar sands.

It does seem odd that so many businesses would ignore the 51st state.  If they have it integrated into tigerdirect.com, why is it so hard to add it to tigerdirect.ca?

I don't think Canadian leaders are that smart.
For that matter, I don't think Canadians are that smart.  For all this talk of money laundering and how great fintrac is, our governing party has been pretty good at it.  
Why, if FINTRAC follows all transactions over 10K did they not catch the $90k cheque to a sitting senator from the PMO, when the $90k was hush money to cover up campaign fundraising illegalities?
Also, in out affair and ten other scandals or so that FINTRAC didn't care about.
It's flaherty's new boogeyman, if you're not with him, you are a terrorist.

how do you know it's not already?
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:29:31
I think flaherty and the conservatives in general are the bigger problem.  They don't really give a damn about public opinion, or anything for that matter.  Once they decree something, it is done.
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:20:21
I don't think you realize who you are dealing with.  The conservatives don't listen to common folk.  It's not how they operate.  They have made up their mind, that is that.
Admitting to being wrong is not an option for them, they don't do it.  They don't care about the consequences.  All they care about is sounding tough on crime, even if they are the criminals.
The only money launderers I know of in this country are the conservatives (90K cheque to a senator to hush him on campaign finances and the like).
If you try to reason with a criminal, you are going to have a bad time.

The internet of 1993 (year I got a computer) blew my mind.  I could never understand why people made fun of me for being so excited about it.
IRC, porn, warez, newsgroups.  Nobody else found these things earth changing.  Still kind of baffled by it.

Why would you sell for less than you bought for?
Perhaps think of dollar cost averaging next time.
People who bought in April when it was over $200 probably regretted it in July when the price was $65, but as long as they didn't sell for a loss, they did okay.

Anytime somebody tries to tell me they are in group with "above average IQ" I tend to think the opposite.
This type of thinking tends to lead to hubris.

Pretty hard to keep it down to 25%.  It can take months to redistribute wealth after a bubble, and then you just get another bubble, so you have to start over again.

It's so much worse than you can imagine.
Our prime minister makes Nixon look like a saint, yet he still has 30% support, and all that is needed for a majority here is 38%.  That 38% gives the PM 100% of the power, and he gets to appoint senators, and then uses those senators to raise campaign funds, at taxpayer expenses.
