You arent buying and selling on paper wallet.
You are buying on coinbase and sending the coins to your paper wallet.
The paper wallet is just a paper version of your keys.
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:27:34
Open up another digital wallet like Mycelium or Coinomi and then "restore a wallet" with the private keys on your paper wallet.
Then you can send those coins to anyone or an exchange to sell.

Waste of time article. 
7 ways include:
Pretty lame...
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:11:38
You know that you can send BTC from coinbase to any other wallet you like?
You don't have to (and shouldn't) keep your coins on coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:19:49
The icon to send is in the top right hand corner of each coins "account"
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:19:04
You absolutely can.
Go to your BTC account and press the arrow head button to send you BTC to another wallet.
I buy on coinbase (would prefer not too, but its easy and i live abroad so don't have all the KYC docs for bitfinex) and always send the funds to my cold storage wallet in my ledger.

That's not true in the case of ledge at least. It only shows you the seed keys once. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:33:17
Hardware wallets are less than a hundred bucks?? Not that expensive.
Also old computers have a habit of dieing...
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:27:59
A cheap lesson in the grand scheme of things. Don't let it kick you out of the game though, we're just beginning.
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:06:01
Me too. I live abroad and feel so much safer having a decent amount of my wealth in BTC. HSBC closed my account ramdomly 2 years ago and it caused big problems, stuck in Thailand without access to funds.
My UK banks are always stopping my cards due to "suspicious transactions", otherwise known as using the card abroad and shopping online in the UK... I was on the phone to them every month to get my card unlocked.
So now I use Revolut, Wirex and Monzo and keep my savings nice and safe in my ledger.

I ran a crypto news website for a while and constantly advertised writing jobs. 
Load of people applied. 100% of them were men. 
There are less women interested in "blockchain" than men are. Try and deal with that. It's not bad. It just "is".
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:33:32
This seems a good approach. Mentally prepare to lose the gains but hold for more.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:04:01
World government or bitcoin. We only get to pick one.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:37:32
I live in Thailand, and you will struggle (understatement) to reliable find  places to pay with BTC. There are places, but it's rare.
Just cash out some and withdraw from the ATM.
220 baht atm fee for foreign cards is such a scam. Also the Thai baht is painfully stong at the moment.

@_date: 2018-11-17 07:17:48
I recommend getting rekt on Bitmex. A nice 20x leverage and wait a few mins for the bots to liquidate your postion, then the market will carry on as normal. Nice way to spend a morning feeling your stomach somewhere around your ankles. 
The great thing about throwing away satoshis though is it really makes you appreciate what you had before. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:01:36
Just wish i had some more fiat

Another one bites the dust.
This asset doubles every year and you sell at an annual low.
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:56:20
Actually most of this guy's other posts seemed quite reasonable with respect to bitcoin. I think as other people have said, Forbes and by extension the writer is being paid to FUD at the moment BTC was weakest to add to the panic and drive prices a little bit lower
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:25:25
Amazing, well done. I shared your link.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:47:56
Should we be worried? Absolutely not. As the article in The Decentral explains, the bitcoin network doesn't care one bit for the price and neither should any of us.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:14:46
In time people will realise this. The problem is most people don't have a nuanced conception of BTC and BCH let alone BCHSV et al

What if bitcoin was more like gunpowder than a business like myspace?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:06:38
Thats true. A cell phone now is closer to a computer than a phone.
So that still leaves the computer being one of the only new things.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:36:49
Agreed. Ecomonies work fine with hard money and society is better for it. All the cool stuff was invented, painted or composed under the gold standard.

Will do for sure :)
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:28:09
The idea is or all of them.
If the exchange went bankrupt then it means it never had the assets in storage that it was trading.
Also i'm not expecting everyone to withdraw, perhaps 20% if we are really lucky. Realistically..
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:35:31
Thanks Septem\_151 :)
@_date: 2019-01-24 05:23:59
It makes micro payments more feasible too.
To be honest at this point for me it's just a cool toy. I dont have the transaction volumes on my site to make it really 'needed'.
But it was a fun project and I was going to run a bitcoin node anyway which is important to have a voice and properly participate in the network.
I like the idea that I can verify transactions, make on and off chain transaction without any 3rd party to validate / confirm. 
It's just like a personal decentralised bitcoin banking system :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:58:01
I'm not looking at the short term and could really care less about the price today or the tech. BTC can stay on the same code version as far as i'm concerned and most "blockchain projects" could be easily reconceived as "database projects".
Its philosophical for me. Bitcoin is harder money than dollars, pounds and baht (I'm in Thailand) and i'm slowly building wealth in sats not bucks.
I was absolutely delighted to see that dip yesterday.
I wish this bear market lasts another few months so I can keep accumulating.

I made a video for proof of keys to help raise awareness too.
If people haven't removed assets by now they aren't going to.
The story today for The Decentral was this. r/btc and r/jordanpeterson have up voted it to over 100 each.
For some reason it didn't land in r/bitcoin today. No worries.
Next focus is building and filming the lightning node setup...

The miners still make money from transaction fees. And by that point the fees for a first layer transaction are likely to be huge.

I can see that point of view, but one thing i would say is that inflation is not the 'main point' of a currency. It's just we have had currencies in the past that people can increase the supply of. Over production of precious metals and printing more paper fiat.
It's not the main point at all actually, it's the worst part.
What that means is that cash has been a terrible store of value. I think when it comes down to it, bitcoin being a better store of value than gold and fiat will be more important to people than buying coffee.
We need somewhere to store our labour that is safe.
Its the one asset you can hold that no one can make more of. If you hold 21 bitcoin, you own 1/1,000,000 (obviously way more with lost coins) of the total supply. 
No government can rob your wealth with inflation. Which is what they do now. They print away their debts and stop normal people from ever becoming wealthy.
I'd recommend reading Saiffedean Ammous' "Bitcoin Standard" and his speach in Austria. It changed my perspective a lot.

Let people do what they want, just because there is more men in Crypto doesn't mean there isn't equality of access.
Men and women have different interests, generally speaking.
No one says "we need more women working on oil rigs", just for the good stuff eh...
Please don't infect crypto with this SJW bullshit. It's a virus that's already doing enough damage!

Thats a good point, but the project is called the 'Blockstream Satellite' by Blockstream themselves.
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:58:48
You said it yourself. Decentralised currency. Better and fairer. 
It's still a baby. When the volatility is gone, BTC is going to be very expensive. Early adopters and visionaries taking a profit in the first few decades is the same story from the industrial revolution (probably before) up to the dot com boom. 
Everyone uses Google and facebook now but only a few became rich from speculating on them.

It is kind of a run on the bank, but with the expectation they should be solvent.

It's probably fine but better to order from their own website.
Having said that... When you set it up it will show the seed keys only once for you to write down. Never again. So if you set it up and write down your keys then in theory it is secure.
As far as I'm aware the people who got screwed got hardware wallets with a pre written seed key sheet.
Nevertheless I bought my ledger nano directly from them in France.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:37:11
You may ;)
Instantly on Coinbase. However i would advise you to make a wallet where you control the keys and transfer your BTC to that.
Coinomi is easy to start with on your phone.
But buy a Ledger Nano or Trezor if you intend to hold a decent amount.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:55:08
It would be awesome if you could paste this into the comments section on the article. This needs discussing more I think.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:47:47
Appreciate that :) just trying to learn.
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:21:51
This isn't about where to buy :) coinbase is fine.
The main point is that you should keep your assets in a wallet that you control the private keys.
Coinomi, jaxx, mycelium are a few mobile wallets.
Ledger and trezor are great hardware wallets (I use a ledge nano s).
DYOR and remember, "Not your keys, not your coins".
Buy from coinbase, but then get your stuff off there immediately. It's not a bank, it's a shop.
Also keep good care of your seed keys. If you lose them and then break your phone or computer for example your coins are gone forever.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:15:34
You should use a wallet that gives you control over the private keys.
Coinbase is relatively safe for small sums but it is a 'custodial account'. They are in control of your funds and may or may not give it back to you at a pace they decide.
A hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger is money well spent. You could also start with Coinomi, Jaxx or Mycelium.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:09:30
Erm... that's not a great argument.
He is making a ton of cash, true. But only because he has millions of fans and fills huge venues now when he speaks.
Incels are pathetic, but not neccessarily on the right or conservative. 
Peterson absolutely is not alt right, whatever that means now. He's just a conservative with a simple obvious message that shouldn't be a thing but is, because PC culture has gone off the rails.
All he really says is men should be responsible and self supporting.
Tidy your room.
Dont lie.

I'm implying your governement has been screwing the Argentine people with bad economic management and reckless printing for years.
BTC price is erratic at the moment, because it's a fring asset.
In the future though...
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:21:08
It is. But far too many buy btc on coinbase and leave them there.
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:28:07
Very. They seem to have changed strategy dramatically. I suspect they are hoping to prop up volume levels.

No leverage. No holding through parabolic growth. Don't mess with shitcoins. Most blockchains projects are glorified databases with a token on top. Tokens have token value. Retail investors are idiots. Crypto news is paid PR. Mcaffe can't be trusted. Vitalik can. Charlie lee was right about the bear market. You don't know what you don't know. Will be fun anyway.

I always made the distinction between those who believe in the primacy of the individual (right) and those who fabour the group (left).
It seems to me the debate now is about individual/group and nationlist/globalist.

He didn't just match him. 2x or 3x at least.
Second only to Mao.
You're right though, 'right' and 'conservative' are dirty words.

If they don't see the value in physical silver bullion they are unlikely to choose bitcoin either. 
I wonder if anyone was edited out and he had to give some silver away

2000% growth in jobs advertised on LinkedIn from 2016.
Only the asset values are in a bear market. The development / technical space is booming behind the scenes.

Is there a full version? 
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:15:45
- Start with Coinbase.
- Verify account and buy.
- Then grab a beer and sit down to watch  Andreas Antonopolous on Youtube and then Saiffedean Ammous.

Its been a hard year for us too. Push through! The light is near.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:50:10
Hope so.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:52:39
Why transfer to bitpay?
You should be able to buy with bank transfer or credit card.
Then you should transfer the coins to a private wallet you control.
Now you own BTC. As you will learn from Andreas... "not your keys, not your coins".

And that women who asked "is the hershey bar real? Doesn't seem real". Hahaha

What's the returns like on bitfinex? I was looking at that too a while back.
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:46:47
And coincidental 'wallet maintenance'
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:02:01
I quite like him. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:42:18
Thanks for this. Investigating.

2019 will be an interesting year! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:04:29
Approved :)
Thanks for that.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:10:48
You mean left?
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:14:52
That's an excellent point, I'll make it more clear the 3rd is  more of a deadline than an event. Thanks!
And quite right about everything else too!
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:10:07
Thanks for info :) any chance you could copy and paste paste that onto the article's comments for others to read?

Haha no, it only really concerns people who keep their assets on exchanges by default
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:03:01
I can see that point of view. A bit more self reflection is definitely a good thing. 
But on the other side, toughening up would be good for a lot of people too. Not just being shielded from bad words and ideas, but having a culture of 'thick skin'.
Anyway i guess it comes down to outlook. I always see the world as a dark and dangeous place that will eat us up if we aren't prepared to fight and struggle. I notice on the left people are much more optimistic and think everything would be perfect if we just accepted each other more.
@_date: 2018-12-23 08:24:10
It could do, but i've heard arguments for a fall too.
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:38:16
I hope so, but unfortunately knowing Mark Dice, it is real.
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:53:13
Absolutely. The mining fee will compensate the miners, though by that stage the fee is going to be pretty expensive for users on the first layer.
This is deeply contentious within the bitcoin community between store of value and digital cash advocates / believers.

Political Correct was a term coined in Maoist china. 
It's about the power over language and who can say and think x and y.
It's always sold on compassionate grounds though.
For instance i believe Europe has taken in too many single male immigrants from conflict zones. That is a politically incorrect thing to say and i will be judged and ostracized in fashionable middle class circles back home in London.
Politically correctness stifles free thought and debate. There are topics that we arent allowed to disuss without being 'shut down'.
Brexit, trump, immigration, pronouns...

They are pretty much the same, just vary in usability. 
They only show the seedkey once, so in theory they can't be tampered with. 
They are pretty much the safest way to store your assets. But DYOR as i'm just a ledger customer, not a security expert.

It depends if you believe in an international financial network that all can participate and non can censor or debase.
Personally i'm buying as much as I can. I had a target for this EOY and the bears have brought me an early xmas present. Bitcoin is affordable again.

Laurie Penny is the worst. There is a hilarious video of her being taken to town for being an entitled brat by David Starkey on YouTube.
