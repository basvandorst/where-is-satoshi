Thanks for sharing! And agree Simon Dixon has very interesting views and I like his modesty.

Just that you never should 'cash out' all, you need to diversify and have a certain percentage of bitcoins in your portfolio as a hedge. Diversify in stocks, bonds, real estate, dollars, gold, bitcoins, etc.
'Cashing out' *all* your bitcoins into a single asset class is irresponsible financial behavior.

You might like to aim for 2.1 bitcoins for the elite '10 million club' membership (21mm / 2.1).
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:17:32
The club is a bit of a joke. There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever in existence (in 2140). We are now getting close to 17 million bitcoin mined: 
2.1 bitcoins multiplied by 10 million = 21 million.
If you want to be in the elite 'one million club', you need to own 21 bitcoins.

That is why the seller will buy real bitcoins against the current price of $15k, otherwise he indeed has an unlimited risk.

Because Dollar Cost Averaging "just means taking risk later." 


satisfied with his or her target asset allocation, and is comfortable with 
the risk/return characteristics of each strategy, the prudent action is investing the lump sum immediately to gain exposure to the markets 
as soon as possible. But if the investor is primarily concerned with 
minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret (resulting from 
lump-sum investing immediately before a market downturn), then DCA may 
be of use.

That is not how market caps work. It needs a fraction of the capital you suggest. For example, you can get mine below $100k.

The fee is calculated bases on the SIZE of your transaction, not the amount. In other words, it doesn't matter whether your transfer is worth $20 $200 or $200000.

Bitcoin today is an inflationary currency (around 4%). On average each 10 minutes 12.5 new bitcoins come into existence, as a reward for the miners. This 'miner reward' halves each 4 years, and thus the inflation.
In 2020 the next halving takes place, the reward goes from 12.5 bitcoins to 6.25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. In the end there will be only 21 million bitcoins, currently we are almost at 17 million.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:54:53

Each block with transactions added to the blockchain, rewards the miner that found the block with 12.5 bitcoins.
On average a block is found every 10 minutes. If more people start to mine, a block is found quicker. However the difficulty will be increased automatically (on average every two weeks, which is 2016 blocks) to again adjust to an average of 10 minutes.
Each four years the block reward is cut in half. At about June 2020 the block reward will be 6.25 bitcoins per 10 minutes.
Around 2140 there will be no block reward left, the miners are rewarded by the transaction fee only.

There are many physical bitcoins around, among them real collectors items like the Casascius coins. They are more likely to change hands physically; not moving to a new address when ownership changes.
