Let's not get carried away.  nLockTime might force the money to stay in one place for some duration of time, but that's it.  If I manage to obtain the destination address' private key, then I win.
It's also tough to see what practical purpose such a setup could serve.  Who are you proposing we protect, in this case?  The only party I can possibly see making use of scheme like the above would be the operator of an escrow.  And it's _extremely_ unlikely that they would benefit from having such a scheme implemented, because all it does is to ensure that the money they are holding will return in an intervention-free way to the people who own it.  If they were indicted, the fact that the money evaporated from an offline wallet due to nLockTime would not in any way allow them to escape prosecution.
What's most likely going to happen to breach that kind of security is that one of the keyholders gets nabbed in a secret way, and is compelled to give up the other party's names, and then as long as that person is appropriately self-interested, all of the necessary keys will be obtained.

Bitcoin might be a victim of its own success.
We were all very excited when Overstock and other online retailers went ahead and started accepting bitcoin.  They reported huge sales as soon as they accepted it.  What do you think they did with all of that currency?
Well of course they started to sell it.  Do you think the people who were originally holding Bitcoin bought back 100% of what they spent?  Of course not.  So now we have an excess of supply and, behold, a reduction in the value of Bitcoin.
No surprises here.

@_date: 2014-05-12 15:49:25
Well, what problem is bitcoin trying to solve, here?
Is it supposed to prevent you from being compelled to give up your money?  Because one could argue that a safe with cash in it at a secret location or in a secret account does the same exact thing, and is vulnerable to the exact same kind of attack that would work on bitcoin:  Judge holds you in contempt of court until you give up the location of the funds.  I mean, look at [H. Beatty Chadwick]( he was held in jail for 14 years on a civil contempt charge because the judge _suspected_ that he had undisclosed funds in an overseas account.  The hilarious thing is that he was released even though he didn't give up the location of the funds--no Bitcoin required.
Is it supposed to prevent dishonesty in the exchanges?  Seems like Mt. Gox has shown that this isn't a necessary property of the system.  Even an offline wallet with nLockTime transferring funds incrementally into an online floating wallet isn't going to help you if agents seize the people who know where the money is going.
The fact is that violence is always going to override property rights, and no matter how complex or elaborate your safe is, it will not matter if a gun is being held to your head.

If you have a ton of random trading, you would expect to see no long-term change in value (except changes introduced by adjustments in demand) and a lot of noise.  The Fourier transform of Gaussian-distributed noise is a Gaussian.
What would be more interesting than general up-or-down predictions would be a system that lets you detect the presence of insider trading, similar to what we have been seeing with MtGox.

I didn't say that it had no effect, only that a haircut is not identical to quantitative easing.  Obviously, if a currency experiences runaway inflation, the result is generally a disaster for any economy that is based on that currency.
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:40:57
Not quite identical.  Haircuts like this affect depositors without affecting debtors.
Imagine you have two people with zero net worth.  Person A has 10k in deposits and 10k in debts, Person B has no deposits and no debts.  After this haircut, person A will have a negative net worth while person B will be unaffected.  On the other hand, if the government could print money, then both would be unaffected.
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:13:16
It depends.  Printing money can sometimes result in inflation, but it depends on the situation with the economy.  Generally speaking, the government will print money in order to prevent _deflation_, and in the perfect case, money is being printed at the same rate as economic growth.  This is because the economy has a specific demand for money, and that demand goes up as the size of the economy increases; the demand for money determines its value, thus if you see shortages to supply that might cause demand to go up, you would print additional money in order to keep demand the same.

Oh I _definitely_ don't agree with this.  For starters, FactSet has one of the oldest fiber networks in the US, and they continue to maintain this network because it actually offers their customers lower latency to their datacenters than even high-end common carrier networks.


I'm not sure about your characterization, here; the people who went to college hearing about Bitcoin four years ago are all working jobs now after all.  It does seem plausible that people in crypto would be more likely to know about Bitcoin, though.


Maybe, but then people haven't been exactly secretive about the ideas they have.  You could go to any bitcoin developer community and just hang around for awhile if, in spite of the fact that you are paying full time software engineers, you can't think of something valuable for them to be doing.  Or you could even post your idea on one of their forums for a free critique by experts.
It's far more likely that they are using the "send us your ideas" bit as a way to discriminate between people who are merely interested and people who are very involved with bitcoin.  Though it may take a lot of experience to come up with an excellent idea, not much is required to appreciate one.
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:57:21
They may but they likely also have plenty of smart people to come up with ideas, too.
Ideas are really really common.  Even the janitor at jp Morgan likely has an idea for a startup.

Let's talk security.
A debit card implements a three-factor security system.  Something you _have_ (the card), something you _know_ (the pin) and something you _are_ (your identity).  All three items can be provided by someone who isn't you--the first by theft, the second by skimming or fishing, and the third by forgery.  A thief who acquires these three items, and then uses them to make a fraudulent transaction, has committed identity theft.
In what way would a bitcoin debit card be invulnerable, where a traditional debit card would not?
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:21:19
Put a little bit of crypto (perhaps a TPM) in the coin, add some PoS logic, and this can be made perfectly secure.
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:18:56
Without other factors, that "extra money" would have to come from default, or ever-extending credit lines (the result being debt bondage).
In a deflationary currency, interest would have to be negative to be fair.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:16:33
I'm not telling you what you should pay for, I'm telling you what will exist and who the players will wind up being.  Heck, _I_ am tech savvy, and this is a service _I_ would pay for, if the rates were reasonable, because there's no justifiable reason _not_ to pay for such a service.
If bitcoin becomes mainstream, there will be something like a debit card or virtual debit card for Bitcoin which can integrate well with existing point-of-sale systems.  Right now, credit card providers are in the best position to offer this service.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:55:12
Holy shit, congratuflippinlations!  How quickly were you able to liquidate?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:23:07
Bank runs existed before fractional reserve banking.  If a bank can lend out any amount of money, it's possible for a bank run to deplete deposits.  Not sure why you're bringing up Cyprus, here--the FDIC is a US government corporation, it does not insure Cyprus depositors.  Unless you think it's likely that the US government will default the way Cyprus did?
Your first quote seems moot as these exchanges already exist, even for delinquent loans, and it's kind of silly to say that unsecured debts owed by bankrupt corporations could be converted to equity, no matter who owns them.  A bankrupt company is asset negative, the value of such a company's equity would also be negative.  If we're not talking bankruptcy, then this quote effectively breaks down to "I have an idea, let's just _sell_ government corporations to our creditors!"  Fun fact:  The US's largest creditor is the social security trust fund.
Boom and bust economies existed before regulation, before central banks, before central currency, and while we were on the gold standard.  I'm talking about US history in the 1800s, here.  I don't need a crash course in the history of money, though it is thoughtful of you to offer.
The last quote seems more like hyperbolic propaganda than reasoned argument.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:40:37
I'm not really sure what impression of history you have, but the reality was far from rosy.  The 1800s were characterized by boom-and-bust economies, where massive prosperity was followed by crushing times of hardship.  Banks were untrustworthy, and because there was no FDIC, a bank robbery could actually wipe out your savings.  The start of the great depression was characterized by bank runs, and banks actually had to be shuttered because they didn't have enough deposits to pay their withdrawals.

When I used the term "centralized bank," I meant it in the context of a centralized or distributed system.  I didn't mean to refer to _the_ central bank--IE, the federal reserve bank.
But as far as your comments go:  As long as our economy takes risks, there will be loans; as long as there are loans, there will be banks; and as long as these banks offer guarantees about their deposits, there will be a central bank to ensure those guarantees are met.
Not sure why you think the history of a central bank is important.  When America was founded, built, prospered, etc we didn't have Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:14:16
Let's be serious, here.  Identity theft is _real_.  Fraud protection is _necessary_.  Bitcoin is a uniquely powerful technology but also exposes its users to vulnerabilities in very unique ways and this requires novel solutions in addition to the already-existing solutions.  There is no other currency in existence right now where completely untraceable theft is even remotely possible without some sort of physical access.  Can you imagine the panic that would be created if it were possible to hack into a bank vault and _download_ the stores of cash there?
Finally, your remarks about things being "too complicated" indicate that this is a source of frustration.  I don't know who you're venting to, here--_I_ have no problem understanding bitcoin, I'm both a software engineer and a cryptography enthusaist.  What I do know, however, is that Bitcoin can only replace existing currencies in earnest if it's actually easier for the average person to use.  Claiming that the world must grow up for Bitcoin is equivalent to saying that the world isn't ready for Bitcoin.
Like it or not, centralized banks _will_ exist in one form or another, and while hiding your money in your mattress is always an option, the average person is going to want their money to be safe and accessible.  Marketing bitcoin as some sort of "currency for smart people" is the exactly the kind of counterproductive strategy that will prevent it from ever gaining mainstream acceptance.
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:28:52
Ok I think we're in agreement there.
Let me tell you about a virus I tracked at the end of 2012 (it's completely relevant, just bear with me)--the Zeus worm.  I was helping a friend at Comodo Security analyze Zeus.  I'm a pretty capable analyst, and he had the ability to obtain information about these viruses active in the wild.  A few times, I saw live listening post servers which kept track of infected people.  What I saw was shocking.  Thousands of dollars, sometimes entire life savings, drained from people's bank account.
The virus worked by watching your activity on banking websites.  It didn't have to breach SSL, this was an endpoint exploit, which meant that it could see everything you could see.  It worked by inserting additional scripts on the page which, in the background, initiated and completed wire transfers on the user's behalf.  It even created whole confirmation screens to obtain the two-factor from users where the banks required two-factor authentication.
So, unless the banks who were swindled had some kind of insurance in place, users who noticed that they were robbed before closing their session would have no way to reverse such illegal wire transfers.  If consumer protections existed for such users, then not only would it be possible for them to get their money back, but it would also make such viruses less attractive to write.
Wouldn't this be of _some_ benefit to consumers?

Don't be silly, here, security holes exist even in software written by extremely smart people.  The security of the algorithm isn't even the question--it's almost _never_ the question.  When hackers break into an encrypted file it's not because they find a way to circumvent AES or because they have a polynomial solution to discrete log, it's because they exploit some vulnerability of the implementation.
As long as servers are not hack-proof and people are a part of the equation, cryptocurrencies will always be vulnerable to theft by hackers.

Good advice.  My intention is the former--I'll put in an amount I'm willing to lose, and then see what happens.  Bitcoin is currently too volatile for me to be willing to take that much risk.

Hang on a sec.  You don't mean to imply that you're against financial regulation, right?  Sure there are some dumb regulations out there, or some which are badly implemented, but the alternative is much worse.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:13:20
Well, the market argument is that they will continue to be offered as long as there is adequate demand for it.  It could be that banks are shutting down their offerings for international wires for awhile until they can implement the requirement.  Or perhaps it's just spite--profit margins for banks are so fat that I can't imagine they lacked the capital reserves to implement this requirement in short order.
As for that last point about malware--you're basically arguing that there is a point where the cost of the regulation outweighs the benefit, right?  I agree.  I think that might be the case, here, _unless_ the intention is to increase consumer protections for wire transfers over time, starting with 30 minutes.
Edit:  After some thought I think I have to, reluctantly, agree with you.  The legislation, as it is, is useless.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:36:02
And there it is, the nugget of enlightenment amidst a sea of mindless fanaticism.
If we call people who have their money stolen stupid, and accuse them of being at fault because of their own lack of intelligence, then we will be branding bitcoin as a currency for smart people.  This is worse than pointless--it's counterproductive.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:14:46
Yes, you could do that, but let's be realistic here--the average person is going to want the same services provided by their current credit/debit card when they use bitcoin.  This means a card that has fraud protection built in but still allows you to access the totality of your savings any time you need to.  Cold storage, in this case, is laughably inadequate--even if you could somehow make it work, there's no way to insure it.
It's entirely reasonable for a bank to charge for the service of safeguarding your assets and providing you with insurance against fraud.  Normally these charges are taken out of the interest earned on your deposits, effectively a profit sharing arrangement.  If, however, the bank cannot make significant money on interest-bearing loans--something that would almost certainly be the case for bitcoin--then you will have to pay for the right to peace of mind.

A bitcoin bank would also have to charge depositors for the service of safekeeping their money.  As long as the currency were deflationary, this would be true.
@_date: 2013-10-01 22:26:56
Particularly helpful to me, I'm in the area right now and could have been affected by this.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:28:41
Right, for some reason I mixed up the term "fractional reserve banking" with "deposit multiplication".  Yes, you could avoid bank runs by requiring full reserves, but the consequence is that a savings account is now a service you have to pay for.
I didn't bother to watch the video because you said "If you don't understand what this means..."  The problem, here, isn't that I don't understand, it's that I disagree.
Money deposited is not owned by the bank.  Regulated banks cannot use this money any way they see fit.  If a bank is bankrupt, that means that the total value of the bank's equity simply isn't worth enough to cover all debts.  Converting debts into equity in the bank implies some kind of restructuring, and is equivalent to saying "let's let the banks go bankrupt" or "let the banks fail."
Boom and bust economies are caused by speculation bubbles, not control over the money supply.  Speculation bubbles are made possible (for instance) via commodities exchanges, no money manipulation is required to create them.
The problem isn't the person speaking, it's the words being spoken.  It's propaganda, plain and simple, when one vilifies the "other" and glorifies oneself.  I'm sure there are lots of people who feel very strongly about this issue and can eloquently demonize bankers and stock brokers, but I don't see the point in reading about how angry one important person or another is.  For instance, here is a quote by Paul Krugman:
"By definition every long position has to be matched by a short position...furthermore, trading that’s just between speculators can’t affect the spot price.  For speculators to move spot prices, they have to offer people who have physical stuff an incentive to hold more of it — hence, speculators holding long positions, commercial operators short positions."
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:54:30
The problem is not one of technology, it's one of people.  There is no way you can construct a system which is perfectly secure as long as there are people in the system, because people are always exploitable.  In order to balance this out, we have implemented systems which protect users against the financial impacts of theft and fraud, and also which allow us to track transactions in order to catch criminals.
You might say that the people whose identities are stolen somehow _deserve_ this in a bitcoin system because of some foolish act or inadequate effort, but the fact remains that they will make up the majority, and they will not wish to be stolen from or impersonated.  Some enterprising individual will realize that such a majority exists, and will sell them a product.  The product will be some form of fraud-protected debit card, where the bitcoin does not exist on your phone or in your wallet, and which will have hard withdrawal limits set by the bank in order to limit the cost to insure.  And, because the service provider won't be making money on depots, the people who use this service will _pay_ for it.
