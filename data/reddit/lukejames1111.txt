What happened to the mempool around the 16th?

And what exactly are we expecting when at 9:30 exactly?

I'm not worrying at all. If people are worried that a correction over a 1500% increase over a year is normal, then we can afford to lose weak hands.

So what happens if you try sending coins to an address that is incompatible?

If you have $10m, yes. I don't really understand it myself, but as far as I see it the value is relative to the value of the USD.
I could be wrong, but because it's not classed as fiat I think it is easier to trade on an exchange with. The exchanges that I've traded on with actual fiat you need to go through security checks, upload identification etc. But because Tether (or USDT) is classed as a crytpo, and not fiat, you don't need to.

Ah that's really interesting to know, thanks!
Realistically, when do you think segwit and/or Lightning Network would be deployed?
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:53:57
Yeah I've always thought it was just a bit of propaganda. I managed to move $10k for $3 in a couple of hours. Not too bad if you ask me.

Not to agree or disagree with you, but past experiences can never prove the future.

Sorry for replying to a **4 month old comment**, but I've been searching high and low on the internet without finding an answer and I was wondering if you could help.
I'm using Electrum and I am not planning on doing anything with my coins for a long, long time. You mention that my coins will exist on both blockchains, correct? So let's say if one blockchain dies, am I still able to sell my coins as normal? Do I need to do anything like move it to a newer wallet?
Also, maybe a noob question. Let's say I have 10 BTC, after the split I still have 10 coins on each blockchain? What's stopping me from spending all my coins on the blockchain that is going to fail? Would I still have the 10 coins on the other chain?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:34:47
What price did you buy in at?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:42:10
Well, it's not even been 2 months since then. I don't know what you were expecting? You can either sell now for a loss, or you can HODL on until we come out the other side.
Bitcoin isn't some magical money doubling machine. It's called an "investment" for a reason.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:30:26
Thank you! :) This has definitely made it more clear to me.
In my wallet, I only see *x* amount of coins. How do I know which chain which coins are on?
And ultimately when/if one chain "dies", will that just become the Bitcoin standard? Then I can trade how it previously was?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:30:19
Oh shit I didn't even realise!

1,000BTC for $300? Wow how times have changed.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:10:07
Tell me about it. I had 0.5 and I sold that....
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:46:03
Nice! Seems like a sensible idea. A lot of merchants need to see the reason to adopt Bitcoin, so this'll help.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:58:51
Realistically speaking, what do you think will be the limit?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:41:25
You've got to spend money to make money :(

Try getting verified on MtGox. It's been over a month and they're still "reviewing my verification".

I have been with my bank for over 10 years. I have not been charged 1 penny. Ever. 
I also use my bank a lot more than OP's.
