@_date: 2019-07-20 22:27:59
Haha funny how you are searching for help in the safespace Aph telegram channel. Guess why no one comes to help... maybe its because it is not so easy to argue against facts
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:41:49
Well i got banned from Aph group because  i stated facts and thats an official group... what does that tell you ?
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:55:02
Its not these guys are not bankers
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:48:51
Ofc you will keep dreaming no one is gonna trade some shitty neo tokens on a 0 volume exchange. What support you talking about ?
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:43:04

... thanks for proving the point bye
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:41:10
Thats exactly why it is the only coin where the mcap is actually the real mcap lol
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:54:29
How are they dealing with the high fees over there i feel like when a transaction costs 5$ its hardly worth it ?!
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:00:56
Only use bitcoin ? That sounds like a horrible idea lol
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:02:13
Thats some actual cringe.
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:18:30
How to get easy upvotes with no work 101.
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:01:22
You wish
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:32:49
These bots actually still work ?? Wtf
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:43:26
Until you are broke and bitcoin became worthless ofc
@_date: 2018-09-29 01:07:30
@_date: 2018-09-16 09:14:40
Not sure if sarcasm or not. ...
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:35:47
Wut here in germany you pay max 50€ for a hooker an hour... Its legal tho so that probably helps...
@_date: 2019-03-05 11:40:08
It didnt have a 66 billion mcap back then. ..
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:09:37
You not paying for electricity ?
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:04:01

@_date: 2019-03-09 13:56:45
Pretty sure it was deleted weeks ago...
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:28:00
Bitcoin has the biggest mcap of them all if btc moons the altcoins moon even harder. There is just more room to grow for altcoins but ofc there is always a chance they go to 0 if you buy a super shitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 10:17:35
There is money in them and this picture is a repost ...
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:20:01
I guess you held your btc through the drop ? Turned out great lol. Altcoins = high risk high reward i dont see btc doing 2-5x in the bear market like alot of altcoins. Saying altcoins have no reward is just dumb. Plus all altcoins are priced in btc if btc goes up the altcoins that are not complete shitcoins will always go up in dollar price too, if they go up in btc price too you make even more. And calling most altcoins scams is even more stupid. Do proper research and you wont invest in the next bitconnect.
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:02:18
Bitcoin = lower risk ,lower reward /
Altcoins = higher risk, higher reward.
You need to decide what you want
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:08:14
But if you say they look 6 levels deep how can they know its still my wallet ? And where did you get that info in the first place?
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:35:11
Nash soon
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:51:47
No one smart plans to hold forever. And not sure what you mean with smart money  but if you want the most profit investing in altcoins that have a trustworthy team behind them and a proper product is always the right call.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:35:31
So if i buy btc and sell them after that to someone that buys drugs with them they could lock my account ?
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:30:18
Sometimes i want to start scamming seeing how easy it is to find idiots with alot of money...
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:52:39
How not to make money ? Yea dont wanna learn that lesson.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:28:05
Thats what it takes to get upvoted here nowadays? What a joke
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:06:55
Bots ≠ washtrading
@_date: 2018-10-14 10:10:02
First in the world ? I have seen that shit last year.
@_date: 2018-10-27 23:28:45
And probably several hundred spread
@_date: 2018-10-14 10:04:39
@_date: 2019-03-05 11:01:44
No they werent, the mcap was a fraction from what it is now.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:17:24
Because bots 200 upvotes and 0 comments. ....
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:03:07
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:45:30
Yea i doubt btc will be 1000x from what it is now lol
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:47:33
They wont have a problem seeing where all the electricity is going.
@_date: 2019-03-04 10:25:13

I always have a laugh when i see posts like this ��
@_date: 2019-10-10 15:29:20
Wat how ?? Its an exchange
@_date: 2019-08-18 08:40:58
Also great way to get robbed i dont think i would feel safe running around with 10k+ cash in my pockets...
@_date: 2019-10-10 15:31:05
Iam not selling my kyc for 30 bucks sry
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:12:03

@_date: 2019-02-28 22:56:22
And where is the  hashtag? Like this will change anything...
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:01:41
Wow you are stupid. Prefering a product over another = paid chill ? Idiot
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:50:08
I wondered the last week why tf are people still buying but i guess people never learn
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:26:32
Believe all you want but as long as we are under 4.7-5k we are def not in a bull market
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:18:21
Wat ? Just download a normal wallet.....
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:57:44
Good for you still in bear
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:27:56
If the price randomly dropped to 2k at this time he would have bought 6k in btc at 3k and lost 30%. This doesnt do shit when big moves happen...
@_date: 2019-02-21 22:08:08
No ,CZ didnt either tho. ..
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:37:43
right here...
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:13:45
I would do it sell the 50% and get 15% btc for free ? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:39:35
Why would anyone use coinbase ?
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:11:35
By scamming kids ? Lol
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:53:41
What games you playing that made you over 3BTC ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:24:31
I saw it too was happily surprised seeing 0 transactions on it
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:46:06
Binance is loved ? Wut
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:44:34
So in Feb 2018 when the price spiked by more then 20% you say was still a bullmarket ? Maybe dont look at the 1h Charts and zoom a bit out. Btc hit the big resistance at 4.2-4.5  4x in the past months and as long as this resistance isnt broken we are still in the bear.
@_date: 2019-02-09 13:15:54
DCA is the biggest joke i have ever heard about whoever things thats a good strategy is stupid
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:54:28

@_date: 2019-02-28 19:10:00
Yea no
@_date: 2019-04-30 11:24:14
Ofc you can use coinbase why not ?
Use coinbase pro for 0% fee.
@_date: 2019-04-21 11:52:06
Doesnt work for all banks sadly. I tried to set it up for several weeks when btc was 100€ but didnt work with my Bank sadly so i gave up :/
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:48:10
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:17:26
You are on the bitcoin subreddit thats why ,they call every alt a shitcoin here.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:26:13
Could be, could drop to 0
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:01:31
Think only browser but havent checked in a while
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:25:40
Use coinbase pro no fees
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:50:50
Maybe because all the shady shit he does on the daily ? 
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:26:26
You like CZ ? Lol thats a first
@_date: 2019-04-21 21:43:18
Then go to btc pair press sell as market order and you got btc aslong as anyone is even buying...
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:25:53
I think there are bigger reasons to boycott binance but until that happens it will take some time.
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:14:34
@_date: 2019-04-13 08:57:11
But sadly none of that is real wasabi
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:52:15
Now its getting rediculous. ...
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:00:46
Dont listen to anyone on reddit in what coin you should invest in.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:34:33
And i can 100% guarantee it will drop to 0 someday when humans are extinct who is gonna trade it ? 
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:51:50
I remember when they randomly disabled withdrawals for specific coins like tezos had to wait a few months to withdraw.... never using that trash again
@_date: 2019-04-21 12:01:53
Its an exchange go there make an account and sell it
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:12:29
What bottom you talking about ?
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:11:38
Well how much money you have ?....
@_date: 2019-01-18 09:51:13
Haha what a scam 500$ over market
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:52:03
Now you only need a nuclear reactor in your basement.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:36:56
You get anything for doing that ?
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:09:00
Interesting story but this had nothing to do with bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:05:11
Ah fuck off with these stupid posts
@_date: 2019-09-21 09:26:36
People try to search for patterns, like we always do best to just ignore these pointless posts

@_date: 2019-05-09 10:41:49
So she was selling her kid ? Wtf
And did the lawyers know about your btc holdings or how can she take those too ?
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:57:54
Paying 1 $ in btc and 2$ as fee yea worth it
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:26:39
And it costs like 0.5.cents per mix
@_date: 2019-05-25 01:08:06
