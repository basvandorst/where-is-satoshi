We are still serving Kol-Aid at the meetings!? Geez, you would think we could afford something a little more classy now a days!
...But in all seriousness man, What you put in now consider it lost. At this point we are riding the wave. Bitcoin certainly has value in the long term, but we have certainly exceeded that current value. If you have some money you want to gamble with, throw it in the pot.

The fact that people are addressing the possibility of a bubble means it is not bubble.

Breaking SHA-256 would hurt A LOT more things than just BTC.
Anyone trying to 'hack'/heist BTC would be a fool if their goal is profit. Such an act would cause people to lose faith in BTC and the value would plummet. This would only be logical if your goal was to destroy BTC.

[Bitcion Days destoryed](
keep in mind this is just one variable, but it is showing that bitcoin has been moving around quite freely. A large spike would come from someone who has been saving a lot of BTC deciding to liquidate rapidly. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:25:00
congrats to you man! I did the opposite when BTC was at 6 dollars... I decided to pay of *part* of my loans with 4k I had saved instead of buying BTC. Decided it wasn't worth the risk at the time. Blah, hindsight 20/20 and all of that jazz...
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:58:23
Point number 2 is certainly a threat, but it shouldn't be if the attackers goal is to become "bitcoin rich". If anyone ever succeeds at attacking bitcoin for financial gain, it will simultaneously destroy the value of bitcoin. They would be left with a bunch of coins that worthless (minus whatever they can offload before info spreads).
Such an attack would only be rational if your goal is to "destory bitcoin".
This is why the DDoS attacks on gox perplex me so much, if the goal of the attacker is to truly "get cheap coins". they are simultaneously destroying the value of said coins.

You believe you are right. As I see if the network behind BTC will not be overcome by LTC, and BTC serves the same uses as a currency. However, it is still scare and can be used as a store of value. If you believe that BTC is to volatile due to the chicken littles, then LTC can still serve the purpose as a store of value, better than fiat. I feel as if I won't have to look at mt. gox every hour to see if we are crashing to my break even point. It beats holding fiat.
It is similar to transferring USD -&gt; EUR if you suspect inflation of the dollar relative to the euro.

we didnt have much growth today, and a big bear decided it was time to cash out. Everyone else then thinks OMG bubble bursting and cashes out with him. we hit 65. With A LOT of buyer support @ 65, it bounces back up to 69-70 within 4 hours. Everyone that sold below 69 comes here to cry about it, and everyone that missed the buying opportunity comes here to cry about it as well.

Agreed that if BTC were to reach a tipping point of adoption, that would make LTC obsolete, but we are no where near that.
However, in this stage, if you believe BTC to be overvalued at this time due to speculation, LTC still provides a store of value greater than fiat. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:56:28
Due to it's deflationary nature, it can still be used as a store of value. 
Like it or not, BTC is more like a precious metal, than an actual currency, at least in this stage. Its leg up on metals is divisibility and mobility. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 22:16:05
This guy gets it. It's all about what risk you can handle. I've thrown a significant percent of my savings into it, but I can afford to lose it all. It certainly was not keeping pace with inflation in my savings account. To me BTC is an investment but even more so it is a store of value better than USD because 'in the long run' it can not be inflated.

On a related note. Given the current situation/tech, I can't see BTC being accepted at walmart anytime soon. No one is going to wait ~10 mins per person in a check out line. Same thing goes for LTC though, 2.5 mins is still to long to stand there awkwardly, but at least it is an improvement. However, the Dvorak keyboard was an improvement over the QWERTY...

This story gets old. You can also say this for EVERY purchase on silk road too. (The 2 million dollar blunt)

Right. It seems that if the userbase is legitimately growing, then it is actual growth. BTC is deflationary after all...

I wish this wasn't true. We would need respectable vocal proponents that could appear on Fox/CNN/etc. and stand up for the merits of BTC.
I could see Fox taking demonizing BTC because of money laundering (to terrorist) and illicit trade. This would be comical given BTC's potential for liberating and empowering citizens and Foxes 'reported' stance against government control.

agreed, gold and silver do have functional uses. However, they are used widely as a store of value and for vanity purposes.

certainly didn't do that, I only put around $4k when BTC was $19-21.


Good point for the long term. I'm thinking more short term. Instead of cashing out BTC -&gt; USD. Cashing out, some not all, BTC -&gt; LTC. since it is also deflationary in nature. Just until some of the BTC mania dies down, and the chicken littles get scared off.
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:05:07
You are right, it is pure speculation, but at this point so is BTC.
BTC/LTC = P 
I'm not expecting LTC to increase in that equation, but BTC to decrease, in the near future. It is similar to cashing out in USD, but I expect LTC to rise relative to USD at least in the short term.


the same can be said for those that sold at the peak of the bubble in 2011 and whenever this current BTC trend peaks.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:19:13
yeah, that is why I said, it is only ration to do if your goal is destruction of BTC
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:26:03


 Hardly. The supply of USD/Euro/Etc. can increase. The supply of BTC (in the long long run) can never increase and will fall due to BTC being lost/destroyed. That makes BTC even more deflationary than gold, as new gold reserves have the possibility of being discovered. BTC is much more akin to gold that you can slice up into infinitely smaller pieces and transport with ease. 


Agreed, That scenario would be silly. However, I think that shoe fits perfectly.
If all of the world were to abandon fiat and use BTC, then yes LTC would be useless. However, that isn't going to happen (in our lifetime at least) The world can't even agree on one currency, and when it tries to (EUR) it has major drawbacks due to disparity between states
LTC (in theroy) should always be worth it's extraction value, and much like BTC, it will protect you from losses due to inflation in whatever fiat currency you choose.
