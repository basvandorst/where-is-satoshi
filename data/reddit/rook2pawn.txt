what prevents the us government from printing arbitrary amounts of money to buy as much BTC as they want, then selling it off into nothing but dust?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:08:31
Ahh! 
And then we'd be able to sell it for a quadrillion dollars, but then too many people would be walking around with quadrillions of dollars. That's when they release the robot hounds

i swear that i read that Coinbase said they would have withdrawl only and that adding BCH would only confuse users as both have Bitcoin in their name
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:24
agreed. Hold. No sweat here.

They stated they were explicitly not going to add BCH to their platform, only allowing it as a withdrawl option.
Then they surprised everyone with listing it with zero notification in advance. 
That's the least of it. There's another whole side of the insider trading. But the coinbase markets suffered all time absolute highs for it. It was really, really bad.

that's exactly what he did. he moved 1 BTC over as a test.

so dynamic fees with 110% fee multiplier makes sense? ill get the new electrum. im at 2.6.4 and current is 2.7.2
edit: nvm they took out the fee multiplier thing. its just dynamic or RBF now. Ill stick with dynamic?

Don't worry. Imagine if you put the 17.5K in an ALT and about 100% of all the alts lost 75% of their value on top of BTC going down 80%. So you'd lose about 90% of your value in total if you did that. You survived. I bought ICX at 41K sats and rode it down to 23K meanwhile BTC fell dramatically on me.

BNB is a strong one. If you put all your money in BNB it not only held strong since 8k BTC, it rose consistently week after week. It lost less than a percent in the dip that just occurred, hardly a scratch on it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:42:41
why? Alt's are centralized, premined BS that you use to get more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:44:23
if you have funds on say electrum wallet, what if electrum decides to just quit and stop being a wallet service? should i just use bitcoin core and run my own personal wallet?

Make your own decisions. I repeat, do not listen to ANYONE if they think its going to 8.5K then to 5K or they think its going to 11K... etc.. 
It is your own money. Invest wisely, do not FOMO into anything. Stay away from TradingView opinions. MagicPoopCannon is an example that "helped saved"  thousands away from the 6.6K BTC to 9.5K BTC rise.
You make the call. Your profit margins are entirely yours. $100 USD profit or $1000 USD, or $100,000 USD, whatever your level of risk suits you best and makes you feel COMFORTABLE. **WHen you trade outside of your comfort zone, you make mistakes.**
Also, have a plan of when the price of BTC goes to 11K. Have a plan when the price of BTC goes to 5K. What alts do you want. What does your exit strategy look like? Before you buy, always have an exit plan and consider all possibilities. Like i said before when you trade with a smaller stack, you are alot more comfortable to make bolder decisions. You don't have to **kill it** on each and every trade. You just have to protect your capitol, and sometimes that means cutting losses. In other words, trade gently, but if you are not trading now, start coming up with plans on what you want to do!
Edit: also learn to spot trends. If you miss out on a run , there's always a retracement. Every single damn day is an opportunity. Just because the price went +15% doesn't mean you screwed up. It means that you have to keep looking and scouting. In particular look how bull runs and bear dumps look like, and what they look like before, during, and after. There are stages to these things and you can spot them over time with a few months of practice. Don't even invest. Just watch the charts and learn. Put in $20 just to test. Try to turn your $20 into $25. You do not have to kill it on every trade.
For example. I missed out on the run from 9250 to 9377 just  now. I sold at even. I do not panic nor do i fomo, or regret selling at around my buy-in price. My goal was to cash out some alts and go back to fiat. I know there is  a retracement opportunity, and even if you miss one retracement, there are more coming. Each one with its own characteristics.
Here's a simple "trick". Set a stop buy that anticipates retracement because  you don't have to commit to anything, and you control the buy in price after its proven its strength. As an example you set a stop buy of BTC at 8950  after BTC goes to 9075. There's also shapes you need to recognize, flag, triangles, and of course, the shape of bull runs and bear drops. Runs / Drops occassionally look like vertical lines, but more often, they are bubbles along the way. Lower circles ('soggy bottoms') and upper circles  ('top bubbles') appear on movement up and down, and there are thus 4 types 
* lower circles + price up = strong movement 
* lower circles + price down = descending but keep an eye to buy soon 
* upper circles + price up = dampening movment upwards.. look to sell soon
* upper circles + price down = possible whale movement downwards! 
Also of course look for pre-volume pump (high volume , relatively small price movement).. Tons and tons of things you can learn every day.

I think one of the more interesting stories coming out of the Ripple ecology is SaldoMX, which allows one to buy a prepaid cash card in the US and send it to someone in Mexico as fiat currency without ACH or any ACH level fees. You buy it in $10 USD and the reciever literally gets $10 equivalent in Pesos without any cost. THat's revolutionary IMO. Gateway in the states, gateway in Mexico with a money transmitter there. The amazing thing about Ripple is that it blends perfectly with existing fiat currencies because it is a live FOREX marketplace first and foremost without ACH for transfers.

Ripple is not a coin. The non-value coin that is used on RIpple (XRP) is used to facilitate all transactions as a measure of network cost and spam-prevention.  That XRP is used as a cost of transaction and not another coin is up to Ripple; but it makes sense that its a coin that is based exclusively for use on the network. There's really no good reason for it to be another coin since you are only being charged really small amounts of XRP (way less than fractions of a penny) to conduct small transfers.

i think its rational. the value of a dollar to an individual is not 1-1 with a dollar. This is true for all people, rich or poor. Value is a measure of worth; in a free market where even our currency is based on other people's opinion of the fair market price, i think its entirely rational and that there is no bias.
