It's not the jury that decides what gets in or not as evidence. The legal term "evidence" has a lot of legal implications, so for that reason they leave what gets to be "evidence" or not up to the judges.

Any publicity is good publicity. Back in the 80's drug dealers used to buy their expensive cars with suitcases full of cash.

It's easier and cheaper these days for college students to either get a prescription themselves or buy it directly from their classmates.  
  
I'm not saying some MIT students won't spend it on drugs, but I'm sure many if not most of them will not. This spells opportunity for the 1-2% of those who want to target the MIT student market with something innovative. Come to think of it, it doesn't even have to student really. If I was a Thai restaurant on MIT campus right now, you'd better bet I'd be getting that "We accept bitcoin" sign up pronto.
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:24:56
So this techy nerd deeply involved in the darknet, who created and was running the site, was also selling drugs himself and kept everything unencrypted?  
  
Now I'm no law enforcement expert, but that sounds like an orgy of evidence to me. Even when I used to smoke pot, I'd go to buy a $20 bag and the guy I was buying from was more careful than that, and a lot of those dealers could barely spell their name let alone understand the technical aspects of multi-sig escrow. If I'm making money just based off commission why would I need to risk mailing and dealing with drugs myself? Once again their story makes no sense whatsoever.  
  
I'd *really* like to trust our government, but this whole "CIA runs the drug trade" thing is starting to sound more and more plausible.
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:21:58
Why not? The whole appeal of bitcoin is that it can't be regulated by some central source. This entire ordeal, regardless of your opinion on drugs, is a perfect proof-of-concept.

Who gets to decide what's "mumbo-jumbo" and what's not? I know a bit about TOR, but I know little to nothing about antitrust laws. I'm no moron but theoretically an attorney could present a bunch of antitrust "mumbo-jumbo" to me that spun the truth and I wouldn't know any better. Incidentally that doesn't mean I'm not qualified to serve on such a jury. We have to leave it up to the attorneys unfortunately. The system isn't perfect but it's about the best we've got right now.

Wrong. You're perfectly free to renounce your citizenship if you don't wish to pay taxes.

People who don't pay taxes are like those assholes who sneak into "$5 all-you-can drink keg parties" without paying, but drink the beer anyway. You live in this country, you enjoy the benefits, just pay your fucking share asshole.  
Not just that, but all these kids laughing about not paying taxes on bitcoin are going to be in for a big surprise when the IRS comes in and puts levies on their bank accounts and/or sends them to prison. You kids have no idea what you're dealing with. The IRS has scary amounts of enforcement power... power given to them by the people who DO pay taxes because we don't want to put up with assholes like you. If you think the government asks for too much money then get political and start telling our government to quit spending so much.    
You can damn well be sure I'll be paying my taxes on any gains via bitcoin. I'll be deducting costs too, such as internet, electricity, home office space, etc...  
  
Edit: I'd be willing to bet that half of these idiots support government social programs too. They ask the government to spend all this money and then complain when the bill arrives. When the economy collapses and your ISP goes out of business, what good are your bitcoins then?
@_date: 2013-07-02 04:03:46
How is that not worse than just buying actual bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:16:47
My point is that it is not extortion.  
Parable time. Imagine society as a playground. A group of kids get together and decide that want to build a slide to play on. One kid decides he doesn't want a slide, so he doesn't help out with any of the work.  
Once they finish building the slide though, the kid wants to play on it. The group decides to let him as long as he helps out with the next project. He agrees and uses the slide, but then again refuses to help out. So guess what would happen? The group would get together and kick the kid off the slide.  
My point is this: the group of kids are not trying to extort the other kid. The kid is just a lazy, spoiled asshole who should have just helped out in the first place. If he doesn't want a slide or to work on it, he's perfectly welcome to go play by himself in the corner.

I think you have a point here that I didn't really consider, but I still feel somewhat of a responsibility to "pay rent" if you will to enjoy the comforts that living in my country provides for me.  
I wonder if there is some way to charge people taxes based on their own political beliefs. You want to liberate Iraq? That'll cost you extra taxes. You think welfare is a good idea? That will cost you extra taxes. I think it would be really interesting to see how the political spectrum would change if people's paychecks had line items in them, as well as the ability to "opt out" (if that is even possible).
@_date: 2013-03-20 23:45:34
But I'm agreeing with you!
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:17:34
Touche. That's another topic though...
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:01:43
Not angry, I just have no problem calling out people's BS.  
Either personal property exists or it doesn't, you can't have it both ways. So why should I have to pay for anything then? Why pay for food or shelter? We live under an economic system where (theoretically, anyway), those who contribute the most to society can reap the most benefits. Is it a perfect system? No, but *we're doing the best we can.*
@_date: 2013-09-22 02:10:25
Oh, they can outlaw it, it just won't affect anything if they do.

Yeah, I don't get this. CoinLab comes out and basically says "Hey, MtGox ripped us off!" but yet somehow they're the bad guys for saying that?  
Maybe I missed something, I don't get it.

You don't know what you're talking about.  
I'm aware that the Federal Reserve is a private, run-for-profit corporation. The Federal Reserve is not "the government" though, and is not hording your tax money. If anything, they're lending the government money in order to pay for all these social programs that we can't afford. None of this means you aren't obligated to pay taxes like the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-09-21 21:30:14
Thanks, Piers.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:23:27
I agree, but we will probably need to fight to keep it that way. I can already see Piers Morgan going on and on every night about bitcoin and kiddie porn until some new laws get passed concerning digital currencies.

I'm not saying he wasn't involved, I'm just suggesting that maybe he wasn't the only one. Then again, maybe all these SR devs are on heroic doses of meth or something. They did get it all back up and running in 4 weeks...

I put in a small order last night and have yet to see any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:53:47
I don't think it's possible to "seize" bitcoins, unless those companies are just really stupid, in which case they probably could have just been stolen by other criminals anyway.

Not around here, but there are people stupid enough to watch him. These idiots also vote.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:27:24
We have a collective choice as to where the money goes. Agreement there is a bit more complicated than "I don't think I should pay for that so I won't". I don't have kids, so why should I have to pay for schools? That's rhetorical: even if I didn't agree that educating our kids is good for the entire public, I should still have to pay for it because I am reaping the benefits of that system.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:29:40
And wasn't this whole US-based Dwolla account thingie part of the complaints that CoinLab filed? Wonder if it's related.

Umm... I don't think that's how press releases work. Press releases are things that companies to do release previously "secret" information. Nothing is secret about bitcoin. Not to mention, there's no central authority (which is why we like bitcoin, right?) so who says you and/or your group of friends get to be the "bitcoin spokesperson"?  
I think bitcoin can speak for itself.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:46:06
If you're trying to convince me that there are criminal elements in the government you're preaching to the choir. That doesn't mean taxation is extortion.

I didn't think buying bitcoins was that difficult. Shorting sounds interesting, but I'm wondering what will happen if Wall Street floods $11 million worth of bitcoins with $100 million worth of cash. I'm no economist, but wouldn't that fuck shit up?

Sorry, I didn't realize I was speaking to such a vastly knowledgeable expert on public opinion on the internet! Please, tell me how can I be as smart and popular as you bitbutter?  
If you're really offended by my use of the phrase "fucking asshole", then either you're new to the internet, or you're trying to take some sort of faux holier-than-thou "I'm better than you because I don't swear" approach. If it is the latter, the difference between me and you is that at least when I'm being a condescending prick, I'm up front about it.  


  
I believe that society has a group interest in what is done with the environment that we share. I suppose if you assumed "society" was "the state" and "shared environment" was "property", you could come to that conclusion. By "what theory"? I'd say *common sense*. But yes, I suppose I could put some pseudo-intellectual name on it like "Geosh's theory of proprietary economics" and who knows... maybe even get a few suckers to buy a book or two.
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:22:55
Wow. The ignorance in this subreddit is astounding.  
Taxes do not just "go to the government". They go to the things that the government pays for, i.e. health care, social programs, law enforcement, military, etc. This money comes out of your paycheck and goes right back into the hands of other Americans, be them doctors, soldiers, government employees, Lockheed Martin employees or what-have-you. It's just a subversive form of socialism. The answer, however, is not to just quit paying taxes (seriously, that sounds like an idea that came from an angsty teenager). The solution is to eliminate the unneeded social programs.  
So no, you're way off. Libertarians who care about "making sure the government got its pound of flesh" are actually called *Libertarian socialists*... quite the opposite from any sort of Republican.

One thing is for sure, apparently DHS is now considering bitcoin usage in general as a criminal threat. I'm surprised they're getting away with this BS.

I assure you that the bars of the prison, built under the agreement of the rest of the public, and the jury of your peers that will vote to put you there if you do not pay your taxes like the rest of us, are in fact very real. Dare I say even moreso than bitcoins.

Here's the thing though: they didn't just seize the assets of, or turn off transfers for criminals. They did it for *everybody who was using Dwolla*.  
It sounds to me like they don't know who the criminals are, and so they're just treating every bitcoin user as a criminal, which is a clear violation of the 4th amendment.
