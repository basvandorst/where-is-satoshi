Just to jump in, that can be nearly impossible because both sides of the American political spectrum operate on a completely different base understanding of human nature which shapes the rest of the political philosophy they subscribe to. The American left has an unconstrained view of human nature; that it is malleable and can be shaped through external influences. The American right has a constrained view of human nature; that human nature is unchanging and external influences should not attempt to shape it differently. This is the fundamental divide even though most people do not consciously recognize it. British liberalism from the 18th century which spawned the American system was built on a constrained understanding of human nature, continental liberalism as in France was built on an unconstrained one.

Fiscal as in economic issues reflect this divide just as much. The constrained vision in economics is reflected in the attitude that people should stick to their niches of expertise and the economy will run itself. Smith and Hayek both talk about a constrained human nature a lot in their economic formulations. Unconstrained human nature in economic terms is the notion that economics needs to be dictated to a social end I.e the business that does what it does to provide a social benefit to the masses. Economic right is entrenched in the idea that human nature dictates how an economy should work, economic left thinks the economy should be built to shape a new human nature.

I think you mean a liberal democracy. There are too many structural problems in Venezuela for that to work well. There needs to be an intermediary government that can restore order and start building conditions for a healthy market. It could take a few decades
