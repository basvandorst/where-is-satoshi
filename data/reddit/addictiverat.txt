@_date: 2019-10-11 21:02:54
Then you fall asleep and realised 56 years on earth have passed, so you scramble to check your Ballance just to find out everyone moved to something else and you now have nothing so look at the history and weep for what you could have had...

I am sure he would... He would be really sad but the hookers, blow, fast cars, and everything else would help occupy his mind so time could heal
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:23:15
We have very different ideas about an "amazing experience" but if you're happy that's all that matters.

@_date: 2019-04-14 15:00:49
It really is! Happened to me once. I checked my portfolio seen everything I owned massively inflated. Heart raced hands shaking mind flying. About to call in to work sick (i was in the parking lot) started driving home to put in a sell order but before i hit my house i checked again.... Just absolutely sole crushing....
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:55:43

Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, continues to believe in Bitcoin and sees $ 9,000 in real terms as realistic for the year 2018. In his opinion, Bitcoin will reach new highs of over $ 20,000 next year as there will be an influx of institutional investors (freely translated):

Yes you should!
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:09:07
So.... That happened...
@_date: 2019-09-17 01:47:42
So in your last 7 days how is the 1.3% profits? ETH is at 11%... Oh yeah your ratio is now 69.2.. I've seen this time and time again. When an old timer suggests caution you may not want to mock him.
Rat out.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:18:41
Not trying to be an anti-bitcoiner but as an outsider looking in be careful...
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:40:25
And you will be again if you dont change your tone!
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:31:35
Its a scam. When you try to change the password and go back to it it will be the original password. Also if you attempt to move the crypto it will say you cant due to a minimum. They try to trick you into raising the Ballance so you can move all of it.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:15:44
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:25:42

@_date: 2018-12-08 13:24:11
I don't see $100 happen bud. There's too many people involved BUT if there was a massive hack/flaw or Satoshi moved his coins maybe and that would be people exiting out to other coins and fiat 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:32:33
Im messing with you don't give any one those words
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:11:13

Wow she looks beautiful. I hope she treats you right
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:51:03
Netflix needs a series of "how to hodl crypto" basically just a video of me sitting on couch randomly looking at blockfollio and randomly saying... Heh... Hmmm... Egh... Oh god i can't look.... Oh my god ��!.... Oh dear god no!.... Seriously CNBC?.... Then setting my phone down and watching TV again...
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:46:46

Please don't do that! It can roll off a cliff!
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:40:23
�� maybe... Anything could happen.... 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:03:17
Honestly i take this with a grain of salt BUT eventually those coins will move and when they do BTC is going to get hurt
