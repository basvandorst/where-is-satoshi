OK, I'm not sure what your point is.
Yes, states can be corrupt.  But a **black market** is just selling goods  which are against the law of your current state. Whether you agree with them or not.  It is not *fiction* when the police take you away.  Of course you can rebel... but selling illegal goods is the **black market** until you achieve victory or superiority to the controlling *'state'*.
I agree decentralized currency protects from the control of the state, as well as fiat currency manipulators.

Agreed, but that doesn't negate the fact that the remaining government  in whatever form has *'the Law'* behind them, and that technically the **black market** is operating outside the sanctioned legality of the government. 
Like look what's up with medical marijuana. It's technically illegal, &amp; sick people are forced to buy it on a *black market* in many states in the USA. We could argue that the state &amp; the war on drugs is criminal &amp; wrong...  But in the end the government makes the rules, crooks or not.
In Venezuela, the government still has the power to enforce laws even if they are corrupt. Hence *black market*.

**Original post** &gt; *To operate you had to buy US dollars on a* **black market** *or bribe a government official to exchange currency.*
Both of those sound illegal...  
The government controls the dollars, and still exists even if it has *failed* the people. That also doesn't mean there is no law enforcement, right. There are still rules being enforced even if poorly &amp; arbitrarily.  People are getting arrested for mining BTC...
Not trying to hassle ya, but this situation is about bitcoin's use as an alternate to state owned fiat currency, not about a failed attempt at what some were calling socialism but is obviously an oligarchy.

You seem to be missing some key ideas in your statements -
*'Here you imply that the black market is something opposed to "legitimate". ' *    
---  Black markets are **by definition** illegal &amp; illegitimate. That's what makes them ['black markets'] ( . . .
*"can afford to help feed their community" - Feel-good slogan, claiming a moral high-ground for committing self sacrifice.* 
-- How is helping to feed their family &amp; community a slogan. He's not saying they are better than everyone, just that they got lucky.
*"corrupt and incompetent governments" - blaming the actors as opposed to the ideology.
socialism has failed you* 
-- Venezuela is not socialism, it is an oligarchy, where the top eats &amp; throws scraps to the outliers. Trying to pin this on an ideology rather than economic sanctions, artificially low oil prices &amp; oligarchical system and a failed state, misses the point entirely.
*"the black market is it is a capitalists dream" - No, you are enduring the economic reality that is predicted by their theory. Capitalists dream of a government that protects individual freedoms and does nothing else.*  
--  Capitalism **does not** protect individual freedoms lol...  
Capitalism is based on economic growth despite the tendancies towards overconsumption, un-sustainabilty, and waste.  Captialism in the US goverment subverts individual freedoms all the time.  Rich people buy our laws &amp; subvert the will of the people all the time. **Citizens United** - Corporations are people? WTF? Plenty of examples of how this statement is dead wrong...
Seems like you just have an axe to grind against socialism. You might want to re-think your world view... Capitalism has good points, but as a sustainable unilateral system is as broken &amp; dead as communism. Greed is human nature  Captialism does not = ~~Freedom~~

Yo I didn't see you PM'd before I responded on post.
Cool mon, basically the state failed the people but still has law enforcement, and regulations regarding buying &amp; selling of currency.
Hence buying &amp; holding dollars is technically illegal &amp; punishable.
