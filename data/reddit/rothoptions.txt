Yes, at this point I would believe those coins to be gone. There’s no way someone is sitting on those without ever cashing ANY out. No one really knows though...pretty crazy there’s just $16B sitting there haha.

I actually just read that Finney claims he did not know Dorian personally. 
In my original comment I’m writing it in present tense to help explain my hypothetical scenario. I’m still not convinced they didn’t know each other, they lived a mile apart!

Oh yeah. One accelerator quoted me $115 to speed it up, fuck that.

Awesome thanks, didn’t even know those services existed

Copy and pasted from my other comment on this thread- but I think he has passed away:
I believe it was Hal Finney. First person to receive a bitcoin transaction. Lived a few blocks away from a man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto (who has claimed a million times that he is not the creator and doesn’t even know what bitcoin means). 
Finney knows Dorian personally- sees him as a common quiet man who is pretty harmless. Dorian has financial struggles and gets foreclosed on by the government, helps inspire Finney to use his name to kick off a revolution to keep the government out of money. 
Finney develops ALS in late 2009, rendering him to become less and less active with the community and to instead spend more time with his family. He passes away in 2014. 
Maybe I’m in too deep and should take my tinfoil hat off. But in my eyes, Finney is Satoshi.

Great question. Maybe he didn’t leave them with proper instruction on how to access them? Maybe they can access them and don’t want to sell any? Maybe they are on dozens of hard drives that he did not arrange to have been dealt with upon his death?
Not really sure on that question, I guess there could be lots of different reasons, there definitely isn’t an obvious one that sticks out to me though unfortunately.

Ah, the future of money
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:56:54
Yes that’s what I think. He did not want to be discovered 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:51:45
The possibilities are endless! Fun to theorize about, I’m confident that we will never know the answer for sure though.

In my opinion yes, I believe it was Hal Finney. First person to receive a bitcoin transaction. Lived a few blocks away from a man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto (who has claimed a million times that he is not the creator and doesn’t even know what bitcoin means). 
Finney knows Dorian personally- sees him as a common quiet man who is pretty harmless. Dorian has financial struggles and gets foreclosed on by the bank/government, helps inspire Finney to use his name to kick off a revolution to keep the bank/government out of money. 
Finney develops ALS in late 2009, rendering him to become less and less active with the community and to instead spend more time with his family. He passes away in 2014. 
Maybe I’m in too deep and should take my tinfoil hat off. But in my eyes, Finney is Satoshi. 
Edit: even if it’s not Hal Finney - can we acknowledge how wild it is that the first person to EVER receive a bitcoin transaction lived just a few blocks away from a man named Dorian (born name Satoshi) Nakamoto?!? That’d be a crazy coincidence 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:38:36
Yeah I read that as well. I’m not buying it though I think he just didn’t want all of the attention on his family. I mean it turned Dorian’s life into a nightmare once the media thought it was him, wouldn’t leave the poor guy alone

Why one earth would I pay $20 to send that $500 if I could just use Litecoin and pay $.02 instead, and have it confirmed in 2.5 minutes? Why bitcoin?

They lived in Temple City, population 36,000 outside LA. Google maps doesn’t give it a totally urban vibe, but idk I’ve never been there.  
I live in NYC, so yes, I’m aware you don’t know everyone within a one-mile radius. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:25:08
Aaaand it’s back. Weird...why would that even happen in the first place?
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:55:40
Or possibly passed away (ex. Hal Finney)

Ok, so I should probably keep it on Coinbase for the fork then? And I won’t need to do anything special in order to transfer to my Breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:16:30
Buying from Coinbase with a bank account still takes roughly a week to settle. I believe they are rolling out instant but it is not yet available to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:16:43
Okay thanks, fingers crossed

Awesome thanks! Will have to check those out also

Have you read the book Digital Gold? I’m reading it now, and I really like it. It doesn’t dive into the technical aspect as much but gives a great overview of the history, early companies/figureheads, crashes, and the original vision.
