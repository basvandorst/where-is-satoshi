I didn't know the devs themselves more or less founded Blockstream. 
Thanks for the headsup!

OP is spot on, and running a Bitcoin-over-Tor node is very valuable.
The more Tor Bitcoin nodes there are, the more robust and independent the Tor part of the network is. At some point, running entirely over Tor will be as good as running clearnet Bitcoin. Right now, with the stated 129 nodes, this isn't the case yet.
- With running over Tor, the user gains extra anonymity. It then isn't possible to correlate IPs with adresses. Running clearnet, this isn't simple (sybil attack), but with watching many nodes and clustering spent adresses over some time, one can already pinpoint IPs.
- Even just running a Bitcoin node on your IP, without a wallet at all, might get you in trouble at some time in some parts of the world. Governmental crackdown on Bitcoin would be one scenario, criminals hacking nodes another scenario, and a mob DDOS'ing IPs of nodes already happened when the blocksize debate was at its sad peak. The most benign scenario might be China blocking Bitcoin at their great firewall, as they do with many popular services already.
- Nodes running over both networks should be more resilient against attacks (sybil attack, again) and splits in the network, where one part of the network sees and builds on another subchain than the other. I'd like to know what would happen in such a case now, if the Bitcoin daemon receives differing data on the two connectiontypes? I suppose the longest chain wins, as always?
- Yes, more Tor nodes and more traffic over Tor is highly valuable for privacy, legitimacy and for whatever the future will throw at us. I consider the Tor project one of our sharpest weapons for privacy and electronic self defence.
I run a Tor relay and a Bitcoin node for several years now. As they are on different servers, I didn't get to route Bitcoin over Tor yet.
Will do so now, thank you for the wake up call, OP.

Did you forget the small detail that the hacker should surrender the stolen 120k Bitcoin? If not, that would be a horrible deal..
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:27:45
Another thing I don't quite grasp: Bitfinex lost 120k BTC. They deducted 36% of all assets to socialize the loss. So on paper, they took a lot of LTC, ETH, DRK and USD. Customer accounts now show higher BTC balances than they have left.
What happens once they run out of BTC? Where do they buy more, for the other assets they took? With a 5 digit volume of BTC to buy, this will surely affect all markets a lot? Where do they even try to handle that volume? On their own exchange? On others?
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:28:42


Insidertrading and frontrunning much?

@_date: 2016-08-11 15:20:42
That would make sense, right?
Still, BFX (the IOU "coin") traded around 40ct per dollar yesterday, and at 30ct right now. So customers apparently are believing more in a bitfinex repay than to reduce losses from 36% to 24%?

True. The hacker didn't get the 120k BTC via cracking Bitfinex accounts. If he had access to all Bitfinex systems, including userdata, he might try to use that info (username+password) to crack other exchange accounts and steal more from there.
All of this doesn't sound too far-fetched to me.
Bitfinex never commented on if the hacker had potential access to userdata, right?

The one killer argument against regular mixers: they do disconnect the inputs and outputs on the blockchain, but the mixing service knows the connections. Nevermind that the service can steal it all. That, combined with the pretty much guaranteed tainted outputs I receive, makes it a pretty bad deal in every regard.

@_date: 2016-08-15 18:57:42
I'm not deep into the Tor protocol. But I expect that you can't directly connect to an individual node or hidden service. All traffic goes through some layers or relaying nodes. And, at least for regular users, this route changes every ten minutes.
Compare an illegal (TM) website on the clearnet and on Tor - even three letter agencies are having a hard time attacking hidden services.
It all is better than one static IP, publicy known, with all traffic going through one ISP who is an easy target for whatever MITM attack they want to run on one user. The ISP might not even know about the attack.

The ugly part is that your collateral might change in value heavily.
Have a leveraged position open with BFX as collateral? Not going well, but still within your risk tolerance? Oh, the BFX exchange rate halved due to some random reason, oops. Guess what, that pushed your collateral too low. You were liquidated and lost it all, sorry. Might even be in absolute negative numbers now.
Oh, that's some neat setup for a chainreaction and meltdown too. With a chainreaction on two markets, which will easily speed each other up.
Edit: Like it or not, downvote as you want, a volatile collateral as "security" is asking for trouble.

I don't know if "my" Bitcoins were moved or not, but I had a lot of them on Bitfinex. I'm fine with socialized losses, no matter if I would have lost 0% or 100%. I am surprised about the plan, though: can Bitfinex repay the whole stolen sum? If not, why should they not be insolvent?

I just noticed that "everyone opening one more random channel" would in fact connect each node with two additional channels (on average). One the node starts, one another random node randomly pointed to it.
So, how many channels are there right now, with how many nodes? Is "every node opens another channel" significantly more channels?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:48:44
Actually, no. "It" doesn't wait for two weeks, but for 2048 blocks. If each block would take a week to find, it would take 2048 weeks at the same difficulty until it is adjusted.
Sounds bad? Let's fix that? bcash introduced that "fix", named "emergency difficulty adjustment", which caused awesome turbulence, was gamed by miners, let to bcash having some hundred thousand blocks ahead of bitcoin, and had to be hardforked-out again. Leading to a split and two bcash chains ^^

Semi-OT: what routes are we talking here? Why are both graphs approaching 100% failed routes pretty quick (at 12% and 62% removd nodes, respectively)? Shouldn't they creep in a more linear fashion towards 100%?
Like, if only few nodes are left, let's say 10%, and are in separate clusters, they still can find routes to each other?
Or is it something with "possible combinations grows quadratic with nodes", i.e. "failed routes grow quadratic with removal of nodes"?

**tether_is_fiat**, if you read this here:
thank you for your generosity. This changed a lot of things not just for Andreas - a great step in getting this community back to what it was, what it's supposed to be.
Still, we are talking a lot of money here. Amounts, where trouble can head your way. I would suggest you to shut down your twitter account. To check your history (it's a relatively new account) what information is public. Not link any other or new accounts to tether_is_fiat. To tumble any bitcoins that can be linked to either of those three transactions.
Why? People will assume you donated less than 10% of your coins. Meaning you would be a double-digit millionaire, with "anonymous" cash laying around. Compare that to crimes involving four-digit sums.. There's little to no real-life crime involved in Bitcoin, but I'd really, really hate to hear about you being the first example in a few years. The internet doesn't forget.

Great initiative. In fact it is my hope for more super wealthy individuals to come forward bootstrapping science, research, humanitarian development etc where necessary. And I have more hope on us nerds than the super wealthy from the old age :-)
Here's my suggestions:
**1) [Machine intelligence research Institute]( 
If you are not already mixed up between euphoria and existencial terror regarding AI, I'd suggest you to read [this]( essay. In fact, I'd prefer you to check out that essay instead of further reading this post, if you have to choose. It had a similarly huge impact on me as when I first dived into Bitcoin.
**2) [Parsemus Foundation](
Medical research, their project with the most attention being a cheap longterm reversible male contraception. If humanity survives 1) we'll need this soon :-)
**3) "Opensource CPU and Hardware"**
Sorry no link, maybe someone can chime in here. Intel and AMD CPUs contain microcontrollers with closed source software and access to memory, data and networking interfaces. An can't safely and securely be deactivated. As we need open source operation systems and software, we need open source hardware too. It's a disaster waiting to happen, and maybe alreay happening behind closed doors for years. There's [Talos]( building a POWER8 open hardware computer, but I don't know what state they are at nor if they are an NGO or "just" a for-profit company. I'd consider this a first-world luxury problem, compared to 1) and 2) though.
**4) [The PENG! collective]( 
They use clever media campaigns to fight the big guys. Like for example
* staging a peace prize ceremony for one of the biggest weapons exporters
* getting into a young-researchers competition by Shell, then "exploding" their machine live on stage spilling oil everywhere, shutting down the complete competition
* dropping flyers over NSA headquarters, billboards in view of the bureaus with "intel exit"
and a dozen more. It easily takes 6 months and more to prepare for those campaigns. I am in awe of their clever and funny campaigns, and how they engage right at the biggest supercorporations, national states and intelligence agencies. They are not exactly saving humanity as a whole, but work on making world a bit less evil. I think a donation with a fraction of your regular donations would help them out big time already.
Well, what more can I say than "thank you for doing your part". :-)

\- There is no secret, or hidden, or tight-knit, or conspiring community in Bitcoin. It is all open as open as it can be, spread over the entire world, using github (for code) and reddit (for discussion) most. You found this spot here, late. Check how it works here. The whole complex is blocksize, bcash and segwit2x by the way. \[There are scams, conspiracies, fraud etc in Bitcoin, but nothing remotely like you imagine it, the community secretly amassing and duping newbies pre-fork\]
\- The fork, and the debates and fights and worldwide conferences which led to the fork were the  topic for at least a year. It was the dominating topic literally everyevere. Many people considered it the biggest thing, debate, attack or upgrade ever in Bitcoin. There were articles about it \*everywhere\*.
\- It was completely unknown how it would turn out. You, in hindsight, seem it obvious the price would rise, and assume insiders took advantage of that and of newbies. No, absolutely not. Many expected it all to go down instead. That bcash would, with not adding anything useful to the crypto world, only take from Bitcoins value, and the turmoil and confusion and fighting reducing the value of the net sum of them both. This was even moreso with the non-happening segwit2x fork. 
And see, that's always the case where something is traded. It seems so obvious to one person the price will rise because of x, and that it is totally undervaluated. But then someone else assumes the opposite, and wants to get out. That's why there is a pair of sellers and buyers to begin with.
In many cases, especially Bitcoin, both conclusions make some sense. Often it comes down to really understanding the tech behind it, the long-term plan, experience, and \[fanatic\] trust.
Also, you asking people here "hey, then do the work and prove me with articles from before the fork" and "there are important aspects to this story I didn't tell, and will do later" and finally msome people feeling to be blamed, unfairly, creates more negative resonance to what happened to you than necessary.
Sorry for your loss.
My advice:
Learn about what you invest into. In the case of Bitcoin, even after years people still consider themselves newbies. Find a local Bitcoin community. Austria has a lot, check reddit, bitcointalk, [meetup.com]( etc.
When trading: only invest what you can afford to lose. Never, ever invest everything, there never is a valid reason to do that. Never. Especially for a "this looks bad temporarily, I just need to hang in". Always make a plan of what you expect to happen. If it happens, stick to your planned reaction, e.g. take out profits etc. If it goes against you, your plan failed. Have security nets in place, e.g. stop-loss orders, and stick to them.
Finally, welcome to r/bitcoin. Maybe start over with a fresh reddit account, and hang around here. This and bitcointalk are the biggest communities. Be careful with news sites, most of them are trash.
Keep a little sum in Bitcoin. Keep it offline, hodl. Stay away from altcoins. Many people say most, almost all, or even all altcoins are technically worthless or outright scams.

Interesting project.
Dedicated hardware for cold storage is a great way to enhance securty.
Howver, I don't like bluetooth as a communication channel: if someone uses a dedicated smartphone for the vault, it probably is an older, outdated smartphone. A lot of outdated smartphones, otherwise perfectly fine for a vault, have a hackable bluetooth service. So especially when dealing with bitcoin, I don't want to ever activate bluetooth on that phone again.
How about, instead, using QR codes, or a QR-code-"flicker" (think animated QR code) and the camera to transfer the data?
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:35:57
That's why I suggested a "flicker" qr code. Like, an animated gif with several qr codes, 3kb each for example. You could even reduce redundancy in the encoding to the minimum, as the display and camera won't have much noise or damage.
Or, get creative and use several colors, each doubling the data transported per qr code.

[this]( and [that]( from 2017 and 2018 respectively, the latter explicitely targeting BLE.
These hack the entire phone, so the attacker would have access to the private keys on the vault side as well. And could, of course, hack the onlibe phone too, over bluetooth or a hypothetical bug to exploit the wallet from the vault. And finally use the online wallet to send the privkeys home.
Obviously the encryption of BLE between the two devices is meaningless here.

Of course I'm days late and my "entry" might be too controversial anyway:
The PENG! collective:
They use clever media campaigns to fight the big guys. Like for example
* staging a peace prize ceremony for one of the biggest weapons exporters
* getting into a young-researchers competition by Shell, then "exploding" their machine live on stage spilling oil everywhere, shutting down the complete competition
* dropping flyers over NSA headquarters, billboards in view of the bureaus with "intel exit"
and a dozen more. It easily takes 6 months and more to prepare for those campaigns. Not surprisingly, they are dependent on donations:
I am in awe of their clever and funny campaigns, and how they engage right at the biggest supercorporations, national states and intelligence agencies.

I'd like to add that an updated, current plot would also have a big red area for the last weeks and months of the time. And the red area visible in 2013 would be gone, or better said, moved forward. Simply because Bitcoin, as a currency, is being transferred regularly. At least a big part of it. If it turns out differently on an updated image, it would mean there is more hoarding and less usage.

Nope, you are mature. You didn't spend it on gaminghardware, cartuning, coke, whatever. That makes you more mature than many so-called adults.
Also, it takes more than just "I heard about bitcoin in the year xy". Need to hear of it, need to find it interesting enough to look at it, need to actually look at it, need to understand the concept, need to actually like the concept. And only then we can talk about if that person has money, and the possibility to buy bitcoins. Oh, and holding on to the coins even though the exchange rate goes insanely up and insanely down.

I like your positive attitude.
Yes, in the end, after all is said and done, one could say "technology won", as good technology won't go away again, no matter what the lawmakers say. Yes, I believe Bitcoin and the Blockchain won't go away again, no matter what.
Still, the banhammer would change everything. This would make transacting or trading coins an experience similar to handling marjihuana (where it still is illegal). Marjihuana certainly won't go away any time soon, but I'd rather have Bitcoin be as present and normal as tobacco than as marjihuana (Nah, more than tobacco, please).
And then, of course, the pressure or advantage to use Bitcoin isn't that high for most of the people reading this reddit today, for example. Illegal drugs or p2p-filesharing are, were, gamechangers, where people are motivated enough to jump through hoops. And those depend much less on the network effect than currencies.
The good thing is, the development is so fast, we can sit back and watch how it turns out. Better yet, not sit back, but get involved.
Same with encryption, in a bad way. I don't see a widespread use of encryption should it ever become banned (as nonsensical as this would be). If rooting/jailbreaking your phone is needed, if less than 1% of your contacts have PGP keys, who would bother except a minuscule minority? This is already a problem today, without crypto being banned. If the big ones like Apple wouldn't help (seemingly?), crypto would be as little used as it has been for decades.
Seems like I'm having a pessimistic day here.

This would not solve the problem at all.
When you have more bandwith than the "blockchain bandwith", a shipped hdd makes the progress just faster. But you would sync all up eventually.
When you have less bandwith, you will get left behind anyway.
When you have exactly the same bandwith, even a one-hour break where your computer is offline, or the hour between sending and receiving the shipped hdd, will be impossible to fetch up.
Maybe the broadcasted blockchain can help out here!

I wouldn't call it all off just yet.
Regular wifi hardware can cover many times more than 13km with the right (directional) antenna.
Here, we only need a very sensitive receiving antenna, as we don't necessarily need to send to the bugged device. Put the antenna wire into the usb cable, use specialized hardware, a non-standard (empty) frequency, ignore all transmission rules and laws, and use an expensive-as-hell receiver.
I guess it's possible. That's why one of those USB thingies costs 1k USD, I'd say.

Yes. Pruned nodes look like a full node to the user (p2p, block validation, private keys), but doesn't "help" the p2p as a full node.

Ukraine's largest commercial bank, Privatbank, announced temporary
limits on cash withdrawals for its account holders and suspended writing
new loans, saying in a statement the measures were intended to stop
those undermining the political situation in the country. "A temporary
limit on withdrawals is needed to stop the forces that are working to
destabilize the situation [and] are using the cash for [their]
sabotage," the bank said in a statement. The bank didn't clarify which
political forces it was referring to.
The bank first announced withdrawal limits of 1,000 hryvnia ($103) a
day at both automated teller machines and in over-the-counter transactions.
    ...
Privatbank's announcement was the first case in which a major
Ukrainian bank has limited customers' immediate access to cash in the
local currency since the military tensions erupted. Privatbank is the
largest retail bank by number of clients in Ukraine, a country of
approximately 45 million people.
Last week, the National Bank of Ukraine introduced a $1,500 daily
limit on foreign-currency withdrawal.

You could call it a "micro bounty" system.

I would put a clear bounty sum to my problem. Optionally on escrow too, as some "micro bounties" might border to "full bounties", where people working on my task want to make sure there is funds secured for their work.
In some places it's frowned upon to bid or ask for monetary incentives. But then, some times I need help *right now*, need the problem fixed in the next hours, and would gladly pay for it. But wouldn't want to spend half of the time to find the appropriate place or support company, signing up, transferring money the old way and so on.
Heck, people could have several categories, from "fiverr" to "IT help" to "medical help". Whenever people need reliable, quick help, in what field whatsoever, they'll come to you! :-)

Well, with a symmetric key, you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt. When the malware sends that key to the c&amp;c, and it is intercepted, it's game over for ranson.
Sure, the communication could be encrypted. How? Symmetrical, or asymmetrical? ;-)
If the malware has a list of public keys (BIP0032 anyone?) and starts encrypting, the victim has no chance. Even when shutting the malware down, controlling all internet traffic in cleartext and having full read access to the whole RAM, it's not possible to decrypt the data. The malware wouldn't even have to phone home to the c&amp;c server ever, if designed that way.
Now I want to see someone defeat such malware! The c&amp;c server can be pretty watertight as well. Tor (compare how long SR survived) or use the botnet as your own anonymizing network.

Well, obviously the peso isn't worthless, as I still can pay my rent, tax and bananas with it. The problem is "only" that the value melts away in days.. So, in theory, it shouldn't be difficult to have a system where one exchanges his pesos for bitcoin, and switches back to pesos on short notice when paying stuff.
At least it shouldn't be a problem of liquidity?
This might turn out better than a "full bitcoin economy", where exchanging back and forth isn't needed anymore. In that scenario, liquidity would go down to zero, as this would need an influx of bitcoins, and therefore a corresponding outflux of pesos or other wealth in exchange.

I believe namecoin is good enough. Adding it to firefox or the operating system isn't that difficult. But as every user has to manually add it, it has a severe, maybe fatal hurdle for mass adoption.
Even among techies it's so unpopular, uunused, that it's a far way from a tipping point..

No. I don't need to stop the USB trojan before it owns my system. As soon as I realize the USB device is malicious, I unplug it, unplug my network cable and start disaster recovery or whatever.
I now, however, know that device is evil. I may analyze it myself, or send it to some smart people, or make a list what 'friends' used it. After that, that kind of USB attack vector will probably be closed: "don't buy that kind of device", "don't trust that vendor", "block any device with that ID", "change this and that path and variable in your OS". This device would be burned within a few uses and worthless.

Nah, not at all. The info, trace, isn't all public, but combining the knowledge of both involved exchanges gives a gapless record.
Bitcoin isn't anonymous. Not at all. Pseudonymous, and that can be a bitch.
Those large sums don't help neither.
But yeah, better than nothing.

The original 8 digit length was a (somewhat) arbitrary decision. To reduce the blocksize the smallest effective sum one can send is now higher than one satoshi. Still, again, an arbitrary decision. When it makes sense, for example when the exchange rate is that high, or ultrapruning is active, the limit can be set at 10 digits, or 12, or whatever. It's a tiny protocol change and a no-brainer too. I see no problems in here. For now, even a hundred satoshis are such a slamm amount of wealth, we have no fiat counterpart, and probably a hard time finding a real life object that inexpensive. Maybe a few grains of sand.
I got 99 problems, but too large "minimum bitcoin amount" aint' one!

I fully agree on the OPs concept. If "they" want to do this, they can do it. It's just laws, after all. It doesn't cost them money, but integrates Bitcoin into the taxable system.
It will be the "lets control, sniff, filter the internet" all over again:
- Make a huge smear campain (for free): Terrorism, child abuse [drugs] etc
- Companies/ISPs [exchanges + commerce] are forced to control all traffic, matching against lists of illegal urls [non-registered addresses]
- Punish those companies for failing, punish the individual
Yes, of course, that would be only in some contries, at the beginning, and probably won't be established in all countries worldwide. Which doesn't help me in *my* country at all:
- I can't buy at Amazonbay with my black coins
- I can't use "registered money", like from my bankaccount, to buy black bitcoins
- I can't buy mining gear without registering (if outlawed)
So, basically, I have difficulties to enter the system anonymously, and my uses for black coins are greatly reduced.
And, come on, people, this system is the wet dream of all those control freaks in power. Completely transparent (but only for the people with the registration database), frictionless and simple to tax, greatly reducing the amount of cash, fully digital.
And, I repeat it: It happened with "free internet" already. It happened quick. It happened in most western countries in unison. Some countries trashed that again (Germany), others still have that infrastructure and laws (Australia? UK?).
And here, in this case, this touches the very core of the power of governments and financial elite. Bitcoin, as it is now, does shake up the very base of "their" power.
People, stay vigilant.

You could say the same about firearms. "It's impossible for a government to control all firearms!"? In probably most countries selling arms anonymously is forbitten, and the shop owner will be in hefty trouble for this. Arms blackmarket is very expensive, and you can't easily resell your anonymous/unregistered/illegal gun. I don't think the government has to spend a lot of money to achieve this, the arms shops pay for this.
Now imagine Bitcoin replaced a lot of the day-by-day cash. Cash is replaced a lot already in the US and in some scandinavian countries. With Bitcoin, it'll be trivial to follow every single transaction. No banks any more who themselves are shady and not documenting what they are up to.
"Accurate database"? That's ridiculously simple: A spreadsheet with the address and it's registered owner. As soon as funds go from a registered to an unregistered address, an automated letter is sent to either get the new address registered, or pay 50% tax on the sum + misdemeanor. After three such cases your shop is closed, and individuals receive the "premium nagging program".
Of course all regular "known to known" transactions are taxed. Please pay 10% for all tx in your name at the end of the year, here's your tax address, thankyou.
With such a simple, yet highly profitable system, a government doesn't even waste a thought on black coins. They will slowly diffuse to white coins by themselves. Every gangster who works with black coins, such profitable, will eventually want to wash them (which then isn't a crime any more?) to white coins to buy his car and house.
Okay guys. I think this is what they will try to do. It's simple, effective, cheap, profitable. It's the obvious way to control Bitcoin. And, after that transition, they have ultimately more control over money, taxes, finance and individuals than now.

I agree completely on "box hacked, game over" as well as "security and crypto are hard".
I use an encrypted rar inside a keepass DB since I trust its encryption and it is widespread software. I need to decrypt that rar once, twice a year. So I won't lose that content as soon as my keepass DB is lost. And hopefully I notice that before I decrypt that rar..
Several keepass-DBs would be more secure, but much more of a hassle. Now, I have one file (keepass DB) to take care of (spreading and syncronizing backups). Several individual files would be a no-go. Yes, I could stack another DB in my main DB..
About writing stuff to HDD:
I run Linux, and have /tmp (and logs and some more) on a ramdrive. This is supposed to be faster and reduce wear on my HDD. Also, no temporary files go to HDD (hopefully). When unrar-ing those things I do it in /tmp, and after the next reboot it's gone.
That ramdisk stuff is nothing more than one line in fstab. with todays ram prices, I suggest that to every Linux user. Should be possible on other OS too.
And I fully agree to what I read between your lines: security is fckn tough. It's no product, it's a status. Which you have to nurse constantly.

The limiting factor with the blockchain probably won't be the storage size (20gb), but the minimum needed bandwith (500k in 10 mins average).

Sounds good so far!
When for some reason using the naked private key to transfer funds, instead the full wallet, you easily lose funds going to the (not backed up) change address.
This could especially happen when you use several paper wallets or several naked keys or the like.

There's a general problem with all passwordmanagers:
Normally, one would put all passwords and sensitive data in there. forum logins, Bitcoin keys, bankaccountlogin, everything. Why not, it's encrypted with a million bits!
Now with all your stuff in there, you probably open up the file on a daily case, to enter some random password in some random service. Every time you do that, your password can be keylogged, or some malware steals the complete database right out of ram. Including all stuff, including all Bitcoin keys.
The solution would be different password files (or one password file) with several different passwords. I don't know if, what passwordmanagers do such a thing.
Better encrypt your *very* valuable things before you put them in your daily-use passwordfile, for example putting it in a password-encrypted rar archive (good encryption, compatible with virtually every computer you'll find).

I looked over the wiki for a while.
Does someone care to answer a few answers I have left?
* is Project Meshnet a network layer, like ethernet or i2p? Or is there something "running" on the nodes, like mail, web, torrent or whatnot?
* How about anonymity? Something like onion routing, or is it plaintext, or simple end-to-end encryption?
* What do individual nodes bring in? Their own used bandwith? Bandwith for all, like TOR relays? Unencrypted content from others? Encrypted diskspace for decentralized content?
On another note, there's freifunk. Anyone cares to lay out the biggest differences?

I guess some aspects of the network will have to be paid:
- will bit451 use bitcoin, be coin-agnostic, or use its own altcoin? (as I understood it, coin-agnostic)
- will "just" content have its price, or will traffic and/or storage produce costs/income too? Maidsafe comes to mind here, and I personally like the concept of bitcloud (which you briefly mentioned too).
- is the anonymity concept comparable to TOR? (nested routing and encryption)

You know what's funny? On blockchain.info the 1bitcoineater address is tagged as "holgero". The normal way to tag an address is to sign a message with its private key. Which implies someone has its private key. Which means it's possible to reverse calculate private keys from public keys. Which means Bitcoin, as a protocol, is broken.
Or, just maybe, blockchain.info tagged that address themselves :-)

Old versions of Armory needed a hell lot of ram. That changed, now a regular computer is fine.
When did you try Armory? Perhaps it's been a while?
And yes, the initial blockchain download and validation are ressource hungry. Once that's done, Armory behaves itself.

It's trustless in case it does what it pretends to do. I won't read the sourcecode, so I don't know what it does. I don't know if it will load a malicious module later.
I don't know what my software does under its hood in 99% of the cases. But it's a difference if the software is a thumbnail creator or a tool where I pour money in. And it's a difference if the author stays anonymous for no convincing reason.

Great, that's a much needed app!
I have three requirements for such a ticker:
- at least BitStamp, the biggest three sounds reasonable
- alarms: at least "700$&gt;alarm&gt;1000$", better "+-10% in xy minutes"
- "push" notifications: only produce data traffic when the server alerts me of, well, an alarm
Hmm, a 1kb refresh every 5 mins means only 8mb per month. I could live with that, even without push notifications!

You still have many anonymity problems.
- I transfer 7.14219 BTC to the zerocoin sidechain
- Some stuff happens in the sidechain, anonymously, invisible
- some minutes, hours, blocks later 7.14219 BTC are transferred from the zerocoin sidechain to a new, random BTC address
- you just lost all anonymity
..even splitting it up into several transactions, addresses, joins, whatever, makes it only somewhat more difficult to uncover the whole process.

Good! I believe a good POS is strongly needed!
- where are the keys? Onlineservice, POS, Paperwallet etc?
- what hardware do you have in mind? Is it platform-dependend?
- what happens with several customers in parallel? Like, in rush hours, where you (would want to) create the next bill/qr-code while the previous customer is still fiddling with his wallet?
Good luck on this!
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:39:47
You are right. Doing this evil plan now would fail. That's why, if done correctly, they first wait until Bitcoin had its tipping point, and is strongly built in into the economy and userbase.
To a degree like Paypal, maybe. Paypal abuses its power big time, forcing US law over other countries and cutting off legit companies and organisations from their money. Paypal was founded 1998. Bitcoin might have that market share much quicker, for various reasons.

I like localbitcoins. It is the 'missing link' between the (failing or endangered) central exchanges and the (still being developed) completely decentralized exchanges.

You forget to mention how this should be done, practically.
It only works with more money flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Fiat, that is. We, Bitcoiners, which are already invested in Bitcoin, can't do much at all. To spark a bubble, you need more fiat, not more Bitcoins. That's why Bitcoiners can spark an etherium bubble, but not a Bitcoin bubble.
What do you propose?
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:38:26
No offence intended, but personally I am careful using BIP0038. The reason to have a physical backup is to not having to care about digital security, and having a fool-proof failback should all digital data and backups become unavailable.
Now when adding a (BIP0038) password, you either use a weak human-rememberable password, stick the password via post-it to the original paperwallet, or end up with digital data again.
The paperbackup relies on physical security. It shouldn't have top rely on additional security. I can't imagine many worse scenarios than me being run over by a bus and my family ending up with an encrypted paperwallet with no idea of its password.
There are valid and clever scenarios where BIP0038 is a gift. But it's no silver bullet.

Those HSM are not like a "paperwallet", but more like an "offline computer", as crude comparisons. So they don't just spit out the signed tx, but can have internal rules:
- only 100 BTC max per day
- only if the receiving address is whitelisted
- only if the checksum of the date ends with 7

Sorry for sounding a bit harsh before.
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:01:42
Nope, Armory doesn't need bitcoin-core to be installed. With Armory alone, you don't need those two blockchain folders and need only a minimum of ram. You won't have connectivity, but it's the common and highly secure scenario for an Armory cold wallet, where this offline Armory signs transactions it receives from another (online) Armory via USB stick.
For regular use, where Armory has the wallets, private keys and manages the accounting, yes, it needs bitcoin-core.

The linked post told nothing, and sounds lurid and excessive.
From the post and Gavins reply I conclude that those "faked PGP keys" are just keys which someone else uploaded to the keyservers, in the name of Gavin and the TOR dev.
Of course this is possible, and PGP/GPG doesn't have any mechanism against that (that I can see).
It boils down to "where did I learn of the public key of Gavin?". If you got a mail with the public key, this can easily be spoofed and faked.
If you downlaoded it from both bitcoin.org and GIT, and made sure they both show the same, you are quite sure against simple phishing attacks.
You are absolutely not safe from three-letter-agencies. Those might have bugged Gavins computer. Or they extorted the key from him. Or they replaced the keys on both servers. Or they replace the keys on-the-fly while you download them. Or they bugged your computer.
And this is why I say the original linked post sounds lurid and excessive. Simply because GPG is no silver bullet against a determined attacker.

I think Piper's post sums it up good!
The only other benefit I can think of right now is micropayments. A whole new business opportunity where the customer pays sub-$ amounts for one-hour-access, or xy megabyte downloads or the like. Doesn't sound that gamechanger, but it's simply not possible with the old payment systems.
Bonus points: Research the state of browser integration. I believe there are several teams working on this. Then let the company invest in them, sponsor them, team up with them, whatever. The real breakthrough will be when it's literally just one mouseclick to pay 0.99$ (anonymously and with no danger of recurring bills) to watch that hot babe!

Yes, like so many things in Bitcoin, Armory is "beta". Still, Armory is more stable in its "test beta" than many other "beta" or "release" projects. And even when the GUI missbehaves, Alan is *very* conservative with critical components like the wallet format. It hasn't changed in years, and no single incident is known where someone made a backup and still lost funds through Armory.

First off, thank you Theymos for having a public discussion on this.
Yes, the donation option isn't needed any more and can be removed.
I believe this subreddit doesn't need any big ad campaigns any more. And using big money on advertising Bitcoin in general feels like a waste indeed.
This is some serious money here - do something big!
In the sense of open source and community, I would create a bounty platform with this as seed money. Bounty projects are community voted and released open source.
Or something with lawyers, the EFF, or a charity fund which manages, maybe enlarges, and donates where it sees fit.

Armory uses bitcoin-core (aka bitcoin-qt aka bitcoind) as its network-connecting backend. That means that Armory itself doesn't download anything itself [except when it now speeds up the bitcoin-core download via signed bittorrent]. 
You can launch Armory even when bitcoin-core (aka bitcoin-qt aka bitcoind) isn't fully synced yet. Or isn't even installed, for that matter.
Armory will then be in "offline mode", where you can manage wallets, sign offline transactions and other stuff.

States which have no own currency (some southamerican states use the USD). Or some with very high inflation. Although the very same people who decide to use Bitcoin as their new currency are the ones who created the inflation in the first place..
Or the Bitcoin adoption is so high (inflation, again? Or people fed up of the restrictions?) that it already is the de-facto currency, and some smart politician just gives in..
I agree, all those are a long shot.

I agree, splitting it up onto, for example, 10 addresses, is a good idea.
Also, you could boot from a linux live cd. Then it doesn't matter what OS or virii are on the harddrive. You could even use your regular computer that way, unplugging the network cable and not entering a wifi password.
And, finally: make sure you understand the implications of "change addresses" when using a paper wallet. You will lose funds otherwise.

They don't have to mess with the miners directly.
They only watch the addresses and transactions.
They start enforcing this with (already legally registered) companies. From then on it spreads like a virus, via white coins, registered addresses and registered companies and individuals. When the tipping point comes, where most of coins OR shops OR miners OR individuals are registered, it will be very difficult to use bitcoins on an everyday base without registering yourself.

Well, it could only have been some app you installed. You would know which one, and we would have heard of it.
Also, "attacking keys" happens offline. The first sign you would see that your keys are under attack, is that your funds are transferred away. Also, it's not like "your keys are under attack", but all keys in existance are under attack simultaneously. ..which is only a problem if someone has a weak brainwallet.

Well, that's the point of exploits, to compromise the system with no user action. Once you own the system, it's trivial to manipulate the logs as well.
USB actually is a good way to infect a system. There are so many USB devices, with built-in drivers, only one of those needs a bug or backdoor. USB printer? USB weather station? USB sports accessories? LEGO mindstorms? Only one of them needs a hole..
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:20:30
Exactly that.
A private key allows you to send funds.
An address allows you to receive funds, and allows everybody to see all transactions. It's not possible to transfer funds with only knowing the address, and it's not possible to calculate the private key from the address.

The question is not "where did the coins go", but "when did the coins go". One theory says that mtgox was insolvent since 2011. And ever since tried to make up for it in fees. But with the exchange rate growing some magnitudes in the mean time, and their debt in Bitcoin, it was impossible to catch up. Throw in some bad exchange-rate predictions on top maybe.
It all started to implode once the liquidity wasn't enough to honor all withdrawals. Chain-reaction, bankrun, game over.
Yet another theory assumes the funds are still there, confiscated, with MtGox being forced to not tell the story behind this. That one looks very unlikely by now, though.

To make this process less "raw", use Armory!

Relays? Not exit nodes, or maybe entry nodes, but in-the-middle-relays? That would be very scary. All traffic to and from them is encrypted, so they couldn't be seized for the data they transfer. They would have been seized for partizipating in the Tor network then?

"The best of the best of the best, sir! With honor!"
It depends. If you can generate the paperwallet securely, it's a good thing. Like, booting with a (generic!) Linux live cd, using a trusted paperwallet-generator from usb-stick, and using a dumb (non-HDD) printer to print it out.
Make paper- and file copies and backups, while you're at it.
Spread the encrypted backups as much as reasonably possible.
Have some plans for what happens to the coins should you not be able to collect them any more.
You see, security is not a product (paperwallet), but a system. Which is only as secure as its weakest link, and needs more than single-time attention.
I do use paperwallets.

10% of the network failing is not a big deal compared to the complete network failing, even when the 10% failing happens much more often.
When 20% of the network drop out, because of DDOS for example, the remaining of the network is 100%. This happened already in the past.
No, miners are not all of it. When clients stop accepting and forwarding certain or all transactions or blocks, we're in trouble. Depending on how many of the clients do this.  This happened already in the past.
The protocol core wasn't changed much lately, and is only changed quite conservately. There's so much more potential for trouble in the individual implementation than in the protocol core rules!
I can live with bugs, downtimes and trouble in my linux kernel. There's no direct money at stake here. Bitcoin is a whole different animal.

Also, we need more client and node implementations! Remember the blockchain fork earlier in 2013? That wouldn't have been a problem at all, if there was a heterogenous Bitcoin landscape. If any client implementation has a bug, and it only has a small share of all nodes, only its users have a small and temporary problem.
People concerned about a mining 51% attack probably should be concerned about the nodes situation too.

Well, using Armory I feel reasonably secure, as Armory collects several sources of pseudorandom input and XORs them all. If only one of the inputs is good, the whole thing is good.

@_date: 2014-03-31 17:56:50

Technically, yes, it works.
The average time a user looks at a website is 3 sec. You will therefore lose like 90% of all users, even if they literally just have to do one click to install that plugin.
Also, I, as a security-conscious user, would have to read up minutes before doing that click (wouldn't I already know namecoin). I would be proud of my mom if she outright refused to do that one click, no matter what (and I think she would).

The most manipulation in gold is, as I understand it, with "paper gold". Non-backed gold option papers. They can, guess, what, print as many of them as they want, and sell them, to lower the gold price. Now, there' a considerable gap between gold and "paper gold".
Somehow that was similar to the last stages of Gox. There were no BTC on Gox, but BTC-options, aka GoxCoins.

The network knows the offline address in the moment someone transfers funds to it. Until then, noone needs to know that someone owns this empty address.
Also, I'd suggest to use a linux live cd. shut down the computer afterwards, voilá, all data from that session is gone (as it never was on the HDD to begin with).

- you send to their registered address, all fine.
- they send those white coins to an unregistered address: our gov won't do anything to them, except drop their address from the list. They don't care. But you, suddenly, can't send to them any more.

That's my impression too.
- you either have the alt-coin pegged to BTC, then it doesn't make much of a difference to have a sidechain. colored coins does most of this already?
- you have some kind of a floating rate, then the alt-coin-coins have different value

In a more general question, in what scenario could an infected online-wallet-computer infect or mess with the offline computer through qr codes?
Can the "qr-decrypting, parsing and escaping" part of the software be programmed that clean and readable that it's close to impossible to have holes in there?
Can it even be programmed in a "provably secure" manner maybe?

I too believe this war will be fought over the public opinion.
It will be intense: the 'status quo' controls the media, one of the most powerful weapons there is. The 'peasants', however, are growing ever more vary of banks and what the 'high economy' fabricates and tells.
As I see it, society is somewhat divided into "what's on tv today?" and "come on, all those statistics and numbers are bs!".
I am very curious how this will play along.

I'll name the last two candles "1" and "2", with "2" being the last one on that chart.
"1" closed at 479. Then "2" began. The first trade in the new timeframe for "2" was at 482.50. Then, at the end of this timeframe/candle "2", the last trade was at 481.50. Therefore, the candle "2" went from 482.50 to 481.50 and is red.
This isn't intuitive, and I was scratching my head at this one as well. I always assumed candlestick charts work as candlestickHLC do. And I believe in the past they did, at bitcoincharts.

I love it, neat!
Some general notes on any POS, not restricted to yours:
* It should be difficult to steal funds by replacing the Bitcoin addresses or the exchange/paymentprovider account. It should, however, be simple to verify a payment arrived. Maybe have a second device for feedback on received payments? A smartphone which makes a "ka-tschingg!" sound on every received payment. Bartenders, customers and press just love the ka-tschingg! of the schildback wallet!
* At busy times there are a dozen people paying at the same time, messing with their phones, some of them being offline unknowingly and all. I see it as the most important feature of any Bitcoin POS to be quick to use, easy to learn, and most importantly, somewhat parallel-able. This is a proble with most smartphone/tablet/wallet solutions I saw in action. No idea how this works out with your direct terminal integration though, maybe this isn't even a point.
* Some bars have several waiters, with a portable POS each. That's not the target here, obviously.
I agree to the other commenters: This project has so much potential! Do it! Is it's aesily adaptable (is OPI common?), this thing will be da bomb!

There are three ways those private keys can get into the hands of someone, be it a hacker or the bitaddress.org team:
* there is a direct internet connection. Be it the bitaddress page, malware on the computer, or the printer.
* the keys are leaked, known even before you create them. This could happen malicious with a deterministc random number generator (RNG), where someone can reproduce all (offline!) generated keys. 
* the RNG (of the OS) is not "random" at all because of a backdoor (NSA works on this) or a flaw. The latter happened on android, people lost coins because of this.
I personally don't believe bitaddress has malicious code in the scripts. And I am very sure that if all RNGs are "backdoored", which I wouldn't find *too* far a stretch to believe, "they" wouldn't risk it being exposed for some Bitcoins. Not even for *all* Bitcoins at once.
So, it depends -like always- on the sums involved. Larger investments warrant larger security. There is no strict separation between "security" and "paranoia", yknow?

Nope. Dust transactions aren't even relayed, so your dust transaction never reaches a miner to be included. And miners wouldn't include it anyway.
There are micro-transactions services, but those are off-the-blockchain. You collect enough dust in your onlinewallet, and once all the dust is over the treshold, you can do a real blockchain transaction to any bitcoin address.

Or another ARM-based box, a bit more powerful than a RasPi, with a Linux router/firewall distribution, which may also serve VPN access and files, while at it.

Central server for finding your buddies, yes, but the message encryption is end-to-end, with the keys only on the mobile phones. So the central servers can't see more than anyone else wiretapping the data.
The software isn't complete open source, right. The encryption library is open source. You can encrypt a message with the open-source library, and will receive the exact encrypted data that the client on your phone generates too when you give it the same message.

I hear you, I like both networks too :-)
For Tor, I would say (non-exit) relays help the network a lot. We don't need that many exit-nodes, as they are publicly known and under surveillance/legal fire anyway.
For Bitcoin, I think it helps the most to have stable Tor-clearnet bridges. We don't strictly need a Torified Bitcoin network today, but it always helps to have experience when it turns out to be needed. As I understand it, there aren't many Tor-Bitcoin nodes altogether. With no bridges, they effectively are offline. There will be few bridges, and even less stable, 24/7 running bridges.
So I think it's both the best for you personally as well as for the Tor and the Bitcoin network to run a (non-exit) relay and a Tor-Clearnet-Bitcoinbridge. That's the conclusion for me at least.
I didn't read up on how to configure bitcoind to do this. Does anyone have any pointers for this?

I'm not 100% sure how you mean the OP: do you say there is a direct link in the blockchain between the "100 in" and "1 out"? There is not. The point is that the accounting happens off the chain. 500 addresses with bitcoins go in, 500 totally unrelated addresses pay out, with no direct tx in between. Therefore the tumbler has to carefully figure out his tumbling rule. Bonus points if he has a large pool of addresses/bitcoins which are unrelated, the outputs coming from those.
Of course if Bob reuses his (paperwallet-)address every time, and sends 100 to the tumbler first, then 99, then 98 and so on, and sherlock does find a few receipts, it's a strong lead.
So obviously he should use a new change address every time. In this particular case those (weirdly named) "stealth addresses" would help him, he only needs one paper printout and has infinite receiving addresses available.
Statistical analysis is a bitch. If it's always a big amount (between 90 and 100) he pays from and he immediately sends his complete (?!?) funds to the tumbler and pays from it in the same or a close block, someone can figure it out after knowing a few payment amounts.
This reminds me of the problem with encrypted traffic. If someone can watch both you and the server (or many routers), he can still see the pattern of traffic and figure out the path. Even through TOR, potentially.
To put all this into perspective: it will always be easier to get a search warrant and/or bug your stuff. If they would go as far as doing statistical blockchain analysis, they would be faster and cheaper and with stronger evidence to use traditional investigation methods. At least now. Some day they will have fully automatic statistical analysis of the blockchain. We better be ready for this by then.

I agree on all of this, technically. Same here for most of this.
Still, celebrating this seems strange to me. I see it as a problem, that almost noone is ready to store real money on their computers. Hooray for hardware wallets.
All right, maybe another bad analogy: "deadly diseases incentive medical progress -&gt; medical progress is good -&gt; deadly diseases are good".

I am a fan of all that secret spy stuff.
Still, there are two problems:
one with "plausible deniability" in general:
- the attacker can't prove you have a hidden, plausible deniable account/wallet/partition. As soon as your setup has that ability, it makes sense for the attacker to torture you until you revealed a second account, or died. (Well, probably not at border controls, yet)
edit: Game-theory article about this problem: 
the second with this "25th word" setup in particular:
- a 24 word seed is very hard to crack. An additional 25th word added to a compromised 24 word seed is trivial to crack: simply try all some-thousand combinations of those 24 words with another one. They can do that offline as well, if they write down or film the 24 words, as it's BIP39. Hey, they can even steal your main stash and say "we never learned about some other stash, go away".
It all depends on the scenario of course. But if you consider a scenari where you would (easily) give up the "fake" 24 words, change more than just one word for the main stash. Best, use a new 24 (or 25) word set.
Also, one should generally avoid situations with 5-dollar-wrenches and stuff, I guess.

On first thought I too was "so the customer pays the supplier, big deal..". But, wait, this is cool! It's fully automated and transparent, so the merchant may let the first three dozen customers pay on his suppliers' addresses, until his credit line window is reasonably paid for that month. Or decide to let customers pay directly at that one grumpy supplier. Or only keep the small, or the large payments for himself.
Or change the routing of all of this every other day again. 
Throw in hotwallets, coldwallets, multisig, paymentprocessors and automatic conversion into the mix for good measure.
Think "electricity grid" for money! Consume electricity from the grid, or power up those photovoltaic panels, or react on the electricity prices, all fully automated.

This video assumes an "anarchic" outcome in the cliché media sense, where everybody fights everyone else for surviving. In that scenario it really doesn't matter what you possess for trading, as people will try to kill you anyway.
First, it doesn't have to come out like this. I hope mankind isn't just *that* bad, and hope that there'll be some low-level kind of civilization left. Including barter. Like in/after wwII, where cigarettes became the local leading currency.
Second, we now have the technology for tiny (power-)independent isles. From Photovoltaic farms to handheld solar chargers for your smartphone. I have no idea how far one may get with this, but it's at least a tiny headstart from a 1970s total blackout.

Then it's just the question of how many bits you display, and how many bits have to look the same when I create my fake vanity address. If you display a big portion of the address, it might still be worth to create a matching fake address for high-profile addresses.
For me, not being able to visually verify what exactly I am signing on the wallet's display is a no-go. No matter how "clever" (ledger) or "confident" (coolwallet) the project.

Highly misleading title:
ECDSA is not compromised. The article/paper states that an infected offline wallet aka coldwallet aka airgapped bitcoin transaction signing device could manage to leak data across the airgap. Emphasis on "**infected offline wallet**".
As even "airgapped" bitcoin devices have to communicate, at least to get the signed tx out to a relaying device, it's obvious that more data may be hidden, if the "airgapped" device is infected.
Now if someone is able to hack the ECDSA principle, this would cause some waves. And I'm not talking about cryptocurrencies here.

If some alternate implementation has much less than the majority, and still builds onto the same blockchain as Bitcoin with its highest block at a time, it's not even a fork. It's an orphan machine and a waste of ressources. If that implementation only uses the Bitcoin blockchain as a one-time seed, well, why not.
Either way, at a 5% vs 95% distribution, it's all simple and clear.
It gets more interesting at the shades of gray in between, say, between 30% and 70%. Then one of them has the nominally larger backing, but those two implementations will still possibly mess each other up.
At this point, I don't care much about what implementation has what name, devs and backing any more. I'm really tired of this trainwreck we are in.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:21:30

Okay, enough baseless interpretation, now back to baseless speculation with the topic of the talk! heh
There were accusations of "paid trolls" in this sub for quite a while. This talk does sound plausible, and I guess "paid trolls" do exist. But for bitcoin? Wouldn't it be too late for such low-profile tactics? It surely wouldn't remove the cryptocurrency-"problem" completely and for good. If the NSA, and moreso the CIA, wouldn't prefer cryptocurrencies to be successful anyway. If such players want cryptocurrencies dead, they'll [need to] bring the big ban-hammer and stir [more] shit with the media.

Yes, code is more precise. But my impression is that the consensus rules are simple, few and distinct. Like, would fit onto a napkin and understandable by kids.
Anything above that "original intention" which might show up in code would be bugs then, not?
If I am not wrong here (no coder), I really would prefer a definition of the rules in plain human language. And a dozen implementations of it, so those bugs don't take down too much at once.
That there still isn't a definition in human language nor full documentation probably shows that am wrong in my assumption?

You have several copies and wallets for storing those coins, good.
Just to clarify though: you shouldn't spread your risk by "I made 10 wallets with 80 coins each" but instead "I made 10 wallets where I need any 6 of to access those 800 coins".
You can, for example, use the Armory fragmented backup option. Or do it by hand with ssss, "shamirs secret sharing scheme". Better, do both.
You can then freely decide how many puzzle pieces you create, and how many are needed. Depending on where and how to store them.
But some on paper, spread them among family and friends, stamp some into sheet metal and bury it. I'm sure he has a bank lockbox too ;-)
Bonus: that stash will be difficult to access, Scooby-Doo-Scavengehunt style. Makes it easier to actually wait those five years :-)

Congrats on your find, Godfreee! :-)
FYI, as you partially blackened your adresses, it's not enough that way. with the first few letters you already can find the adress on a blockexplorer. Four to six letters will be enough, that's what "firstbits" (maybe in combination with vanity adresses) did before. If there's more than one exact hit, you would use the first hit on "firstbits" (duh!) and do some date correlation or trying to link several adresses if known.
I write this publicly, as others know this already, and everyone should be aware of these implications.

Sorry to answer to the (here, off-topic) blocksize bit instead of the meta-conspiracy-topic:
If the blocks fill up, the fees will rise. But still, some transactions will not make it into the blocks. Yes, it will probably be the least-fee-transactions. But even if every transaction had one bitcoin as fee, not all transactions would fit in the blocks. Consequently, some users will fail to get their transaction into the blockchain at all, and will turn around and look for other means to transfer money. Like, paypal.
So, back to the "Bitcoin as an inter-banking-settlement-network" or "I pay my coffee via Bitcoin" question.
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:46:35
Basically it states that the NSA is using social tactics to keep the world from using strong crypto.
- Like, pretending to be a VC, visiting startups to spy on them, then tipping off other companys which may have patents to destroy the startup.
- Using moles in open source dev teams to influence projects directly, via "oops, this patch had errors, sorry for that", bad/misleading/missing documentation, overcomplicating stuff, creating obscure or unexpected default options.
- Using trolls to directly annoy or harass devs
- Using trolls to move the attention of devs and communities to relatively unimportant details, and/or fuelling controvercies
The goal is to prevent "dangerous" tech to even be created in a useful way. For a tiny fraction of the costs it would take with conventional methods, if it would have been possible at all. Completely under the radar too.
Examples given were SSL (stuffed with way way too much, horrible docu, unexpected default behaviors) and e-mail-encryption (different incompatible standards).

One consensus rule set. As many implementations as possible. I'd like to see as many implementations as mining pools, with none over 15%, and definitely under 51%. Of course it would split the limited development power into more projects, so a good value has to be found somewhere.

A good way could be multisig. Like, every wallet on every device you use is a 1-of-2 multisig wallet. The second key is always the same, on every wallet. You are forced to enter that at wallet creation, and hopefully have it stored in a vault. Every few years you look through the left inputs on that backup key, and sweep them.
I am positive this would be possible without keeping additional master secrets on all devices, and the public key needed to enter on all devices could be something memorable.
The problem with "after a year, my wallet automatically forwards remaining funds" is of course that I might have drowned my phone in a lake, so the wallet itself can't do much any more.
Some "send this input in 12 months" transaction with ntimelock would be possible, but this would still have to be broadcasted by the (drowned) wallet in 12 months.
So, still, the best I can come up with is a master backup key as a 1-of-2-multisig scheme that is used for every single wallet you use.
@_date: 2016-06-11 18:15:42
One would "prove" with reputation. Having made many such transactions before, or linking real-world identity data and/or other valuable accounts (facebook, ebay, linkedin etc).
Not sure if this is a viable option for you considering the sum.
Or you could convince someone with details about what you plan to do.

Of course it's the other way round: "All the banks that launder money hate bitcoin" (maybe scrap the 'that' here anyway).

@_date: 2018-10-11 07:41:34
At the very least you need the channel capacity for the volume you want to send, and funds in lightning channels are probably much more "online" than liquid-bitcoins need to be. As we are talking about potentially huge transactions between exchanges, a sidechain seems worth it to me.
Let's see if this will be used by people too, or if it will in effect be similar to a "closed, fast inter-banking network" (closed as in just used by them).
Edit: I now understand it's a way for users to transfer bitcoins faster between their accounts on different exchanges. Not an "open" system like a general cryptocurrency, and not a system for exchanges to bundle transactions more efficient between each other.

I learned one or another bloody lessons myself, no laughter from me here.
One question I ask myself when I come to own some questionable thing (and yes, everything deserves to be questioned, bitcoin too):
**"would I buy this right now if I didn't own it and had fiat/bitcoin?"**
For example, I split my bcash the other day. What to do with them? Sell all? Sell half? **"Would I buy bcash now?"** No. So I sold them all.
I too owned toxic things of too high value. Not altcoins, but margin positions in the deep red. Now I try to ask myself the above, and try to always set a stop loss. And stick to it later on too. Oh, and generally I avoid trading now :-)

I didn't even read the article. As an entire OS, it's a collection of thousands of components with milions of lines of code, an endless field to hide backdoors or manipulate the way pseudorandomness is generated. Just like every other OS as well of course.
Being solely targeted at cryptocurrency uses, it's among the biggest honeypots there is, to backdoor by the developers, hackers, or ISP- and state-level actors. I couldn't ever trust any product like that, sorry. Not even from Marek, Peter or Joanna themselves.
The \*only\* reason I trust any soft- or hardware that is targeted at Bitcoin is precisely that I can put an off-the-shelf (= non-bitcoin related) OS in between the bitcoin-related product and the internet.

Let's assume for a moment there are backdoor functions in intels ME and the NSA had access to it. (I don't find that too far-fetched)
The development, planting and keeping it secret was expensive. Moreso, if intel itself isn't aware of it. It would surely be a three-digit million USD sum, all in all. It took time to reach this point, now, where close to every single halfway modern computer is bugged.
If this would go public, the damage would be immense:
* the NSA loses their by far largest tool to spy on computers.
* the NSA would receive bad backlash from this
* the distrust against hardware from the states and the states itself would rise immensely
* Intel would fall into a hole deeper than where VW went. This would be a potentially lethal blow.
Every single use of that backdoor would pose a risk to be discovered. As was stated, it's easy to watch all network traffic from a router or other network hardware.
This backdoor would be so valuable, yet so dangerous, it would only be used in the most important scenarios thinkable. And only if other techniques failed. And only when they are 100% sure they will easily bag the hardware afterwards, with no danger of being caught in the act.
Which scenario might warrant its use then? They would first use their machinery of other, known attack vectors. Only very few targets would "survive" this. What's left to attack via this backdoor might be on a level with wikileaks, roque nuclear weapons facilities, silkroad. And even those three were seemingly brought down with more conventional tools (or were they?). It might very well be that this backdoor hasn't been used in the wild once. Because, you know, they are afraid to break it.
(And I didn't even begin with possible exfiltration techniques, to be more stealth.)
**tl;dr:** noone here has to be afraid to be spied on via a possible Intel ME backdoor.
It's certainly impossible to just catch this backdoor with a simple packetsniffer on a random Intel machine.

There's two entirely different scenarios when investing money:
- "I made some sweet profit, which I now cash in, this makes my life better"
- "I risk sum X, and wait until it gained life-changing profits, or lost it's value entirely"
Both are valid strategies. But they fit best to different kinds of assets: hoping for small, but safe profits makes sense with conservative assets, think "IBM stocks". Hoping for outrageous profits with insane risks to lose it all better fits with some unknown crazy company stock, that noone ever heard of.
Obviously Bitcoin is a high risk, high volatility asset. If people suggest to cash out at "only" 50% or 100% profit, they have no clue what they are talking about.

A few questions that might interest others as well:
* What paper do I need? Regular paper fluorescences like crazy, do I still see my UV ink printing?
* How visible is the UV ink under normal lighting?
* How stable is the print? How long will it last in darkness? In light? Sunlight?
* What are the properties of the bare ink? Is it as liquid as fountain pen ink, for example? Can I fill a spare fountain pen with this?
Do you plan to offer other UV items? Like UV flashlights or light fixtures?

5% fees, 3c, would be a 60c transaction. Sounds reasonable for a kid to bring out the trash, not?
Also, with rising exchangerate the x satoshi fee will be more fiat. This makes larger and larger microtransactions economically uninteresting.
Replace-by-fee would raise the fees, making this more uninteresting for 60c per garbagedelivery.
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:41:27
Be your own fee calculator:
Hover the mouse at how many tx and fees are in queue right now, and how deep down they got confirmed at the last block(s). With this, you can precisely place your fees where it will be one of the cheapest tx in the next block.
If the next block takes much longer and the included fees go higher, you can still bump your fees if you set RBF, replace-by-fee.

If there are many different implementations used as clientsoftware (relay) and mining nodes, the network is more resilient. If one implementation is buggy, it will "just" be thrown out of the chain and will end on its own, short sidechain.
As it is now, with basically one implementation being the mining software everywhere, we end up with dangerous network splits, forks, which need to be adressed immediately and coordinated.
Exactly this happened in 2013, when a buggy upgrade caused a split:
Miraculously, it was fixed within six hours by the devs and all major mining pool operators.

"Old coins" is easy, either by observing the general "bitcoin days destroyed" (counting how many [bitcoins * their age] are moved) or by directly looking into the transaction, and looking up how old the inputs were.
"Gox coins" is much more difficult. Someone has to explain me how it is known those coins in question are/were connected/owned by Gox. Maybe they come directly from old big Gox adresses? Those were all empty, it seems. Or the leak back then contained deposit adresses? Not that I remember.

Conveniently, the next, fourth halving, was not drawn into this chart. With regularly every four years, it is scheduled for 2024. Very close to the next peak at August 2023. So, even if this "reapeating pattern" stays, it can't be repeating in any way after the next peak. Simply because the pattern asks for longer and longer periods per cycle, but the halvings are set every four years.
Next, in a logarithmic chart like this even a seemingly tiny distance between the line, arrow etc and the actual graph can mean huge differences in absolute numbers or percent. Too bad the scale/grid makes it look like something linear. Do you have a newer version of this? Or higher resolution?
Also, first I was amazed by the neat linear graphs of "cycle number" vs "downturn days" and "cycle days". But of course, those include the guess for the next downturn and cycle. With downturn, we have two points and one guessed point strategically placed so it forms a line with the two real points. With "cycle" and three real data points, it's only a bit better.
Finally, the real data since this graph was drawn doesn't fit that well any more, we are higher again than it guessed. At 3600 USD we are at the schedule of end of 2020 already. Again, it might look like a tiny distance on this logarithmic chart. and of course, in hindsight, any (false) peaks and drops are easy to disregard as outliers too.
In conclusion, I don't trust any TA prediction. But am between amused and amazed how well some seem to fit nonetheless. 2023 is too far away for my taste anyway.
I'd love to have a scientist working in statistics, or mathematician or the like have a look at this, these graphs. How much can one fit into a true random graph? How much of this is unexpected in a random graph?

A small reminder: every program or script which targets Bitcoin enthusiasts should be executed very carefully. Imagine to have control over a program that runs on several thousand Bitcoin enthusiasts computers. How many of those own Bitcoins? Scan the computer for a wallet, keylog until you have the password, profit.
I'm not saying this script here is malicious, not at all.
I personally would have to read the script and understand it by myself, before executing it. A Bitcoin-centered linux distribution? It's so complex, I couldn't ever trust it and would have to compile it by myself instead.
If you run any Bitcoin software, only use software you trust the developers. Verify the checksum. Verify the PGP-keys.
Better yet: run software in VMs. Better better yet: run your wallet and other critical programs in its own, secured VM. Qubes OS is a linux distribution which is based on that principle. It makes it very easy and secure, after setting it up once.

- Why do you think Bitcoin will shine in this "business"? Because it is somewhat anonymous? Well, guess what, users need to publish their data to find others, and eventually those two will need to exchange real-world meetup data and will -gosh- meet face to face (and all). Sure, go ahead and make all that anonymous anc encrypted and PGP and Tor and all that. Blackmarket/Silkroad/OpenBazaar style. There won't be 37M members, but more like 370 members.
- Why that "oh my god it has to happen NAO!!1!" shouting? Do you plan to invite those 37M to-be-leaked users? Well, if they are not leaked, you won't get the data. Wait, maybe 100 BTC will get you the leak. If they are leaked, well, bad for them. Either way, it's ridiculous to believe any substantial number of those 37M will engage (heh) on your site.
- You seem to be very enthusiastic about that project. I am not too impressed. Not becvause of technical reasons, but because of social reasons. Think facebook vs diaspora. Think google vs duckduckgo. Think email vs PGP. I believe the world is not ripe for such a project on a scale you are hoping for.

I like the idea. It still is somewhat related to regular faucets, as ads generate the bits that are given to visitors/contributors. But visitors come for the porn, mostly. Neat!
Although, better brace yourself for a flood of non licensed material from professional copyright holders. Aka stolen porn, which will eventually attract the people owning it. Youtube seems to handle that situation with a combination of "complain here" and "sorry, this video is banned for upload, someone complained before". A different option might be a fat disclaimer, or moving all of this to a hoster where it isn't an issue.
Of course the uploading users won't care, as Bitcoin is "anonymous", and Tor is anonymous :-)
Also, make that "Live BTC Cam girls" link open in a new tab to not lose all of the users clicking it.

But that's exactly why Room77 accepted zeroconf since 2011 and there never was a doublespend. Precisely because guests have a good time there, often are Bitcoin enthusiasts, are in meatspace with meatspace cooks and waiters, the amounts are single- or double digits, and guests will prefer to be allowed to come back there.

For normal people paying retail prices for mining hardware I find it not worth the risks. You'll have ROI between 6 months and a year, at current difficulty and exchangerate. Both will change drastically within one year. If you end up on the green or red side depends on how the diff and exchangerate develop.
All that doesn't even account for electricity, like in your case.
I have no clue how mining is possible right now. Either the mining companies get _huge_ discounts on hardware, or only the hardware producers have a sane business concept, or everyone is going nuts and all-in.
I, personally, don't see much sense in mining in comparison to buying bitcoins directly. Obviously I am missing some secret details in the mining industry here.
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:51:20
I disagree. Big operations have the advantage of cheaper hardware (economy of scale or even selfmade asics) and more flexibility where to deploy for cheaper electricity.
It was better with CPU and GPU mining, as the hardware costs were comparably low and some homeminers had "free" electricity.
The only solution I see for the whole mining situation is to change the POW to something very RAM demanding, away from computational power demanding.

Absolutely not. Please compare volume on all exchanges combined to mining reward. It's a drop in the ocean.

\- "To check on my balance with importing a watch-only copy of my paperwallet"
\- "When I need funds, I only import one address of my stash to minimize risk"
\- "Oh, weird bug, now all my 100 addresses are shown as empty, huh.."

You probably have to install Armory (without syncing and without core would be ok) and import the key as a wallet recovery seed. I don't think it's a privatekey. A seed would be several lines, a private key would start with a "5" and be one line.

Bitfinex gave out IOU tokens for the 36% loss all users faced. Those can be traded on their platform. Bitfinex plans to rebuy them all at face value of 1USD, the value they were given when the tokens were handed out.
There are plans to put BFX on a blockchain, so users can withdraw them and trade on other exchanges too. Until then, I consider them tokens, and not crypto.
An exchange rate of 0.50USD means one could reduce the loss from 36% to 18%. Not bad.

A small note on bitcoin transactions, screenshots and "anonymity", or pseudonymity: you seem to try to hide your bitcoin addresses, with blacking out all but the first few letters. Still, you leak too much info in that screenshot. The first three letters (excluding the leading '1') will most often be enough to pinpoint any address in the blockchain. You show even more than that. Then, with showing many used addresses, even the first letter (after '1') would be enough to identify them, by looking for related address groups matching the letters. You indirectly give hints to narrow down the time they were used too. Now, you also show significant data with up to 8 digits on the amount of bitcoins in single addresses. With that, it's one simple query in the blockchain to find several of your addresses. Finally, showing the full summed up balance, one could probably find a set of addresses loaded within a month which add up to that exact sum.
I don't think it matters too much here, or in most posts where someone leaks too much info. I try to warn, so they don't rely on failed anonymity for whatever reason they tried to achieve it.
StopAndDecrypt suggested to burn your reddit account and never reuse, I second this. Be cautionous on replies or private messages. All is well, as you used a new account. I don't think people would find you on a hypothetical other reddit account just by fingerprinting your writing style.

Well, TA, technical analysis, drawing-lines-on-charts, just do that. They either ignore fundamentals (external factors you mention) completely as irrelevant in the long run, or assume they are priced in or something. Or simply write in the fineprints "this TA might happen with no disturbtion from stupid fundamentals".
But yeah, I see their point. We got lots of fundamentals interfering (forks, wars, cyprus, china), and still the chart looks as it is. I more and more believe those fundamentals are triggers only, but not reasons for price actions, in the long run.

The attack was probably from your computer. Either local, physical access, or remote access software. A virus scanner does only protect against automated widespread malware against as many targets as possible. If someone specifically attacked you, it's trivial to edit the malware to be 'unique' to not be detected by antivirus software.
Consider your computer, all passwords you used on that computer, your e-mail-accounts used on that computer, and potentially all devices connected to it  (external drives, backuptargets, smartphone, servers, NAS) compromised too.
- literally pull the power cord on it, not shutting it down regularly.
- make a 1:1 image of the harddisk(s) with a linux live system and dd. Be careful not to accidently overwrite the wrong disk.
- nuke the harddisk, preferably with linux and dd as well, while you are at it
- reinstall your windows from scratch. Consider linux, it's the way to go for everything besides some professional software (photoshop etc) and heavy gaming
- as soon as possible, reset all (important) passwords, from a known clean system. E-Mails, bitcoin, paypal, banking etc. Create fresh wallets, send bitcoins over
- without executing infectious files from your image or backups (drivers, programs etc), setup your system
- find out how and when you got infected (good luck, tough one!)
- find out what data is infected, and what is safe. Old, not connected backups are safe, virus-scanner checked data might or might not be safe
This is probably most of a full 'how to recover from a hack' checklist. It will take days to weeks, but is the only way to afterwards be somewhat sure to be clean again. No use to lose more stuff in a few months for having stayed infected all along. Consider it a fun exercise, learning opportunity, challenge and course in paranoia.
Long-term, and this is meant for everyone: think about secure separation of "domains", like separating gaming and freeware from business from bitcoin. Think about automated backups, which can't be infected from a hacked host. Think about using a system that is much tougher than average to infect in the beginning.
Good luck. People on reddit will be glad to assist when needed.

In case OP is of okex, or someone is reading here: Localbitcoin pulled out of Germany several years ago, there's still no replacement established.Only two platforms with a fraction of even the users on Localbitcoin  years ago. It would make sense to start to focus on Germany as a market, and conquer other, surrounding countries as the next step. Even ATMs were nonexistant until a few months ago, now there's a handfull only.
Also, be as transparent as possible, especially with how this zero-fee business is legit and still profitable.
edit: Ah, I made the mistake to first reply, and check the webpage afterwards. So okex is an exchange, with hundreds of ~~shit~~*alt*coins, derivates and tools or whatever, and now additionally the OTC option. I don't think this will get relevant marketshare in Germany, and probably only in local niches anyway. So, good luck, I guess.

Heck no! "Publishing" the 24 word seed and relying on a strong 25th passphrase is exactly the wrong way to do it! [XKCD is always relevant]( It has so so so much less entropy that your funds are not secure at all, if an attacker gets to learn your 24 words. Ask "Dave" or the "large Bitcoin collider" to get an idea how scaringly far those operations are.
Also, you will eventually lose any password, passphrase, seed that you only remember in your head. It's only a question if it takes weeks for complex passphrases, years for good memory, bad luck for any kind of brain injury, or death, which will come inevitably.
There are solutions for storing passphrases in a safe and secure way. "SSSS", "last will", "notary", "bank vault", "several trusted friends and family", "glacier protocol", "casa hodl", there's many options for every amount of funds and level of effort and paranoia.

This sentence is complicated. I first understood it as "more and more old coins are moving now", which would be the opposite of hodling.
On second try it probably means "of all coins moved, the percentage of old coins is on the rise". Not sure if that is pro or against hodling.
The number I would like to know, is if the percentage of one-year old coins on the move is rising or falling. If it is falling, like, less old coins move and more of the old coins stay where they are, that would mean "more hodling" to me.
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:47:09
Good food for thought.
I, for example, would not rely on any bitcoin-related software to verify such claims, but try to verify the signing on off-the-shelf tools like openssl (as well). Just to rule out  long-con where I ended up with a tampered bitcoind for example.

Oh, and throw "exchange" in the mix, none here. Only one marketplace. Same reason, money transmitter license.
It's all coming from how bafin, the highest financial bureau, defined crypto and how to comply to the regulation.
Only good news, here, is that we have the first company(s) working on getting that license finally. And that bitcoin profits are tax fee after one year hodling.

It's ludicrous to check Bitcoins "market cap" or, even more so, that of any altcoin, and expect it to have any real-world meaning.
Or, the other way round: we were at ~20k already. That's 1/50 or 1Mil. Well, does it seem plausible that 1% of all "narrow money" (thanks for that name, didn't know it before) was invested in Bitcoin at that moment?

They had good security in the past (cold-wallet with manual topup of the hotwallet). For legal reasons they switched to BitGo, who turned out to be a very bad choice. "Lied"? They publicly announced this, like, everywhere. Yes, they got hacked, and lost a lot of funds. But how they dealt with it so far was great indeed. Ask any customer of any other hacked exchange for a reality check.
They did well in tough times and are back to a security model I trust enough. Yes, they earned points with me. I find it plausible that they'll make all customers whole, which will turn them to rockstars in the exchange environment.
Cut them some slack where it's due.

This one is easy to spot and will be "secure" if you use it on an offline computer, as it's often suggested.

All of armory (I forgot offline wallet in the first post) is just copying strings of letters or files, the GUI is doing a good job to tell you what to do where and keeping your funds safe from mistakes.
It's too much hassle for most people in most situations, and makes more sense with larger sums, high security needs (longterm, or no single point of failure/trust etc) or complicated constellations (boardmembers with shared access to funds for example).
For regular private people, yes, use armory for long-term storage and/or keeping funds safe from loss, betrayal and extortion. Besides the advanced everyday privacy-enhancing features which make sense for every transaction.

Damn, very exciting! But I fear it will not receive the public attention it deserves.
Think about it - after choosing a reasonably secure OS, removing all unneeded software and daemons, putting your computer behind a dedicated firewall, and physically locking down your hardware - you still have encrypted, uncheckable binary blobs running directly within your CPU, but actually with higher rights than your cpu. Direct access to memory and network interfaces. Unreachable by your regular CPU. And with "remote administration" as one of the "features" they officially advertise with!
Want another, clean CPU? Tough luck, scratch intel and AMD then. ARM, if you prefer a computer as powerful as your smartphone. IBM, if you want the most exotic and expensive hardware possible.

That was, guesstimate, up to 2014? I guess today a lot more botnets would deploy bitcoin miners, as bitcoin is more mainstream now, and the botnet business got more professional too. Do you think we would not get into a downward spiral where the difficulty rises until mining with one computer yields just slightly more than sending spam with it (not that those two would necessarily be mutually exclusive)? How would 50M bots mining a CPU-mining-bitcoin possibly not result in making it economically impossible for regular people to mine with their home computer?

I have a different approach: if Bitcoin (yes, "legacy") stays the dominant chain, a 1:1 atomic swap doubles my bitcoins. If 2x becomes the dominant chain, this proves to a lot of people that bitcoin as a whole is a failed experiment, as it has been forced to change by a small group of businessmen and is in a more centralized state.
I hear a similar conclusion from core devs, for example.
I will try to setup a 1:1 atomic swap before the fork date. I either double, or lose it all. If I don't do anything, I either keep the same, or lose it all.

Of course those satoshis have a market value. However, the ~~protocol~~ rules have some fixed fee rules, afaik a minimum fee at the very least.
Secondly, the gradual shift in mining from blockreward to fees could be seen strictly in bitcoin-denomination too.
So for now, I see stable or rising fees, until lightning or some other higher-level mechanism reduces the load on the bare blockchain.

Core developers will not agree to any solution that has less than a one, two year roadmap. Even if it's a fabulous, brilliant solution from satoshi herself. That roadmap nees to include open discussions, drafts, reviews, testnet implementations, tests with wallets, and all of that in several rounds until it is trustworthy.

"Replay" means to take a transaction on the 2x chain, and broadcasting it on the bitcoin chain. Or vice versa. Without replay protection, the transactions are valid on both chains/networks and would be transacted on both. So if I send my 2x coins to someone, she (or anyone, really) can replay that transaction to the bitcoin chain/network, and my corresponding bitcoins are sent to her as well.
You can get around that, but it costs money and time, and generally only possible for technically advanced people (having two wallets with BTC and B2X, sharing the same wallet, sending each unspent coin one by one to different addresses on the two chains simultaneously, until they are effectively split ).
In short: people will lose money.

Too late, but anyway:
I don't think we need more user adoption at this point. We don't need more vendor adoption neither. Why? Both sides pay a premium (fees, time, effort, training, security). Neither side has any advantage, when we are talking about regular brick stores where one would instead pay in cash.
What we need, instead, are markets and opportunities where Bitcoin solves a real problem, gives real advantages. Like micropayments, international transfers, grey and dark markets etc. Both sides have advantages in using Bitcoin. Both sides would probably even be willing to pay a premium, so strong are the advantages.
So find more killer applications for Bitcoin instead. We don't need more bakeries and more people buying bread to use Bitcoin. And for that, I believe we could spend that money better elsewhere.
tl;dr: don't spend money on advertising markets where Bitcoin doesn't play out its advantages.

Misleading title. This just calculates how much x amount of electricity cost in different coun tries.
Still, this is only one of many important factors.
- How much will cooling cost? Easily double the electricity costs for that, if it's a hot region, or zero if it's iceland for example.
- How much will administration cost? How much are the wages in that country?
- Will you go to jail for mining? Oops, there goes Venezuela.
- Last, but most important, how much will you spend for the actual hardware? Probably half of the "retail" price if you are a neighbor of the producer, i.e. China.
- Oh, are there secret, grey-area deals directly with the powerplant? Then ignore the list completely, and start to print money.

For more advanced usage I recommend armory. fragmented backups, multisig, several wallets in one gui, complete control over inputs, change addresses and fees and so on. It comes at some price with keeping the full blockchain and getting comfortable with all the options, so I would only recommend it for serious business ;-)

*..what I wrote 5 days ago, with close to no feedback:*
For quite some time the idea pops up to change the POW, proof-of-work algorithm of bitcoin. It is SHA256 now, that's what the ASIC mining hardware calculates, and that's all they can do.
Many people are unhappy with the centralization of mining: only very few manufacturers, all of them in china, a few mining pools/companies hold the majority of mining power, and almost all of it in china, again. I am unhappy about that too:
It is, at this point, a mining cartel which actively works against decentrality, for example with
- big pools attract more new mining power (less orphans, less variation in payout, better economy-of-scale)
- the orphan rate is lower when closer to (physically, network-lag-times wise) the majority of mining power, in china. The chinese firewall with limited bandwith enhances this, compared to other parts of the word
- the big pools/companies built a dedicated, fast mining-network in between them, enhancing the point above further
- mining hardware on the open (enduser) market is so expensive, it doesn't even make much sense to mine even with free electricity (ROI anywhere between 6 and 12 months, difficulty- and price fluctuations make any sensible calculation impossible)
All of this is bad indeed.
So let's change the POW, use something else than SHA256, and make all of that mining hardware expensive doorstops, right? Maybe even with a rotating POW, changing every 100 blocks (read that today, hence this post).
- First, current miners wouldn't just throw out their hardware and call it a day. They would use the hardware somewhere else, as long ass it gains more than electricity costs. This would at least result in a fork. Or, opposite, it's a scenario to get rid of all miners for good if the november s2x fork happens and we use the "nuclear option".
- Still, don't make the mistake to assume *any* algo, *any* POW could be ASIC-proof on a technical level: any algorithm that can be worked on with a CPU can be poured in an ASIC too. We might need quite different ASIC designs than we are used to now, if the POW is based on high memory for example. The more general the POW is (rotating aspects), the closer we get to a "general purpose calculating machine" aka CPU. but still, a dedicated ASIC will probably always be doable and more efficient than a CPU. We only don't have ASSICs for all the altcoins because it's expensive to develop.
- Lastly, here's for me the killer against changing POW: CPUs are horribly centralized. We have admins which control many servers, for example. And, we have botnets. The largest, Bredonet, seems to be 30 million computers big. The botnet operator is, by definition, criminal, malicious, anonymous and doesn't have real costs "owning" those computers (air conditioning, electricity, operation, hardwarefailures etc). They could mine bitcoins at any difficulty and any price, and would still make some money. The only reason they don't do it any more with the current POW and ASICs as competition is because the real/former computer owner is more likely to detect the infection when the computer is mining, and the return now really approaches zero because of ASICs. They are mining ether and monero though.
As much as I am sceptical about big mining operations, I would be more sceptical of five botnets having 80% of the hashpower at basically no costs. hich might quickly turn to 99%, as noone can compete with them who has to pay for elecricity and hardware themselves.
So, is everything lost in "mining and decentralization"? Right now, yes. My hope is, though, in the long run: soon, mining ASIC chips use the most recent technology available, comparable to CPUs made by Intel and AMD. from there on, ASIC evolution will only be as fast ass CPU evolution, for example doubling in speed (or hashes-per-power) every 18 months. Hardware will be economically functional longer (for example 18 months). There will, i hope, be more competition. with more companies developing ASICs, as everything slowed down and bitcoins market and economy grew too. We will have competition, with lower prices, and realistic prices for endusers too. We will have mining hardware integrated everywhere, where electricity is used to heat things. My examples are heating a pool and floor/wall integrated heating, both have a target temperature where ASICs survive (no mining water kettle, or toaster, sorry). 21.co had something along those lines as their (former?) goal.
At that point, ASICs and mining will be so widespread and commonplace that it can't be misused for power grabs (* we'll still have pools then, and need to figure that one out though).
When this will happen, if at all, noone can say. I don't think it will happen within the next two years. But once it starts, it will be a huge stampede.
**tl;dr:** don't change the POW to exclude current ASIC miners. It would all happen again eventually with new ASICs. Or only botnet operators continue to mine anyway. Instead, we'll include cheap, long-lasting ASICs in many household heating things like pool heaters, soon enough.

My recommendation would be ddrescue, it doesn't stop when read errors happen, but continues and leaves the unreadable sectors with zeroes. It gives a list of non-readable data at the end. It can take a long time on damaged drives, but no way to get around that once it's damaged anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:22:18
Well said.
To clarify, it's not one, two big miners who switch *all* hashing power at once, but many small miners (too), so the hashrate will follow the relativ exchangerate more or less exactly.
* BTC (old) 3000 USD: 5/6 of the combined price, 83% hashrate
* BTC (segwit2x) 600 USD: 1/6 of the combined price, 17% hashrate
(I expect the combined price to be lower than BTC now, at first)
Curious to see if the hashrate will diverge from that simple, purely economic calculation (for ideological reasons etc). Theoretically, with no "manipulation" and "attacks", that could become and stay pretty stable too. Except the missing replay protection, that is.
It'll be interesting where the relative exchangerate will be. Considering how political and ideological it got, and how much is at stake for a lot of big players (more than just money). People throwing around four-, five digit coins will be popcorn-worthy, to say the least.

True. But even if several people are convicted for crimes, they might morally be in entire different groups. Depending on if and who they harmed, motives and what/whose gains/profits it was. You can, for example, still be perfectly open, honest and have good intentions, and still go to jail. Or be deceisive, backstabbing and 'walk over corpses', as we say here.
Before I interact or follow or recommend someone, I'd do a quick check. If the first page of google is full of that stuff, I'd have to take a very close look to come to a conclusion.

But it's exactly the same with the other side of the future, BT1 exchange rate (or BTC - BT2 rate): bigblockers say "we have 95% hashrate, we won't use replay protection and old, BT1 Bitcoin will stop existing".
So we have, according to bigblockers, the possibility and plan to terminate BT1. Same risk on both futures, and everyone can come up with some probability of one or the other.
I can't find any unfair treating in BT2 at those futures at all.
Let me put it the other way round: would you agree to give me back the value I lost, if I bought BT1 and it stopped to exist in November? Something along these lines was how I understood Oliviers whiny post some days ago when BitFinex started those futures.

Thanks for clarifying. XKCDs 'correct horse battery staple' shows the calculations on how many bits a \*random\* passphrase has. 6 words sounds fine, if randomly chosen.
Your setup sounds good. Why PGP though? Sounds like making it more complicated, with no added safety, and creating unnecessarily big outputs. A symmetric algo, like AES (or an alternate one with no NSA involvment), would be simpler with smaller output (for smaller QRs, bigger dots, or higher redundancy). Ony drawback I see is those algos are fast, to calculate and to bruteforce.
Like, you need to store the PGP key too, which must be pretty huge as a QR?

Apparently that "opt-in replayprotection opcode" makes it a non-standard transaction, but still a valid one. Nodes won't forward it, but a miner can still put it in a block.
You'll have to wait for some blocks depth confimarmation to be sure, and for that you can do manual splitting and/or tainting as well.
Edit: only few wallets are even able to do opcodes (armory can).
Also, that thing is not through yet, still being discussed. Don't even ask about a testnet to actually try that feature, there's no testnet nor any definition, draft, exampleimplementation of that segwit2x fork.

What's stopping me from creating a 4mb tx, with high fee, to attack the network?
What's stopping a miner to creat a 4mb block for free (minus lost fees from mempool)?
If that would slow/crash all nodes, those fees would be a cheap price for such an attack.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:06:49
We already have a block increase. It is called segwit. With that, blocks can hold up to 4 MB.
Second, it doesn't even make sense to ask for "segwit +2mb". We don't have a blocksize any more. We have blockweight. And that is up to 4 MB per block. What exactly is "segwit +2mb" meaning?
Segwit and "double the maximum block weight" would make 8mb weighted blocks. This is provenly beyond the line of being dangerous to the network, in terms of centralization (bandwith hurdle), orphaning (sync time), and is possible to exploit with, for example, creating cheap and enormous transactions which slow down/halt/crash miners and nodes alike.
Finally, there is no need for an imminent capacity increase. The spam stopped, and immediately blocks and mempool are so "empty" that 20sat/b mining fees are sufficient.
Lightning was already tested in the wild *nods to room77*, we'll have a million times capacity increase soon enough.
This wouldn't be a compromise. It would be bowing down to nonsense "solutions" for problems we don't have, at prices we don't want and need to pay.
And I, personally, won't stop fighting against segwit2x. Because it's an attack, nothing less. Their goal is to either remove core devs (lol) or destroy bitcoin/segwit2x for pumping bcash or other altcoins. Or all those vocal madmen are straight out bought, this too would explain it.

First, people who want to prove control over a Bitcoin address need to sign the right message. It must contain the name, date and purpose of the signing. Like for example, "This address belongs to reddit.com, today is 10/30/17.". This both makes clear that you indeed own that address and didn't copy the signed message elsewhere, and prevents others to do the same with your message.
In this case, renben9 asked you to sign that message. Good enough here, but still not the recommended way.
So, what happened. I never used blockchain.info, but I'm quite sure one can figure out if coins got stolen with logging in there or not. You had 2-factor-authentication active, I suppose from your text. Even with hacked e-mail and 2-FA, which isn't impossible, you would be able to see activities in your blockchain.info account.
So the thief must have done it a different way. Maybe bitaddress.org is stealing, or got hacked, or your private key was siphoned off when sending it to you (via unencrypted http instead of https connection). I find all of those quite unlikely.
My guess is that your computer, that you used to create the private key, was or is infected. As others said, it's simple to watch the clipboard (or any written textfile) for strings with 256bit starting with a "5" or the like. Then sending it home, and automatically checking if it belongs to an existing bitcoin address. This is only little code, quite non-intrusive, and used on a small target group (bitcoiners), so virus scanners normally wouldn't detect it, maybe for months, maybe forever.
Consider your computer, backups, mobile phone compromised. Pull the plug, create an image of every device (I recommend linux with dd), then wipe and reinstall. Don't use any program files from those devices, downloadd all executables fresh again.
From a known good system, preferrably linux again, mount your images and see if you find symptoms for infection.
That is, if you want to figure out what happened. I definitely would want to know, just to know the damage. What kind of malware? Did it compromise any, all of my other accounts? Did it spread to friends, or are my backups infected? Or was it some other kind of hack? Did someone break into my home and clone my computer? Or am I under video surveillance? Am I still? Or was it an insider job? Friends, family, neighbors?
Now to securely handle larger sums of bitcoin:
- Windows is not secure
- Linux is somewhat more secure
- any online system a user uses for surfing, mail, media etc should be considered compromised
- don't assume you can detect or even clean infections, virus scanners are a kind of scam in itself
- use an offline system, booted from a live system, without reading or writing to harddisks. Tails was suggested, +1. Any live linux disk of the bigger distros is fine (Ubuntu for example)
- create your keys. With a dedicated tool, wallet, or bitaddress.com website saved to USB (in order of preference)
- create many keys. 10, or several sheets with 10 each
- you can create qr codes while at it. Addresses are public, feel free to copy to your main computer/regular OS.
- print your paperwallets. On a dumb printer. If you suspect it might have internal memory, disconnect from power afterwards to clear memory. If it might have a harddisk, disassemble afterwards to find out.
- Send your coins to, for example, your 10 addresses. Make sure the address wasn't replaced at some point.
- do not import those anywhere.
- when you need to spend coins, you only import as little as you need. That way you don't have additional risk to lose more coins than you risk in counterparty risk to the recipient anyway.
Now, want to create backups? Encrypted backups? N-of-M backups etc? I suggest to read into armory, btcarmory.com. 
And for less hassle, offline-signing without rebooting all the time, armory again. With qubes OS, the only reasonably secure OS I know.
All of this doesn't directly help you with regaining your lost coins. But as soon as you know what exactly happened to you, you can try to find clues. In case of malware there are a lot of things to check for leads.

Which is fine, as they are miners and not traders/investors. And with electricity costs of mining they won't take much risk. I am sure they will jump to the more profitable chain (in difficulty/exchangerate) immediately and switching fast, and sell the mined coins immediately (for the other coin or cash or whatever) to minimize risk.
Which, again, is expected and fine.

That's not how the professional world works. Most companies will not have one of their employees read through all the info himself for weeks but hire someone who already knows all the stuff. Faster, less expensive, have a better chance that no important aspect is being left aside, and might even have someone to blame (financially) if the plan fails.
Just like not every company has its own admin, or cook, or janitor. Not even talking about SAP consultant or server deployer.

I see your point, but find it somewhat random nevertheless.
How about "I trade my 100 s2x coins for your 900 BTC", because, you know, s2x apparently has 90% minersupport?
Pretty random too.
Pricefinding in general is somewhat random to begin with.
So yes, I think a 1:1 swap is the compromise in the middle, and this implies a "we trade whatever of BTC is left existing with whatever will exist of s2x". Or will I get a full refund of my BTC if the BTC chain is technically dead, like, more than one day blocktime?

Debian has a SSSS implementation in its repos. I'm sure people can still find it in 20 years, in archives or still used in Debian then.
Also, give every person who receives a part also clear instructions what to do with it. Paper is fine, if you check on them still having their part regularly. Maybe even print out the SSSS source (SSSSS?) code. Or print a rough scheme (SSSSSS!) of how the algo works, from which a dev could reimplement it.
Finally, print out a "test case" with each part, where you have all 5 testcase parts printed and the secret it shall yield. That way people can test their setup, or the reimplementation, without risking any funds.

Because those fullnode-wallets would be 24/7 online with at least one service reachable from outside (bitcoin core), and have funds stored on them. Eventually someone would figure out how to identify nodes with funds. And then those would be attacked specifically. Or the user owning them, as now his/her ip is known and can be correlated to other attack vectors.
Also, those two devices (node and wallet) have incompatible goals (size, energyconsumption, mobility, UI etc).

Oh the pain! Well, they will learn the hard way how sophisticated crackers/phishers are now. If they can infect both your computer and your 2nd factor smartphone to steal your stuff right out of your banking software, this is a low-hanging piece of cake for them.
Could at least have a pin that is entered into the ATM, and never on the smartphone? Nah, let's have maximum convenience and buzz instead!
One good effect is that customers get used to the idea that a qr-code, essentially nothing more than a string of information, can contain money. And that your smartphone is the device to access that money. And that you don't need any physical token, like a creditcard, to access your money.

Regarding block 9: This is the block I'd like the least to show up for "proof". It has spent outputs (to Hal), so at least the public key is out there in the blockchain.
Of couse you are right that there's no guarantee for any of the first x unspent blocks that Satoshi mined it. 
So, back to block 9 and 1?

I don't understand the "sell miners every 8-12 weeks" part yet. Do the miners evolve that fast, hash/USD wise? Or is it for the difference between the price you paid (with rebate as you went money first) and the resale price?
Is "100 miners ordered" per miner generation, i.e. S9? And 25 is the actual capacity (infrastructure or financial wise) you have?

Way to go: Boot linux, create a 1:1 bit-identical copy with "dd" onto another harddisk. Then you have all the time in the world to try all and any methods to recover stuff from the dd image.
If you didn't shut down the computer since the incident: stop doing anything on it. Switch to another computer. Maybe there's still something in ram, cache, swap, temp, whatever.

As 'decentralized' as any other bankaccount, or any other regular exchange too. Both aren't my preferred solution neither, but absolutely necessary for adoption.

@_date: 2018-12-12 19:55:42
Agreed. And we need to be fast. Just because adoption went somewhat organic and smooth in the first 10 years, doesn't mean it will stay that calm. Coordinated attacs from politics and media might come swift and hard. And then, we need to have as many people informed about banks, fiat and crypto as possible, and as many economic and social connections with crypto as possible. Adoption. And for that, bitwala is a good temporary solution and catalysator.

As long as your btc wallet is enough, great, go for it. I used the old bitwala too, for btc-to-banktransfer payments. Was a nice service, as you said. They didn't stop it, other companies pulled the carpet under bitwalas feet.
Bitwala is in Germany. Laws and regulations are especially tough in Germany, which is why there's no Bitcoin ATMs nor exchanges (until now). Bitwala was forced to either go the regulation route and offer regulated banking services, or shut down entirely. I prefer the former,one more option to onboard new people. I don't have to use it, and will still prefer my permissionless, pseudonymous, fast, cheap, international direct Bitcoin transactions wherer possible.

I like those technical solutions!
But, in this case, and most other questions op-sec related:
It doesn't matter what technical solution you choose. Sit down half an hour, come up with any solution, and use it. That' the hard part: use that solution. Every single time. When in the library. When at home and the doorbell rings. When going to the bathroom. When on the phone, even right in front of the compuiter in question. Every. Single. Moment.
It's kind of like backups. It doesn't really matter how smart or simple your backup concept is. You just have to stick to it, and make those bloody backups as often as the concept dictates.
Now, that being said, bring on the technical concepts! :-)
I, personally, would pair my computer to some device I always have with me. A smart watch would be brilliant. Unfortunately I don't wear anything *always* on me. A small key-fob could be a compromise here.

For a localbitcoins.com trade this is easy. Seller reserves the bitcoins, or puts them even in escrow. He receives a release code. On the meeting, he can release the bitcoins to the buyers account via webpage, or by sending the release code via textmessage. They have to agree on what comes first, cash or bitcoins, though. When the bitcoins are released, both receive a confirmation mail and text. The seller receives a second, "confirmation" code. By telling the buyer this code the buyer knows the seller sent him the bitcoins. So, as a bare minimum: The seller brings a textmessage-able dumbphone and his releasecode. The buyer brings cash and knows the confirmation code.

You guys are overcomplicating this!
Why, this service is already there: **MtGox**!
You can only transfer that many bitcoins a day. I know this for bloddy sure. And banktransfers are delayed four weeks period. Except two-digit transfers. Bonus: You can cancel banktransfers any time, immediately!
You might even set a custom bitcoin withdrawal limit, like three bitcoins a day.

I have a bankaccount. And know that I have no privacy there. For now, I can't get rid of it, and can't do all my financial transactions on Bitcoin.
A bitwala bankaccount makes stuff easier for me, is less risky than my reguar bankaccount (banks close accounts on Bitcoin-related transfers), and is another nail in the coffin of all the crap we are fighting against.
Anyway, when Bitcoin won and intermediates are not needed any more, the folks of Bitwala will be with us at the party.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:19:55
Well, funny question. They already have our private keys to begin with! So you have to trust them to not steal funds, that they have their servers secure, no insider is stealing funds and so on.
Now there are webwallets where only encrypted keys are on the server, so only the user has full control over the wallet. Here you still have to trust the service that they do as advertised, and didn't put intentional or unintentional backdoors in. For that, you would need to audit the code of the (locally executed) script. And make absolutely sure that the scripts aren't updated, replaced, or load additional code.
It all boils down to trust. You always have to trust some instance. Be it MtGox, Blockchain, your Windows computer or your friendly neighbor, who does it all for you.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:05:45
The blockchain synching is no problem. The wallet synching is only a problem if you use the same wallet on different installations. Then you would probably need to rescan on the other client to learn about transactions the first client was involved with. Maybe this isn't even necessary.
Maybe a light client like Electrum handles this better, someone else has to chime in here.

You could always make "sell when the exchange rate drops by xy" orders on bitfinex.
Or, alternatively, deposit USD there and lend it out. Interest rates skyrocket too in such a bull market.

You can do these things at bitfinex for example. In case you are looking for an exchange where you have both liquidity and options to "buy/sell once the price does xy".

A local trade will most likely be anonymous for both parties. Also you get to know people interested in Bitcoin in your area.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:33:13
Any company can easily volunteer to give up anonymity: Simply make the addresses of interest public. Heck, that's one of the strong points of bitcoin, you can easily do totally transparent bookkeeping, receiving donation, spending donations!
So, do a (more) anonymous addon to bitcoin, that's enough.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:26:32
First of all, not everyone has to have the whole blockchain locally. This would be a "full node", which was the norm until lately. Nowadays, you could choose between "full node", "light node" and "webwallet". A light node doesn't have the whole blockchain. It could ask a webserver for the data it needs, or have a subset of the blockchain. The android wallet does exactly this: it only downloads and stores the parts of the blockchain it needs for the addresses it uses (plus a few random ones, for "anonymity"). You still have your private keys on your device, and nowhere else. Electrum is somewhat similar, in both points. A webwallet, to complete the list, has, obviously, both the blockchain and the private keys on a webserver (although there are more complicated and secure aproaches too here).

I don't see how datacenters are more efficient at mining. Not at all, although this is repeated over and over again.
Let's compare a huge, professional mining venture with an enthusiast running a single, middle-sized miner:
The pro pays for space, pays double the electricity for AC, pays for maintenance and administration.
The enthusiast has somewhat higher electricitycosts per KW/h, but that should still be less than the total electricity costs of the pro. Space and administration won't be calculated as costs for the enthusiast. This only leaves the initial hardware costs as a factor where the pro may pay less, in case he buys bulk or develops his own miner. I don't think this will put all enthusiasts under water (although it looks like exactly that in this very moment). Now multiply the one, lonely enthusiast by tenthousand, and here we go: the mining will never be centralized. Hopefully.
Edit: Back to topic: Very high bandwith requirements, which could be the result of dropping the 1mb limit, might drive most enthusiasts out of business. Although the affordable internet bandwith grows exponentially too, it feels like..

Well, back in april that was.
I think all of this is true - just not in a 200% per month pace. Which isn't needed, anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:01:21
Well, it's other users which loan USD for 120% per year from you. Mind you, this is "only" 0.3% per day. The borrowing user speculates that the exchange rate will rise more than 0.3% in average in the next days. This seems reasonable. But could go horribly wrong too, like seen in 2011.
Also, the borrowing user can close loans at any time, to realize gains from rising exchange rate or to cut interest losses.
In any way, you normally can't lose funds as a lender. The borrower has to have securities in his account. For example a pile of bitcoins. If the exchange rate goes down, the borrower has to pay for the losses with his securities-bitcoins. If his "bet" goes totally wrong, he is forcefully liquidated and loses it all (to his lenders).
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:14:13
I didn't hear of any case where someone played the "I held one year" card. So we are all guessing here.
I would guess you need to plausibly prove your "one year" claim. Not sure if a printed screenshot is sufficient. Not sure if they will accept anything from a "company" like the exchanges at all.
But then, at least here, you state things in your tax declaration. It's up to them to prove something wrong, or ask for a receipt.
Let's find out, eh?
This would be a nice thing to offer from exchanges. Some pre-made printout which sums everything up. Pay a fee to receive that copy in mail, with stamp and signature.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:31:16
In fact you are encouraged to use a fresh, unused address for every single transaction you do, for anonymity reasons. 
Your wallet and wallet-backup contain a "start sequence" which creates an unfinite number of addresses. So you have all covered in one single backup, even your addresses created later on are backupped already.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:37:36
You have the option to accept /0 transactions, or wait 1, 6 or 20 blocks, depending on the money involved and the risk profile. A bar won't be the first place to launch a complicated and expensive double spend attack.
Also, you can overcome that risk by using third party services. Or off-blockchain-transactions. Like paying from the customers webwallet to the merchants webwallet. Immediate confirmation with ~zero risk.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:24:08
There surely is a scientific answer to that.
Let's begin with the fact that regular calculators don't have enough digits, both for calculation and to display.
I guess you can break down all calculations to the basic math operations and convert all hex numbers to plain numbers. So you wouldn't need a calculator at all.
Just, maybe, a room full of blank paper, a book-sized step-by-step instruction, and some time. 
No, that's not a scientific answer yet ;-)

For me, personally, a linux live cd is the best solution. Comparably little hassle and very high security. The only attack vectors are personal attacks against me personally (bugs or tempest), or very very sophisticated malware infecting over my usbstick (badbios), or a generally compromitted linux live cd. Or a compromitted Armory, of course. Should any of those happen, Bitcoin has a much bigger problem than me losing some coins, so I feel reasonably secure. In fact I feel smart and evil mastermind, and all that!

There is: [bitfinex](
It's a full tradingplatform (and additionally connected to bitstamp for more volume) but has some more neat features, like "stop loss" and similar options.
As a second feature it allows margin trading, where you lend USD or BTC and speculate with that on the exchange rate.
For you, this means you can transfer USD and BTC there and lend it out to users. The interest is free-market-determined.
Currently, as the [stats]( show:
USD 	120.3961%
BTC 	3.0101%
[per year]
You define the interest you want, the amount and timespan.
[bitfinex]( pays interest. Not much on BTC, a lot more on USD.**
Using them for almost a year now, being in personal contact with the devs, I trust them.

You might confuse this with: "You can recreate every single private key once you know the master public address and a single private key". Although there might be more of those traps, in magic ECDSA land.
Why do you need the index you are talking about to begin with? In case I understand you right, and you talk about "last created address: 1ghsg" as an index. You can simply create addresses from the seed until no address created has any funds. And then scan another hundred addresses for good measure. You would have to be quite creative to still lose funds here. And even then, those "lost" bitcoins would show up eventually, when creating a new receiving address later.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:23:29
Now that's an excellent question!
It's easy(er) to prove you own an address with its bitcoins today, and then wait for a year. It's close to impossible to prove you owned an address for a year in hindsight though.
One idea is to sign a message with the address, and then have some authority put the date, stamp and signature on that.
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:55:49
When to sell?
For me, the answer is: Whenever I need money!
Use the profits when you can make good use of it. Be it a bit more luxury by buying a shiny pair of shoes, or a a bit more luxury by buying that van. I am somewhere in between these examples.
Buy bitcoin when you have money left, and sell bitcoin when you get something nice out of it. Stop worrying about hindsight, crashs and rallies, and everything is so much more pleasant!
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:50:12
Even easier, you can send the "change" staight back to the input address, which is the original paperwallet address. The Armory client has full control of inputs and outputs, for example.
You still lose 1) the offline security, and 2) the public key (which is not the address!) of the address is broadcasted.

We can't ignore old addresses or transactions, as long as there are bitcoins left, as we need the details to be able to send them around later.

The only two problems I see here:
1) importing the infamous "correct horse battery staple" key might crash your clientsoftware, because of massive usage of that key.
2) You will probably taint your "arent meant for public" addresses eventually. As soon as you create a transaction with inputs from the imported address and one of the others. Which happens fast, if you don't use "coin control" every time.
