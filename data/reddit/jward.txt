The server said they use an iPad and have a few regulars who always pay with it now.  I didn't try it out since I don't have any bitcoins on my mobile wallet.

Thanks :D  Now I have to figure out how that works!

The profit made from mining is unreasonably high at the moment.  That needs a correction.  If butterfly labs ever ships my ASIC I'll be making more per month off of bitcoins than I do from my job as a programmer easily.  
All the transactions have been buy and hold.  There isn't really any movement to use the coins.  The buyers are speculating on coins.  Even if people continue to hold onto what they've bought, some people will panic sell and it'll be a race to the bottom.
I think bitcoins are awesome, but they aren't just a bit overvalued right now.  They are ungodly overvalued.

I know, but I was there less than 2 weeks ago and it's newer than that.

It's very popular with a hippy / grunge atmosphere.  Delicious food and chai!

I don't have a lot of bitcoins, but I've been selling them off whenever I could sell 50% of my current bitcoins for $1000.  I've made so much so far.  I know I could've made more, far far more, but I've already profited greatly and I know it'll pop at some point in the future.
