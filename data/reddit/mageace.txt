Read more. Be patient. Never rush things, that includes in life.
God bless you and i hope you can find peace soon.
Only put in the amount you can lose. Never, ever put in more and get sleepless nights. This is for yourself and to have a quality of life besides cryptocurrency.
Reddit with caution, every channel supports their ideology so opinions can be very bias. 
Lastly, please go get some education cause i'm a asian and we believe in better education leads to better chances of getting employed in higher position. I know education is not everything just like money cant buy you happiness but without it, ...

Lesson number one. Never, ever use exchanges that has few to none reviews. 
Lesson number two. Never, ever do a large tx at the first time. Always do double tx, first with few, then with large. Even if you decide to shift your coins to cold wallet, always do it that way. There are many things that can go Murphy when doing purchases or shifting when it comes to cryptocurrency.

Perhaps making a "fake" impression of BTC so that Bcash can rise and shine? Coinbase is shit

Hi, i'm from Singapore as well. Yes, we cant use gdax but im using this website called coinhako. Purchase-sale 0.9%, cheaper compare with Coinbase. 
I would like to hear from Singaporeans on where they purchase their coins as well. ��
