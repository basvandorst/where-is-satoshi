We have satoshis and if it is not enough, the code can be probably extended to enable fraction of them, moreover you cannot buy my bitcoin if I do not sell them. This massive buy opetation will also attrice a global media converge, new users, new money. It will ultimately speed up adottino, go for it.

Vires is plural of vis, so it is "strengths". "vir" is Man, thanks for the correction.

Happened the same to me, for the same reasons, lost ~2€ that way.
I just rembered the PIN and didn't saved the username and password, which I do not remember. Surely a bad practice by me, but I was fine for a long time with just a PIN for less than 5€ in bitcoin.
I had a couple of "company wallet" coffee time with a friend of mine.
Then suddenly I upgraded, and lost all my wallets.

Please take a tip for your answer 500 bits @_date: 2014-09-29 12:45:19
Thanks for the answer.
But every other solution, also one like storj and any distributed filesystem or cloud backup solution out there **does not** have the feature of the blockchain.
In the blockchain nobody could delete your data and it is close to the definition of **forever** as it can.
Data put in the blockchain are there **forever** and **nobody** can delete it.
So it has a value, and IMHO it is **huge** (and costly, for sure).

Next time use something like GreenAddress + HW wallet HW1.
That way you could use it safely on a compromised computer, a keylogger isn't enough to steal btc.
Obviously you should add also 2FA for big transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-28 00:11:33
Thanks for the clear explanation, una mancetta @_date: 2014-09-17 07:26:09

I had problems with quickcoin (tried 2 months ago), lost transactions (just 0.01 btc fortunately), and messages not delivered to facebook walls.
I suspect a scam or a poorly written software.
The idea is brilliant but we need something more serious here.
@_date: 2014-09-26 09:34:08
But that way you must **trust** the other store of data you are referring by the hash.
There are application of storing actual data directly and only on the blockchain, but I cannot imagine the limitation in size per transaction and the minumum cost per byte.
Your suggested application is what is used for proof of existance. I'm suggesting a **Permanent Database**. This is something that is unique to bitcoin's blockchain I think.
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:03:06
But that is the cost of the space of the whole transaction, which are the relevant % of this exploitable for user data, leaving out the protocol parts?

That would be actually a bad idea for Changetip, that a way smaller number of users would had noticed it in the first place.

@_date: 2014-08-20 15:07:28
I try to explain where you are wrong.
All your calculation are right until:
"Market Cap x Percentage owned (of bitcoin for comparison) = $100,334,863"
You should not multiply a percentage, but a value less than 1, a ratio. (e.g. 0.12 = 12%, 0.12 is a ratio, 12% a percentage).
I cannot explain better, this is embarassing.
A percentage is a ratio times 100. Here lies your error.
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:26:32
I would like to know how much information could one fit in a transaction if the blockchain is seen as a **permanent database**.
I do not mind burning bitcoin, I just want to know how much it cost writing down random data (not only hashes a-la **proof of existance**).

«Assuming the recipient trusts the operator of the keypair to not attempt a double spend, the recipient may treat the funds as confirmed the moment they arrive.»

Bitcoin is a protocol, and protocols with estabilished network effect are not vulnerable to be superseded by small (or even large) improvements over it.
Think about IPV4 and why it is not yet superseded by IPV6 after more than 10 years even if IPV6 is hugely better.
Other cryptocurrencies simply lack the network value of Bitcoin. They are a no real threat.

With plain Bitcoin you could do at least 2 kind of micropayments:
- micropayment channels, e.g. 
- "lottery" micropayment: 
A "micropayment" for VISA, Paypal and some euro banks is anything under 20AU$, 12$ or 30€, it could be done with plain bitcoin since the fee is becoming common at 10 bits.
The micropayment channel could transfer 1 satoshi at time, so, really fine grained.
It should be enough for anyone ;-)

You want to include "popularity" in the "easily transactable" property, they are two different concepts. I could agree that "popularity" or "availability to find a trader" could be another interesting line to add.

Trader's availability:
moderate | high | low
And another line too about adoption among population growing :
Adoption growth:
none | none | moderate

Moreover, the nlocktime value is customizable before each transaction (it will be part of the "address" of the P2SH script), so you choose your level of trust in GreenAddress future availability, more granulary as you could want, probably.
After each coming transaction, GA could send the nlocktime pre-signed transaction.

@_date: 2015-01-17 11:05:58
You are not screwed, you just have a transaction pre-signed by them.
You still have your keys, you are just not "subscribed" to some features, which you could re-enable istantly by clicking a button, if GreenAddress is still around; or you could simply move your funds without GreenAddress intervention in whatever technology will be comfortable at that time, since you have a pre-signed transaction.
Simple as that.

The most trafficked ones (pubs and restaurants) actually keeps the bitcoin received and do not sell to fiat, they spend them in the valley, also to pay wages and to pay their suppliers who accepts bitcoin (still a few, do not overdream ;-)).
I know that because I installed most of them at the "beginning" of merchant phase in Italy in the late 2014 and then started a company in 2016 also for this; in the Bitcoin Valley the great majority of the bitcoin accepting venues are using our systems.

"Resilient" is not correct. Bitcoin develops stronger after chaos, drama, volatility and forks. Bitcoin is 'antifragile'.
Anti-fragile in Taleb's way. I noticed not so many people are confortable with this term and confuse it with 'resilient' or even with 'robust'.
"Anti-fragile" could be imagined as a system that when an injury received: is not without effect ('robust') or just repaired ("resilient"), but that the system, after each repaired blow, grows stronger; after many blows it becomes immune to that kind of threat.
To see how it could go let's define regarding Bitcoin governance how it could be either 'fragile', 'robust' and 'anti-fragile':
'fragile': just Satoshi Nakamoto version of software, 1 official bitcoin core running forever, closed source
'robust': a pool of devs with build-time consensus, 1 official bitcoin core running forever, open source
'anti-fragile': a pool of competing Bitcoin full-nodes maintained by different groups, just runtime consensus (1 Blockchain)

UPDATE: I recovered my 128€ and I found the bug. It is real and easely fixed probably.
To recover I asked the guy if it had stills the screenshots trials and it did. Using the really first one on a fresh breadwallet recovered my funds.
So, what happened ?
If you screenshot the phrase, another mnemonic is generated, but the software 'caches' the first generated address (and qrcode) for the first one, even if you generate other mnemonics.
So this is a BIG BUG, the displayed address should be generated by the latest mnemonic or the funds sent to this address could be lost forever.
I was lucky that the guy still had the (wrong) screenshots and not deleted them. (The real mnemonic is safe, wrote via pencil, but it does not control that lost address generated via a "overwritten" mnemonic).
So I stand my point: BEWARE.

I just presented bitcoin to a guy that gave me 128€ for that amount, he just installed breadwallet, tried to screenshot the mnemonic, failed, clicked somewhere, another mnemonic popup, he wrote that down, pressed 'done' a qrcode showed up, I sent 128€ in bitcoin to him, never arrived on the wallet. Even with some 'blockchain rescan'.
Other qrcode showed by breadwallet but the first worked fine (I tried then with smaller amounts, my mistake to not having tried this before as usual). Sending money worked, but that single payment, even after some confirmations, never showed up on that wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:43:55
I did have wrote down the last mnemonic it showed, only after that I sent money to a qrcode.

Just downloaded, clicked twice for mnemonic by mistake, wrote it down, clicked ok, it showed a qrcode, sent 0.49 btc, never arrived.
I then tried sending to different addresses that showed up small amounts (I always try that first but that one time) and it worked. Restarted blockchain twice, nothing.
Lost forever due a never saw "first qrcode that I show you is wrong" bug in Breadwallet.

@_date: 2015-08-04 18:28:00
Correct, it issued a warning. No problem with that, the problem is that it showed a wrong QRcode with 'receive' well written. (probably from the first generated mnemonic, dunno).
A bitcoin wallet should never permit to lose money. First feature.
And we used it properly (I did not do any mistake in UX, I wrote it down the mnemonic), so I lost money only on wallet's fault.

I think is the opposite that happens: kids explaining bitcoin to adults.
I was at a dinner with some friends, one of the adults said at one point: "this bitcoin is really difficult to understand"; my 6 years old son said instantly: 'no. it is easy, it is money at a distance" (lit: 'no, è facile, sono soldi a distanza').
We all stared at him surprised...

@_date: 2015-08-04 19:40:06
we haven't clicked past the warning, we had carefully wrote with a pen and paper the mnemonic, then we clicked 'done', and the first qrcode shown was wrong. I have no screenshots of previous mnemonic.

BEWARE, legit usage here:
"Long chains of unconfirmed transactions" could be used to embed data in the blockchain by using as a "chain ring" a transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs: one for the OP_RETURN data and the other to link to the next chain ring.
In some use cases, you will not need a fast confirmation and you could inject all the chain in the network and wait 1 day to settle.
I can think a lot of applications that could use that transaction chain to store valuable information in The Blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:57:19
Ok, but the funds are still not 'immediately available'', the merchant cannot spend the 0.05 btc to another 'address' if the TXID is not final.
I know he still receives the money even if the TXID is not final, but he cannot spend them right away. He needs at least one confirmation (to spend the previous unspent output).

How many Watts it uses while mining?

You already can, by using something like Bitwage, without the need to even mention about "bitcoin" to your boss.

No, you cannot, the blockchains  are not in sync

Very nice, congrats!

How about SPV?
BWS is a single point of failure and is not 'decentralized' in most ways.

Please, tell me how it will spread in a p2p network and how it will end in the longest chain. 
Not an issue

Yes, probably a mountain party in my zone.

Yes I did, but you are assuming I'm against GMO. I'm not.

Why you need to buy now ?
You should had bought when it was at 200$, not when is rising for the sense of greed and missed opportunity that you feel.
This is why people ends buying on highs and sells on lows.

Putting teenagers in Jail sounds so Dark Ages, but USA has death penalty too, so it is not so surprising.

Both your points are really insightful, DACs are not only just allowed by Bitcoin Technologies, but Bitcoin itself is a DAC.
It's running without a CEO or a Founder, and its success is fully volountary and decentralized.

Android Wallet has a default of 10 bits fee, so around 0.3 $cents.
This should beat it.

Congratulation Lawrence! You and your work are really great!

Bitpay adoption leads to Bitcoin adoption, not only functionally but also psychologically. It prints in simple minds the equation: "bitcoin = real money".
I saw a lot of Bitpay merchants converting and buying bitcoin after just a few weeks on 100% conversion to fiat.

Happened to me too one month ago.
250€ came to my one of my addresses from nowhere

One of the best insight on the matter, a must read.

As Italians we are a bit against it, we prefere real Pizzerie or preparing it at home, but for some incredible series of coincidences, there is really a Pizza Vending Machine Company based in Rovereto, the centre of the Bitcoin Valley. They only sell those machines to foreign countries obviously. Nobody here really would want one. If there is really a market for those horrors I can contact them and it will be done in a small amount of time.
