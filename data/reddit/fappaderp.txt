how does this happen? Does someone actually call the support number popup on a website and let them remote desktop your machine?

HODLers from 2010: How did you first hear about or get involved with bitcoin?

Millions will predict varying levels of value. Only a few will get it right and be quoted on it. The rest will be forgotten. The reality is that you stand to lose nothing by making a prediction so anyone can.

If SODL Bear hadn't hesitated when first thinking about switching lines, it would have been done halfway into this .gif.

To play the \(less pitchforky\) devil's advocate: News outlets can opt to gamble original content views by posting it at the opportune moment as opposed to "first". They may have chosen to post it when their social analytics tool flagged that a relevant keyword was starting to trend,  for example.

Many people in the crypto community who tout their coin's whitepaper have absolutely no idea what they are looking at on this stream but will pretend they do until they have your money.

I would \*highly\* recommend ***against*** this if it's not your property as:
1. You are tagging public or private property without consent. Street art is anonymous, however...
2. You are now personally identifiable through both website and a traceable wallet which...
3. Adds money into the mix, thus, increased the level of severity should someone pursue this
I love the artwork as the spray turned out great, however, the city could charge you, arrest you, and make an easy case to drain your wallet even if it's meant to be art.

Up through the early 2000s, McDonalds had been pretty good at keeping the cheeseburger and hamburger under 50 cents, though. After that, nope.

 Can the last full bitcoin technically be mined or is mining it some curve with an asymptote?

Would be curious to see the actual usage statistics for these machines.
