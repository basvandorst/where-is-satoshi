For me its not that. I personally think that the price of bitcoin is going to fall soon

Yo no need to be a douche. I took econ and am studying a major that is highly influenced by economics so I know supply/demand; I'm not a dumbass. There are other factors involved that make me think this. Miners are probably getting scared of bitcoin's long term ability as a currency because of the government's attack on it. Also there is a real risk of the biggest bitcoin market being shut down in the near future (the Silk Road). If I was a miner I would think, "Hey, it's getting too hard to mine more bitcoin, and now is a good price to sell at. I'm going to take my money and walk away."
Not saying I'm right but I have a valid opinion that you should respect and I really don't like being talked to like I'm dumb.

Cool just figured it out! I want to tip you but I don't have any coin currently and I'm not looking to buy at this price

I think that since the mining difficulty is so high there's going to be a crash soon

I know those 2 things have nothing to do with difficulty increase, but they contribute to my opinion. And the amount of interest in miners is at its peak. I think the interest is going to go down soon.
And again, it is possible to tell me all this without being a douche...
