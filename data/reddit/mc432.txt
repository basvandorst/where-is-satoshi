That sucks, I still dont get why so many people trusted a exchange that had known problems for over a year, especially with that amount of money. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:42:44
That response was like a nuke on the thought part of the brain.

Very disapointing.  Im a bit confused by him and Alex jones. Seems they have a very negative stance on bitcoin.  Also doesnt the health ranger accept bitcoin on his site?  You would think he could at least lie a little better what a tool. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:02:47
Ha, that was funny. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:00:46
I don't get the impression that Schiff understands bitcoin at all. I think he is just trying to capitalize of the bitcoin crowd. Nothing wrong with that. I personally would not want to buy gold from someone like that.

This is something along the lines of what I was thinking. They are just puppets for gold dealers. Which will also be threatned by bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:09:02
Because violence fixes everything. Smh. How about people accept responsibility for the risk they took trusting a shady exchange.

I agree with this 100%. Dogecoin makes crypto fun and not so serious . Also even though its not know if doge will succed long term imo people like the idea of having a lot of something. 1000 doge instead of .00009 btc or whatever the rate is. Its going to be a interesting how it all plays out over the comming years.

@_date: 2014-07-01 14:41:35
Why not just use the original bitcoin client. You don't need to download the blockchain to create a wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:56:33
Nice, couldn't agree more. Although, its surprising how many people are terrified to walk around that.

Some are really afraid of exploring anything new in life or taking risks. Some are deathly afraid of change. Especially when confronted with changing a system which they depend on to survive. Most people have only known of money as one thing. Something the government gives you. I say try not to let it bother you just smile and do what you do and one day they will see or not. Thats my 2

While anything is possible. I belive they jsut match buyers and sellers, you can see the orders for both sides. Its in their best interest to help customers make transactions so they can profit..  If they were manipulating prices they would go out of business and loose customers fast.  I have often wounered if they do manipulate the supply of sll to their advantage. Its hard to say and I have personally never had any problems with their service.

A interesting comparison I think would be to take one stock exchange out of many around the globe.  The New York stock exchange for example has 2308 listings and has a market cap of  16 trillion.    The whole crypto currency market has only about 200 cryptos being traded with a market cap of 6 billion or so.   It will take time but the crypto currency market in general could grow to this size or much bigger than 16 trillion imo.

Why not just use the bitcoin client on a offline computer and dump the private key in the console.  Save it in a text file and put it on a encrypted usb stick. Thats what I do anyways.

@_date: 2014-03-21 16:24:00
I say yes. You can buy a 60gh miner on ebay for about 450, this will make about 120 per month. It will take about 4-12 months to break even. It is a risky investment but if exchange rate keeps rising over the next year or too you will def make your money back plus some.  just know that Its not a get rich quick investment, more a hold the head steady and milk the cow.  Do a lot of research and compare miners. Dont do preorders. Thats my 2 bits. Goodluck 
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:46:09
With bitcoin you can't force people to pay for wars, or systems of death and destruction.  Through inflation of the dollar I have no choice but to pay for war.  Track me all they want, they will have to pry my keys from my cold dead brain wallet.

If It was my money I would invest half into scrypt mining, the rest just buy bitcoin on an exchange. Good luck though.

@_date: 2015-03-20 23:43:37
I'd recommend buy a few dollars worth of dogecoin and practice importing and exporting keys to and from cold storage.  That way if you mess up there is no big loss. Then you will have more experience in cold storage.  I also get my keys and addresses from a wallet installed on a computer that isnt connected to the internet. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:17:40
Who cares. If no one was forced why does it really matter. Some people just like to take big risks.

For a interesting possibility compare the alt coin markets to say the New York Stock exchange. Currently the New York Stock exchange has 1867 listing and a market cap of about 25 trillion dollars. There are many stocks listed that are just garbage, with no earnings.
  I hold the opinion that the cryptocurrency markets can reach a size comparable to this with many of the shit coins still trading at values unthinkable at the moment. 
The NYSE is only one of may exchanges with trillion dollar plus market caps. The crypto currency markets as a whole is only worth about 4 billion. I think there is quite a bit of room to grow. Just be aware that there is a risk it could all go to zero.
