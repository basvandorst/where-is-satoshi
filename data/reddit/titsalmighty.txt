Because Bitcoin has a bad rep. But there is no blockchain without Bitcoin (or another currency) to incentivize securing the network.

bitcoin doesn't fall 90% "all the time". I'm saying it has before and that didn't spell death, so there's little reason to assume a ~20% fall over a month is a death knell. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:53:24
Or maybe you buy emotionally and are swayed too much by popular sentiment. Maybe when everyone's yelling about the moon it's time to sell, and maybe when everyone is saying bitcoin is dead is the time to buy.

It was lack of common sense because as you admit yourself 2FA would have prevented it. What's the point of tails and TOR if you 2FA is enough to protect you.

You realize bitcoin has fallen 90% before and recovered more than fine? This is a tiny slow drop compare to what bitcoin used to do

Realize this is kind of an old thread, but you really need to listen to your users and change this. I loved everything about bread EXCEPT this awful requirement. Just deleted the app off my phone and won't be using it again until, which is a shame because it had a lot going for it. When your users are telling you repeatedly that something needs to be changed, you really need to listen.

So because it's popular means it's not stupid? That makes no sense, there's a lot of idiots. And the person OP is referring to didn't even have 2FA set up. If you use and web wallet without two factor, you're being an idiot plain and simple. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:25:36
That's the big disconnect between the nerdy early adopters and the eventual mass market. The mass market needs "good enough" security that is simple and easy to set up and understand. The more savvy and paranoid will always have cold storage and paper wallets and laser engraved titanium placards buried in a lead box in rural Alaska, but if we ever want my mom or my dad or even my friends to adopt bitcoin it's gonna have to get a whole lot simpler.

You are saying the same thing I am. We can have banks built on BTC, and easy to use wallet hosts, etc., but those all in one way or another compromise one of Bitcoin's strengths. There are people who would think you are a moron for keeping coin in an online wallet because it isn't as secure as a laser engraved fireproof cold storage tablet. But the only road to mass adoption is by embracing "good enough" security in the name of greater ease of use. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:21:45
No it's not, read a fucking book. 30% assets in a high risk high reward asset class is not unreasonable if you have the risk tolerance for it. I'd suggest you learn even the basics of investing and asset allocation before you judge others and form ignorant opinions.

If you lose bitcoins because you had a web wallet without two factor authorization, then expect to be given a hard time for not doing one of the simplest and most effective things you can do to protect your web wallet. You can do everything right and still get robbed, but 9 times out of 10 these people did things far from right
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:07:25
There is a growing struggle between those trying to make Bitcoin accessible to the mass market, and those who believe that doing so destroys what is special about Bitcoin. 
Unfortunately you can't have it both ways. 
Mainstream Bitcoin will mean compromising on decentralization, advanced security, and anonymity. I don't see any way around that. I think the pros of mass Bitcoin adoption greatly outweigh the cons of compromise, but I'm sure many other disagree.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:21:16
If you want widespread adoption you have to accept that most users aren't going to bother with complex security techniques. The next best alternative is a relatively idiot proof, highly secure third part option
