You are the one that should be "rubbing a few brain cells together". You don't know they are gone, yet you assert they are

Bcash doesn't have segwit, which means they don't get lightning network. And lightning is probley the main reason why bitcoins price is what it is right now. Bcash is a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:27:54
It has. But your bcash propaganda will not be effective here. Run along.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:15:04
Because with lightning network.... **WE CAN**.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:12:31
Bitcoin is not for you. You want the shitcoin called "bcash". Goodbye.

"our money"
This is the problem. You decided to share income and now this is your life.

Stop watching porn, take control of your life

Theoretically you only need 1 guy mining for it to work
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:23:18
Was the money destroyed then or is it still inflation?
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:20:45
So the dollar isn't a viable currency since it has lost 99% of its value?

The particles need to be together to entangle them, then when you move them apart and read them you can only get 1 bit out of them. It's total sensationalism. Take 2 bags and put a white stone in one and a black stone in another and mix them up so you don't know which is which. Now move them a billion miles apart and look at one of them. You instantly know what is in the other bag a billion miles away. That is the exactly identical thing they are doing

I started buying weekly last year in may when the price was $9,780. At one point I was down 50% but now I'm up 60%. I love this strategy

Robinhood must be buying to fill their orders, if the price skyrockets it would be suicide for them if they didn't have any

Here is a better metric, if 1% of the world all want bitcoin there is only enough for them to have about .27 each
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:03:37
I emailed them because I would definitely NOT use them if they weren't holding any bitcoin and this was their response.

Just stupidity is all.

You wouldn't, keep stacking

Robinhood told me that they hold the bitcoin that people buy, some will suggest that they have nothing and it's fake but that isn't true. Though you can't currently withdraw it

21 million capped supply, if 1% of people want bitcoin there is only enough for them to have about .27 each

the only problem is that you think those keys arnt lost, (they are)
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:01:04
the keys are lost, stop being delusional
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:44:08
You have no bitcoin, you wish you had bitcoin

My computer can do about 1 million simple calculation in python per second. So to have about a 50% chance of getting the right combination it would take me 9,837,144,877 years
