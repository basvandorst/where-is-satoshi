But on a separate chain/ledger, no? To be settled on the Bitcoin blockchain at a later time. Who then do we trust to run the lightning network since it'll be separate from the blockchain?
P.S. I don't fully understand the lighting network so thats a sincere question. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:46:39
It is literally in it's alpha stage. The vast majority of people using "the Altcoin" right now are developers. So I'm not surprised that the majority of the mining power is with one pool.
As far as issues with mining go, "the Altcoin" won't have as drastic of a problem with ASIIC mining taking over.

You're right, it has to do with economists working on the paper not the fed. But the fact that the fed would publish this study gives it weight. If the fed looked over the methodology and content and thought it was worth putting their name on, the authors gain legitimacy in my eyes.

@_date: 2018-01-17 02:52:17
Deluding ourselves? The federal reserve just published a paper that claimed Bitcoin is more robust than some fiat currencies, has multiple practical use cases, and is poised to become an important asset class. The exact things you claim we're delusional about. So if you're claiming that this isn't the case and the fed paper my post was about is wrong, at least make some sort of argument.

Why would I choose a crytpo that has $1-$2 fees and a backlog of transactions when there are a half a dozen other cryptos that have a fraction of those fees and can confirm my transaction in mere minutes.
Trying to twist the problem faced by Bitcoin into something good is plain dishonest and reeks of not being able to accept reality.

TBH they have far more posts on technical stuff than here. But I assume that's mostly because it's vastly smaller.

Don't understand why people are giving you shit on here. You obviously are a fan of Bitcoin considering your past writings and work.
People here need to understand that Ethereum and Bitcoin aren't necessarily competitors. I keep most of my crypto-investments in Bitcoin because it's a better store of value but spend most of my time tinkering with Ethereum because you have great tech for smart contracts.
But thanks for being willing to take some heat to straighten out some misconceptions about Ethereum on here.

How does it show ETH at $5? It hasn't dipped below $7 in the past 7 days. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:13:01


That may be true, but AFAIK it was never outlined in Satoshi's white paper. 
For the block size, it's a hard cap on how much gas can be spent in a block and the miners vote on that gas limit. If they start to see a genuine increase in activity, they vote the gas limit up so they can start collecting more gas fees per block. It doesn't need a hardfork or softfork to scale.


Look up Ethereum's uncle system. It's a cool way of producing fast blocks securely (assuming low-latency between nodes). But regardless of how it's done, Ethereum currently has fast transactions at a fraction of the cost of Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin has always been advertised as near instant payments with cheap fees. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that this is no longer the case (at least until lighting network anyway). This is definitely and advantage Ethereum has over Bitcoin, and something Bitcoin will technically get with the lightning network. 


That may be true, but this was a part of the Ethereum protocol from the get go. Ethereum was always suppose to be a multi-token/multi-cryptocurrency ecosystem (see the current debate on economic abstraction). The concept of many different tokens was a major part of Ethereum, whereas with Bitcoin it was a side idea after the fact. 


First, I'd definietly recommended checking out IPFS. It's really cool! Second, this just shows how comparing the two doesn't work. Ethereum is trying to be web 3.0. The goal of swarm and IPFS is to be able to have a internet similar to what we have now, but on a decentralized, censorship free blockchain. I doubt Bitcoin would adopt this because of the requirements to even implement it. It could be beneficial though. The extra storage space could be used for larger, decentralized smart contracts once SegWit or RootKit gets smart contracts on Bitcoin. I can also imagine an Openbazzar type of thing where the stores can exist on the Bitcoin chain rather than a separate one.

So thank's to the sneakpeekbot, we can see the top three posts on are a comic that pokes fun at Ethereum and The DAO, a YouTube video that was taken down (I think it was satire IIRC), and a well written statement from Vitalik on the DAO fork where he advocated for a decentralized consensus on what to do. Doesn't exactly sound like 1984 or double think.
And no, he doesn't put his name on every "boiler room scheme." Vlad has been the face of Ethereum over the past few months with his History of Casper blog series.

Mostly on Bitcoin because of network effect, largest development team, largest economy, etc. Bitcoin isnt worth what it is due to speculation alone, although it is one of the largest factors influencing price. Here us a good summary as to why Bitcoin has inherent value:  
I also diversify amongst other alt coins like Ethereum, in case the 10% is significantly on there, as I think it will be. Fun fact, banco santander is making an ethereum token on the public chain that is redeemable for money at their bank.
And crypto is just as much gambling as stocks or securities. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:14:56
Bitcoin wasn't envisioned as a smart contracts platform upon inception but Ethereum was.
I think their memory hard take on PoW would solve Bitcoins problem of miner consolidation due to ASIC mining. But I don't know if Ethereum was the first to come up with that. The way their blocks scale dynamically in size would fix many headaches in the Bitcoin community right now. Ethereum's 12 second block times and low transaction fees would make Bitcoin a viable payment network again. Ethereum's ability to easily create tokens that can represent anything that can also be programmed on how they work is a cool idea. Ethereum's implementation of swarm and IPFS for distributed file sharing/storage allows for many things that are impossible with Bitcoin.
