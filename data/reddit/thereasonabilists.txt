Based on what is this 'patently absurd'?


Coin-Dance probably put a lot of thought in collecting and presenting this data. I never suggested otherwise.
But if I follow the Coinbase 'ready' link it leads to a list of companies and there is says that Coinbase has planned to support technically. Nothing more nothing less.
If I follow 'yes' links I get sent to explicit statements that these companies want segwit.
I agree that one does not exclude/include the other. But for me it is not clear what the actual political support is (be it 46%, 23% or 91%).

Thanks for the reply.
I would suggest adding a category 'supports and ready' (or something like that).
There can be two links, one to show the political support and one to show the (planned/wip/implemented) technical support. That way in the top bar it will be more clear what is actually meant. 
That way is is clear that 'ready' means the technical side (if that is indeed the case right now). 
(And while we are at it :), I would not just include the weight itself but also on what it is based or some links for further reading if you want to find out)

Why is their status 'ready' then and not 'support'? Genuine question because I don't know.
And if it is obvious a large majority of these companies supports Segwit why aren't all these 'ready' companies in 'support'?

Thank you! I learned something about opportunity cost. I am neither an economist nor a manufacturer and hadn't thought about it this way.

ASICBOOST aside, they are a company that produces and sells mining hardware. They sell this hardware with a profit margin (I don't know how high this margin is) and can use their own hardware at cost price. You know this going in and this is how a lot of ASIC producing companies operate so it is never about being fair. It is about making money as mining should be.

Or no stance could just mean that, no stance. We do not know.

I really like this attitude!
In addition to this, mining is a way to get bitcoin without going through an exchange or local bitcoins.
Just don't assume you will earn a profit with mining nowadays.

I did not downvote your post and I did not take your post as advice. I am sorry if it came across that way.
I just wanted to reiterate that people do not have to respond in the same manner.
@_date: 2017-04-23 18:36:35
Yes, It thought as much but I am wondering why there are not more companies that have a 'support' status instead of 'ready'.
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:01:10


Why is this type of reaction necessary?

The site is a bit iffy. But it says no tickets are needed, only registration by email. (Actually: "Send us an email at register if you want to know more about registration.")

If you sell now (with a profit margin) you have guaranteed profits.
Hooking them up and mining will create possible future profits but mining hardware deprecates fast and stuff can go wrong.

I agree that these polls are oversimplifying the issue and can be influenced. So using them with the title like in this thread is not helping the debate. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 04:37:58
In the poll it says 'Won't say'. So we don't know.
@_date: 2017-04-24 06:51:15
I think you make some good points but you are poking the bear sometimes :)


This quote, for example, implies there are big bad actors trying to destroy bitcoin. Thinking like this does not help imho. I think everyone in bitcoin should protect their own interest. If you have more money invested you will try harder. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:41:53
Pointing out a title is misleading does not imply BU support.
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:51:23
Difficult, yes. If a post is just mudslinging and purposefully rude I tend to downvote and ignore it. If you keep reacting the cycle never stops.
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:05:35
The point is that stating 91% in the title of the post suggests 91% explicit support (as in "we want it").
I think what is trying to say that you can have the technical side in support of segwit ready (just in case it activates) but you do not care if it actually activates. It makes sense from a business stand point to be prepared for segwit. 
That is the problem with such a poll. It condenses the complex issue into a couple of numbers. And coinbase, with apparent biggest weight, for example has stated in the past it supports segwit but in this poll it just says 'ready'. So what is it? And how would this influence the result?
@_date: 2017-04-23 18:34:46
Seriously, where does he/she state he/she is supporting BU?
And how is his/her reply FUD? 
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:21:29
I am reading the links about the subject now.
As I understand it the split-off point is the moment the miner is built.
The sell as is revenue is the sale price of the miner.
The process further revenue is everything you can earn by using the miner yourself.
The additional costs are electricity fees.
As I understand it you are saying process further revenue is infinite. I think this is not the case since the mining revenue is bound due to the difficulty increase and bitcoin price not keeping up. This was why I added the calculation.

It is a distributed network, not a company that can decide what happens. If some party creates a client and a (slighly) different protocol and can get the majority (90%+) of miners and users on board then that will be bitcoin.
Right now there is no such client so nothing changes which is not good. Trying to forcing it either way is not good either. 
Again, I am not pro or con anything and I think a solution is needed that gets the majority of users and miners on board.

While you put up your fists for an honorable duel, your opponents may fling mud at your face or shake your hand while their friend hits you from behind.
That does not mean I have to do the same as my 'opponent'.

I have no idea what sell-or-process-further is exactly. But a miner will likely not generate infinite income (and in current conditions certainly not infinite bitcoin), even if you let it run infinitely long.
The hashrate at least tripled year by year in the past years. So your daily income will be 1/3 of what it was last year on the machine. If you assume this goes on like this in the foreseeable future (it cannot go on indefinitely), this means a decrease of about 0.3% per day (a daily factor of about 0.997). Even with an infinite number of mining days if you add them all up is 1 / (1 - 0.997) approx 333 times what you earn today.
Of course there are a some assumptions here. This calculation is valid if the growth in hashrate continues at its current pace, the block reward + fees income stays the same as they are today.
If bitcoin price keeps rising exponentially and/or fees will rise exponentially to compensate the lower amount of bitcoin you may generate infinite income (but the miner will break soon enough :)

I don't know if and how that affects this poll. But 46% (in number) apparently explicitly says they support it. 
There are also exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp of which it is unknown what they support. So fear of a ddos will not force you to support segwit. (It might stop you from supporting an alternative). 
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:27:06
Being ready for something and wanting it are different things.
So translating 46% support and 42% ready into 88% wants it is misleading. 
But yes, 46% of these companies explicitly support segwit which is more than explicit support for the current alternatives. (Although the numbers are different when you enable 'economic weighing', however that is determined.)
