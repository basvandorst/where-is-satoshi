I was genuine though, well done. It would be a great feeling!
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:07:43
Oooooh. Ok. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:09:38
You're quite proud that, judging by your multiple posts. Well done though.

long time no see

I'm not a mod here, I can't change anything unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:27:56
Yeah I never use Nightmode so don't really account for it but I shall mess around with it.

Sounds like you might have a RAT installed. They can be hidden in just about anything with the right encryptor. Someone may have sent you a picture, a document, a pdf, a video, anything, and it could have been hidden inside. 
These are often used to access your passwords  browsers history, view your webcam, watch your desktop (and anything you do on your pc). It's literally taking control of your pc without you even knowing it. 
The scary part  is that even people that don't know shit about 'hacking'  can gain access to these tools and infect people with no trouble at all. 
It's also hard to find the infected files once they are installed. Since they are encrypted, anti malware and virus scanners don't detect them straight away, and by the time they do detect them, they can essentially remotely uninstall the detected server and install a new undetected one whenever your pc is online.

Look up Sandboxie, use it for when you receive files from people you don't fully trust.

I think you're right. One example; I'm Australian - things like Google Music and Pandora aren't available here and a lot of music (and most other forms of entertainment) is ridiculously overpriced here. I understand the minimum wage in Australia is higher than the US but hell, I don't earn nearly enough to justify paying the price we are forced to.
So I torrented music.
Then I found spotify. I happily pay my monthly subscription for that, and I don't torrent music any more.
The lesson; give us affordable avenues to access these services and most of us **are** willing to pay.

Awesome, cheers!
Sounds good man! Talking about repurposing, is helped me out quite a lot in the past and is **very** talented with CSS and reddit styling, so I'll give him a message and see if he is interested. Fingers crossed ;)
Looking forward to this!

Pretty sure that 'neckbeard' is going to be swimming in the poon soon.

Scratch that design, I'm working on something completely fresh. I'll post the mockup when I'm done. Suits this sub better than what I've got.
Do you mind that I'm using some of your graphics? I could definitely use your help setting this up, if you know CSS?
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:49:39
No problem and good luck! Sorry to hear about your misfortune. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:07:14
I know :(
Just want to say... I love your name.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:02:03
Here's what I've got so far :)
[What do you think?](
Yeah, you're right. Bit silly if we do this and no one wants it. But I suppose at least if we use it, we can release it for other subs to use :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:00:23
Ahh, more O_o Thank you :P - I've only recently set up my wallet, even though I've been watching Bitcoin for a couple of years, so these two tips are officially my first coins. Cheers!
I think that would be a great idea and I would love to help :) I don't really know what I can do in terms of marketing Bitcoin, but making things look pretty is something I can definitely get on board with :P

I'm waiting for Despair.... right?

On the contrary, over at - we release our game over torrent because it helps distribute what would be next to impossible to distribute on our own.
*note: we are not a money making operation, so this is a little outside the spectrum you are talking about*.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:45:25
Go for it :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:34:16
[I modified it a bit](
And in the interest of keeping things open, [here's the PSD if anyone else would like to contribute]( :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:32:09
I think he meant "note".
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:11:40
Haha that is perfect timing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:02:05
That definitely reads out to
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:15:55
Oh wow, thanks. You didn't have to do that :)
