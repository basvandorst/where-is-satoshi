I wonder why it's so hard for people to grasp that there is no such thing as "intrinsic value"? They think if it has value for me, then it is valuable and that's that. Interesting.
The same applies to meaning. Does anything have intrinsic meaning? But so many people cling savagely to the belief that various events and actions have ultimate meaning. Strange.

Sorry but you are still a bit mistaken. A edible thing is only edible to some particular creature and for that creature it has value. The other creatures who have no use for bread do not value it. The value of anything exists exclusively in the minds of those who can make use of it and nowhere else. Thus it is said that no thing has intrinsic value.
The exact same thing goes for meaning by the way. Nothing has an intrinsic meaning. All meaning exists exclusively in the minds of those who create it.

Nailed it as far as I'm concerned!

I used the services of the vendor OP refers to on 2 occasions with complete success, albeit enormous "fees". They were quick and did as they claimed.
When I clicked on OP's link above, I got a 404 Error page. Not good, right? 
When I just wrote in the domain name (bitcoinbycc.com), this appears:
which is a website "relocation" notice saying their new web site can be found at  I think cryptxchange is well known as reliable at this time though I don't really know much. However cryptxchange doesn't seem to have *anything at all * to do with the previous website at bitcoinbycc.com.
The form also says this:
The email address bitmaster30 is no longer in use by the owner of this site! Please send all emails to management only.
Anyway, this looks fishy to me. What do you make of it? I'm a raw beginner and have only used the company referred to by OP both times.
Thanks for your attention.

Your profanity is mild and well-earned, IMH.
I've been trying too and my experiences have been  similar. 
Are you really going to use Bitstamp or is there another you know of and can recommend?

OMFG. What do you make of this? What's the connection between and the actual silk road? I'm guessing the mods have sensed danger but can't imagine what it might be.

Can you recommend a more reliable and user-friendly bitcoin merchant? I'm not trying to invest my life's savings now. I just want to buy a couple hundred and see how things go so the simpler the better. Thanks.
