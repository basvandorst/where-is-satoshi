Since 2013 I must have seen this stupid pic at least a thousand times. I should have bought 100$ worth of BTC each time.. will start to do so from now on.

I guess like most: till 1BTC = 1LAMBO

price goes up: someone will post this pic   
price goes down: someone will post this pic

if the market tanks further, the LAMBO factory might be out of business by the end of 2018
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:58:40
at least they did not cut the power for the light bulbs..
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:00:57
what will happen? LAMBO factory workers will have to work double shifts

I heard that china itself is just a rumor

why should they invest in expensive mining gear if they already have their high-end money printing machine. the one they used to print a -super-dollar, that was even of better quality than the „real“ dollar..

only in the desert, if solar-powerd!

Whats the point in diversifying: all coins going down :)

on the other hand, some of the chart analysis around here sounds like a description of some fancy wine. often quite poetic.

I guess you just have to wait. Support simply does not answer tickets.

Try Bitstamp, for me this exchange works smoothly since 2013. You get approved within a day, Fiat transfer (within Europe) takes 1 day, they are registered and insured. Support never took more than a day to answer. 2013 I got deeply burned by MtGox &amp; Bitcoin24, with Bitstamp I had not one problem ever since.

great idea for a new ScamCoin, thermo nuclear bunker crypto, fallout safe, network powered by hand cranked devices, meanwhile premined on a solar powered farm in Arizona
