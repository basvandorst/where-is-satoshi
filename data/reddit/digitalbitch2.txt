We are not going downhill, but we are not going uphill fast either. Loads of problems still exist, but you would be a blithering idiot not to expect it.

I sent R80 BTC to a friend at zero cost. So I don't know what you did.

It is one of the biggest supermarkets in South Africa. And had some stores in Australia at some point. Typical Northerner who thinks Africa is a country.

I read the first sentence then I knew the rest will be bullshit. Don't waste my time.
*I have lived overseas. It is not that special or hard to leave. I don't understand if you hate us so much why are you staying.

No we don't.

You can have a capitalist dictatorship like Russia or back in the day Chile. Communism is a economic system  so they are very different. But downvote anyway because someone disagrees.

People like you are not realistic about South Africa. The leavers are the biggest complainers. They just love to complain about South Africa even if they haven't been here for twenty years. I don't take much stock in those opinions anymore. We are a country that got built and damaged by apartheid. Now it is actually slowly but surely getting better for everyone. There are bad things happening and fucking great things.

Wow, a day early too.

Except it will never be done right because the central control socialism requires ultimately turns into dictatorships or oligarchies. You need capitalism with a strong social support.

I suggest you live in the main cities of South Africa.

This doesn't make sense. Is the dollar shutdown too?
