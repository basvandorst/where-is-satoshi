If you have *any* source for that I would be facinated. (and then take it to To most of Europe the US was a rebellious English colony that was a valuable trade route, *waaay* over there on the other side of the ocean. Some like France supported us.
You seem to be talking about the Articles of Confederation, more than the Constitution. And until the last 70 or so years the US was very isolationist. (with the exception of westward expansion) Our military and industrial supremacy is largely due to the outcome of WWI and WWII where every other industrialized nation got flattened and had to rebuild while we were safe on the other side of the oceans.
You don't think "healthcare laws, educational subsidies, business regulations, and welfare" benefit from economies of scale? You just listed 4 area's of the US system that are massively broken, many as funding and support have been removed in the last 30 years.
From what you've said you seem more in support of a corporatocracy than anarchy.

It needs a lot more than a majority to work.
Any imbalance of power leads to the above. It is, as said a power vacuum.
If you are surrounded by vacuum (other Anarcho-capitalists) that state is maintained. The instant something/one else enters play, the vacuum disappears.

As much as I love bitcoin, Dollars are a more stable currency at the moment and most suppliers / workers aren't going to take bitcoin as payment.
There are good reasons they don't keep their payment in bitcoin, yet anyway.

What you want bitcoin to be a stable and not a rollercoaster of value like the Stock Market?
Careful, you're starting to sound like you would want to use it as currency.

What business model? Its a currency, not an investment or a business. Despite how many people seem to think it is.
Merchants convert to USD because at the moment USD is more stable and their suppliers / workers don't accept bitcoin. They use bitcoin because the transaction fees are much smaller than with anything but straight cash.

Should I drag out the Socrates quote about "The Youth" or get that collection of Times articles they re-write every 5-10 years about how the current generation is self-absorbed spoiled brats?
Every generation has these individuals, and every generation of 20 year olds are mostly focused on themselves and/or changing the world to how they want it to be.
