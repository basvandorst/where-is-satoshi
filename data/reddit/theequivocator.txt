I stand corrected. Thanks.
(FWIW, I knew "Robert-Marie" was not a common name, but I was under the impression that compound names like this could be freely formed from existing names. I guess I was wrong.)

[The original Forbes article]( on this matter includes a quotation from the analyst, John Noecker Jr., that addresses these points at some length:

Who admitted this, and how is that any more than speculation?

~~It's actually a convention used in some French names (think Jean-Marie). [Wikipedia's explanation](
~~&gt;The second part of a compound name may be a given name normally used by the opposite sex. However, the gender of the compound is determined by the first component. ... The feminine component in male compound names is mostly Marie, as in Jean-Marie Le Pen.~~

This is really good speculation! You ought to make it its own post so more people see it.

How is it a loose definition of profit at all? This guy was buying Mt. Gox's debt at a steep discount and will get more than he paid for. That's a profit, clear and simple. He's not one of the people who originally had money in Mt. Gox.

I think the guy you're replying to addressed this when he wrote:


Satoshi's status as originator of Bitcoin gave him enough influence that it might be reasonable to expect that his voice would carry the day in a debate like this. Who knows when he made the decision to step down?

Which point do you consider unreasonable? That Satoshi's influence as the creator might have been enough to sway people to his side of the debate, if he were still the maintainer? That Satoshi might have relied on this when he downplayed the potential problem of future debates over changing the block size? That he didn't at that point foresee stepping down entirely? Or is it something else that you disagree with?

Well, I don't know who's included about "commonly", but I don't think that's the strongest proof. My own spelling is not that consistent between the two. YMMV

Nice article. Lucidly written and pointed out ideas that I hadn't fully considered beforehand. I kept nodding along with the writer, like, "Oh, that makes sense."
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:50:07


Really? His words, which people have linked to in this thread, were "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."
To me that seems to pretty clearly express that Satoshi entertained at least the possibility of "needing" a change like this at some [later] point in Bitcoin's growth. He even touched on the practicalities of making such a change at that later point, suggesting a way it could be introduced with minimal disruption.

Not really. It's like saying "the programming code known as C++": explaining its terms for those who aren't familiar with them.

I don't understand—do these wallet services allow unlimited guesses at the password? Shouldn't some sort of throttling eliminate this sort of attack altogether?

I find it hard to imagine someone programming a bot to do that, when they know that the expected value of their bets is negative.

Wow, good for him. That takes guts. (Or does it? I'm not sure how fluid the Bitcoin market is; I'm just assuming that it's not easy to convert several hundred thousand dollars worth of Bitcoins into cash very readily.)

Are you not an intelligent person?
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:47:47
I believe you—although I still find it hard to imagine.
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:59:28
Ah, OK, I see. Thanks for explaining.

That's how it starts...
