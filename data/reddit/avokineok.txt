Hope you scanned the code already. Someone here will find a way to do it..

Thanks for you reply, but I honestly think not any 5 year old would understand your answer. I 'sort of' understood you. :)

I believe that it does work efficiently, but maybe there is a possibility to solve different problems instead of the random (are they?) calculations done now. But again, I'm kind of a noob on Bitcoin, so please explain to me why this is or is not possible. Thanks.

I'm not saying this should replace the current system. I think it is great, but it seems not all that computing capacity would be needed for just the calculations. Maybe it is, but please explain why it can't serve more than one function as I asked about. Thanks.

Awesome, never heard of that, these types of double functions to me are very important, since the computing power needed will grow and it seems to me not all that power is neccesary to only solve the mining-calculations. Nice to see other coins have been doing this already. Interested to see if Bitcoin might see something similar in the future. Thanks.

Great, thanks for your time.
Before asking this question I was under the impression there was an easy way of just rerouting some computer calculating power to tasks which might serve another purpose, but with your replies I understand why it's not that simple. I really was hoping it was easy though, since the future will make the mining business exponentially explode in calculating capacity which requires an insane amount of electricity and is not very environmentally frently.

Simplified translation:
* all 579 Jumbo-supermarkets get extra security by police
* two times before explosives have been found at earlier threats
* police searching for more clues, asking public to help
* profile of the a possible suspect: male / 20-40 yrs / living in Groningen city

To anyone? Can anyone get the coins when they have access to the email?

Not an introduction. An advertisement..
Also: absolutely ***no*** reason to trust them with your privacy. They only say 'just trust us'..
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:17:29
I hope so, can you give a source?

Not only that, he used a fixed 5$ price, while Radiohead (among others) had a pay-what-you-want pricing, starting at zero.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:07:40
That's what he WOULD have had if he would have bought BTC at the same time his wife bought FB shares..

Great response, thanks!
Two problems/delays I encountered:
1- Yesterday I sent 0.24 BTC via Bitcoin QT to an online account where I wanted to make a purchase for exactly that amount. I didn't use Bitcoin QT for months (if that matters), so I saw at the bottom right corner it needed to 'solve' a lot of 'blocks of transaction history' before being able to send or confirm the amount. This took over 30mins, and about 10.000 'blocks of history' while I have only made 5 small transactions ever, so how does that work?
2- Also, because it took that much time, I wanted to send just 0.0028 extra, since the BTC value changed in the hour it took in total to get process the transaction history and confirm the amount paid. The prices had also changed considerable on this website.
That small amount gave me a popup inside Bit pin QT saying the amount was 'exceeding the limit' (too small I guess?) and therefor needed an extra 0.0001 to let this transaction take place. 
I was ok with it but don't understand the popup, also isn't this also added to all other transactions automatically and in smaller 'fees'? And my fourth and final question is: why did it take more than an hour to get 'any confirmation' on such a small amount and was it only 'confirmed' when I woke up just now and saw 63 confirmations? 
Sorry for the many questions but thanks so much for helping me understand better and use Bitcoin in a better way. I think I get the safety aspect now and learned more already about the actual solving of  (TRANSACTION) blocks, because I always thought it was about random solving of equations without any purpose other than the Bitcoin mining, but now I feel a lot better about Bitcoin isle self actually. Thanks.

Thanks for the elaborate explanation!
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:19:09
Great idea, maybe it can grow out to be a wiki page anyone can edit for speed and a nice overview?
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:37:59
How to change this transaction fee? I'm using Bitcoin-24 EUR and have not seen this transaction fee. Is it a mtgox thing?
@_date: 2013-07-29 16:17:31
These kinds of personal conversation which many people might find interesting are why Reddit is interesting and not just a time-wasting website.
Thanks again
@_date: 2013-07-29 13:30:40
Thanks again. Great to understand it better. 
How do you personally calculate the fee if you want something to be processed faster? Do you just guess when you need it really fast and just take a quick look at the amount of Kb and the amount of BTC? Or do you never change it? Cheers!
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:07:02
Let me try to write down how I understand this (in laymans terms) :
1- Transaction is instant and irreversible
2- Confirmation will make the amount appear on the receivers account
3- confirmation can be achieved faster when you add a higher amount of BTC as a sort of 'checking fee'
Anyone who can tell me what TX stands for?
Anyone sees anything wrong with me understanding?
Any chance someone can explain how to set/change this TX/checking fee?
Thanks a lot guys and girls!
