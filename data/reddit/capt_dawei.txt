Tbh, I think that they just have an amazing PR/marketing team, to surf on the BTC hype.
Cause buying KFC with the actual TX fee....

XBT = BTC
Different codes for the same currency.

They're trying to achieve the 20k dip today.
They're trying to push thought it and break the sound barrier.

There should be corrections at 15k and 20k. Try your chances there.

Well, Bitcoin doubled in price in the last month and gained 20% in the last 24 hours so it's definitely a possibility. 
I believe that anything is possible with cryptos. And 20k would be in the "not crazy" range.

I think you can e-mail the support to manually verify your account. 
Worse case scenario, use another exchange like Bitfinex.

Well, if you keep drowning yourself, 1 year from now you might have the same regret all over again by missing out who knows how many opportunities. 
Also as a general rule, one does not imagine history for a reason: as no one can 100% predict what could have happened. 
With the 90 BTC,
You could have bought a house, a car, married your dream girl (or guy), etc...
You could have become a drug addict, lost everything in casinos, have a fatal accident in your Ferrari, have a heart attack due to the volatility, etc... 
Only "God" knows what could have happened.
Plus, all you can do anyways is to just move on and enjoy life as it is. (Or perhaps invent a time-machine)

You CAN use the fiat currencies you deposit on Coinbase to buy cryptos. 
Btw, what did you mean by "the USD wallet is just a stand alone wallet for making digital purchases???" -&gt; like a Paypal account you can use to buy stuff online? Its definitely not the case.

The chances of that 100$ be worthless overnight or even in some years is quite low, as in really low. 
The chances of that 100$ be worth 100k in a few years is definitively a possibility. 
Seems like a sweet gamble to me.

Coinbase doesn't charge a fee for sending BTC (or whatever) to a wallet, the miners do. 
Coinbase is bad cause they charge high fees when purchasing/selling crypto with fiat money.
