Possession of bitcoin is absolutely legal in China so as trading it privately. So yes, Chinese people are hodling some percentage of bitcoin. The world is much more than US and china, there are British, European, Japanese, Korean, middle east, Canadian, Australian, Russian, indian, Singaporean... What happen if only 1% of these people want to hodl some bitcoin to hedge against inflation?
