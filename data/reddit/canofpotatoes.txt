My personal favorite is Gillette Stadium.

I see, ok.

What do you mean by that? That if I buy different currencies and they fail and i'll just be negative instead of ahead? Just curious.

I bought from coin base because it was very simple then moved it to a mobile wallet, Airbitz. I hear there is a way to pay minimal fees but I haven't looked into it much.

I bought $200 worth when it had just passed $5k and am just going to hold it for awhile. Maybe start buying alt coins as well to see how they do.

I bought $200 at 5k and am happy to just be a part of it. I enjoy the technology and excitement of something new. Sure, the profit is nice, too, but I like following this unknown path (relative to my group of friends).

Well, I just bought $100. I've been researching like crazy and just didn't have the balls but what's $100 for some excitement. I spent more on dinner the last 2 weeks.

Hi, I just bought 100$ worth and plan to keep adding monthly. I've heard about diversifying with ETH and Litecoin. How important is it in the crypto currency area? I'm familiar with other investing and still learning about different currency's.

A great example and movie is The Big Short. Some investors did this with mortgages and made a killing.

It's kind of like people wondering why banks are closed when the average person isn't working but personal accounts are not the reason banks are open, it's mostly business accounts.

I am also pretty new to this, I used coinbase to buy bitcoin then transferred to Airbitz on my android phone. It's new user friendly/simple and i'll probably look into a hardware wallet closer to christmas. Just wanted to give me experience so far.

I see. I've always valued consumer opinions and judging crypto's that way is tough because of how different it is. Thanks for your response.
