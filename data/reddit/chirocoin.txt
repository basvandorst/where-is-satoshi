i did agree with their terms. that's the point. they didn't follow through. they should then extend the "pending" time from 7 to 14 or even 20 days in order to avoid the stress of dealing with our emails. it's just basic business practices.

OMG dude. if you give someone a couple thousand and watch it potentially vanish, im pretty sure you would do the same. Just let it go. Coinbase fixed the problem. It's all good..and they are working on the algorithm. You hopefully won't see angry customers in the future. If you ever run a business like I do you will understand where I am coming from.

Well, my problems got solved in a day because of my bitching.  A business owner like yourself should be used to customers like me who believe that we should get what has been advertised and promised. I am happy for your superior will power to be calm and collect all the time. Good for you.

I hope you realize that you are bitching....about my bitching. For no reason at this point...

I am doing neither. I purchased this a week ago. I am simply wanting a business to act like a business and follow through with its business model. I run a business as well so I know that problems do happen, but communication is also necessary and that is not happening as well as it should. I don't take it lightly when other people have control of my hard earned money.

Seriously? Why are you defending their faults that even THEY are apologizing for? EVERY business has the right to refuse and/or cancel service. That's not the point. The point is that on their main page they advertise being SAFE and SECURE. Well, this policy of canceling last minute on verified, return customers due to a fraud algorithm is not very secure to me.

Sorry to hear that. It seems that until they hire more people to change that awfully coded fraud algorithm the only way to be heard is through this subreddit

If it's not your money on the line you have no idea what it feels like to have this happen to you. We all "preemptively bitch" because we are putting in hard earned money and want it as secure as coinbase advertises. wouldn't you get upset if your money just vanishes and no one responds to you?
