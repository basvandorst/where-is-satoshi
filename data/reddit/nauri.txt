No real reason for alts in general, but for zerocoin, there is true anonymity and no public leger, which a lot of the current bitcoin infrastructure (e.g. colored coins) probably relies upon. Again, wait for someone in to reply to that post and we'll see the possibilities.

See the "counterparty" thing under "More Discussion" in my comment above.

With your analogy, what is Proof of Stake?
Earth minerals : Gold
Machine Time : PoW
Unspent coin : PoB
? : PoS

Not really. See some of my past comments. Zerocoin will be released as an alt. 
Also, follow [this discussion]( to see what kind of financial system could be built upon zerocoin, if any.

That makes sense, and is unfortunate. Thought that this stuff could be part of the whole "distributed everything" dream, but because it relies on preventing full anonymity I've gotta classify it as evil. I wonder if there's anything being built upon zerocoin... hm... according to [this]( bitcoin won't be implementing zerocoin so it'll have to be a whole nother system/coin. Googling "zerocoin colored coin" doesn't give me anything. Thing is, zerocoin isn't even fully written + open yet. The latest: [this discussion]( and the [two]( [papers]( mentioned therein.
Tl;dr: yeah, idk either yet.
Edit: I [asked the question in @_date: 2014-01-11 04:35:13
Check out the stuff under "More discussion" below, on "Counterparty".
Proof of burn looks like it could work for transition between backwards-incompatible 1.0, 2.0 etc versions of a coin. E.g. code in 2.0 says if you send your 1.0coins to address UPDATEXXXXXXXXXXX, with your 2.0address as part of the txn message, then an equivalent number of coins gets sent to your 2.0address (i.e. the blockchain is forwards compatible but not backwards compatible) and all's good.

Do Colored Coins etc. require that bitcoin remain pseudonymous rather than actually anonymous? E.g. is all of this compatible with zerocoin proliferation?
