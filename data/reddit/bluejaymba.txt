I think this would be doable. Perhaps create a massive excel sheet with several look ups seeing where each transaction leads to?

Fairly high, although nothing in life is certain except for 3-Month Treasury Bills of course.

This wallet is empty....

My loans are still active as of 1:25pm eastern time. I'm not sure if the borrowers have forgotten or what. But it's odd because the average daily interest is now at 0.02% (So maybe they're waiting for the BCC to be credited to their account?)
Anyone else still have active loans at these high rates? Wonder if my borrower went on vacation and forgot?

Honest question -
Why on earth would anybody want to use Bitcoin as a form of currency if protocol change is going to be this volatile? It seems as if a migrant worker would just be better off paying the 5% Western Union remittance fee back to his homeland rather than having to worry about which chain is going to succeed. 
I'd rather just buy my drugs on Frayser BLVD with cash instead of constantly having to keep up to date with Bitcoin's latest developments.
Please advise.

That's what I figured. The altcoin split is already baked into the cake. 
If the markets were expecting Bitcoin Cash to truly be huge, I'm sure we'd be seeing 10-15% returns.

Honestly - I fucked up there. Your insight is 100% spot on, I was just happy to get in at those rates.
