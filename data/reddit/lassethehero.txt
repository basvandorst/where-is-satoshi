What are your thoughts on the team and tech behind a coin like ada then? For me that is also a tech with conservative long-term steps
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:59:12
Then why not invest in a coin like ADA? So much potential

I’m not downvoting, I’m reading every comment, and they’re all nice, happy to see a thread with so many constructive answers :)

Can someone explain me what’s meant by “China thinking” about something? Sounds like a poorly written article
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:45:30
So you’re entirely out of the alt market?
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:39:29
Yeah the slow transaction times are also very attractive to invest in
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:06:24
The reason for the dip is simple: old technology, better alt coins will take over
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:46:36
I guess that settles the discussion :) have a nice day! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:45:24
ADA, read up on it
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:40:09
I’m talking about the tech

With the current transaction time and the insane amount of power used per transaction, what is the reason for investing in BTC, with all the alt coins out there with a (supposedly) brighter future?
No hate, just curious 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:54:09
Bitcoin will be knocked off the top by alt coins like ADA, there is no way bitcoin can keep up
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:28:47
What an unnecessary, awkward post, you’re not any better commenting like this
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:56:27
So you’re a fan of the insane long transaction times that uses shitload of electricity?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:42:23
And bitcoin uses a hell lot of electricity
