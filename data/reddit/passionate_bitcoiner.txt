Nice! Congratulations to Coinsecure and the team. Have been following them for a while now and they seem to be pretty good!

Completely understand when you say that it does not help much with living expenses... But I'm hoping the day would come when its a lot more easier to just purchase anything with BTC and help the common mass live our regular lifestyle with bitcoin... That would be simply cool.
For most people, currently would have to exchange their BTC for fiat and then as per the law of land pay taxes accordingly. As far as what and how blockchain would do this... I'm not sure... Maybe someone from blockchain would be able to throw some light on this :)
As far as I'm concerned, we've been receiving payments in BTC from all our client base across borders and it's just so easy and hassle free rather than having to go to banks and wait until the payment is cleared.
Apart from that, for our expenditure, we do sell to individuals/ trading platforms when fiat is required.. and that has worked alright for me so far :)

Well, this is the latest update on their blog:
BTCJam Downtime Update: 
We’d like to update you on what happened. At 8am PST time this morning, one of our disks crashed. As the bitcoin daemon was running on this disk, users temporarily saw 0 balances on their accounts. As soon as we noticed, we took the service offline and are working with our hardware support team to install the new disk and re-sync everything to it’s original state. As it it is a hardware problem, it is taking a bit longer than other types of bugs we can fix faster. We were not hacked, no bitcoins were lost, and all wallets, investments, due payments etc will be back in your account shortly. We are conducting an internal review of our RAID setup to prevent this in the future. We expect to be up and running shortly and we are very sorry for this inconvenience and thank you for being a dear member of BTCJam.
And that was about 10 hours ago! Does anyone else have further updates?

Hopefully that day is not too far of...

It's true you know... coz otherwise Amazon wouldn't have come this far with all the charge backs they would have had by now!

Thanks for pointing that out :)

Don't think any bitcoiner would like that suggestion of yours!! LOL...

Well, maybe that's the case with all wives ;) hahaha....

Check out the video on the link provided... I think it is explained damn well... Maybe that would help clear your doubts... And if you have questions, maybe someone from purse.io should be able to help..

True... Can't understand why governments think that it's just Bitcoiners that help launder money, while the fact remains that there is more fiat which helps launder money! We are a fraction of what the rest can do...

Thanks for that. Your name is pretty interesting! Quite close to Satoshi Nakamoto.
