The problem is basically similar to double spending.. There's no public ledger so people can say "ahh yes, I can see that I'm the only owner of ETF unit  - so even if the ETF is being honest and only issuing units that have backing - there's no way for the end buyer to tell if they actually own one of those units. 
Perhaps all financial products should be changed such that there is a public ledger and on your brokerage statement it could have some anonymized owner number that goes on that public ledger so you can make that connection and detect when you're being defrauded -- but realistically this will not happen because these kinds of frauds are where the financial services industry's profits come from.. they sell off client assets and loan out the proceeds at interest.

The problem isn't so much that the ETF will create more units than they have backing for (although that happens) -- you have brokerages but they often don't hold the assets either but an IOU from a custodian and that custodian might not actually have it either but some sub custodian has it.. any of these people can make "mistakes" (aka fraud) that mean that there is no real asset behind the statement you get from your brokerage that says that you own X units of whatever.
also ETFs make less sense for bitcoins than other assets.. you might want to trade oil without taking possession of it but there's no cost involved in taking possession of your bitcoins.. the main reason people will want to use ETFs is to allow them to perpetrate some sort of fraud.
