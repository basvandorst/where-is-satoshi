Yes it can. It's pretty clear that enforcing that less than N% of transactions are non-segwit with a soft fork is possible given that it's possible for every block to have less than N% non-segwit tx.

I've liked him recently, but a few years back he really didn't understand Bitcoin well and would say things that were complete nonsense, like that in a 51% attack scenario you can just "ignore the attackers blocks". And his book had some plaigerism too which wasn't good.

You just pivoted from the sell off being due a tax benefit because it's 2017, to the sell off being rebalancing irrespective of tax benefits being a smart move. If you want to admit your argument that we should see a sell off at the end of the year for tax reason is wrong, and actually people are just rebalancing, go ahead. Just be clear about it.

The futures contract doesn't need to be on already existing Bitcoin. For a physically delivered Bitcoin future, you only need to have the bitcoins ready when the contract expired. When the future is traded, it doesn't matter whether the Bitcoin exists yet.
All bitcoin futures markets (except ledgerx swaps) are cash settled, so the contract isn't on bitcoins that will ever exist. Rather, it's a bet on the settlement price.

Nope, you fundamentally misunderstand how Bitcoin works. It's a consensus system, we come to agreement on the transactions in the blockchain. However, mempool propagation is not a consensus mechanism. I could have 17 trillion transactions in my mempool and you could have 5. It's all based on the logic and parameters of the software managing our mempool.
Of course you can look at your own mempool and say how many transactions you have. But, posting "there are 19000 transactions in the mempool" is the equivalent to posting "it is currently 75 degrees on Earth" while you sit in your temperature controlled bedroom.
But if you truly believe you can tell me how many unconfirmed transactions there are, I'm willing to make a 25btc bet with you. Simply come visit me, tell me how many unconfirmed transactions there are, and I will show you my mempool and we will see if there are truly that many unconfirmed transactions. I'll even let you take the money if you are off by less than +/-50%

Luke's node is a seed node, so his is more accurate by nature of many clients using his node to find other nodes
Bitnodes just navigates the nodes and finds nodes with open ports. Bitnodes could improve the accuracy of their node by estimating the fractions of nodes with port 8333 open on average and dividing by that.

No, the open interest for Bitcoin futures are insignificant. 6000 on cboe. That is the equivalent of 3 days worth of Bitcoin mined.
And keep in mind that there are 2 sides to each trade. Thats 6000 long bitcoins and 6000 short bitcoins. 
Not to mention that bitmex has had the ability to short Bitcoin for a while now, with their contract having ~60,000 Bitcoins in opern interest. Shorting Bitcoin has been easy for a while now.

Saying the mempool has 900 unconfirmed transactions based on your local client is like saying it's 80 degrees out on Earth right now based on your local thermometer. These posts do nothing but further confuse people about how Bitcoin works and what the mempool is for.
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:33:30
Cool, I sent a transaction in 2011, not one confirmation yet. Looking at unconfirmed transactions volume is useless because there is infinite demand for zero fee transactions. The unconfirmed count only measures the number of transactions which have a fee rate over the arbitrary theshold set by your client and whose form fit other criteria such as script type, lack of dust, etc.

Well, ignoring the fact that ethereum has a shitty blockchain with little incentive to run it, I'm pretty skeptical that a blockchain based exchange would be viable. Firstly, blockchains cannot securely have the lightning fast response of a centralized exchange. Most exchanges can process an order in less than a millisecond if you're colo'd. Secondly, you still need to invoke trust in the company to pay you a dividend, or accept your vote. The trust in this individual is protected by the same legal framework which protects you from malicious brokers and exchanges. In other words, if your trust in the broker is compromised, it's likely your trust in the company recognizing your ownership can be compromised.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:02:44
You rely on a database when you're using a blockchain as well. Not sure what failure mode you're trying to describe, but a database shouldn't crash because the price crashes... and the technological hurdles necessary for a trade-scale centralized database are much lower than that of a decentralized blockchain.
In other words, the only reason you should be using a blockchain is trust reduction, because you aren't getting a "more stable database" when you use a blockchain.

Yes, your math is absolutely wrong. Please don't spread misinformation, and do some research before making assertions so confidently. The attack success probability is not hashshare^numblocks, the formula is in the freaking whitepaper, read it please. The success probability is ~21% each time they attempt, given 33% hashshare.
Not to mention that miners can do other nasty stuff with 33%, like Finney attacks (any large %), selfish mining (25%+), and more.

Your mempool is not the same as everyone else's.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:26:44
Indeed it does. It varies based on the nodes mempool logic. Because of this, a more accurate analogy would be someone checking the thermostat in their climate controlled office and saying "the temperature on Earth is 75 Fahrenheit".
Some nodes very well could have 20,000 transactions which other nodes reject 19,100 of.
In fact, if your client accepted 0 fee transactions you would have tens of thousands of transactions in your mempool. If the reference client allowed 1/10th the fee, the mempool wouldn't be "clogged" even though it would have many more transactions. If the reference client required 10x the fee, the mempool wouldn't be "empty" because a majority of the transaction in """"the"""" mempool wouldn't be there, but they would still have unmet demand for recording.
Mempool being empty isn't indicative of anything other than the default feerate being too high for all lower fee transactions not being able to be propagated. It's a completely useless statistic.

Yep, and the count is the size of your mempool, not the number of unconfirmed transactions.


No, I meant to say exactly what I said, and you're wrong to say I'm incorrect. This is very simple: unconfirmed transactions are data, you don't have all the data, I can generate an arbitrarily large number of transactions locally which you will never know about, therefore you cannot determine how many unconfirmed transactions there are.
If you really think that you should define the unconfirmed transaction count that way, then why don't you start a new client and make a post saying there are 0 unconfirmed transactions? Wait, I already addressed the relativity and therefore uselessness of this metric and I'm repeating myself because you're not listening.


The size of the mempool isn't the number of unconfirmed transactions, way to strawman your way out of a corner. Then dash a few red herrings in there. There you go!


I think you're being insincere because you failed to acknowledge any of the reasoning I gave you. I hate to go to the appeal to authority, but look, I've been working with Bitcoin, reviewing code, writing code, following the research and talking to researchers and developers for probably twice as long as youve known about Bitcoin. These are just facts I'm laying out to you that we have known for years, and youre ignoring them and it's frustrating.
