Can't you just send crypto purchased on an exchange straight to your wallet? Is this brokerage more like a local BTC thing where you have buyers and sellers exchange face to face? Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick. I honestly want to know how a BTC brokerage works.

Yeah, I mean, do you just tell people to buy Bitcoin all day? What else is there? Do you sell ledgers?

Not sure this question is applicable.

Thanks for posting this! I've been mining and in the BTC scene since 2011 and have seen tips on reddit but never bothered reading up on it. Now I don't have an excuse not to learn more!

Yes, he works on OR now, but he did not found OR. He created the FPS genre with Doom then made Quake to follow it up. He is a programming genius and happens to now work on OR.

Ugh. Bitfunder.  They just kicked most of their users out and crashed their economy.  My bonds went from 20 BTC to 5 overnight because they told all Americans to gtfo.

Any idea when this service will go live?

How will that help? It's still a crypto currency. Are you going to allow Americans for a little while then devalue all of their assets by not allowing them to trade those assets anymore?
