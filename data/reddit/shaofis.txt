Based on the fact that they shipped once I started the charge back; it was clear that my CC company contacted them in some shape acting as the catalyst to their shipping. 
Given that I assumed they would challenge the charge back with proof of delivery. I reversed the charge back as a result.
*edit* That is of course after I unboxed the unit and verified it worked correctly.

My order date was 5/10/13. I hesitated on posting anything; BFL has had more than their share of drama. 
I had just been introduced into bitcoin and started mining with my graphics cards. Found a link to a site selling an ASIC; that site at the time didn't really indicate that they were so far behind. I just saw estimates that the system should ship in around 2 months. 
Of course I had since learned exactly how far behind they were; but based on the August/September timelines I gave them until just recently and attempted to get a refund.
I called Paypal first and they would not help me; in fact they instructed me to initiate a charge back with my CC company. I did just that in within a week I had my system.

It is true; unfortunately. If you are unable to find anyone please let me know. I'll work with you offline as best I can. I accepted the shipment and as such I do have a certain relationship with BFL that I'd like to not jeopardize in the event of hardware failure.

Just initiate a charge back on your credit card; they will ship in days... At least that is what happened to me. Mine arrived yesterday.

I went through the same process. Didn't get a response; got tired of waiting and so I initiated a charge back. I received notification and a day or so later the unit arrived.
It's hashing away as advertised.
Just more salt in the wounds of those still in line; they are holding inventory; not shipping as built.
