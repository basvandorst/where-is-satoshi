Do you think Twitter will make money in the future?

The implementation is backed by math. The value isn't, which is an important distinction to make.

How liquid? When the crash happened, how much we're you able to sell?
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:56:21


Yes, and your argument clear. It's not however well-reasoned. 


No, it means you have more potential and more resilience. Let me break it down for you. 
* There are multiple ways to invest your money
* Since we cannot predict the future, it is impossible to predict which investment will give the highest return. 
* Higher volatility means higher potential returns and also higher potential losses.
* More volatile investments tend to be more liquid.
* If we split our assets between multiple investment targets, we have multiple investments at varying volatility.
* Investing in more than one target means that the odds of one investment taking off are higher, but the profit is also lower.
* Investing in more than one target also means that the potential losses are lower should any one investment tank. 
* If the goal is stable long-term profit, diversification is a better choice. 
If your goals are short-term and you are willing to shoulder the risk, then you don't need to diversify. For every other case, diversification is a damn good idea. 


So did you react to the crash last week? No? I guess that settles that then. Your reaction is not as fast as you think it is, since you ate a 50% loss that you rationalize by taking the long-term view. That's fine, but don't kid yourself about your so-called reaction time. 


Yes, but this is not a bad thing!
Diversification means you limit your losses (as well as your profits, as you correctly surmise). If you allow a slightly clumsy poker analogy, diversification is like playing multi-table limit hold'em as opposed to playing single table no-limit. If you multi-table online poker you already know the value of diversification intuitively.

There are way more rebellions than revolutions. The difference being is that a revolution is a rebellion that prevailed.

What happens when the highest value asset ceases to be the highest value asset?
This is why diversification is a good idea.

Sell high, buy low. If it was truly liquid, you could have sold and bought more bitcoins after the crash.

If you are in a position where losing all your savings is an acceptable loss, you are privileged whether you want to admit it or not. 


There is no error here. 


You assume that you can react quicker than it takes for a boom/bust to occur. This is empirically not true, so your conclusion is erroneous. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 08:47:04


You must be tremendously privileged to be able to afford this outlook. 


The point is that you don't *know* what your best asset is. Like you said, you can't see into the future. This is another reason why hedging your bets via diversification is a good idea. You not only protect against risk, but you also have your finger in more pies. You don't truly know what your best asset is, so it makes sense to be involved in several.

This is a very poor example. 
A better example is making a choice between 1/3 chance of 3x return, 1/4 chance of 4x return and 1/5 chance of 5x return. 
All bets are seemingly identical in EV. Diversifying in this case reduces variance.

Starcraft 2 is a PC real-time strategy game that's rather popular. People play it a lot online, and there's also a vibrant tournament scene. So far during the last few years, several millions of dollaras have been given out in tournament prizes.
In addition to tournaments, you also get the occasional showmatch. This match is one of them. The match is between the two biggest non-korean (koreans dominate starcraft) names, and it's sort of a grudge match. There's been no shortage of trash talk leading up to the event. 
The winner will get 10 BTC, the loser walks away with 2.

Cryptocurrency is inevitable. Bitcoin becoming the de facto cryptocurrency of choice on the other hand is not.

They are not, and you yourself illustrate the difference: 


If you played perfectly, you could have sold when the crash started and gotten back in after the crash. Holding was incorrect in the short term. Unless of course you are now willing to concede that short-term and long-term are different? 


This is exactly it, I'm glad we can arrive a consensus here. 
Not diversifying is the optimal strategy if and only if you bet on the correct horse. However, since we have no way of knowing which horse is correct, diversifying is a way to manage that risk. 
Consider this: there are N investment opportunities. Of these, there is one that for any given time-frame will give the highest return. This means that there are N-1 opportunities that will have sub-optimal performance. The odds of you making the best choice is very low. However, if you hedge your bets, you are more likely to have +EV outcome overall since any one investment tanking won't sink your total performance. 
You get to choose what level of risk vs potential return is acceptable to you. I'm merely saying that you are taking a needlessly large risk by having all your eggs in one basket, and I would recommend against it. You get to make your own decisions.

There is no disagreement here, I fully agree with you. I can't rightly comprehend why you think I can't do basic math. 
This just has no bearing on whether or not it's "correct" to invest everything into bitcoin. The only thing you can say for sure is that investing everything into bitcoin is a highly volatile strategy. Diversification reduces volatility.


Right, and the best decision is to take the uncertainty into account and guard against it my diversifying. You are less likely to win big and you are also less likely to lose big.

Right, but the topic was diversification, was it not? In particular, it's not sound to have all of your capital bound to any one particular tradeable commodity. It exposes you to a severe completely avoidable risk. 
If you have a more diverse portfolio, your earning potential is slightly less, but you reduce your risk exposure dramatically.
@_date: 2013-05-17 11:26:59


Exactly.
