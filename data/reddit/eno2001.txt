That was AWESOME.  Thank you.  That's all I needed was someone to point me to something simple and easy to understand.  It raises so many questions of legitimacy, but it's an interesting idea.  I'm surprised no governments have shut it down or imprisoned people over it.  A decentralized currency makes no sense in the real world, but... it's an interesting idea.  The mining thing has me stumped.  It sounds more like just making something out of nothing, but there has to be some real productive activity behind it.

Ahhh... I normally ignore the side bars since they're generally useless link pasta.  This one seems to be a useful basic explanation, but I did ignore it until you pointed it out.

Hehehe... thanks.  I can see what you mean.  Fortunately a few folks have actually been helpful instead of acting like fan boys.

ELI: What makes this guy NOT the executive director of Bitcoin.  This is just another Paypal, right?  Only with better encryption than SSL or something?

Money and government are inherently connected.  Since there is no governmental control, the currency should be invalid for some purposes (and it sounds like it is).  Only businesses that have chosen to accept it are using it and most of those are "geek" centric.  Which is OK, but I can't see this ever becoming a sanctioned global currency to buy anything and everything.  Until we have some sort of world government, that likely can't happen.

OK.  That answers my previous question about the value of mining.  So you're both a consumer and an employee in the system.

Hmmm... I believe I've been trolled.  Well played.

You can assume troll... but I'm seriously trying to get an understanding of what I see as a bizarre and sort of "off brand" approach to money.  I can't give it any real serious consideration until there is a government controlling it.  Like the rest of the valid currencies in the world.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:01:55
OK... so I was right, eventually governments would have to step in to control or ban this approach to currency.  I still think a decentralized currency will always be relegated to left field unless a world government is established.  You need some kind of central controlling body that prevents the currency from being used inappropriately (say to purchase products and services that are illegal) by force of retaliatory violence (ie. prison).
Being completely new to this, I am still looking for the positive side of a decentralized and unregulated currency if it is to be used to by more than a handful of things from businesses idealistic enough to honor bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying bitcoin is a bad thing, but to think that it will replace real money is a bit naive.  The best outcome might be the transitioning of the world's existing currencies to digital currencies the emulate some of bitcoin's benefits.  Maybe the transition of the U.S. Dollar or the Euro to an eCredit?  Building on the ideas that bitcoin has pioneered, but adding to them the ability for governments to track their citizens to prevent crime.  That would be an ideal outcome because at some point citizens need to be controlled up to a point.

In case you can't tell, I'm not kidding.  I've heard a lot of people talking about Bitcoin, but I have no idea what it is other than some kind of fake money that geeks use online.  I assume it's just another way of exchanging real money online, like Paypal.  No reason to downvote me.  Just provide me with some basic explanation as to how the business owners behind this sytem couldn't have an executive director.
