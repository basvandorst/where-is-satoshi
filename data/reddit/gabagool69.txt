I have some bad news for you.. converting all your assets into BTC doesn’t free you from the grip of the IRS.


Which, again, is backed by the military. Say China were to call all its debt today. How do you see this playing out? Why do you think we have the credit to build up infinite debt without China forcing us to pay it off? That’s not to say we can default, as that would collapse faith in the USD and tank our economic system. But when push comes to shove, our financial credit comes from our military supremacy.

It's backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which is backed by the most powerful military on earth. You can redeem your freedom by giving the US government some of your dollars in exchange for the right to earn those dollars in America. If you forego paying the US government some of your dollars out of your earned dollars, you can redeem guns coming to your door and placing you in a cell.

Not quite, the value is still set by the market. The USD being backed by gold says nothing about the value of gold, only that the fiat is pegged against the scarcity of another asset. In the case of crypto, that asset is computing power/electricity.

First, the federal reserve sets monetary policy, not the US government. Second, the federal reserve doesn’t set the price of anything.
