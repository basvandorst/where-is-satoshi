@_date: 2015-06-01 20:48:10
okay gutsy balls guy, this isn't a game of fortitude.. you need EVERYONE IN for bitcoin to succeed, tough guy. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:06:18

yeah so in order for bitcoin to be successful the "weak hands" have to get out... makes no sense, this isn't a game of texas hold'em.

or 
 (ideally running electrum personal server)
this combo will allow you to build transactions, export and sign them offline using PSBT.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:23:47
first one is: 88.043 sat/B
second one is: 182.43 sat/B
just really surprised it has been so long since sent with still no confirmation on either, thought SW was supposed to improve conf times.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:55:50
oh no one was ever needlessly snide on reddit you're the first.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:40:51
cool thx
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:42:42
btw, these were sent from sw addresses in trezor, not sure if that makes a diff.

@_date: 2018-07-15 23:12:17
HUGE bitcoin supporter? you're not paying attention. Besides, in this day and age, with all that we have at our fingertips; we don't need "thought leaders" or gurus anymore. They only serve their own narcissistic purposes and create echo chambers of lemming followers. Be a honey badger :: Lead your own thoughts. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:44:26
I don't hate any of these guys, as a matter of fact I rather like Naval. I just don't like the SV/VC desperately money grubbing power hungry culture (that bitcoin is designed to smash.) 
Robber Barons are so late 1800s.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:41:26
so just for clarity's sake (and since you're now the self-appointment r/Bitcoin police), where in the following top post on r/Bitcoin does it mention bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:45:29
so do it smart guy... I just don't understand your point of pointing out lame points that don't matter in the long scheme of really any point.

Take a look above your slowly sinking comment, there is a valid discussion going on that does pertain to Bitcoin.
