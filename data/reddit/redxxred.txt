Good work! But I suppose 99% of the user doesn't know the transaction bytes-size...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:45
No, it's not listed in their fee page... They change the fee dynamically during the day, but all withdrawals are processed once a day.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:36:10
That's not the point...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:42:18
Yes, sometime there is a small margin between minimum and requested... Sometime... :-(
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:54:13
No, sorry... 
In the past there was the possibility to set the fee. Now they almost force you to pay that fee, regardless of the withdrawal size (0,1 BTC or 1000 BTC is the same).
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:05:48
Their fee isn't proportional to the transaction size. No difference between 0.01 BTC and 10 BTC withdraw.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:46:36
Sorry, maybe I badly expressed the concept. I mean, you (BitMEX) can disincentive the outflow of BTC by setting the withdrawal fee... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:37:00
Totally agree!

I withdrew from Binance a week ago paying 0,0005 BTC and the first confirmation came in less than 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:56:26
"withdrawals WAS large 3-of-4 P2SH multisignature transactions" two days ago too ...  but the withdrwal fee was nearly 20 USD ...

Past week I withdrew from Binance paying 0.0005 BTC fee and the first confirmation came in less than 10 minutes...
It's pretty clear that BitMEX uses that fee to manage the cash flow ...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:19:02
What a non sense! BTC miners are profiting from that supposed spamming. Higher fees are so good for BTC miners
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:18:38
It would be very useful! ;-)

Withdrawals for foreign customers will resume almost certainly ... Not so sure for the chines customers...
I withdrew everything one week before the ban! :-D

I spend 1 day uploading tons of photos of my driver license card and they refused them ... I spent another day uploading tons of photo of my National ID card and they refused them ... When I succeed in uploading a clear photo they said me: "please upload your passport photos instead of your ID card" ...
BTCC GFY !!!!!!!
Guys, don't do business with them!
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:22:32
My national ID card is a national ID card, but it seems that, on your part, a national ID card is not a national ID card...
Bye bye BTCC

BTC in China is officialy dead: 
- no leverage/margin trading
- no "zero fee" trading
- no purchase of good in BTC
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:57:43
I mean, traders like me, cannot withdraw because stuck with open positions in alt currencies. Closing those positions would have been too costly...
Others traders were unwilling to pay 20-30usd fee to withdraw few hundreds usd worth of BTC...
Others traders were on vacation...
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:07:31
Anyway... it was the only major exchange unable to face this alleged problem... 
They own 150000 BCH. So they just need a 0.1% fee to cash in 150 BCH = 150000 usd, if my calculation are right... 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:45:20
Sell BCHX17 then...
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:52:34
Great work! U are a genius!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:58:17
A lot more money????
Some crappy exchange have done this in a couple of days...
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:38:49
You don’t know what you are talking about... You don’t know BitMEX... You don’t know why some traders were unable to withdraw...
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:42:13
Those that sold at $300- have been bamboozled
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:12:29
So, McAffee will eat his own dick...
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:54:27
Exactly, price is going down because some big players decided to trigger the mental stop loss of the btc-lovers.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:45:28
LOOOL ! stop it! my jaw is aching! :-D
