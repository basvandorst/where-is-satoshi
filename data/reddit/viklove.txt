You really like pointing arrows at things, huh?

But they're so ugly and cheesy... They devalue your brand.

I spent $3.30 on the humble indie bundle and I'm already back up to $10... pretty nifty.

And his point is that Wells Fargo is a known criminal, yet millions do business with them.

Yep, exact same address.

Peter Thiel is a bit of a moron, though.

Where do you think they get the money to give out the loans?

Honestly, what OP did was rather childish. But I guess that's this sub in a nutshell.

You can't even generate a rainbow table, because it would take too long.

lol I bought in at $700. I'm not even worried. The trick is to only invest as much money as you're free to lose.

I would tend to argue with your second claim. Especially when it came to copyrights, Jobs clearly didn't value innovation over money, and at the end of the day he was just an idea man. I don't want to get into a lengthy argument on Reddit over whether or not Jobs was a good person, but I would like to let you know that I understand the point your making, but still disagree with you.
p.s. I didn't downvote you

You can tell that physicists choose their words very carefully. He wasn't wrong at all, he was just stating what he had observed. Also Steve Jobs is a terrible example to use because he's an awful person who lied to a lot of people to make money.
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:33:21
You may be right, but he clearly didn't agree with their work (I doubt he didn't know of its existence). He spoke his mind, but still allowed himself enough room to be disproved. All of the other quotes OP posted are remarkably final statements, and I think Einstein's stands out because of this.
@_date: 2015-10-22 05:06:54
Well, I think you would agree with me, but it depends on your other moral convictions. Do you believe in the concept of land ownership? That people or groups of people can take control of land, then control and maintain it with the use of force?
If so, the discussion stops here. A group of people took control of land, literally put in words how it should be governed and how the line of succession should work, then signed those words. These individuals were by-and-large supported by their constituents, and later elected by them.
If you don't believe in land ownership... I'm not sure this one is possible since I'm pretty sure you live in the West and you're not a Native American.
Also, they're not forcing you to do anything. You are free to leave, or even change how it works through peaceful means. Isn't this the best way to do things?
@_date: 2015-10-22 05:30:21
They don't "take" it. You entered into a contract by becoming a US Citizen (or wherever you're from), or living in a country, whereby you provide money, and the government provides services. You can void the contract by renouncing your citizenship and leaving the country. No one is forcing you to do anything, citizen.

They receive a portion of everyone's labor because we established the government to supply us with safety, infrastructure, stability, et cetera. What are you on about?
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:37:46
If you take something like the concept of government and reduce it to a single issue, then reduce that issue to a single question, and ask strangers on the street to answer that question, then yes -- the government is the most terribad thing ever created. If you actually look at the concept of government *in context*, take the time to figure out what gives them the power and right (philosophically) to rule, and evaluate what they actually do, it's not hard to understand why its a phenomenally fantastic thing to have.
Schools? Firefighters? Police officers? A stable monetary system, infrastructure development, space exploration (the list goes on...) would all never have existed without some form of government. If you disagree with the government, feel free to find a stretch of land somewhere in Africa -- I'm sure no one will "steal your labor," and you'll be able to live happily. There isn't a stable population anywhere in the world that operates without government, but I'm sure you'll succeed.
I think it's time to unsub from this subreddit; it's starting to look like 13-year-old me's Facebook feed.
edit: oh, and by the way -- "we" is nearly all of humanity, throughout the past several millenia.
@_date: 2015-10-22 05:12:01
So you're saying the government provides no services? How are you even connected to the internet right now?
@_date: 2015-10-08 20:38:25
Not really, it was literally designed to be an arms race.

You can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that things like this don't grow linearly. I'll just give up trying to explain it to you.

Wow. As someone who has really wanted to buy bitcoins for a few months now, I wish I could do it that easily. Why does it have to be such a headache.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:59:19
How do you link your bitcoin wallet to your reddit account to get this to work?

The guys you described in your scenario aren't very smart.

Percentage growth makes way more sense than flat growth. Simple concepts like logarithms might confuse you, but that doesn't mean you can ignore them...
