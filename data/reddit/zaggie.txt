I'll wager that if a stock he was holding plummeted because executives dumped millions of shares ahead of the news of a huge quarterly earnings miss he would have a very different story. Or get elected to Congress where insider trading is legal.

Corporations should get prison terms. And during their prison term they should be unable to interact with customers or other businesses. Imagine if JP Morgan had to close for a month because of a fraud conviction.

I would also be concerned that he is funding the company from crypto gains instead of operating cash.

Or he is Bitcoin rich and cash poor. 
It is better to pay a 15% premium than miss payroll.
I'm not saying that is the case, but I am always very suspicious when an employer offers anything other than a company check for payment of their salary. It's a lesson hard learned.

In many cases, I wouldn't disagree.

I assume you work in a Bitcoin related industry, so here is my concern. You are doubling your exposure. If something happens to Bitcoin it could also impact your company. You want to diversify your risk not concentrate it.
Bitcoin is a speculative investment at this point. You shouldn't have any more invested in it than you can afford to lose.

Long VOO and some individual stocks when I feel inspired.

I don't think you are actually calculating risk. You are describing a feeling you have, not managing risk. 
Also, I don't think your understanding of diminishing marginal utility is correct.
But you made your 30% and you are happy with that. Good on you.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:50:03
You do you. 
I've been in VOO since 2011. I don't have any complaints. 
I'm not an economist, but if you can show me a better return with less risk for a long-term, unmanaged investment, I'm open to hearing about it.
"Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin... The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, "Well, maybe I should skip a year or something." Just keep buying... American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well." - Warren Buffett

Why close a long position on a steadily appreciating asset just because you hit a predetermined arbitrary return?
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:25:33
There is some really bad advice in that. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:09:42
Why not sell six so your initial investment is covered and keep anywhere from 2-4 in Bitcoin to continue to participate in the current run? And then maybe sell off more if the yield flattens?

I'm no crypto expert, but a Bitcoin ETF would allow investors that are unable or uncomfortable with direct ownership of Bitcoin to participate. Also, it would be a security, so it would be required to meet a variety of legal and market requirements in order to be traded. An investor wouldn't have to worry about their wallet being lost or hacked. Plus, easier tracking for tax reporting. Also, some investment vehicles might be barred from investing in anything but pubclicly traded assets.
