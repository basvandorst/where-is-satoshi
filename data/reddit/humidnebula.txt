Yeah, friends can be a full spectrum experience. I've had friends that match my interests exactly, but just make really bad calls. And friends that I disagree with on most things, but are really stand-up people.

Man, thousands of years of smoking weed and we can't make one that doesn't make you look line you're sucking a dick. Not even for thousands of dollars. It's like it's subliminally in the heads of every glassblower, every pipe smith, to sick dick. 
Take the bubbler for example. Bongs do everything bubblers do, but better. But it's like someone looked at the pipe and thought "Hey, this cock is missing some bollocks to cup as I work the tip, that would be just grand"

So do I need a separate one for each one of my coins?

Can you use bitcoin, *easily*, without a smartphone?

Truer words never spoken.

One of my favorites. The setting is just perfect.

I always wonder what it was like to be on that one drug he took while he was starting at the table. It sounds kinda ambiguous.
@_date: 2016-06-13 07:30:43
C'mon guys, this is funny.

It's fiesta time finance

I wasn't sure, either. I drew some correlations after thinking a bit, but there wasn't a bolt of understanding.  
@_date: 2013-02-27 05:02:23
I like you because you give more than one solution.

Must have been one hell of a meal.

That was just the movie. In the book, [Make Room! Make Room!]( soylent was a soy-based steak patty.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:39:31
See, it was never really about drugs.
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:18:26
Thanks, man! Honestly, this is my first bit of BTC. I'll keep spreading the love.
@_date: 2013-08-15 01:27:58
Nope. You get the coke. Get those spiders working overtime.
@_date: 2013-09-18 07:29:47
It would be nothing but mod posts.
@_date: 2013-09-21 23:49:17
The truth of this depresses me.

Out of curiosity, how big was that tip from Edit: spelling

Expect a briefcase of Dust Off cans on your doorstep in the morning.

It would be like betting on who mines the next block.

It's because it's dried. Makes it slightly less comfortable for bacteria.
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:37:24
Thank you! I guess it was 20 BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:40:00
Thank you! I remember those days when Bitcoin was $200 a pop. The Rockefeller Era.
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:52:13
Kinda missed the point, dude.

This is the fairest answer. Realistic but not damning.

Cool Beans.

Great cause, love the news about Bitcoin support. But I don't think it's very Indie. All the same, going to support HB.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:58:17
Maybe they already have...
@_date: 2013-08-14 19:46:38
That was a bit sensationalist. But that's news for you.
@_date: 2013-08-07 16:22:40
Yup, just like the boy's name Adolph.
