The return could be anywhere in the range of +♾ or -40.00 roughly. Welcome to the fair, hope you like roller coasters!

40 bucks is absolutely worth your time. I have about 300 in myself. I’d try to sink some more into it if you can afford it though.
40 bucks of bitcoin won’t grow so big you can retire, but hey it might be worth a few grand in a couple of years. Could buy you some nice toys or be a good nest egg fund.
Either way no one can 100% predict what will happen to bitcoin. So invest what you can afford to lose, and maybe something big will happen. That’s half the fun of it. Just remember, when there’s a possibility of big gains, there’s a high chance of big losses. Be prepared for either one.

There’s three possibilities:
1. Bitcoin becomes the global currency replacing all fiat. You’ll be glad you traded your fiat for bitcoin so early! 
2. Bitcoin remains a secondary currency and increases in value by 10,000% in 10 years. At 1,000 invested you’d have 100,000 in fiat. Not a bad gain!
3. Bitcoin fades into the shadows and becomes forgotten and worthless. You lost your money but at least you invested what you could afford!
I view bitcoin as another investment. I diversify my savings between stocks and mutual funds. I also put a little in crypto (although that’s more of my fun money). You don’t want 100% of your eggs in one basket, so make sure you have other investments going on (it sounds like you do though)

Coinbase is a decent app to buy bitcoin with. They do charge a fee though. After I think two weeks you can transfer the bitcoin to your wallet. 
Crypto is complicated. I don’t even understand most of it lol.

You’ve damn near doubled your money. Not bad at all. Those weed stocks will also pay of in a few years for sure.
What do you use to invest?

One thing to note about robinhood with crypto is that you own “shares” of crypto, but the bitcoin you have on there is not yours. It can’t be transferred or spent. Not a big deal if you plan to exchange that for fiat in the future, but if you actually want to own and spend bitcoin it might be worth looking into other resources.
I use robinhood too! It’s not a bad tool, especially for a novice that’s dipping their toes in the water. Good calls on all the stocks you bought, stable and established companies that will for sure grow in the future. 
Keep up what you’re doing, you’ll be thanking yourself in 20 years (with the stocks and bitcoin)

Some do. I know brick and mortar pays something like .026%. 
I believe ally pays like 2.5%.
But that’s why I hold a small amount in actual savings. The rest stays in mutual funds.

This is why banks give you interest.
But that’s the main difference between the dollar and the bitcoin I’m terms of investment. If you want to make some $$$, buy bitcoin and forget about it for 10 years.
Do that with dollar bills and the opposite happens.

I’m waiting too. Do you have Robinhood? I’m putting my money in robinhood while I wait, and once my money is verified im going to transfer the money over to buy physical bitcoin. That way I’m still technically getting in at the current price
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:58:26
I checked for myself, clicked the question mark by the buy price and it explained that the selling price and buying price were different.
But again I say, time stamps or nothing happened.
If it is true, big big big.
I stopped buying on robinhood though. Don’t have much use for the app now
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:10:38
Man I was talking to a guy about bitcoin and opened up robinhood to show him the price and damn near had a heart attack when it was at like 11,900. Last I saw it was pushing 14,000 10 minutes earlier.
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:04:50
Tf! Bitcoins sells price for me is 11,775 and the buy price is 11,835! I feel ripped off!
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:52:43
Bitcoin updates every second on robinhood. Would like to see this with the time and date in both photos
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:16:14
I never had an issue with robinhood either, although I mostly used it to buy stock. I switched to Coinbase recently as well. It seems pretty reliable.
Although I transferred 35 dollars into it and bought some bitcoin, and it’s saying that I bought $35 In bitcoin and still have $35 available to spend in my account. Not sure if it’s just being slow or it doubled my order. I’ll find out when it debits tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:24:58
I should. I was talking all kinds of shit about how the price was rising and I had made a little bit of cash and told him he should invest a little.
Then I opened the app and saw my 40 dollar profits sitting at 20 lmao
Still gonna invest more on payday

Been struggling to get over 12.5 all night. Been watching it fluctuate for hours
