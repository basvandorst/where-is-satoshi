as I understand it, one of their propositions is that the value of BTC will rise over time. I assume the $5 is at current BTC exchange rate?

Thanks. Once I import to multibit downloaded program, does that mean my bitcoins are no longer stored on blockchain.info and instead are only stored in an offline wallet (offline wallet = mutltibit). Or are they still stored on Blockchain.info? Or am I confusing all this stuff. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:13:04
thx. I changed it back to Blockchain for the time being until I can figure out a better method.
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:34:48
Can the same process be done with Coinbase? ie import private keys held at Coinbase into Multibit app?
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:40:24
Details? Context?
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:12:29
I may have saved it in the past - don't recall though. I have a 'aes.json' file saved on my computer in a 'blockchain' folder...???
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:27:57
Thanks. Just d/led Multibit. Syncing is at 16% right now.

facebook reviews speak for themselves.
my last cloudhashing contract payment was 12/21. suspicious. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:17:04
thx. Have you noticed a long delay from when Cloud Hashing shows payment sent and Coinbase showing payment received? My time gap has been a few hours now. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:35:08
Yes it is verified...
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:19:54
well GLAD i had two factor auth enabled and email/sms notifications enabled! didn't do a damn thing to protect me. 
false security. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:35:45
yes, tunein has an android and iphone app. 
and 
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:02:03
So yes, excellent point for why miners would continue to mine. But how does that incentive translate to individuals who are already holding Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:05:02
i've never once rec'd an email from Blockchain.info....
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:46:40
Love it. Suggestion: move the DONE button down the screen closer to the keyboard. It will allow for quicker one-hand entry. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:17:54
man, going all in! awesome. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:35:27
Can you confirm exactly which info I need to record?
One area in my wallet settings on Blockchain.info shows "Export Encrypted: Below are your private keys AES encrypted." and it has a ridiculously long number listed (704 characters). Is that what I need to keep and use if I needed to restore my bitcoins elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:05:38
thx.

Khan Academy has some vids on BTC
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:58:06
Yeah not a good sign!
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:24:03
because Coinbase (I assume) doesn't want to get caught up in any bitcoin hacking scandals. They want those folks to take their money else where. 
I agree, though, that Coinbase should be explicitly clear on how they intend to use the credit report information.

Person to person alternatives with zero cost: PayPal, Venmo, SquareCash. 
Micropayment and across border transactions are the only strong stand outs. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:48:39
i get that. but because Paypal, Venmo, and SquareCash are fee-free person to person services, Bitcoin isn't really a superior solution for this yet - if wide-spread adoption is the goal. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:17:53
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:30:50
Ha, I didn't mean to suggest at all that they would shut down. But just occurred to me that IF they do, I should probably have some of my info written down somewhere....

**EDIt** The number listed is 704 characters long.

A credit report check has many more uses than just to extend credit in the for form of credit cards or money - many large businesses run credit checks as part of the hiring process to validate the address and employment history - in short to make sure you are an honest person (with what you said on your application). 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:02:07
agreed. seems illegal to me. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:52:30
Thx. What do you mean by "...you deleted the text from the original post!"
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:21:55
you must be new to bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:58:21
very odd!!! here's the url. takes me to the original post. You should not be getting any sort of 'removed' message.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:27:59
:) I posted link to original reddit post.
