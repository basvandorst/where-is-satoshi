Then by those definitions, not even USD is a currency as it does not hold its value. USD is merely a medium of exchange.
And I use BTC as currency. I compare value in BTC (unit of account), I use it as a store of value and a meduim of exchange. You can tell people its not a currency all you want but it is used as a currency by many, and used not as a currency by many others.

I think they just removed those now too. lol
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:54:36
BTC exists and its used as currency. Therefore it is a currency. The arguement should then technically be about whether it is a good currency or not.

He confuses state communism with all communism and state capitalist (such as corporatism) with all capitalism. Bitcoin is more anarcho capitalist and anarcho communist than capitalism or communism alone.

You are wrong Bookman117.
1. Bitcoins can be broken up so there would be zero need to produce more to facilitate more transactions.
2. People and businesses will both accept and use it. Why? Because businesses can get away from bank domination. Now people can transfer money around the world and it only costs the use of electricity, instead of hundreds in bank transfer fees. This makes the current bank model obsolete.
The only issue here is that this market has only existed for a few years. Its full use and value have yet to be found.

I'd love to have two bitcoin sub reddits.
One "for the fun" and the one "for the serious".
And then they are better organized. When I was some fun, I open one, when I want the nitty gritty, I grab the other.
Or perhaps one that is simply bitcoin (like now) and the other that is bitcoinmarkets, or something to that effect.

No. Not a bad idea. A key part of money is to be a store of value. Inflation removes this function.
The reason you have incentive to spend the money is because you want stuff. Deflation allows for people to wait and buy which helps in preventing over-consumption, which of course is a major problem in the western world, especially in the US.
Plus deflation, in history, has been one of the main ways people get out from being poor. 
Inflation is like cake. Its a lie. Its just Keynesian propaganda. That's why crypto-currencies with inflation built in are being abandoned, like Feathercoin. Look at the markets like btc-e.com, you'll see they are worth pennies cause no one wants inflation.

I've attempted to. I have yet to find a means of submitting a question to their site. Its been very frustrating.

Fantastic article. Great use of logic and pointing out possible logical fallacies occurring.

Minimum wage in the 60s was $1.25. In today's currency value, that's around $25 bucks. Real wages have only gone down since the 60s. The reason? Idiots think a minimum wage should be stagnant and not connected to inflation.

"And for a customer, a credit card offers insurance and fraudulent seller protection (ie if I don't sell what I promised, the credit card company won't pay me and refunds the money to the customer). Why would a consumer want to give up these protections?"
The transaction is in the public ledger. So everyone could see that s/he's bitcoins were sent to you. Then there are other tactics that can be taken, such as filing complaints and liens for services not rendered.
The upside is that this is cheaper and can be more secure than a bank.
Course you can check out what this lady did to combat services not rendered...

If he wishes to do so, great. However he could lose most of that $200/month. I want to make sure he has the option to avoid losing money.
Also the price above $200 per bitcoin hasn't even been so for a month. The current price could just be a short-lived bubble. We could stablize at $250 or $550. So to bring in recent trends (your edit) has no applicable bearing.
But I agree, for his sake I hope he decides to hold onto some.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:34:38
lol Thanks.
I forgot to put above that I'd accept (and prefer) being paid in bitcoin anyways. :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:55:11
So I'm a bit confused. Downloaded the browser, created an account. Now what?
How do I send you my account number to receive the bitcoin?
**edited to add**
Or rather, is coinbase able to send bitcoins by just using your email? 
I have a coinbase account but I haven't used it at all yet. I was distracted by another exchange. So clarification on this would be great.
***edited to add***
I guess it does work by email as I have received my 7 cents worth of bitcoin! Thank you!

This man doesn't seem the type to trust his own wallet and software. Plus I doubt he would want it for the volatility. Plus he needs to pay for his own supplies regularly.
I will talk to him about asking his supplier about bitcoin and keeping their eyes open for other suppliers that will. That way he could just use the bitcoins rather quickly.
I have a "saving/investment" in bitcoin. He had asked me about if I held onto bitcoin and I think as he gets to know it more, that he'll do the same. Baby steps for the US. :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:02:21
Anyone have any idea what this bubble will peak at?
Anyone know any signs that should be looked for, that would show the downtrend is a real downtrend?
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:29:51
I think the opening of the new Chinese exchange brought with it a healthy growth in the market and brought the value up around $200. (sustained increase in demand)
Then healthy growth gained the attention of news organizations who updated everyone on some very cool bitcoin news such as: The first bitcoin atm in Canada and a wallstreet insider officially endorsing bitcoin for future investment. (temporary, unsustained increase in demand)
So basically, these types of articles have helped to fuel a bubble on top of the healthy growth.
Personally, I think the current price should be between $200 and $300 and the rest is all a temporary increase in demand and speculation.

Will an ipad browswer be able to fully use the bitpay or coinbase sites?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:59:10
Or maybe it means people want a currency without inflation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:49:35
Definitely wait.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:33:56
More details please?

Inflation is a lie.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:56:03
That would be really great. I am quite cautious with things, so I'm not sure how we'd do this. Should I PM you is there another method of communication preferred?
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:30:42
They know bitcoin (technology) makes their business plan obsolete. Just drives more people to wanting bitcoin imo. :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:45:03
So if he goes to bitpay.com with his ipad's web browser, he can use it to generate a QR code for the customer to scan? The ipad's web browser can fully utilize bitpay?

"The reasons banks suck is because they operate on a heads-I-win-tails-taxpayers-lose basis when it comes to trading in exotic financial instruments, not because they charge fees. Also, this is why paypal and credit unions exist."
So instead of sending my friend (who lives one town over) money same day with bitcoins, I need to spend an extra dollars to do it through a service like paypal, credit unions or transfer companies like Western Union? You are so right, I hate saving money and so does everyone else in the world. /s
I'm sorry but you aren't thinking what you are saying through. A business competes and if they can save a few dollars by not having to rent a credit card unit or pay transaction fees, they will.
Businesses also want more money. So instead of passing those savings onto you, they may keep it for themselves (at least until other companies do the same and competition resumes).
"What happens when 1*10-8 bitcoins is worth $1000?"
Then they use it for large sums and probably use another crypto-currency, like Litecoin, to do smaller things. This is why people refer to bitcoin as the crypto gold and litecoin as the crypto silver.
I don't mean to demean but you don't understand the technology behind bitcoin and litecoin.

So true

Actually, I think they are going to print their yuan into non-existence in the long term. Then replace it with a gold-backed currency. This would explain their massive gold and gold mine purchases around the world, over the last several years.

Is there a link this on youtube or anything?
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:29:29
True. I may start doing that once I help this guy setup his and get some experience with rates and procedures.

This is to help a local food truck guy. I told him about bitcoin after he complained about his credit/debit service. He's interested but I don't want to cost him any money.
I wouldn't want to tell this guy that in order to use bitcoin for your business, you either need to buy another tablet cause the one you have banned it...
Or, sorry but you'll have to break your contract with Apple and jailbreak your device. Especially when this guy barely gets the technology.
I also don't want an attempt at using bitcoin to cost him money. Even if he gets a few bitcoin users, that wouldn't cover the cost of buying a new tablet. So setting him up with bitcoin needs to not cost him anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:52:06
I meant signals and ideas used in other markets.
I mean I told friends that the new exchange in china caused a natural growth that caught the attention of news who helped create a bubble. I was even saying I think it'll go to 500 or 550.
I was also thinking it will go back down between 200 and 300. Now its over 600 and I'm trying to figure out where the natural growth ends and the bubble begins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:09:20
Awesome! Thank you. :)

I don't think you know what you are talking about.
Meanwhile, I need to send a friend 100 miles away a thousand bucks, some day transfer. What's my cheapest method... oh yeah, bitcoin. Even if bitcoin was going for 100,000 dollars per bitcoin, I'd just buy the appropriate fraction and send.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:54:19
Tip: Stop buying and selling all at once. Buy and sell in smaller amounts like .x or even .0x so you aren't putting all your eggs in one basket/price.

Thank you. That is the sort of thing I was looking for. :)

This article is a perfect example of what is wrong with journalism today. The guy is writing about something that he obviously doesn't understand. I do not mean he that he doesn't understand because he isn't supporting bitcoin but because of lines like this...
"There are only 12 million bitcoins, and there's supposedly a programmed limit to how many will be created."
Supposedly. Yeah, why doesn't the writer fact check? Course the way he puts it is also a manipulation tactic, IMO. It makes others who know what bitcoin is, even less than the author, feel scared and pre-judge it.
When are people going to learn that if you disagree with something, you should know what it is! Know what you disagree with!!! Gah, stupid "journalists". 
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:40:55
I think the way I say it leads it to feel more natural. Plus the "yet" gives across the idea that they are behind the times. But I'll keep it in mind and try it out, see how it feels. :)

I don't know why I get downvotes for sharing. I thought it was cool even though I don't actually expect to get any donations whatsoever.
As for the site itself, its for the comics I make.
If you were ever a fan of the game City of Heroes, these are superhero comic books I make using that old game program. They are all on that site. I'm working on issue 12 now. They're a labor of love.
