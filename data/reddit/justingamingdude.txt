It’s very interesting man ever though about putting a few longs for like 10-50 dollars at 200 dollars? And then ride the wave back up
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:46:33

My point is it’s completely sad that a government is unable to properly create currency platform, for users and it unable to have such huge flaws
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:43:09
