This is something that the majority of the country is unaware of and one of the biggest threats to freedom and liberty that exists.
The police have the ability to SIEZE anything of value that you own under unjustified civil asset forfeiture laws that derive from aspects of the Patriot Act ... you know, to fight terrorism...
In a nutshell, your property is considered guilty until proven innocent, the police can sieze said property and then it is up to you to PROVE in court that you are not a terrorist and/or that your property is not being used for illegal actitivities.
Meanwhile, while the police and government are holding your property they are legally allowed by law to borrow against it...  So basically, they are incentivized to do this because they get to use the money as if the money is theirs.  It is absolutely criminal...
So, this means that if you ever have any large amount of money on you, especially gold, they can just sieze it.  It is 100% legal to have large amounts of money on you, it is 100% legal to have a car full of gold if you like.  But that doesn't matter, that doesn't affect civil forfeiture... they will take it, and use it.  Police actually refer to this as free money...
and it takes about a year and $5k - $10k in legal fees in court to get your money back.
NOTE:  All of the above can and does take place without any charges ever being levied against you.  That's right.  you are never arrested for anything nor are you under suspicion of having committed a crime.  They just literally take your money and then you have to prove you are not a criminal despite the fact they are NOT charging you with anything...

NO.  When I read the white paper I IMMEDIATELY thought "This is the goddamn future of money".  
A few days after I read the whitepaper and went on a quick youtube bitcoin explanation video binge, I believed that bitcoin had a 10% - 15% chance to become the currency of the future outright... and a 50% chance to become the  currency of the future as a close 3rd behind fiat and credit cards within the next 20 years.  
Shortly after this period back in 2016 I bought some bitcoin, then I cashed out Dec 2017 and bought back in Nov/Dec 2018 when bitcoin was in the $3ks, I cashed out again when it hit $13k and bought back in at $10k and I will keep cashing out after each time Bitcoin goes insanely vertical and the no-nothings jump on TV and suck bitcoin's dick... then buy back in after the correction and a plateau.  
rinse and repeat all the way till bitcoin hits $100k which I believe will be in the next 5-7 years

It feels like more and more countries are going to adopt Bitcoin which further legitimizes bitcoin...  
When people in huts in Africa know more about bitcoin than the general populace in Industrialized nations, makes me think bitcoin has a shit ton more head room to grow.  
I did a quick "survey" of 20 people at the poker table in a casino over the course of a few hours of play... Several professionals, a policeman, a teacher, some business owners, etc and only 1 guy (an IT guy) owned any bitcoin.  About 70% of the table had a vague idea about bitcoin having heard about it on the news but the didn't know what all the fuss was about...   One guy had some "Crypto" and was proud of it, but it was a shitcoin I'd never heard of and he didn't know anything about bitcoin and that all crypto was more or less the same so he figured he'd buy the cheapest one...
So yeah, feels like bitcoin has an EASY 10x growth left in the next couple of years without even breaking a sweat.
The time to worry about bitcoin not having more room to grow is when the idiots around you know about bitcoin... And even then, bitcoin just slows down and becomes more like gold...  Imho, we have an easy 5 more years of insane growth, so much headroom.  Feels like the equivalent of planting a weed in the middle of a pristine field of flowers...  so much room to grow and dominate...  they will never see it coming...  Hell, we are screaming about it and still the sheeple can't see it coming...

I had a friend who was a sex worker and she needed me to place an ad for her on Backpage.  This was in September 2016.  Backpage ads were $5 in bitcoin.  I had just fell into $500 and I had been hearing about all this bitcoin stuff.  I thought bitcoin was stupid, I mean, fake digital money not backed by any government?  Then I went to youtube and watched a "what is bitcoin" video and my brain literally fucking exploded.  It was unreal, this was actually something that could soar to the fucking moon.  So, I bought $500 in bitcoin, placed her $5 ad for her.  
Then I had some life drama happened a few days after I bought and I literally 100% forgot about the bitcoin I bought.   
Fast forward to December 2017 and bitcoin is all in the news.  I then remember "fuck, I have some bitcoin" and I log into the site and BOOM!!!!  My $500 in bitcoin grew the fuck up.  
I cashed it out when Bitcoin hit $18k
Then, in November of 2017 I convinced my boss to add a Bitcoin Option for our online sales.  We then did $1600 in sales in a couple of weeks.  During this time, bitcoin dropped in value and our $1600 became $1400 and my boss freaked the fuck out and told me to sell.  I told him to hold that Bitcoin would go back up, but nope, he was adament, he didn't want to "gamble" anymore.  So, I told him I'd buy the bitcoin from him for $0.95 cents on the dollar and he agreed-- this was in November of last year.  
Then BOOM, the $13k high hits.  I cashed out my $1400 and I'm Hodling the rest :-)  So I'm on a Bitcoin freeroll right now...

I can't wait to short the shit out of Libracoin...
I predict it will open and initially shoot to the moon, Facebook and the Government and the media will try to prop it up... but it will fall flat because it is more or less just a corporate form of Fiat that is sucking the Government's dick...  The fact that you need "permission" to use it will be a huge turn off when someone's account gets siezed for not following whatever "Terms and Conditions" they need to subscribe to just to use the coins.  I guarantee you when you open your LIbra account there's going to be pages of fine print about the terms and conditions...  
I do predict that the sheeple will initially like the concept of Libra, but it will become quickly apparent that Libra is NOT bitcoin...
So yeah, I'm basically going to take 50% of all my net worth, and short the fuck out of Libra

The PRIMARY purpose of Law and Justice is not fairness, fairness is a nice-to-have benefit when it is convenient.
No,  the primary purpose of Law and Justice is Order-- an ordered society, a society that does not oppose those in power.
Ross, unfortunately, took a direct action against the State and the State can never let that stand without making an example of him.  The purpose of the life sentence isn't for Ross, it's purpose is to help keep the sheeple in line.
Truth is, our freedoms and liberties are an illusion that the State lets us maintain as long as it does not get in the way of the State running things.  You attempt to disrupt the State's sovereignty or power in any way and the State will smite thee with the fury of an angry Old Testament God

Having worked for a giant corporation, I can't stress enough how dangerous they are.  It's not so much that they are evil, they aren't... it's just that they just don't fucking care about anything but themselves.  If it were legal, they'd sell baby organs to make a buck.  They are pathological in their pursuit of their own interests and next quarter's stock price.  
Regardless if the sheeple figure this out or not, Bitcoin will present a superioir alternative to corporate and government money...
The only cavaet is that bitcoin has to be strong enough to survive sustained attacks from both entities and it appears so because there are factions within both entities that do benefit from Bitcoin.  Foriegn governments are adopting it, and there are plenty of businesses that benefit from it as well.  To be clear, no where near the majority but "enough" to help in bitcoin's defense...

Yes, libtards hate America, they hate this country and they conspire on a daily basis on how to kill babies and help Al Qeada.  They have no morals or any logical basis for any of their arguments.  Their stupid mambie pambie so-called "rights" endanger us all.  The way they whine whenever a school full of children get shot by someone with an assault rifle makes me want to smack em and tell them to "man up."  It's just shameful really, if they'd let us just arm all the teachers and the bus drivers and hell even the other kids in the school those shootings would never happen.  Anyways, you can't reason with libtards.  They won't be happy until the country is a smoking ruin.  If only things could be the way they were in back in the golden age, aka the 1940s, when the coloreds knew their place, and women were barefoot, pregnant in the kitchen where they belong and you didn't have all those pesky gay rights shoved down your throats with their whining and asking for equal treatment under the law.

The irony about Americans complaining about the Iranian government is that it was America who was responsible for deposing Iran's DEMOCRATIC government back in the 1950s and that most Americans are completely clueless of that fact.
And these same Americans have no idea why Iran hates us so much... and for good fucking reason...
Obama had the right approach to Iran, but the Warhawks in America (mostly Neo conservatives and alt Right types) are hell bent on painting Iran as evil because we need an enemy, the war machine needs to be fed a constant diet of wars and conflicts at least one per ten years...  And Iran is next up on the menu...

I have friends that work in the Sex Industry and Bitcoin is essential to their way of life.  The more you value freedom and liberty, the more appealing Bitcoin is to you.
Government and corporate intrusion into everyday life is so ubiquitous that people don't even realize it is happening.  The ability to use your money however the fuck you want without Big Brother's approval or the IRS crawling up your ass for every single fucking nickel or "imagined" nickel is HUGE.  
Right now, most people don't mind because the government and corporate isn't up their asses about things.  However, that is changing.  And one day the Government and Corporate will be up the public's ass with a flashlight, pick axe and shovel digging through your personal life, scrutinizing your every financial decision, and when that day comes, WE will thank our lucky fucking stars Bitcoin exists...

It is my honest belief facebook Libra is going to fall like a dead duck shot out of the sky.

So it will fail for all the reasons why Bitcoin will succeed...

Otherwise, I hate to say it, but all it is is a chain...

I grew up Baptist, when I was younger and well into my 20s I believed exactly what you are saying...
Then, I started questioning everything, all my preconcieved notions about everything and I became more of a libertarian.  In my 30s I became self employed and was a business consultant.  I'd post ads on CL for everything business related.  I charged $75/hr.
a few years into doing this I had two escorts contact me wanting me to help them.  I met with them and they changed my mind about what escorting is.  I researched escorting etc and I had them each making six figures a year doing escorting on their own (i had them ditch their pimps).
Is there a shady underbelly to prostitution?  Absolutely.  But there is with everything.  When I worked for a big corporate firm you wouldn't believe how much carnage we did bankrupting businesses and destroying mom and pop shops just so our stock price would raise $1 next quarter...
There are plenty of sane people with great personalities and dispositions that do escorting work and they genuinely love what they do.  They like sex, they like helping people, they are selective in picking their clients, in short, it is not what you and Hollywood would have you believe it is.  Not to say, the dark side doesn't exist, sure it does.  All I'm saying is it isn't what you think and there are great positive aspects of it.  
I realize I'm not going to change your mind.  For every positive anecdote I write I'm sure you can counter with a negative one.  
All I will say, is once I thought as you thought, then after seeing it first hand and researching it, my mind and perspective were changed.

I would argue it depends on what you want bitcoin to do.
Back in 2013 I had a business where one of my clients tried to pay me for my services using a bank-to-bank wire-- sending me $10k.  The first wire failed, the second wire failed, we were both on the phone talking to both of our banks on a teleconference trying to figure out why he couldn't send me the money... it took 4 tries and 7 business days and it was a stupid trivial problem like one of his accounts having his middle initial and another one not so it sent up  some flag...
I wish I had bitcoin then, the whole thing would have been done in 10 minutes...
I was online surfing the web and I came across a site for playing roulette live... I tried to purchase some money on the site but because I'm in the US nope, can't do it.  Then I notice they have a bitcoin option, I zap them $100 in bitcoin, and 4 minutes later I'm playing...
Last point I would make is that the market place is littered with non-optimal products that dominate.  Take Coca Cola.  Coke is a good drink but it is not the best.  Pepsi repeatedly beats Coke in a taste test.  However, Coke is still the market leader.  Think on that.  Apple computers are better than PCs but PCs dominate the market not Apples.  
Truth is, for the consumer, "good enough" and first to market will almost always beat out "best" and late to market.

That is something you don't have to worry about with Bitcoin, no corporate tool watching over you're every transaction.  .. Also, Paypal customer service is slow as molasses in December.

There is a shitcoin out there trading for pennies that in the next 10 years will be trading for $100s if not $1000s representing an ROI greater than 10,000% if not 100,000%....  
SO it is not a bad idea to roll the dice on some shitcoins.  Take $1k, buy $50 worth of 20 shitcoins, and if you pick the right one, you'd be looking at banking $50k to $5M...   and if you pick all losers, than meh, you'll probably cash out near $400 or so dollars...  
now, if that $1k represents a significant percentage of your portfolio then probably not a good idea.  But if you can splice of $1k and not really give a shit about it as compared to your other investments, then it isn't a bad idea to throw some darts at a shitcoin board and even better if you can do some analysis and ignore the obvious garbage shitcoins...

I've never been one to buy while something is surging up if I'm not already on board... I always like to buy when things are either low and/or plateaued and there is obvious upside. Take XRP.  I bought a few hundred of that at $0.32 just because why the fuck not and I plan on HODLing the shit out of that coin.  If it tanks, I'm probably not going to lose more than 25% of the value I put into it and it's only a few hundred dollars.  But if it does something crazy a few years from now and shoots to the moon at $200 then I would have made a riduculous amount of money for buying when it was peanuts...

Not sure how you got that.  We have a business.  About 30% of our  our total business is online sales.

Bitcoin may not lead to the things you talk about, but boy if it isn't a vital component required to lead to the things you are talking about.
The problem is that the world is run by people and paradigms that grew up in the 19th and 20th centuries.  We are experiencing severe growing pains evolving from 20th century's Industrial Age socio-economic model to   the 21st century's "Information Age".  
THe powers that be know full well on how to rule the Industrial Age, however they are clueless on how to rule in the Information Age.

I think mathematically, if you set a stringent enough initial conditions and boundary conditions, then you should be able to be profitable doing this. 
What I mean is, you wait for serious porno boner level vertical rise and then you know a correction is coming so you then sell the second that boner goes south...  Then the correction is probably going to be 10% or more so you set a limit of where you buy back in, lets say 10% is the line and then you ride the rollercoaster down past 10% and keep riding until the "first" uptick happens then you buy back in...  Sure, maybe you don't hit the top top or the bottom bottom but as long as you are selling high(er) and buying Low(er) it should make you good money...
again, I'm still a noob and probably when I put some serious study into this it very well may be that what I'm currently thinking is not possible...
in any event, I will be careful.  My goal would be to have a good enough understanding of all of this in 3 to 4 months.  Gotta hit the books hard to even remotely do what I'm thinking of doing.  FWIW I do have a math/science background...  Laser physics :)

I do have some modeling experience with complex physical systems, so I'm kinda curious how well that would translate to the financial world.  I will be focusing almost exclusively on extreme events.  I seriously doubt my model will be able to correlate every rise and fall... but I think (hope) I will be able to find correlations of extreme events.
Another interesting factor would be how quickly I can put in a buy/sell order based on what my model says.  My understanding is that with some exchanges it is near instant???
What would be awesome is if I figured out some correlations, wrote some code that would trade for me, then just sit back and let it do all the work...  that is definitely a pie in the sky dream... would be awesome though...

I'm new to investing like this but I think bitcoin may be a very predictable volatile stock.  Basically, just wait until it goes vertical, cash out a small portion, then wait for the next dip, buy back in...  
I've gotten ridiculously lucky with my timing of selling.  I bought in a few hundred Sept 2016 completely forgot about it, then bitcoin all of a sudden was in the mainstream news in Dec 2017, I checked my bitcoin and was like HOLY FUCKING SHIT BATMAN and I sold at 95% of it at $18k then thought nothing of it...
Then at work in 2018 I got my boss to add a Bitcoin option to our website in Nov and we made $1400 in bitcoin when bitcoin was at $4k, bitcoin then dipped to $3k and my boss busts into my office and says, "We lost 10% of our value in just one week, WTF?  Cash us out before we lose all of it!!!"  I tried to get him to hold but he was like, "Cash us out!!!" So then I said, "Fine, I'll buy your bitcoin at 95cents on the dollar which is better than you'd get with conversion fees."  He was like fine.  So I bought it.
Fast forward 7 months and then this happened
I sold some of my bitcoin when it hit $13k.  My logic was probably idiot logic.  I noticed the same thing that happened in December 2017 was happening now.  All of the mainstream media jumped on Bitcoin's dick.  Everybody on TV was talking about it and I just remember this thing about always doing the opposite.  So, because the lame know-nothing media was on Bitcoi0'sn dick and everyone is  talking about the 17 yr high, etc, I figured, meh, I'm gonna cash out the $1400 I bought in at in November...
After reading your post, what I need to do is analyze the charts and stats etc for both circumstances including knowing all those fancy terms analysts fling around... then recognize when the event happens again.
So, next time Bitcoin just goes vertical crazy I'm going to day-trade it, I'm going to cash it the fuck out at the high then buy back in again at the dip.  But i need to wait for the "right" highs and then figure out how to set the right lows.  Maybe only do it for serious verticals that not only go vertical but they go vertical for X period of time in correlation with other financial stats that indicate it is overbought and a correction is coming.  in any event, Your post helped me think about this in a different light. I have to stop getting lucky and I have to learn to put thought behind all of this...

@_date: 2019-06-28 15:06:31
I don't think I'd use a mean reversion algorithm, I think I would focus on creating statistical tools based on rates of change, MFI, and trading volumes.  
I would try to develop models based on several key bitcoin events as a test and then employ them to other parts of the bitcoin curve to see if my model holds up...
truth be told, I'm not sure there will be a strong enough correlation.  I know that bigger brained math types have tried to develop math tools to predict the market and for the most part there is only so much you can predict if anything at all.  but fuck it, I'll try to do it as well and see what I come up with...

hmmm... so you feel a maid working for some uber rich person would be paid at such a low level that they would fit your definition of poor, that is, not making enough money to eat...
I don't think you know how much maids make... 
I think we'd also have to define what is "lower middle class"
I would consider someone making minimum wage and working 40 hours a week to be lower middle class... they'd be very near the dividing line between "top tier lower class to lower middle class"
and those people have the means to save money over time if they live super frugally...  and a decent percentage of them do...

I may not know the financial sector but I do know a fair amount about businesses and industries in general.  There is a sort of "inertia" and groupthink that settles in.  The powers that be are oftentimes  old crusty motherfuckers who are biologically incapable of changing with the times.  
So meh, the argument that "if the banks wanted to do something they'd have done it already" is not a good defacto argument. That is not how opportunity and displacement and disruption works.  What happens is "someone" comes up with a new better way of doing something and the market flows to that new better way like hot air rushing through the open window of an air-conditioned house...  Then all the old crusty types either rush to catch up or they die by the wayside.
The fact that I have to argue this on a bitcoin forum seems a bit ironic to me...

What i thought might happen is that some other cryptocurrency that was tied to the hip to BTC would facilitate lightning fast transactions in way smaller doses.  
Not sure if that is feasible, but I just envisioned that being the natural order of things

Sorry, I should have said $4k-ish to $3k-ish, dropping from $4.1k to something like $3.7k-ish...
As to answer your question, This will sound racist, but it's not.  My boss is Jewish and he watches every fucking cent... and to be fair, it is a good business practice to be mindful of every fucking cent and to not have the attitude "meh, it's only a small percentage of the business why should I care?"
Because those small percentages that you don't care about add up and right fast too.  0.5% here, a 1/10th of a percent there 1/20th of a percent here, 1% there and before you know it, your total business is down 7% and you are wondering why and how...

This argument is disingenuous.  The nutrients in meat are about 8 to 30 times more potent and more effective then the so-called equivalent nutrients in vegetables, specifically protein and doubly so when you are growing.  Not only is there way more protein in meat per gram than vegetables, but the human body processes the protein in meat way more efficiently than that in vegetables.
In order to get the same protein as a 1-lb steak, you have to eat 8 lbs of Kale or 9 lbs of Broccoli...  So it is disingenuous to argue as if you can get the same nutrients from vegetables as you can from meat.  You can't.  Unless you plan on eating 15 lbs worth of vegetables every day which brings with it it's own health concerns not to mention is untenable long term...

Somewhat true, as a child, adolescent, and young adult, you 100% really have to eat meat, to not do so is actually just not healthy.  
Once in your mid 30s, yes, you can and should significantly reduce your meat intake, especially red meat...  but you still shouldn't outright eliminate it altogether...  I'd say probably reduce by 60% - 75%

We are merchants and I got my boss to add a bitcoin feature when bitcoin was at 4k.  We got $1400 in revenue from bitcoin when bitcoin dropped to 3k-something.  My boss comes to me in a panic and says, "We lost over 10% of our value in just one week...  I tried to reassure him and said, "we need to hold."  But he was like, "No, cash out now!!!  And no more bitcoins for us" so, I told him I'd buy it from him for 95 cents on the dollar which was better than he'd get after conversion fees, etc.  He says deal...
Then today, he got something on his facebook about this bitcoin thing and says, "Hey, isn't that what I sold to you in December..."  I said, yep.  He then literally says, "Oh my god" just like the above gif...

it's an elitist attitude that seeks to project and bask in perceived superiority...  
Those of means have a long history of looking down their noses at those without means.  They seek to portray the poor as weak, stupid, etc so that they can make the argument that the poor "deserve" to be poor.  Conversely, by the opposite argument, those with means "deserve" to be rich because they are smart, hard working, righteous...
Nevermind if you are a trustfund baby born with a Silver Spoon up your ass and had every opportunity given to you on a golden platter... You deserve it because you are "better" than the poor people who do not deserve it as evident and confirmed by their circumstances...

There are a small percentage of poor people that have amazing  money management skills.  They save the meager money they make, they buy their shit in cash and are debt free, they save up to make major purchases because they don't have good credit due to low income or working primarily cash jobs and don't report income.  They live below their means, and squirrel away $5k, $10k, even $20k.  And this goes double for immigrant families from Africa, Asia, India... it is really amazing what a poor family working together can save and accomplish.
I know, we like to shit all over the poor for being "stupid" but truth is, you'd be amazed by some of them...

I'm probably just a lucky idiot...
I knew absolutely nothing about Bitcoin, nothing at all... From 2015 to 2016 I noticed bitcoin had seemed to plateau for a couple of years.  Everybody that knew anything about stocks and markets was telling me how stupid bitcoin was.  I had 2 friends who worked in different brokerages and investment firms and I was hanging out with them at a party in Sept 2016.  I told them that bitcoin seemed to have plateaued and that I was going to dump $500 into bitcoin just because why the fuck not.  I had my other serious money in other things, so why not take $500 that I really don't give a shit about (Vegas money) and buy bitcoin and see what happens.  
Everyone kept telling me how big an idiot I was yada yada yada...  Time passes, I literally 100% forget about it, I don't even remember the password to my account, I have it squirreled away in a special place in my home office.  Then, come December 2017 the news media is going crazy about how bitcoin is doing.  I jump online and take a look at my "stupid" $500 and Holy mother of god, that $500 I didn't give a shit about grew the fuck up!!!.   I cashed out 95% of it when it was at $18k
So meh, I'm probably a lucky idiot, but I don't mind using Vegas money for these sorts of things.  The way I see it, it's like using the change you find in the folds of your couch to buy lotto scratchers... If you lose, meh, big deal, you didn't care about the money anyway, but if you win something, holy mother of god :-)  something outta nothing...

what i'm saying is that he would literally launch 15 feet at a 45 degree angle so in that case, no those extra mattresses wouldn't do a damn thing
incidentally, the mattress at the end is required to dampen his last jump... basically he gets so high that you need a "dampener"

The crazy thing that most watching this video don't realize, is that not only does the kid have to be on point, but his "friends" need to be  close to exact in how they step/jump on the trampoline to launch him.  If one side miss times it, the trampoline will depress at an angle and it will fucking launch him right the fuck out of that area...  
They actually have no idea how close they came to death...
this could have went south in so many different ways...

I met a millionaire bum once in the 90s, he lived in Southern CA.  He would hold up these "wisdom signs", each sign had some pithy message like "Be kind to each other... Family and friends before Money...  Little Lies Add Up..."
in any event, he was $10M liquid, had a mansion, family, etc and just choose to live under a bridge holding up these signs.  Think he did this for a couple of years then went back to his mansion... very strange...  He was full bore homeless too, no money on him, nothing.  Until one day he decided he had enough of it.  (Only reason I know about all this was a Newspaper did an article on him and I was like "Holy shit, I talked to that guy last year!")

I will be the first to admit that I know fuck all about XRP.  Before buying some, I literally only spent 5 minutes reading about how it will be some sort of training platform enabling international banks and firms to wire money faster to each other.
That was enough for me to say "fuck it, here is some money, lets see what happens".  
In its current configuration will it do anything earth shattering?  Probably not.  But what I'm "hoping" for is that it becomes an integral part of how financial institutions transfer money to one another.  From what I read as well as experienced... transfering money overseas via a bank is like pulling fucking teeth.  Takes DAYS and heaven help you if anything fucking goes wrong.  Geezus Christ on a cracker.  You have one tiny error and the entire fucking transfer is sent back to you and you have to do it again.  
So, what would happen to XRP if it became an integral part of how all financial institutions send money across borders?  What would happen to its value if instead of it taking fucking days to send money it happened in hours if not minutes?  
What if some calamity befalls current methodology of sending money and the methods that utilize XRP are immune?  What would that do to the value of XRP???
And so, for me, a few hundred dollars to "hope" for the above is fine...  And if 10 years goes by and nothign comes of it, meh, whatever

It's so weird when people do that shit.
I once did a Vegas trip with some friends and I won $20k playing roulette, got on this ridiculous heater.  I got back to work and the word got out that I won $20k...  Everyone's congratulating me and this one guy says, "Well, you have to pay taxes on it!!!" and he said it as if winning the $20k was a bad thing because now I had to pay taxes on it.
I could never understand that logic because after the taxes are paid, you're still up tons of money...

I have a few hundred in various "penny" coins that are either plateaued or bottomed out now... 
reason being, there is little chance of them going bust, so at worst I'll lose 25% or so of value, more than anything I'll probably just gain a percent or two...
however, one or two of those fuckers are going to do something crazy and shoot to the moon at $50 or even a few hundred dollars per coin...
So I bought some XRP and I'll literally completely just forget I even have it.  Then 5 or 10 years from now, if/when it makes the news, I'll be like "holy shit, I bought $400 when it was only $0.32... fuck yeah!!!!

if you were talking about a stock that for 10 years never lost more than 3% of it's value in one week, then you'd be right to scream "the sky is falling"
