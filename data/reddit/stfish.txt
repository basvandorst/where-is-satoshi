I completely agree with you that there are systems that breed corruption, but that is a side effect of concentrating power in the hands of few people (and yes, I believe that bitcoin and other peer to peer solutions can work in order to make some governance obsolete) but I was arguing against the idea that taxation is theft, claim that we agree is false.
My argument is that some things can't be solved by peer to peer solutions (for example police and justice, the authority to use force) without other big problems arising, but a lot of problems can be solved like bitcoin solving finance.

Did you reply after only reading the first sentence of my comment? I made the point that you can relate wealth to intelligence by replying to a comment that said that relating wealth with intelligence is dubious at best.
I also think it applies to millionaires in a lesser degree, but there are also factors we need to analyze in that case: for example a lot of millionaires are old and don't understand cutting edge tech. They are still intelligent but illiterate regarding tech.

I agree that choosing where part of your tax money should go would be nice(for me at least, since I have a lot of free time, but it could be an inconvenience for busy people) but it doesn't solve the inherent problem. You can think of it as halving the tax rate and forcing people to use the tax cut for a government founded charity, and it isn't a good solution at 50% for the same reason it wouldn't be a good solution at 100%.
I believe that a idealistic solution would be a mechanism to determine exactly how much tax money should be taken from people and where it should go, but the only way to do that (at least to me) seems to be some sort of artificial intelligence combined with complete surveillance. Regarding privacy concerns, the survailence should go directly to the AI with no intermediary, otherwise society would degrade into pure authoritarianism.
That solution being in the far future, I think that the system we have in place can and should only take minor tweaks to improve performance for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:37:09
The idea is that the average person doesn't know how money should be allocated to serve the citizens of a country in the most efficient way.
 That's why the allocation of tax money to different departments and projects is outsourced to elected government officials. If you have another, proven to be better, way of spending tax money, or of replacing taxes I'd like to hear it, but I think that every person choosing where their tax money goes to would defeat the point of taxes, because other people benefiting from your tax money will in turn benefit you (more education and better healthcare means a population with able mind and body, etc.) and I think that people are too selfish to understand that helping each other is a better solution than electing to use your  tax money only for yourself.
 You might say that people are more kind and will help each other without being forced to do so, as that has been shown to work on smaller scales (families, small villages or towns, on a lesser degree small cities), but when you get to the scale of a country it gets harder to feel sympathetic to people you see yourself having no relation to, especially when the country is culturally  and racially diverse.
With regards to all this you might say that small local governments should have more power, but we have to agree that some projects require a bigger government authority to undergo them (for the same reasons stated above about cooperation between people in big groups).

@_date: 2019-07-31 15:30:42
Also, I agree with you that blockchain can bring more transparency to government spending and that can be a good thing, but by "a better way of spending tax money" I mean a better system i.e. not elected officials choosing where the money goes.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:19:36
Well in general it's a pretty consistent correlation. Higher education does cost a lot of money in some countries, and also having a degree is related to being wealthier. So yes, maybe it's not a direct causal link, we can find dumb rich people and smart poor people, but it's pretty obvious that it is a big, maybe the biggest factor.
Also matters on what you mean by intelligence, IQ or capabilities. Even if you mean IQ, people with high IQ tend to be wealthier on average.
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:04:37
I'm sorry, I don't know too much about this, but if we are talking about a government matter (choosing officials and voting) in what way will blockchain technology help? If we are going to make voting mandatory (meaning that you'll involve law enforcement in the case of a person not voting) why don't have a system where you trust a central authority? You already have to trust them to ensure mandatory voting no?
I'm just sick and tired of people trying to push a blockchain solution to problems that might as well be solved by a server. I think Andreas Antonopoulos once said that if in your blockchain project you can replace the word "blockchain" with "database" and the project still makes as much sense you probably should just use a database and not jump on the hype train that has been crypto these past few years.
Our current system has a lot of problems, but just enumerating them and then saying the magic word "blockchain" doesn't solve the underlying problems, I just want to understand what's the role it will have.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:21:13
well I think that the best way to suss out the priorities of the population is to let them elect officials. We can't have them vote regularly first of all because that would take a lot of time to form consensus and secondly because you don't want every citizen involved in some decisions because it would lead to populism and propaganda.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:07:42
People are going to be vulnerable to propaganda and will vote with their emotions no matter what and I don't understand how you want to fix that with blockchain.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:45:00
Well then we have an inherently different view of the world. I am always open to being proven wrong, but I believe that there is no way to solve some problems without having the society degrade into "bigger gun diplomacy", and I believe that authority and centralization have a place in this world, and that there are issues where they are the best solution. I don't hold the idealistic view that everything should or could be solved through peer to peer solutions. 
I believe that we shouldn't assume that there is a peer to peer solution to everything, but at the same time we shouldn't assume there can't be one (that's why i'm all for trying to solve them, but I won't bother with it since I don't see how that could be possible)
I'm not trying to make any universally applicable rule with that statement, I'm just stating my opinion on the matter.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:14:44
We are using different language to express the same underlying thing.
When I say that I believe in something that belief is based on knowledge, knowledge that is partial based on which I can't call something true or false, based on which I can't have complete certainty. When I believe in something I also base it on some evidence.
In the same way you say that you "claim knowledge" on things you consider yourself as having "sufficient evidence" and here is our problem. For me to use the work "knowledge" I also need "sufficient evidence" but for me that means sufficient evidence to prove is as a knowable fact.
Also, I don't think it would be constructive to go into Rene Decartes, the cogito, phenomenology and metaphysics here in order to get to the roots of what we can and can't know for certain, especially since we pretty much agree on how you should form your beliefs.
I personally hope you don't associate the term "belief" with any sort of religious connotation, and if you did so, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:06:17
Oh, are we only looking at millionaires or just at average wealth? This might change the equation a bit, since extremely rich people are a extremely smaller part of the general population, so making any general statements about them gets harder.

@_date: 2019-07-31 15:23:33
Well I think we have a different view on human nature, since you think that people aren't selfish enough to refuse taxation, and that the only reason why they would do that is because they don't know where the money is going, or think that it is misused. 
Also, if you leave it up to the individual to choose where their tax money will go you'll get an inefficient tax system where some parts of the country will get a lot more tax money and others will get a lot less than they need. Sometimes helping poor people isn't really economically viable for the individual, but it is for sure for the state.
As I said in my earlier comment, the problem with a taxation system where you get to choose where your money goes is that the money won't go to the places it is truly needed, and I don't know how you talking about more people paying taxes because of the transparency of blockchain really addresses this problem.

Lol global energy crisis. Mining always happens where the electricity prices are lowest and that is where there is excess(otherwise it would be expensive).
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:07:39
You realize that miners don't grow in trees, and a big part of the bitcoin mined is used to buy storage space, miners, and pay the people that take care of them? Also they have to buy newer miners every time so only a small part of the money you suggest will be used to buy power will actually do that.
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:04:54
It will push energy prices up enough to limit mining before that happens so it won't rise to levels that would warrant something like that. Also banning a decentralised protocol would be a futile effort.
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:20:43
It also feels like you forget that the reward halves every 210,000 blocks and that you also have to take into account the buying of new mining hardware and advances in that area.

The nonphysical nature of bitcoin doesn't make it 'from thin air'. The labor required to make it should be taken into account. That is the thing that is backing it. The price of the piece of paper that says 100$ is worth a few cents, but the power of the USA is the thing backing it. That's why dollars made from thin air still have value.

it's not that bitcoin mining is the sole reason why people buy solar panels, the point is that it is an extra incentive for some people.

I never get people who say that bitcoin incentivizing them to save is a bad thing. Do they spend their money just because it would lose value otherwise? In the current system you can still save money and invest it, the truth is that saving money through investing is hard for someone that is not rich enough. Is giving poor people a way to not get robbed on every penny they save such a bad thing for the economy?
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:03:53
If you can make bitcoin out of thin air just do it. You would be extremely rich. From what I know you need to either mine it or buy it from someone who already has it, and mining 100$ worth of bitcoin is harder than printing a 100$ bill.
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:15:02
Yes, scarcity is a part of what makes it valuable, but it's not the only part. It's all the characteristics that make bitcoin what it is. And I don't want the value of my money to be dictated by an ever-changing entity that i can not fully understand nor control, that can have interests against my interests. Bitcoin not being controlled by one entity, but by consensus, makes me trust it more since it doesn't take care of one group's interests preferentially.

Blockchain can for sure improve voting, I agree with that entirely, but that wasn't what I was discussing in the first place. I also don't know why you would need blockchain to change our voting system from first past the post to another better system.
My original comment was about elected officials being the best way to govern big groups of people and how they can't be replaced by some sort of blockchain implementation without inconveniencing most of the voting population.
You are arguing for using blockchain to make voting better and I agree with you.
I was arguing against using blockchain to make the decisions government officials are making.
If you are arguing for letting the general population vote on any and all matters of the state through some sort of "microvotes" I wholly disagree with you and think that society would descend into a propaganda fueled populism. Stuff like minority rights and other complicated government matters should not be let up to the average person to decide.

You can't just say that the current system has problems and put forth a solution that solves none of them and then behave like we should put it in place just because it is different.
People not having a voice happens because of corrupt politicians not because of the existence of politicians. You can have the narrow view of politics where every politician is a pig trying to fill his pockets with more money, but rushing to a half baked solution  will only bring more problems. 
If there are really such big problems with the system right now the people would go out and protest more. The fact is that in America people are still living a good life and won't risk it for change because frankly it's good enough for them.

dude you really need to calm down. I really believe we agree on most of the stuff you are talking about and I believe blockchain can really help accountability in our voting systems.
What I really need you to understand is that what I was arguing in the first place is that elected officials are the best way to run governments, compared to some other systems that puts every decision big and small in the hands of the general population. I am open to you giving me a way to run government without democratically elected officials with some sort of trustless blockchain, I just don't see how that could happen.


Yes? More people should be protesting in order to force change regarding climate change. I don't see how this statement is so aggravating for you.
You seem to fail to understand that just enumerating issues of the current system is not the same as solving them, and saying that they will be "addressed by blockchain" without putting forth any idea in regards to how that will happen just makes your argument look empty of all substance.

Or do you think it's possible to give an incentive to provide watchtowers?

It also creates a lot of problems that have to be solved in order for it to be the next world currency. For example right now, and in periods when the price of bitcoin is rising, transacting it comes with huge fees. People like to just point at lightning and say that it is the solution to all our problems, and I in some manner agree, I believe that the idea to exchange signed signatures between peers and committing the final balance on the bitcoin blockchain is a great idea, but we need to find a way to make the lighting network go towards a peer to peer mesh, and not to a hub based network ( or at least a combination of the two that will ensure decentralization).
The same way that increasing the block size is a bad solution because it leads to more centralization, using lightning with a hub system is against the principles bitcoin has been founded on, and lightning is a long way away from solving all of our scaling problems.

well maybe when you said "all the developers that have flocked to the ETH blockchain years ago" and "Go compare development between the two, ETH development never stops... I can say the opposite for BTC."
Let's be real, that was what you were implying. Now you can hide behind the fact that you didn't say it directly, or you could own your position.
I personally think both ETH and BTC have a high grade of legitimacy in the space and I believe that instead of having constant fights between these communities we should work out to weed out the really useless cashgrab projects that truly give a bad image to the whole crypto space.
Nevertheless, this isn't really the subreddit for serious discussion about cryptocurrency. Talking about this sub as if it were representative for the crypto space is comparable to talking about being representative of the average investor.

Alright so the nazis using gas to kill the jewish population in extraordinary numbers is just political propaganda and not a well studied, and confirmed times and times again fact? I guess all the historians are and have been working together to push an agenda, or atleast that's easier for you to think than to accept that denying such atrocities is first of all hurtful towards the people that have been affected, and secondly it's empowering the people pushing societal agendas that lead to such catastrophes.
Even though you like to behave like we already live in Orwell's 1984, and use that to deny anything you don't agree with, we still have some degree of freedom to find out what is true.
You can argue as much as you want that platforming people that hold views dangerous to all humanity will not have an impact on the way those views are considered by the general populous, but it's clear that it has an impact, that being the normaliziation of such views.
P.S : As you can see, you are not forced to believe anything, nobody is going to burn you alive because you are a holocaust denier or a "moon truther", but I think that the germans of those times wouldn't be as lenient on dissident thought as the current regime is.

The real problem is that centralization is not an on off switch, it's an always changing range of hardware requirements for running a node (bitcoin or lightning), and there is no set point where we want to be, besides the general guideline that it shouldn't take huge computers that only big businesses can run. I believe that the end user of the bitcoin or lighting service should be able, with a moderate investment of money be able to run a node in order to decide by himself what chain is valid and not just go with miner consensus or in lightning he shouldn't be reliant on the hubs having the map to the whole network.
The problem arises when we need to draw a line, since what is maybe affordable for you in a western first world country may not be so affordable in my eastern european country, and even less affordable in a third world country where their currency is a quickly depreciating asset.

By the time wasting power will be a worry when talking about bitcoin as a mainstream currency, solar and other renewable energy sources will already be widely adopted, so we won't waste anything.
