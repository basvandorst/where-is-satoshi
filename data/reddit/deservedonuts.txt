they do pass on the costs, just in many different ways than that
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:06:51
is this what the inside of your head sounds like? :/
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:14:53
ever tried to sell using them?
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:56:00
yes but can you sell
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:08:57
so you're being purposely obtuse then

how would you find out what the applications are without a whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:13:15
i don't think so. coinbase needs to die but it would leave a vacuum that would really hurt bitcoin. sort of a catch 22.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:44:11
of course; i'm just saying that his opinions may or may not apply to this kind of weird market
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:19:45
how can you use electrum on an offline computer?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:01
do you deny that it at least *looks* shady when taking into account everything that happened today?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:00:43
yeah but i don't know if coinbase released them or what.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:17
yes, the intentions of bitcoin, the sentient cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:34
actually it's done better, percentage-wise; it's pegged to a BTC ratio and that has gone up over the past couple weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:31:45
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:09
good reply
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:48
which subs are you browsing? r/btc is celebrating the increase in price and talking about how r/bitcoin is full of morons.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:36
yup 5 centuries is exactly the same as 9 years
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:34:09
of course not

utterly irrelevant
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:06:54
k i forgot that you are bitcoin and refer to yourself in the 3rd person
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:22
i wouldn't suggest anyone buy (or sell) bitcoin right now. but it's happening anyway. i don't know what to tell you other than it will get better. this mass wave of adoption shows bitcoin has potential but it needs to fulfill that potential.
depending on when you bought your btc, you might be better off now regardless, but it does suck to feel trapped.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:00:24


go on
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:22
lots of people are using things like ethereum as currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:56
that's not much of an answer, do you have any specifics?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:26
what is BCH's long-term solution to any of those issues? could BCH handle the stress that BTC's network is under now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:21
you can spread it about things that are temporarily true, yeah.
why don't you like ETH?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:51:13
it's a billionaire's childish tantrum throwing, whatever. just saying, performance is percentages.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:44:34
so glad this is getting upvoted. this sub too often comes off as circlejerk central.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:52
i guess they're betting on BCH being the new king so it won't matter how much BTC they have.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:47:03
weird, almost like multiple people with self-contained non-contradictory worldviews say different things on the internet
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:29:52
99.9999% of it
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:34
wow, chauvinist much? be careful where you swing that rage boner.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:21:48
how does BCH plan to deal with scaling and centralization?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:43:50


lol that's some strong spin you got there
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:57
you're talking in platitudes, which is kind of ridiculous considering how volatile cryptos are. you have to define a time scale.
in the past 5 years, weeks? yeah you'd have done well to hold BTC. but these markets are too wild to say anything is a 'safe bet' other than not playing. and you'd have done _better_ to buy BCH when it was low and sell it now, obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:31
yeah. i really don't understand why it hasn't been implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:54
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:45:05
how did they think people wouldn't notice?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:56:57
you can't really use roads to get around traffic unless you already know where you're going within the city's streets. and it will seldom be faster unless the congestion is huge, but off-streets would be clogged with traffic too eventually.
but the metaphor about more lanes is interesting otherwise. still, with all the money and attention spread over cryptos right now, wouldn't it behoove us to at least prove to newcomers that it works? taking half a day and spending a significant amount to do so doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:45
cause our tax laws are ludicrous
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:48:12
it's incredible that he has a shred of validity to anyone after that
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:46:21
i think most volume for people who buy now is in the interest of selling them to someone else, not using it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:05:44
glad you disputed any point he made
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:53
well, to be fair, it has been proven to work. working on a large scale has yet to be seen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:58:19
as usual though that's only in hindsight. i make the most money when i'm really hands-off with my coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:16
i don't disagree with you, but when we're talking about the kind of absurd fees bitcoin has right now then it only makes sense to use something else. it's down to usability; public opinion is gonna turn on bitcoin in favor of those that are actually usable for small transactions. unless something changes soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:19
how is bch going to implement on-chain scalability?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:12
can't, or hasn't?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:45:34

OP, this is from the [Electrum website]( Follow these steps:










@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:40
a well-coordinated pump and dump and a huge smear campaign against BTC (despite having nothing to show for why BCH is better in the long term).
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:58
your post history was so good until you started posting :|
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:14:39


what do you mean?
and the USD inflationary so you lose value the longer you keep them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:06
if they dumped it down to nothing people would snap them up at the low prices. if they slowly and surely chip away at the price then they might manage to scare enough people away from BTC (and probably cryptos in general).
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:27:35
of course! he deserves everyone else's money and we should applaud him for fucking over so many people.

that is only the way things have been up to now, which is science. consistently and correctly predicting future outcomes is the sign of a good hypothesis but absolute certainty is inherently unscientific.
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:23:10
now you're being crazy :v)
@_date: 2016-06-05 10:40:51

@_date: 2016-06-05 07:55:50
partly true but then again this is the bitcoin subreddit
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:57:53
and don't buy immediately after the price jumps up 25% is usually a good idea
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:34:22
learn from it

bitcoin - less fungible than fiat. you read it here
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:27:30
outside of scientists and people talking about science, people seldom are referring to theory in the scientific sense of the word.
common use of the word is closer to "hypothesis", which is a semi-informed guess.
@_date: 2016-06-03 20:19:58
lol ok

WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SPEND LESS THAN A CENT

@_date: 2017-11-20 00:18:40
yeah, i mean i don't disagree with what you said in the comment, but your tone and prose read like you had too much adderall my dude. someone who has that attitude probably doesn't have much investment in bitcoin and you're basically screaming your head off at a person who couldn't care less.

i've used the site for years and it only recently started crapping out on me. this post helped me...
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:50:03
it’s down to how much confidence people have in things going back to how they were i think.
gold is a physical thing and doesn’t require a vast network of computers to maintain its existence (nevermind fungibility). i think it would have value even if society totally broke down, just because people associate it with value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:49:09
i thought dogecoin was already scrypt
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:26:29
no it isn't lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:56:14
i told everyone who asked me about it that i wouldn't personally invest once it went past 15k because it happened too fast. everyone thought bitcoin was dead when it spiked up in the past, lots of people got caught up in the hype and fear those times too. i've held on this long 'cause i think it has value regardless of the dollar amount you can get for one, but i can't say it didn't suck watching it crash after gox went insolvent. but i just let my coins be.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:56:21
i'm so glad poloniex got rid of the chat, it was full of this sort of ridiculous guru shite.
