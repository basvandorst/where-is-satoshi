Yeah at the end of each TTL period, you'll have tests run on the law through Continuous Integration. The tests will essentially be re-votings or referendums to refresh the cache that is the current set of laws each node that's the citizen should follow.

You find the solution for the pool. The pool broadcasts the block. You can't compile the block yourself and broadcast it arbitrarily.
It is up to the pool to decide exactly how much to pay you.

I am not blaming Bitstamp here, I am saying Incapsula was reckless. It would be unrealistic to expect Bitstamp to switch DDoS providers as someone has to pay the providers. They can't just break their contract and sign another one overnight.

Sure, OP_RETURN &lt;DATA&gt; lets us embed data into the transaction output but this would require clients to actively search for such information.
Which would increase the processing overhead, and constitute an issue for thin clients such as Electrum. Electrum Server would have to know about the public key of the Mr. Receiver to actively watch for incoming transactions. This would definitely compromise anonymity since you are now associated with an IP address.

Interception or not it wouldn't make a difference. Have the malware generate a random key, encrypt files with that and send it over to the C&amp;C server. 
This process would be no different than generating a public key from the embedded private key, encrypting the files and sending it to the C&amp;C server.

No, you aren't charging people's credit cards to give them Bitcoins. You buy stuff for people and they pay you in Bitcoins. The problem here is, if they are shipping it directly to you, no way to know if they are using stolen credit cards. You will get in trouble for carding.
If it isn't directly shipped to you, but rather reshipped by the buyer, there is no way to know if he actually shipped the item. He might have shipped an empty box. Who will the intermediate site believe?

Why would increasing the blocksize increase the increase in blockchain size per year? We have a certain number of transactions occurring through the span of a block anyway.

Makes sense. I think I was just overestimating the effect that missing a couple blocks would have.
However, you would agree that nobody can spend FBI's seized coins without their private key, and therefore, you can ignore their transactions only when you have above 50%. When you lose that, they can spend their coins. And the longer you don't have the hashrate superiority, the harder it will get for you to ignore their transactions. Because you need to mine in parallel to the rest of the network.

Except 50+% doesn't guarantee that you will be the fastest in the network.
Think of it that way T0-&gt;T1-&gt;T2-&gt;........-&gt;Ta (FBI spends coins)
You reject that block, create your own and exclude FBI's transaction. But at that time, someone happened to come up with the next block before you did. Now you need to have two blocks, and since you don't have 66% of the hashing power, you probably will fail. Miss that block as well, and you'll need even more significant hashing power.
Your whole 'ignoring' attack relies on the chance that you'll get the next block as FBI spends the coins. If you miss that, the train will likely be too far ahead to be caught. If you get that block, you should still get the next ones to make sure that they can't spend it on the next one. And we all know that there will be exceptions to who gets the next block. It is never always the same person. Whenever that happens, Bitcoin will be dead because it will effectively be centralized.

It wouldn't be a firmware upgrade. They are called ASICs for a reason. They are Application Specific Integrated Circuits. Algorithms are implemented on a gate-level and that's why they are fast.
Trying to get rid of pools is a bad idea. Pools might look like they are centralizing the network right now but imagine how much worse it would be  if we had no pools and a dozen big players. With pools, in case the pool misbehaves, we can at least contain the damage by urging everyone to quit mining on a certain pool. If we had no pools, we wouldn't have a mass of miners to migrate. We would be at the mercy of a dozen of giant mining operations.

They are also going on and on about how Amazon is the most secure cloud ever and they are awesome for utilizing it. None of this actually matters as long as they aren't controlling the hardware, and they most certainly are not. Whatever they say, Amazon is a third-party and they have root.

Dude, I met these people in SF and had a chance to talk about their vision of the product. There isn't much that they currently offer and what they will offer in the future is essentially a glorified RaspPi running bitcoind with a wrapper that exposes an API.

What makes you think that it will go back up in December? Are you referring to ASIC mining equipment? If so, wouldn't that actually lower the prices?
My logic is that there will be an increase in the amount of BTC mined, and this will increase the supply while the demand is virtually the same as before.
@_date: 2012-08-17 19:35:12
What is with this recent drop? 15$ to 13$?
@_date: 2012-08-25 21:00:41
Just tried it, and received nothing. Blockchain doesn't show any transactions either.

GitHub provides a public API to monitor activity on all public repositories. It is trivial to write a bot that follows the event stream to find authentication tokens and API keys. That's almost certainly what happened here. Unfortunately, I doubt Coinbase will be ~~able~~ willing to help.
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:18:01
Yes, I am pretty certain you should be able to do that. Contact CoinBase through their support, their email and their social network accounts. Canceling a pending Bitcoin purchase made via your debit card should be done rather easily. If they are reluctant at taking action, notify your bank of the fraudulent charges on your account and have them reverse it. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:46:27
You have interesting usernames to say the least. :)
Regardless, this is a backend issue. It doesn't matter which application the user generates the tokens with. The issue is with how the server verifies it. Coinbase uses Authy as their 2FA backend and there are many other websites that do the same. (CloudFlare, Coinbase, Cryptsy, CEXIO to name a few familiar ones)

I personally would rather live in a fantasy that isn't purely speculative.

There should be reviews. But it shouldn't stop at that. Account creation is very easy even with all these "verifications" that practically serve no purpose. This person has connected his LinkedIn account and Facebook account. Wow, he must be trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:23:11
They are fast with customer service, slow with transactions. Having to wait for a week is a deal-breaker for me.
Also try reaching them without exposing them on Reddit. You'll either not hear back or hear back two weeks later. That's the beauty of the BTC community. We communicate well and these startups know that they are bound to fail if they get a bad reputation.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:35:49
Thanks for the reply, and the gold. I just submitted all my verification documents and it felt good encrypting everything.
EDIT: Wow, verification was very fast and painless. I wish you guys had a domestic (US) bank account. My bank doesn't let me do international wire transfers online.

Your best bet is to find a time when Bitstamp and MtGox are very close in BTC prices. Buy BTC on Gox, transfer to Stamp and sell there.

I know I am bombarding you with questions but there doesn't seem to be an article out there that explains what the best practices here are. Once I figure everything out, I am planning on writing one.
Yes, I *can* delete the wallet.dat and start over but is this a good practice? Is there a better way? If I don't do this, will wallet.dat grow uncontrollably? With such a big and technical community behind it, it is hard to believe that I can't find an answer to these questions just by going to the Bitcoin Wiki.
I can also do dumpprivkey on these accounts and store them on a remote database? This is probably a bad practice but how can a developer starting to interface with Bitcoind for the first time know that? 
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:36:19
I use this when I'm in Turkey and fall back to Coinbase when I am in the US. BitStamp has a very painless verification procedure and they are just great with customers.
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:27:07
I wouldn't expect anything better from a company that's trying to maintain the security of their API through obfuscating the client-side binary.
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:12:41
- Takes a week to receive the coins.
- Level 2 verification requires giving them your SSN. Not everyone has an SSN, and not everyone likes giving away their SSN. 
- Even after giving them your SSN, they ask you ridiculous questions about your past. 
- Even after answering those questions, there is a chance that they won't deem those answers correct. Happened to me. I think I know where I spent my childhood better than you do, Coinbase.
- They also require giving them your credit card information.
- Even after doing all these, they might just decide that your deposits are 'high-risk', and cancel them.
Don't get me wrong, Coinbase is definitely better than MtGox. I have a hard time understanding why they don't keep a 'USD balance' on their website. When I sell Bitcoins, I don't want you to immediately transfer them to my bank account. I would prefer keeping them there.
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:17:56
Thanks for the advice but I already have a verified account at CampBX and BitStamp. They are awesome and I love working with them. I use them when I'm buying Bitcoin or cashing out. I want to use MtGox for trading since they have the highest trade volume.
@_date: 2013-10-19 03:02:27
They wouldn't need much. The backend isn't exposed to the user anyway. Copying the frontend is trivial.

I found the answer on Bitcoin.it Wiki:

I am getting the error page from Incapsula. Hopefully they'll  go up soon.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:06:10
It has been resolved but it was very stressful for sure. CampBX is not a scam, they are just extremely understaffed. It is a one-man operation and his sister occasionally helps him by picking up the mail etc.
Support replied to my ticket after I posted the residential address and phone number of their owner, and said I'll take legal action. They apologized and told me that the 'check cleared' notification didn't reach them from the bank and got lost in mail. I eventually got my account funded but it was harder than it should have been.
TL;DR: They are not a scam but they have lost my business.
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:38:03

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:07:02
So what would that mean for short-term investors? Looking at the graph, it seems like people are buying with low prices and trying to sell at high prices. Buyers and sellers can't decide on a price.
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:25:16

Aside from that, what do you mean by a killer app?

Turkish redditor here. I primarily live in United States but am currently in Turkey.
Turks are withdrawing their money from the banks as a form of protest. It probably won't be permanent.
It isn't that easy getting BTC here. Using Bitstamp is probably the best option with SEPA transfers. I did it and it doesn't cost that much.
The bank that's being protested here is Garanti Bank and their shares went down by 13% today. You should note that the market went down by 10% today due to the recent unrest. 
You should note that this is a very different situation than Cyprus. Turkey normally has a stable economy.

That is definitely not the case. All SR activity would only show itself as 'buying bitcoins' from the banks perspective. From the law enforcement perspective, this is not the way it is handled. Controlled deliveries are made instead.
@_date: 2013-10-19 03:23:54

Incapsula is top-notch. BitStamp uses Incapsula while MtGox uses Prolexic. They both are pretty much tied for best DDoS protection technology.

@_date: 2013-11-25 20:14:25
I am an undergraduate student in CS and just like every other CS major out there, I am not great with reading whitepapers. 
As simple as [Bitcoin Whitepaper]( is, I have some questions that might use clarification:


hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number 
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
Is there a smarter way than brute-force to check if the SHA-256 hash of a value starts with n number of zeros? Miners can merely just be brute-forcing. I understand that this is intentionally resource-intensive, but the keyspace is just huge.
From the whitepaper, I can't really understand how everything relate to each other.




Alright, node A gets all the transactions into a block. Node B does the same, so does Node C.


Are we talking about the 'finding SHA256 starting with n number of zeros' here? Aren't multiple nodes working on the same block, theoretically? What if one finishes it before the other? Isn't the other node working for nothing then? There is some disturbing redundancy/inefficiency here. And how does this validate anything anyway? 


Broadcasts the hash? How does this play a role in the system? Maybe the whitepaper assumes that this would be intuitively obvious, but not to me.


How do the other nodes check if this is the case? They can't possibly be going back in blockchain, that would have horrible runtime. Suppose that's the case, how does this check actually happen? 


chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
So if the node accepts the block, it starts working on a new one and appending that to the chain that it was working on? Do we have multiple chains going on at the same time? If so, haven't we already agreed to only work on the longest one? Is that 'the blockchain'? Do we really have multiple of these that we just disregard? How did they emerge in the first place?


extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some 
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, 
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. 
Again, why do we have multiple branches?
Can someone explain me these two images? 
1)  
How are transactions turned into hashes like that? How are they combined into one hash? If we are storing them in the form of hashes, how do we know how much that transaction is worth? How do we know who paid whom?
2) 
We again see the hashes taken from the previous transaction, just to be hashed again using the next owner's public key. How does this work?
I can't see anything online that's explaining it on this level. People are usually explaining it in very simple ways and avoiding explaining these details while these details are actually the ones that matter.
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:53:53
I doubt it will affect the US players at all. People who use Bitcoin to gamble are tech-savvy enough to know how to use a proxy, or just note down the SatoshiDice addresses and keep gambling without accessing the website.

Saw your thread earlier today and wanted to give this a try myself. As far as I can see, there is no delay here. I primarily use RTBTC.com to monitor BitStamp's prices and trades, and I also implemented a simple Pusher reader using Ruby. I am printing the timestamps myself, they aren't coming from the server. As you can see there is basically no delay.
Has this been fixed? Is that the reason?
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:24:12
They are fighting Bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:37:06
They would not be without knowing your password. 
However, someone using your computer can put a keylogger on your computer, logging your keystrokes. They can also get a copy of your wallet.dat and decrypt it using the password they acquired through this keylogger.

Holy shit, this looks awesome. Very creative.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:07:39
Very simple. If you are in Europe, it is near free through a SEPA transfer. If not, it is just an international wire transfer that doesn't cost too much.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:09:43
See that's exactly what I was asking. I am trying to accept Bitcoins on my website but I dont want to use a preexisting solution. I want to interface with Bitcoind through RPC. Which I can without any problems.

I am giving you my SSN, your system is asking me questions and not accepting my answers on top of that. I am sorry but I think I know where I spent my childhood better than your system does. What's up with giving me names of random people and asking me if I know them?
These kind of errors combined with perpetually downgrading your service without any explanation is a surefire way to failure as a company.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:34:19
I'm sorry for your loss. Stryder tried a similar thing with me. It was obvious from the beginning but I wanted to play along. He claimed that escrow wasn't working and that he contacted support. 2 hours later he said support didn't reply back, maybe we should go outside escrow. It was blatantly obvious at that point. Never use Bitcoinary without escrow.
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:09:53

It won't go down to $0.00, I can assure you of that. I doubt it will go down to $100 to be honest. For all we know, we can find ourselves stabilized at $200 at the end of today.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:41:28
No problem.
I am currently using Coinbase to purchase Bitcoins (when the market is stable) to exchange on BitStamp. Coinbase is problematic in many ways but honestly it is one of the only options to buy BTC in the US. Localbitcoins might work too if you are in a big city. I have a verified account on BitStamp and a European bank account (because I was born there).

Upon receiving the funds, should I send them to cold storage? Paper wallets are okay to send money into but not reusable once you withdraw, right?
Also I am not sure if I remember correctly but is there delete account functionality that I can use through the RPC API?
@_date: 2013-05-26 15:36:45
You are stating the obvious. This already happens. Whether it is on Silkroad or on other markets and more obscure forums, Bitcoin is used almost exclusively for contraband and software.
I doubt the absence of LR will change anything. Bitcoin was already dominating the market.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:27:26
They technically do wire transfers. However, if you actually try to withdraw, they'll tell you that there is a year long queue.

@_date: 2013-12-15 19:58:29
I know accounts can't be 'destroyed' from existence, they'll always be a part of the blockchain. By deleting accounts, I mean deleting them from my wallet.dat. My logic is that the filesize will get impossible after some point and the bitcoind will try to keep track of their balance for all the now-redundant accounts, wasting valuable system resources. So after moving the funds from those addresses to the cold-storage, is it possible to delete those entries from my bitcoind?


I remember hearing about paper-wallets are only good for 'sweep' transactions. Let's say that I have 10BTC in my paper wallet and I move 1BTC to another address. As far as I remember, my paper wallet will now contain no BTC because the tx is generated, and that yielded another transaction to return the remaining of the funds to a new address. Can you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:52:47
That's absolutely ridiculous. You have the grounds to sue them. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:08:24
