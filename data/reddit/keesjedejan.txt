Doesn't that mean that mining profitability will decrease and therefore hashrate will move to other coins?

That's true, didn't think about that. But with a fee percentage of almost 0, Bcash will probably be in trouble if they reach another reward halving point, am I right?

Also, BCH adjusted it's difficulty algorithm, so that it changes very fast. This ensures the BCH chain will not die when hashrate goes almost to zero, but also ensures the difficulty will go very fast up if they drain hashrate from BTC. It also protects BTC.
 
Furthermore, [BTC difficulty will not go up.]( Actually OP is probably new and panicking because he read something on @_date: 2017-11-03 09:26:19
Depends in the country you live in. If you live in the USA, yeah, that might be the case, but I don't think OP is in the USA. If he is, I doubt his decision, but if he's in a country with income-dependent monthly payments, his decision is right.

Nobody says they're buying, but a lot of people are saying they gonna sell. Which means a low price for 2x. 2x might have a higher hashrate after the fork and miners will get more fees, but those are fees of a coin which doesn't translate to anything valuable. 
 
Even if 2x would be objectively a better coin, that doesn't mean 2x will become bitcoin eventually.

Obviously that is the case, but it is a p2p thing, based on rules. Now the point is, there will be 2 sets of rules after the fork. It would be very clear if Coinbase would call set 1, Set 1 and set 2, Set 2. Now Coinbase will swapping the 1 and 2 around, based on hashrate. And it turns out, Coinbase is the '2' in p2p, and brings the two 'p's' together. It is very confusing if p1 is selling stuff, based on Set 1 and at the moment p2 wants to buy that, it is called Set 2 suddenly.
 
We all know Set 1, or BTC will be the winner in the long run, but Coinbase is deliberately slowing down that process, by creating chaos in the naming.

Does gdax make sure you can't get replay attacked this soon after the fork happened?
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:56:52
The thing is, you could mislead him big time, and he wouldn't even realise it. Do research yourself, don't let someone do it for you.

They leave an opening though. If after the fork, both hashrate and market price is in favor of 2x, they will rename.

Does Coinbase split your coins for you after the fork? Haven't read anything about that, and the segwit2x fork does not have replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:57:27
Theoratically, yes. But in practice the miners will try to force the market cap of 2x by keeping the hashrate high. Very nice of them, selling 2x will be pretty fast, so I can buy BTC of that moneyz.

Might be more interesting to leave your coins at Coinbase then, if you aren't too sure about splitting coins yourself (like me). Does this also hold for putting your coins on Coinbase from cold storage after the fork, without splitting them first yourself?

So do I. You're literally saying you want to set a sell order for a low price. That doesn't make sense.
