well after the dot com bubble the internet didn't go away, these cryptostartups with literally nothing to show will evaporate.

This guy really gets it. Though his beliefs are not entirely anatchist if at all but is a man that deserves resprct ant taken into account

It says nothing to back up his arguments perhaps except this: 


And this is very serious because holders underestimate this. Why? well if you want the price to go *...to the moon* you need to let people in. Now what I believe is happening from experience, most people are finding it really hard if not impossible to enter the exchanges to buy cryptos. The middle class around the world is dead, now you can be a highly skilled individual with higher knowledge and struggle to make ends meet. The middle class could have the power to pump the price up, but with a saturated market, a plethora of altcoins and no purchasing/investing power, aka money to spare it is getting extremely difficult to get into a game where most people think-believe it is already too late. That's why people with some money are looking for the next coin-asset-token that will take them *to the moon* because it's to late for bitcoin they missed it. 
However bitcoin or crypto for that matter is not going away or going to die, the game however is going to change drastically and if you ask me it is already happening

To be honest haven't given much thought about it because it's out off my buck so it's really high risk with very little ROI. Obviously people do it and have profit, otherwise they wouldn't do it. I don't know about hashtanks, care to  share?
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:16:16
low class? no no no

bitcoin mining is done by specialized hardware (ASICS) and unless you invest  **A LOT** of money in hardware your ROI is not going to make you a millionaire. Better invest that money straight in bitcoin and hold.

when you employ alex jones material to back your arguments about bitcoin, when more serious arguments/material can be found easily, then you can tell that the bitcoin &amp; the community is fucked.
