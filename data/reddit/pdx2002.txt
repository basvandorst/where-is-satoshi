Just checked out localbitcoins.com and wow it really seems expensive  according to the at the moment bitcoin price. The top one on the list is like $36 premium to the actual price. 
If I'm not mistaken it looks like I could send the Bitcoin I've purchased on Coinbase to my wallet on localbitcoin.com

I have US dollars to make the purchase and have already done so. I want to do more, a lot more, but suddenly feeling foolish. I know the methods I'm just concerned with the safety. Sorry if I wasn't clear.

Great read. Ah those "idiots" that we're buying 300-400 coins for chump change. Damn.

I do feel foolish though. I don't even know how to get them off. Sure I could transfer them I'm sure but to where. I know I should have been researching this a lot more but I was exuberant when it hit $600 and now look at it. Such a nice problem but a problem none the less. That and I'd like to really, *really*, buy a lot more.

Either have I but I keep reading that when using Coinbase you don't actually have the coins and that they have the coins. If something were to happen, and I'm not even sure what, they're gone. 
I'm nervous because I'm wanting to put a lot (a lot to me) of money there. 
I will say that upon advise given here I've opened an account with "localbitcoins.com" and bought a Trezor so I'm guessing that will provide better security. Again, forgive me for any ignorance.
