And therein lies the reason crypto-currency exists. To stop big corporations from telling you where you cannot spend your hard earned money. 
Here's to to moon boys ��

Just search on the internet, do all the research you can. Before putting all £1000 in do a test of £5 or around there to make sure you understand the processes etc. If you're planning on buying Bitcoin from Coinbase (which a lot of people seem to start out with) get a Revolut account; this will allow you to deposit money, change it to Euros and do a SEPA payment to Coinbase - that's my method since Coinbase doesn't accept straight GBP and/or your bank would charge a fortune to convert it to Euros and send it. 
Coinbase and GDax are the same thing, buy bitcoin from GDax as it doesn't add hefty fees unlike Coinbase. It's hard to get used to at first but research research research.
In terms of a wallet, a hardware/ cold storage wallet is the most safest. If you're planning on hodling definitely go for a ledger nano s or a trezor. (And buy directly from their sites, or their list of trusted sellers) &lt;- it's another £75 or £100 respectively but who wouldn't want to protect £1000 worth of bitcoin which will surely be worth a lot more in the future. 
I'm fairly new, I've been in the game less than a week but I've done tons of research, asked a lot of lovely people on this sub questions as to understand bitcoin even more.  
Feel free to ask anymore question if you have them, and I'll try to give my best answer, if not I'm sure someone else will.

There's so many 'OVER £9000' memes to be had though!

Hmm maybe it's best actually. Don't want to many people to know how much I plan on getting either

If she doesn't know your wallet address, she can't take anything ��

If you put it into bitcoin be prepared to hodl through the dips, don't be tempted to cash out at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:33:21
Sure is!
