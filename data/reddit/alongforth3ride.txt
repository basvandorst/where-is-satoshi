I am not familiar with that issue.  Whats wrong with bigger block sizes? What was the sentiment around this topic you speak of in your original post?

Aka this is a private ledger(s)?

The only thing people think of when they hear 'Bitcoin" is money laundering, drugs and most recently terrorists.  Do you really blame them for not mentioning that?

Bitcoins market cap is 6.49 Billion.  Where did you get this stat from?  "Two billion dollars’ worth of bitcoin is traded every day."

 IMO seems like everything is still a mystery and a idea high up in the clouds(for now).  Bitcoin was built off of anonymity, which is EXACT opposite of what banks need; along with private ledger.  They need AML/KYC which BT has nothing of.  I recently heard someone say. "No one trusted the cloud in the beginning" but now its seems a lot more accepted and trusted.  Its a very hard pill to swollow when you are trying to pitch a system (disti ledger) where all your data is stored on every node, everyone has it but can ONLY view it with a private key.  Hahah rant over

How do you store(uplaod?) Hash keys to the bitcoin blockchain?

Can you elaborate on your statement? Whats wrong with bigger blocks? That seems to be an important question to blockchain devs.

Lets talk IS/LM?! Recently i read a post from CoinDesk stating that China demand for BTC has recently gone up and accounts for almost half of all BTC market. Recently China's central bank,  PBC has shifted LM (Mony supply) right, increasing the money supply in means to boast economic output.  Depending how long and how easy the policy (hovish) lasts, china demand for BTC will probably only keep increasing causing a deep shadows market in that region. But also having great in packed on the "under banked"  There will be a time the PBC will go the opposite and want to decrease the money suppy. Which you can bet easy money to flow out of BTC.

He is right. Bitcoin is NOT going to replace the dollar but the technology behind bitcoin will revolutionise the financial industry.

Excellent points, good read.

Interesting to see how they are going to support it on the backend.  Maybe like a Hadoop or Cassandra type setup.

How is this any different the Venmo?
