I think if I were able to purchase that on a whim, I would shit on your opinion of what color I chose lol...

There are these things called credit and debit cards that have certain protections attached to them in the unfortunate event that they are stolen. This technology is not new and wasn't the issue anyway, so I'm not sure what you're getting at.

Well, that could have all been avoided by just traveling with access to fiat, or is that too crazy of an idea?

I don't believe that 13% figure. Seems a bit high for the amount of people that actually own crypto. Looking at the study it looks a bit misleading. One of the options for the survey was "Have used cryptocurrency" as a payment method, which doesn't necessarily mean regular usage or adoption, but possibly as a one time thing at some point or another. Just my 2 cents.

I lurk in both subs and read about both projects. Your concerns of them using the bitcoin name brand definitely have some merit, but they seem to have addressed the issue of scalability; at least for now. If anything is going to prevent Bitcoin from becoming a mainstream payment system it is going to be that problem. I sincerely hope there is going to be some sort of upgrade coming soon or this rally is not going to last. I don't necessarily like the BCH leadership, but they do have a development team that is actually allowing them to progress the project. This is an objective observation not driven by emotion or ignorance. It has been over a year and bitcoin still cannot handle the transaction volume.

Sure, any one of these can get the job done better than Bitcoin can. BCH was just the one mentioned earlier as an alternative. I don't understand the hostility towards using a different coin for payment; it's childish.

Jesus, calm the fuck down. At this very moment with high fees and backed up transactions i doubt it would be a very pleasant experience with BTC anyway. BCH is actually a decent alternative. I own neither by the way.
