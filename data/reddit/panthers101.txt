Thanks for the pep talk champ.

Yes, if you are skilled enough at scouring the Bitcoin blockchain for clues.
The transaction data is available online for anyone to look through.

Of course, IF you can win your trades against multi-million dollar algorithms run by supercomputers designed to scalp the living shit out of every BTC chartist on the planet. I don't know how big your positions are, how many times you move in and out of trades or how much leverage you use but I'd be awfully careful and trade a lot less when the volatility picks back up.
Right now it's obviously much easier to time the market because, as I mentioned in my original post, all the institutional suits have dried up the supply in dark pools and the markets have barely had a pulse (until this latest dump).

Lol. Ok 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:55:14
I agree with that! Good point.

Doing for money what the Internet did for information. Which means killing the bloodsucking intermediaries and returning wealth to the people.

You're totally right. The sell offs are imperative to bring in new capital. My point is that this new capital is very sophisticated institutional money out to shake as much BTC as they can from the retail crowd.
And I just genuinely want the early investors to keep their nest egg intact for the future. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:36:26
that would be a colloquial term for institutional finance, my friend.

Maybe I'm just trying to give a cautionary word of advice to others so they don't unwittingly give their Bitcoin to Goldman Sachs.
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:59:17
Yes, pretty obviously if we're talking about nothing but the pure pursuit of profit. Believe it or not, some people think it's about a lot more than making money and would rather see the ecosystem continue to be more grounded in it's libratarian roots instead of taken over by Wall Street.
I'm aware that buying it lower will yield better returns in the future. Haha

Cool ;) sorry for yelling at you earlier. Turns out we probably see things in exactly the same way. 
I'm a macroeconomics guy so I'm always looking at the big picture. I am not suited for trading, and envy anyone who is able to consistently profit in this market.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:10:50
Yeah look I mean you have a fair point there. I'd rather as much of that purchasing power stay with individuals. I just know the people who are getting wrecked are the retail traders and I hate to see good people get Hoodwinked by the high frequency trading playbook - quote stuffing, spoofing, layering, etc.
I also think Bitcoin and Wall Street are inherently incompatible, with the former created to neutralize the centralized power of the latter.
It's very philosophical for me, I'm not going to pretend like making money doesn't matter but I believe it's about so much more than just profiting off another emerging asset class.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:20:45
I also am terribly disappointed with the SEC on their handling of this. By dragging their feet they are essentially choosing to protect the "would-be" interests of the institutional investor over the retail investor who has been exposed to the space for years.
They are still applying their backward thought process to crypto, which doesn't work that way. The market will exist with or without their approval.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:51:10
Good advice!
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:16:46
Haha, yeah. We definitely agree on that. I prefer intellectual discussions over internet vitriol personally.
Yep, I worked at an investment bank for several years, specializing in emerging technology research so I have a pretty good overall feel for the tech and its potential impact on the global financial infrastructure.
I'm personally fascinated by the tech, and think it can be a positive driving force for everyone, given the right adoption process and legal/regulatory framework is put in place.

@_date: 2018-10-10 23:04:32
THANK YOU! This is brilliant.
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:46:11
Dude I don't even trade, I hope you draw better conclusions in the market than you do on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:18:36
Yeah, agree. I just don't want to see anyone panicking in an unnatural way. Gladly most people like yourself know what's going on but I've heard some horror stories from others and I hate seeing people give away their BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:43:23
Your suspicions are well founded. I can promise you 100%, as someone who has worked on Wall Street that this is EXACTLY what is happening. The reason there has been no volume on exchanges is because all the big boys are sucking out all the supply in dark markets. 
You're doing the right thing!
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:08:29
Glad to know I'm not alone!
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:38:39
I can't imagine - people who are wondering where all the volume is and predicting the collapse of crypto have obviously never heard of over-the-counter transactions before
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:56:58
Knowledge is power brother. I want to see the people fight back and call bullshit on Wall Street.
They are betting against that.
Are we going to prove them right or wrong?
