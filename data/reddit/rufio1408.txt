£6.99 per month to 'unlock' crypto currencies... yeah... hard pass on that one.

So they won't verify UK accounts? I'm fine with taking my banks Euro rates. Just confused as to why after 2 deposits over a week old they're not linking the account. (Halifax)

If miners leave then the difficulty to mine corrects.
If the transaction fees tank and all the miners leave then we will all be able to go back to mining with sub standard cpus.
As long as there are 2 or more people mining, we're good

Thanks, I'll check it out
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:24:49
Thanks for the advice, might give it a go tomorrow. Is there a long verification process? I don't mind (19 days until he tax bill haha)
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:46:19
And who would that be?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:16:38
Milk and 2 please buddy

I'm fine with withdrawing euros. That's what I sent the SEPA payment in (with a shit load of bank charges, long live crypto etc etc) 
It just seems that coinbase won't verify my bank for withdrawal regardless of currency 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:21:14
Is it trustworthy?
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:00:13
So can you explain how I would go about transferring my coinbase balance (Euro/GBP or other) into my revolut account? Because I just seem to be coming up against adds and extra purchase options

This is actually really handy. Also I read once that if you make 7% gains 10 times you double your original money. If you're into day trading...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:41
Yup, that face has pretty much been my default expression these last 48 hours
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:26:26
I've seen this one mention a couple times over the last few days but never heard of it before. Trustworthy?
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:50:55
Yeah the whole Revolut thing is looking more and more scammy as I dive into it. £6.99 per month to 'unlock' crypto currencies... hmmmmmmmm

Someone mined 7,500 bitcoin on a dell laptop... hmmmm
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:43:13
I'm guessing you just made an insane amount of money

Man... fuck this guy

There was a tutorial post a while ago about a guy who turned one into a solo mining rig with a light that either flashed red or green every time a block is mined. As much as he never expects it to flash green, there's always a chance that the little pi could guess the right number and net you some $$$

Great band
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:37:26
So many times I've been tempted to post this answer in that group. Always wondered how it would go down
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:06:06
Can someone explain how the price increase since *date* is higher than the current rate?
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:56:53
It will matter one way or the other
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:08:20
Alt coin = Alternative coin i.e not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:15:30
Limited time frame anyway, just figured I'd throw something out there incase anyone was interested 
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:40:10
Can't read it if it's that way around, I know it should be behind but I think the meaning is implied

A few years ago, a relatively unknown team won the premiere league in the UK. 
Last year, the eagles won the Super Bowl. I personally know someone who bet on that at 45/1 and it came in. 
Past performance doesn’t determine future results.
So yeah, this year sucked... next year might not
Or it might, no one knows
