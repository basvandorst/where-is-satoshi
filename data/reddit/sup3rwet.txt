Monero to btc and vice versa will offer more privacy due to the layer of complexity you add, making it more annoying and time/money consuming to try to track you. 
If you want to be anonymous. Remember one word: layer

1)Just get a btcc account. 
2)Transfer your cny fre to their platform.
3) On their platform, buy bitcoin. It is very easy. 
4)Onc3 the bitcoins are confirm send then to your hot wallet. ( electrum for pc, mycelium for android or breadwallet for ios) wait for confirmation.
5) get a bitstamp account
6) send bitcoins from hot wallet to bitstamp.
7) exchange btc to usd.
8) wire usd to usa bank account

It was a plain paper. No stamp ,anyone could have printed it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:06:32
Well you have to put your mindset differently. It is a numbers game. Let say you win 60% of the trade, that is me being kind. In 10 trades you would have made (6*400)-(4*350)=1000 profit. Woohoo great week. Now let say it is notyour week, 40% win trade. You lose 500... I use fibonnaci 38%/168%. And this force you to enter your trade in a much better moment. Force you to be patient. Force you to be in a trade you like and force you ride the trend better.

RISK!! Also I like SALT, but from a speculative point of view. I don't understand why hold their coin. There is no incentives to hold it. And SALT can manipulate the active supply, because they are and continually will be the biggest holder. They can choose how many SALT they release on exchanges.

You could do it better by using TAILS as usb stick, it as a electrum build in. But here is my biggest concern in your approach. UBUNTU usb stick is not encrypted and probably neither is your PDF in the usb, you lose your usb = you lose your btc, because someone can go through your files and see the pdf.

 - but always double check if it is correct. Just download the paper wallet app to creatr paper wallet. Or create it with electrum with 13 mnemonic words. Electrum is already on the usb live. If being paranoid, your printer keeps the data from what you print in cache. You should empty that too.

@_date: 2016-07-02 11:39:23


Good luck With that. On the moment you send your money to POLO, you actually agree that you forfeited your money to that institution. Now to make even more interesting. If they can prove they haven't receive it...Well it is basically your fault and no court in the world will rule in your favor.
My advice. I also had a problem with POLO once. I sent an email on the support desk. It took so long for them to answer, that the small problem fixed itself. They support is terrible. Just keep your cool and try to solve it like gentlemen. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:37:55
Here is something to remember with taking risk. If the risk reward ratio is to high, don't do it. If your pay is too small but you are risking your name. You can get screwed if they run away with big settlement and the other party will look for legal ways to get to them through your name... But if you get lots of money so you can move to japan if there is a problem... DO IT. :)

So agree. I end up positive. it has been 9 months. But the thought that my coins are stuck for 12 months is annoying.

I see what you are trying. Finding a way to not pay the high fees.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:48:59
so true
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:44:36
if only they would fix their payment system.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:56:10
No problem. I am not a fan of snake oil anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:46:30
Their payment system is horrible.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:14:21
You are not real, this is a joke...how old do you think most proffessional btc miners are? Or even core devs. Your ignorance on this topic makes me even want to be even further away from dash, if people like you invest in it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:21:19
oh please no, you scare me. I will not cross the street either... It may be illegal in the US.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:19:31
Depends where you are from. 
Gemini, bitstamp, bitpanda, kraken,...

Coinbase is really losing clients... Switch to others,bro.

thx, but i fear it just wishful thinking at this point. :)
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:56:01
Nice, you probably between 20-29 years old. What a messed up generation... Please just think about what you said and my comment. You are seriously lacking integrity. Good luck further with your writing endeavours. You will need it.
