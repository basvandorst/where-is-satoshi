Say "this is actually good news" and nobody bats an eye. Say "such wow" and tip some Doge and everybody loses their mind.

Agreed. Its low value combined with its light-hearted novelty make DOGE something that anyone can get involved in. BTC is still a little complicated for non-technical types to get into just for the hell of it, but DOGE is being given away in whole denominations on the reddits, at faucets, etc. It also feels to people who missed the boat on BTC like they're getting in at the ground floor.
Some growth in means to exchange DOGE for goods or services and hell, it might even hang around for a while.
Bottom line, people who may not have been game to dive into BTC due to the perceived volatility and technical barriers can get their hands on some DOGE  for no expense or effort and can familiarise themselves with the mechanics of cryptos which readies them for  involvement in the BTC community at a later date. Everybody wins.

Looks great.
From a security perspective, by using this program am I essentially offering access to ~~all my coins~~ edit: *all my coins on BTC-e* to the programmer? Following on from that, do we have people within the community with sufficient PY experience to confirm the code is safe to use?

it has been talked about, on and off, over the past 10-15 years but nothing has actually happened as yet. fingers crossed it stays this way.
