They need to realise that their position comes with a man-sized helping of responsibility; a responsibility that they are failing to take seriously.

I have bought small amounts of bitcoin in the UK. I used bank transfers on Bittylicious and Localbitcoins, and both were quick and much easier than using a full trading exchange. You are looking for very small amounts so a bitcoin meet-up might be easier than an on-line purchase where minimum amounts are often required.

Pompous politicians can bluster all they like, there is nothing they can do, they don't have the ability to regulate Bitcoin, only to force it underground. They can however, put any squeeze they like on the interface between bitcoin and their fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:35:40
If you use the weighted volume of transactions. 
In a simple scenario when an exchange A, quoting a price of X, accounts for 70% of the total transaction volume and an exchange B, quoting price Y, accounts for the other 30%:
Weighted average price = X *  0.7 + Y * 0.3
Magic the Gathering of Incompetents are currently not converting bitcoins to fiat, any exchanges between the two are virtual and happen behind a wall of obscurity, isolated from the Economy at large. As a result the volume (% of transactions) at Gox is, to all intents and proposes, zero.
So our calculation becomes
price = X *  0.7 + Y * 0.3 + MtGox * 0
An exchange not carrying out real transactions carries no weight and can, and should, be ignored.

I have bought bitcoin on Localbitcoin several times, always by bank transfer. The only problem I ever had was when my bank's automatic fraud detection system put a hold on a payment. Otherwise it has always been quick and smooth.
If you're nervous, and who wouldn't be their first time, make a small purchase and if it goes OK, use the same seller to buy what you want.
Incidentally if banks are so secure why do they need o do that?

IIRC correctly the best mining GPU runs at 0.7GH/s, and costs around £700. Three USB block eruptors will set you back ~£150, add a powered USB hub  for £20 and a Raspberry Pi for £30 to get a full independent rig capable of 1GH/s for a total of £200 - a fraction of the price of the card alone.

The UK has a long standing tradition of using the phrase "self-regulation" to mean "we will do what the hell we like"
Nearly every bank has been miss-selling financial products, most recently payments protection insurance, as well as filing fictional transactions to manipulate the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). Those are just the two first things that came to mind, there are plenty of other examples to be had.
Most tabloid newspapers have been breaking the law with impunity in regard to phone and computer hacking.
Both these industries are self-regulated, self regulation is worse than no regulation at all. Transparency is the only solution.

The biggest advantage goes to the seller, they don't have to pay 3 or more percent to the credit card company, and they don't risk the charge-backs that credit card transactions might impose. How does that benefit you as a buyer, well at the moment it doesn't benefit you much, although I have managed to get free delivery on Bitcoin purchases that would have cost me extra had I used a card.
As Bitcoin gains wider acceptance you might see more incentives to use it over your credit card.

This is just FUD by an institution with a multi-billion dollar stake in the status quo. Bitcoins are more traceable than gold, diamonds, or indeed cash. Tracing a bitcoin transaction just requires software and internet access.

My godson has a bitcoin framed on his wall, he's 1 year old. His dad obviously has the private keys. Decorative value is subjective. Historic value, well, some would argue that bitcoin is an important development in computer science, and therefore historic.
Anything else?

It is an insurance company's core business to maximise premiums and minimise payouts. I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope, there is too much wiggle room for them, however in the USA the recent IRS decision to class Bitcoin as property may give you a footing.

Judge for yourself, there's a transcript:
DURATION: 02:52
Good morning. 
As everyone knows, this year marks the centenary of the start of the First World War. What is less noted is another anniversary: 1914 was the year when Germany began the world’s slow disengagement from the gold standard. 
Much less interesting, I hear you say; and of course you are right. But the First World War ended, while the post gold-standard economy still rules our lives. The supply of money, no longer stifled by a fixed exchange rate with gold, can be anything our governments and the bankers wish it to be. 
Whether this is to blame for the recent economic tempests is a question that is beyond me. My point is rather different. Once money was measured in gold and silver coins, sanctioned by religion and natural scarcity. By leaving that behind, we are holding our wealth in a strange environment where money is only what we trust it to be. 
In a way it’s impressive that mutual human trust allows us to hold our life savings in pieces of paper. 
But how far can the process be pushed, given what we know of human nature? Take, for instance, the strange world of bitcoins. For the past five years this entirely virtual currency has prospered mightily in cyberspace, and is now worth nearly ten billion pounds. No national bank controls it: bitcoins are created regularly by the software itself, and transactions are made secure by a system of passwords and secret keys. 
So a bitcoin is not a coin: its value is entirely based on what it is believed to be worth. And that belief is volatile. Yesterday the failed Mount Gox bitcoin exchange, which capsized along with seven percent of the world’s bitcoins, restarted its website. Users can look into their bitcoin wallets to check their balances, but, tantalizingly, they can withdraw nothing. Is their money real, or is it not? 
It’s fascinating to read the quasi-theological language of some bitcoin discussion groups. Here is a new religion, it seems. It has its rituals, or protocols. Its founder has mysteriously disappeared. Its software is unseen yet powerful; and its will is inscrutable, as shown in the sudden falls and spikes in the bitcoin price. It will free us from the ever-unpopular banks. As one blogger writes: it is a revolutionary religion that will save the world. 
Perhaps when we lose confidence in traditional religion, as many did after the Great War, we instinctively look for surrogates. The web has become a kind of mystical, metaphysical space. But should we place our trust in it? The prophets of old warned us that not all idols look like statues. It is wiser to trust God, says the Qur’an, than to trust the works of our own cleverness.

I use this one 
with a Blockchain wallet for carrying loose change around, and it looks fine to me. It integrates with the phone's wallet hub and 2FA is provided by the wallet supplier (Blockchain or Coinbase). I guess this is the one that steveme71 mentions.
There is a Kraken app available that I have never looked at.

It seems that the fault is a design flaw in the protocol. Other exchanges have stated that they had to implement a workaround so that the txId wasn't used until the transaction had entered the ledger.
I write software for a living and I understand the pain all too well, but MtGox still don't have a leg to stand on in this debate. It still comes down to laziness, poor testing and a cowboy's attitude to other people's money.

As an alternative to the ever more intrusive and frequently misleading or dangerous adverts that we get in web pages, I do think this is a pretty good idea.
Economic viability is another question. Acceptance would be a major deciding factor in its viability so we have yet another chicken / egg deal.

I felt much the same, but then I looked closer:
**public static function** I'm not sure if he knows another way to execute logic, and it kind of makes a mockery of SOLID design.
EDIT: I girded myself to look over more of it and the smell became both overpowering and familiar. the problem is this...
This code was written in Object Oriented (OO) PHP by someone who learned PHP long before OO was grafted onto the language. MK, if as seems to be the popular opinion, this is his code, wouldn't know object oriented design if it stole his cold coffee. All these public functions require global variables so it isn't even a good functional design. It must be impossible to analyse state in anything but the simplest of use cases.
As a developer I wince at the whole debacle. It is easy to imagine how the situation arose, pressure and inexperience, but you need to include some real personality issues to get into quite such a mess. The thought that anyone could publish **that code** and sleep at night is beyond me.

I read enough of the source code to know that if I was asked to review it I would throw it straight back; amateur hour at its worst, but no-one should be surprised by this. We knew Empty Gox's code was a bag of shit, purely by external observation, no-one needed source code to tell us what we already knew.
