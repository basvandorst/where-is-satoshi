FINCEN regulations require all users to have identity verified before transfering USD into BTC, etc on exchanges.  The coins can then be tracked simply on the blockchain to have evidence of where they went.  But if you simply change blockchains to say POTcoin at a exchange like Cryptorush with no FINCEN verification or tracking involved that money for users and dispensaries can be used without any worries.

Thank you for this post. Thank You for putting thoughts that clearly tie all the troubles for bitcoin together. It may not have been done specifically like this by me but the past week I have sensed that regardless of the outcomes of certain events bitcoin is going to drop and stabilize around $300-400ish range. With most media reports focused completely on bitcoin how does this affect the alts, some of which to me, will be given an opportunity to emerge from this chaos as viable solutions to a p2p currency economy with better day 0 implementation of features and benefits?

Free markets are the most popular part of bitcoins popularity. . Being able to get funds exactly were u want them and see how they are used is vital to a bitcoin revolution.   Nonprofits and equally distributed agency problems solved via bitcoin are going to be the first killer apps in the space.  Off shoots of the technology in messaging, anonymity,  and derivatives including law,  rights, and  insurance in a viable future will round out the implications of this invention.

This doesn't really compute in the globally derived figures that p2p has access to so the terms I use to define that is Trade Synthesis Value.   Makes sense?

The fact is anyone who tests below a 60 or so on the ASVAB would never even be able to hold a job down at a McDonalds or other fast food place.  The fact that the armed services accept recruits with scores as low as in the 30s proves that the military is basically just another social program.

Alt coins may be shit now but the usage in various cultures  or trade synthesized value applications the 8 billion or so individuals out there will each have their own twist on what they want from a p2p economic system and choose accordingly.

My biggest worrys are with enabling API since it seems that has resulted in compromises.  I didn't realize you could use coinbase as a exchange with order option either..

Right don't need to reinvent the wheel.  When major companies borrow the open source technologies, the information the masses gain, is one of acceptance and confidence.

For Bitcoin to have another massive speculation wave a few things could happen.  More gates for fiat to exchange, since many countries don't yet even have local exchanges for their fiat.

I am glad this information was released confirming the course they will follow because it has convinced me to get out for good before I have some bad experience as so many seem to have had.  And finally moving to bitcoin is not shifting from fiat, decentralized fiat is still fiat but much more dependant on major market providers like coinbase a legit value.  If the traditional banking vision is the first major hiring move they make even more so than customer service, you are asking for more of the same bankster behavior that broke our current fiat to the point of needing replacement.

The founder and the 2 recent hires are enough to ruin the good image Coinbase has in my eyes.  The confirmation that this company will be run as a traditional bank with fractional lending and money servicing is an easy sign to believe in better more out of the box type startups.  Combine that with the fact that they are charging 1% and price setting profits as an online startup with VC backing leaves alot more to be asked for in terms of culture towards users over there.

What I do have is the people's money, peer to peer trusted value currency, made possible by the power of a branch of math called cryptography.  You know, the kind of math that has won many of wars.  
The options of implementing this payment option to purchase your beef jerky are from what I hear, being provided for free at coinbase.com, and practical free at bitpay.com.  
I know you might not see this now, but I know that you will win alot more business selling jerky for bitcoin as soon as you followup with me and many others just like me, when that option for payment is avaliable.

So this is how long it takes to toss you a bone, not treating everyone as potential bankster and fraud right from the get go would be setting to high a standard right. Progress continues its slow march on at Coinbase. I made my decision about a week ago, no more Coinbase for me, and definitely don't want to turn people on to an experience that is just good some of the time. Enough scary times for now for all here in a Bitcoin world!!

Ride it cowboy.  I don't feel like staying in town if they give everybody strange looks and worry bout the business I might be doing.  Eat me a chicken dinner and ride on.
