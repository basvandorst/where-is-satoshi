Depends on your os, if [windows]( it probably just needs to be enabled. If Linux install miredo. 6to4 probably would need to be setup on your [router](
unless you have a static IP right on your computer.. But teredo works behind nat. 
You could also look at he.net [free tunnel broker service](

No. I mean maybe you could do it, but it wouldn't be useful for verifying transactions and the p2p protocol doesn't have any way for pruned nodes to request external  witness data. I don't think it would be useful to add the functionality. Just run a full node.

You should keep an offsite backup.

Most likely it will be sent back.

Easiest way would be to sell them to yourself I expect.

It doesn't remove fees. Essentially it bundles fees from many off-chain transactions into one higher on-chain fee to the miners. Some of the fees also go to the ln node operators to incentivize nodecount.

I mean sell it to you personally. Then you can sell it on an exchange to get your money back.

It sounds like you're not planning to pay tax owed to the IRS.. That may be a FEMA violation, whatever that is. Most likely you'll get away with it I imagine.

They are stored by the parties involved. They can store it however they like.. Stone tablets are OK.

You could do it by making a new hardfork that copied all balances from both chains.. Either you could double the total number of coins, or you could devalue everyone's balance in half so that both chains fit inside the original coin limit.. Also this way anyone who still had unmoved coins that were on both forks now again still has their original balance...

No. It is a tx malleability fix which is required for ln. In theory it might be possible to do ln without it but its cleaner this way. The 2x block size increase is a clever hack that was added because it was easy to do along with the malleability fix.
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:55:55
Are there really?
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:42:30
They didn't increase the block size, but their pow algorithm targets 2.5 minute blocks instead of 10min ones, so in the time bitcoin makes 1 x 1mb block litecoin can make 4 x 1mb blocks. Litecoin blocks are frequently empty (other than the coinbase) so I'm not sure it proves much about anything right now.

Good point.
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:47:17
Hasn't been a problem so far.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:29:57
Does ipv6 6to4 or teredo work?
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:27:17
Probably it being already in your name helps here. If it were inheritance then there could be inheritance tax, but technically it isnt as you already own the house.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:08:47
Maybe bitstamp.net or possibly gatecoin.net or okcoin.com or huobi.com
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:46:40
Once it fails maybe..

No. Segwit stops the transaction ids from being malleable. With bitcoin right now the signatures are considered when calculating the transaction Id the problem with that is that you can modify the signatures (mallate them) in such a way that they are still valid for ecdsa but by changing them it alters the txid. So now you have two (or more) txids for the same transaction. That's bad. You want a txid to correctly identify a transaction. You do not want the txid to randomly change if someone intercepts it before it gets mined, mallates it and then gets it mined under a new txid. Segwit fixes this by removing the signatures from consideration on the txid calculation so you can have a stable txid. Since the signatures had to be moved so this could be done in a backward compatible way it was easy to use the additional space in the old location for more transactions.

Realistically most bitcoin transactions are going between exchanges like coinbase and kraken and possibly merchant processors like bitpay. These can all be replaced by a douzen or so payment channels.
Your point is valid, but the structure of the ecosystem makes it largely irrelevant.. Although we preach hold your own keys, most people are not doing it .

It happens, but mostly to sellers (people receiving money into their accounts). It probably isn't a huge risk, but it definitely has happened. I would recommend opening an account with revolut.com, fire.com or fidorbank.UK and funneling the money through there. The main reason is that there aren't really many people trading in GBP so its better to use EUR on an EUR exchange. Those banks are good for making cheap fx and sepa EUR transactions. Its cheaper than buying on GBP exchanges and I guess it also keeps bitcoin away from your main account

No stopping, just mocking.
