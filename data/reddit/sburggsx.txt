What does the screen show?

That sounds so much better.  I just made a paper wallet to give to my brother for Christmas with 33,680 satoshis in it. I was even nice enough to do it during the dip!

Hopefully you’ve already tranferred the coins. I was working on something similar for my brother for fun, unfortunately the dip has caused transfers to cost most than what I was going to put on the wallets. 
Oh and you’re supposed to cut to the front lines and not the back ones. ;)

Google bitcoin paper wallet. It’s a web page that’s also a downloadable, stand alone page you can run offline for safety.

This was a great review, and it definitely helped me out when I received my new device. 
One thing I don't think is made clear in the review or on the product web site is the way backups/restores are handled. Yes it is all through the SD card and with passwords. However, it doesn't seem to restore the old wallet as a whole. It adds the old addresses to the newly created one. You cannot take a new Bitbox or a freshly reset on and get it back to what you had. I wish this was made more clear. 
Also, all ETH ability is done through myetherwallet. There is no visibility to ETH in the desktop app. This means you have to pull up a web site and type in your secure password for almost everything you do with ETH. I found this to be a bit of a letdown.

Nice write up. Clear and concise. Two things to note. First off the private key. Even if you click the view button on MEW, it doesn't show anything. If you try to print a paper wallet, same thing. No private key. Second thing is you didn't mention anything about the backup and restore process. I found this funky enough that everyone should try it to be sure they're comfortable.

10% isn’t bad. One near my house, that I just found, charges 12.5%. But I can also walk in with a $5 and a paper wallet and walk out 2 mins later with $4.35 worth of bitcoin. 
Let’s compare that to my Coinbase account that’s linked directly to a checking account. If I start a $10 transfer on Saturday, I will be lucky to have that $10 available to buy crypto the following Saturday. Yes 7 full days. Then after purchase fees and transfer fees to get it into a wallet I control, I’ve probably lost 10% anyway. 
Bitcoin ATMs might seem like a ripoff, but they are a huge step to mainstream adoption.

Tell your roommate to stop charging their phone then. That probably takes more power than a bunch of RPIs idling.

They specifically mention deposits. Does this infer that withdrawals are part of it too?
