21 million and 8 decimal points was carefully chosen because of amount of precision available in double-precision floating point. Even though integer numbers of satoshis should always be used when dealing with Bitcoin, Satoshi knew that at some point people would screw up and do math in floating point at some point, so this would prevent issues due to loss of precision.
A good explanation is in this article (by none other than Vitalik Buterin)

I was thinking earlier of a way to protect a regular HTTP domain from having arbitrary payment screens injected. So, as an attacker, I would register my own HTTPS payment site and randomly redirect other HTTP links through it before sending people back to their original location.
So really then full HTTPS is the only way... not only for the SWM process itself, but also for the preceding page with the link going to the payment flow. Or maybe require that the HTTPS domain that you are redirected to for payment is the same as the previous domain of the page.


OK, yes, I think you are right about this. I still wish the Accept header got more use though... :/

How about this one then? The original chart is not wrong. There has been tons of inflation since getting off the gold standard.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:24:57
Some things you may want to think about (sorry, this got long):
- As stated earlier, MD5 is broken/old, for a new protocol you should be using sha256.
- Since this is for payments, you can't use HTTP, only HTTPS. Otherwise anyone could easily MITM and put up a payment gateway to regular HTTP content, even without the site owner's permission i.e. in a coffee shop. Or just change the destination BTC address and steal the funds from a normal request.
- In addition, there needs to be an out-of-band way of verifying which domains are authorized to take payments, so I can't take a normal  then redirect to my own  then back to the original content. Something like a [CORS]( for site payment gateways.
- I'm not such a huge fan of having most of the setup be in the headers, I would personally prefer a custom mime-type to return the whole JSON object. This is for a few reasons:
  - There shouldn't be an HTML response page for needing payment, it should happen with a plugin or similar IMO. Easier to make consistent from the UI side.
  - Some proxies strip or abuse HTTP headers.
  - Harder to integrate into a web framework using headers, whereas a 402 page for payment is pretty straightforward. (IMO, for more adoption...)
  - Also some servers have limits on the size of headers, so if the base64 JSON ticket is bigger than 4K/8K you may run into problems.
- X-SWM-Object vs Ticket, pick a name and stick with it. If you want to use the term 'ticket', then call it X-SWM-Ticket, makes it a bit clearer IMO.
- What happens when the server is not ready before the client sends the request at the URL? or does the client just refresh forever I guess... getting 404s? more 402s?
Also, I'm sure you did your research, but these go over some of the pitfalls as well...

At this point, the only way Segwit2x won't happen, is if Core merges in a 2x patch themselves and wins the miners over.

@_date: 2017-08-08 07:01:11


Of course not. Who would run software that is not released yet, much less mine with it?


So the two network transit times would ~double the average effective latency seen for block propagation between btc1 and core nodes? Isn't increased latency one of the huge arguments that was used against raising the block size? And this additional node would be an old 0.14.3 release, whose numbers slowly decrease as people upgrade?


It would only be disruption AFTER a fork though, where everyone expects it. Not BEFORE the fork. 


Why couldn't Core implement replay protection as well? Then you can still be safe when people want to use the old chain after it loses 95% hashpower. Anyways, it does look good for something like [Gavin's patch for replay protection]( [petertodd's mailing list discussion]( on btc1.


But this time it is the opposite - S2X will have the hashpower, Core will not. So if Core wants to remain viable, it will be the one that needs to start defending itself... This is a shitty situation, but I don't see any other way out of it! Are you prepared to wave the flag for 6 months until a difficulty change? Merchants and users will not have time for 2 hour blocks (assuming 8% hashpower,) the old chain will look exactly like BCH!
Anyways, I think you guys can come up with a better way to gradually partition the network... As it is I think this might end up as a pretty big disincentive for Core miners to keep mining before the fork depending on how much uptake you get with 0.15.0...
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:26:52
Can you point me to *any* developer saying that they would want a PoW change in another hard fork?
I can only see Luke-Jr advocating for it, and Peter Todd advocating 'researching' it. Everyone else seems to think that a PoW change would be even more controversial than the block size increase!
The Segwit2x initiative will forcibly upgrade Bitcoin by *seizing the entire network*, starving out non-2x miners by forcing them to mine at a loss for months. Not just a community disruption, but a *complete takeover*. But at this point both sides are too entrenched to settle it any other way.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:36:58
Ok, I see. Yes, if a UASF node sees a non-Segwit block at this point it would fork itself off. Smells like a bug...

"Over time [Satoshi] trusted my judgment on the code I wrote. And eventually, he pulled a fast one on me because he asked me if it’d be OK if he put my email address on the bitcoin homepage, and I said yes, not realizing that when he put my email address there, he’d take his away. I was the person everyone would email when they wanted to know about bitcoin. Satoshi started stepping back as leader of project and pushing me forward as the leader of the project."
[A quote from Gavin]( in an interview. Maybe not super official, but the intent is clear.


Were you around for the past couple of years, through Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited? It is clear that the miners only wanted a block size increase. They did not want anything to do with SegWit ever. Only through Segwit2x and the NYA could Segwit be activated before the activation timeout in November, meaning a new code release to re-try activation at a later point.
Read [Mike's exit]( for a good summary of the issues people had with Core.


Yes, he can and will. Why do you assume a large signatory group of miners and economic players will just throw their hands up and give up? They see a way forward, if it doesn't happen with Core than so be it. It sucks but that's how it is. With 90-95% of mining hashpower you can completely control the Bitcoin chain. I don't think miners are that stupid to abuse it, but they definitely feel that Core is holding progress back of the network.

This hack requires you to install a hacked firmware on your device. If you or some gov't agent isn't installing hacked firmware, you are OK.
Otherwise, ***update your Trezor to 1.5.2 per the security update on their site, just to be safe.***
I initially thought it was a scam, and the site looks very scammy, but after looking at the code, and Trezor's warning, the attack looks real. If an attacker can load unsigned firmware without causing a successful wipe, then the mnemonic seed is truly loaded from storage in cleartext!!!
This seems to me like a huge security oversight... But it is really hard to prevent... As any on-device key could be extracted or cracked using a PC (since a PC would be 1000x faster, it could brute force all PINs.) The only real way to prevent is to hope that an evil firmware image is never loaded.
Alternatively, ***use a passphrase with your 24 word seed***. This gives you an effective additional layer of security.

The "limited time period" will be *months* with 90% hash rate leaving. If miners need profits to stay in business, the old chain could completely die out before a difficulty adjustment is reached.
And Core is very very against doing another hard fork PoW change, making Bitcoin into an altcoin.

Core cannot change any of the existing consensus rules without another hardfork itself, which is not their goal. So it is pretty straightforward to see what will happen...
- 80% hashrate drop = 10 minute blocks turn into 50 minute blocks.
- 50 minute blocks, means 70 days for a 2016-block difficulty retarget.
- Say this hashrate drop occurs in the middle of the retargeting period (which it just might), so then slow blocks for 35 days, after which the difficulty will be 60%, average of 100% and 20% difficulties. 
- Now blocks are 30 minutes long for another 42 days.
Maybe a long 2 month slog, but not so onerous.
Now... what about 90%? 10 mins =&gt; 100 minutes. That's a long time for merchants to wait for that critical first confirmation to take place. If it occurs halfway through, that's 2 1/2 months to wait for the first adjustment, after which difficulty is 55% of original, meaning blocks are now 55 minutes long, another 2 1/2 months until the next difficulty adjustment. That would be a looooong 5 months, at this point confirmations go back to normal, but it is April.
This doesn't even look at what might happen if the price drops and miners just stop mining at a loss... these delays could go on forever. Or look at the possibility of attacking the minority hashpower chain. Might some zero-confirmation services pop up to keep the economy functional? Maybe... but that much majority of the hash rate leaving can be a pretty powerful stick.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:34:59
Thanks for the level-headed replies.


Some excellent developers have already left Bitcoin itself since it was too hostile. So if more leave, then that will be unfortunate. I do believe lots will still want to develop on the Bitcoin chain, even as the 2x chain. Especially so if Segwit2x is successful and there is limited disruption. Even so, btc1 will just merge improvements from Core like they have been doing so contributors could develop for either if they were still interested.


Arguably this is already the case... How many nodes do you think would it take to stop Segwit2x from happening? Not too many nodes are really needed for a healthy propagation of blocks and transactions.


At least BitPay already supports Segwit2x. Having blocks being 100% full for months, increasing uncertainty on transaction confirmations, that is NOT good for Bitcoin adoption. A chain that can be attacked so easily for so long is detrimental to Bitcoin's use for payments. Many shops who would _want_ to take Bitcoin have dropped the payment button because it is now too much friction for users to wait hours for confirms. Until a LN solution gets here, a block size increase is our only real shot.
I guess my real question is, what can Core do about this? Surely a large % of hashpower will go along with 2x, according to even the original HK agreement, not to mention the NYA. I think there is real inertia there and it can't just be ignored. Miners are fed up, and they have a win from activating Segwit before the UASF date, showing they can work together to make things happen quickly.
Does Core have any options but to sit by and watch the coup happen?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:48:16
But at that point Core has already lost the whole network to Segwit2x. This would mean merchants, exchanges, etc. are unlikely to support the original Bitcoin... there will be a LOT of pressure on Core devs to roll with the change and just support it if the fork happens somewhat smoothly (as it would with 90%+ hashpower...)
Major current economic players have already signed up for Segwit2x, like Coinbase and Bitpay. So there will already be some big players on both sides.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:13:25
Do you know what the [FIBRE network]( is? Read what steps they take to shave milliseconds off the block relay time. Why bother with this if the milliseconds don't matter?
Are you saying that adding another hop makes it faster? Anyways, we will see when Segwit activates what the propagation of larger blocks looks like.

Just the fact that the 1MB blocksize CAN be easily spammed/attacked for a long period of time is a good reason to raise it to 2 MB.
Spamming transactions to push fees higher should have much more serious financial penalties.

Come on, you can't really think this? This is a straight up insult to those who have spent years of development effort to push Bitcoin forward and make it into the global currency it is today. I don't know if you were in Bitcoin around 2011-2013, Gavin and Mike were probably the most instrumental in being the 'public face' of Bitcoin, evangelizing pretty much every chance they got. Gavin was even blessed by Satoshi to take over!


Tell me this then, what *does* happen when all the blocks start getting rejected? The peer sending the 'invalid' blocks gets banned by the node, and eventually the  network self-heals into '2MB' node partition and a '1MB' node partition. This is exactly what happened with Bitcoin Cash, eventually the network sorted itself out after a couple dozen blocks. Also, now that we know what happened with BCH, there are more advanced protections put into place that make the partitioning happen faster. If you run the 0.15.0 release of Core you may not ever see any 2MB blocks relayed, since it disconnects any 2X client that connects.
It's actually not a bad thing to have blocks be rejected, just slows the network down a bit until your node finds whatever side it can get consensus with.


I think that they will start accepting other altcoins way before this happens. There are many good options for settlement available now. It used to be just Bitcoin, now it's 'use shapeshift or changelly and do whatever works best.' They have no obligation to support Bitcoin, they just want something simple that works.


And you don't see this attack as a problem that a 2MB block size would make twice as hard to pull off? The possibility of a transaction stalling for hours is *death* to online businesses. Angry customers that have a bad experience using Bitcoin is not good for adoption.


We will see what miners choose to do... it will be a long slog on the original chain, months and months to reach a difficulty adjustment, wide open to attack by other miners at any moment. Possibly exchanges won't touch the original chain without replay protection (as with BTU,) so it can't find a market price, meaning mining the old chain may not ever pay off...


No, this is pretty clear. It is forcibly taking control away from Core, since they have been stalling this upgrade for so long. If Core added a patch in to be compatible, I guarantee miners would go for it. They have literally been asking for exactly what Segwit2x now offers for a year and a half. We will see what happens come November.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:21:09
No, this can't happen anymore. LOCKED_IN state always goes to ACTIVE, there is no threshold anymore. The delay is just a cooling off period to make sure nodes can plan for the new rules.
From BIP 9:


Also, I believe both BIP 148 and BIP 91 nodes handle the LOCKED_IN state correctly, where they will accept even non-signalling blocks as it will already activate. They have already done their job.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:58:39


This impact:
One of the biggest arguments against increasing the block size was the increased latency it would take blocks to be broadcast around the network due to bandwidth constraints, increasing the centralization effect of mining in different regions. 
By adding this change, forcing blocks to go through 2 hops to get from btc1 nodes to core nodes, then wouldn't the same argument apply? So then this patch results in increased centralization pressure on mining if a majority of mining nodes start running the btc1 client.
Or are mining nodes expected to run 0.14.3?


Sure, because Bcash nodes ignored/removed the selection logic, instead of using it to their advantage. Though in their case also there was not a lot of time to bootstrap a fully redundant network of ABC nodes and gradually partition.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:08:36
Just to answer, no, the difficulty level stays fixed for a certain duration (2016 blocks.) So you would be mining at the same original difficulty level that everyone else was at, for a very very long time until the adjustment kicks in.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:38:46


I just think disconnecting other nodes is a bit too harsh. Why not do it similar to using your existing logic that preferred Witness nodes? This seems like a much softer way to partition than just dropping connections. Then as the fork nears, it can gradually get more restrictive. This would decrease any impact a lot...
This seemed to work a bit TOO well early on to partition the network, with things like this   happening.

@_date: 2017-08-08 06:15:39
Seems like this change will just centralize the mining to only btc1 miners even *before the fork*, as they will partition and share the highest difficulty chain amongst themselves, only trickling down this chain to Core nodes through old nodes.
This would present a huge disadvantage to miners trying to mine using the Core client, as the block relaying would be much slower, through older 0.14.3 nodes only.
The network will self-heal after a partition, it may be nasty for a bit while nodes reject blocks and ban each other, but I would think that would be preferable to changing the fairness and game-theory incentives of mining before the fork even happens.
This seems like a purely politically-motivated change by Core that might really backfire...

I think the 1 MB limit was always intended to be just an anti-spam measure, and 2MB is very reasonable when REAL transactions are being affected. There has been quite a bit of game-theory like analysis on the effects of a larger block size, like 8 MB, but I believe 2 MB is not so different in terms of network performance.
The problem is that the technically better (and well-proven) scaling solution is waiting to get implemented first, even though in my opinion both should happen ASAP.

It's an good article in the sense that it forces people to think about the long-term future of what they think Bitcoin should look like. I suggest everyone in this sub read it, for a taste of the 'big block vision,' surely you can keep an open mind for a few minutes... Trigger warning: the article leans anti-Segwit and pro-Bitcoin Cash. 
Some key tl;dr points...


Lays out the bias...




More anti-Segwit sentiment...


Things like this come off very anti-Segwit, with some semi-founded appeals to authority.
Also, the article forgets that splitting the network is VERY bad for Bitcoin, and with some ideas that I personally don't agree with...


Who sets this adjustment process? Why wouldn't the miners collude to keep the blocks full and the transaction fees high? Bitcoin has never had a 'block size limit' knob before. It was always a hardcoded 'anti-spam' limit, adjusted manually for demand.


Sharding kinda counteracts the idea of having a decentralized network, where you only need a single node to see if coins are valid.


Wait, big blockers haven't tried Segwit either... so why even bother bringing up this point? Very anti-Core sentiment.


And some unsupported claims, just wanted to call this out, as there are MANY parties against a split, especially a contentious one.
So, the article is just OK. It is always good to consider the other side's arguments, even if you don't agree. It *is* a nice thought experiment to consider what Bitcoin will be like a couple years down the road with possible 10x to 100x growth in transaction volume.
Would you still be able to transact on-chain with reasonable fee size? What would that mean for the blocksize or the network? Would blocks need to become 10x to 100x bigger as well to manage 'peer-to-peer' payments?
Or would there be Bitcoin banks to handle settlement in consolidated transactions, and offer debit-card like mechanisms for instant settlement in BTC to keep fees low, possibly based on the Lightning Network? Similar to the SWIFT or ACH networks today?
The one thing that the article doesn't get though, is that if Segwit2x goes smoothly, we can have BOTH the big block vision and the Segwit/innovation vision at the same time, right now (in November.) So we don't have to immediately see which one will 'win' in the marketplace. We can get a small taste of big blocks right now to fix some demand issues, and let the SegWit innovations keep on coming for the next couple years.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:32:02
The HF will happen. 90% of miners don't just change their mind arbitrarily. Especially since this gives them what they have been asking for from the beginning.
Without replay protection, the major exchanges will only support one chain. If 90% of miners are on the 2x chain, exchanges won't transact on the old chain, essentially killing it.
So either Core sucks it up and applies the 2x patches, or they get left behind as everyone moves to the btc1 project.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:45:59
Segwit brings a lot of additional complexity, and requires wallets and merchants to upgrade to use the new transaction formats to get any benefit. While it is well-tested and running smoothly on testnet and LTC so far, it is by no means 'backwards-compatible' except in the sense that if you don't want to use it you can still use the old tx format.
In contrast, the 2x part of segwit2x is much simpler, effectively a 1 line change. 1000000 -&gt; 2000000.
Unfortunately, once they are active, there is no turning back. Unless there is a major bug in Segwit, I don't see anyone agreeing to scale anything up OR down for the next few years at least.

I did back years ago, before the blockchain outgrew the hard disk I was using on my VPS. I am currently running a testnet5 node on a VPS to keep an eye on development.
Currently I don't have the bandwidth available for a proper setup, and VPSes with a large disk are harder to find; I haven't considered running a pruned node yet. For the record, I do plan on setting up some nodes on mainnet running Segwit2x once the code is released.
This is all very interesting btw, but I will probably need to go soon. If you'd like we can continue this line of questioning some other time.

There are &gt;1 mb tx available to mine here:    See the 'Save the Chain' transaction, which is too big to fit in current blocks, but would easily fit in a 2 MB block. The miner who mines it gets a bounty of 274 BTC. I guarantee you will have all miners lined up to try for that bonus the instant it becomes possible.
The fork WILL happen. There is no way you have 80%+ showing support and they all just magically go away, when they have been asking for this solution for a year and a half. This will happen even without good software, and with bugs. Such is the nature of the game, trying to hit the Aug 1 UASF timeline. But so far, the diffs are small, and pretty easily reviewable.
The software is open source, and anyone can review jgarzik's work and help with the testing. At any moment Core can apply the Segwit2x patches and solve the entire issue.

@_date: 2017-07-14 06:38:07
I don't think that UASF can actually get enough mining support to activate SegWit before it times out Nov 15.
So, first I'm going to assume that there are enough miners running Core (or btc1, come Aug 1) and that they will have enough nodes to support a healthy network after Aug 1, that there won't be enough UASF nodes rejecting their blocks. There doesn't need to be a lot of nodes on the network for good propagation to still happen, and in extreme cases miners will just block nodes supporting a UASF version after Aug 1, since they know that they will just reject their blocks anyways. If miners are running Core or btc1 software, then they will just continue building on the longest chain after the split Aug 1, regardless of the signaling. I'm also assuming they aren't manually controlling the chain the block goes into, or don't have the software expertise or motivation to modify the node to do this, or else they would just run a UASF node in the first place.
The split between UASF miners and non-UASF miners happens on the first non-Segwit-signalling block after Aug 1, as UASF nodes have to use the last Segwit block to mine on, whereas Core nodes will use either block. So I'm only going to look at it from a UASF hash rate side.
So the question is, how much hashpower will the UASF chain have to dedicate to a segwit-only chain? Is there enough hashpower to get Segwit activated before Nov 15, when SegWit activation itself times out and cannot activate without a software upgrade?
Let's do the math: you need 1916 Segwit-signalling blocks during a 2016 block retargeting period to get SegWit locked in.
So for this case let's assume a good, simple case for UASF, where it starts fresh at a new retarget on Aug 1. You have to mine 2016 blocks before Nov 15. You have 9,158,400 seconds, or 15,264 current difficulty average block times (9158400/600) to do it between Aug 1 and Nov 15. So this means you have to have 13% (2016/15264) of the hash power, otherwise SegWit cannot activate via UASF as it would time out.
Though, looks like if a retarget happens tomorrow, then there will be one more a couple days before Aug 1. If it happens more than 3 days before Aug 1, this is VERY bad for the UASF. This means &gt;100 blocks have not signalled SegWit (assuming 50% signalling rate,) so you will have to mine a whole other retargeting period to get it to lock in. This means, finishing out the first retarget of 2016 blocks, then doing a complete other 2016 blocks. For this to happen before Nov 15 would be (maybe 200 blocks have been mined already) 1816 + 2016 blocks, so you have to have 25% of the hashpower that exists right before Aug 1 to get it locked in before timeout.
Right now I counted 1 BIP148 block (per the coinbase text, from Bitcoin India) in the last day of blocks, so less than 1% explicit support. Could there be 10x more support somewhere for BIP148? Definitely possible, if people are planning to mine for the UASF they shouldn't bring their miners online to raise the difficulty level needlessly. But right now, it looks like there are not enough miners to get SegWit to activate with the UASF, even if you have the node count to support a Segwit-only network.

Just remember that if it is really 90% of the hashpower supporting Segwit2x, and still running it in November, your node will care, as it will not be on the same chain.
All the exchanges and wallets will be forced to support the 2x chain only (as there is not enough time to put in good replay protection,) and the 1MB chain will die, and everyone can move on, scaling completed, leaving your node behind.
Of course you can keep your node running at this point, but without any blocks you can't make any transactions, so you get stuck. At least you'd be HODLing forever...
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:31:01
They are only adding these extra bootstrap nodes, all the other Core bootstrap nodes are still in the list. It is quite difficult to pull off a sybil attack just using raw node counts.
And it would be VERY obvious if your chain starts to deviate from the main Bitcoin chain.

Yes, but if they play along, it can be done somewhat safely. If they merge the Segwit2x patches, then there will just need to be a big upgrade push and everything will go smoothly.

Haha, sorry, I mean someone who can clearly articulate their 'position', and act as a central rallying point for their 'cause.' sipa? theymos? or gmaxwell? but I don't know if they would take that role. I'm thinking someone like the position Gavin used to have years ago - developer, developer advocate, and evangelist.
In software development it is important to have some idea of a roadmap or idea of when things can get done. If there is a major bug like scalability outstanding, and developers are just independently replying 'LOL' to a compromise agreement by major players in the space who have their own multi-million dollar investments in keeping the network running, you can see how that might ruffle some feathers.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:12:34
OK, please explain then, I am not following.
Because there can be a hell of a lot of UASF nodes or Core nodes that are sitting around just rejecting every block that comes their way, if the rest of the network moves on after the HF. At that point those nodes become pretty much useless.
That's the whole point of Nakamoto consensus - the chain without the hashpower dies out.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:13:15
At the moment, Segwit2x count is very low since the software hasn't been officially released yet. Expect that to change in the next few days and weeks.
Just remember that node count only matters if they are doing useful work on the network - sending and receiving transactions, and relaying blocks. If there are enough Segwit2x nodes around on the HF time to relay blocks and send transactions to the miners, (and they can find each other... this is somewhat of a current issue...) they will be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:33:00
There WILL be a split. You think 90% of miners would signal and then ALL pull out? After getting what they have been asking a year and a half for?

Funny story, Bitcoin's core innovation was how to prevent users from having a say, considering it an avenue for attack, as it is VERY easy to create a bunch of 'users' out of thin air that agree with whatever you want.
This is why Bitcoin is based on Proof-of-Work and why it is a coordinated group of miners, exchanges, and developers, that control the network, and not users.
- Miners have the final say, since they create the blocks and give security to the chain.
- Exchanges can kill a whole fork effort on their refusal to support it (see Bitcoin Classic.)
- Developers can change the code to alter the behavior of the network, or create features.
But users can do nothing really... even with no users the chain keeps going (until the block reward runs out.) The only power the users have is to switch to another coin...

Sorry, care to present some more proof? Do you even know who Aran Aster is? I have no idea, and it claims to be a literal sockpuppet account, so I'll just take the arguments at face value...
Segwit2x's mission is very simple. It is only to honor the NYA, and provide a reference implementation of Segwit2x based on a fork of Bitcoin Core. Things like internationalization support, documentation, and support are literally out of scope. Since it has such a simple mission, it is definitely feasible for one developer to be able to maintain a fork. Especially once Segwit activates, the hard-fork code is very simple compared to getting the signalling transitions right for activating Segwit.
The code is pushed to a public repo on Github. Issues are discussed openly in the issue tracker. Code is run in testing on the separate 'testnet5' network, which is open to anyone who wants to run a node on it and contribute testing resources. Not sure how much more 'open' you want it to be? Unfortunately some of their internal processes remain closed (you can read the archives of the mailing list, not sure about the slack) but I can't entirely blame them as the whole community has become so toxic, and there are so many trolls everywhere, this can be tougher to manage in an open mailing list.
Though, I really hope Core comes to some consensus of what to do about the Segwit2x fork. It is not going away - almost all miners are still showing their support to switch to the fork, bugs or no, and this one is VERY clear that it will be a Hard Fork, not 'no its a coin split' like BIP148. As such, I would hope that they at least put out a statement or something, as ignoring it won't make it disappear. Maybe sometime in mid-August or September we will see...
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:46:50
Nodes define consensus through the blocks that they are willing to accept. If a miner mines a block against the rules set by the node, it gets rejected. This applies to both nodes run by miners and by users.
If the rules are changed, then some nodes will reject blocks that others consider valid, thus a 'fork' happening. The segwit2x nodes have a rule, basically 'accept 2MB blocks,' programmed in to happen at a specific time, and legacy Core nodes do not. Thus the 'hard fork' in November.
At this point, miners have a choice - which chain do they build blocks on? New rules or old rules? This depends on a huge amount of factors normally... lots of game theory... BUT at this point it is simpler since most mining power has already shown explicit support to switch to the segwit2x software - to build blocks on the segwit2x chain. Some other big players, like Coinbase or Bitpay have also agreed to run the segwit2x software.
What does this mean for blocks on the other side of the legacy/Core side of the fork, with the minority of hashing power?
- Slow transaction times (until the difficulty adjustment, but this might take weeks or months)
- Exchanges may not support it (exchanges have a tough time since the transactions themselves are valid on both of the chains, so you can deposit to an exchange, sell, withdraw, then say 'haha just kidding' and get all your coins back, essentially stealing from the exchange)
- The minority chain can be prone to attack, since it is obvious that there is more hashpower on the other chain to perform the work. These would be things like wiping out transactions and miner rewards at any time, or performing double spend attacks. 
So there are lots of reasons why the minority chain might not be successful.
Unless there is a thing called 'replay protection' added - this ensures that coins can only be on one chain or the other, and the wipeout risk doesn't happen. Then there is a space to 'let the market decide' and the two chains would co-exist, somewhat. This is the current situation between ETH and ETH Classic. However, currently on Bitcoin there is no such protection for the minority chain, and it is a bit more difficult to do in Bitcoin anyways, so the minority chain might just die out and be left with the majority segwit2x chain as "Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:28:40
Without replay protection, and with 90% of the hashpower going to Segwit2x, then exchanges will pretty much be forced to adopt Segwit2x as the main Bitcoin chain.
This is exactly why Bitcoin Unlimited died, since it was a minority split from the chain, and with no replay protection, exchanges can't really transact safely with it. 
The same thing would happen with the legacy 1MB chain.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:35:35
Segwit2x is the compromise... FTFY.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:47:27
No it's not.
- This one has overwhelming consensus from major economic players and miners in the space. None of the previous agreements had that. 
- There is a (former) Bitcoin Core dev leading the project. So it has some level of legitimacy.
- Also, the code is a straight fork of Core with simple, reviewable, HF code; not any extra baggage/nonsense like with Classic or Unlimited or ABC.
That's why the others have failed, and why this one will succeed.

He's saying we're going to pull a bait and switch on the miners, then laugh heartily while Bitcoin burns in two separate dumpster fires. (shh! secret!!!)
The only way back to the greener pastures is by having everything go smoothly with Segwit2x, both the Segwit part *and* the 2x part, and by having Core turn up their nose and apply the Segwit2x patches, thus ending the scaling debate once and for all.
Any other way would result in a split in Bitcoin, there might be an exodus out of Bitcoin for some other Coin, or even the abandonment of cryptocurrency as a serious investment vehicle for many years if it goes badly.

Just remember it has taken a year and a half to get to this point. Lots of people were burned by this debate. I don't think it will happen again anytime soon.
Also remember that the fork doesn't care about leaving you behind. If you aren't mining blocks or writing code, you don't get a say.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:09:09
If anything, it is the opposite? How can you argue that 80% of miners pre-signaling for the NYA agreement *in their blocks* is lack of support?! And so many major economic players?
We will see once btc1 gets released what will happen.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:37:25
They are the entire reason the debate has gone on for so long, and why jgarzik is doing all the development work himself, and why 90% of miners are signalling to stop using the Core client, and onto the btc1 client.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:20:07
I think that Core is just lacking a good leader. They themselves are too decentralized, which leads to no clear goals or roadmap and makes it look like they are stalling, when they really are just trying to be cautious and look out for what's best for the network. They had great leadership with Gavin during over the last couple of years, but I can imagine it is hard to keep such a diverse group together, and Bitcoin grew way too fast for just a couple of people to manage it.
Unfortunately though, it looks like this lack of leadership will cost them their influence on a large part of the network if they don't end up merging Segwit2x back into Core and solving the scaling debate once and for all.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:06:27
Consider investing in a hardware wallet - it's the safest place to store your Bitcoin, and there is very little risk that they would become unsupported someday.
And hey, if the split gets screwed up and Bitcoin dies, you can store other cryptocurrency there too!
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:14:47
Yes. Hopefully Core comes around and sees the network split and 90% of the hashpower going away, and major economic nodes running btc1, and comes to terms with the hard fork and applies the patches. Otherwise, btc1 will likely become the new reference client for Bitcoin.
If segwit gets activated, a lot of the complexity in btc1 goes away, since a lot of code was there to make sure signalling happens correctly, so then the code to apply to Core is just
    if (blocknumber &gt; X)
        maxblocksize = largerlimit
[shamelessly copied out of Satoshi's original vision for changing the blocksize]( The whole thread is interesting too... in a lovely ironic twist, even the same jgarzik is spearheading the effort! Just 7 years later...
The centralization is still definitely an open issue... once Segwit happens I think it will be looked into very closely. I think it is not such a big deal personally... and there are technical ways to ensure decentralization is still fair, like the [FIBRE network](

In order to be accepted by governments and the existing financial system, Bitcoin itself will need to 'grow up.' This will mean audits, regulation, and government interference for tax reasons.
All of these MUST happen for any digital currency to be successful - it is so easy for a government to ban it by making it illegal to transfer in and out of fiat, thus destroying its use for normal people. Unfortunately, this means Bitcoin will have to succumb to government pressure to keep cryptocurrency alive.
Digital currency is still in its infancy, and still probably decades away from being integrated more widely into commerce. So this is a step it must go through to be accepted, to have a future where we can start having nice things like anonymity. Also, Bitcoin was NEVER meant to be an anonymous payment system, only pseudonymous.
Sorry if its a bit gloomy, but governments and banks have quite a bit of power. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:23:32
Currently, you are right, they ARE running Core. They have only signaled intent to run Segwit2x once the code is released. They are part of the 80% right now, but may not be next week.
I think the term 'economic majority' was created during the UASF/BIP148 period, since the way to win with a UASF is to get exchanges, merchants, etc. to run your node software. If they were to get a lot of players onboard to run BIP148, then there is an immense incentive for the miners to play along and get things going. Even though it looks like Segwit will happen *before* Aug 1, the threat of UASF was important to set a deadline for things to be in motion.
The 2x part of Segwit2x won't play out until mid-November though, when the HF deadline gets closer. Many things can change between now and then. If they still have an overwhelming majority of hashpower, then expect a lot of people to switch to the client that will go along with the HF.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:24:51
Yeah but remember, if Segwit2x really does have as much support as it looks like, and only 10% of hash power stays with the original chain after August, then Segwit2x *will become* Bitcoin after the HF. Exchanges will use it, wallets will use it, payment providers will use it.
If you still want to support the original chain then you are welcome to do so, but you'd better start buying ASICs and learning C++ as the rest of Bitcoin will be moving on.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:34:18
Right, I was discussing the hard fork part of Segwit2x only. 
Though comparing it to the UASF, the rules change is happening on the majority of hash power side, assuming current support. So things will turn out a bit differently.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:08:31
I really don't want the core devs to leave!!! I think it sucks that they are being forced into this position.
But I do think they need to accept that there is a huge investment component to Bitcoin, and without a 'leader' to fight for their position, by the power of decentralization they can die by their own hand having the network essentially stolen from them.
But, blocks will keep being mined, transactions will be made, Bitcoin will continue to march on...
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:22:27
See? Not very helpful.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:54:22
No... if it hit the current BIP91 adjustment period, or maybe even the next, it would be about the same. Miners are signalling SegWit early, as it is pretty obvious what BIP91 and BIP148 intends to accomplish, and miners don't want to get left out. The next batch of segwit blocks, used for the 95% test, doesn't start for a couple of days, and it's too late to lock in for the current one.
So this means segwit gets 'locked-in' 525 (until the next lock-in period starts) + 2016 blocks (for the BIP141 95% test) from now, and activates another 2016 blocks later, so lock-in around Early August, and active around late August.
Though, this assumes that miners don't pull out of the SegWit activation process, if nodes don't actually enforce the BIP91 or BIP148 support, and any major player dropping out could delay the timeline another 2 weeks at least.
So even though I was against running a BIP148 UASF node before, since BIP91 has been activated by the miners, you should run one now to increase pressure on the miners as it is the only client that will really enforce the rules (without segsignal.)
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:40:59
Yes, they will be rejected.
There will have to be an upgrade campaign if the economic majority wants to continue using the chain with the majority hashpower. We will see in September/October if this happens. 
So far though, some major 'economic majority' players, like Coinbase and Bitpay, have already signed up to use the segwit2x chain.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:18:43
Zaromet's talking about the 'Save the Chain' transaction: 
That can only be published (and thus the miner collects 274 BTC reward) when the block size is &gt; 1 MB.

Yes, you are definitely right - they are very fortunate to have the option of using Bitcoin at all, and the situation is pretty dire.
But I still find it fascinating that Bitcoin enables a black market to exist in the real world with some amounts of real settlement possibilities, and in a digital currency that is completely out of goverment influence.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:11:58
What happens when Coinbase starts trading China-coin as Bitcoin? Without any option to use the minority chain?
What if Core patches the Segwit2x code in, to try and avoid a contentious hard-fork, and preserve any influence they have on the main client people will run on the network?
Would it still not happen then?
If you knew how Bitcoin worked this is EXACTLY how a decentralized network works. An overwhelming majority of the miners and economic players have found a way to take the network into their own hands, and make upgrades without Core's oversight, since Core has stalled too long. It's just code after all. If people still want to transact with the majority fork then called 'Bitcoin', they can upgrade their node to do so to be in consensus with the new majority of the network. I am sure there will be tons of warnings in Sept/Oct/Nov to upgrade.
Segwit2x is not going away.

@_date: 2017-07-24 04:01:13


If there is an a semi-official statement from Core regarding this, not just a bunch of 'LOL', then please point me to it. Even a mailing list discussion somewhere...


A lot of people will be unhappy with transactions that take hours to confirm *for months on end* until a difficulty change. (seriously, if there is just 10% hashpower, the 2 week difficulty change at the split becomes 4 months...) Not to mention the huge fees on the legacy network in the meantime when transactions have to fight for 1/10 the blocks, and considering it is even an option that exchanges would support it.
This creates some serious pressure to move to the Segwit2x chain for real businesses that use BTC currently, come November...
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:06:20
Problem is, miners get to decide the rules. If they all start deploying Segwit2x, or the 80% hashpower support for the  compromise is accurate, then Core will have no choice but to go along with Segwit2x's hard fork so things don't get screwed up in September. At least they get SegWit!
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:40:59
No it won't. Exchanges will likely only support the chain with the massive amount of mining support, especially without replay protection... and it won't be the legacy 1MB+SW chain.
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:56:09
People may not like one part or the other of Segwit2x, but if they suck it up and agree to compromise it WILL be good for Bitcoin as it resolves many scaling issues immediately and many more in the future, without requiring massive changes to the core of Bitcoin.
Those who had the chance to persuade people over the last few years have run out of time and are now having their hands forced by the wider market that NEEDS Bitcoin to function smoothly at a low cost.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:20:02
Which part is wrong? What do you see happening if a majority of the hashpower adopts Segwit2x? I don't see Core taking the risk of splitting Bitcoin in two.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:17:21
Bitcoin has never failed at its core. There was never a chain split before that resulted in a minority chain more than a couple blocks long.
This is new territory for Bitcoin. If it splits badly, then it reverts back to a 'toy project' in most people's minds that is not ready for prime-time. This could take years or decades to restore trust again.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:37:06
Miners and users have literally been asking Core to do this safely for a year and a half now, and Core has done nothing but say "no way, SegWit first, then maybe we'll think about HF."
But SegWit doesn't scale immediately (needs updates to wallets to use new transaction formats,) and maybe doesn't even scale enough by itself. A HF to 2 MB, while more intrusive, does solve a lot of scaling problems immediately, and is more compatible with current wallets and software integration.
I had hoped for a nicer solution to scale from Core but unfortunately the time has run out, which is why miners, exchanges, and merchants are on track for Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:02:42
Well, when any developers release code they like to test it first. 
The btc1 project just dropped an alpha code base yesterday, miners are correct to want to wait until the code is solid before running it in production. But they still want to signal support somehow. We will see on Monday.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:59:01
I mean to say that Bitcoin itself doesn't care what the developers do, of course there are some amazing developers inside of Bitcoin that got us to this point, and great players in the market that have the long-term future of Bitcoin as the top priority.
But it doesn't change the fact that the code DOES play politics, since you can write code to do whatever you want. The ONLY thing that matters is consensus, which comes through hash power, according to the original rules of Bitcoin.
This is regardless of if that consensus is due to political compromises, or miner activated upgrades, or even UASF. Consensus backed by hash power is what matters, not code.

@_date: 2017-06-20 04:34:45
No, assuming Segwit2x goes well, this problem is solved for a few years at least. By then hopefully people will be using Lightning transactions more, and maybe we won't need to scale further than SW+2MB for decades.
There will probably always be discussion about auto-scaling the block size, but if this relatively simple change is any indication, those solutions will have a very tough time getting consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:46:19
Yes, those videos are great and aantonop is probably the best part of Bitcoin, an amazing promoter, he is of course exactly correct in how he describes nodes, and the partitioning that will happen during the HF between nodes that are/aren't using the Segwit2x rules.
Lightning will take a bit of time to get traction in my opinion. The foundations to put it in place will be there with Segwit, but LN itself will still need a lot of development and some more thinking around routing. Maybe around next year it will be more viable.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:00:19
China has the lowest cost of energy, the lowest cost to produce large-volume ASICs, low enough safety standards that they can run facilities dangerously but cheaply, and enough corruption to have officials 'look the other way' when needed. This is the perfect environment to have giant mining farms, or giant datacenters.
People miss this when they think a POW change will solve anything - maybe for a couple months, before everything starts to settle in China again. If you want a global currency, you have to accept the global political situation as well.

How do you know that the StatusQuo coins will be mined at a loss? You are assuming that, but in reality the opposite might be true. Currently it looks like an overwhelming majority of hash power will not be mining SegWit blocks come August 1st.
Without the mining support to create blocks on the UASF chain, the economic value of the UASF chain is much lower.
Also, if UASF doesn't have enough mining support to reach a difficulty level adjustment before it times out in November, then the whole exercise is pointless, as then the UASF chain has no hope at all of overtaking the Status Quo chain. 
If any major exchange comes around and starts supporting BIP148, I might reconsider. Remember they are the worst hit, since they take a huge price dip during the split, not to mention rushing in a whole bunch of code changes to support both coin forks, and have to have some way to implement replay protection so they don't get screwed. So we will see on August 1 how things shake out...

Dandelion is great, but the article is a bit of a stretch... Dandelion as proposed doesn't deal with anonymization of transactions or balances like Zcash or Monero, it only deals with the network side by obfuscating where transactions are coming from by IP address.
Basically, think a mini-TOR inside the network for broadcasting transactions, where transactions privately bounce around a bit on a couple of nodes before being broadcasted in public.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:11:40
They chose that date because to do otherwise would risk an even worse scenario: where BIP148 activates but halfway-fizzles since it doesn't have any mining hash power support, and risks a chain split right before making rule changes. The Segwit2x devs are way more cautious than that.
See this thread with serious concern about the timing of BIP148, which resulted in much quicker consensus being programmed in to get SegWit2x locked in and starting to signal for SegWit.

The problem is Bitcoin is useful, moreso than ETH or LTC at the moment. You can actually spend it at real places, not just convert it at exchanges. It is closer to what a real digital currency should be.
But that doesn't mean BTC's dominant position can't change at the flick of a switch. Why would merchants want to deal with the fallout of a UASF split when they just want to convert to USD and get paid? LTC already works better than BTC on paper. ETH arguably has more innovation possibilities. Not a lot of pressure would be needed for merchants to switch to something else if BTC becomes unusable. There goes a large part of the economy.
This is why it is also a *stupid* idea for Bitcoin (maybe that's too strong... misguided maybe.) It has good intentions, but it also has severe side effects if something goes wrong.

Yes, you are right of course, I was trying to make the point that the change for the larger blocksize is something that was planned out from the beginning by Satoshi, and the activation will play out in 2x effectively the same way, pick a block, up the limit.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:09:44
You may find it surprising how many people prefer compromise over political fights and extremism.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:50:36
A bunch of extra validating nodes won't do the people with the gold (exchanges and merchants) any good... they need hash power to keep the blocks coming and the transactions flowing. Whatever chain those transactions end up confirming on in the most timely manner will win. That is the network effect in action.
Nodes are cheap, hash power is everything. Spin up 1000 UASF nodes on EC2, they can reject blocks all day. But if the transactions are still flowing on some chain... the people with the gold are happy.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:32:05
Hmm yeah that is interesting, so you are correct, since it seems like even SegWit itself as currently implemented is not enough to prevent covert ASICboost (for blocks containing no witness data.) So neither SegWit nor SegWit2x will officially prevent all covert forms of ASICboost as originally asked.
So I guess a HF is required to prevent all forms of ASICboost...




@_date: 2017-06-23 02:58:32


That someone actually stepped up and wrote code to compromise instead of just trying to take the network hostage and force their position on others?
That someone got consensus from all, instead of just spewing hostility without any critical thinking?
Honestly, Segwit2x is the exact compromise solution that everyone was looking for a year and a half ago, so it's not really shocking that it would happen. Just surprising that Core wouldn't be the ones leading the charge...
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:29:00
Yes they do want it to scale, why are they for a 2MB increase then, and have been asking for this for forever? This would definitely reduce their fees.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:20:56
This runs the risk of having everyone fork off without you, leaving you unable to move your coins (without upgrading your software to be compatible with the HF, of course.) Keeping your software the same doesn't prevent a HF.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:44:19
Probably, since this is a solution to the scaling agreement and solves a lot of current issues in Bitcoin and allows for much more innovation on the Bitcoin chain.
Of course, the market is irrational. Price could drop. HODL forever haha
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:11:10
Sorry, but without hash power UASF coins will not get any value on the market. If no blocks are created, and people can't transact with UASFcoins, they will quickly be pushed aside.
The only way to win this fight is with hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:01:42
Sure, maybe not 80,000, but they'll have enough Segwit2x nodes to keep the hard fork going. They will still have plenty for consensus and for a healthy network. 
Again, this doesn't prevent the hard fork from happening.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:30:45
If Segwit2x gets strong support as it looks like it currently has, I'm pretty sure Core will be forced to merge it in. I think most of their arguments were against the reckless HF schedule, but if it actually looks achievable and has such strong momentum, I think they might give in then try and stop it...
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:23:47
This doesn't prevent the hard-fork from happening, just makes it so that your are left alone on your own chain with no way to send transactions if you pick the wrong side.
At least 80% of the hashpower looks like they want to switch, they'll probably bring along a number of exchanges and payment processors...
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:18:37
The code is not ready yet; they are acknowledging that fact and showing support in a different way - in the coinbase part of the blocks they mine. Kinda like putting a bumper sticker on your car, though the election vote is the only thing that really matters.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:29:11
Agreed, because Segwit2x IS a HF, so there's no need to do one anymore. With Segwit2x it seems everyone wins - devs get SegWit, miners get bigger blocks, users get lower fees and future scaling and innovation.
Only core devs still are left with no support of Segwit2x, but it seems to be mostly political reasons. There are some valid concerns (like with the large blocksize effect on the network) but even that effect is not really known yet, and sometimes that is the price of compromise...
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:57:14
No, it's worse if people participate and are halfway successful (like 20-30% hashpower on the UASF chain, in the range of a reorg after weeks or months.)
Bitcoin would be royally fucked if a reorg were to happen and transactions get dropped during the split. Ideologically, everything's peachy with BIP148. But the lack of investor confidence after a chain split, and the screwing over of merchants, exchanges, and the people who REALLY are the economy behind Bitcoin, will have a lasting negative impact that Bitcoin may not recover from.
Anyways, if things start looking anywhere near successful on the UASF chain, I bet an immediate checkpoint hardfork will be attempted on the legacy chain to prevent a reorg from ever happening, with the big players in the market trying to preserve the status quo and salvage whatever is left of Bitcoin's reputation. This would convert the UASFcoins into a proper altcoin, and basically drop the value to zero, like what was threatened for Bitcoin Classic coins. Can you ensure Jihan won't take this approach? Or the rest of the 83% hashpower and developers that have signed up for the compromise solution?
In my view BIP148 is an armed nuclear bomb with the countdown timer ticking. Sure you can threaten its use with your enemies to 'win'. But if it truly goes off you will leave a path of collateral destruction behind... Unless it fizzles out with a whimper. Even though I want SegWit NOW, I am truly hoping for a UASF failure. I used to really like the option of a UASF, until I realized the destruction a chain split could cause to Bitcoin in the right circumstances. The rose-tinted view that Luke-Jr has of the situation, without mentioning the possible drawbacks, and the extremist positions people have taken on both sides, are really the opposite approach that should be taken when playing around with a multi-billion dollar economy. Winning over narcissistic assholes who owe their entire fortune to monopolizing the currency takes a bit longer. Patience is needed, not extremism.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:05:58
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:24:52
They did try, with Bitcoin Classic, which was a massive failure. Now they realize they have to get support from the major economic players in Bitcoin, give the users what they want at the same time, and go about things more smoothly. Which is where we are at now.
How are you thinking they have entire data centers dedicated to mining hardware, and millions of dollars invested into payment processing and network systems, but not enough to spin up a few nodes to validate their blocks? Of course there will be plenty of nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:18:15
Please read the whole thread... I was confused as well but it seems to be a poor choice of wording by jgarzik.








Segwit by itself does disable covert ASICboost but not the overt/detectable form of ASICboost. But if that is used it will likely raise a shitstorm so I don't think it will happen.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:16:21
Umm... unless ChinaCoin activates SegWit first. Haha.
Anyways, please suck it up and accept the compromise that is Segwit2x. Holding out is bad for everyone who wants to see Bitcoin succeed.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:38:23
Yeah sure, that's the best case scenario. UASF technically wins because they took the network hostage August 1 and forced the miners to capitulate. But please tell me what was wrong in his original comment?
















Which part of that is incorrect?

@_date: 2017-06-25 05:22:13
This is actually good for moving up the Segwit2x schedule if they do this - signaling SegWit early helps the full activation time after the bit 4 period ends, thus making the 2x HF happen faster.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:38:22
WTF are you talking about? Bitcoin and btc1 share 99.9% of the same code. The activation logic for both the Segwit2x signaling and the HF are easily reviewable, and can be easily merged by Core should they desire.
The project is developed in the open and anyone is free to post issues in the github repo if they see a problem with it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:53:55
I personally don't see Core quickly attempting to create something better than what Segwit2x offers, especially since the most common objection from Core is that the HF timeline is too short. The btc1 project has enough momentum to be the only way out now without things turning into a MAJOR shitshow.
Enough miners are only rooting for Segwit2x at this point, and not trusting Core - it may be difficult for Core to regain trust of the network in the future. Core is kinda in a lose-lose position now, since if they don't go along with Segwit2x and it succeeds, it shows they are not really in full control and miners can do things without their support; and if it fails and destroys Bitcoin, people will blame them for not trying hard enough to make it work, and for mishandling the HF transition as stewards of the software.
Anyways, the changes for the HF and Segwit2x activation are a small enough diff from Core right now that it should be very easy to merge the changes back in, assuming Core wants to play ball.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:24:38
Yeah... as needed...




The problem is Bitcoin has been near 100% block size limit for &gt; 1 year now. So it is well ahead of LTC in needing that scaling discussion.
Current LTC blocks are around 20 KB (2%.) 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:04:53
The hardfork code is very simple though. Follow along here:
In the function MaxBlockBaseSize on [line 31]( it returns the base size of the block. Either MAX_BLOCK_LEGACY_SIZE (the current 1MB) if BIP102active() returns false, or 2 MB.
So what is BIP102active()? Look up [a bit]( and see that it defines it as: To return true, Segwit must be locked in AND BIP102_FORK_MIN_HEIGHT must not yet be reached.
So, assuming Segwit has activated, then once the block at BIP102_FORK_MIN_HEIGHT is reached (block  defined on line 12, and approximately 94 days from now,) then BIP102Active returns true, meaning the rules change and MaxBlockBaseSize() now returns 2 MB.
The hard fork comes in at this point since if you are not running this code, then the consensus fails when a miner delivers you a 2 MB base block, and you reject it.
See some more discussion here: [Port of BIP102 into btc1]( in the [pull request with lots of discussion](
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:04:02
If the NYA signaling is any indication, pretty much the day binaries are released we will be locked in...
POW change is impossible. No developer wants to turn Bitcoin into its own altcoin.

They are small enough that they might not mine more than 1 block a day, they may not show up on the graph.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:33:23
If it is likely that momentum is strong with Segwit2x, then Coinbase will probably switch over and go for a HF. After all, they have signed support for the New York Agreement, so they know a HF is coming.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:58:40
Wow if we've learned anything over the past year or so, it is that being political as a miner DOES pay very well with stall tactics and high fees.
The problem is thinking that a UASF with such a small amount of hash power has any chance at all. Bitcoin has always been about consensus in the network defined by the amount of hash power you bring to the table, this is in the code. NOT the number of nodes. Remember at the end of the day developers write whatever code they want to execute their own politics and rhetoric.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:33:40
The problem is that merchants who signed up to try out Bitcoin acceptance get royally screwed. If they don't drop all cryptocurrency completely at this point, then they will switch another coin like LTC and BTC becomes useless.
Could you imagine if Visa said 'sorry everyone who had people buy things from you in the last few weeks, those transactions are now invalid. No, there is no recourse.' Holy shit.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:42:28
Did you see this sentence?


Curious, would you rather Bitcoin usage be made illegal? Where any attempt to buy or sell with local bitcoin deals (since, obviously, you couldn't use an exchange or ATM) could be honeypots by the cops or FBI to arrest you?
If the government can't tax it, this is exactly what you will get. Pretty much everyone uses Bitcoin for its utility as a currency, not for its presumed anonymity. I mean, every coin that ever exists, every transaction made is 100% visible to everyone who uses it, forever! Anyone truly interested in anonymity might see that as a stumbling block...
Luckily, you can still get what you want with a different coin. Look to Zcash or Monero.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:00:33
The problem is, the miners secure the network. And suddenly having 20% of the hashpower is a recipe for disaster for people who actually want to use Bitcoin. 1-hour blocks for 3 months straight (assuming 20% hashpower, and the max time until difficulty adjustment) is very bad for business, not to mention tx fees on these blocks will be exorbitant! Not to mention taking out any hope of having mainstream adoption or real investment.
Unfortunately I see major economic powers (the exchanges and merchants currently running Core software) caving under that much pressure, and users will be forced to follow.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:55:25
Mostly.* Apparently there can still be a covert boost by swapping around the ordering of the merkle tree inside the block, while also not including any SegWit witness data (since even with SegWit enabled, valid blocks do not HAVE to include any witness transaction data.)
Though, I think that for the vast majority of blocks, enabling SegWit will render ASICboost inert.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:22:20
Huh? That's a completely different group.
What issues do you see with BTC1?
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:02:16
Regardless, he is still correct. Which part of what he said is incorrect?
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:29:18
SegWit, *when SegWit transactions are included in the block*, prevents ASICboost.
However, in the current SegWit implementation, blocks can still be valid without having any SegWit transactions included, pretty much matching the old format. Therefore if a block doesn't have any SegWit transactions in it, it still might be using ASICboost.
See this issue to see if there should be more of an effort to ban all types of ASICboost, in Segwit2x:
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:38:13
Turns out a lot of people's businesses directly benefit from a scaling upgrade that people can agree on, the majority of the Bitcoin economy in fact.
Personally, I think Segwit2x is rushed, and I would much prefer it to have a sliding blocksize limit. Without it we will still have to do more hard forks sometime in the future if we need to to get other size blocks. I like the idea of SegWit, but unfortunately SegWit-based solutions don't go far enough, fast enough, to support Bitcoin's insane demand. 
So I appreciate compromise, and support the improvement now even if its not perfect, the debate has gone on too long.

@_date: 2017-06-20 04:47:48
Hmm, possibly, but I'm more optimistic hoping that after this problem is solved no one will want to have this discussion for a long time, and focus on other areas instead, especially building things with SegWit.
I think the 2MB increase is important though - if consensus can happen, it is an immediate solution to the scaling issue, and is much more compatible with current deployed software used in wallets, exchanges, payments, etc. (of course, assuming upgrade to be HF-compatible.) 
With SegWit-based solutions, transaction formats change - pretty much all software would have to rewrite core parts of transaction handling to take advantage of SegWit features. Just look at Core's notes for handling segwit upgrades:  That's a lot of work that will take time for all wallets and payment mechanisms to support it.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:18:31
Core merges the simple patches that make up /btc1, then both versions become identical as far as the network is concerned. 
Miners/users/whoever can give control back to Core at any time after that, on a normal upgrade cycle.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:29:09
Good thing there is open source code to look at, making what is going on crystal clear. If you look at the pull requests going into the btc1 project, you can see why it is called Segwit2x. Because with Segwit activation there is an additional HF included to 2MB at a specific block height, giving an immediate 2x increase in capacity at HF (and even more if you count SegWit's scaling options.)
Nothing 'suspicious as fuck' about it, it is clear from the goals of the various agreements that have happened over the last year that this is what compromise looks like.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:00:16
Sorry, no one wants to use an illegal currency. Want to use them with any legitimate online business? Sorry, too bad. There goes 90% of your adoption and price rise right there. Remember, price rise is correlated with demand, if there is no demand, there is no price rise. Look at any altcoin.


They CAN tax it now. I wouldn't be surprised at all if exchanges are reporting to the IRS already, and if the IRS started auditing Bitcoin users. Or if the IRS starts fining exchanges that don't report.
Also, if you are a US citizen converting it to USD, they DO have jurisdiction, and you must pay capital gains tax on it, same way as if you buy any other asset and sell it for USD. One of the great joys of living in a free country!
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:13:34
It has been stagnant because the blocks have been at max capacity. You can only fit so many transactions in a block.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:08:41
Nothing like this has happened in Bitcoin before. If it goes wrong, like if enough people hold out against the hard fork part of Segwit2x, then it is definitely possible that this destroys trust in Bitcoin, and people move their funds to altcoins instead.
This is why it is important to have people suck it up and accept Segwit2x. It's not a bad change, honestly, Bitcoin needs the extra growing room. The sooner we all get along the sooner moon.
