A good shout, I'll make an edit with a rough location.

It does help, massively in fact.

The £100 is money I was looking to invest in buying some bankrupt stock and selling on eBay to make profit. I heard about bitcoin and wondered if that was a better way. The profit might be small to start, but I can wait and see if it can grow. 
And a massive thankyou for the help, I'll check out the link now.

Wow, it is!
Good luck with Bitcoin, if all goes tits up then I've got a spare room you can hole out in.

Thanks for the heads up! And I'll definitely be taking you up on the offer of help when I manage to flounder in the waters. 
Thanks again!

I was going to try and buy some bankrupt stock with the money and sell for profit on eBay. But after hearing about Bitcoin I thought it might be a better way to make a little cash.
But thanks for the concern!

I didn't mean that I was going to sell the Bitcoins on eBay. My alternative was to buy bankrupt stock (electronics etc.) and sell them on.

Sorry for being a total newbie.
Thanks for the help though!

Guess I should wait a bit before investing...

Yeah I just saw they were around £105 and they've gone to £98 last time I checked. I was on Mt. Gox though so I'm unsure whether that was the right thing to check out.
Thanks for the reply though, much appreciated.
