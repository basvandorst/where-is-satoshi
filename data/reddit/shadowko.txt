Thank you guys, i was not expecting it, but some 2 kind anonymous guys also donated to my friend!!! Wow...
Since many of you asked and like it. I made it by myself (Im working as a graphic designer). It is laser engraved and then cut from material called ROWMARK (used for door nameplates for example)
You can do it yourself also!
