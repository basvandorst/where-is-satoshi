Coin source done took a scat on themselves with their newest T.O.S.
In Las Vegas alone I have had over 50 people say Coinsource is no longer a valid source to cash out coin.  Their fees are outstanding, I just withdrew $3k and the fee via was $800+ 
It is obviously clear as day that from now on Monero is the only way.  By the way, in Vegas there are Bitcoin head shops/ kiosk

Is this due to Mycelium not having Segwit ?

So what happens is that when the price adjust where the miners feel it's worth passing your tx, it will go through.
I have heard of pen testing involving trying to double spend which will theoretically make the network reject both tx giving the possibility of getting your coins back before they go through whenever the blockchain gods (miners/mining pools) decide it deemed worthy

Seriously, I have had friends I never knew I had call me up asking me about btc or for hand outs.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:45:57
So has Mycelium ?

That's a bold bet considering the last person to lay down a bet in the bitcoin space had to eat his baseball cap.

This is true, however, they go through several steps to ensure that the original owner of the account sees someone is trying to get in.
With Google Authenticator, there is a way to get in without using SMS, another email account, and that one validates instantly without warning the owner of the account in which the attacker is trying to disable the 2FA from Google Authenticator. 
Saving the keys for Google Authenticator is best choice though.

Well, it will continue to ask you to supply a phone number or private key, then you can continue to say you don't have those try another way, 'till it ask if you would like to use another email to retrieve access to your account.  
Simple deduction penetration testing.

Bisq has been around for a while.
It is going to gain traction now that it is starting to push for more USD volume.

Usually if says check sum invalid it means that is not 12 words at all, meaning you might have got them confused when you were writing them down or worst mixed them up.

This is a practice even evangelist of 2FA forget themselves sometimes.

BTC= aol
XMR= web 3.0
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:24:15
LTC &amp; ETH also!?  
Now you caught my interest.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:28:01
April fools?!?
Come on sheeple, Whole Foods, nor, Amazon, nor, CVS, is accepting BTC directly, there are 3rd party entities involved, you are more than likely sometimes transacting with no more than possibly an unlicensed money transmitter for digital goods.
Oh yeah, like "Possession of stolen Goods", "Possession of stolen Digital Goods" can get you in a tight corner.
There are only a few established apps that one can feel like they are buying from Wal-Mart with BTC, Gyft, etc.
However, I would never place trust in any other ventures on the sole strength that we have already super seeded that and as aforementioned on another comment, BTC is not finable for coffee or buying $14 Cold Pressed OJ

I noticed Bitmain accepts BCC.  They sell them Ant-Miners.
Are there any other places might take this garbage?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:48:33
Very peculiar how some exchanges and merchants are participating in the BCC ecosystem.
