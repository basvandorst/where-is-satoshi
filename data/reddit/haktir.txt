Those saying monero is centralized, how so? It seems to be more decentralized than most coins, including btc because of the massive asic farms. At least with monero you can cpu mine and have a chance.

What's a cold card? Just a paper wallet?
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:35:25
How would that work?
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:49:44
Holy crap u/GrapeJelly are you a whale?
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:46:00
Pretty sure that's what's going on

Or it's an actual time Traveller, if you were and wanted to stay anonymous you'd use 4chan

I'd just switch to a local credit union, after you get back your money of course.

does this include trezor and ledger?

Wasabi wallet is pretty good for coin-joining. And I wouldn't be surprised if btc implemented mimble-wimble after ltc does.

if it did it wouldnt even matter the idea is alive, and you cant kill an idea

Not until predictions started coming true. Who would trust some anon without proof
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:11:38
That's exactly why I don't use Robinhood

Cme trades paper Bitcoin to drive the price down
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:34:47
They just use it to short with less risk, I'm sure most of them already own some amount of btc so that either way they see profit
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:01:43
But cme's paper Bitcoins they could double or even triple the supply, at least as far as analytics are concerned.
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:39:08
Cme trades btc settled in cash, no btc is owned or exchanged but it still is counted as btc. I think there's upwards of 1 million btc that's been traded this way effectively adding more than the 21 million cap.

I see futures holding btc down for as long as usd manages to survive. The moment the dollar starts to crack, and everyone starts to notice, that's when we'll moon

Wow iohk actually did something cool

Nice try, Mnuchin

idk if it has a camera built in or one nearby, but if it does facial recognition will get you. they say its not being used but the infrastructure to do this is well established all they have to is use it
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:15:08
Why not?
@_date: 2019-09-05 22:50:00
I know that much, but what's the argument for or against?
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:40:30
Chinese miners
@_date: 2019-09-05 18:00:32
So why is the blocksize debate a thing?
