There are others here saying this is inconclusive.  For whatever reasons they are saying this Gox lawyers will exploit those reasons. Lawyers paid for with everyone's stolen cash.

This would have to be proven which is impossible. Everyone's Bitcoins will he used to construct the best defense team ever.

Probably the most absurd post I've ever seen here.

Could be mob coercion.

Doesn't matter if it paper or electronic currency. I used to be a banking center manager. I would see trust scams all the time against the elderly. One guy gave a random stranger on the street his entire life savings, about 26k, because the guy had a lottery ticket worth 300k that he could not cash in because he was an illegal immigrant. I don't see how giving money to an exchange without any legal recourse is different.

How can you trust any of the exchanges without regulation. Any of them can do this at any given time under the protection of bankruptcy laws and without consequence. Am I mistaken here?

Haha. May be drugs. I used to rehab properties and sometimes when we paid the guys they wouldn't show up for a few days. They had stories just like this.

A lot of people here are over leveraged and that could mean serious trouble. A bunch of Internet kids with no investment experience dumping all their money into one stock. If that's not a recipe for disaster I don't know what is.
