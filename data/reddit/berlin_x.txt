pivotal in what way?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:35:24
Even more interesting to me: Are we expecting another drop because of those futures? Like a couple weeks ago...
Or could that also result in a boost for BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:39:32
You mean "support"!?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:36:55
I second that:)
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:12:50
Alright ...sounds like a silverlining... Thanks

|Just a couple of questions for you guys|
|1) Using binance: what are the biggest downsides?|
|2) What is your favourite wallet when it comes to ease of use?|
feel free to answer either or both
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:29:31
How can the market cap be growing if the prices per crypto are dropping... isn't this a contradiction?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:23:47
Well, imho he has a point saying that BTC's value has been on the decline a month now... The true value of BTC is of course in the underlying technology (which is tremendous).  
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:15:23
I think we were indeed for the last week but we just broke through it. Part of the reason was the low trading volume at the end of the year and the pivotal price movement. I think we'll see stranger variations (into both directions) from now on again.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:58:34
this, however, sounds quite reasonable. thanks for elaborating.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:16:30
come on...sounds like a cheap conspiracy theory...
any way to back this up?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:30:05
I'm pretty worried that if BTC is not able to break through the resistance line around 11.500 the whole downward trend will simply start again...
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:32:13
nice one:)
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:09:23
Thanks for the pessimistic outlook;)
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:42:08
Why is trading volume currently so low on GDAX?
Only like 1.700 BTC ...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:26:56
Sounds more like wishful thinking...any way to back up your assumption? So long I gotta agree with u/LSDemon
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:16
The bigger the "step", the more it turns into a "wall" of coins that have to be purchased before the price can rise further.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:45:46
well...if you're still holding and you didn't sell when it was crashing then technically you haven't lost anything yet;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:15:24
Yeah...well this probably goes for everything in investing. But is maybe a little bit too broad. I've been thinking about this a lot recently and I think most people (who are not set for life yet) can never really "afford to loose money" - unless they are investing so little, that (and this is my main point) the gains wouldn't be worth the risk either! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:07:00
...way too late for that. Investors unwrapping their christmas gifts is more likely what's happening...
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:16:09
Check out the "Depth Chart"...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:01:25
Quick question...since I am still new to the game (it's my first bitcoin crash - that's how new I am to this;)... Still learning to interpret the candle charts. But to all those who are very familiar with the depth charts: In times like these, seeing this huge, massive wall of sale orders just sitting there and the relative small amount of buy orders on the other side - how should I read this in order to not just get scared like an idiot?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:22:38
Very interesting point indeed...
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:53:08
Oh f***! Kudos for not giving up though and getting back into the race!! That's the spirit:) It's going to be okay.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:30:33
sorry man...don't think we're going to see this crazy bounce back ("to the mooooooon!!") we all were hoping for...at least not over Christmas and New Year. There's just not enough support right now in the market. When do you wanna go short? What are you hoping for? I personally will probably go short around 16.6k...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:43:21
Well...sort of. Coinbase shutting down didn't cause the dip. It was them reacting to the market crashing. IMHO was either them trying to slow down the dip (panic sellers) or technical issues due to the insane amount of transactions and new signups. Once you signed up for Coinbase and transferred cash/bitcoins into your account you can always switch to GDAX instantly (owned by coinbase) and avoid transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:01:35
Man...there are still a lot of really high sell walls between us and 13k
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:26:46
Awesome, thanks for putting it into perspective man!! Although I would argue, that the dynamic of the market in 2017 might be a little different compared to 2013, when it was basically only early adopters and a few investors impacting the price. However, what about 2016? Exactly the same as well? Why did you pick 2013 as a comparison? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:22:22
Well, GDAX is available in Germany...so Coinbase/GDAX should work and therefore you can avoid trading feeds unless you do Market Price trades only.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:11
Would you guys agree that because there was a strong enough support line around 11,5k (for the 2nd time now) that even despite all the negative press during this current crash about Bitcoin being „not real“ and „super unsafe“, all those panic shorts won't be able to break through that? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:59:57
Pls elaborate...who is Ver.?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:45:02
But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's the best option out there. I just think it's a good way to get started. Especially considering that it will take a long time until you get verified on any platform you might as well wanna get started sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:12:20
Dunno about you guys, but I think Asia is not necessarily going to stop the downwards trend (although they could and probably will buy quite a bit) just because a lot of "stop loss" orders will have been triggered automatically when they wake up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:30:59
Yeah...just realized;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:43
u mean around 2879?
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:31:26
So you're still expecting a stronger rebound? Cause according to those charts this could have already been it...with a current high around 16k 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:05:17
Magic 8-ball or actual "technical analysis"?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:27:09
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:10:04
Weird...it’s not anymore on my browser....
But hey, if it’s just me...never mind:)
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:32
Well...it's a little bit more complicated than that. As long as you can back up your "concerns" with data or phrase them carefully, I think nobody gets annoyed. Anything to drastic can quickly seem like you're just trying to influence people's opinions (or elections;) 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:00:15
Very disappointed in the west coast today... Had high hopes in everybody waking up to buy into the dip... but instead everybody is selling.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:04:19
Okay guys... I think we can all agree, that we believe in the idea of cryptocurrency and all of us know that the blockchain technology itself will only get more popular and successful in the future. 
The value of bitcoin in my opinion depends massively on how it's being perceived in the public eye and therefor on how it's being portrayed by the media on a daily basis. This will either make people buy or sell (or not even get in). And in my opinion there has been a shift recently from "it's risky and speculative and you can loose money as fast as you can make some" to "it's super dangerous, pure evil and nobody should invest in it".
My question to all of you out there who are serious about investing in bitcoin is: 
Where do you see potential in early 2018 for this public opinion to change and as a result cause bitcoin to rise again and not plummet?
Or do you think I am overestimating the impact media has no the price of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:45:45
Shouldn't the Daily Discussion be pinned to the top of the page?
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:10:55
The thing is the market doesn’t have to necessarily crash only because some whales have been cashing out recently. Large investment firms and equity funds can easily turn into new whales and not to mention all the private investors joining the game in 2018. So it can go on even if it were just a “Greater Fool Scenario”.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:43:30
Definitely a good way to start! Usability is great and most exchanges are struggling in times of extreme trading moments. You can easily move on to GDAX after you got acquainted with Coinbase and you feel like it's not "sophisticated" enough or the fees are getting too high (which is definitely the biggest downside)
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:49:41
That's a loaded question...
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:56:10
well...not really...I still think, long term BTC will recover from this. But the question is (and that's where chart analysis gets interesting), will it first keep getting lower...
 
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:56:48
Fair enough:) Maybe a bit pessimistic. 
But no, didn't sell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:47:13
Looks like a bull trap to me... long term trend is still negative, trading volume is high, trend line resistance has not been overcome yet...
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:59:28
This's only because the charts are moving horizontally and there is not much going on. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:20:06
Keep reading about people (press) making negative predictions on BTC because of the futures being due tomorrow... What are your thoughts on that? Will the futures tomorrow have a positive or negative impact on the price?
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:18:04
100k??? You insane. That's wishful thinking and not at all investing strategy related.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:21:33
mmmh... I'm wondering that myself. Public opinion seems to be the opposite though?!
