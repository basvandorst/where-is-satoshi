SegWit works well. It changes the way we count the number of transactions that fit into a block. We’re not limited by 1 MB anymore. There’s a certain max “weight” which is around 1.7 MB. So effectively we can store up to 1.7 MB in a block.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:59
Why was segwit needed? Can you explain segwit to me?

I think that getting lightning out there is more essential. Many people hold bitcoin and businesses will want to adopt something that many people know about. Monero has been doing well.

I also want to use satoshis instead of bits. However mBTC works too.

Can we donate to a fund that works on cryptocurrency/bitcoin :)?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:11:37
Might this backfire? 1 bit is worth less than a dollar. Would people be happy with buying many that are "worthless".
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:00:41
Thanks. I actually read both articles before you posted lol. I guess it's time for me to do more research.

Universal income may also become a thing where everyone receives a base amount of income for necessities. With automation occurring, this will make the world more efficient and thus probably grant everyone enough to live on.

I imagine the lightning network providing bitcoin with much success. There will also be other cryptocurrency partnerships that will add to bitcoin's reputation. $40,000 by May. $80,000 in November. $95,000 in December.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:39
Wow. So it's around 6 months overdue? Seems like things are getting close though. Thanks for the explanation too! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:14:37
You're right about the idea that people would panic regardless of when they made the announcement. However, it's how they made the announcement that is suspect. They could've told everyone in advance. In addition to that, they could've gave everyone their tokens before they allowed trading. Oh wait, on top of that, they decided to continue with the implementation fully knowing that their servers couldn't handle the influx of traders.

Just wait for China to unban Bitcoin.

This should be upvoted more. There’s also an additional point where you don’t own the crypto and they can trade it freely. It’s like buying another currency such as Canadian dollars. Imagine you bought $1m worth of Canadian dollars and just held it on Robinhood. They can just loan or trade your $1m worth while you let it sit there...

Lightning has passed 75/75 tests. All we need to do now is let it go through beta and then officially release it.

Ethos will replace Coinbase. Get on the Ethos train while you can!

There's still time to become an "early adopter".
Adoption of technology usually comes in 5 phases. 
These phases consist of the "Innovators" (2.5%), "Early Adopters" (13.5%), "Early Majority" (34%), "Late Majority" (34%), and "Laggards" (16%). 
You can help accelerate the adoption of this new technology as well as become an early adopter today! All you need to do is educate yourself and maybe even buy a little Bitcoin!

Now that you mentioned this, it really makes sense for the capacity to be &gt; $1000. Maybe upwards to $2k for the laptop scenarios.

Hmm... if Amazon doesn’t research this, then another country will.
It’s not the technology that’s inherently bad, it’s the use of it. Take nuclear energy for example. 
Amazon retail expansion is a different story. I think a lot of people need to think of entities as having multiple components. After all, companies nowadays seem to have a monopoly over many areas.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:32:22
Amazon conducts a lot of experiments to benefit everyone... would you rather a company that makes progress have a lot of money or rich people who don’t try anything to benefit your lives?
A lot of people avoid taxes (and not evade them). You should really be attacking the loopholes and laws. If they don’t actively avoid them, then their competitors (all the other tech companies will). 
This isn’t an Amazon issue. It’s not just a company issue either. It’s a wealth disparity and knowledge issue.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:53:11
Okay. I’m wondering how you feel about Facebook, Google, and Microsoft though.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:57:45
Well I like how you’re consistent.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:47:53
Like I said, this isn’t an Amazon only thing. 
This is called the Amazon Effect though, where when they move into an industry such as USBs, GPUs, pharmaceuticals, etc. you get cheaper products of the same quality (hopefully). 
This is just inevitable and Amazon wouldn’t be the only company or force of nature to do this. 
You should direct your hatred at an intangible entity that doesn’t exist. I agree with you that this phenomenon isn’t great for some people, but it just exists/happens. Also, I’ve been on both sides of the phenomenon.

Nice polynomial reduction.

The blockchain is great for verifying digital assets. With lightning coming out, it'll be gold that's deflationary in a sense and easy to transport. Even though lightning supports the ability for Bitcoin to be used in micro transactions, Bitcoin might not be used solely as a form of "currency". Currencies tend not to fluctuate in value. The gold analogy is a great one though.

Actually Chinese New Years lasts 15 days..... it’s be nice if everyone could pay more attention to the culture and consumer habits of the predominant countries participating in crypto.

Hey guys. Technology along with the economy matters. To neglect this is like saying you're willing to work for free and that your time and efforts are meaningless. Financial capital can be converted into human capital which consists of knowledge, health, and skills. Financial capital and human capital can also be converted to social capital which consists of the value of social relationships. If we work together, we can achieve what is valuable and truly important to us.
We need to start caring about the economics and price of bitcoin as it is intertwined with the technology.
I want to try this experiment where we spread positivity throughout this subreddit. We lack many datapoints and it's very hard to be confident about the future. We can at least try to control for variables and gather more data.
