People aren't going to run and the idea that EVERYONE is going to short it foolish. Where will the requisite LONGS come from if everyone shorts?
Been reading more and more into these shorts and I think it's going to be way less of an event than some people think. This isn't even true shorting of the coins, it's cash settled! The only thing these futures will do to truly influence the price is FUD-based. Stop being a part of it. 
Sell, buy, or HODL, but keep your opinions like this to yourself, or at the very least make sure you frame things as OPINION and maybe consider admitting your limited knowledge in your op. This doesn't make any actual sense given the facts of what's going on right now.

Lol. One day it doesn't go up 1k+ and shit like this is everywhere. It may dip, it may even 'crash' a bit, but it will rebound. Too much money to be made on the upside, and too many people wanting in. Sorry you missed out bro.

There’s no other wholly finite store of value with the same advantages as bitcoin. They’ll be making gold in labs in the next 20 years. And/or mining endless amounts from asteroids. 
And try moving/traveling/fleeing your home with gold bars. Good luck!
Bitcoin is a new paradigm for individual finances. Keep reading about it. Watch all Andreas vids on YouTube. When it clicks for you how unstoppable and unprecedented it is, try not to fomo all in on a high ��
And hodl. It’s worth the bet.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:29:43
You own any gold?
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:00:56
I just don’t know what you’re thinking - realistically - they could or would ‘do’. Banning it? Maybe? How does that work tho? Making it illegal to have it? Good luck finding all of it. People would/should be willing to move if that’s the case. 
I agree with another commenter who said any large attempt at controlling bitcoin is an amazing case for bitcoin, and would likely only drive more people in/price up. 
I don’t see govts making moves other than buying up bunches of it for themselves.

Get Trezor on amazon. Just make sure it's sealed up when you receive. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:24:47
Can you define - even broadly - what you think the concerted effort will entail? Very difficult to stop a technology like this... as evidenced by its continued existence and the attempts at banning in various regions having very little effect. 
Bitcoin is valuable because it’s very difficult to focus a concerted effort on a decentralized network all across the world with no corporate overlords holding the reins.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:28
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:51:32
No. Alt coins are speculative noise. They just are. They’re for people who didn’t get in on bitcoin early who want to stack huge bags, and ofc some will get lucky with big pops from hype, fomo, other moonbois and shilling various coins around. 
Most have virtually no utility, no reason for being except to enrich the centralized people in charge and a few lucky gamblers. 
You’re looking at signals that aren’t worth looking at. This capitulation has been epic. We’ve rebuilt support all the way from 5k. Bitcoin has value. It’s being proven and its scarcity is going to fuel the price higher and higher.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:02
Lol @ this ATTEMPTED fud. Of course it fluctuates. What do people expect? No downs EVER? This is trash

If you send USD to coinbase wallet, you can then transfer it to GDAX and avoid paying fees to purchase bitcoin on limit orders. 
Takes a couple days I believe, but can save you $

I believe It is currently beyond the point where very very low/middle class have enough capital purchasing power to become 'wealthy'. I think there's massive gains to be had still, and I still consider this 'early', but it's no longer going to be churning out dozens of millionaires who invested hundreds. 
...or maybe it WILL. Good for all of us if I'm wrong!
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:31:18
a lot depends on if you consider Satoshi's million or so coins 'lost'
I think I've read 8-10% of coins are in lost/forgotten/inaccessible wallets
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:17:58
Why sell? Just be patient. Buy at these lower levels. Stack sats. Go get stoned and chill
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:59:02
The packaging is incredibly durable/would EASILY show if anyone had tampered. Check a YouTube unboxing. 
Also, when you plug a new device in and activate the browser wallet client, Trezor.io scans your device and it won't function if there's any malware. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:47:55
I doubt we will see 5k again
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:41:55
Don't fret. This happened to me earlier, and I tried a couple more times over the next half hour and it went through just fine. Received and confirmed on my trezor.

Just buy dips. They often follow ATH's. Like yesterday we had a lot of time at $8200, but that dropped to the 7700-7800 range. I bought a bit at that dip even. It's all averaging and just being a tiny bit patient whenever it's EXPLODING.

Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:59:47
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:58:35
Order a trezor. 
Then, coinbase account, deposit fiat, transfer fiat to GDAX, use GDAX (your coinbase account is connected/the same) to avoid fees when buying. 
Transfer coins to your trezor. 
HODL and hope for the best with the rest of us!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:50:11
Trezor is very safe and very easy to use. Can buy on Amazon even, just be sure the packaging hasn't been tampered with. I love my trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:48:33
Just dont see it. Ive looked at the order books. Of course anything is possible but see how quickly that shock drop got back up today? I only wish I had an order waiting around 8k

Coinbase isn’t such a bad place to purchase, it’s definitely user-friendly and streamlined and makes purchasing easy for new users. 
The general concern about ALL exchanges is security of your funds, as unless you control the private keys, the coins aren’t technically yours. That’s why it is best practice to move coins off of exchanges onto secure storage options such as hardware wallets, etc. 
Happy that you’ve taken the plunge! Do some reading, lots of info here and in the sidebar. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:41:30
This is more of a suggestion for very active traders... which most people probably shouldn’t be/would be better off buying and holding after doing some research. This isn’t a get rich quick play.

Major resistance on upside is going to be around 6k. Downside, if we fall past even 4700ish I see it heading straight back into the 3.7-3.8 range, if not even lower 3k’s

Which do you recommend? And what is that process like? Have only ever held on exchanges, just looking for some info
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:08:37
Bro keep some liquid. Or at least SOME in like CD's or something that has a guaranteed return. 
I'd put 30-40% max in btc. Keep 10 percent cash/savings account. Prolly another 10% in a checking/spending. Then, at this point depending on your knowledge and experience, probably some into more traditional investments. Diversify. 
Good luck

This is wrong. Total money in the GLOBAL economy? First of all not an easy thing to quantify... but just googling quickly found 80 trillion as the first number I saw... which divided by 21 million coins is like 3.8 million each. 
Not sure what numbers you crunched to get that 600k
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:36:30
Get a Trezor
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:52:14
I get the sentiment, but this “shot up” isn’t near high enough to be annoyed about because of that reasoning. Think bigger. If this gets MINIMAL use on any larger scale (govt., e-commerce, institutional investment, store of value like gold) it’s going to be worth exponentially more than it is now. Still incredibly small group of people involved, still limited use, still potential for huge appreciation.
