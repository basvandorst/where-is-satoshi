Thank you for the feedback!
I guess I already knew that the information on the site was a little behind, but I´ll get right on it.

Don't party with people that wants to steal your bitcoins...

OP delivers, at least partially.
**Eligius mining pool is now supported** and I have added a few screenshots to the frontpage.

BitMinter is a good place to start, easy client to start out with.

That would be a kinda cool actually

People like you are horrible...

Please add bitcoin.de :)

Danish: Bitcoin (Would be "Bitmønt", but that just sounds stupid and I have not heard anyone using that, but we don't really translate many tech related words in Denmark)

Is that the same as a buttload?

Cool shirt, but I think a shirt with 'brought with bitcoin' would be cool too.

Anyone know where I could buy a unfunded 1 BTC coin?
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:40:30
Cool idea, might "steal" it for myself as it would be quite cool as showing of Bitcoin to other people
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:26:20
Voted. (x6)
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:22:32
Well I´m in.
