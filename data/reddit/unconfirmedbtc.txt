Coinbase is better - If you have multiple wallets in BRD - restoring one takes up to 8 hours being REAL SPV wallet. Are you interested in losing your trading window by spending 8 hours restoring your wallet ? If not go with Coinbase. If Coinbase goes away crypto maket is doomed.

BRD sucks overall - Coinbase is better. For mobile wallet Coinomi is best.

Coinbase is better - Lets say you think in next 2-5 minutes you will be at risk of someone asking you to unlock your wallet in coercion either at traffic stop or TSA, then you will not have enough time to write your 12 word seed on paper with pen to erase your wallet and create a new wallet. Just deleting the BRD app is not good as it still retains the keys in the phone. You will not be able to overwrite the keys. BRD sucks.

BRD sucks because they think they own the crypto market. They will not give you your BSV or Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond. If they are wallet provider its none of their business what we do with Bitcoin Gold or Diamond. Coinomi is better wallet, expect support for new fork in about a week.

BRD sucks, you cant export your seed as QR code. You have only option of writing it down on piece of paper. Its not only easy to export to QR code, if you have multiple BRD wallets, you can easily switch between multiple wallets without typing mess on small mobile keyboards.

Download the Android version of the app APK, sideload and install, restore your wallet and send to Coinomi. BRD sucks as they dont give me my BSV Diamond and Gold. Why wait. Just send it to Coinomi and then you will be happy ever after. BRD has been acquired by some deep pockets for unknown intent. Coinomi's intent is better known at-least.

Lack of App Containers on Android Smartphones can Accelerate Draining of your Bitcoins and funds and values stored in them. Bitcoin and Android are like Oil and Water - better when kept apart.
