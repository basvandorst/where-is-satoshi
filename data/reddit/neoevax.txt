Decided to tip a bit on my cake day. Tip it forward! 50 bits private
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:18:05
Went ahead and tipped a few bits forward. Sometimes giving on your cake day is the best thing to do :)

Ahhh thats perfect. Nice of them to provide a work around. Though, still a bit frustrating we cant do it outright. I have quite a few ipad apps waiting to be purchased now :)

They accepted altcoins for awhile. But the system they used was not optimal. The owner said the amount of sales was not worth it. At least for now.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:29:19
I got 4. 3 of them where requests for 999999.99999999 BTC I wish I had that much...

I am pretty sure its Apple who has the issue. There is a workaround though. Just buy a normal Gyft Card. Then use that to buy the iTunes. It just takes an extra 30 seconds, and you can use bitcoin and get the bonus points like normal. I wish it was easier, but sometimes its the little victories that matter.

Thank you for reminding me this exists. 50 bits verify
First tip. Testing it out :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:50:28
I love seeing people in the community help eachother out like this. Plus it helps build up more transactions! :)
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:14:27
Done.. No harm. Come on free lunch!
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:16:44
Much thanks!!
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:08:55
Yeah it looks like its gone now.. From the Main Bundle, Weekly, and Store.
I tweeted them.. and I hope other people write to them.
This will be a sad day if the removed it.. My fingers are very tightly crossed it will come back.
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:23:12
Yeah, just looked.. How frustrating. I guess I will have to buy a ton of Amazon credit and use my gyft points to buy itunes... Wonder why this is the case..
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:54:30
OMG! It is my cake day! Wonder what I should do to celebrate...
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:17:32
Thank you sir!

I am glad Wikimedia is on there. Not sure what I would do without Wikipedia. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:06:40
Just when I started actually making a profit. Oh well. Good riddance. There are FAR too many scammers on that site. Now I Just have to wait a year for all my investments to make it back to me. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:57:07
Thanks. Very similar to what I thought. I know weight is a huge issue with drones. Not sure why I was downvoted either. Oh well. My curiosity has been answered. Might have to go dive into a drone subreddit someday.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:12:49
That is what I assumed. I just remember watching a video about a drone that lasts only maybe 5-10 minutes on a single battery charge. It must have been a cheaper drone I was looking into. Batteries are heavy... Just curious what a realistic prosumer drone's fly time is like.
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:16:33
All you would need is a decent enough rock and a good aim and you have weed falling from the sky!
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:53:07
That's fair. Not sure I have that much arm strength :). I was originally going to say a bb gun or slingshot, but backed off a bit. 
One question I am curious about is I have heard the battery life on those drones is only a few minutes. How far can one get with a package with enough power to get back? 
In all seriousness, I am seriously looking to buy a drone soon. Saving up for a good one now. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:41:42
Same here. I got mine loaded up a few weeks ago. It was pretty easy to do. Port opening was the hardest part, but I have done it enough times for other things it was cake. 
I feel great knowing I am helping the network. Even if my ISP like to threaten me. They are all bark no bight, right now at least.
@_date: 2015-10-15 03:08:26
Totally understandable. My post was mostly in humor. I just don't doubt someone out there is stupid enough.
@_date: 2013-07-11 23:28:42
I do not recall the Easter Sunday thing specifically. I do remember they hurried shipping a single ASIC to win a bet, or something. I don't really care about this, to be honest. 
I am not 12. I am 28 and a Senior Software Developer. And maybe a bit of a optimist. So be it. I have no control over BFL.. I will get over it, will you?
@_date: 2013-07-11 23:21:59
I am sure my Fiancée would enjoy hearing that. She is not afraid to cut a bitch. ha
@_date: 2013-07-12 21:13:54
I can live with that. Thank you random guy on internet.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:37:15
I would love to take out a bet on this, sadly all my money is tied up paying for my wedding. I only have .0004 BTC left in my wallet.. But hey, if you win and are willing to wait a few months.. Up to you sir.
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:43:36
That would have been nice. But according to the recent posts about shipping, they are starting to even out the shipping items.
If they have the option of shipping 10 Jalapenos and 1 Single.. or 0 Jalapenos and 1 Single, They are going to choose to ship more. THe Jalapenos are easier and faster to ship. They also have more of the parts to build them.
I bet all the product lines will even out soon.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:59:24
The site seems to be down. Any news as to what happened?
@_date: 2013-07-09 17:37:14
Sure some of the products are still shipping from June 23rd orders, but I imagine there were quite a few on the first day. Plus the Jalapenos are in September.
I know a lot of people ordered the Singles.. But with all the redesigning they had to do, it was only recently put into production. 
I guess I might be one of the only ones who is understanding of their timeline.. I am excited, and I have to exercise patience, but I also understand.
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:36:49
I honestly don't see them lying. They have had difficulties, and issues have cropped up with power and manufacturing. This is not their fault. 
Could they be doing a better job of estimating time? Definitely! Are the issues they are encountering their fault? Nope.
People can bitch all they want. I just want to say I am ok with them. I am excited to get my box, but I also know it might be awhile. I only put enough money into it, that I could lose. Bitcoin is still too new and cutting edge, that there are bound to be hickups. I would never throw all my savings into it.
People tend to bitch online more than send praise. I am just showing my support. If people want to freak out, feel free. I will be over here waiting patiently. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:43:07
Thank you for the very nice compliment. 
I was just attempting to say that, while most comments online seem to be very negative, I understand how hard it is to develop and produce a product. Things never go as they should. Issues with infrastructure, or scope creep. It will be done when its done. And I am ok with that.
But feel free to insult me. I can take it.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:32:55
From what I have read a ton of the wait was waiting for the chips to be produced and handed to them. 
Then it was testing, as the manufacturing of the chips was not perfect and there were plenty that had issues. They can only order so many waffers at a time, because they need to make sure everything is working. Especially since they are a small company, who has not made these exact chips before.
They then learned that the chips and boards they produced required a lot more power, so they redesigned the board for all of the products. This required design, then production, then delivery of those. Again, taking more time. 
Now they have all the designs done, and they have to wait for all the individual parts (including the new power supply's for the singles) to get to them. 
I know they have said they are ramping up assembly of the actual boxes. I know they have not released actual shipping amounts, just dates, but I have to assume there were tons of preorders near the beginning to get through. If  is even 50% of the actual orders, there are still tons to get through. 
So, maybe you are right. It is their "fault", but just so much as Software Bugs, Server crashes, Weekends, Holidays, and sick days are the fault of a software development company. They may have done a poor job of estimating how long things take, but that is a very common mistake in the developing world, as well, I assume, the hardware world.
You can be as mad as you want at them. I am not, and no matter how many times you call me a Dumb Twat or ass is going to change that. Insulting someone, even on the internet, is really good way of having a debate /sarcasm.
Oh, thanks for bringing Obama into this..... ha
