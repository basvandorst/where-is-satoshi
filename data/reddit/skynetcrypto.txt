i love this!! as i understand it stores the key on the device? i guess im just confused how the actually "card to card" transaction would work.
also is this meant to be used with a device or as a replacement?

1. Did NOT use referral system to open the account.
2. Their terms clearly state I can have a personal account AND a business account.
3. They have already "whitelisted me after cancelling a purchase i made last month. 
4. No response from their support team since i sent my response email explaining why i have two accounts. I'll give them 48 hours but this is pathetic. I shouldn't have to deal with this when I'm within the terms of the agreement.

im sorry, "launches" ? what exactly did they launch? that looks like a 3D rendering to me...
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:01:02
no, i am aware they are not an exchange. in fact, i've only been buying btc. I had sold only once to free up some cash. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:51:02
Yes please that would be awesome.

@_date: 2014-04-03 19:40:02
My post was about BUYING bitcoins, not storing them. i appreciate the lesson in security but however we phrase it, a 3rd party will still be used to purchase btc until a regulated exchange is established
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:02:01
They've cancelled my instant buy too. I cant believe these guys. I have a fully verified account thats been used for weeks. Now I add a business account, and my buys are completely frozen.

From what i hear, bitsCards are launching in new york soon. they have some kind of multi-sig load process combined with a tamper-proof seal 
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:44:20
Yes, I have a personal account, and a business account.
They've replied to my email stating that I am allowed to have one personal and one business account. I do not see how I am violating their terms in any way.

I'm fascinated by all things crypto and I feel like the bitcoin is protocol is the next major revolution in computer science. I'm glad we are all a part of this movement, because I feel like we're the guys who watched the Internet happen and couldn't really be a part of its growth because we were too young.
To me, bitcoin is INTERNET 2 - REVENGE OF THE NERDS.

I thought that, but i'm not sure i understand. YOu're saying the transaction will be "denied" by miners due to the fact that it is not a SHA-256 based address. However, we know that malformed addresses "receive" coins all the time.
If it is possible to send to a malformed address, how is a litecoin-to-bitcoin address spend not possible?
