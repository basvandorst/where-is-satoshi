I honestly implore you to take some time to read over the white paper and then do more research on what the technology does, and think about what it could do.  I was in a similar boat of not knowing much at first, but as I read about it I quickly realized that the potential for BTC and the protocol and blockchain are un*friggin*believable.
Then I bought more.  Haven't stopped since, really.

I would argue that they should be more worried about preserving their own wealth instead of trying to support a failing currency (the Ruble)
Edit: FFS, I meant the ruble as the failing currency.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:21:03
Yeah, ok

Testing the bottom twice prior to this definitely gives this one a different vibe.
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:34:42
I wasn't really aware - and didn't mean to sound so harsh with "want to remain average" was just going a bit off of the prior poster's use of the word.  I'm sorry if it came off rough :/
My genuine hope is that something like Bitcoin could enable everyone to have a stake in assets that aren't controlled by their government.  It's probably incredibly naive of me.

@_date: 2014-09-23 23:05:32
This is correct.  I should have been more explicit in that BTC would destroy what PayPal is today.
If PayPal is smart though (and this is a good start) they can find their own place in the Bitcoin space moving forward, leveraging their current resources appropriately and a well-known name.

I'm confident that BTC would have destroyed PayPal eventually.  They made a smart move here, and honestly made it earlier than I expected them to!
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:41:24
If that is the case, (I think you're about right, but if you're not right about this, we should be pretty close) reward halving around July 2016 should be **quite** significant in terms of price.

So much getting it right here.
Companies like Microsoft implementing payment methods accepting Bitcoin are a great sign (among many this year) that Bitcoin usage will grow and become much more mainstream over that kind of timeframe.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:30:58
There is something to be said that Microsoft did it by way of a blog instead of a big presser and announcement.
I think this news was relatively quiet outside of the Bitcoin space yesterday.  Saying that it is going viral seems appropriate when viewed in that light.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:07:17


The price is dropping now, but zooming out it's clearly still part of correcting from the massive upswing from $125 to over $1100 last year.
You are correct, though, in wanting to buy when it levels out.  I have a feeling quite a lot of money is waiting in the wings for that point - and then we start this crazy train up for another ride!
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:27:59


This is quite a bit different from a few months ago, and far different from one year+
When companies like Microsoft start accepting Bitcoin, like this, it's far easier for those that haven't really done any research to understand what it is just accept it instead of being blindly afraid of what they don't understand.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:42:18


I certainly hope it is, because it would be such a beneficial, and symbiotic relationship between a powerful firm and powerful technology - there is zero chance Apple and Applepay could hold a candle to the potential of BTC + MS

I didn't even realize that my statement would be read as BTC is the failing currency, sorry about that.
The price is down for the year, but it's still well above where it was last year and the infrastructure and usability is greatly improved.  Anyone claiming BTC is failing hasn't been paying attention, IMO.

They'll just be that much further behind the curve.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:03:41


I agree with you, although I am certainly fascinated to watch the cycles of reception through media to Bitcoin as it goes along.  That subtle sway from unknown -&gt; dismissive -&gt; fearful with little knowledge -&gt; fringe acceptance and positive news -&gt; insightful topics about potential.
Seeing that cycle now starting to happen at some of the bigger media outlets (WSJ most recently in my mind) compared to where this news was coming from last year, the year before, and prior to that is very cool
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:02:37
Just bought when it was under $200.  Very exciting times!

This.  Also, given the sheer ridiculousness of the rallies/bubbles before, I wouldn't be surprised to see a crazy ATH in the *tenfold* realm either.

For those that have access to Coinbase, I would argue that they have made significant improvements in the *simple and user friendly* side of BTC usability in the last year and a half.
There's plenty more room, sure, but they are doing great work for the ecosystem, IMO.

Microsoft is allowing BTC purchases...

How can you infer through a single picture of a 10 BTC purchase that OP has or has not read up about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:35:52
$1 -&gt; $31
$13 -&gt; $266
$100 -&gt; $1250
$200 -&gt; ?
I'm not saying it will, but if Bitcoin continues to grow and find success, its resilience and the prior speculative nature of it when it was relatively unknown leads me to believe it to be a strong possibility.
Just don't go dying before 36 or so!
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:43:11
I think the process prior to the purchase needs some work, yes - but the actual merchant adoption seems relatively straightforward.

Can't wait to see what happens at 21:00 UTC.
The Bitcoin world is pretty exciting on a regular basis! Very happy with how this was handled so far compared to the early Gox crashes.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:14:13


The experience definitely helps.  A lot of people are pointing to the Bitstamp thing as *bad news* - and don't get me wrong, it was a bad thing, and suddenly a lot of coins were on the market in someone's hands who was probably just trying to dump them quickly - but the way it was all handled was leaps and bounds better than the Gox crashes of a year and a half ago.  Seeing the way the market reacted showed increased maturity, and personally having seen both and some of the other craziness that had come before gave me a ton of comfort (and allowed me to feel more confident about the fundamentals) that unfortunately people who bought in on the way up last winter would not have.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:49:11
Thanks for your service, fellow Bitcoiner!
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:48:55
This is very true - it's funny because that same exact thought process has happened for people again and again through every Bitcoin price cycle.
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:34:34
If they want to remain average, then that's fine.  A little bit of reading and diversification of assets could go a long, long way to coming out of a shitty financial situation in a non-terrible position.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:58:18
There are idiots in every comment section on sites like this. It makes me feel better knowing they will continue missing the point until it's too late. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:53:45
What in the actual fuck are you talking about?
BTC was $125 last September and is $336 today.
Do you want to go back further than 1 1/12 of a year? We can do that too.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:59:17


I think more along these lines now.  Early on I thought that it could be, but by now I think the wealthy are becoming aware of it and (if BTC continues to grow) will make their moves early - solidifying not only Bitcoin, but their own relative position of wealth in the process.

I really don't try to convince anyone on Bitcoin. I tell them to read the white paper, pay attention, and decide on their own. 
I heard people try to convince me back in 2011. I didn't really get it until I learned it myself. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:59:26


This is one of the key points in the article to me, which represents one of the biggest positives that BIT and Winklevoss' funds will be able to offer.
Getting people like my Dad to go on coinbase and buy BTC then worry about him holding it is a procedure fraught with potential for fuckups.
Giving him the option to put 1% of his retirement portfolio into Bitcoin through a trust or fund is *much* easier, and he could actually probably do it all himself, without any assistance from me.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:13:49
I'm happy to use Coinbase because I am comfortable with 2FA and have ample security on my email. 
I wouldn't have the same confidence in any of that on someone like my Dad's PC

Makes me excited for the future given the general shift in favor of BTC over the last year, and significantly so in the last few months.

Hmmm... trying to understand, I might be a bit confused by the later part of your post, but I wasn't trying to say that the value right now has an effect on everyday people.
All I'm saying is that whether Bitcoin is $1/10/100/1,000/10,000 right now, it's not quite ready for mainstream usage.
I do think that if the issues making mainstream usage difficult currently are resolved, (as they have been steadily improving over time) the value of Bitcoin will go up, simply because of a limited supply and vastly increased demand created from ease of use and security accessibility.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:57:52
Nice article and I do agree with him that Bitcoin still isn't ready for


I wouldn't want any of my parents/aunts/uncles/and lots of people in my peer group trying to buy and secure any amount of BTC &gt;$100 on their own right now.
All of this is why I also feel that it's accurately valued ~$1000, and when infrastructure improves accessibility and security, there is a ton of room for growth.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:09:15
You could very well be right, and that would be my hope - again my perspective could be way off for what it looks like for a newcomer.  
It's that first part of real learning you did about BTC that I'm not convinced people would do.  Most of that comes from the conversations I've had with people I know about Bitcoin.  Hearing some of the questions asked makes me terrified to think they would try to hold any amount of money in BTC.
If they did their own learning and took the time to understand, I would feel a lot better about it!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:16:09


I disagree with this.
While it isn't true for all people with a large number of wealth - *most* of them have gotten to that point because they are good/smart/careful about accumulating **more** wealth.
This does not mean they go around throwing money into places and say to themselves: "If it vanishes... oh well"
1%,5%,10%,50% to a billionaire means just as much relatively to them as that percentage does to the average joe.  The difference is the billionaire is probably better at managing what he does with it, just due to experience.
I agree with you that average joe putting money in Bitcoin is a huge indicator as well, but will certainly not be discounting what big players are doing - especially not this early in the game.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:47:26


I hear you loud and clear.  As much as I love sites like Coinbase, though, I do not feel comfortable keeping very much money on there, or anywhere really that isn't under my complete control.
I work in the tech sector, and would think that most people in that field can probably do the one/two week plan you mentioned and be close to up to speed, at least enough to securely hold their own BTC.
Most people, though, I think would not fully grasp in that short period of understanding BTC that Coinbase *is not* a bank.  There's no familiar protections there that banks offer (and the consumer pays for).  
Most people know and understand how to use an ATM, and the importance of their ATM card and PIN.  I don't think that level of basic knowledge doesn't similarly include the importance of two-factor authentication at a most basic level, and certainly wouldn't include the importance of cold storage and the security precautions that come with that.
I've been in the Bitcoin space for a while now and seen plenty of stories of just how easy it is to lose BTC.  I've also seen way too many stories of non-technical peers of mine "getting their facebook hacked" to feel incredibly uncomfortable with knowing they would be trying to keep much money at all in Bitcoin right now.
