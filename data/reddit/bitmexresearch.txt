I think it is true that the system works better if the total channel capacity is far larger than the amounts being spent.  However, I do not think the end user making the payment also needs such liquidity in their channel to the network.  For instance, if the overall network has high capacity and a user has $1,000 in their channel, they should be able to reliably spend $1,000.

Thanks for your kind words.  We really appreciate the feedback.

True.  But hopefully it sparks a healthy debate

What I mean is the following:
* One entity controls 51% of the hashrate
* This entity opens an LN channel with you
* They then perform a hostile redemption transction
* The miners then do a censorship softfork, by refusing to build on blocks that contain the response redemption transaction
* The redemption period ends
* Since the miner has a majority hashrate, they make the most work chain
* The miner then steals your funds

Thanks for your feedback.  We have written other pieces on these various topics.  For example Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold:
* [Bitcoin Cash: Potential Price Implications of Investment Flow Data](
* [Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Investment flow data (update)](
* [Bitcoin Gold (BTG) – Investment flow data](
As for a complete list of tokens which have split off from Bitcoin's UTXO in some way, we plan on doing such a list in the future.

Yes, just randomly. We think that P2P stuff is the largest contributor to the variance
Do you think it's a good idea to try this again, but only rescanning the already downloaded blockchain? Then variances may be lower

Jameson Loop has done reports on this

Can we use the same servers for all versions of Core? Or do we need to run older versions so that older versions of Bitcoin connect to it?

The data in our charts only counts transactions with SegWit inputs as SegWit. We did not look where the output went
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:23:24
Ok thanks
We will consider producing charts of these things going forwards

Yes, it is fair to say that. However, please make sure you read the Puerto Rico section in our main report into Tether, to understand the context behind some of the assumptions and speculation:
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:19:51
I guess you are mostly correct here.  It is just potentially interesting data to show, which might have some relationship with Bitcoin mining.  On the other hand it might not.
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:02:01


Yes.  I think this is a good point.  It is true that Bitcoin mining uses a lot of power, however the financial incentives are to locate mines where power is cheapest and most stable.  The piece compares this with aluminium smelting, which is somewhat similar.
As for carbon emissions.  Carbon emitting power sources require the purchase of fossil fuels for each unit of power produced.  In contrast other less carbon intensive power sources such a nuclear, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal, tend to have high upfront investment costs, but the marginal cost of producing power can be quite low compared to carbon emitting sources.  This could make them more suitable for Bitcoin mining.  Therefore Bitcoin mining could be far more environmentally friendly than one may think.

But how can we tell if the output can be redeemed by segregating the witness or not?

Please see our latest piece. This includes one more data point of IFE aggregate deposits, which was released over the weekend:
Although the article is still highly speculative
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:11:51
Good point 
But if batteries are expensive, do the mines switch off at night?  This could cause lower utilization rates for mining equipment and daily hashrate cycles.  Confirmation times could increase during the night where the solar mines are located 
The good thing about hydro is it's reasonably reliable and constant  
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:02:46
Pehaps.  I think you may be mostly correct here.
Although as the report suggests, some  of this hydropower is captive to aluminium production.  Other than that, there is limited other local power demand, in some circumstances.  If aluminium prices fall, such that the facility is loss making, there may not be many alternative uses for the power.  Therefore the opportunity cost could be low 
As the piece says.  In the 2014 to 2015 period, aluminium prices were weak and China's largest aluminium producers were loss making.  (At least without government grants)
Source: 
The distribution of good, low cost power resources are not necessarily geographically  distributed on earth in the same way the population is distributed.  There is limited power demand away from population centres

SegWit is both a softfork AND opt-in. The fact that using the new transaction format is optional, is not a direct result of SegWit being a softfork. If SegWit was made compulsory, it still could have been a softfork. Alternatively, if the witness commitment went into the block header such that SegWit was made into a hardfork, the new transaction format could still have remained optional. 
But I still see your general point
