Saying Satoshi is anonymous gives undue weight to government endorsement of names, and government-issued 'certificates'. His name and identity is just as legitimate as anyone else's. No, bitcoin wasn't authored anonymously. We *know* who created it - Satoshi did.

Yes, unfortunately when I've been googling for "verify coleman tool" these are the only results I can find - verifying that the tool is an 'official copy'.
But what I want to do, is verify that the 'official copy' works.

No, he's not. His identity is known. His identity is Satoshi. Anonymity has nothing to do with governments or their endorsements and rubber-stamping of identities to record them all in a government database.

Be very careful about non-Bitcoin currencies claiming to be "The Real Bitcoin^TM ". 
Bitcoin uses ticker symbol BTC on exchanges.
There are some very fraudulent websites out there, some with very legitimate-looking .com domains.

~~This is probably the path that I'm most after - however I'm having trouble finding practical equivalents to Coleman's tool, to check it against.~~
~~Most links on the web seem to just refer back to the exact same code.~~
Sorry, I misread the 'multisignature' part.
I agree about Bitcoin Core - that may be the way to go for me.  The path I'd like to take is to make my own entropy (via a coin), generate a seed list from that, but then verify that tools i'm using generate all the correct addresses from that seed.

He means your "seed phrase" which is usually 12 or 24 words, but before standardization (google "bip39"), seed phrases could be just about any words, any amount of them. i.e. you may have had a seed phrase with 17 random words in it, none of which come from the standard list of 2048 words people use these days (again, from the bip39 proposal).
