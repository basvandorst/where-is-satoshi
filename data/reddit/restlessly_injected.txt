LOL. The fed won't even tell members of congress the reasoning behind decisions.

If quantum computer already exists then why does the guy in this video (who seems to be some sort of expert) say we don't know whether its possible in practice: 
Also, are you saying quantum resistant cryptographic algorithm will be implemented by bitcoin (and the other current cryptos), or will different cryptos come along which incorporate  quantum resistant cryptographic algorithm for the get go.

If quantum computing came into existence would bitcoin be 'hackable' and consequently worthless?

will LN result in more centralization?

Thanks. Very helpful.

Thanks, perfectly answered (just what I was looking for).
In your opinion, when do you think a workable version with someone opening a payment channel, come out? By July next year?

yes, VPS need drivers licence, birth certificate, passport, list of all addresses, list of all phone numbers, list of names of every person you have ever associated with in your entire life and your toilet schedule

can't blame you, before the first ice age i was part of a lost civilization near Göbekli Tepe and we were mining bitcoins on stone arches and everyday 100 billion BTC would go through me, even if I kept a small percentage i would have so much fiat now.

how do you feel about now? just wait see what happens of the next few days, you will feel the consequences.

I think its a good time to sell, enough profits - more than doubled for most of us. Withdraw into fiat now, wait for it to crash then reinvest it again.

i would be curious to try it out and see what percentage i get back. bitcoin mixers start at around 0.5% but they aren't anonymous at all.

did you draw that on iapd?

hedonism now &gt;&gt; long-term future

There is approximately a 0.0% chance of that happening in 2018.
EDIT: Why is anyone downvoting this? Do you really think Amazon, FUCKING AMAZON, is going to allow crypto payments in 2018? Are you fucking mental? Explain to me why you have downvoted my comment.

I assure you they own every amazon related url under the sun. Probably including like peodphile related amazon urls.

what do you mean? what does it mean that i will loose all my coins?
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:30:37
exactly! this is exactly what i was thinking. but besides this it would be the ultimate system.
