It is absolutely insane to let the current group of developers stop Bitcoin's adoption and network effect in order to take an unproven bet on Lightning. 
8MB blocks and then regular blocksize increases would have kept interest in Bitcoin high back in 2016. VC money would have continued to pour in, businesses would have continued to integrate. Merchants would have continued to adopt it for payments. I know, I was in the middle of it for the prior 6 years.
Scroll down and look at what happened to Bitcoin's market dominance: 
It never used to dip below 85%. 
Notice it tanked right when blocks started filling up? 
Bitcoin wasn't designed to have full blocks in 2016. 
 was designed to have full blocks in 2140.
Greg Maxwell, Blockstream, Chaincode labs/Lightning labs and more importantly the huge banks and insurance companies bankrolling them, have sabotaged Bitcoin.
But you are going to give them 5 more years?
That's just, insane.

Used to? Bitcoin was stopped cold by refusing to increase the max_block_size. Interest, adoption, investment in startups, they all fell off a cliff. Altcoins benefitted hugely. 
The only way any of this makes sense is that special interests want to divide and conquer cryptocurrency by stopping any one of them from gaining network effect by controlling and containing the top cryptocurrency, what was formerly Bitcoin.

Your previous suspicions were correct, and you are having a conversation with a bunch of paid shills, agents, and useful idiots.
