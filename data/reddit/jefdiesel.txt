I think farl4bit means NXT has the most potential. Top 5 marketcap, plenty of active devs, and a LOT of new features coming out.

Sergey is not BCNxt, or if he was, he'd be making some bigger plays. He is the founder of secureae.com and runs a tech VC firm. I've MET sergey twice, once at bitdevs, and a week later for a talk about NXT strategy in Madison Sq Park. Smart guy.

Nxt Asset Exchange is awesome. 
Roughly $30 to issue secure assets.  Plenty of assets there and some serious wealth being generated. Even synthetic BTC and BTCD.
Five or six of the assets are trading as BTC pairs on Poloniex, and Coinmarketcap is scraping data for their charts.

Sia occupies a new place in alts as it has actual utility. It offers a service, and a revenue stream for average joe. Don't worry about the price pumping, think about the millions of people that could be renting spare HD space, sharing files securely, and running a democratic network, outside the reach of the governments, and the corporations.
