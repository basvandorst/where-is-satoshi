Could someone who lives in say, Russia, who isn't concerned about legality, do this and have a meaningful impact on price?

My question isn't a legal one. Is it possible? Is it easily provable?

Sorry to do this but, ELI5 please. I understand Bitcoin better than  most, but am lost during this debate.

I don't follow, and I don't think a 5 year old would either.

It's been painful for me but I am trying to live by one central concept, if I don't understand something well, I won't put my money into it.

Thanks. Now, just between you and me, how many of the people investing in Bitcoin understand the mathematics behind it?
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:06:26
I now understand that the keys change with nearly infinite complexity to access a preexisting ledger, the totality of which has not yet been found. 
Now on to question two: How can Bitcoin avoid competition from other systems with equal or greater security/convienence/marketing/etc.? 
While it does seem unque, it doesn't seem any different than any other IOU/check/fiat in that the value is not intrinsic to the device. I have many checks in my possession, but they don't have value by themselves.

There is nothing I have that is digital, transferable, etc, that I cannot copy. What is a Bitcoin?

Thank you. Not sure why everyone is doing an ELI5 approach, but I understand now. I didn't understand the interconnected nature of mining and verification, if I understand it correctly. As well as "trapdoor" encryption. One way is easy math, backwards is nearly impossible.

Ok. What is the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:39:23
Ok. This I can work with. Where is the main program that controls this action located? Is it dispersed into many servers?  Can this main program be hacked? Pehaps by the original designer(s)?

If it is a long string of numbers and letters, you could make copies of that. If I transfer that to you and keep a copy for myself, I haven't really transfered anything unique to you. 
I'm sure there is a more complicated mathematical mechanism at work here, but I have never had it explained to me.
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:15:54
Still not a believer in a lasting (or ever increasing) value of Bitcoin, but I now understand the system at a more usable level.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:42:36
You say Bitcoin like it is a thing, what is it? I cannot envision a digital "thing" that cannot be duplicated. I know that it exists, I just haven't had it explained to me yet.
