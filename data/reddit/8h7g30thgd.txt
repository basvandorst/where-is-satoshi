You mean you need 120 million to destroy SHA-256 based proof of work. How much do you need to destroy ehtereum mining once it goes PoS?

The internet will stay as it is as long as the powers that watch over it don't overextend and oppress too many users. As soon as they do, the internet will mutate out of their control.

Actually the free market allows you to compete and get ahead to the best of your ability. If that leads to a monopoly, the free market don't care.

^ This person does not understand value investing.
Bitcoin is already less than 50% of the cryptoverse market cap, at it will only stay afloat as long as people trust the developers and as long as the network is protected from attack and continues to operate in a way that the users of the network deem satisfactory. This will only happen as long as it makes financial sense from the point of view of the opportunity cost of miners. All miners have a stake in the ecosystem, not just SHA256 miners. GPU mining affects the value of bitcoin and the rest of the altcoins. For years now it has been more profitable to mine altcoins and convert to BTC, thanks to asics. But this phenomenon also drives the value of mineable altcoins up. Other blockhains don't even rely on mining to hold value, instead they rely on so called 'Assets'.  
The promise of immutability by Bitcoin has 2 flaws, the first one is that the developer + miner community can coordinate to mutate history and concensus, the second one is that blockchains are Free Software, so we are free to make our own. Gold would be worthless if we could all make our own chemical elements with whatever material properties we wanted. The value of gold relies on the prohibitive energy cost of transmuting one heavy metal element into another (only a supernova can achieve this), combined with the cost of extracting an increasingly rare material from the ground. Similarily the value of the crypto ecosystem as a whole boils down to energy consumption. Longer blockchains are akin to heavier elements with more immutability, while useful features in blockhains are akin to favorable material properties, like high electrical conductivity. 
The instantaneous energy cost of mining a particular chain can cause problems. Imagine if your ability to trade gold coins in the intergalactic exchange was directly related to how much energy is being spent on mining gold on the whole planet where the coin originated from, and that if someone in the galaxy could spend enough energy to match the energy spent by mines on that planet, then they could double spend any gold from that planet. Then imagine miners can just teleport to a brand new planet with more abundant materials. As soon as materials from the new planet become more profitable to mine, and the miners abandon ship, the minerals in the first planet will become double spendable.
I much rather put my money on a GPU mining operation than buy and hold any crypto.
Go tell Vitalik how stupid he is for making a 4 billion dollar facebook clone. Or the Litecoin or Dogecoin community. Coins will come and go, and there won't ever be one coin to rule them all. Natural selection is at work here, and lack of adaptation will lead to extinction.

Well, it IS a market. It seems like communism might fit your pet definition of a free market better.

TIL. From now on I can correct this horrendous mistake more accurately.

It's just a commodity. You can't base your financial future on holding gold, unless you do so as a hedge in smaller quantities. You're better off buying farmland or businesses in the long run. Bitcoin will have to innovate continuously in a sink-or-swim cryptocurrency war, because most of the coins have already been mined and thus there is a big incentive for newcomers to start over on a new blockchain where value can be extracted though mining oeprations rather than speculative holding.

It's not a productive asset, just a speculative one.

What if they actually invented blokchains and they knew in advance that they would be able to subvert them, so they invented Satoshi Nakamoto to keep all cryptoanarchists and cypherpunks working on vaporware? /s
