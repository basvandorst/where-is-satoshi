That's what people outside of finance think.  The future is blurry but it's sometimes easy to make out shapes
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:04:21
There are several people doing this already.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:43:44
As a citizen and human sure, but as a company they have to do that so they can stay in business.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:18:45
Probably not anymore.  They were once but it's always been super buggy
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:44:26
This sub tbh..
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:09:02
Probably worth 2-3x the value of a btc..
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:04:37
No, that would make OP *much much* poorer.. Those physical coins are worth *WAY* more than 1k each now that they are super-rare because the original maker was forced to stop.

Gold was outlawed in the USA for 30 years.  People are worried the same will happen with bitcoin.  It's entirely possible the government will do that to avoid a devaluing event of the USD.  Thus, holding it personally, you could move to another country and use them.

Yeah bitstamp has about the same market share as coinbase, btce, finex and btcchina and kraken.  It's pretty spread out which is super healthy and ensures a more accurate price.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:37:19
yeah but "this time it's different"
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:27:33
You are next level smelling your own farts

* Your bitcoins -&gt; frozen address
* Altcoins dispensed to you
* Return said altcoins -&gt; your bitcoins automatically unfrozen and sent to your specified address
If you don't have the altcoins returned to specified address in certain time the other party keeps your bitcoins
All this done automatically on the blockchain and timestamped and cryptographically verified so you can't cheat.

Yes, we are all one person!  Generalize even further!
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:59:56
Bitcoin is the first global currency.. are you serious?  Those are just alt-right propaganda buzzwords you aren't even paying attention.
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:30:49
Like saying you aren't using the internet because you aren't running a website on your own server..  totally misleading
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:47:13
This dude was making physical bitcoins out of his garage when they were $5 you really need to read and learn about how legit the casacius guy is
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:23:14
So if I place a market order on GDAX (using my normal coinbase login) I will be able to buy Bitcoin with lower fees?
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:29:28
They have to be talking about exchange wallets right?  Or I guess they could be talking about security (ie for noobs who might lose their priv key if using local wallet)
Otherwise they're being facetious about open source wallets
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:35:10
Oh I see.  It's like any other stock brokerage then.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:11:40
Those are worth *way way* more than spot price. 2-3x more.
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:23:18
This isn't about the economy.  This is about banks laundering billions through "investments" then asking the government for more.

Think of Bitcoin like email except rare. You send bitcoins between addresses.  A wallet holds many addresses which when added up equal your total Bitcoin amount.
Just like with email you can create copies of your addresses and their passwords (public and private keys) and store them as "backups" in case your computer or phone gets lost or broken.
Emails don't disappear when your computer breaks and same with bitcoins.  If you have the address and password you can access them from any computer.

Didn't know that Gemini had less fees.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:10:13
That's gonna be worth a retirement in 20 years.  I wish I was joking.  You're doing a smart thing.  Maybe find a deposit box for it at a large bank.  Will insure it against theft/damage/loss

Go for CoPay.  Open source, beautiful UI, You control the keys.
@_date: 2017-01-31 06:46:25
Airbitz is ugly as hell.  Copay and breadwallet are much better.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:23:19
Yeah, sounds like a fun toy for experimenting/learning the intricacies of Bitcoin networking/relaying. Pretty sure they made it plug-and-play for semi-noobs.

That miner could maybe get you a few cents every month if you hook it up to a mining pool.  Besides that it's basically just a node (which is still cool though!)
Dunno about those others things you're talking about, but I guess you could charge money for your node to relay specific transactions faster or something.
