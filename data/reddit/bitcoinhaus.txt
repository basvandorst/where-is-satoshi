WOW...... Terrific !!!!!
10 years of development in the tech community, a lifetime for development, and still only 5 transactions per second. :(
WHEN SPEED ?

When is BTC going to get some scale-ability improvements?
Lightning is the carrot on the stick, always just out of reach.  Is there anything else that can make BTC faster in the next 3 months?

What is the meaning of this?, and what is the significance?

I can't even find a Millennial who knows what Bitcoin is.

Another reason Bitcoin will never be for the masses.

So Tru. If I find myself in a conversation with a millennial, I make it a habit to bring up BTC. I am still amazed at how few actually have heard of Bitcoin, let alone have any basic understanding of its purpose. Very disappointing.

10 years later and still cannot get past 5 transactions per second without the use of ever more complicated layers that will only further alienate the masses..... Make it simple, make it usable. WHEN ???

Well.... at least Bitcoin is good for something.

Terrific, you now own your own version of a Legends of Zelda Limited Edition Sword. Put it on a paper wallet and frame it. At least that way you can get some value out of it.
When Faster Transactions?
