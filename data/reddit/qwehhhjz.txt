Ban on national level the internet traffic to/from btc nodes ip addresses, or just for a person specifically

People is talking about chinese speculating but probably they understood how well traceable bitcoin is.  
The world needs more xmr and less btc i guess

Same, but I live in Italy lol  
There is a city in Lombardia which was famous for having bitcoin pretty spread around, but I think now it got less popular already.

What? If the governments decide to ban you from accessing the bitcoin chain, it will be easy for them to do so.  
Someone can avoid it with some technical trick, but that's not for everyone and also if they see your funds moving (because btc is fucking transparent unlike monero) they can just arrest you, lol.

Btc isn't a great currency if you want to transfer money anonymously.

The answer to the first part is the second part

It works on lightining network.  
It's a system designed for moving btc faster and with way less fees
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:53:20
Yes, except that btc is so easily traceable that if there was mass adoptions governments would actually be crazy for it...  
Monero is what bitcoin was meant to be, lol.
@_date: 2019-04-19 08:56:15
This but with Monero

ETH shitcoin!? Are you here to cheer your team like in a fucking stadium or to talk seriously about new smart technologies
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:53:12
Nice. Did you get the stickers somewhere online? I'm looking to do the same for my activity
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:50:06
Yeah. If Bitcoin updated its tech to Nano's one it would be awesome, but I think people nowadays just want btc to be a store of value for speculation rather than using it as real currency, lol

To the people who keep machines running the network (miners)
