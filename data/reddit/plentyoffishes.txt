Ok I understand now. What's your take on Paul's economic ideas?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:54:32
The government hasn't been run by "the people" for ages. Do you really think they have your best interest at heart, and there's some perfect combination of people running it that will make sure it is not corruptible?
Obama didn't stop lobbyists at all. The lobby/bribery was still alive and well at the end of his administration.
Yes, currently we are living in a system of crony capitalism, where the big guys buy government favoritism and get unfair advantages in the market.
The government takes the bribes and allows these monopolies to happen.
They do not "stand in the way" of monopolies, but actually create them.
Without the government, how would these businesses force you to buy their stuff?
How would a business (not a connected corp) force you to do anything? They wouldn't, they would simply go out of business if they tried to force you to buy things or if they provided a crappy product.
The problem you described, "big money" and "idiots allowed to vote" both go hand in hand with democracy and government in general. "Voting" in the free market is done with your wallet, so idiots don't matter. "Big Money" can't do much if they don't have "authorities" to bribe.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:12:10


This is not an argument.


What does this mean?


Who's not allowing it? Who's losing money? If there is a demand in the marketplace, business people will rush in to fill that demand, because there is profit to be made.


What I'm talking about is actually based on people's desire for profit.
What you are dreaming of is some benevolent, un-corruptible government. That can never happen.


What do you think lobbying is? What happens when a corporation hires someone to give money to politicians? How are those politicians stopping or slowing down corporations?


Better? How? You said yourself that idiots are allowed to vote. And you have this army of politicians currently accepting bribes and playing favorites in the market. How do you fix it with new politicians? Your argument fails here, you can't have it all ways. How is it that "people are greedy" but somehow, there are some politicians out there who are not greedy or able to be corrupted?

@_date: 2018-01-16 17:20:04
you're spouting off a lot of incorrect info about Paul:
-agree that public schools are a disaster and we should not be extorted to pay for them. 
-what has the dept of education done specifically to benefit people?
-laws don't stop people from discriminating. the market does.
-what does religious belief have to do with economics?
-wrong. Paul had never been for unifying church and state nor has he made claims of what the founds envisioned in regards to religion.
-the debt that politicians created? How is that my debt?
EDIT: I said "incorrect info", meant to say "incorrect or unproven"
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:25:47

@_date: 2018-01-16 19:05:52
No, again, the discussion was on economics. No one has to do anything, but to claim that I moved goal posts is disingenuous. I'm trying to stick to apples-apples here.
Let's use a hypothetical example.
If someone says "Andre Agassi was a great tennis player"
And someone else responds with "Great? How can you call him great when he clearly was an egomaniac who believes in the tooth fairy?"
That is a completely different thing. The first person wasn't commenting or even attempting to comment on Agassi's ego or beliefs. He was simply discussing tennis.
This is what happened here. The discussion was about Ron Paul's points on bitcoin/the economy and then the move to his Christianity.
It has nothing to do with bitcoin or economics. That's the point I'm trying to make.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:31:57

@_date: 2018-01-16 15:56:46

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:56
No this is the original title, right on top of the page! "Ron Paul: 'Bitcoin Should Be Legal, as Long as There's No Fraud' - “I abhor the system that we have. The official counterfeiters are at the Federal Reserve. That is a big misstep and a big problem. So people should have the right to choose,”
"Coo Coo" was in the comments, not the original topic. Again, I'd like to know what is coo coo about his economics, not his religious beliefs.

I thought we were talking about the economy. Seems you are trying to create a straw man here. Which economic beliefs of Paul do you think are "stupid as fuck"? Let's break it down.
I don't agree with him on creationism, nor was this part of the discussion so I don't see the need to debate that here.

Oh hahaha yes it is. Reddit is really a horrible place to engage in a debate because of this type of thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:26:57
The original discussion was about the economy. 
I don't care to discuss religious beliefs, the economy doesn't care about what people's religion tells them.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:59:43
Right but the claim was that I was moving goalposts. If anything, the comment on his religious beliefs was teh move in goal posts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:55:24
I never said that it was just war. And I wasn't posing an argument.

I like it. But let's look at root causes of PTSD. Many suffer from this because of being in a war. Killing people, being shot at, and having friends die around you is not natural for humans. How can we stop the unnecessary wars? I guess simply supporting bitcoin is one way.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:45:28
So shouldn't the price be booming now because of his new comments or is his credibility completely shot now?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:24:54
We kind of agree on your first point. I'd be happy if we had a system where some states offer say, socialized health care, and other states offered free market health care. So we could even pit the free market agains socialism and see what happens. But currently, this country is not about freedom.
The problem with asking for government to regulate corporations is that it always leads to more corruption. If you give politicians or "regulators" power, they will be corrupted by the lobby money flowing into DC, and therefore end up in bed with the very corporations they were supposed to regulate. 
It's not an answer because we have the problem of human corruptibility leading to market favoratism, and blurred line between corps and gov, which is never going to result in fairness, more choices, or lower prices.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:36:51
Yeah he only regrets saying bitcoin is a fraud because the price boomed a few days after he said it, now he looks foolish. However, he still hates it and wants it to go away, muh blockchain.

Jesus he said that? Do you know which video this was?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:45:31


How? Ultimate power corrupts ultimately.


Huh? If the government were never involved in the first place, it wouldn't have to "break up" Bell.


How do they "be monopolies" in a free market without the ability to bribe government?


You got part of it right. By "we allow" means government creates. It actually does completely go away if we get the freedom to choose. Why would you keep buying from a big company if they provided crappy products? In a free market, you simply vote with your wallet. An entrepreneur will gladly fill in the gaps and compete with crappy bloated companies, but the market has to be free- so these companies aren't government-connected corporations.


And you can simply not shop at this company. Again, if this company isn't serving the market, an entrepreneur will step in and gladly serve that part of the market and take your money. We don't need government's "help" to make this happen.


"Government regulation" just means they will help the businesses who bribe them. Regulators are easily corruptible. In a free market, you don't have anyone to bribe. You have to make a good product or service, or you die. This is the only way to truly regulate the market.


Why not? Because you'd rather have a corrupt system with bribes and kickbacks?


I agree, but not with government regulators who instantly become corrupt by lobbyist (bribe) money. Let the market take care of crappy bloated business by simply not shopping there.


Brainwashed? Right. This is what our public schools do, and they are certainly not teaching free market principles! "Big Money" can only be stopped by allowing natural competition in the market. More government regulation means pure crony capitalism, and it just gets worse from what we have today.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:51:41
How can they find these individuals if they are anonymous? This new regulation just seems like writing on paper and nothing more.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:45:16

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:35:57

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:16:51


And many of these people end up in politics/government, and you've got corrupt people ruling us. This is why government appointed regulators is not the answer. Unless you are suggesting that government bureaucrats are somehow above corruptibility?
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:12:08
I've got a couple:
SENS: Let's extend life. I know some people do not want to live longer than 80 or so years. But let's give people the chance, if they want to, to live well past 100 and into their 200s and 300s. Life is fun! Why accept that it has to end after 80 or so years? That is such a small period of time.
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF): We need more freedom online. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:11:55
Yeah I'm not concerned with "most" libertarians. Glenn Beck used to call himself libertarian yet had 0 libertarian beliefs. It's just a label.
I think you are mixing up capitalism with what we have- crony capitalism. They are actually the complete opposite. Free market capitalism would give us the natural regulations that most people want. The connected corporations would no longer be connected and would have to earn their business instead of bribe their way into a monopoly.
Socialism would lead to the government running more industry, created less competition, fewer choices, and higher prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:33:27
He later calls it "BITCOIN CRYPTO". No joke.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:39:33


You mean like the government does to us all the time on a daily basis? How exactly would a business be able to fuck people over consistently and still keep their business (if not for our current crony capitalism)?
Yes, critical thinking is hard for many. As if government bureaucrats are immune to greed and corruption.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:43:48
Well many are panic selling...
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:58:50
Are you actually in bitcoin? Do you realize the whole premise of bitcoin is a decentralized currency? If you're pro-centralization, why not just keep your money in centralized US dollars.
Since you're for centralization and I'm for decentralization, we will never agree.
You want to somehow come up with a benevolent government that is not corruptible.
I see this as impossible and would like to see a system where there is nobody to bribe to get ahead in business.

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:41
I didn't mean to say it was ALL incorrect, but some was definitely incorrect. I'll go through it:
-Thanks for the link. I agree with Paul on this one, setting up laws against harassment doesn't stop it. 
-This one, I asked a question. What benefits does the dept of education provide? I got no answer.
-Great, I'm also for getting the government out of the business of owning land. Thanks for the link.
-RP said his religious beliefs would have no bearing on his presidency  This is relevant to the original discussion of free market economics, not what he thinks the founding fathers wanted or didn't want.
-Thanks for the link on defaulting on debt. I didn't say it was incorrect or that I agree or disagree. Just asked for a link.
Also asked what religious views have to do with economics, and how politicians running up a $21T debt is my debt. 
Mainly, I want to stick to economic discussions in regards to Paul. He may believe in spaghetti monsters and fuck donkeys in his spare time, but the discussion is in regards to bitcoin and economics.

No that's not what we have. There is plenty of real, concrete proof of the mass pollution governments do all the time. I can give you links, but I don't think that will help.


You are conveniently switching the topic here from governments polluting up the atmosphere to governments solving the ozone layer. That's an interesting debate, but doesn't dispute my point. It's like saying, look, the mafia saved some lives over here, so the mafia should be in charge of national security.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:07:28
I've already shown you how governments pollute the planet. You won't accept that. Proof that governments banning one thing solved the ozone layer? No, I don't believe this, but we're skipping the main, underlying fact that this group is damaging the environment, so why should we trust them to clean it up?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:55
Laws are the problem. Laws are just opinions backed by guns. Laws actually do not stop murders or even slow down their rate. People aren't holding back from killing others because it's illegal. And when was the last time you heard of a cop stopping a murder before it happened?

You're right. China is even *worse* than the US government when it comes to pollution!
For starters, I would not have the biggest polluters in the world in charge of cleaning up the environment. That doesn't work.
I would eliminate all regulations around self driving cars, so we can have far less cars &amp; pollution on the roads.
I would let entrepreners figure out how to solve traffic in the mean time. Government has been in charge of roads for a really long time, and they're doing a horrible job of it. Traffic just gets worse, leading to more pollution.
I would ban leaf blowers (my one law), which would also eliminate noise pollution. ;)

You can't live in or eat your fiat either. For now you can trade your bitcoin for fiat and pay for your rent and food. I don't consider that "cashing out". Cashing out implies that fiat is "real money" and bitcoin is simply "an investment". Someday soon, you will be able to spend your bitcoin on all kinds of things, including basic necessities.

Your ad hominem attack on libertarians is not an argument.

Government is in bed with Exxon. Regulations make it more likely that government will give favoratism to a business.

Again, that's not the debate, even though you're trying to steer it that way. Can governments get together and ban things that lead to less pollution? Yes. Does that mean they are qualified to clean up the environment? No. If they are polluting the shit out of the earth on one hand and clean it up on the other hand, this just proves how horrible they are at managing the environment.
And no, I'm still not answering your question, I don't have time to go into deep research on the ozone layer and all the possibilities of what caused it and what fixed it.

No I don't think wearing a robe or a badge makes one more qualified to decided what is hairbrained and what isn't. Just because the current system says that people must get extorted out of their money for society to survive, doesn't mean it's a rational or non-hairbrained one. In fact, the average human working outside of the governmental system is likely better qualified to answer this without bias.
The ratification argument has been tried and failed in courts numerous times, so I doubt that's her argument. If she's a voluntarist, she likely believes that sanctioned theft or extortion is simply not a healthy way to run a society.
Nope I'm not MF. :)

You're assuming we need a bureaucratic body to make decisions for us. I don't assume or agree with that idea.


Corporations are just branches of government. In order to form a corporation, you must submit to and partner up with the government. So without government, the internet would be much more free and open- nobody could just grant these corporations a monopoly on the market like the government does. With a Net Neutrality law, you are simply saying "we trust the government to make the internet neutral." To me that is no different than saying you trust corporations to make the internet neutral. 


Perfection? No. We don't even have a semblance of a peaceful, prosperous system where the most amount of people benefit. Voting and 50%+1 majority rules doesn't work. Neither does handing "representation" off to those who are bought and paid for. Politicians have always stood in the way of progress and that is not changing anytime soon. So no, I won't be voting for either "side", which is anti-progress.


All those were accomplished by men. We don't need government to build roads, men have figured out how to do that. You're confusing the idea that we need to have an organization that runs things with threats of violence in order to have a society. We don't. We can figure things out ourselves without overlords or voting (which can also be called a suggestion box for slaves, since politicians rarely even carry out what voters want).


Says you. Decentralization works in every area. Hierarchies are not necessary, they are just what we have come to know.


Full faith and credit? What does that mean? The same organization who is $21 trillion in debt? Do you really put faith in them? And, this is the problem bitcoin solves. A centralized system created the federal reserve, which prints money and takes it out of your and my bank accounts. Bitcoin's major asset is it is a decentralized currency. I'm surprised you haven't read about this central tenant of bitcoin, and are still clinging to the idea that fiat currencies will be around forever because faith.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:52:36
Government doesn't build roads, they pay others to do so. We don't need military, especially in its current aggressive form. We don't need institutionalized theft, despite what your schooling told you.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:54:38
All of that could easily be done without pointing guns at people to make them pay. In fact, recalls are usually done at the level of business- the FDA, USDA, etc, usually do more harm than good. We don't need them, and we can easily pay for the things we use without the middleman of government taking their cut via force.

Roads and other necessities could easily, and less expensively, be funded without taxes. Without stealing people's money we could have nice roads, and even better, no more wars. Taxes are not "dues" they are all about extortion and control.

@_date: 2018-05-21 17:05:14


Nope, it makes much more sense than supporting the blue or red team. I do not believe the government should be making moral decisions for me, nor what I do with my body. If not for the government, we wouldn't need laws to protect neutrality! The government grants these corporations monopolies in the marketplace. They broke it, now you're telling me we need them to fix it? No, just get out of the way and let freedom work.


The opposite of true. It's lazy thinking to say that one party is going to fix the problems, when both parties have been causing the problems for many decades.
ACA is a total and complete disaster, which is why we now have private, free market alternatives to health care popping up to fix the problem that government can't and won't solve.
No, sticking your head in the dirt is not pretend that government is actually solving problems and actually doing good in the world, and ignoring all the damage, destruction, and unintended consequences. 
I'm not going to throw my support into a domination system that has been failing people since its inception.
We can do much, much better as a society than these antiquated, top-down hierarchical structures that serve nobody but maybe a few in power.
Decentralization and bitcoin are a nice start. Hierarchies are going to die anyway, might as well stop clinging to these old structures and systems and get on board with a decentralized world now.

Actually this has worked at 3 different CVS's and a Rite Aid so far. You can buy the Prepaid Visas with a CC, but NOT the Reload cards. 
The cost of the card is $4.95. So you're paying about 1%. Money orders are about a buck. So slightly over 1% overall. These are certainly not cash advances so and I pay them right away. No chance that getting 500 extra points isn't worth $6! I would buy 500 points for 6 bucks every day of the week. A plane ticket across the country is around 12,500 points, so I'm getting this flight for $115, for example.

“With that respect the results were disappointing. Basic income recipients did not have more work days or higher incomes than those in the control group. Despite the fact that basic income recipients had clearly better incentives to work, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The results show that among the young and the long-term unemployed other obstacles for work, such as outdated skills and health issues, are more important than financial incentives.”

My point was that if someone makes $60k a year and saves 10% every year, they never come close to a million dollars, yet, they got by just fine in life. 
A million over the course of a lifetime isn't HUGE money, but it's more than most will ever earn. A million all at once or within a few years IS big money, and you can yes, retire off of it, unless you just like blowing money on expensive houses and boats and things like that.

Your scenario could never hold up in a court if someone were trying to prove that this person owned x amount of bitcoin without a shadow of a doubt. Again, bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, and you could be traced but if you do just a few things, it can be completely anonymous.

No I did not move the goal posts. Adding to the conversation isn't moving goal posts. I was always asking about showing how bitcoin is not anonymous. You still haven't shown this. Please re-read my original post- I was asking for anyone to show me where any of the top bitcoin addresses have been tracked to an individual.
They haven't, because those addresses have all remained anonymous.
Yes, if you simply buy coins on an exchange and spend them online where you give your identity, they are trackable to your name.
If you take a few easy precautions that we have covered, it is not traceable, and is anonymous. This is not because bitcoin itself is not anonymous and you did something. It's the other way around.
It's anonymous until you make it not anonymous (by buying on a centralized exchange, etc.)
If you buy coins from an individual, and spend them with another individual offline, it is anonymous. Nobody besides you and the buyer and seller know your identity. No one could show where your coins have gone, or how many you have.
That's anonymous.
The reason we say pseudonymous is because most people buy their coins on places like Coinbase that make you give up your identity. But that's not a function of bitcoin itself.
Yes of course Mimblewimble is not bitcoin itself. But that doesn't show that bitcoin is not anonymous either.

Coins could have been lost or stolen, private key may have been lost, there are many plausible scenarios that you would not be able to prove who owns those coins- even in the case that the individual was buying things online and entering their name. How are you going to prove the coins belong to that person? Even if you supposedly have evidence, he can easily deny it and you can't prove him wrong. "You didn't lose them!" Right.

No it isn't, not by far. Most people use credit cards or debit cards which are linked to their name. People who buy bitcoin anonymously cannot be traced by simply taking a few precautions. And even if someone tried to trace an address to them, there is always plausible deniability. It may look like that address belongs to John Smith because of the viagra he bought with Bitcoin in 2015, but turns out, he left his coins in a wallet that got hacked and no longer owns them. How are you going to prove that wrong? You really can't.

I did not claim they were. I said most pay for things with credit/debit cards.


Sure, wallet addresses are traceable. Individuals using these wallets however, are not.


Not necessarily. Bitcoins can transfer between individuals thousands of times anonymously. Then one person buys something online and gives their name. The original coins' holder cannot be traced to that purchase. 


Only if someone is not using banks. Presently, it is very difficult to conduct business without using a bank. One you register a bank account, you have 0 anonymity.


Like I said, there are many easy ways to avoid this. John using his Coinbase wallet buying the viagra would be easily identified. John who bought the coins from an individual, who bought the coins from another individual, etc. is harder. John who buys bitcoin from several offline sources even harder. John who typically buys things with bitcoin P2P and on Tor and uses VPNs even harder.
Again if you go the traditional route, you may be tying your name to your wallets. But doing just a few things makes it nearly impossible for someone to trace you to your bitcoin stash.
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:35:02

1. Store owner would know who you are no matter what currency you use in that case. If you want privacy, simply don't mix your addresses. If you want to buy naughty things online you would have to use a throwaway address.
2. Police can track you only if you bought the coins on an exchange using your name.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:32:09
How? I never signed onto this.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:25:06
Let's start from the beginning. 
-Most wallets will change addresses with every send. You're not going to reuse the same address.
-Why would someone use address B to make a purchase? Most likely, they would send them to another address, then buy using yet another address. 
Coins are moving all around to many addresses. And if they used a mixer, even more so. Then you're going to say you know this one person is tied to the original address, without a doubt? I suppose if that person was careless and used their Coinbase wallet for things and reused addresses, it would be doable. But a few precautions and there's no chance you could prove that these coins belonged to this person.
-ISPs? VPNs work quite well and are easy to use. 
I get what you're saying, that there are ways to track people, but this is making an assumption that these people are doing nothing to hide their identities. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would do this, but again, just doing a few things would make it impossible, if not extremely difficult, to tie coins to an individual.
@_date: 2019-09-04 05:21:14
You cannot prove who owns what coins, however, unless that person bought them on an exchange under their name. Otherwise, it's anonymous, no matter how much tracking you do.

We agree on the first parts so I'll focus on the last part that we disagree on.


I actually mostly agree with this too. Where I would have a disagreement is how we get there. In the current system, we are allowing a few bureaucrats to take money from people and distribute it how they see fit. I would suggest that there's a better way to solve the societal issues that you outlined, without stealing money from people.
When you say it wouldn't make sense for everyone to have to pay for a private bodyguard, air traffic controllers, etc. that's what we already do, via taxation. Wouldn't you agree that those are things that people want and need? Wouldn't they voluntarily pay for those things if they were not forced to? So then, why do we need to force people to pay? 
Why not have a voluntary society where you pay for what you use, what you want to pay for.
Things like security can surely be pooled without force.
And with all this said, even if every single thing that taxes went towards is beneficial to me, they are still theft, and therefore I'm still against them. Am I making sense?

2. NO it is not going to settle back down to the 220s. 
When this rally finally cools and the crash comes, the price will likely be quite a bit higher than it was for most of 2015. If it goes to 1000 and crashes to 500, the news will be all about the crash, not that it's $300 higher than it was for months.

I will say a few things in response:
I'm not for throwing old people out on the streets. I think the SS system is a total scam and ponzi scheme, but it needs to be phased out, not ripped away.
And we could do a much better job supporting our elderly with charities &amp; churches (like it used to be done), I for one would be happy to voluntarily donate to competent organizations that support beneficial things like this.
Our public schools are doing anything but educating our children, so I'm not in agreement that we should all be forced to pay for a shoddy, failed system. Choice is where it's at, right now, there is very little of that in education, or in taxation.
As far as warmonger politicians, I don't support any politicians. The last one I voted for was Ron Paul, because he was the only principled or at least mostly principled one I came across, but as anti-war as he was, he was drowned in a sea of warmongers. If you want to see exactly how the military-industrial complex works, watch the documentary "Why We Fight"- it sadly shows how in order to win their seats in congress, the politicians have no choice but to support war.
I disagree that we need a strong military for world peace. One, there are no threats to us, we're surrounded by peaceful neighbors, and invaders would have to win a ground war one house at a time, and that would be impossible in this gun-toting country. 
And two, politicians will always use a strong military to get involved in conflicts all over the place, even if we write down words "constraining" them (which never works). It's the health of the state. I don't worship the founding fathers like some but I do see their wisdom in the foreign policy area, and why they were not for having a strong military.
Anyway, good discussion, thanks for not getting personal like so many on reddit do!

Logical fallacy. Even if all countries have taxation, that's meaningless to show that is or is not theft.


Red herring. It's not a choice between taxes by a government or "privatized taxes" whatever that is. It's extortion by governments or a free market where institutional theft doesn't exist.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:52:22
Ha! You need to look at the market in terms of more than just a few days. Solidly above 350 does not a bear market make.
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:37:01
No chance! My rationality is going by the longer term trends. No one can predict these short term movements, my only point is that we're in a bull market long term, which doesn't mean we can't have downward days like today.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:56:03
Roads in my area are full of potholes. Companies are popping up to fix the roads, because the government can't even do that right!
Social security is a joke, the greedy politicians raided it just a few years after its inception. It's the definition of a ponzi scheme.
I'm for solving veterans programs by not going to war, we can support the current vets and then just not go to war, problem solved.
All those agencies you mentioned do more harm than good. We can do better with free market alternatives that don't involve theft (stealing your money via taxation).
Most of your taxes go towards building bombs that kill many innocent people. Most of your taxes are squandered on things like the so-called war on drugs.
The rest we could easily handle without the middleman of corrupt politicians.
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:06:51
I never whined here. You're creating a distraction from the debate. 
Taxes are theft even if you love paying them. It has nothing to do with how to make decisions or calling congress.
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:43:10
Yes 2014 was a bear market. More sellers than buyers. Now, it has turned around. Look at the charts from mid-Sept to now. If you don't see the upward trend, you are actively avoiding seeing it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:58:31
A system that involves taking money from people by force to provide for others is on its face not providing for "the better good".

Nope that was the part the CIA manufactured. There was never any proof given of the hitman accusation.

I wonder where all the dollars go that these government goons are getting. In their pockets or down some bureaucratic sinkhole?
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:36:42
I don't "consider it" theft. It is theft. Me doing something or not has nothing to do with anything. 
Slavery was around for thousands of years before it was eradicated. Does that mean it was right for all those years, and nobody should have tried to destabilize it?

Has anyone asked, how the hell are they going to track all the bitcoin transactions, tie them to a name, and figure out how much that person owes?
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:09:17
Actually in the long run this will help Bitcoin. Of course ISIS and drug cartels are using it, but getting it out in mainstream news means even more people will start using it, despite the fact that they are "clamping down" on it, whatever that means.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:14:27
Based on how things have gone historically for BTC. In September 2013, the idea of $240 bitcoin was a dream, as we were hovering around $100 for a while. 3 months later, we were at $1100. Then it crashed all the way down to the 200s eventually- the new floor. Then, $240 was considered low and negativity was abound.
Based on this, it is more likely that our new floor will be somewhere north of the 200s.

What does happen to all those drugs? I imagine they do sell them in covert ways, or use them.

Bitfinex doesn't count. Let's see 2000 on Kraken before partying.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:21:42
It will happen but we may run up to $1400 or something before it does, and then it will crash to $500 and stay there for a while. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:19:52
You might be right, but it won't likely go back down to the 200s again. We will have a new floor.

Ron Paul is pro-bitcoin. Schiff has vested interest to be anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:33:25
So you have proof?
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:48:20
Schiff loves to move the goal posts. "It's in a bubble!" when it goes up. And "I told you so!" when it goes down.
His best argument is tulip mania? Really bad for a smart dude.

Then nobody should be able to sell guns. Or knives. Or be able to train anyone in karate. 
If you do any of that you're enabling killers.

True in 2009 but not since
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:54:36
Not true. This is still an overall bull market. This is the pullback we never got from 1100-1860. It SHOULD have dropped at that point back to about 1500. Instead it went insane. This pullback was long overdue, but the overall trend is still bull. I'm not saying it won't turn bear but right now, we're in a bull market correction.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:34:31
It was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:32:47
You lost the argument off the bat with childish name calling.
How many people did he kill again?

Coinbase sucks!
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:52:19
Thanks. This is what I was thinking. Some people act like it's absolutely INSANE to keep much on a hot wallet, as if by walking out the door someone could easily just hack into your phone and steal your coins...but it comes down to the usual precautions and you should be fine.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:11:16
Peter Schiff is unbelievably still around saying any day now it's going to zero, and every rally is a "sucker's rally". Mind blowing.

I always thought the lyrics were "Oh lord" not "hold on". Am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:20:21
Except that was never proven to have happened and was likely a fabricated story.

Old headline. 7247 now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:34:04
Where's your proof? Links? Anything?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:52:49
His response would be don't be fooled by this sucker's rally, sell now because it's going to 0. Of course he said that when the price was 70, 200, 4,000, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:27:43
Did he actually criticize the internet though? I thought his stance was "I don't understand it, so I'm not going to invest in it". With bitcoin it seems he likes to slam it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:18:30
No AND Trump will never do this. The reason: Trump is a politician.

He's out on bail awaiting his trial. They're trying to give him 20 years.

If that happens, we then live in a full totalitarian world and we need bitcoin more than ever.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:21:28
Those issues are meaningless.
He shouldn't win again simply because he pursued horrible economic policies, and expanded the wars.
