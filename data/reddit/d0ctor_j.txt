Too funny
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:17:12
At this point Ill take all the BTC haha
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:46:00
This is exciting!  Let's keep the momentum going!
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:12:08
Holy shit, 500.. you are sitting on some cake!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:02:16
Redditors can come at you from all angles!  Thanks for sharing your story and continue to pay it forward!  We need more people like you spreading the knowledge and BTC :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:59:19
Great clarification thanks again!
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:08:48
Yes FaceBook would make waves!
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:22:12
Yep, people will definitely sell out big and it will drop and people will complain and then we can buy and it will go up and we can make money from those who were scared :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:11:17
Well if it drops again, let's snag hard at the 325 level!
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:22:18
Yeah I agree, would hate to have a great week then a poor week, but hey that is BTC volatility at its finest.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:22:44
That might be the case, but we should think positively about what we can control and how we can make an impact. Creating something special could allow us to get some positive influence for Bitcoin.

Hey AnalyzerX7, I love the enthusiasm, but I would much rather have an open discussion here on reddit!  I am a big believer that everyone can bring different angles and ideas to the table!
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:21:32
If the Internet can get people to dump ice water on their head, or donate $100, then I don't see how we can't create a similar positive movement. Whether it is the homeless, or someone else in need, if we can come together as a community- we can create something special. 
I'm open to ideas on who will benefit from this. I wanted to reach out to see if we had any viral influencers who could help us move something forward.

I haven't followed too well, but how has it worked for them?  This huge dip could be a great opportunity to bring things back around!
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:18:39
I think it would be fun to rally as a community, use our talents to start a movement! 
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:19:25
Thank you! Changetip was a great start, but it's time for some more positive news. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:11:32
Love it, could be the start of some "branding"
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:02:55
I am still in college, but have an entrepreneurial spirit with aspirations to change the world (I know it sounds crazy, but the crazy ones are those who make change).  I think we can start here with Bitcoin, unfortunately I do not have enough capital to start an initial huge movement, but every little bit helps and I would be more than happy to have skin in the game.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:00:12
Actually, they raised $94.3 million dollars 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:14:28
Maybe we could put in some "clause" so they can not flip them into USD and offer them other places to "spend" their BTC!
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:12:14
Hey KPrawn, would you mind sharing more info with this thread, I would love to see how we can help support!
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:14:39
It's already plummeting
