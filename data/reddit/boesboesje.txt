Welcome to the club! :) 
Mine is getting close to a month uptime.  :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:22:10
Did it work for you? very curious if this works.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:47:59
20,- euro for 2xXeon, 4gb mem, 5tb traffic and 150gb SSD. +100gb ssd addon is a extra 7,50. You can also get a 2tb addon for 12,- (double with offsite backup) but slower storage. Have to test that option but for now it is cheaper to get a ssd addon for me.
 is my host

Dammit I Panicked and bought some more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:34:52
Because maybe they spend money to be secure? There are also examples that people are being kidnapped for money. 
anyways I think it is more secure to not tell people. :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:21:46
I do it because I have a interest to see the bitcoin network grow, have the time, find it fun and have the money to do so. 
But for me the costs was a little more since I already was running a server with more then enough bandwith. Only needed a bit more diskspace.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:48:35

Yeah that web ui was made by Craig Watson. (That is not me) :) Here is his github page  Also love it. (I should throw him a donation but waiting for the fees drop a bit.)

Wel comcast net worth is 194 billion. So collect 194 billion in bitcoin or hodl till your bitcoin are worth that much. :)

a 2 day reddit account without a source and nothing can be found if I google it.
Looks legit guys. :P
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:08:09
You can discuss if this is a smart move or not. I prefer investing with money I can loose. But that is me. other priorities and comfort whishes.
But! He has been on dutch television and EVERYBODY knows him and have seen pictures from his family. Everybody I know talked about that guy. So what is stopping a mombster from abducting his kid(s) and demanding payment in bitcoin.
If you decide to do this...... don't tell anybody.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:43:37
2xXeon, 4gb mem, 5tb traffic is 20,- euro per month. I only needed to add 7,50 for a extra 100gb ssd space above the default 150GB. If the blockchain get any bigger i can reduces the ssd addon and get a big storage option. About 12,- euro for 2tb. (double if you want offsite backup) I do not need that much storage at the moment. 
I host it at transip in the netherlands. But I need this server for some other stuff as well/ you mightt want to look at other options if you only want a vps for a full node.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:05:10
Yeah! Ill switch to this app as soon as it is mainnet available. Want to have a app I can connect to my own node. Btw if I order pizza and pay with the samourai app do the [samourai pizza cats]( deliver it? :D 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:44:26
Those wallstreat traders also love their cocaine. so buy cocaine to...... wait.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:15:51
Recently I started a bitcoin 24/7 server node to give a little back to the bitcoin network. I had a vps running for some other stuff and with minimal cost for me I could host it. ( for the people interested) Don't worry it is installed without a wallet so if it gets hacked there is nothing valuable on the server.
Currently I am running 0.15.0. Is it needed or wise to keep it up to date? For example update it to every 0.15.x or keep to the main releases? And does anyone know a good blockexplorer i could install on it?
Also I could add a electrum server to it since that is the wallet I prefer to use or does it loose normal bitcoin node functionality?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:08:02
Ah. Ill update my node then. still running 0.15.0 on my vps.
for the ones interested:  Real cewl to setup. :)
Edit: now 0.15.1 not that hard to upgrade. :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:13:38
Find a hooker that accepts bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:49:06
How is your data usage? Running a full node to at  and has been busy :)  :)
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:16:08
Bitonic is a really great dutch site to buy and sell bitcoins. Did not know about satos until now.
@_date: 2018-08-23 10:25:13
I love how slowly more and more shops are accepting bitcoin. Today I used bitcoin for:
\- Buying a pc game.
\- Buying a pizza. 
\- Buying my weed. (legal here)
Would love to get my salary switched to bitcoin and be able to pay my mortage/gas/electra/internet/etc with bitcoin. Sadly not there yet. But great times!
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:13:20
Perfect for me anyway! :D
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:54:39
Would the problem not be the 51% attack but having accounts on exchanges that can withdraw that ammount of money in a short amount of time? I believe most exchanges demand extensive verification for tier 3 accounts. But true. With this kind of power it is easy to attack bch to bring it down.
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:52:33
Really great! i chuckled at "Inflationary money not accepted!" 
I would suggest a list option view for browsing your store. The items are pretty big. But will try as soon as I want a new game. :\)  
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:58:04
The exam was for 6vwo. (Senior/graduation high school) You would expect some of them on reddit. (I am just a old dutchie) Curious if they found the exam hard or not.
@_date: 2019-11-13 10:08:25
Agreed. I am a "old" millennial and love/own/hodl bitcoin. But I am the only one. Friends, family don't "get" it. "why do you need bitcoin we have apple pay and good payment systems." And any discussion about the nature of money and what money is gets you stares.
Only positive is my dad tbh. He is terrible in tech and won't buy bitcoin himself. (wise they have debt to pay) But he just says if you really believe in it keep it. (and the obligatory but be carefull don't risk all your money comment) And always talks about it when bitcoin hits the mainstream news..... I should give my dad a bit of bitcoin on a paper wallet. :P
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:25:07
This means you will leave your country, never come back and never be able to rebuild your life there cause of the burned bridges? Is that worth it to you? I rather keep my options open.
Also you hurt banks more by not doing business with them. They sell your debt to the next smuck and finally the tax payer in the form of a baillout.
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:26:16
\+1 voor BL3P. 
[Bitonic.nl]( started BL3P and they are a great site to buy and sell bitcoin. I bought my first bitcoins with them. bitonic has some wide margings with buying and selling compared to a exchange but it is just a buy/sell service. 
If you are dutch you can even pay them with ideal. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:56:02
Hoping it stays low for a bit longer so I can buy more next month. Had some unexpected expenses. Luckly I did not need to sell anny bitcoin for those expenses. :)
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:59:37
Sure why not. You are young without a partner or kids. If you are going to take a risk now is the time to do it. So long you keep 1 golden rule: NO DEBT
Do not get into fiat debt to buy more bitcoin. beside that a young guy 25 with a nice degree and no money should be able to build himself up again if you would lose it all.
@_date: 2019-03-08 06:28:18
A full bitcoin node uploads to and not just one block. So that counts to. 300gb is about right but can vary widely. My node with default connections limit at a 1gb network connection usage:
* March      190 GB (at march 8th so maybe a lot higher this month)
* february  404 GB
* january    252 GB
So it can vary alot.

Yeah today is payday. Put some savings in bitcoin (like every month) and bought a game using bitcoin. Live is good. :)
Shoutout to [ for being a awesome webshop! 
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:45:49
Don't see it as bitcoin gaining value in argentina. See it more like the peso losing value because of (hyper)inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:01:57
Well possible. I think more as a lessons learned kinda thing. And all those altcoins that fail will only confirm that bitcoin is king and also confirming its value.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:15:19
Zoom out. Don't look at the hourly, 15 min charts but on the daily, weekly, monthly charts. 
So basically..... it takes time don't be greedy. :P
@_date: 2019-08-12 21:21:02
Really hope it turns out for the best with the primary elections. Best of luck man.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:20:59
Yeah creator is also active on reddit. see here his post: [
Going to try his shop the next time I want a game. Nothing on the list yet.
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:24:12
Yup. Did the same a while back with my ARK and took the loss. Had also some ripple witch I sold but that loss was not that big. For me no more shitcoins only bitcoin from now on.
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:48:12
Nice. 
100% in my portfolio.
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:07:52
Ill be never able to time that so I probably just loose money if i tried. Ill just hodl trough the pullback like normal.
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:08:00
Well. His latest claim is that Satoshi plagiarized his work.
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:48:20
Maybe [ is something for you?
It is available in all European countries and you can deposit money with sepa transactions. Other payment options are more focused on dutch customers since it is a dutch company. I buy/sell my bitcoins there and never had any problems with them. I even believe if you open a Bunq banking account they deposit money the same day. [  And not sure but I believe when you have a bunq account you can use ideal payments for instant deposits.
I havn't switched yet to bunq cause switching banks is a pain in the \*\*\* but so far banks go I like them. They just charge you for the services and store your money without using it for big risky investments.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:24:16
I was sleeping when this was happening. Still counts as strong hodl right guys?
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:40:51
Maybe also get a extra bank account with a different bank. There where some stories of people getting their bank account closed.
@_date: 2019-02-27 07:14:41
Second that!

Sorry was my bad I bought some just before the dip.
@_date: 2019-12-19 07:29:19
Pay of mortage and buy a extra house. (going to rent out my current apartment. Renting market is crazy where I live) If it goes to 1 mil because of a market crash I will probably buy some stock. (trusthworty companys with a good dividend history) Maybe even buy a extra apartment to rent it out. basically Invest in things that will generate passive income and be debt free.
Also a large portion will still be in bitcoin. Maybe with a % try to time market to realize again I am not good in that. XD
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:31:17
Damm How about "sevensixfivefourthreetwoone"? Easy to remember and nobody would think to count backwards. :)
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:57:50
Maybe take a look at Bunq bank. They work very well together with the [bl3p.eu]( exchange. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:51:06
You would only pay property tax on your primary residance and wealth tax on extra houses/property you might own. On your stocks you pay wealth tax minus the 40k what would be exempt.
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:45:30
Yup. But I whish I was that rich that I have to pay the tax. :P If you have 1 home and less then 40k (which are most people) this isn't a thing to worry about.
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:21:20
Agree it is shitty but what can you do? Our tax laws are even more absurd if you want to give somebody money or inherit something. However the facilities in my country are good. We got good healthcare, good roads and a pretty safe country. Also they lowered the income tax this year so the medium household (that does not have +40k) get a little more money. 
I think if you compare it with japan at the end we probably pay around the same % at the end. 
No you can not chunk it because you have to fill in your total wealth on your tax return form. some people try it tho and get a swiss bank account or something. IF they catch you however you get some really have fines. At the end its not worth it. A couple a yers ago they gave all tax evaders a deal that if you came clear you would not be fines and only had to pay back taxes. A lot of people took that deal since the swiss law changed about bank privacy. 
You could so some shady stuff if you are really shit by creating a foundation and put the money in there. don;t know how that works precisely but read somewhere the the really rich do that legaly evade some taxes.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:48:51
Firt day of the year. I have to do taxes from last year and I have to give the value of my crypto dated on 1 januari 2018. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:59:29
ATM Dutch goverment is bitcoin friendly. No capital gain tax. Only the tax on savings is a bit dodgy but that is the same for all savings. (They add 4% of your savings as taxable income if it is above 40k)
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:59:17
It is not so bad as it sounds and only apply's on wealth above 40k. They tax you becasue they think wealth above that is getting a 4% return of investment/interest each year. Over that 4% you pay income tax so it isn't the full 4% of your wealth that you have to pay. (yes you always have to pay that even if you didn't make 4% on that money. That is the strange/fucky part)
It is a old tax law when interest rates with banks where about 4/5%. Also they want you to use that money above 40k to pay of your mortage. Since we get a tax return on mortage payments.
The up side is tho if crypto goes to the moon again we do not pay capital gains. Tax over wealth will be much cheaper than captial gain tax. Also as said below it is really a bad idea to try and cover up your wealth. The penalty's are really harsh if they find out.

"can not be paid in euros." this may be a point as a presedent. If a contract states a bitcoin amount is owed without a date to determine the value in euros. It can have some big implecations due to value changing. Especially when people are late with transfering the bitcoins. 
Also might be wise for traders to check how it is stated in there short contracts. :P
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:52:12
Nope. that is the fucky part. they calculate 4% even if you do not get that much interest. highest interest here is like 0.5% I think.

The php script opens a rpc call and that function you say is a client option. I do not believe it is possible to use the old getinfo trough rpc call what the php script is doing.
You can find the code here and there is a ticket for this problem.

I run my node on a debian 9 machine and compile from source. So I downloaded the tar.gz file, extracted it, compiled it with some specific configure options and copied the executables over the old ones.
