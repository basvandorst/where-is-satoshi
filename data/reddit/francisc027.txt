Libra in spanish/portuguese means pound. So everyone who is native on those languages have a strong association with a unit of weight measurement.. and from what i read, they want to target third world countries.. so imagine the confusion.. why do i have to change my pesos to a coin that represents how i know how much an object weights...
also libra is associated to the british pound.. just to add more to the mix...
There is poor research in here or either they have a bigger plan behind it.. but for god sakes... in all the entire universe of names, why they pick something that is commonly already in use...

excellent link Aussie.. cheers
newie here in the BTC world... any recommendations on mobile wallets and AU exchanges? had a look at BTC Markets but fees are 0.85% of the transaction. is that a standard for exchanges here in OZ?

if it's just to buy and hold go for established AU exchanges.. if you want to go into the trade game is another story as those exchanges have very less competitive rates that overseas... the trick is to move those coins around to minimize fees
