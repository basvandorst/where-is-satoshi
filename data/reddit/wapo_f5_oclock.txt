The economic illiteracy in this comment is off the charts.

A lot of exchanges were hacked over the years. The blockchain itself may be secure for the time being, but the exchanges are not.

[This can't not be a bubble](
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:01:10
As long as bitcoin is deflationary, it will never be viable as a currency. A deflationary currency inevitably leads to economic collapse. During the Great Depression, the quantity of dollars in the economy fell. There was enormous deflation, prices fell, wages fell, and unemployment rose. In an extreme scenario, bitcoin would grow so popular that investments in the real economy would come to a halt (because people are investing in crypto instead of businesses and stocks), the economy would enter a recession, and a deflationary spiral would happen. This would lead to an economic depression, which means prices all over the economy would fall, wages would fall, and unemployment would rise. Governments will never let it come to this.

You're out of your mind if you think crypto is outside the control of politicians, bankers and corporations.

Watch the government make it illegal for credit unions to hold money from exchanges.

It's a bubble. It's inevitably going to crash and *not recover*. It can't rise forever, it serves no real-life purpose, it's too volatile, and the only reason people are buying it is to make quick money. The "bitcoin protocol" is irrelevant. The blockchain is irrelevant. Bubbles are completely independent of technology. It doesn't matter if it's tulip bulbs, digital cryptocurrency, or intergalactic wormhole derivatives. It's a speculative asset that's rising in price exponentially for the only reason that people want to be rich, and like all such past assets, it's going to crash and *not recover*.

That would require people opening accounts in foreign banks, something which they (at least Swiss ones) [refuse to let Americans do]( and still wouldn't [put you out of the reach of the IRS](

I expect a permanent crash with no recovery sometime in the future.

The difference is that people buy items like telephones, cars, and air travel to improve their quality of life. Bitcoin doesn't improve qualify of life. People buy bitcoin to make quick money. Because of its fixed supply, bitcoin will gain value until demand stops growing, which it will eventually, even if every single unit of fiat currency on the planet is invested in crypto, at which point it's going to crash.

No need to know anything about the protocol or blockchain to realize that bitcoin is a bubble.

Who would give in eventually? The US govt? They have been so successful that they broke Swiss banking secrecy and now Swiss banks refuse to let Americans open accounts.
[This has led to people renouncing their US citizenship]( however. So if you're willing to permanently move to another country (where you will likely enjoy a lower salary) and renounce your US citizenship, just to avoid paying taxes on your crypto capital gains, more power to you.

Investing in a deflationary asset without any fundamentals is a recipe for a recession. If instead of investing in real-world things like businesses and infrastructure, everyone starts to hoard bitcoin, that's money that's removed from the economy.
Don't cry when you lose your job because your hoarding caused a recession.

You're talking about two completely separate issues. The gold standard on one hand, and sovereign debts on the other hand. The gold standard was a bad idea for all kinds of reasons ([1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( Sovereign debts are due to budget mismanagement and the 2008 financial crisis.
