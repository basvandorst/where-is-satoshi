Whether to call Bitcoin a "fiat" currency depends on the definition. If "fiat" means a currency that is not legally redeemable in some other commodity, then yes, Bitcoin is a fiat currency. But if "fiat" means a currency relying on government fiat to define what will count as legal money, then Bitcoin is not.

"But none of these investments has been as atrociously awful as bitcoin...."
You need to compare like with like. Bitcoin isn't being traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It's hard to buy.
"Collapses of large, unregulated bitcoin exchanges—such as Mt. Gox—have done little to instill confidence in the currency either."
If Mt. Gox was unregulated, why did the regulators seize their Dwolla account? Bitcoin exchanges are heavily regulated.

"Switzerland should participate in discussions around the bitcoin . If there are opportunities , the Swiss financial center must be able to respond. If there are risks, there would be serious that Switzerland is a haven for money launderers . " National Councillor Jean Christophe Schwaab (PS / VD) welcomes the Federal Council accepts its premise .
Indeed , the Federal Council shares the concern of Jean Christoph Schwaab and wants to assess the risks that the virtual currency Bitcoin could pose to the Swiss economy. " In New York, there is already a hotel that accepts payments in bitcoin . In Berlin , too, either accept the trade . This is for very trivial now, but its use could quickly spread . And we must be prepared , "says Jean-Christophe Schwaab .
Transactions in an almost anonymous
The elected socialist actually feared that bitcoin is massively used to launder money - "it is a system that allows transactions almost anonymously " - but he does not see only dangers. "The bitcoin, like all virtual currencies could quickly grow. It has the advantage to skip the middlemen who take commissions and task either business or consumers, " said Jean Christophe Schwaab .
In both cases , Jean Christophe Schwaab sees the need to control the process of creating a private currency. "For the number of issued bitcoin is limited. So there is a great danger of speculation , "says Jean-Christophe Schwaab .
international regulation
National Councillor and put his request in perspective with other international initiatives . Many countries want to regulate the bitcoin or banned. "Two U.S. senators have also asked about the extensive use of the currency school ," says Jean-Christophe Schwaab which speaks of a " global awareness ."
Invented in 2009 after the global financial crisis, the bitcoin has experienced during its short history highly volatile . In recent months, he flew nearly 400% in a mysterious computer hidden under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto . Its volatility is very large : its course this year flew more than 400 % in the first quarter. It trades around 145 euros in October 2013 , but it was worth less than 20 euros in October of last year !

The root of the bitcoin debate is about where value comes from. Weisenthal believes value comes from direct utility. What he calls "Inherent value". He doesn't believe in the Subjective Theory of Value. 
Money is a means to an end. So it's direct utility is irrelevant. 
The reason people value dollars is because we can imagine the goods and services that dollars can buy. Same thing goes for bitcoin.
"The subjective theory of value is a doctrine of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor required to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of their desired ends.  This theory is one of the core concepts of the Austrian School of Economics, but is also accepted by most other "mainstream" schools of economics."

Many people define inflation as any increase in the money supply. If all other factors remain equal, this devalues the currency. 
Bitcoin is devalued every time a block is mined. It's just like money printing, just more decentralized. 
The value of bitcoin is going up because the population of the bitcoin economy is expanding faster than the blocks are mined. Among other things.

I think her point was that cash is still more anonymous than Bitcoin. Federal Reserve Notes don't have microchips in them recording their history. Plus every type of criminal has always accepted legal tender. Does that mean we should ban government issued money? 
The truth is the drug cartels aren't really interested in Bitcoin. Places like Silk Road threaten the drug cartel business model. They're not going to encourage something that's against their best interests.

Right! Most people seem to think it's the dollar vs. bitcoin. "If bitcoin explodes, the dollar will fall." 
There's no reason both can't survive. If someone increases their prosperity and production through the bitcoin economy, they will have more goods and services to offer the dollar economy. 
Since the frictionless bitcoin economy increases the supply of goods and services to everyone, the purchasing power of fiat will also go up. Fiat's purchasing power will benefit via proxy.  
I think most people will accept both dollars and bitcoins for a long time.

Bitcoin is both a currency and a transaction mechanism. IMO, it's easier to show the value of the transaction mechanism first. Compare bitcoin exchanges to Western Union.

Normally you don't want to keep your coins on someone else's website. They can close at any moment and take your coins. 
Coinbase probably won't do that though. The head guy is from Goldman Sachs. They won't run out of money. 
With two factor authentication, Coinbase should be secure. 
Personally, I move the coins to multibit. It's on a computer that is almost never online.
