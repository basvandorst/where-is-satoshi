You realize that would completely crash the price of BTC right?
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:27:47


No, that's an opinion. One I mostly agree with, but still. Not a fact.


How many internet companies failed in the late 90s again? I'm not sure but I'm going to guess thousands of them. The technology behind Bitcoin may very well reach wider adoption but under which form or name? Who knows.


Thank you for acknowledging it this time.


Jesus H. Chill on the cool-aid.


Only 1000000% more to go! What if BTC crashes or you never convert it into goods or services, or heaven forbid, back into that pesky USD which I'm positive is your end goal.


Are they? Find them for me. Ask people on the street if they are losing faith in the USD. Come back with their answers please.

Even if it was and someone with future knowledge started stacking them that early, they would cause a ripple effect (because of the extremely low liquidity in 2010) completely changing the outcome and progression of Bitcoin's history.

This of course is assuming you already won the lottery by being aware of Bitcoin during its inception and could predict its future or that you have a time machine.

Currency needs stable inflation to encourage spending. Otherwise you end up with hoarders, wealth inequality and a stagnant economy.

That is not what a strawman argument is... Strawmanning is when you change the premise of somebodies argument to something they did not intend. 
Nobody knows what the price of BTC will be in 10 years and that is a fact.

What about the 2010 hack that created billions of BTC out of thin air and had to be hard forked out?

Essentially stop thinking of it as an investment and start treating it like currency. Build your wealth by providing services that people will pay you for. Anyone in the world with a BTC wallet can be your customer.  Why get involved with trading, exchanges, KYC'd on ramps etc... Get off your ass and work for it.

Depends on what profitability is like at the time, but most likely at least some outdated hardware will be forced to shut down.

Wow, before you get your panties in a bunch, I work at a 0.6MW mining farm and trust me this growth is not sustainable. It is only a matter of time before power distribution to miners becomes HEAVILY regulated (already is in many regions).

IMO Bitcoin isn't really designed or practical for brick and mortar merchants... It is Money over IP. It allows you to pay for internet services... on the internet. It integrates more easily with ecommerce where blocktimes are irrelevant.

He is just describing network effects that happen naturally when more efficient miners hit the market.
Even the largest miners out there don't earn enough to manipulate the price that drastically. Not to mention that hashrate dip happened *before* the price drop.
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:26:22


Only a handful of companies account for the vast majority of mining demand. [Bitfarms.io]( for example operates 50MW in Quebec with 100MW more in their production queue.
Anything under 50kW and Hydro Quebec doesn't bother regulating you as a miner.
What do you consider a small operation? Even wiring 10-20 ASICS in your home would require work from the utility company.


That's' great! Too bad no single political party in Quebec has any plans to fuck with the operation of Hydro Quebec. People are quite happy with it as it is there. And should be, considering they get the cheapest power in NA.
@_date: 2019-09-11 22:33:16


Transmission is expensive. If a miner leases a warehouse to mine the utility company has to build out the necessary lines and transformers to supply it. Prior to June 2018 the utility company was responsible for this cost but the new policy requires mining operations to cover development expenses on the utility's end.
IMO the policy makes sense. They want to attract miners but minimize risk by rewarding fixed contracts to only serious miners, charging them for the development costs and capping the total distribution at an amount that is manageable. The only reason Quebec was so appealing in the first place is because of the fixed, cheap rates. No 'corporate' sized 'reliable' miner would sign a contract with a variable rate... Hydro Quebec knows this and wants their mining customers to remain in business long term.
No warehouse comes equipped for mining... We spent $200 000 on our electrical infrastructure and we got in before the new policy so we didn't spend a dime on our entry point from Hydro Quebec.

Hashrates are rising because everyone is upgrading to 7-8nm (new ASICS). You can get 2-3X the hashrate for the same power draw.
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:08:09
Wow, what has happened to this community. You fucking delusional people can't handle an ounce of honest skepticism.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:55:31
Yes, miners can jump to another pool if they believe the one they are using is misbehaving. However, that doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of miners *do not* run nodes.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:42:37
You are on r/bitcoin, I don't think these people believe in "society" or "common good". Pretty sure they  think that Mad Max is a utopia.
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:46:08
I'm a Quebec miner. It's understandable that policy was written to regulate the expansion of Bitcoin miners. The demand was insane and you need to properly vet applicants before you build a multi megawatt infrastructure for them that might only be used for a couple of years. 
It is a public utility and you can't have the entire industry tied up dealing with miners.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:48:02
7-8nm chips with 2-3X power efficiency over S9.
@_date: 2019-09-17 00:45:24
Mining ASICS =/= Nodes. Millions of devices from thousands of different mining operations typically all work for only a handful of pool nodes.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:49:25
Oh please. More likely a regional power outage or just a glitch in stat reporting because of wildly fluctuating block times.

I once saw a redditor take a video with their phone of a static image on their screen (with reddit clearly open in the background) and upload it as a GIF to a gpumining sub. They were asking about an error code that is easily googlable.
Some, fucking, people.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:07:52
Innosilicon and MicroBT are also pushing large volumes of competitive miners. And no, they were clearly brand new. It's not hard to figure it out on your own... The hash increases are clearly correlated with the delivery dates. If Bitmain was mass mining with new units and then selling them used the hashrate would have skyrocketed much earlier than it did.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:05:09
Why? Hashrate fluctuations of 20-30% happen almost daily. That drop could easily be attributed a very small handful of farms within the same region losing power.
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:56:46


Same thing would happen if they did not regulate mining expansion. Thousands of miners enter the market, billions gets spent on infrastructure, rates go up, miners are forced to relocate. Now you have miners abandoning expensive infrastructure.
Hydro Quebec is tightly regulated to provide a certain rate to residential customers and an unregulated mining market would make that very difficult.
Project requests were totaling more than 500 MW at one point. You can't just hand out that much power distribution without carefully thought out policy. *Especially* to an industry as unpredictable as crypto mining.
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:22:37


Multi megawatt commercial space at the scale of large mining operations *doesn't exist*! Miners need it purpose built. Mining is not a proven long term industry and if the industry fails, there is no other industry that would fill the abandoned infrastructure. This is a huge risk to the utility provider. 


Electricity in Quebec is a ***public*** utility. As I said before, they have legally binding commitments to keep rates low for citizens/residents. This is just how the system is and has been for decades in Quebec. You can argue your economic beliefs all day but good luck restructuring an entire public utility system just to deal with one industry.
