Also, the goverment aint black or white. It's not that simple. Not everyone supports our financial system. People who work for the government too see the problem with the current economy and they want change for the people. Not everyone up there is evil and anti-people. So what about the possibility Bitcoin actually is by someone in the NSA or CIA but it is intended as it is, with no evil conspiracy back door?

Satoshi is probably scared to death and knows people are looking for him. Although with no intention to let him alive ;)

It's open source. We do not just blindly trust Satoshi Nakamoto, we actually have proof his peer-to-peer eletronic cash system works as intended. If there is a unknown backdoor then it must be well thought-through I guess. Though I'm no expert

Feels like a revolution and we are celebrating. Why so mad, doesn't matter how long you've been investing

Obviously decentralization was Satoshis plan and vision. There is no single point of failure and bc there will only be a limited supply, it will be a real deflationary currency

But I love this. Everytime Bitcoin hit a new record and I witnessed it, I want to go to this sub to see other people talking about it. Feels good and I see why you want people to stop, but I really like it this way. Doesn't hurt

You should attach Satoshi's whitepaper to your post
