I have wondered whether he is quietly loading up on on all the alts which show promise, in order to hedge his massive BTC holding.
Interesting that (with its 4MB/10min capacity) LTC is ramping up since the debate has hit a roadblock here.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:43:05
This is so twisted it's not even funny.
Total bandwidth requirement is not the problem, it is the *data burst* requirement and *critical path* inherent with solved blocks. 
Real-time tx are distributed uniformly across the 10 minute block window and the network has huge capacity to handle those, maybe 100 TPS, more than enough to buy years of growth and see LN and other off-chain solutions develop and take volume on their own merits. 
No single tx is on the critical path for updating the blockchain. Some could take minutes to propagate or get lost entirely.
Blocks are different. When a block is solved the rest of the network is not only hashing uselessly, but also destructively (i.e. all it can do is create a fork). A block is on the critical path, it is not only a burst of data comparable to the previous 10 minutes, it must be propagated and verified as soon as possible.
IBLT massively reduces the data burst requirement as well as the time on critical path. This is why Kalle and Rusty's presentation in HK is arguably the most important of all of them.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:44:00
Rusty, I think that this is a great basis for a compromise and hopefully it will get some support from Core Dev.
It does seem crazy not to at least scale the limit in line with bandwidth improvements.

Luke, please spend a small amount of your BTC and treat yourself to a top-class broadband service.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:04:46
while the block reward stays the same (for about 4 years) the total coins are increasing slowly. So the % increase after each block gets mined is slightly smaller. The 8.95% is annualized.
This is interesting because at the next halving to 12.5 BTC the Bitcoin inflation rate will become comparable to that in many OECD countries.
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:53:14
Satoshi never expected fees to quickly replace the block reward. It's a multi-decade process. 
However, the average 1MB block earlier this year had 0.25 BTC in fees which means that a 20MB block could have 5 BTC in fees.
At the present growth rate an average block size of 20MB should see comparable fees per block close to the time of the 6.25 BTC reward.
Unless of course Bitcoin is crippled by the 1MB long before, which will cause fees to stagnate and then fall away as cryptocurrency users seek workable alternatives.

While everyone needed to run a full node in order to own bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:39:47
Sometimes Mike should stop trying too hard to answer hypothetical questions.
Obviously the Chinese miners are very important, and they are saying they want larger blocks, but not more than 10MB for at least a couple of years. Fine, give them what is eminently sensible, and don't waste time on destructive what-ifs like the subject of this reddit post.
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:16:08
Correct. This is the most insidious aspect of the 1MB: it is dormant software.
Until recently it has had no effect, so Bitcoin has effectively functioned for 6 years *without* a block size limit.
Imposing one now is the radical change, a radical economic experiment which has a far higher probability of causing harm than good.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:59:45
At least its bigger than 1
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:03:03


Correct. Trying leverage this temporary anti-spam measure (from the time when all BTC users had to run full nodes) is ridiculously dangerous. Confirmation times will blow out, as David Hudson describes, and thousands of users will be upset, stalling ecosystem growth.
The risk inherent in steadily  increasing blocks is far less, and will give time for people to advance SC &amp; LN solutions, as well as allowing devs to find out where the real bottlenecks are. Maybe there will be problems with 3MB blocks. We need to find out in order that solutions can be worked on to a known problem. Maybe it will get to 32MB with the network largely as it is. We just don't know, and never will know if foolish ideas like keeping the 1MB prevail.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:09:20
Yeah, that was the original proposal, but after the blow-back it became a one-time step 20MB at 1st March 2016, (which is how the patch is currently coded).
Frankly, using block versions is safer, and an annual % increase makes a lot more sense to me. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:34:57
I agree that 3MB + 15% (or 3.5MB + 17%) is tight, and may well require another hard-fork some years along the road, but eventually so would a one-time increase to 20MB.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:55:10
Yeah, but it appears that Bitcoin is so centrally controlled that a minority can veto the 8MB even though 60% of the mining power says they are OK with it and a majority of users and businesses are OK with it too.
@_date: 2015-06-26 06:32:11
I like BIP100. I like Gavin's 8MB schedule.
They both allow scaling, and buy time for off-chain solutions like SC and LN to prove themselves and take market share based upon their merits to the global marketplace.
Keeping the 1MB in the misguided belief that it can solve problems, will in fact create massive problems, including capping the total fees per block making it forever less than the block reward.
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:02:12
Awesome quote.
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:49:11
Most of the people who want larger blocks have an open mind about how it can be done. There are dozens of solutions.
The problem is that a minority reject ALL solutions and want to see the block limit maxed out. They think of some benefits, but these are vastly outweighed by the negatives, especially, a PR disaster which will scar Bitcoin for years.
The discussion kicked off in Feb 2013. The time for the &gt;2MB/&lt;2yr solution was then. Now the 2 years are gone and probably only 1 year remains before PR diasaster.
It could take 1 year to safely roll out a block size change.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:01:56


The global ecosystem smooths this out. Look at tradeblock or blockchain.info live tx arriving. It is very smooth compared to the punctuated arrival of blocks.


Exactly, so it is important to eliminate the designed-in necessity for data bursts.


A critical path is not a physical route. It is a design limitation inherent in many systems where parallel activities are not possible or constrained. In a blockchain all blocks have equal importance for lengthening it, and a hash of the previous (header) is present in the next block. The time taken for consensus on new blocks must be made as short as possible but can never reach zero.
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:39:53
A one-time hard-fork is best in theory, but the 32 MB message limit is another problem which will need dealing with as well. So it is unlikely one fork will be enough long-term.
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:27:07
Except that the network has functioned perfectly well for 6 years with effectively "no transaction caps". It is only this year that the 1MB is being meaningfully approached, so now it is heading into a new phase, different from 2009-14. This new phase is an untested (perhaps untestable as it needs a real ecosystem) experiment. Riding the simple hope that a hard-limit will filter "wanted" tx from "unwanted" ones. Good luck with that!
@_date: 2015-06-21 06:31:32
I know its not like this, but 2.5 years of this blocklimit drama makes it look like it.

32MB, the max message size becomes the max block size if the 1MB disappeared.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:30:01
Great graphic, but it *does* prove that we are close to needing it.
First, 100% usage of the 1MB (over 1 or 2 weeks) is not achievable because some miners will create small or empty blocks even if 50,000 unconfirmed legitimate, fee-paying tx were backing up. 80% is more likely to be the max average block size over 1 or 2 weeks.
Secondly, it is pretty common in IT to prevent fixed size data structures, at the mercy of market forces, to exceed 40% loading. This is the point when changes should be worked on to up-scale.
If you think that too many current tx are spam then the solution is to design and build better spam-filtering, not to sit back and hope that a fixed limit can somehow magically perform better spam-filtering than anything else tried before.

Consider that 1 bitcoin is equivalent to 1 share in the world's most advanced payment network.
It can:
hold value which is not subject to counterfeiting
send value person-to-person anywhere in the world
values demonstrated of up to $147 million equivalent
received within a few seconds, irrevocably confirmed in hours
negligible fees
no censorship or permissions
24/7, no bank holidays
perfect for internet use (unlike credit cards)
allows inbuilt escrow and multi-signatures
allows for software layers for registering transfers of any assets such as land
The potential of the payment system is huge and the market is determining $8 billion thus far. 
~600 per share is pretty reasonable I think.

The gamechanger is block compression / propagation efficiency. Matt's relay system is reportedly achieving 85% block size reduction. The IBLT concept can go a lot further. The problem you describe is largely mitigated through more efficient block propagation.
What is needed is some flexibility in the existing 1mb limit until the block efficiency changes are fully implemented. 
Scaling with bandwidth should be sufficient in the long run (provided micro-tx are handled off-chain).

I hear what you are saying and understand the perspective. Back in early 2013 I was very noisy about SD's messaging spam on the blockchain. People were saying that 50% of the disk space they had for the blockchain was being filled with someone else's gambling. Then betbots were being written which could have filled 1MB blocks. It was the dust threshold increase which finally brought the flooding under control, plus Eric's SD changes.
However, Bitcoin must survive without relying on people being nice. If OP codes exist for data storage then they are to be used upon payment of a high enough fee, or not provided at all. I don't think the 2.0 apps are deliberately intended to be abusive.

Incorrect. 
Utility (functionality, usefulness) has value. Use value is intrinsic to the Bitcoin payment network because it facilitates commerce. A bitcoin currency unit is native to the payment network, hence it inherits value. If the network collapses then of course the currency unit bitcoin falls to zero value.
Utility value trumps imputed value. A kilo of gold can be worth far less than a liter of water to someone dying of thirst in a desert.
Fiat paper is a claim on taxes raised by the issuing government, but in reality a fiat bill presented to the government for redemption is met only by another fiat bill. But they also facilitate commerce, so have use value.

An idiot who knows nothing about payment systems, and why the intrinsic value of a bitcoin is huge because bitcoins are native to the world's most advanced payment system.

This is good news. It helps Bitcoin to scale when transactions are off-chain.
I don't like the idea of them being forced off-chain (because of high fees, block limits), but off-chain volume which occurs through market developments is positive. This is how microtransactions should work too.

Think this through.Someone attempts to double-spend waits an entire hour before publishing the 2nd transaction when 99.8% of blocks are solved in less time.
So this strategy means that the double-spender buys 200 cars before it is likely 1 can be obtained fraudulently.

Ultimately this is a huge mistake.
The US government should acquire a significant holding in Bitcoin as a "strategic reserve". The dollar, and other fiat currencies, are likely to collapse because there is no political will to return to the gold standard. A large Bitcoin holding will hedge the government against being a victim of its own out-of-control money-printing.

Anyone can download the bitcoin software and change it to increase the limit!
For example, it can be amended to pay out 1000 bitcoins per mined block. You can even change the difficulty so that it mines a block immediately.
The problem starts when you publish your block. Thousands of other nodes see that it does not meet their own specification: so the rogue block is rejected.

Apparently, the Australian agency confiscating the proceeds of crime is so flummoxed by the anonymity of A$ fiat, that it could only confiscate a tiny fraction of proceeds of illegal activity. 
So, despite the fact that Bitcoin accounts for a tiny amount of illegal activity compared to A$ cash, the reported Bitcoin seizure is in the  "millions" of A$ equivalent. Similar to the entire amount seized in A$ fiat for the year.
Therefore, a Bitcoin economy is far harder to perform illegal activity in, than an A$ economy.

The OP reasonably asks if the Bitcoin price is "market speculative insanity". Not only does it has real value because of its incredible economic utility, but also robustness by physical computing power far greater than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined.

@_date: 2014-10-06 23:33:47
I too have been thinking about this for 18 months and have come to the conclusion that learning from empirical evidence is the best approach.
Bitcoin has functioned well for nearly 6 years, so scaling in accordance with Moore's Law should be conservative and safe for maintaining decentralization.
The constraint is bandwidth. So the max block limit should scale with bandwidth. This can be done automatically, as suggested, by a fixed percentage based upon the recent global trend in bandwidth improvement. 
If this later proves off-target then a manual adjustment could be made. However, that would probably be unnecessary as block compression (transaction hashes, IBLT) will get far more mileage out of the block space than the existing software does.

The major problem with retro-fitting a fiat currency onto a cryptocurrency model is that crypto-dollars (for example) would need to be centrally controlled, otherwise they would be bitcoin clones.
Central control means centralization of trust, which has been proven to be a failed model since Caesar's time. Cypto-dollars would not have a reliably capped limit of issuance.
Decentralization is an essential feature of a successful cryptocurrency.

The downside of the individual list approach is that it weakens the most powerful tool for improving Bitcoin's scalability: IBLT. Needed so that one day it can rival MasterCard and VISA on volumes. 
IBLT works best when node unconfirmed tx mempools are in sync, ideally 98+% the same. Gavin talks about it here: 
When nodes are doing all their own different spam filtering (or blacklisting) then their mempools are more divergent and IBLT will be less effective.

Because of zero fees it is easy for traders and bots to churn thousands of coins trying to make even the smallest profit.
Consider Bitstamp or MtGox's best rate of 0.2%. At $850 per coin it costs $3.40 to make a round trip (buy/sell or sell/buy). You can't do that many times without eroding your capital. For many traders the fee is more like $8 per rt.

Bitcoin is inflationary, currently 11% but this will fall to near zero.
Prices in bitcoins are only falling because the Bitcoin ecosystem is growing very fast, hence the value of the system and currency unit also appreciates.
In a Bitcoin economy, when adoption plateaus, prices will be stable except for products which improve through innovation and technology, which is what should happen.
Indeed. Savers are being destroyed by Central Bank ZIRP policies and government deficit spending funded by money printing and interest payments to banks funded by credit money growth.

This is excellent as a possible future solution to the "growing blockchain" problem, but it is no good having massive storage capacity if it is utilized at less than 6MB per hour. It takes 3 years to fill an existing 1TB disk at 6MB per hour, or 3000 years to fill a theoretical 1PB disk.
Disk storage is not the bottleneck, it is bandwidth, which is why "compression" solutions like IBLT which massively save on bandwidth are important now.
The 1MB limit is, of course, Satoshi's Biggest Mistake, which makes all the benefits of extreme storage, and extreme compression, become  useless.

Bitcoin is inflationary. It is presently increasing at a rate of 11% per annum. This will slow substantially by 2040 and completely by 2140.
Prices in bitcoins are deflating because peer-to-peer payment system technology is on an exponential growth phase. Prices in bitcoins will stabilize when market saturation is complete.
Although Bitcoin is finite, cryptocurrency is infinite. So, in the case that a stable money supply causes a problem with growing GDP (which is very debatable) then other crypto like Litecoin would be used widely as well. Multiple blockchains do co-exist, and it is very fast to exchange crypto to crypto.

Consumers must be able to choose whether they want consumer protection, or not. 
Let's assume that the whole idea of regulated consumer protection is meant to be beneficial. In which case consider bitco A based in a no-protection state, and bitco B based in NY with a bitlicence and consumer protection. Then consumers should be attracted to bitco B, and wary of bitco A. So NY-based companies would get more business, because of the consumer protection which firms there must demonstrate to regulators.
Same for foreign consumers. They can choose to use bitco C in dodgy offshore country X, or bitco B in NY. In which case NY gets more of the bitcoin ecosystem business because of good regulation.
However, if the consumer protection is mandatory for all companies based on whether they have NY resident consumers, and NY consumers must have consumer protection (or give up using bitcoins) then the whole thing is a complete mess. An unenforceable and unworkable mess.
The protection must be enforced on companies dependent upon the legal jurisdiction of their incorporation. Then consumers choose to use the companies which have the level of consumer protection they want.

The Federal Reserve Act forbids direct purchases of treasuries and only "old" ones can be bought in the secondary market.

I do get his point. And that is why I mentioned fee policy and coin dust, because these settings are what deters rogue miner's junk tx, not the 1MB.
Maybe I should have added "nothing changes when the max is 20MB hence I support a larger block max, because avoiding the risk of crippling delays in confirmations is important".
I also think this theory is dubious, as miners are focused on the incentive of the bock reward, not gamesmanship with such a narrow margin for extra profit (if any):

I have been hoping for &gt;2 years that you would have shown some leadership on the 1MB issue, knowing that it is inadequate long-term.
Yet, you never made a proposal that could be discussed, until the recent utxo mention. You said once that 1.1MB was "probably" ok.
Why are you prepared to see blocks max out the limit when we know there will be serious confirmation delays? (not to mention the wide open window for a flooding attack).
Why aren't you worried that this event will be very bad publicity, and will erode the confidence of full node users, and will probably *increase centralization*.
Why not get behind even a simple linear increase or dynamic limit?

You have been sitting on the fence for well over 2 years on the 1MB issue, and I hoped all the time that you would come up with your own proposal. I even proposed 3MB blocks in August 2014, and gave a case for it, which you replied to, but again to wave away the idea of change. So, even 3MB is not acceptable still? Will you come up with a proposal before the average block size noticeably affects confirmation times?

He was constructively discussing your proposal here


I have nothing but admiration for the work that you and Core Dev colleagues have done. I just don't want to see it diminished by hitting a hard limit, and I don't accept that is was hit in 2013 except on March 6th when there was a fuss over long delays and the mining pools needed to raise the soft limit.


A lot of those 50000 were cpus, notebook miners. Surely, a lot of the nodes remaining are far more robust and have more capacity.


I suggested 3MB a year ago which was reasonable then, still now, but even that low number seems unacceptable to Core Dev today. And a dynamic limit which works in the 2MB-3MB range seems to be something that would get wide agreement.

If Bitcoin is going to reach its goal of being a significant currency and payment system in the world economy then scaling up will have to be a combination of decentralized core improvements, as well as accepting that major federated or centralized services will be built around it.

At this rate it will be causing major periods of confirmation delays by the end of the year. Fees and the dust limit already regulate block sizes, so this limit has had no real historical effect. 
It is effectively a **time-bomb** waiting to hit the user-base when the average block size approaches it - and the ecosystem enters a new growth phase.
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:40:53
There is consensus about network messages, e.g. their structure. One node can't add extra information which would get its messages rejected by its peers, so they all need to run compatible software.
Because there is already consensus on the announcement of new blocks as &lt;=1MB. It should be possible to inherit that consensus with a controlled change (via block versions) such that block announcements &gt;1MB continue to be rejected by the majority of nodes, although the decompressed contents might be larger.

The goal is to support larger block sizes in order to grow Bitcoin usage. However, it recognizes that bandwidth usage is a significant factor, and raised often in the 1MB debate.
The main control on block sizes in this scenario:
A miner must fill his/her block with tx which are known to other nodes, i.e. &gt;95% of consensus unconfirmed tx.
If most full nodes only have 4000 tx in their mempools then blocks can't be found with more than those 4000 tx.

Well, I have been pointing out for 2 solid years that the temporary anti-spam block limit is a major risk to Bitcoin, as it will cripple its future capability to process real-world business.
In that time a lot of good altcoins have been developed, and the only thing that has Bitcoin so far ahead is its network effect from its first-mover status.
Leaving the limit unchanged, or allowing it to be hit before deciding what to do, will seriously damage its reputation and status, and relegate it to being the myspace of cryptocurrency.  
I have read the whole debate and hope that core dev agrees that while there is a risk with a larger limit, it is less of a risk than keeping a small limit.

Q; What is a conservative course of action?
A: Conservative action (for a successful enterprise) is always to maintain the status quo as much as possible in the face of necessary change. Because Bitcoin has prospered for 6 years the status quo is to maintain the network as it is now.
**Unfortunately, neither keeping the 1MB or increasing it can maintain the network how it is now!**
This is a dilemma, but all enterprises face dilemmas at some time: necessity for change from competition, customers, technology or regulation. So, a conservative position is to adapt to an external change while maintaining the status quo *as much as possible*.
Q; Why isn’t “doing nothing” the best approach?
A: Because “doing nothing” has no real fall-back plan. 
The fall-back plan for an increase to, say 20MB, is a later soft-fork down to 2 or 3MB. This may or may not become necessary, but at least it can be achieved smoothly. Think: duck paddling hard in a millpond.
If the 1MB limit is kept and causes mayhem to confirmation times, bad publicity etc, then the fall-back “plan” is a painful and panicked hard-fork. Think: duck going through the water-wheel.
Q: When is a hard-fork not a hard-fork?
A: When it is planned so long ahead that 100% of all software instances are upgraded before it takes effect.
In practice this can’t be achieved, but targeting 90+% is desirable and sufficient for a smooth transition.
Q: When is a hard-fork most painful?
A: When it is a rapid decision, forced by circumstances, and everyone has to upgrade in a very short time.
The more delay before acting causes a bigger downside when a fork becomes forced. 
Q: What about keeping the 1MB to put upward pressure on fees?
A: That is “Blockchain Economics”. Applying to the blockchain a false economic model of reality, i.e. an economic model which has a hard limit such as the zero-bound in Central Bank interest rate targeting which attempts to set the price of money in a fiat system, but fails in a deflationary economy.
When the rubber hits the road of this reality the result will be a rapid plateau in total fees and then an inexorable decline as users abandon the use of Bitcoin in favour of alternatives, and new cryptocurrency users keen on the future of money are forced to use alternatives from the get-go.
Q: OK, but I’m a determined fan of Blockchain Economics. When is it safe to try it?
A: It’s never safe because of the Trade-Off, but the best time is trying a soft-limit while the hard-limit is higher (safety valve), and when the network is small but viable, and no one is paying attention, such as the situation in 2012, Unfortunately, the time for this has gone because the Bitcoin market capitalisation is in the billions of dollars and the world’s press is closely watching.
Q: What is the Trade-Off?
A: A fundamental of Bitcoin is its confirmation cycle which averages 10 minutes. 
When blocks have extra space the transaction counts per block are highly variable, but any given unconfirmed transaction may expect confirmation in 10 minutes.  
When blocks are full transaction counts per block are stable, but the expected confirmation time for an unconfirmed transaction becomes highly variable.
Q: Is the benefit of very stable block sizes worth the cost of highly variable confirmation times?
A: No!
Q; When is a flooding or spamming attack on Bitcoin most effective and cheapest to execute?
A: When blocks are nearly always full. It is least effective and most expensive when blocks normally have lots of unused space.
Q: Can Bitcoin be a reserve / settlement currency with high-value users, primarily a store of value like an electronic gold?
A: Yes, but not when it can only handle 0.01% (a ten-thousandth) of the world’s transactions. Not when another cryptocurrency is handling even 1%, let alone 10%, 50% or 99.99% of the world’s transactions. Bitcoin can only become a true reserve currency and electronic gold *when it scales*. Otherwise this remains a dream, a mirage.
Q: What about bandwidth considerations?
A: Satoshi put the 1MB in place when there were no lightweight nodes and all users had to run a full node. That time is nearly five years ago. Global improvements in bandwidth mean that the overhead he allowed for, by selecting 1MB in 2010, is more like 4MB in 2015. 
Q: What about technical concerns such as growth of the UTXO set?
A: The smartest way to meet a challenge is to leverage it as an opportunity.
Example : Aligning the demand for blocks larger than 1MB with an incentive to maintain a cleaner UTXO set.
The complexity of this change needs to be weighed against the simplicity of a fixed limit (e.g. 20MB). Sometimes simplicity outweighs a leveraged gain.
Also, the UTXO set could be kept cleaner, as a stand-alone change: allowing free transaction space based upon reducing utxo (negative delta) instead of being based upon the number of days destroyed, which was to encourage old coins being spent, something less important.
Q. What are the implications for decentralisation, particularly: full node counts?
A. Full node counts have been in decline for several years, mostly because of the growth in SPV wallets and lightweight nodes, and mining pools (for minimizing variance), also the increase in blockchain size for users who won’t spend a few $100 on TB disks.
Many node owners are long-term investors and believers in Bitcoin as a major currency and payment system of the future. That is why they hang in there. They are waiting to see it scale and will run non-mining, non-commercial nodes to do it. If the status quo is destabilized (e.g. unstable confirmation times) then full node owners will switch off faster.
Full node counts would be improved by greater adoption and the future use of node payment services where non-mining nodes get micro-payments via off-chain channels for servicing the network.
*Keeping the 1MB, because it is the least conservative action, will accelerate the decline in full node counts.*
Q: What if someone makes a load of gigablocks?
A: They can’t. If the 1MB disappeared, the message size limit of about 32MB means that this is the maximum block size. Gigablocks are not possible until all nodes support set reconciliation ("bandwidth reduction scheme") such as in IBLT, and block segmentation software.
Q: Why not wait for off-chain solutions which can handle 100x the on-chain volume, like Lightning Networks?
A: There is no time for that, LN is still in the documentation and technical specification stages, also the LN opinion is that 1MB is too small for them in the event that a lot of payment channels need to be closed quickly. 32MB or even 20MB would be sufficient.

This needs repeating:
Just because the limit becomes 20MB does not mean the average block size ramps up at a faster rate.
At the rate of growth since mid-2012 it will be about 2021 before the average block reaches 20MB. Global bandwidth and data storage improvements, plus software improvements to Bitcoin should make this a lot more manageable than today.

Pierre Rochard is missing the important point that Bitcoin is still in its early adoption stage where it is expected that miners are subsidized by the block reward, which is effectively a tax on all existing Bitcoin holders. A block with 1000 tx is already paying miners &gt;$5 per tx. That is a pricey fee.
Once the block reward is much lower, say, 3.125 btc, then fees can take over the heavy lifting of being the miners main source of income. Gavin's bigger blocks allow this to happen organically, without trying to force the market.
At present fees are primarily effective just as an anti-spam measure.

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme because it has utility (intrinsic) value:
Consider that 1 bitcoin is equivalent to 1 share in the world's most advanced payment network. It can:
hold value which is not subject to counterfeiting
send value person-to-person anywhere in the world
value sent has been demonstrated up to $147 million equivalent
received within a few seconds, irrevocably confirmed in hours
negligible fees
no censorship or permissions
24/7, no bank holidays
perfect for internet use (unlike credit cards)
allows inbuilt escrow and multi-signatures
allows for software layers for registering transfers of any assets such as land
The potential of the payment system is huge and the market is determining $8 billion thus far. ~600 per share is pretty reasonable I think.

The beauty about 20MB is that it is large enough that it might not need changing for a long time!

incorrect. The 1MB does not create scarcity of block-space. That is a myth, otherwise blocks would have filled up a few years ago, and fees would be rising, not transaction volume. 
This limit is a particularly insidious bit of software because people *think* that it is doing something when it isn't really. Eventually it will have a major effect and the result will then be similar to a radical economic experiment on Bitcoin, one which already has proven not to work. 
When the 250KB soft-limit was constantly hit on March 6th, 2013, the result was significant delays in confirmations for many users which meant the mining pools had to increase the size quickly.

@_date: 2015-08-11 20:28:21
theymos, I respect all that you have done for Bitcoin, but on this issue you need to take a step back and re-examine your position.
Saying that I am "unbelievably wrong" could equally be levelled at your highly dismissive "a few miners in China". 
The Chinese miners have said in an open letter that they are OK with blocks up to 8MB. They did this as a *response* to the economic majority and significant dev opinion, saying they are OK with this as well. 
There is overwhelming evidence that the majority of users want main-chain scaling. Every single poll in 2.5 years on bct and reddit (dozens!) has a majority for &gt;1MB, also a majority of Bitcoin services and businesses support scaling - which is obvious as their business models are dead in the water otherwise. The majority are leading the way and the Chinese miners are concurring with their view.
A few times in the last 2 years you said that that you were OK with an increase in the limit, (I recall that about 3 or 4MB was mentioned). So you *were* in agreement that a moderate increase is  sensible. Will you confirm that this is still true, or are you now firmly for keeping 1MB4EVR, or are you behind Pieter's draft BIP, or have some other view entirely?
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:53:13
LTC @ $4 and FTC @ 0.7 of a cent. Looks like an alt coin with a zombie fork. Consensus is 99.8% that only LTC is viable. Seems like a real consensus there.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:36:12
I appreciate your detailed explanation, however it is fundamentally flawed where it says XT is an alt coin. 
XT will function the same as Core (except a few minor patches) until it has 75% mining support. This is Bitcoin both before and afterwards, and anyone who wants to keep mining a weak orphan chain can do that any day at any point. 
Also, this change is returning Bitcoin closer to the original version which had a 32MB limit. And by your definition of alt-coin the current chain is an alt-coin from the point Satoshi put in the 1MB which he did on his own authority with no consensus from other devs.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:19:31
The Chinese miners wrote an open letter about the block size limit, saying what size they could handle. Since then KNC, 21, Slush and other major miners all totalling 60+% of the hashing power have voiced a similar view. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:43:00
I welcome Pieter's proposal as I have huge respect for all that he has done in core dev. In fact I have been waiting 2.5 years to see what he thinks should be done about this problem.
He has moved away from his initial position, and that shows he has an open mind to this debate. 
Now, I do consider that his ramping schedule is high-risk because block congestion crippling ecosystem growth is highly likely before his schedule has much if any effect. I am hoping that he will consider a more conservative plan of ramping from an earlier point e.g. mid-2010.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:19:34


You have to be joking! Explain why Core is so against increasing the block limit to 8MB with the doubling schedule (which obviously can't have any effect beyond 32MB without further changes).
Have I got this right?: Core Dev is so against 8MB that they would probably run with an orphan fork with just 10% of the hashing power and ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:14:24
Agreed. Even 21-25% starting from 1MB at mid-2010, would allow some reasonable head-room for growth, unlike from Jan 2017 which just poses too much near-term risk to the ecosystem network effect.

The Chinese are still hoping for a compromise, and that is why Pieter's BIP is very welcome (although personally I think it should start the ramp from mid-2010 when the 1MB was put in).
When legitimate ecosystem growth is being hampered by the block size limit, plus pressure from the reward halving, then the Chinese will probably give up waiting for Core to resolve the issue alone.

Bitcoin has forks every day, when orphans are created. They are temporary but each time &gt;50% of the hashing power has to decide which is the chain to continue to have valuable bitcoins for the ecosystem to use.
I suspect that if XT users become a majority and a &gt;1MB block is mined, it will be because users of Core have decided to keep the blocks crippled for too long and have driven away too much legitimate ecosystem usage. It is they who will be forking themselves off from the majority and trying to build on what is effectively an orphan block, i.e. by ignoring the hashing majority behind the first &gt;1MB block.

Correct. Any fork of Bitcoin with &gt;50% hashing power (PoW) is the one valid instance of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:00:50
Indeed. Even buying time with an increase to 3MB is a smart move. The important thing is not to cripple the network effect, allowing time to leverage software and hardware improvements which are "in the pipeline" without disruption.

@_date: 2015-07-16 06:15:22
Correct. I am amazed that some people can't see this, or simply don't care. The "Bitcoin as a settlement currency" dream gets shattered when ordinary users find BTC unusable for any reasonable fee. Inevitable if and when real-world volume demands 1.5MB per block. Proving that fees can price out a spammer's tx is not a "solution" to handling future organic growth.
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:45:46

@_date: 2015-07-30 21:29:59
Correct. This proposal is similar to not increasing the limit at all, it plays into the Bitcoin as a "settlement layer" fantasy, which won't happen when other similar crypto can massively undercut Bitcoin for tx fees.

And furthermore the block limit has had zero to do with node count decreasing. Until 2015 that is when its effects will kick in and serve to accelerate node count decline by driving away new users and upsetting existing users with unpredictable confirmation times.

All alternatives to an ever increasing main-chain block size are welcome  if they leverage Bitcoin. 
However, there its one important caveat: the alternatives must *prove themselves attractive to the market on their own merit*. They can't succeed if the main-chain is crippled and users are being forced away through bad UX.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:01:33
A will pay the miners far more than B.
In fact, when the block reward drops to 6.25 BTC in 5 years time, if the average block size is 20MB then the tx fees will equal the block reward. This allows fees to replace rewards. Keeping the 1MB kills off a viable fee-market.

@_date: 2015-07-24 10:12:14
You aren't neutral Luke, because you want the limit to artificially force up fees, to squeeze out spam. That is using the 1MB way beyond its original purpose, which was as a sanity check against blocks 1000x the average size at a time before SPV wallets, when all users needed to run a full nodes.
The fundamental flaw of keeping the 1MB until the market proves that it is causing harm is that it leaves zero time for a smooth hard-fork.
The whole point of decentralisation is that change should be slow and not forced on all nodes in a few days or weeks. A "fast-fork" is the fastest way to kill off the greatest number nodes at once. Expect a dogs-leg down move in the chart of full node counts if the 1Mb change is delayed until the market is screaming for it and the fork has to be done under panic conditions.
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:57:20
The are 1000 ideas about how to increase the block size limit.
The problem is that the Core developers cannot come to a consensus on *any* change, and some of them think that it can wait another 2 years.
Some of them are under the delusion that the Bitcoin ecosystem is robust enough that users can be forced to pay ever higher fees for block space, perhaps even 50c, $1, or $5 per transaction.
The reality is that while there is some upward flexibility in the market for fees (and we saw this during the recent spam attack), that they will cause one of two outcomes:
a) most Bitcoin users, particularly NEW users will experiment with altcoins, until one of them gets a critical mass of users to drive its value up and make Bitcoin the MySpace of crypto
or b) 
other Core Dev will release a patched version of Core for larger blocks and the majority of miners and users will move across to it, but unfortunately there will be a lot of hysterics, bad PR, price volatility (down more than up) until ecosystem stability is restored.
Yes, handling blocks &gt;1MB is going to introduce new technical challenges, but Bitcoin cannot succeed even medium-term with this limit left in place.
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:15:20
Good summary, however B can only happen if A occurs to a significant extent.
The Core Dev experiment in changing Bitcoin by artificially capping the block size will cripple A such that B has zero chance of happening.
The only scenario where B works without A is a world where only 1 cryptocurrency can exist. 
Because Bitcoin can be cloned many times, and each clone-coin attracts its own hashing power, then it is inevitable that one of them will achieve A, and then it will obtain B as well, leaving Bitcoin as the Netscape or MySpace of crypto *IF* the experiment of keeping the 1MB is played out to its conclusion.

a) they don't seem to give a shit that it is inevitable that legitimate user transactions will be priced away from direct access to the blockchain, 
b) that it will happen far sooner than LN or any other off-chain solutions are up and running to seamlessly handle this user demand.
c) that this event will give massive amounts of oxygen and legitimacy to alternatives like Etherium, Monero and Litecoin.
d) that they are happy to pretend that a chain with 75% of the hashing power is not the chain with most work that should be followed by all nodes, and will childishly FUD and wring their hands about the lack of some unquantifiable amount of consensus. 
e) they pretend to forget that Bitcoin is a PoW architecture, and need to deal with it.

Transaction throughput is the key to success. Crippling throughput will cause centralization by stalling ecosystem growth, driving away users, lowering the price and discourage people who run full nodes.

For BIP100 it is unclear whether the activation threshold is 90% or 95%:




A simple plumbing change in Bitcoin's code was allowed to fester until it became a divisive community issue causing long and acrimonious debate and now entrenched opinion. This means that a small bloc of miners could prevent activation of BIP100 long after transaction volumes are hopelessly crippled. Having an activation threshold is a big improvement in BIP100 over the original "flag day" which opened up the insane risk of a 50/50 network split.
IMHO an activation threshold of 80% is warranted and should see BIP100 deployed smoothly (as many hold-outs upgrade before the next difficulty change), and allow Bitcoin to continue its growth success story into the future.
The 32MB is less of a concern as this may be best solved with Tier Nolan / Adam Back extension blocks (if it also proves a seriously divisive change).
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:01:36
This is not just completely correct, but so obviously correct, that those who do not want the situation remedied are wanting Bitcoin to undergo a state change to a different model e.g. "settlement layer"
This is a hopelessly naive gamble with a large probability of failing and strangling the network effect.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:11:08


Simply that Bitstamp will be following the large blocks chain when the 75% mining threshold is reached. Anyone trying to sell block rewards from the fast waning 25% fork will find that the network won't relay these new coins to Bitstamp.

Well, you have to trust that greed is harnessed. i.e. that the economic majority won't agreed to &gt;21M coins, that the miners will want to maximise personal profit so will not generate too many excessive blocks which will eventually affect usage and depress the BTC price. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 09:56:05
Correct, but this level is more like 75+% because miners will always create small or empty blocks even when 100,000 reasonable fee-paying tx are stacked up in the mempool
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:59:06
I believe that the "upside" of RBF is that it enables users to compete for block space when the 1MB limit is being constantly hit, and this is the reason it is being pushed forward now.
I fully agree with Mike's position, and his article explains well how RBF-SE is seriously flawed. In theory RBF can be useful to users, but implementing what is proposed will be a disaster, just as leaving the 1MB limit in place will be another disaster.
@_date: 2016-05-26 00:19:31
What's a worse problem than blocks being full? Blocks being empty! 
If there is ever too much volume that it degrades the network the miners will moderate their block sizes. It's time to trust them to do the right thing which is find the balance between tx demand and the safe level of capacity for supply of block-space.
@_date: 2015-10-17 09:52:29
Blocks at 90+% of the maximum for 7 days is an extreme event which will mean that Bitcoin is unusable for many people. While the block reward is large there will always be miners who churn out small or empty blocks which means the likely sustainable size is nearer 75%. Pain will be happening all the way beyond it.
A "brownout" situation exists above 75% because legitimate user transactions will not be confirmed in any reasonable time period.
Red is 60-75% because spare capacity is disappearing.
For mainstream IT systems 40% capacity usage is an alert level for upgrading, more so for market-facing systems where external demand can be very variable.
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:18:01


As says: users will pay for their demand, so there is no arbitrary protocol limit that can be considered equivalent to an economic limit.
Consider that there are 2 types of Bitcoin transaction:
C or "Care tx" the user pays a fee, expects a money-moving service, and actually cares about prompt confirmation.
D or "Don't Care tx" the user pays, but is spamming, advertising, or stress-testing, and doesn't care about whether confirmation occurs.
This means that there are 3 types of blocks, C, D and a CD mixture. In practice we only see CD blocks, however the ratio C/D in each block is variable, but also immeasurable.
Core Dev and many 1MBers think that there is an unquantifiable amount of D that can be squeezed out (raising the CD ratio) as real-world ecosystem growth continues, by using a hard block limit (L). They also think that this reduces centralisation pressures by keeping blocks smaller than otherwise, even though centralisation pressure has historically been due to users choosing SPV/web wallets and pool mining; not due to the average block size.
So, although there have been periods of blocks averaging &gt;900KB the likelihood is that these have not yet had a very high percentage of C type tx. The network can hum along with full CD blocks where the ratio is not too high (as seen in stress-tests), but as sustained C approaches L then damage results (affecting PR, price, etc).


75% is a guesstimate based upon the number of small blocks seen during periods when the network is heavily spammed. I fully agree that more metrics are worthwhile, and confirmation delay at minfee would be an interesting graph.

The limit needs to be increased soon, as it is effectively a massive untested change which will cripple throughput. The only similar event was on March 6, 2013, and a lot of users had problems.


 Not true. Confirmations need to happen on the known probabilistic schedule. 
The network can easily handle 2MB, probably 5MB blocks. By the time real-world business fill these, then "set reconciliation" IBLT, will be implemented and will slash new blocks to 1/100th size.

1MB is a hard limit, so it is where stress tests shouldn't be done, because everyone has to upgrade at once if the stress test is too stressful. It's like stress-testing a steam engine with the safety valve welded shut.
There was a soft-limit stress test at 250KB which lasted about a day before delays in confirmations caused a lot of user complaints. 500KB was another opportunity which did not last.
If a 1MB stress test is to be done, then it needs to be a soft-limit and the block hard-limit needs to be higher first.

I do know what they are, but here is the logical problem. If they are secured by merge-mining then they cannot be a solution to handling higher volumes. The reason is that the same miners are mining the SC and the MC. 
Gavin has already discovered that one 20MB block has 4x faster io (probably disk io) than twenty 1MB blocks. So there are economies of scale.
These economies are lost if volume is spread over one or more SC and a MC when the same decentralized network is used.

He is. 
1% is a working number for estimating IBLT block sizes. So a full 20MB new block announcement would be 200KB. In practice they might be a fixed size, say 500KB, which would handle up to 50MB blocks, although future efficencies in prediction of which unconfirmed transactions have best consensus would allow IBLT further capabilities.

There is a flaw in the video which means Japan has more time than might be expected (not that they will use the time wisely).
The flaw is that when interest rates rise to 4% it does not apply to all government debt immediately, only new debt. A lot of existing debt will be on 0.5% for 10 or 20 year terms (or similar). 
So, Japan has quite a few extra years to get its finances in order - but it won't. BOOM anyway.

The website and video is highly misleading. Worse it was created to further a personal agenda even if it cripples the use of Bitcoin by millions of people. 
The author of the website and also producer of the video has designed a system which makes Bitcoin banks workable. However, he wants to force 99% of bitcoin transactions through such banks by limiting the main blockchain to these banks and other rich users - similar to the Fedline computer system. Frankly, this is against the whole spirit of this revolutionary new currency and payments system
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:07:22

"The only way this trend could ever change seems to be with significantly larger transaction fees or greatly reduced mining difficulty. Neither of those seems very likely."
That's because what will happen instead (assuming current trend), is the volume of transactions will keep increasing and eventually the total fees will exceed the block rewards. 
At the moment fees are about 2 or 3% of the block reward. So 50x transaction volume hits the crossover point. Software changes to optimize block handling need to happen to enable such scaling, but are do-able.

It's actually an inflationary currency, quickly becoming stable over a couple of decades. The only thing that makes it seem deflationary is the rapid fx gain bitcoin has in the adoption phase. In a worldwide bitcoin economy the deflationary effects would be solely from GDP gain.
Most GDP gain in OECD countries for the last 20 or 30 years has been fictitious because of pulled forward production and demand by a massive debt bubble growing far larger than real GDP. 
So, in a stable (inflexible) monetary system the amount of deflation would be real falling prices and real gain in living standards. It would be fantastic not to have the massive dislocations from mis-allocated capital and credit and see a reducing wealth gap, and boom/bust cycles which are purely a function of technological change, not economic mismanagement by CBs and govts.

I don't think FRB is possible with Bitcoin. Same as for gold. All you can do is create extra paper claims to someone else's bitcoins.
Fiat is created by banks doing loans because fiat credit money is exactly the same as government issued fiat money.  Bitcoin is different because BTC deposited at a bank have to leave when a loan is made. The bank can't pretend to have them anymore. So there is no multiplier effect which is what FRB does.
