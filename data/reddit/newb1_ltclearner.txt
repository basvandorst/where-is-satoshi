I would buy 4 million Litecoin and I would build a significantly better version of LinkedIn - deploying within it Litecoin, of course. I would buy and hold some Vericoin too.

Choice is a good thing and options are necessary for choice to occur. 
Soon, I hope, it will be possible to easily purchase Litecoins with U.S. Dollars (and euros/loonies/etc). The pursuit of Litecoin often creates demand for Bitcoin because they must (typically) be purchased along the way. For example, I buy Bitcoin on Coinbase. I then move Bitcoin to an exchange where I buy Litecoin. It will be interesting to see what happens to the Litecoin price when that stop-over need not occur.

Purpose requires consciousness.  It is, therefore, meaningless to speak of the purpose in things.  To know purpose is to speak with any user of a thing.  I use Litecoin as a learning and teaching tool.  I use Litecoin as a speculative investment.  I use Litecoin for transacting.  I use Litecoin as a social device.  Speak with others, you'll find additional purpose for Litecoin.
I have been involved in the Litecoin community since November 2013 and I find it to be rather diverse and not, as a whole, especially sucky.
The Litecoin subreddit is dead?  Here I wonder if you lack the perception to make an accurate judgment or if you chose to exaggerate your judgment to fit within your broader, negative judgement of Litecoin.
It amazes me that you should qualify a 124 million dollar network as a waste.
I quite like the logo.  There are efforts underway to revise it... which, I do not favor.  The logo attracted me.
You believe the only good in Litecoin is mining dogecoin?  Seriously?  I can't take you seriously when you say that. Nope.

Was I? The reception on this subreddit seems pretty ambivalent... Whatever the case, it was a good documentary film and one I think any crypto-involved person would enjoy.

You're working with an interesting definition of "bs". That's for sure.

What motivates egifter to take this action?

Defending this bitcoin clone?  I posted a review of my experience with The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.  You proceeded to qualify Litecoin as BS and you explained your definition of BS in ways that do not appear to be especially careful, clear, accurate, or precise.
To quote Donald Clifton, "Criticism has the power to do good when there is something that must be destroyed, dissolved or reduced, but [it is] capable only of harm when there is something to be built.”
I challenge you to recognize that Litecoin and a diversity of other altcoins have their place in the crypto-ecosystem that is being built.  The great diversity of builders in this community should be working together, taking seriously the use of social skills that respect diversity.  Money deserves no less.  Money is the ultimate tool in achieving respect for diversity.  It's a shame to fall short of this.

Yes, why?

Might we see litecoin on Mobi sometime in the near future?
@_date: 2016-12-02 13:32:32
Agreed. "Transfer" would be a better indicator than sale.

It's only lying when there's intent to deceive. I don't think Coinbase intends to deceive, rather I think they have chosen a rather inaccurate way of representing the data.

This is an incomplete first draft of the survey report. I thought it better to share this as is, than to keep it hidden any longer.
I hope you find it as interesting as I do. Feedback and questions are welcome and especially so in the near term; as I will be able to consider this as I more deeply analyze the data and redraft. Big thanks to everyone who contributed responses!
Here's the report.
Yes, this is my first infographic.

For all the same reasons people consider any other occupations and industries. There is an executive process that engages decision making skills that implement the fit between self and options. This fit involves interests, values, skills, abilities, beliefs, cognitive and behavioral preferences, attitudes, and motivations.

Thank you for the suggestion. Shift's response: 	
Thanks for your inquiry. And, for your interest in the Shift Card.
Unfortunately, we are currently only able to issue cards to individuals, not businesses. So, I'm sorry I won't be able to make one out to your not-for-profit organization.
Sorry for the less than optimal feedback. Thank you for your understanding.
Maybe I asked the wrong person at Shift??

Should the opportunity present itself, I will surely do so.

Criticism has the power to do good when there is something that must be destroyed, dissolved or reduced, but it is capable only of harm when there is something to be built. Are you involving yourself in cryptocurrency to be a builder? Are you producing value with your efforts?
Charlie is not just another scammer. Charlie is a worker and he is producing significant value for the community, his employer, his family, and himself. I applaud him and his team for their good purpose, best practices, and search thereof.
Cheers to you, Charlie. Keep up the good work!
