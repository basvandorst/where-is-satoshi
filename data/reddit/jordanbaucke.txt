There is a risk of the exchange / holder of the original priv. key issuing more of an asset. So a trusted 3rd party would have to hold the key so long as to prevent the original issuer from creating more "Shares" of whatever and selling those (thus increasing the supply)

Trading is a form of gambling. "Investing" is just another term for low-risk gambling. "Investing" in a massive bond-fund that if it loses have it's value you've got bigger problems than your margin account balance... I think your situation puts you way past splicing words.

It's not completely trustless. You have to "trust" the original issuer _NOT TO ISSUE_ more shares with the same private key.

Consider that $55k, now consider how you'd feel if you lost that. You need to take a deep breath and consider how important that remaining $55k is in a _checking/savings account_ - that could be the difference between being totally destitute if an emergency arises or having it going away.
Nobody _knows_ where the price is going except down in a bear market. If your within earshot of a margin-call, you need to actively reduce your exposure, and plan to buy back lower. I know it's counter intuitive, but you need to _manage the position_ like a trader would.

I'm not sure about actually seeding the addresses directly in nodejs. 
I've setup a 'cold wallet' from armory, load that into armoryd and get a theoretically unlimited (?) number of addresses from it via WS calls to armoryd (which you could do in NodeJS via JSONRPC). 
This maybe the quickest - most secure solution going that I'm aware of - if someone else has better documentation that I haven't seen.
It's not quiet "deterministic" - but given current implementations you can do that with Electrum, but I haven't done that as the documentation was kind of scant on doing it - and Armoryd offered it a bit more "out of the box" - drop me a line and I can help you out.

It's my understanding that **operating a tor exitnode** is *risky business* in most jurisdictions. While it might be perfectly legal for a user to offer their internet connection *as a gateway to others* you run the risk of being accused of being responsible for the content requests you make on behalf of the network.
Taking a form of payment for this might increase the stakes as well...I don't see any indication the kinds of concerns this could create for casual users.

evoorhees now lives in Panama - but I'd assume he's still responsible for filing his taxes here in the US and declaring his assets to US authorities (as a US Citizen) and any capitol gains taxes paid to the companies' home domiciles authorities. None-of-which would necessarily be public record, but one has to wonder what that situation is like.

I think it's important to remember that Chinese "firms" have a long history of manipulating or misrepresenting figures, products, etc. I'm not saying that Mr. Lee's company is fraudulent, but it's prudent for investors to understand that a great deal of new "Chinese Exchanges" are most likely nothing more than fabrications with little or no real "volume" to speak of.

I'm saying that if a large retailer might want to get into Bitcoin that's great! But I don't think they wouldn't do it like the rest of the "community" - IE they would **hire their own miner** and when they had a business meeting with that miner, the would say: *"We can't do this if it's anonymous! We've got too much to lose, how can you help?"*, miner responds: *"I can taint the coins, and you can buy more mining resources for cheaper than processing credit cards!"* I also argued I thought 51% attacks are a *bridge too far*, and this was just a theory so I would suggest people comment and explain to me why it wouldn't be possible!

Check out [Bitfinex]( - they have BTCUSD, BTCLTC, LTCUSD pairs, a margin trading platform. Lending, order routing to Bitstamp, and free withdrawals of BTC, LTC and cheap, fast withdraws of other currency via SWIFT Wire transfer.

I'm more reassured about their platform after speaking with one of their advisors. The web-ui needs some work, and there are people trolling on bitcointalk - though their internal security protocol seems sound.

This will never happened. Why would any government whom currently participates in the centralized financial system (or the governments whom use it) want to use an anonymous transactional system? 
More likely that they would *first* work with miners to **taint the coin system** until the anonymous bitcoins were worth much less, and people adopted a tainted, or carefully controlled system.

If your sick of Mt.Gox consider moving to Bitfinex -  I've been using their platform for a while, it allows you to trade there and on BitStamp at the same time. They also have Litecoin, and features like margin trading, shorting, and lending.

SWIFT Interbank wire-transfers are still largely executed manually by banks in the US.
Tomorrow is a US holiday, and Friday will be low-staffed going into the weekend, so even if they start executing wires, they may not be credited to US customers until after the holiday weekend.

I know Charles (the creator) personally. Well I don't have a long history with him, I don't believe it's a ponzi scheme) I do know that he's working very hard at what he's doing.

In reading your post, it seems that you were banking with CHASE. Is that correct? It's my understanding that other BTC related companies have their money with them, and haven't had the same problems (yet).
Of course CHASE is a monstrosity of an institution - so it's highly unlikely that any two situations have the exact same result. 
However, this should be very concerning for other BTC businesses that use CHASE.

Lack of the ability to move money between exchanges. It's a simple liquidity problem. The time value of moving the money is greater than the potential risk of being unable to move it in the market during the transfer.
