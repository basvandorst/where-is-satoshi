Ouch :(
Just give it time.  One day you'll all look back and laugh about that time your wife wanted to kill you in your sleep bc bitcoin

Wat r u waring
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:12:56
I know it's not funny, but that's such an oddly specific amount.
I'd be horrified too
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:55:31
Why not?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:07:58
Sure, but you'll spend an exorbitant amount of fees to do so
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:06:46
I'm 12, and non binary, so none of this makes sense to me
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:36:02
PayPal?  
But honestly, if you're only gonna sell $20 a month, you'd be better off keeping it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:42:53
Screenname checks out
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:33:49
Thank you for the explanation :)
It's gonna be interesting to see what survives.   I know I'm probably gonna lose my ass on alts, but honestly it was a fun ride
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:03:16
It's not just you, I started yesterday, and already lost essentially $35 out of a $100 purchase (long story) just by converting it and moving to a new wallet.
There's resources out there, but even with that it's pretty daunting.  Not to mention the nerves that come from sending my last $100 to ....space I guess?
I seriously sat down for 8 hours yesterday researching crypto, finding market sites, etc...I'm still mostly clueless, but I guess my transaction kinda worked?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:24:14
I've had several so far today, and am starting to get frustrated.
Do you know if there's a way to buy directly through kraken (I'm in the US)?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:08:46
What's ln?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:39:05
No worries fren, I always bounce back :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:12:31
Well....dammit.    I was kinda counting on btc failing, in the hopes the others would take off.
Is there a safe (crypto) way to hedge one's bets?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:41:49
You're the best kind of person :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:35:48
Waiting on it to get added to binance :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:35:00
Losing 200k would make me peel my own skin off.
Sorry fren, I hope you get it resolved
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:48:01
I live in a singlewide trailer, ration my food,  and drive an 06 maxima....How much more am I supposed to sacrifice lol?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:46
That would truly be some shit.  I'm poor as fuck and didn't get in the game quick enough
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:56:50
Even the other currencies (monero, ethereum, etc)?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:08:06
Is coinbase back up?  That's who I tried to use at first, but transactions were suspended
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:26:23
So what if I can't get the money out?  I tried to send it to electrum but no luck yet
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:36:33
Do you know of another way I can get my ptsd meds?  I'm game for whatever lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:29:47
That's good info,  I'll try to find a market that takes one of those.  Thankie
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:45:38
I cashed out of bitcoin and put everything into other cryptos.  It's (probably) more risky, but the fees are way more reasonable, and I have a feeling btc's bubble will pop in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:37:42
Drivers license pic and your last utility bill
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:08:53
Is there really still money in coding?  
I ask because I'm probably getting sent home on disability in a few months...which is basically 60% of what I'm making now :(
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:33:09
Whoa I thought it was taxed...this changes things :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:09:17
Thank you, I didn't even realize this was an option :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:09:20
Shit I was too...I finally got it to send.  They're still charging like 19% for transfers, even on the slowest setting
Thank you anyway, pardon my noobness :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:49:00
Your best bet is localbitcoins.com.  I got mine from a friend, but I way overpaid to compensate him
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:43:08
Ah shit...I fall into category 3.  Could be worse though :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:29:42
I have, when I needed it in a hurry and couldn't provide enough ID for verification
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:25:31
I just used bitcoin.coms wallet...in hindsight, that was probably a mistake.
I tried to send it to electrum, as that's what the vendor prefers, but no luck
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:39:26
Any advice for the po folks living paycheck to paycheck?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:57:54
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:59:28
I made my first purchase yesterday...definitely leave it in there.  Between the transaction fees and bouncing around...I kinda got screwed
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:40:27
Hey can someone let me borrow $9500?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:05:30
Beautiful idea if true, but Google didn't turn up any results.  Is there a website?
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:44:48
Subbed because I'm having the same issue
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:01:25
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:44:09
That's fair, as I'd rather spend the rest of my life with a goat than two hours with her
