well, even visa/credit card is not quite popular in Vietnam, why are you talking about Bitcoin?

I would love to know what are the specific ideas...

The ``math" that the author performed to prove the attack is bogus. I and my colleague from National University of Singapore have analysed the attack again to show where and why the author is wrong in this reasoning. Details of our analysis can be found below.
For ease with algebraic
manipulation, I'll abbreviate the parameters of the attack:
a = fraction of bogus transactions generated by the attacker per block
m = per block mining reward
p = probability the attacker successfully extends a block
t = total transaction fees per block with attacker spam
t_0 = total transaction fees per block without attacker spam
The expected reward per block using the attack is then:
p[(1-a)t + m] + (1-p)(-at) = pt - pat + pm - at + pat = pt + pm - at
and without the attack it the expected reward is pt_0 + pm, for a net
difference of
pt - at - pt_0 = p(t - t_0) - at.
So the attack is profitable iff p(t - t_0) &gt; at.  Clearly the success
of the attack depends on the parameter t - t_0, so "anything that the
traffic will bear, as long as it keeps blocks more than half full of
real transactions" is not good enough.  If the attacker can't raise
the transaction fee, then he is screwing himself with this attack.
The article claims that there is a "breakeven" point when p + (1-a) =
1, or p = a.  p = a is only a "breakeven" point when t_0 = 0.  He also
considers an example where a = 1/3 and p = 1/2.  Here the expected
difference is t/6 + t_0/2, so the attack would only be profitable in
case the attacker manages to increase the transaction fees by more
than 3-fold using a = 1/3.  The author seems to implicitly assume that
t_0 is negligible, but I don't think that's a reasonable assumption.

Thanks for the great work!

 is right, they don't have to steal your private keys to have your bitcoins. What they can do is to have you surrounded by all their fake nodes, send you some bitcoins to buy some stuff from you, you wait and see the transaction is confirmed by the fake nodes and send the item to them. However, they spend the coin sent to you in another transaction which the fake nodes don't broadcast to you, thus making your previously confirmed transaction invalid to the whole network.

Electrum is awesome. They support many OSes: I have installed their wallets on my Mac, my Linux Workstation and my Android phone as well.

If this is the case, then it is a bigger news than Wright being Satoshi Nakamoto.
