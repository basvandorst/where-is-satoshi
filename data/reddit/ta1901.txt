Thanks for clarifying. I thought BTC gave some fees to nodes that didn't mine. 


Is that just a new release of the same Ethereum but changed to POS?

Do you know which coins pay for full nodes that don't mine?

Well, there it is! (kidding)

I am on one exchange that can cash out from BTC to fiat, and then I can transfer that to my bank. 
There's a law in the US that says if you make a transaction in or out of a bank more than $5000-10000, then it will be logged. It's some type of anti-terrorism act. 
Also keep in mind that the FDIC only insures the first $250,000 for each bank account. But that's in case the bank collapses. So you might want to put it into multiple bank accounts, or talk to a financial advisor. 
Fidelity.com has a money market account that you might put the money into, and you can write checks from it. I don't know what type of insurance Fidelity has, but it's been a solid company for 20+ years. You can also put the money into a Fidelity bond fund, mutual fund, or something else. I don't do single stocks myself.

IMO, coins that are cheaper per unit are more affordable than BTC at $14,000. People might think if they buy more individual coins, they will get a higher return overall.

Most people don't have any  money to invest, and if they do, most of them just don't care to take the time to learn about something new. Many people still don't understand mutual funds, which is why so many people go with annuities (with high fees and low returns).

Yes, I just finished downloading on Jan 5. It look about 5 days. Download speed was a bit variable according to, I assume, traffic on the Bitcoin network. My max internet connection speed is 35mb/s, that doesn't mean that's the throughput I'll get from the Bitcoin Core.
Once you start downloading the block chain you have to leave that program on 24/7. Did you do that? 
Is your internet connection good? What's your max internet speed?

[Here's a table]( showing exchanges, if they support USD or other fiat, and which coins they support.

[Cool crypto box map from the article](
I think we'll continue to see good gains in some cryptos in 2018, thought maybe not as dramatic as we just had in 2017. Overall I think cryptos will generally do better than mutual funds this year. As exchanges support more and more cryptos, the average person will try them out more and more. And I think that will push the price up on some cryptos.

That's not bad when some mutual funds have front or back-end loads (fees) of 1-3%. 
Never invest in anything if you can't afford to lose all you invest.

During high volume this can take a while for the transaction to show up. This might be because the exchange site itself is under heavy load, or the BTC network is under heavy load.
A few months ago there was one exchange were it was taking some transactions 2-4 weeks to show up! Not sure if everyone got their money or not.

Well, if there are fewer and fewer bitcoins left to mine, will that cause the price to go up as the number of coins left to mine gets lower and lower? I think the price will go up.

Oh heck no, I don't think it will decrease consumerism. While some Millennials are getting better with managing their money, most people, of all generations, are not. Lots of Americans, and those in Western society, are all about "feel good now and fck the future" spending.
Hopefully you can see this [Fred graph]( of consumer debt as percent of income. And it's rising again, like in past bubbles. Some people have learned to decrease their debt since the peak of 2001. But I wouldn't say the majority of people care much to reduce their debt. Tabular [data is here]( since 1980.
This "consumer debt" appears to include [mortgages and credit cards]( Unfortunately there is data only to April 2017, so FRED is quite behind for some reason. 
I do think cryptocurrency will get more popular because more and more people realize how economies are manipulated by big banks and institutional investors seeking boom/bust scenarios for personal profit.

Is there any server where I can get crypto price data via a Perl API?

I believe Bitcoin is in a bubble right now and could drop significantly in the next 12 months. So I made a little money, got out of BTC, and will wait for the drop to buy again. 
The economy goes in a mania and recession cycle, and I believe we are near the top of the mania.

You bet. A person has options when they have cash, or cash equivalents. Someone with little or no cash, has little or no option. That's why an emergency fund of $5000+ is a good idea. It can help with most disasters.

That in itself is totally irrational and not a real world scenario. I'm talking about *saving* money (putting it in the bank vs spending it), you're talking about *growing* money to beat inflation. Those are 2 different things. I never said putting money in the bank would beat inflation, or increasing medical costs, or cost of living. 
IMO saving money means putting money in the bank, and not spending it, it doesn't mean the savings account interest rate will beat inflation. 
Choosing to put a $1 in the bank vs spending that $1 is a choice. 
No one should rely on savings accounts to beat inflation. They won't. 
The banking system is broken. 
If someone is too lazy to learn about investing in other things besides a savings account, that's also a choice. Cryptocurrency has done well for me, much better than any savings account, that's why I use it as an investment.
I have money in many different instruments. Because I chose to not spend it, it has grown and I have more  options now. That is a rational choice.

Yes, the US system does not encourage savings *in banks*. A 0.5% annual return on a savings account is virtually  nothing compared to 20 years of stagnant wages and ever-increasing out of pocket expenses, especially medical expenses. However no one makes another person spend all his money and  not save. That's their choice. Despite the paltry interest rates on savings, people can still choose to save, or not. And they can do it with different financial instruments.
If one is waiting for the system to "encourage" them, they will be waiting for a long time. The US system is broken and will likely stay that way. That means there will be little or no encouragement to save from the governments for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to know too. Perhaps you can limit the bandwidth speed a bitcoin node uses via the bitcoin node software, or the OS itself, like someone can limit the speed of their torrent software as a whole.
Anyone have any info on starting a node? I might have a spare PC.
Is a raspberry Pi a bad idea to be a node as long as it has 20mbps?
