Lightning is designed to work as your wallet. Think of Bitcoin on the blockchain as being in the bank, and on a channel as being in your wallet.  Do you go to the bank everytime you buy coffee, or pay your friend? Is your friend going to go deposit that $10 immediately? No.
Once you have a few channels open, you'll leave them open and occasionally refill then (hitting the ATM), or empty then (making a deposit).

Yeah, the code on any given node works fine, but the network behavior is not as intended.  Common in large systems.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:05:27
The change is an output like any other.
You can spend unconfirmed outputs, but the new transactions can't confirm until the earlier one does (ie. the same or a subsequent block).
You can use this to your advantage by using a new (child) transaction with a very high fee to pay enough per combined byte to get the old (parent) transaction confirmed too. (Child Pays for Parent, CPFP).

If I understand it correctly, they are claiming that FRNs are a promise to pay to the bearer a fraction of the future GDP of the USA, but that's completely false.  The Federal Reserve Bank, a semi-private bank, issues the money, not the US government. The money is no more backed by the GDP than Bitcoin (ie. each is worth exactly as much output as another party is willing to trade for it). The only practical differences in backing are: USD are issued and destroyed by the decisions of politicians and bankers where Bitcoin are issued based on your decisions of a decentralized network of coders and nodes; and USD can be used to settle any debt governed by US law.

Totally misunderstands money, especially highly divisible money like Bitcoin.  With non money goods, the supply needs to fluctuate with demand, but with money (as the unit of account) the relative price is all that needs to change to adapt to changing demand, as long as the money is divisible enough.
Bitcoin may some day need to divide below the Satoshi, which can be done either off chain or as a hard fork.

I'm sure of my statements. The "mostly" means there's some amount of non crypto data in there, and the on disk representation may include added metadata (eg. indices) that are more compressible in order to support the local node, but that data can't be compressed without hurting the local node's behavior.

Personal experience with transactions, dozens of reported instances on the sub, over a decade of experience engineering distributed systems...
Think about it: any one node will remove a tx after 2 weeks, but if any other node got it later (say because it joined or rebooted while the tx was valid) that other node will repropagate the tx to everyone else. Rinse and repeat forever.
You can see it when a tx that has been unconfirmed for a long time says it's new on some block explorers but not others.
Edit: fix autocorrect

If you don't CPFP, it'll be stuck until either 1) it gets dropped from the network (which I believe is unlikely) or 2) fees drop enough that it clears.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:28:49
If you sent it with RBF, you can bump the tx fee (your wallet would show that option if available) otherwise, either you or the recipient can CPFP it (you by re-spending the change output, or the recipient by spending the payment output. Note that CPFP is expensive because you have to pay enough total fee to bring the fee per byte of _the combined_ 1st and second transactions up to the current mining price.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:24:14
Tx timeout is broken due to emergent network behavior (tx gets rebroadcast is nodes join and leave, and the network shifts).
Edit: emergent not emergency.

Either side can use CPFP, the sender would doo it on the change output.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:23:57
I think the network is doing this to itself. Enough people seem to run nodes with different sized mempools that txs seem to age out and then reappear constantly, moving from large pool to large pool via small pools. I've seen a low fee tx of mine disappear from one explorer, while visible on another, then reappear, repeat, then I CPFPd it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:56:24
Check out Cold Ti
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:45:52
I don't see the contradiction: At some point in the future, the transaction will either settle to the state of evicted, or confirmed. Due to the emergent behavior of the global mempool, that point is not defined. Therefore, the transaction will be in the mempool indefinitely.
Again, if you (or the receiving party) are concerned, you can CPFP the unconfirmed transaction to pull it into a block sooner.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:12:19
Fee is unrelated to amount moved on the blockchain. Costs same to move one Satoshi as one Bitcoin.

You need an on chain tx to top up your channel, unless you barter for it with someone else in Lightning.
The latest work from the LN folks lets us top up with only one on chain tx, rather than the original theory which required closing and reopening using 2 txs.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:38:45
Yeah, that's basically what I meant, I don't think it requires a new node.
I think the right fix is for a future version of Bitcoin to introduce a reverse timelock so that you can tell the network not to confirm the tx after block x is mined. The uncertainty on when or if a tx will ever be fully flushed from the mempool is tough on users.

The difficulty of finding the block keeps the rate at about 1 per ten minutes. The protocol specification includes a periodic (about every 2 weeks) difficulty adjustment. The variability is because finding blocks is a probabilistic process (think guess and check a number between 1 and 1 trillion trillion trillion), so it depends how long it takes for someone to find a valid block hash.

The seller will want to count the cash before sending the tx. Make sure it stays visible until the tx is confirmed. Watch for slight of hand and such by the seller.
Depending on the value wait for 1 or more confirmations. (Under 1k USD, I'd trust 1, 10k 2, 100k... That's a lot of cash, 3.)

Not sure I understand the question, but most wallets let you either export a private key, or export a seed which is used to generate a key or keys.

You can split your Bitcoin between segwit and legacy addresses.

Bitcoin is still bring actively changed, this is somewhat like asking if the internet is old tech compared to cloud computing. Ripple and Ethereum have interesting properties, but nothing about them gives them an inherent ability to process more transactions faster than Bitcoin. They are faster now because they have done fewer transactions so far.
Most of the innovation on core blockchain tech happens in Bitcoin (and Litecoin and a few others to some degree) and then propagates to other cryptos, at the same time innovation in features on top of the core blockchain happens in other alts and sometimes migrates the other way. Bitcoin's smart contact abilities are growing gradually, for example.
Bitcoin gains features at a more sedate pace, but that's a good thing, just look at some of the huge bugs that Ethereum smart contacts have hit.

@_date: 2017-12-28 18:30:42
That depends on your wallet. Some wallets may not allow you to make additional transactions on unconfirmed outputs.
If your wallet let's use chain additional transactions, the later transactions cannot be confirmed until the earlier one is. (This all depending on the specifics of the utxos in your wallet and how it picks which one to send next)
Another alternative is that some wallets let you simply resend the original transaction with a higher fee, this is called rbf or replace by fee.
I'm short it's complicated, and I don't personally know what ledger can do. Maybe try asking in @_date: 2017-12-14 01:13:08
I'll do my best:
Right now, typical transaction fees for a reasonable confirmation time are `&gt; 200` Satoshis/byte.  A Satoshi is `1/100,000,000` BTC, and a typical transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs is about `250` bytes, so a fee for a typical transaction is `250*200=50,000` Satoshis.  As I type, Bitcoin is trading at about `$16,500`/BTC, so `50,000/100,000,000*$16,500=$8.25` per transaction.
Because of the way that Bitcoin transactions are constructed, adding more source transactions adds more bytes to the transaction, meaning that right now anything in your wallet that was sent in batches less than about $8.25 is unspendable.
The chart that I linked is one possible way to monitor current network transaction fees.  Using it, you can deduce that there have been times in the past week where transactions between 50 and 70 Satoshi/byte were clearing, that's 4x lower than current fees, and would enable you to lose only about $2 per input transaction int he process of moving your Bitcoin.
Transactions originating from SegWit addresses cost about 1/2 as many bytes as those originating from `legacy` addresses.  Based on what you're saying, I'm assuming that your current wallet is not using SegWit addresses.
* So, first thing you should do is download a wallet that supports SegWit, this is the hard part, because many do not yet support it. Don't use GreenAddress for this (even though their wallet is excellent and supports SegWit) because it uses multisig, which also increases tx costs. A quick glance at the internet tells me that Armory might be a good option, but I haven't used it, so can't personally vouch.
* If your current wallet doesn't support custom fees, export its private key, and import it into one that does.
* Set a custom fee of between 50 and 70 Satoshis/byte, and send all of your coin to a new SegWit address. It might take a week or more to get there, but it will either get there or revert, and if it reverts, you can try again with a slightly higher fee in a few weeks. You'll lose probably $6-7 total, but your coin will consolidated, and _most_ of the value will be spendable.

I think that's fine, so long as you aren't performing the service of trading Bitcoin between buyers and sellers.  It's a fine line based on my understanding.  Are you buying and selling personal property like an eBay seller or are you performing the service of transmitting and transforming money for others like Western Union?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:14:49
To respond more directly to OP's point:
If you are _not_ using one of the above mentioned exchanges and buy _and_ sell digital currency (or any other currency alternative, such as gift cards) you are required to have a money transmitter's license (or something like that) to do so.
If you are just buying digital currency the way you would buy apples, or paperclips then you are fine.
Similarly, if you are just selling your digital currency the way that you would sell a set of golf clubs, or some old clothes, you're fine.
So, IIUC, buying Bitcoin to HODL or to spend is fine, spending Bitcoin is fine, selling bitcoin after you've HODL'd it for a while is fine... it's buying and selling as a way of profiting on the trading that's not fine.
IANAL, but this is what I've been able to surmise.

Downvote for idiocy.  "Who will decide" THE MARKET WILL DECIDE!  Who's deciding to start using bitcoin?  It's not some central authority, it's not the bitcoin.org folks, it's the MARKET.  Idiot.  I hate drivel like this.

Uhm, what US money supply are you talking about?!
The current US money supply (just the base money supply, not M2 or M3 or even the monetary base) is just shy of 2 trillion today.  That's 2x10^12, add in cents and you have 2x10^14.  21 million bitcoins is 2.1x10^7, add in 8 decimal places and you have 2.1x10^15.  Thusly you have 10.5x the number of cents in the current US M1.  That's not a margin that I'm comfortable with.  M2 stands at almost 9 trillion and M3 is a little over 14 trillion, bringing the ratio down to almost 1:1, which is important given that BTC cannot be created out of thin air the way that USD can be.  (the BTC:YenM1 ratio is about 4 and the BTC:YenM3 ratio is about 2, the comparison to gold is a bit more favorable with 210k BTC/oz, but an ounce of gold buys a lot of other goods, so even gold has a bit of a practical divisibility problem in the modern world) BTC simply does not support its own success, in the long run, it'll be a system with an ever shrinking supply of currency and not enough of it.
Not to mention the other scaling problems like the ever growing block chain.
Listen, I'm not saying that I don't love the project, all I'm saying is that whomever designed it with this kind of limited scalability didn't consider realistic requirements to power a major currency.  You don't design a system to have just as much exchange divisibility as the existing system, you design it to have a few hundred times more.

In this case, it's not that we need to shift the decimal place, it's that we need more fundamental units of value.  As the products created by humans become more numerous and range more widely in value, a currency must be able to represent both the most costly and least costly item in the economy AND represent all of the items in the economy.  Shifting the decimal place would mean that you (potentially) could never buy a single candy bar for BTC, only a package of 10 would be available at the cost of a single basic unit of value.
I know, of course, that this is a solvable problem, but it's better to solve it now while the number of clients in the wild is small than in 10 years when it becomes a Y2Kesque scramble as the value of 10^-8 BTC starts to exceed the practical spending needs of some folks.  Especially because it's comparatively _EASY_ to solve since bitcoin is purely digital.

Switched to bitcoins.lc already :)  Not that I'm of any consequence.

For 2, the fee goes to whomever calculates the block which first confirms the transaction.  It's meant to encourage people to generate blocks even if they have little hope of mining a whole 50 coins.
1 is one of my big questions, so I hope you get a good answer.

Agreed on most points, but I'm willing to accept that the existing block chain could be imported into a new protocol when the time comes and such a new protocol is created.  Currencies have rolled over many times in the past.

8 decimal places is not very many.  The current bitcoin economy is already worth $50mil US -- if only 1 BTC remained, that would be 100million units of value representing 5 billion units of value.
Bitcoin people keep talking about 8 decimal places as though it's a lot.  It's not.  It's not enough.  They need to be infinitely divisible and someone needs to fix that, NOW.  Before it gets too big.

Upboated for the comments discussion on the original article.

Upboat.  Reading your comment made the paper more clear.
