Rizun is a troll and has basic facts wrong. unlimited blocks fails.

nice handle u/EndlesslyManipulable
maybe you were too busy trolling but the developers spoke and are working on soft fork 2mb size increase via segregated witness and to the roadmap 
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:42:43
the original 101 was in 2 year steps, 20mb then 40mb then...  when people pointed out flaws reacted to change the BIP to what you saw later.
the flaws were arithmetic error in his tests so gavin had actually really tested 10mb not 20mb guess he didnt count the block relay, so he changed it to 8MB.  and other flaw people said double previous size at each step was bad in creating a fee change event so he made it more frequent and smaller steps.
the third and much bigger flaw was Gavin didnt test it on a real network did it on localhost or lan or by estimating.
when tested 101 on real networks he concluded 3-4MB was max safe with todays network.  this real data that the miners have been saying for a long time is why now people are focusing on network data validated proposals like segregated witness, and 2mb or 248 or what said below.

good point. original poster claimed those arguing for 2mb blocks were unfairly claiming those arguing for 8mb blocks were unable to defend their position logically: onus is on those arguing for 8mb-8gb blocks to give a counterargument to your point that western miners lose and bitcoin risks falling subject to chinese government control.

thank you for clarifying and for doing the tests and bringing some empirical rigor. it is helpful and i wish more people even prominent bitcoin people would use facts and data.
what was your metric for safe? a maximum acceptable orphan rate?
it maybe a risk to rely on the relay network because it only compresses by node cooperation. the relay network in current configuration is under matt corallo's central control. your decision to  test without relay network to determine safety is correct I think.
if 9mb blocks have 20s propagation how high do you expect orphan rates? maybe same question as above how does safety of 9mb in west compare to safety of 3-4mb in china?
I worry that if chinese miners have 60% then like u/petertodd said  bigger blocks mean western miners will need chinese nodes and so risk bitcoin falling under chinese government control.

the dialogue is about timing. some want to increase the network scale first and others want to do tested size increases first that miners support, then improve the network protocols and bandwidth, then increase size more.. the latter is less controversial and more likely to happen as a compromise between todays network performance and tomorrows visions of payment processors.

thank you for a thoughtful reply.
you said that chinese miners will have to adapt. but if chinese miners are disadvantaged they will just spv mine and it will be the western miners that lose. recall chinese miners have over 60% means that the bad network in china is the western miners problem it is westerners that will lose money. also chinese miners are mostly spv mining already so we do not have to speculate. 
you said there are many users and companies outside china. note that bitcoin is big in china and population of china is &gt; 1 billion. there is much bitcoin economic activity in china.
all would like to scale as far and as early as possible but the network is not ready for it yet.  once it is ready we should expect and ask core to increase size.
it is not just chinese miners saying this. bitfury says it and they are in europe. toomim says it and he is in usa.  the data of the real network says do 2-4mb now and fix the network then do more.

maybe. the miners have been saying 8mb to 8gb is too much for a long time. but as too fast size increase hurts miners on orphan rate and so profit and miners have ability to soft fork size reduction they might do it in  self interest. but it does make bitcoin weaker to selfish mining attack because once it happens they can remove the soft fork limit and go to the max and keep control. only way to get it back is an organised user and business hard fork.

the other weird question is why anyone semi-competent would want to tarnish the reputation by working for the premining scammers.
word from leaked decks is ripple are also bad mouthing bitcoin behind closed doors to banks, regulators and anyone that will listen with more ripple fud.  like bitcoin is illegal blah blah.
stellar where to start.  another day another premine.
stellar isnt even compatible with ripple even though its a fork!
and all the pump story on stellar about financial inclusiveness, they are a combination of scammers and delusional front-men who know nothing about the scam history.
like all alt coins they are desperately claiming famous names as advisers more important than features or use case.  reputation and marketing is everything.  most of the names have no idea they signed themselves up for a pyramid pump and dump scam, fooled by the reputation collection game and the charitable cover story of financial inclusion.

more ripple misleading.  the first round was a party round so a16z barely invested anything.  of course ripple likes to talk about Andreesen Horowitz and they cant very well yell at them because they did technically invest, but it was peanuts % of the early round, not a strategic investment or an actual I believe in this bet.

He doesnt need a citation he's u/mike_hearn ! Mike is a walking logical fallacy catalog generator  you can usually get a ratio of 1 fallacy per sentence or more from his stuff.
That one is argumentum ex culo - ie he made it up and its a lie.
