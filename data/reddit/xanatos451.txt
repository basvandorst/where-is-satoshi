No, the entire system itself is circular. The other poster is correct in his description of what money itself is. Money itself has no intrisic value, it's a stand-in for things of value it is exchanged for (i.e. goods and services). 
Money was created because bartering goods and services was inefficient and difficult to keep track of. How do you value someone's skilled labor for 2 hours against someone's unskilled labor of 4 hours? How do you pay someone to dig a well with wheat you grew when they didn't need the wheat themselves? How do you keep up with appropriate rates of exchange when one good is plentiful and another is more rare? You can do this in a ledger, but it quickly becomes cumbersome to keep up with and difficult to divide those valuable goods and services at a fair and predictable rate.
That's where money comes in and was created as a distributed ledger system for units of value. Now, this shiny piece of metal that is hard to find (making it hard to counterfeit, especially when minted into specific shapes), is somewhat easy to create set units of trade in (denominations) and is easy to distribute over a large trade area. There have been all sorts of currencies, both paper and coin but their purposes we're always the same. Even peppercorns were used for a period of time because of their value and ease of transaction, but that starts to muddle the line between currency and bartering for a good (similar issue with precious metals but different and I'll explain shortly).
Money/currencies thus became the medium of exchange (the middleman) for all goods and services and its form has been largely physical in one way or another, but not always, especially when banks and lenders are involved. That's where the previous use of ledgers still play a role, but now instead of keeping track of how many bales of hay or hours of digging you owe for the 5 quarts of milk you bought, they simply keep track of the popular currency amounts instead since it became the common way to judge value.
So now that you have a trustworthy unit of exchange that can be easily transfered from one person to another, now you can sell your goods and services to anyone (not just to those who had something you needed) and thus compete in a market against like goods and services. This is more efficient and cost effective for everyone. 
People confuse money with things having intrisic value. Money itself has no intrisic value, unlike good and services. Goods and services still have their value without money but money has no value without goods and services. It starts getting murky when you start using things like precious metals and such because those have been used as a unit of currency but themselves are a good which can be traded for other use besides as a means of transaction. As such, gold/silver/precious stones are really a commodity more than anything else. They can have both an intrisic value and be used as a means of exchange, though technically anything can be used as an exchange medium really.
Over time, we developed markets and financial systems that have so complicated everything, the average person no longer thinks of things having value except what it is tied to in a unit of currency. It's kind of ironic really. We created money to simplify the means of trade and ensure the value of goods and services were appropriately traded and ended up with a system with so many middlemen, that money became the object people perceive as value and not the end goods and services it was created to facilitate the transaction of. 
Where you seem to be getting hung up on is the concept of IOUs vs a promissory note (i.e. I promise to pay you money). A promissory note would be an IOU for a loan of currency, not for a direct good/service. What he's referring to as an IOU is what the medium of exchange is. Think of it as money being receipts that everyone transacts in. 
For example: I have a bale of hay but need some nails for my barn only the Blacksmith doesn't need hay and doesn't  want to have to deal with a bale of hay to exchange it for something he needs. Because a bale of hay is difficult to transport, I give a receipt for a bale of hay to the blacksmith. The blacksmith now possesses the IOU receipt of a bale of hay which they can trade to the butcher for a chicken and so on until someone trades for the IOU of a bale of hay that actually needs it and collects. As mentioned, this is inefficient and also easily subject to counterfeit. The goods exchanged throughout the transaction cycle we're the only things of intrinsic value, not the IOU receipt.
Now, if you were to start talking about promissory note and lending of currency, that gets into the rabbit hole a bit further but it's really nothing more than individuals or institutions that act as a trustworthy middle man to increase market liquidity by using their own surplus as a buffer. They themselves are providing a service and charge for that service in the form of interests. Honestly you could talk for quite awhile getting into the banking system as a whole but it all boils down to that really.
Public ledgers are really no different than the private ledgers that a bank might use internally. Most USD does not exist in physical form as the vast majority is really all electronic ledger entries in various private institutions. You also have to remember that because lenders can loan money to others that isn't theirs, they are essentially creating additional money in the system based on how much they leverage their account holdings (see fractional reserve banking). This is why regulated money markets and finance laws are important because a run on banks could be catastrophic to an economy, but that's a whole other conversation.
TL;DR - Money is a system (electronic, physical, ledgered, etc) of unitizing goods and services in a common rate of exchange so as to facilitate transactions with any party in that system. That unit of exchange is itself paid and accepted because of trust in the system of the stability in the unit of value. That trust can be government, private (banks) or a public ledger (crypto). Those units themselves have no value except for the goods and services they are built upon, hence IOUs.

That does highlight a concern about the long term use of Bitcoin with a static cap and irretrievable funds. Sure, it is divisible by 8 decimals, but if a significant amount is stored on chain in the future, will that continue to be enough? I expect there will be better management of addresses and using multi-keys as a safety measures to help mitigate the problem though as the value and use increases.

That makes no sense whatsoever. Exchanges aren't illegal so there is no law that would defend the actions of stealing deposits from new traders. This all went on for a couple of months after withdrawals were shut down. They kept allowing deposits into accounts meaning they were effectively stolen from the depositors. If it was just a gag order, those funds should have been refunded as they would still have them. Also, what purpose would continuing to allow deposits but not withdrawals of any kind serve other than to simply steal the money deposited.

Except that once you leave the actual bitcoin space, you're no longer dealing in that currency but in another representative currency. This is doable in fiat but not in a fixed asset market. This would be the same as trying to do it in another (relatively) fixed asset such as gold, your example doesn't work with bitcoin because you cannot arbitrarily say there are more Bitcoins than are possible in the entire network.
Edit: To clarify a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin just like an once of gold is an once of gold. A USD was once a fractional representation of an amount of gold/silver but it still never changed the actual amount of ounces of gold that existed. Now someone could come along and make a Bitcoin Note that would be representative of an amount of Bitcoin (or fractions therein) but at that point, you are no longer dealing in Bitcoin but an arbitrary promise note that is representative of an asset. I.E. USD is not Gold and a fractional reserve equivalent of Bitcoin is not Bitcoin.

It's all about perception. People look at the downturn as negative when in actuality, there's money to be made there. Simply buying and holding, hoping for the value to go up is a long term proposal which I'm sure will happen, eventually. In the meantime, volatility breeds opportunity to short/long sell and make money there as well, thus increasing interest in profitability. Unfortunately it's a bit of a gamble. You win some, you lose some. But if you hedge your bets right, you can take some of the risk out of it as long as you don't get greedy.

I understand what your talking about and I have. That still doesn't change the fact that there's a difference in perceived value of holdings and actual monetary supply. Unlike dollars, there is no physical equivalent and Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. You can represent dollars electronically and physically. Bitcoins only exist in a digital realm and are finite. 
I get your argument but it has nothing to do with the fact that there cannot be more than x amount of a finite, deflationary currency. You can trade in ever smaller fractions that represent a higher store of value, but this is not the same thing.

The problem is that the media and the general populace need to stop thinking that every exchange that gets hacked has anything to do with security with Bitcoin itself. Every time I discuss Bitcoin security with a layman or hear about a failed exchange on the news, it always seems to be viewed as there being some flaw with Bitcoin which of course we all know is not true. Those are simply failings of security at individual exchanges, much like a single bank robbery doesn't mean about the security of the banking system.
TL;DR - Laymen seem to think that Bitcoin has security flaws because of media misreporting.

I seriously doubt that would happen without some ability to credit existing holders with the same value in extra bitcoin. When you increase the number of stocks in an offering, existing holders have their shares increased that many fold because the value of each is now worth less. 
The only way I could see a change to the incremental nature of bitcoin would be to increase the number of decimal places. There would still only be 21 million bitcoins, but you could break them apart in smaller increments. As there are already 8 decimal places, I doubt there will be a need to ever do this.

Completely agree as this is what I've been saying since the whole thing went down. I think Gox was simply a failed fractional reserve system that was leveraged way beyond its means and mismanaged along the whole way. Karpeles got greedy and used customer deposits/coins to pay for lawsuits and other expenses instead of honoring the investments and when the price skyrocketed he kept putting off the inevitable until it was far too late to do anything about it.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:57:15
That was in 2011 I think. Just because he had control of that many then, doesn't mean he didn't sell some as the price was rising for cash. More than 2.5 years is a long time for him to lose that and more. The whole point is that he was being greedy thinking that as long as the market fluctuates in wild swings, he can sell high and buy low so long as he maintains enough holdings to cover withdrawals. It's the same thing that happens over and over again with banks. How may times has that burned depositors in the past when a bank plays fast and loose with it's customer's funds? That's the very definition of what can happen in a fractional reserve scenario. It's part of the reason why banks have to have FDIC insurance of customer's accounts.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:43:45
He also paid a massive sum of coins to another company since then. There is no evidence that he ever replaced them. It is completely irrelevant to the current issue as we already know that was not the only wallet that Gox used.

The sad fact is that without the actual transaction logs from the exchange, it wouldn't be traceable from the block chain as it occurred outside of it. It's not a new scenario either.

I don't think they necessarily ever had them. I have a feeling that a lot of coins were purchased that were never actually funded as the company was hedging on the prices to crash again so they could make large profits on the difference. The problem is that once they started, the hole got deeper and deeper until panic buys when they got to a certain point after which the bubble burst and they were now stuck with too few coins with the price falling. Rinse, repeat. 
I think it simply boils down to bad management gambling with other people's money and too much dipping into customer funds for personal and corporate expenses.

Sad to say, but I don't think they exist.

My guess is that through a series of bad judgement calls, he expected Bitcoin to crash back to previously lower levels so that he could buy them for significantly less than he sold them for, pocketing the difference. When the ceiling skyrocketed, he likely panic bought with customer funds but at that point it simply spiraled out of control because he was already too deep in the hole to continue honoring withdrawal requests, to which the delays and freezes on withdrawals were encountered.
It makes sense and it is an extremely simple explanation to what happened. It seems much more likely, to me at least, that this is what happened over some mysterious undetectable hack or a claimed "break-in" in which such a volume of both currency and Bitcoin could be taken without proof of where or when it happened.

You would when the merchants are able to offer better prices to customers once this fee disappears. Currently, major retailers aren't allowed to charge for the fees (per a required agreement with the processor) that accepting credit/debit cards cost them in a transaction vs cash so they mark everything up accordingly as an expectation of the cost of doing business. Smaller business will sometimes offer a cash discount or charge extra for using something like AmEx (which costs them more to accept) if they think they can do so without getting in trouble with the processing company.

At this point I can't tell if you're a troll or just dense. You're resorting to strawman arguments now which leads me to believe you have no interest in an honest conversation about the technology.
On the point of moving to Bitcoin as THE global currency, I actually don't see that as a bad thing. Currency manipulation is a problem in the current scheme. It hides economic issues instead of addressing them. It allows those who control the monetary policy to take advantage of the system and pass on the expense of poor fiscal and foreign policies onto its citizens with little to no recourse. 
The idea that only an endebted society is a successful one is insanity and eventually it will lead to an inevitable collapse. The current financial systems are very irresponsible and long overdue for a change. I'm not disillusioned that Bitcoin will solve all of these woes, but I do think it will help usher in the idea of a more open financial system that is more stable for everyone in the long run by opening up these systems for scrutiny.

AV on a phone is simply because some people will buy it thinking they need it, it's completely unnecessary. I have yet to see anyone on an iPhone or otherwise who will say their phone "feels" as fast as it did the day they bought it. Our perception over time changes. Honestly, I had the same complaint about my iPhone when I had it. That thing ran like crap. I was so beyond ready for a new phone by the time my contract expired. 
I've never cared for the idea of placing icons all over the screen the way the iPhone is setup. To me it's like dumping all of your programs on your desktop. Sure, you can consolidate them into folders, but they're still on the screen. The way Android puts things into a drawer (which is also customizable) and leaves your main screen(s) for widgets and just the things you use most often, is a much better approach in my opinion. On top of that, throw in the ability to completely change the entire interface to one of your preference, and it really makes it a much more personal experience. There's nothing even close in the iPhone to some of the add on functionality you can do on an Android.
Everyone has their preferences and opinions, but I don't think anyone can argue against the statement that Android is a very open ecosystem while Apple is very closed.

Keep in mind that some of us sold not in a panic, but in expectation that the price would continue a decline so that we could then repurchase at a lower rate and increase our holdings and many others are simply short selling. It's just the name of the game and most people realize this. No need to harp on about "panic selling" as that's not necessarily the case.

Then you have no understanding how the Bitcoin protocol works. There can only be 21M whole coins in the blockchain as the protocol's current implementation stands. 
If an exchange/bank/etc. wants to say they have 40M Bitcoins in their reserves, they may have that perception of solvency by holding other investments or currency that total to the equivalent value of 40M Bitcoin, but there is no possible way that they can actually have 40M Bitcoins, period.
That said, I believe a smaller division (say milibitcoins or what have you) may eventually become the standard by which values are exchanged, with the exception of large sums of money where full Bitcoins make more sense.

No, you misunderstand what I was saying. I was referring only to coins purchased via Gox. People also sent their Bitcoins to their account on Gox to then sell. I'm sure that many of them were in fact exchanged for fiat at that point, but it is also likely that they started holding onto them when they saw the price rising, it is also likely that coins were held in an attempt to sell them later for more money, thus further adding to the financial deficit they were digging with lack of purchasing coins for agreed prices when agreed.
It has been shown that there were bots on the exchange that drove prices up and down artificially which I think further goes to prove my point. It seems to me that no matter how you slice it, there was poor management of the exchange and it was used in an attempt to game the system to make money off of they high volitility of the currency. Unfortunately like a gambler on a losing streak, they just kept getting deeper in debt trying to double down against their loses.

No, it is not a main form of currency on Almost Human.

It was also mentioned in a scene on The Blacklist where it was again used as a step to route money in a way to make it "untraceable" for nefarious purposes.
The big problem here that is readily apparent is that Hollywood seems to be running with the idea that Bitcoin is a completely anonymous/untraceable form of currency that is used for illegal goods/services.

You're also duplicating many things in a modular design that would normally be shared. This leads to a much more inefficient design and more power consumption. SOCs are extremely efficient and compact because they share a lot of resources. There's so many arguments about why this will never be a consumer level device, I just don't have the time to list them out on my phone. This would be a great developer tool for someone designing a phone, but there are just too many cons over device integration that will prevent it from succeeding. My only hope is that it will force the discussion of more easily repairable designs to extend the life of device in the event of component breakage.

Guess what, cash comes with its own costs and is still in the realm of dealing with the money changers. You'd be naive to think that cash is free to use.

Modularization is nice in theory, but what you have to understand is that it makes many sacrifices to achieve this. In something like a phone, space is a premium on top of the rugged requirements necessary for reliability in day to day use. Modular phones have been tried plenty of times and have failed miserably. 
When you modularize a design, you introduce all sorts of new complexities as well as compromise the integrety of interconnection between components. On top of that, you severely limit your platform overall by attempting to keep the number of interconnecting pathways to a minimum. A modular frame would only be good for roughly as long as your typical phone platform is today. As soon as you upgrade platforms, it is likely that few, if any of the modular components would be compatible with the new one. We already see this in the PC platform. You won't be cutting down on electronic waste. If anything, you'll probably be adding to it. 
No matter how you try to slice it, modular phones will always be bulkier, more inefficient, more prone to failure and compatibility issues and more costly than their integrated counterparts. If we were talking about something that was not a mobile device, this wouldn't be such an issue (modular PCs), but we're not and you can't draw the same parallels here. It's a cool experiment and will be useful for those who want to play with the technology, but they will never be a product that is reliable, inexpensive and efficient enough for the mass consumer. 
The real issue that should be pushed is the design for more easily serviceable phones. Screen replacements are the most common cause for people to prematurely discard a phone. Most phones can be fixed but some designs make this unnecessarily harder to do with each generation.

I disagree. Simply hoarding Bitcoin instead of spending it on goods and services will only serve to make Bitcoin an investment commodity. The goal is to increase the ubiquity of it, not just the price. As more people start using Bitcoin, the price will inevitably rise.

That would be assuming that Mark wasn't using customer funds all along. I think that the reason for all of the missing funds (Bitcoin and cash) is due to a failed fractional reserve system Mark was using in an attempt to short purchases so he could make massive profits whenever  price bubbles burst. The problem is that the market grew exponentially and he wasn't prepared for it. He's always played it fast and loose with customer funds so why should this be any different.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:32:20
People with bank accounts and credit cards very rarely use physical cash though in today's society. The concept of digital payments is not as hard to grasp as many make it out to be. Granted, the back end and the denominations are a little confusing to the layman, but most get over it quickly and treat it similarly to doing business in a foreign currency where they simply use an exchange rate to gauge value. 
The concept of mining and how the block chain works is not something most people need to understand in order to use Bitcoin. Most people have no idea how the internal combustion engine works, but they all drive cars. Every day it's getting easier to use and obtain Bitcoin without any special knowledge. Just like with any technology, it has to mature before mass adoption takes place. Innovation and mass exposure will do this for Bitcoin.

I agree and I work at NCR. The best thing to do is simply appeal to the merchants themselves to request the feature as that's how it typically works. Some of us NCR guys also browse Reddit as well and even a few in my department are also Bitcoiners so it's not like we're not trying to push for it internally. 
But anyway, you're pretty much spot on that going about it directly to a company like NCR is not the best approach. Since NCR deals with multi-million dollar contracts for most of its POS licensing sales to merchants, if a customer lists it as a must have feature, then that's when it will be added to the release roadmap.

Just FYI, I work at NCR in the retail POS platform development groups. Several of my colleagues and I have been into the Bitcoin scene for at least the last year or so and I had a couple of ideas I submitted late last year that corporate has shown interest in but there is no active development to integrate into our platform at this time. I've been told the attitude is still "wait and see" as to how much interest there is from our customers. 
I'm only speaking as to what is going on with the retail POS application in my group with certainty, but as far as I am aware, none of the other POS groups (self checkout, silver, etc) are actively integrating yet either at this time. There's awareness of it but until our customers start demanding the feature, I doubt it will make it into active development.

Likely because he dug a hole for himself via fractional reserves, pocketing the profits. Then the ceiling burst to 1200 which probably resulted in him trying to buy at +1000 per coin when he realized that he wasn't going to be able to meet withdrawal demands due to the now upside down ratio of the account balances to actual holdings. 
Basically, he sold coins he didn't actually own when the price was low without ever buying the coins to cover the account balances, figuring he could pocket the difference when the price eventually crashed again by buying later. Only problem with this is the sudden skyrocketing value of coins resulting in account balances he'd never be able to cover. Eventually he probably figured he should start buying as the cost is climbing exponentially and he there are more demands on account withdrawals than he holds. Then when the runs on accounts started and the price started falling, Gox coins were being sold below market price in an attempt to fund wallets and hoping that this would continue to crash the value so the full account balances could be covered. 
This would certainly fit with the missing cash and coins in a simple and likely scenario. He made bad decisions in using fractional reserves to try and make money which spiraled out of control. Simply put, he was greedy and placed bad bets with other people's money.

Then why won't he release the wallet addresses to the community? We're not talking about a few hundred coins here. The volume of that many would be trackable. If these coins have truly been taken, then letting the world see the evidence would help alleviate suspicion. With the lack of communication in the face of such accusations of fraud, it just seems more likely that this is a cover up. It is more likely that he has either lost access to the wallet(s), has been issued a gag order as the government seized control of the funds, or he has simply committed massive fraud. 
It seems much more likely that do to mismanagement of funds early on, the coins were never purchased and the company became deeper in debt when the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed beyond his expectations. I'd be willing to bet that most, if not all of this is due to mismanagement of a fractional reserve scheme in an attempt to make profits which backfired severely. As things spiraled out of control, I can also see this happening on both sides of the volatility, panic buying by Karpeles as the price soared above 1000 per coin, then panic selling as it dropped. 
When faced with the likelihood of different scenarios, Occam's Razor comes into play. Which is more likely, fraud/mismanagement or a super skilled hacker spy that can sneak away funds of that magnitudes without drawing any attention?

Except most of the time the fee is way more than the overdraft amount. I've literally had over $100 in fees before due to being overdrawn by less than $.30 (yes that's 30 cents). They organize the way withdrawals are processed from accounts in order to generate the most fees possible. 
Instead of processing them in the order they're made, they do them a day at a time organized highest to lowest. So instead of some reasonable charge for being slightly in error on an account, they can then deduct fees from your account ensuring that other charges which had sufficient funds are now overdrawn and further stack overdraft fees. It's a racket and they make a lot of money by doing it this way.

No, I just understand that if we're ever to be taken seriously as anything more than a commodity, we're going to need the ecosystem to mature and continuous merchant adoption. That is only going to happen when people actually buy goods and services with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes more mature, merchants will convert less to fiat as they'll be able to pay vendors and their own bills via Bitcoin as well, it's reciprocal.

Bitcoin is a specific implementation and is not all inclusive of other coins.
Can additional currencies be counted as a total number of cryotocurrencies? Sure. Can the bitcoin protocol be rewritten to increase the ceiling to the total number of bitcoins? I suppose. Regardless, this does not change that the original argument is currently false. Just because it is false today doesn't mean it couldn't be true in the future, but at the same time being that the future is unknown, doesn't change the validity of the statement being currently false.

Exactamundo. At this point, retailers already have a miriad of ways to conveniently and securely accept payment. The only thing I see that will be of interest to retailers in adopting another form of payment is one that does one or more of four things: decrease transaction times, increase profit by lowering costs, increase security/decrease fraud, increase patronage. Bitcoin is currently doing three of the four and I can only see ApplePay doing one at best (decrease transaction time), and even then, only marginally so.

I highly doubt that. Until it is a non-platform specific system, there will be too much chaos for retailers to want to integrate a system that will cost them millions to implement. Also, keep in mind that retailers don't roll out solutions to production overnight. Some of the larger companies with hundreds or thousands of stores (and countless terminals) will likely take 6 months to a year before they roll anything out due to the integration and testing they must perform on their systems and the logistics of training and what not. Let's also not forget that ApplePay is taking an additional cost per transaction from retailers which they would have to be convinced into swallowing. Honestly, I see something like Bitcoin payments through NFC taking off sooner than a platform specific payment service that takes a cut of sales.

When increase wasn't realized and the windows on those leverages expired, there was a precipitous drop to mitigate losses. This also increased the number of investors who started shorting Bitcoin in order to make money due to the expected drop. Then you also have the strength of the dollar increase recently and several other investment factors at play. Volatility breeds investment opportunities which are being taken advantage of.
Do some homework before you make baseless assumptions. Though there are people spending Bitcoin which is then converted back to fiat, it's only a small fraction of what is actually happening with the price of Bitcoin. If anything, we need more people to spend Bitcoin as possible as merchant adoption rates will pressure industry adoption. Money talks and unless a majority of merchants and vendors start using/accepting Bitcoin, it will continue to be at the whims of investors looking to make a buck by manipulating the market.

It is currently a technical limit because the protocol has a currently set ceiling. You're trying to argue about a change which does not exist. That's apples and oranges. In the bitcoin protocol, there is a technical, hard limit to the number of bitcoins. Increasing the limit would be a rewrite of the protocol and is not comparable for the current argument. Socially, I don't see this ever happening because there is not a need for it to change due to the forethought of including an extremely high divisible nature into the protocol from inception. 
Quit trying to justify the argument of no limits by saying they can change the protocol because that's about as honest as saying you can run indefinitely in an electric car without prefacing that this requires charging and maintenance to be true.

You do realize that the majority of those transactions were not in people using Bitcoin but in buying, hoping that the next surge is about to happen or selling if they think the price is about to go down, right? Actual spending transactions have been increasing fairly consistently but the transaction spikes around price increases have little to do with people spending and more about people making money off of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle.

Not even the same argument dude.
 There's a reason why mobile electronics have gotten smaller and lighter over the years. SOC designs and shared resources have made such devices extremely efficient and more compact. We've been moving away from modular portable electronics for years. I am all for making these devices more serviceable in changing out broken major components more easily, but you seriously need to understand the issue better. 
It's never been about not being able to modularize, it's everything about that the cons are not worth the pros. Even in the PC realm, everything is moving towards more and more integration for these very reasons. Cost and effeciency means being able to compact everything to a more minimal amount of materials. 
The Google concept will likely be relegated to that of a developer platform as the cost, size and fragility will be unattractive to the average consumer.

Correlation != Causation
The price rising simply means there's more capital in the system than before, but you also have to understand that the price remaining stable means that more people are still investing millions in Bitcoin daily anyway as it is currently inflationary with ~30k coins added to the network daily (obviously this will not happen forever with the 21M cap, but it will continue to be so for some time). The number of transactions increasing happens as the network becomes more mature and grows, not because the price is rising. As more investors come on board and more transactions stay in network (not cashed out to fiat), then the price will of course rise.

If anything, getting in on accepting Bitcoin early will help spread word for smaller business due to the exclusivity of accepting it at this early stage.

I get that but even with hardware controllers I've found there's a performance hit (these are typically in VM host boxes). This may get less when you get into more than 3 or 4 drives but I've never personally run one larger than that. Most R5 capable controllers I've ever run have only supported 4 drives anyway and they were expensive at that. I've also seen how quickly it is for a RAID 5 to go from perfectly fine to a nightmare when a drive goes out. The rebuild time is excessively slow and you don't even want to know how quickly anxiety sets in should another failure or hiccup happen during that vulnerable stage.
I used to like R5 but since drive costs have dropped and high storage capacities were introduced, I switched to R10 arrays and have never been happier.

You're forgetting the likelihood that the customer funds were used before they were ever worth hundreds of millions.

You have to understand though that specialized processors are different from general CPUs, they're apples and oranges really.

Of course I think that's not necessarily a bad thing as the abuse of such power results in some of the issues we're seeing today, as well as hidden taxes in currency devaluation which enables the banks and the government to take advantage of new money when inflating the currency for profit/wars/etc.

The takeaway to keep in the back of your mind is that what makes Bitcoin special is the distributed ledger. If you create larger chunks of data (that take longer to transfer) or if you decrease the amount of time to allow the blocks to propagate, then you don't have much of a distributed ledger and the larger amount of hash power that is more closely located (and can properly distribute their blocks) then controls the network. Hence the argument that making changes to either of these two factors works against it's very purpose. It's all about trade offs.

In layman's terms, he bet the price was going to crash so he didn't actually buy coins that he sold on the exchange as the price rose. When it grew exponentially over a series of months without signs of stopping, he panic bought coins at a much higher cost than he sold them for. As this could not be sustained, withdrawal delays and holds became an issue until the inevitable happened. He gambled by creating a fractional reserve that he couldn't cover. It's evident that this is within the realm of possibility with the fact that Gox was selling coins way below market value towards the end. Though some of this could be account holders trying to get out. the more likely scenario was a last ditch effort to both crash the market and generate much needed cash so that they could try to dig themselves out by selling even more coins that didn't exist.

Imbezzlement is still theft. There's high likelihood he used customer funds/bitcoins to pay for expenses/settle lawsuits and got into an increasing deep hole as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed to the point they could never pay them back. The Gox coins existed off the block chain so in all likelihood, many of them never existed.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:24:21

If by thief you mean Karpeles. This sounds more and more like he created coins out of thin air having spent the original cash and coins for expenses early on. This has embezzlement of customer funds written all over it. I don't think the missing Gox coins were "stolen" per say, but rather the result of a failed fractional reserve where he was using customer funds illegally to which he found himself in a hole he could never fill after the price rose exponentially.

Considering that there is no Bitcoin entity (it's a collective), it's not like it can really be targeted to be sued and closed down. That's not to say businesses and exchanges can't be targeted but because it exists outside the jurisdiction of any single country or governing agency, it can't easily be shuttered.

You do realize that this isn't an issue unless you are simply including no or a very low fee. The bulk of the congestion is coming from low/no fee transactions in the form of spam. All transactions will eventually process as it dies down, but by having escalating fees, it becomes extremely more expensive to continue spamming the network.

In short, decentralization is the only thing that makes Bitcoin (like most blockchain tech that has followed) different and worth investing in for the future. The larger your blocks are or the shorter the time between blocks then you have less time for them to propagate and risk losing (becoming an orphan block) which means you lose out on the work you did for that block. Considering a significant portion of the mining power is behind the Chinese firewall which also further limits throughput, you then have to consider what this will do for increasing the number of orphan blocks generated.
This is why the point about centralization keeps being brought up because it's the longest chain that wins and forces other blocks to become orphaned. I used to be in the bigger block camp too until I started reading up about the challenges the network faces when you start increasing block sizes or decreasing time for verification because I never understood about the implications of orphaned blocks. Then, to top it off, once you start reading about the issues, you also start realizing how little this change would buy us. It's about weighing the pros and cons. The risks and rewards. Once I started understanding this, my opinion on the matter changed as I found the risk not to be worth the reward. That's why I keep saying it is important to do the due diligence and read up on decentralization, orphan blocks and block propagation.

Excellent points all around and exactly my understanding of the situation. I initially was in the bigger block camp until I started reading about the implications it had and that there was work underway to scale with a much better, well thought out solution. The problem is that there appears to be a lot of campaigning to non-technical folks who only care about the end result of transactions and fees now and not the long term health of the network. It's really frustrating because nobody is arguing that Bitcoin doesn't need to scale, but other camps are making it out like there is a conspiracy by core devs and that hard forking, what they seem to think is a harmless change, is what must be done now instead of letting the devs do the due diligence work we expect them to do and engineer the best solution instead of the easiest one.

Miners are motivated by fees. Any non-zero amount is the incentive to mine the transaction. Apparently you don't get how it works. It's the very basis of where the system is intended to go.

Is your credit card Visa? Credit card companies are bound by rules as well and Visa is approved for use because they deal with the credit card company directly. Who the Visa is issued from is secondary. I don't know the specifics but I would assume that it all has to do with chain of custody for the money. Because your bank has an agreement with Visa and Visa has an agreement with the exchanges, those are enough to satisfy the requirements regarding fincen regulations to prevent money laundering. Directly linking a bank account is seen as a lot riskier because of the potential to obfuscate the source of the money.
I could be wrong but that's how I understand it.

The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).
One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.
So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.
The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.
If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1
Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.
Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.
Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).
First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".
Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.
Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.
So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.

What? Dude, you really have no clue what the issue is do you? This is what bothers me about the whole debate, you're weighing in with your opinion about something you haven't done any homework on and don't seem to understand in the slightest. Please, do yourself and band very one a favor and educate yourself on the details. 
There is a susceptibility in the current code that allows large transactions to dramatically increase the time to verify. When you start increasing the block size, this problem becomes significantly worse.
This isn't about increasing the transaction sizes, it's about fixing an issue that is caused by large transactions. This is a known risk that must be mitigated before growing the block. So many people seem to keep thinking that increasoling the block size is a straightforward change with no risk. This is not true and exactly why the core devs are making significant strides before even considering making a change to the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:24:44
They are about technicalities because it's about prioritizing increasing the blocksize over necessary network and transaction layer improvements that really should be done first. When people argue about increasing the blocksize, they are typically only concerned about their transaction fees or time to confirmation vs being more forward thinking and being cautious about negatively impacting the network by making changes that will have bigger impacts than they realize. 
I'd rather leave these discussions up to the people with the technical chops that do understand these things and can make the decisions to appropriately implement them. The only thing my opinion should affect is whether I invest or not and if I choose to become more involved by running a full node or mining rig.

Based on what I've been reading, segwit sounds like a good place to start. Overall we need to look at efficiency before we start growing the transaction size. Everyone is chomping at the bit for this to be a production level product but we have to keep in mind that this is still very much an experimental technology. The quickest way to run the technology into the ground is to grow faster than we can be sure about how we should proceed. Bitcoin has gotten to where it is by making small, cautious steps. Trying to break into a sprint might cause us to stumble and fall, ultimately losing the race. Let's not forget the lesson of the tortoise and the hare.

Considering ELI5 explanations about this are posted all the time in response about this, either you aren't doing your due diligence to understand the issue, or you're simply ignoring valid concern because it conflicts with your opinion on the matter. These are technical issues that must be addressed. Going about it half-assed will do far more damage in the long term to Bitcoin's reputation than by being methodical and purposeful in our scaling plans. Take a lesson from the fable of The Tortoise and the Hare.

@_date: 2016-01-28 21:06:08
It's more about fixing issues that already exist in the protocol. Most people agree that at some point, the block size will need to grow some. The biggest problem is that there's a lot of network and transaction streamlining that has to happen first or a simple block size increase will cause additional problems. There's a good FAQ about what SegWit addresses that I recommend giving a once over.

That's just ridiculous. There will always be a cost. The difference is whether you see it or not. Typically the costs for exchanging money are built into the devaluation of the value that goes into it or an increase in the cost of goods. There will always be a cost involved in a payment system. Even things like gold and silver have a cost beyond just the initial mining and refining. The costs of transportation, storage and exchange is built into the system and is passed on to the end consumer. Bitcoin is simply transparent about the costs.

A fee market was always meant to take over. It's why the block reward halves continuously. Mining is not an altruistic endeavor. They expect to get paid for the resources they put up to process the network.
Also, it's better to cautiously take steps now than to rush ahead and make drastic, irreversible changes without fully understanding the consequences of our actions. If you think having some slightly higher fees now is an issue damaging Bitcoin's image, what do you think a problem arising from a contentious hard fork or the network having issues because of not fixing known issues like SegWit addresses first would do to it? Slow and steady wins the race. Learn from the lesson of The Tortoise and the Hare.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:25:20
As long as you make it nonzero, it will still get delivered. It just might take awhile before a spot in a block opens up that isn't occupied by higher fees. It used to be even at zero fees you could still count on it eventually being counted, but I believe that is no longer the case.

@_date: 2016-01-26 12:57:33
Exactly. Hence why there is resistance to changing what some people keep claiming as a low risk parameter. Hard forks come with plenty of risk on their own and we're also not sure what even a small size increase will do to the distribution of the network. We already see problems with some lack of decentralization due to large mining operations so the last thing we want to do is move the network further in that direction.
This realization is what changed my mind from wanting big blocks to trusting the core devs to come up with a better solution for the long term problem.
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:19:13
I probably would have sent something smaller if I was just testing the transfer. I think it will eventually be rejected by the network, I just don't know how long that is offhand.

As far as I understand it, SegWit works to take some of the unnecessary info out of the signature, thus lowering the size of the transaction. This is why wallets will also have to be updated to support it. Also, SW is a soft fork implementation vs a hard fork. I haven't read up enough about Lightning yet to speak about it intelligently, but as I understand it, the idea is to take a significant amount of the transactions off chain. What that actually implies, I don't know enough about yet but anything we can do to move transactions off the main chain of Bitcoin will help. 
There's also another proposal I just heard about called slim blocks which sounds very promising which I intend to read up on further. I'm not quite sure what the tradeoffs are yet but from my understanding, it would significantly cut down an existing 1mb block to something like 10-20kb. It's a lossy sort of compression from what I gather. Anything we can do to keep the block size low should be done as it ensures a better, faster distribution of information across the entire network.
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:28:53
Now is the best time. We need to fix scaling issues before we let the floodgates open that would bring the network to a halt or worse, break security. Bitcoin's real worth is being seen as an unassailable store of value.

No, you have a complete misunderstanding of the very basics of what makes Bitcoin secure. Your very first statement about the total hashing power makes that clear. Educate yourself about the fundamentals and you'll start to understand what the argument even is. That's why I'm not going to get into it with you.

Exactly. It's like junk mail. When you make profit the motivation for prioritization of delivery, the more important transactions will be grabbed first by the miners.

We speculate when we hear China implements currency controls or when Venezuela's inflation goes out of control even though it doesn't effect us in the US. Point is, the ETF is a major signal of legitimacy for major investment firms and people all over the world are speculating on the price in anticipation of it passing.

@_date: 2016-01-29 16:07:29
I think it really is more of a feedback loop based on the block usage. The closer blocks get to being full, the higher the pressure will be on wallets to upgrade to free up space in order to keep fees low. This is the reason why it's hard to estimate. As long as fees are reasonable and there's space in the block, wallets may not be updated because there is a lack of people pressing for the integration.

Not only are you devaluing the currency by increasing the supply at that point, I guarantee if you were to make a move like that (turning Bitcoin inflationary) you'd see a large exodus of people holding which would further devalue it. The miners would end up losing more in the long run by making such a move. The reason why Bitcoin is such a great store of value is also tied to it being a relatively fixed supply. Change any of these basic tenants and you will shake the very foundation on which the entire economy is built.

It was for a while, though it was somewhat in a slow downward slope from people getting out who were expecting a quick buck. That's not to say you can't make a lot of money quickly during a swing, but just like anything, it's easy to lose your shirt too if you invest more than you can afford to lose. The best thing to do is play it smart and invest for the long term (3-5 years) as it will be awhile before things get more predictable. Currently we're experiencing growing pains which is to be expected with any new, wildly successful venture. The recent downturn is due to weak hands being unsure about the future of it. At this point in the game though, I'm pretty confident that Bitcoin will continue to be around for a long time in one form or another based on the amount of participants and the investments going into it.

And in all fairness, this will still be possible. Someone can either decide to build their own layers on top of Bitcoin or still work directly with Bitcoin transactions, it will simply be less optimal than going through a different layer due to the complexity and speed of verification. Let's think of it like this. Sure, I could send an email directly to each person I want to by opening up a session to the destination email server of where the individual I want to email has their account, send HELO/EHLO and create my message manually, or I could simply use one of the many email services that relies on relays and DNS to properly route my message from my, much easier and more centralized mail system (Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.). It's not really all that different when you start thinking about Bitcoin as being the backbone of everything financial in the same way that email (more accurately SMTP) is simply a protocol on the internet for exchanging electronic messages.

Yeah, I agree. I tried timing back and forth to cash in the early days but that screwed me more than helped. Alt trading has paid off quite well though, even with my recent drop.

Because it's still a bank account that was hacked. Just because it was a bank account at the fed doesn't change that the comparison of stealing the funds vs altering how the funds are created or the rate at which it is introduced to the total supply. Someone didn't hack into the fed and create the amounts, they were already in the account and simply transferred out. This is no different than going into an exchange and emptying out the hot/cold wallets for the exchange. 
Maybe I was less than clear by simply stating "the FED" but what I was saying is that the money supply wasn't hacked. I thought this was clear by rtating USD afterwards. The FED I was referring to is the governing body at the central bank that determines how much money to supply and setting interest rates. This is why I keep saying you can't hack that unless you want to equate politics into hacking the FED, but that's an entirely different discussion altogether. 
My frustration is that you linked an article about money being stolen from the account which is not what the argument was about in the first place. If I was saying that banks couldn't be hacked like the FED, then it would be a relevant comparison. Differentiate between the FED policy makers and the central bank account. And code does change just as policy changes. The only difference is the governing body on Bitcoin code is much more democratic.

That's not a measure of success though. If you look at any investment on a short scale like that, you will see turmoil at some point in its history. That we've retained this much value after the meteoric and unrealistic rise we had last year is frankly impressive. It really hasn't been bad at all. 
Also, you have to look at the fact that nothing that only goes up in value will ever be anything more than a commodity. People make money on the downswings too and it adds supply to the market. We have to have periods of pullback which not only give some breathing room for devs and services to breathe, but to consolidate the next base for a rise.

The one thing I wish they would regulate about bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin business that hold their funds is to require them to fully disclose if they are a fractional reserve or not. Ideally requiring them to participate in regular, transparent audits so that depositors know where they stand if they decide to trust a business to hold their funds. This goes for cash deposits as well. I don't think that's asking for much. It's also not saying that a business can't operate as a fractional reserve, just that they have to disclose as such to their customers. It would certainly help build trust in how a company is handling customer deposits.
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:20:03
Quit defending the buffoon. The guy was pretty clearly using customer funds and got in over his head early on. He turned MtGox into a fractional reserve and through incompetence and his attempt to hide this fact, turned it into an utter shitstorm. The writing has been on the wall and this idea that he is the victim of a gag order is pure BS. It's embezzlement and gambling while trying to game the market, plain and simple. He's not the first to do it and certainly won't be the last. Even before the investigators had enough to arrest him, it was plainly obvious that this was he case. If he was truly the victim of a gag order, then there was no reason for him to concoct lie after lie about transaction malleability, stolen funds and whatever other BS story he's thrown out there.

It's backed by trust, just like all the previous versions of money were. The entire point of money is to trust an exchange where there is no trust between parties. The money is what guarantees you are receiving the value for your goods and services you agree to. The trust was in that the ledger being used was not falsified and was maintained by a trustworthy source, or that the medium of exchange was not easily duplicated/falsified. Ledger systems (which is what Bitcoin is) have been around as long as physical money has and were not based on anything tangible either.
Speculation on the value of money is something that has always gone on in one form or another since the creation of a limited resources. People would hoard gold, silver, precious stones, etc. In hopes that the rarity of the resource used in trading would go up in value. Bitcoin is no different.
It has value as a trustworthy medium of exchange and people are speculating on the limited nature of that limited resources. Bitcoin can't be faked (like gold but unlike paper currency) and it uses an efficient distribution system (unlike precious metals). Because of it's rarity and its utility, people are of course going to speculate that it will be used more in the future and therefore worth more. Sure, those who are special thing are only in it for profit, but it is completely secondary to the trust and utility of the system. 
Speculation is building interest in Bitcoin, but it will eventually be just like any other currency. As people become interested in the technology, they realize the criticism of it being not based on anything physical isn't really an issue as it's about the trust in the technology. It is also valuable as it is increasing the number of average people who are learning about exactly what monetary systems are and how they work.

Exactly. Increasing the block size first only puts additional load on the  hardware and consumes additional bandwidth for minimal gain. Why risk further centralization of mining without doing the due diligence first to minimize risk and optimize transactions to streamline it. 
If we risk the stability of the network or its centralization for minimal gains, it will be a much larger blow to Bitcoin's reputation in the long run than simply taking things cautiously and incrementally. Bitcoin has fought long and hard to get to its current state of recognition, we don't want to fumble the ball by overreaching and risk another team taking the trophy home (Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Stellar, etc.).

Still doesn't matter. They didn't seize funds from everyone's accounts.

Either it was not much money for them and therefore inconsequential, or it was a ruin entirely of their own making in the face of sheer stupidity. That is not something to be sympathized, it's something to be pittied perhaps or even mocked or jeered but do not feel remorse for someone going against the sound advice of an entire community to make stupid bets with money they can't afford to lose.

The only thing a fake coin is in terms of MtGox is simply a ledger balance for an account. That's the thing, none of the coins, real or fake belong to any particular account just like the money you deposit at a real bank. They simply mark down how much your account should be credited then use your deposits for other things. Some of your deposit may be set aside or given out immediately for other customer withdrawal requests but they don't just take your money and put it in a vault. The fake coins on Gox, which I'd be willing to bet are a pretty substantial amount, were never circulated because they're just internal numbers. This is the danger of not maintaining control of your own funds, you have to trust that the bank/exchange is actually solvent enough to meet your demands to withdraw your holdings. Greece is finding out the hard way what happens when the banks don't have the money that there customers think they have in their accounts.

This is what I've been saying from the beginning. He spent customer funds and bitcoins early on to settle debt and expenses assuming he could game the system to pay them back later on. At that point he began operating a fractional reserve and when the price skyrocketed unexpectedly, he got his ass handed to him unable to bring the price back down to where he could repay enough to the reserves to meet customer withdrawals. The writing was on the wall and why Karpeles ever thought anybody would believe transaction malleability could ever have resulted in the amounts lost speaks volumes of his ineptitude at running a business.

Because that's exactly what he did, he kept trying to game the system. I'm pretty sure his line of thinking was that the bubble would crash then he could reap in the profits. The problem is he kept losing more and more with every short sell attempt he got in deeper and deeper in debt than he already was. The house of cards could only stay up so long and the higher the price went, the more the "fake coins" he had credited his account holders with would cost when they withdrew making his liabilities astronomical. The ridiculous thing is that the hundreds of millions of dollars he was liable for was probably only worth a few million or so originally. 
This is the problem with short selling. You're literally gambling with money you don't have and it's extremely easy to get in so far over your head that you keep doubling down hoping to break even again. I'm guessing that he had some other techbical issues that prevented him from accessing the 200k coins that were in his cold wallet which would have possibly kept him afloat much longer, but who knows if/when the bubble would have popped had he been able to. Confidence in Bitcoin would have stayed high and it could easily have gone even higher, making his debt even more expensive. That said, it could have tapered off and he may have been able to eventually gain some ground. It's hard to know without looking at the transaction records, but it could have gone either way depending on if he could have kept up with customer withdrawals. Hell, every bank on the planet operates a fractional reserve so it's not like it's impossible. 
Regardless, I think he just seriously made one bad choice after another trying to cover up what he was doing instead of realizing that he needed help. I think it's pretty obvious that MK's history of being the only one working on the code base and that everything basically had to go through him shows that he was doing everything he could to hide the truth. That ultimately is what makes me have no sympathy for him.

This crap he threw out recently with the corrupt agents on the SR case is no different than the smokescreen he tried to pass off with transaction malleability.

I can understand how he got into a fractional reserve system to grow the business, but I have no sympathy on how he ran it further into the ground with his cover ups, finger pointing and straight up mismanagement of an otherwise successful business. The guy was an amateur playing with other people's livelihoods and frankly he deserves what's coming for him.

Effectively, it's not about banning Bitcoin itself, but major points of currency exchange as that's where the control is easier to apply. Granted, they could never prevent all exchange of Bitcoin to currency and vice versa, but they could put up enough restrictions that effectively strangle it for majority use. If legitimate businesses can be targeted that accept Bitcoin as payment and banks/payroll companies/etc. are prevented from transferring funds to Bitcoin exchanges (let alone exchanges being shutdown under FinCen style laws), then it will seriously impact the usability of it. It would also take a concerted multi-nation effort to effectively make a dent in the ecosystem, but even then, there's nothing that can be done to prevent individuals from directly transacting in Bitcoin.
In short, they could never directly ban Bitcoin obviously, but they can make it difficult to do anything of consequence with it.

That's the thing though, they don't hold your account like a traditional bank would so I imagine new laws would have to be written to allow a government to seize signature keys to transfer the funds. As these are security keys and not bank accounts, I don't believe existing seizure laws would be applicable, but of course IANAL.
As far as this vs a Trezor, I believe this is considered the safer scenario where it's pretty much impossible to screw up or lose access to a wallet by losing the key, hence the attractiveness to a layman.

You don't get to pick and choose, that's the point of a decentralized blockchain. You either allow microtransactions for low/now fees or you make transactions incur a cost so as to prevent abuse. Otherwise you end up with the need for blacklists and whitelist and we certainly don't want to go down that path. We need to do the work to streamline the transactions that go into the blockchain so it is more efficient and the propagation of those blocks to ensure a healthy network under load. If we just start adding block space it will fill up with junk until it either begins to cause network issues or the fees begin to rise again. It's just he nature of dealing with low/no cost transactions.

That said, they are also a service that authorizes the second key of a multi-sig transaction and are also commiting to store a third key as a backup (should the device be lost or damaged) so that you never lose access to your funds.

Actually there is. They're called laws and if you break them, you can and will go to jail. If you open up an unregulated exchange, you become a money transmitter and are directly targeted by FinCen and they will come down hard. Sure, you can get away with in person transactions for a few hundred dollars here and there, but as soon as you start doing any kind of volume and become an easy to track entity, you will be shut down by the government. They see this as money laundering when you don't go through the appropriate channels. 
As much as we like to hate on companies like Coinbase, they have to play by the rules in order to operate. It's why they've had to start collecting verifiable information from users. It's not for their shits and giggles, it's because the federal government has required them to.

Don't fool yourself, halving of a reward is a significant chunk of profit. We just halved to 25 and it's only roughly another 127 days until it's 12.5.

Don't get me wrong, I subscribe to a lot of bitcoin related subreddits so as to not get locked into one point of view, but the more I read on the more I tend to side with core group.

@_date: 2016-02-23 18:13:16
What you're talking about is just that, insurance. Insurance costs money, regardless of whether you see it directly or not. The cost is built into the system. Between regulation and straight up business incentives, you'll likely start seeing some form of insurance in places like exchanges. This will likely be added as a value add for their business to give customers a sense of security. This will likely increase the cost of transactions on the exchange as a result. 
When it comes to privately holding onto Bitcoin however, it's really no different than dealing with cash. If you lose your cash because you misplaced it or just simply destroyed it, you're just SOL. 
Don't mistake something like GOX as a bank failure. This was simply a case of fraud which happens even in the current banking and investment world. Just look at what happened with Enron and Madoff. People lost their shirts over it in the same way. 
The only real insurance that works like you seem to be implying is FDIC guarantees of banks. That only covers up to $250k per depositer, per bank, etc. That's purely to keep people from making a run on the banks like what happened in the 20s and to give the public peace of mind that their funds stored there are safe. It does not mean you cannot lose your money. 
For one thing, it's incredibly easy for a government entity to freeze and seize funds from your account, even if it's just a misunderstanding. When it comes down to it, you do not own the money in your account, it's simply a credit in the same way you mentioned as storing on an exchange. You do not control the access to the account, the bank does. 
Bitcoin is digital cash and can be stored with an entity you trust (like an exchange) or trustless by storing in your own wallet the same way physical cash can be. Just like with cash systems, you can choose to give trust to a 3rd party (hoping they will honor and give you some guarantee your funds are safe) or you can store and make your own transactions directly to the network and trust nobody. It's getting harder and harder for that to be doable with physical cash as governments restrict access to larger denominations and require tracking and paperwork for transactions above certain amounts and frequencies.
If you're looking to give you some guarantee for your own storage of Bitcoin, that's as fairly unrealistic as having someone insure the cash you keep in your safe. Now, could it be covered by something like a homeowner's policy or umbrella insurance? Possibly, but it'd likely be expensive and not worth it since a Bitcoin wallet can easily be made very secure. The idea of having someone hack your wallet is unlikely as long as you aren't stupid and use something easy to crack. It'd be tantamount to setting the combination on your safe to 12345.
In any event, the insurance of the financial system that you speak of does not even exist in the form you seem to think it does currently anyway, it's an illusion. What you're really thinking of are regulation requirements that will be necessary to some degree of exchanges and businesses much like we already do. Credit card companies don't insure their transactions for free either as that cost is passed on to the consumer through higher cost of goods from retailers and interest charges on balances. That there are shady businesses that pop-up and take people's money is no different than in the rest of the history of humanity. Anything that incurs a cost to the system is passed onto the consumers. Insurance is one of these costs. 
That said, there will be business opportunities in this area for people who wish to use them if it seems prudent financially for them. For instance, exchange account insurance, Bitcoin card services that offer balance coverage for a nominal fee, umbrella policies, etc. Unlike cash, Bitcoin is much easier to verify and lock down. With something like an umbrella policy, maybe the insurance company requires that you give them 1 of x keys required to transfer funds from the covered wallet so that they are aware of transfers you make. If there is a market for it, services will arise that will fill this gap. This, just like any other insurance, requires placing trust in a company or some other entity. With the Bitcoin system itself however, no trust is needed.

The first thing out of his mouth is just straight up misunderstanding what the impact of the size of the blockchain has to do with accepting/using Bitcoin in various places.

You keep spouting this line. Increasing the blocksize is a problem not because of storage but because of bandwidth and propagation of blocks.

There's lots of great information on this topic in multiple threads as well as lengthy discussions about the pros and cons of large blocks. Please educate yourself because nobody will take you seriously when you throw out this line as if people are not wanting bigger blocks because they don't have large enough hard drives.

I don't think it's so much that (unless the person saying so really doesn't understand and is just repeating out of context), but rather that an immediate increase to 2mb (worth of transactions) is roughly what SegWit will delivery (obviously only 1.6 if not multi sig). The point is that the cries for immediate relief for block congestion being addressed by SegWit isn't untrue. SegWit will buy some time, much like a small block size increase will, but more work must be done long term. I have seen some people that mistakenly make the argument you mention though.

I'd say that any contentious hard fork will be met with a fairly hard price crash as there will no doubt be a mixture of FUD among investors regarding their current investment prompting a sell off, some investors will see it as an opportunity to reinvest at a lower price per coin which will further add to a precipitous drop in price. I would expect it will probably take a while before the price comes back up, notably after it is clear that any hard fork is no longer in contention (100% adoption). In other words, get ready to see 200s again.

I don't know why people keep seeing it like the internet. It's honestly a lot more similar to something like email which is a protocol used on the physical network of the "internet". Like email, it was difficult to use in its early days but then became ported to more and more devices, supported new and larger/more complicated message types, had necessary size constraints early on to prevent clogging up servers, subject to spam/DoS attacks, privacy concerns, highly decentralized, etc. The list just goes on and on. Internet is just such a vague descriptor and really just means a public network.
The internet is a collection of protocols where as email is a protocol for messaging on that network used for messaging. Bitcoin is basically a protocol in that same sense and subject to the same concerns. You'll have many private businesses that will build their profits by offering services on that backbone, many with their own internal systems integrating to that public one, as well as many free and open source ones. You can even have private email systems that never connect to the outside much like how some private blockchains are being developed.

That's the part I have a hard time with. I think there was obvious manipulation there but i'm not sure for what purpose. It's possible that he gave up trying to short sell after a certain point and was trying to drive the price up super high and then liquidate at a magical number, hoping a large selloff would cause at least a partial crash, but that seems even riskier. Still, I wouldn't put it past him. There's just so much incompetency with Gox that it's likely part of the same story of price manipulation that got out of control.

At it's lowest in 2015, it was 214 but that was only after a precipitous drop from the previous year which coincided with a significant increase in miners. What is the likelihood that the larger operations are going to shutdown before the smaller ones though? My concern is what the long term outlook is for mining centralization if smaller groups stop because of an inability to recoup losses if the price doesn't grow fast enough. Had Hearn not dropped a bomb on the community, shaking the faith of investors, we might very well be in the high 500s or mid 600s now and this wouldn't be less of an issue. I'm not convinced that we have seen the last of the mid 300s yet.
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:29:37
You can only go so long before you have to start recouping costs. As miners sell, it puts downward pressure as they introduce the added currency into the market place, thus lowering their profits on existing holdings. 
It's all fine and well to think that miners will sit on their coins until they can sell them for such a markup, but with the stagnation of the price over the last 2 years, it will be increasingly difficult to continue as rewards continue to halve while the price doesn't rise to keep up.

It's easy to be libertarian when you have sufficient wealth to cover everything, including paying for private versions of public services/works.
What impresses me is not the wealthy libertarian, that's typically a given, it's the wealthy socialist that does. People who realize that even though they're set for life (often with enough wealth for many lifetimes), that other people are not and are in a system that has little to no safety nets should something happen. Having a house fire, a serious medical condition requiring hospitalization and/or surgery, or even a temporary loss of employment can seriously destroy an average person's precarious finances. 
The sad fact is that a large number of people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, let alone live with a significant amount of debt, not because they are careless with their money, but because they literally cannot afford to save enough money to be of any real significance should a major problem arise. For people in that upper wealth class, there is such a disconnect in understanding what it's like to be in that situation. Sure, they might have an investment that loses them millions of dollars and they might have to sell their vacation home or not purchase a new car this year, but the idea that they could be at risk to have their utilities shut off, go hungry or lose their home, just doesn't enter their mind. They see hardship based not on being able to live but on not being able to live comfortably or lavishly.

I get your point, but to think that Coinbase's userbase would have any reason to continue doing business with them if they left Bitcoin is pretty ridiculous. The only reason they have a userbase is because they allow easy access to using the Bitcoin network. Switching to something like Litecoin even would seriously damage their business to the point of failure because it invalidates the entire purpose of the company's existance, to easily buy, sell and trade BTC.

But conversely, you are saying that simply increasing the blocksize will allow low fee microtransactions again. You can't have it both ways. What keeps transaction volume manageable is that it starts to cost real money when you spam the network with lots of transactions. The whole reason why the cap was put there in the first place was to prevent overloading the network. It's exactly what the focus is on in scaling Bitcoin currently. More work has to be done to streamline transactions and the transport layer as well as building additional layers to significantly increase the capacity of the network. Simply increasing the blocksize isn't going to do it and the quicker we grow the blocksize without doing the due diligence work up front, the larger the problem becomes to address.

As more players get involved in the tech though, the expectation for quick processing must stay high. Even with significantly increasing the blocksize and on top of all the streamlining efforts that are currently being worked on, blockspace will still become heavily saturated. Thousands, if not tens of thousands of trades take place every second between these firms so I'm sure they're want to settle accounts quickly in order to maintain as close to an even standing at all times. Add into that the expectation that more businesses are building solutions to integrate with Bitcoin, it's only going to become more crowded. Sidechains are going to be a very necessary reality because not everything needs to happen on the main blockchain of Bitcoin and it's the only way we'll be able to appropriately scale appropriately should the demand increase as much as expected.

Because it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If they put a date out that's too far (for those who are screaming for a block size increase now), or too soon and not be able to realistically make it, thus missing a deadline, this whole thing will still be an issue and the core team will lose credibility in their roadmap as a whole. Instead, they've laid out the technical work that needs to be done as part of an overall scaling solution, as best as they can, without making any unrealistic promises. It's very possible a larger cap than 2mb might be needed once everything has been streamlined. Hopefully at that point, block propagation will be less of an issue as bandwidth increases and the network grows as a whole, hopefully remaining as distributed as it is now, if not more so.

Seconded on securing the email account. This is the most common way accounts are infiltrated. Setup a dedicated email account with Gmail and secure it with 2FA on top of the 2FA security for your exchange accounts. Ideally you could separate each exchange account to it's own email address for maximum separation, but that can get tedious and a bit overkill depending on how much you have invested. Still, what the poster above says should be the bare minimum security you should start with. Do not trust SMS authentication and keep hard copies of your Gmail 2FA backup codes secured somewhere like in an actual safe in case you loose access to Authenticator/Authy.

Agreed, and I would totally be down to do it through my bank or some other entity if only to encourage competition, particularly if it was offered at a lower rate. Unfortunately, Coinbase is the only game in town, that I'm aware of, that offers such a service. It's disposable income that I don't miss if it's small amounts and taken out regularly so in the end, it's extremely advantageous to use the service, despite the slightly high fee.

Instead of buying in big chunks, setup a weekly buy of a set amount and just leave it. It adds up and you don't have to worry about what price you bought at.

It still takes almost a week, but your bank will typically withdraw inside 24hrs. Basically you won't have access to those funds in transfer for several days usually. I have yet to see a transfer take less than 72 hours. I can make more buying via instant than I save trying to do cash deposit.

The greater likelihood is that the bulk of those coins never actually existed and were the result of a poor attempt at a fractional reserve system that blew up in Karpeles face.

Willybot. It may sound counter intuitive but he was selling fake coins (they were only internal account credits basically) generating incoming cash, but he still had outflow at the time. I think he figured he would drive the price up to ridiculous levels which would cause he bubble to pop, then he could make out like a bandit once it did by buying real coins to settle up once it bottomed out. Problem was he ran out of liquid funds which caused him to have to cease withdrawals. It's pretty clear what happened. 
Prick got greedy and dipped into customer funds early on (probably regularly too) and figured he could fame the system since he had majority control of the market and he was the only one with access to the accounting and the code. Smug bastard deserves what he's getting. He figured he could game the system and he got fucked hard.

You're missing the point that he never had the bulk of the missing funds. They were artificial in the system as the original money used to buy the bitcoins was spent prior to the huge jump in price. He intended to wait out the bubble, selling fake coins (internal account credit) on the way up, and buy the actual coins on the open market once it popped. This is why he had willybot running working to artificially drive the price up. As more and more people assumed real bitcoins value was increasing, they rushed to get in on it paying real money. As there was still the need for working withdrawals he of course then had to use some funds to purchase enough real coins from other exchanges in order to keep up appearances. The problem is that the bubble never crashed before he became insolvent (200k cold wallet he could access likely due to bad code or perhaps his own personal stash) so of course he could never make up the difference. He was betting that he could ride out the bubble, selling fake coins all along the way, but it went much higher and longer than he likely antipated and could no longer keep up appearance of solvency. Based on how withdrawals were delayed and eventually unavailable, it's pretty clear that this is exactly what happened. It's also the reason why he didn't allow anyone to see his code or the internal books within his own company. That alone should have been red flags.

Acceleration of the bubble peak. It makes sense when you think about it. He alone would have trouble driving the price down by selling because everyone was buying, he'd only find himself selling coins below market rate. So instead, by driving the price up to unforseen highs, it was inevitable that it would crash and crash hard. The problem was he likely misjudged how far it would go up before popping as nobody thought it would go that high so quickly.

But why hold onto something that goes up and down when you can sell on an upswing and buy on a downswing. Just letting it sit stagnant when there's been a peak which will likely be followed by a drop means I can cash out a portion (instead of dipping into savings or other investments) and then buy back in after it drops. Don't assume you know my financial situation. 
All I was doing was complaining that I didn't cash out at the top. It will be dropping again (as it always does) to settle back down somewhere in between the last stable point and its peak at which I will buy back more than I had before. This is what I've been doing for the last couple of years and it's continually netted me more bitcoin each time. Doesn't mean I can't moan a bit for not catching the top or the bottom of a swing. Chill out and worry about people who say they're buying bitcoin on credit cards. Those are the ones you should be bitching at.

What bait? If you've been around as long as I have then you'd know this is the line thrown out every year. Nobody's saying we're not going to succeed, especially me considering how much I have invested in it at this point. 
I'm just saying we have to temper our expectations at grandiose statements and work towards the long term goal with steady growth instead of trying to convince everyone that something's about to explode in popularity overnight only to disappoint some when it does not. It's the only way we'll continue to be taken seriously by ever increasing business interests with the professional community and the general populace at large. 
We still have a long way to go to convince the world that we're a serious technological innovation and not just some sort of get rich quick investment scheme. Many of us believe in the long term impacts this technology will make. Many more people out there don't. Let's be a slow burn, not a flash in the pan. Slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2016-05-09 21:54:02
I have high hopes for bitcoin long term, but this is the exact same thing that was said early in the year in 2014 and 2015 by many people. My point is that proclaiming that "this year will be big for Bitcoin" is a statement that keeps getting thrown out there but doesn't seem to hit the mark. It's growing, building mass, but not at the rate that many people would like it to from an investment standing. It's going to take time.
Unless there's a major paradigm shift that occurs, I expect it will simply continue to cultivate mass over the next 2-3 years before a point of criticality is reached. That said, it could all change overnight if some major trigger happens. What that might look like, I have no idea.

No. Fuck him. He had a history of incompetence running that site due in large part to his arrogance. Besides, even if there was some theft, it is highly dubious that the bulk of the "missing" bitcoin actually ever existed. Most of the signs point to Karpeles attempting to manipulate the market in order to salvage a failed fractional reserve. I have zero doubt that he mismanaged customer funds and got himself into a hole he could dig himself out of. If this had simply been a case of theft, it would have been fairly easy to at least see the movement of such a large number of coins on the blockchain.

You've missed the boat on that if you're talking about mining Bitcoin. Unless you live somewhere with very cheap or heavily subsidized electricity, it's unlikely you'll ever break even witht he cost of mining rigs and everything. You're looking at a large, upfront investment to get into mining which has high utility costs. You'd be much better off taking the same investment and just buying Bitcoin at this point. 
You could always mine an altcoin but those are like the wild west comparatively. I'd only seriously consider that if Bitcoin itself was in a lull.

Not really. When you have an extreme rise followed by a precipitous drop, it was very clearly a bubble. Just because you have a bubble doesn't mean the overall trend isn't going up or that it's the end of it. We very clearly were in a bubble. It rose way faster than it should have and a collapse to a more sane level was inevitable. I think we'll see it bounce down to the 1800s before we get back to a steady growth trend before all is said and done.

I wasn't saying you specifically, but you're defending his position here.

The man was a coin collector who bought them/received them from someone else, he didn't steal them. You could argue that someone sold/gave him stolen property but nobody, including the official ruling, states that he stole them.

And who do you think ends up paying for all the fraudulent charges in the end? It's still passed on to the customers through fees and interest rates.

I had not heard of a Google authenticator that had a backup/restore method. Been using a third party app on rooted phones to do this.

Somebody should tell that to Anthony Weiner.

But when you accuse a person who didn't steal them of the theft, that's simply wrong.

Stop trying to make dogecoin a thing. It's not going to happen.

Had a friend that had a large settlement and I told him to invest 10% back when it was around $350ish. He only bought $100 and I constantly hear him crying about how he wishes he'd bought more then. I keep telling him it's not too late but he won't listen. I expect to hear him moan more in the future.

Had trouble reading that, use a larger font next time.

Bitcoin isn't based on a shitty meme.

Perhaps he plans on taking a massive steaming load on it.

You're changing the subject. I'm just correcting your false statement that the CC fraud doesn't affect customers.

What about slightly above average? Is there a bell curve adjustment? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:20:58
But they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:07:24
Because the doge meme was idiotic to begin with.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:24:17
Seems like there's a few haters out there downvoting Coinbase praise. I think they've done a decent job so far.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:43:00
Normally I do. That meme makes me bleed from the eyes though.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:28:04
Don't do that!
