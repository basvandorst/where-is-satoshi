Everything you need to buy to survive is priced in dollars. Even websites that accept bitcoin, the dollar price doesn't change when the price of bitcoin fluctuates. The price in bitcoin does.

Brick weed is still common in prohibition states. The only upside is that it hasn't gotten more expensive since the 90s - at all. It's still $20 an eighth, $100 an oz in my hometown, and has been the same price since I was a teenager. "Good" aka medical-grade is $50/8th, which incidentally is the same price I paid at a dispensary when I was travelling through Denver.

I have an account on bitcoin talk, but for some reason whenever I try to leave a reply to a thread, it says I have already made a comment in the last X amount of seconds and I have to wait... but it never leaves any comments and it says that every single time. So frustrating.

I think he wandered out of and got lost...

When did I say I was refusing to donate? I would prefer to donate in bitcoin, of course.

I don't know where all the negativity is coming from. I donated what I could afford, then as an afterthought I made a post here. It seems to have taken off so apparently other people think it's a good idea, too. I don't know why that makes me a prick, I'm just trying to raise awareness for DWB - they can use all the help they can get.
Sorry if I offended you.

Yes but like any business, Red Star Mining values their reputation. They didn't pack up shop and leave, the website they were using to sell shares went down... the shares still exist, I am sure they are still sitting there in their records with my BTCT account info tied to them. I was hoping I would be able to contact someone from RSM via reddit since other avenues have failed me. I'm sure they could help me out if I could just talk to someone!

Not every position in the organization are doctors on the ground. There are plenty of paper pushers who are looking at ways to increase donations, and the publicity that accepting bitcoin would bring them from this subreddit alone would be worth it... I imagine the announcement would hit front page considering the worldwide ebola situation. Not to mention the actual donations in bitcoin - I'm sure there are many people who are "bitcoin rich" but cash poor at the moment and would be more willing to give (or more willing to give *more*) if they had bitcoin available to them as a payment option.


Thank you so much! This post was worth it just for that.

Damn, I just bought a year of reddit gold with bitcoin a couple weeks ago  :X
@_date: 2014-10-18 15:36:12
Well that certainly was not my intention, and I apologize if I came off that way. I just like bitcoin, and I like DWB, and it seems like they would be good together :P That's the only motivation I had for this post.

Actually they get paid in 1s and 0s that digitally represent dollars on a computer screen. /s

~~You're being quite dramatic, and a little silly tbh - if anything this post is raising awareness for DWB and encouraging donations, I'm not holding anything *hostage,* lol.~~
Edit: OK, point taken. :/

Apparently when they ship it to the US they pasteurize it so it doesn't spoil. Obviously the unpasteurized beer tastes better, as you said.

Fuck, is that what that is? I was wondering why the artist chose to put a giant light bulb and a human skull in the wires... I thought maybe the one dude hanging in the wires fell from some height and caused an accident that dislodged live wires and killed other people on the ground.

So basically, you would have made more money by buying BTC and then doing nothing at all.
