There will be no money left for the ones choosing legal action.
Extremely illegal.
Any gambling site offering odds on this actually happening?
No lawyer would ever sign off on this.

Bankruptcy is a gift to the creditors who now are forced to not sell for a few years. By the time it is resolved in court, btc will be worth multiples of its current value, and everyone will win except fiat holders.
It is basically an illiquid european call option on BTCs value with a 2+ year maturity.
Unknown values are the recovery rate, maturity and BTC price.

You will never be allowed to withdraw funds.
The court will disperse any funds.
No idea why you guys think because this is a BTC business, that it would be treated any differently to any other insolvent corporation.

It WILL go into bankruptcy. There is no IF

They will never allow withdrawals. They cannot by law.
The company is insolvent. 
When this case is resolved, the court will disperse the funds.
The fact they even made public this haircut proposal shows how amateur this operation is.
Their counsel will propose this haircut to the court. The court will decide.
This will be a long drawn out battle in court. There is NO alternative legally.
I think they did a disseervice leading people on that they would be able to withdraw anything anytime soon.
Transparency is cool and shit, but not when you are misinforming the public.
The correct move for them would have been to lawyer up and shutup.

No funds will ever be allowed to be withdrawn for many years until resolved in court. 
It is not up to binfinex to determine any haircut rate. This must be done by the courts.
Nobody will see any money for a few years.

I think not one person who is savvy enough to know what bitcoin is, would ever pay for porn no matter how low your prices are.
if you get even one sale, i would be shocked.
