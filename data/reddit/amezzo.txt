Nevertheless that exchange looks serious and it's settled in USA. IMO that is another big step for Bitcoin, regardless of the butter.

Hello I guess you are a new user!
No, Bitcoin has NOT go bankrupt, it was an exchange settled in Japan named Mt. Gox (CEO: Mark Karpeles - big noob!)
Let's consider Bitcoins' system with Email. If Yahoo shuts down Email is still possible, right? Same with Bitcoin. 
More information on YouTube or  and

There was a governmental ban in Vietnam, I read the document. How is that possible?
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:19:12
to relate the currently situation with 2 years ago is ridiculous
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:44:20
But why there have to be banks?
If you need Bitcoins you will ever have the chance to buy them at marketplaces or exchanges. Ok, what about not having money to buy? Then you loan it from a FIAT bank and buy bitcoins finally. There is NO NEED for bitcoin banks and I think it would be the first step in the right financial system.

Hello Flourescents!
If you're looking for an apartement you (afaik) won't find any website offering that. But would recommend to ask here: 
Bitcoin.de is the main german marketplace for bitcoin with the biggest german community. Probably someone will answer.

Buffett: Bitcoin ‘isn’t a currency’
In response to a question about bitcoin, Buffett said it “isn’t a currency” and he “wouldn’t be surprised” if it’s not around in 10 or 20 years. Since the price keeps moving around so dramatically, “It’s very speculative, a Buck Rogers kind of thing” like the Dutch tulip mania in 1637.  -

All you traders and annoyers don't realize that the problems with Gox affect the whole system, prices will fall - people loose trust. WE HAVE TO STAND THAT TOGETHER! Bitcoin is a new technology with a big future!
