ok that sounds perfect someone recommended that i download adn sync bitcoin core thoughts? started it already so just curious 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:26:46
and to clarify, main purpose is to just get the coins off now, i fully intend to open a easier wallet. Just want to get these off, and gotta get it online first haha

ok got my passphrase reset and i found my address where the money was sent. 
Went to electrum and made a new wallet with pre existing keys i think was what it was called. Its currently saying "Please wait..." once i entered in the PrivBase code. Afraid to do anything so just letting it do whatever it is doing.

i did, this provided little help!
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:56:06
to clarify, i have the keys, i found the PrivBase58 ,    PrivHexBE , the root key as well, the public x and y, im just trying to make a new wallet  through electrum and thats where i am stuck, trying to make a new wallet and then at the keystore screen i select i have keys already and enter them and then it just says please wait for along time and i closed it out after 3 hours of nothing

your replies have been amazing and super helpful, but ive come to a bigger issue, not having my passphrase it seems. Idk how or where it got lost or something but I dont have it.
If i finish installing bitcoin core, would that get armory online and then id be able to access my wallet right on armory?
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:18:39
yes i would love a new wallet, any web wallet or anything really. I wont be using it much honestly, maybe once every 2 or 3 months. 
I thought since these funds were already on my armory wallet that they couldnt be moved, i know BTC isn't reversible and movable i thought at least.
this chat is helping my anxiety over never getting this back alot!

yea, no way of getting that back i assume lol

im having trouble finding the private key, still syncing up BTC Core atm, quite the process. Passphrase it seems is something that I need, not sure where that is.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:15:02
Ok knowing what the private keys are is tricky, can i find them by being offline?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:35:03
i have tried a few things, i did a wallet -&gt; private keys -&gt; sweep and entered my private key but dont see my balance changed
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:59:39
Im sorry if i didnt clarify, i have coins in my wallet, but i cannot see them, because it is offline, it seems, and i might not be correct, but this wallet is used for cold storage more often than most.
