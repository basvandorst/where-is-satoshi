There's a Robert heinlein story where the main character is the head of a colony on a new planet. He has had to create stability and currency for an economy to help motivate work. He surprises a citizen one day by burning the money the citizen had just paid him for an owed debt. It wasn't an insult to him. He simply explained to the citizen that each bill was actually a debt HE owed to the holder. This point he is ready to move on to another planet so it's in his interest to destroy the money.

Really well put. Thanks for your reply. 
I guess we'll see before very long if the growth of real bitcoin businesses will be fast enough to sustain the price as pure 'non participating' speculators eventually decide to pull out of BTC. 
It hasn't even been a week since this last price surge and though it dropped momentarily it's pretty much back up to near peak levels. That seems like a slightly different pattern than the previous few booms where it crashed and then settled somewhere between the peak and the previous stable price. China's increased participation is clearly changing the pattern. 
This is an exciting time in history.

"Banned" how would they stop it. 
Walk up. Hold up phone. Nod or look confused. Then proceed with transaction as one does.

How about speculation alone with no other economic activity constitutes a bubble. It means the speculators are in a circle jerk and eventually someone's gonna splooge all over the place.

I would argue that this is not a bad thing in an economy. Investment requires savings. A currency that deflates over time encourages savings but capital will still flow in the direction of the people who can best invest it and best decrease relative levels of scarcity. The deflation of bitcoin puts a check on over investment. This means that the businesses that operate within the bitcoin economy will actually see sustained growth. It's not investment and successful business that creates the boom bust cycle. It's over investment resulting in waste and mis allocated resources that results in an artificial boom and subsequent bust.

So you're familiar with ABCT
How is the value of a currency increasing over time not an example of deflation?
Also, if you meant to simply make the point that the bitcoin economy needs more business and transactions beyond speculation I agree and I misunderstood your comment. But I believe that will improve in time and the the deflationary nature of BTC is one of its greatest strengths and not to be lamented.
