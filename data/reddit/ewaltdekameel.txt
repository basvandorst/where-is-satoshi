Well, that's not what I meant to say.
But since you brought it up: why not? What makes you think that a head of a state would kill in name of the state, while the head of a gang would not kill? Or the head of the mafia, or the head of any other type of organization? Especially if there was no such thing as a state to stop gangs etc. from killing?
It just seems so clear to me that it's not states that kill people. People kill people. It has been this way all throughout history, and its like this anywhere in the world. What about the Persians, Ghengis Khan, the crusades, even the Maya's. People get killed in Somalia on a regular basis, they don't have a (functioning) state! What about all of the homicides that are commited EVERY DAY despite the state monopolie on violence which you guys keep bringing up?
I just can't grasp why you guys seem to think people magically started killing when states arose, and will magically stop doing so if states are abolished.
It's scarsity and human nature that makes people kill, I think. Not states. If anything, states can potentially stop people from doing so.
Also, how about that alternative?
Oh and PS: how are you guys still finding this post? It's like a week old...

My point is that this will happen anyway, whether we give it to them or not. In fact, it is exactly what did happen, before we had governments. That's kind of why we have them.

Wow, sad to hear you have literaly no idea what you're talking about. Apparently you don't even know what a state is. Come on man. Here, all the information is free for you to read:
Ghenghis Kahn was the head of an empire. Not a state.
The An Lushan Rebellion was... well, a rebellion. Not a state. (You should've been able to figure this one out on yourself.)
Xin Dynasty was an empire. Not a state.
What you seem to be suggesting is that it's not state's that are bad, but human organizations whatsoever. What you do not seem to realize, however, is that this will happen anyway. You know why? Because people will *want* to organize themselves. Because it's human nature to do so. If people had never organized we'd still be fighting of lions on the planes of Africa, and be very bad at it on our own. (The more realistic scenario is that humanity had been extinct a long long time ago.)
People will organize, because that's what they want to do. There's nothing you can do about human nature, and if there would be something you could do about it, that would be a ridiculous limitation on your so beloved freedom.
Now, since people can do bad things by their very nature, as well as good things, that means organizations will do bad things as well, as well as good things. The real question is how to maximise the good and minimise the bad. At this point I think that a properly functioning state, with a constitution and popular sovereignty and democracy and all that, might be it, right now.

I never said Luxembourg or Norway are perfect examples of what a state should be like. I mentioned these (pretty succesful) countries (GDP wise, btw) because of your overly ridiculous statement that Marx is discredited. By whom is he discredited then? By you? By your supersmart talk radio host? 'Cause he is certainly not discredited by a shitload of succesful politicians and scholars all over the world.
Anyways, for the rest you're absolutely right. Abolish the state, and oppression and violence will magically disappear. That's also why Somalia is a paradise. I'm being sarcastic right now by the way, in case you didn't notice.
As for the rest:


*further arguments*


*clearly has no idea what either Marx or Malthus have written but calims to know it all.*
I do, however, think there's two things we can both agree on.
1. The two of us are not gonna be able to have a fruitful discussion. (For me this is because I think you have a dogmatic belief in posession and ridicule anything that does not adhere to this dogma. For you it's apparently because I think the worldviews of Marx and Malthus are very useful in understanding the realities the world poses; mainly scarsity.)
2. We both think bitcoin is awesome.
So it's probably best to leave it at that.
Have a nice day.

This would only be true if Satoshi Nakamoto was either a Libertarian or an Anarcho-Capitalist or anything of the sorts. I have yet to see prove of that.

@_date: 2013-04-21 09:00:21


In a functional democracy, that shouldn't be too hard. If the people decide bitcoin is a good thing to have, then that should be that. Vote for the politician who agrees on bitcoin, and if there isn't one who does that, become him. The government is not - or shouldn't be - some foreign entity, like you seem to be suggesting.


Hmno, I'm saying inflation has disadvantages. It's pretty clear that it does. If your savings diminish in value, or need to work more for the same amount of stuff to buy, that's a disadvantage. I do agree controlling the moneysupply could have advantages as well, like those you mention.
However, the current financial system is clearly broken. The investmentbanks have basicly taken over the global economy by becoming both to big to fail and to big for jail. Most of the moneyprinting we've seen the last couple of years has been because of these partys. This has nothing to do with the advantages of inflation you just mentioned, it has everyting to do with concentrating all the wealth in the pockets of the very very few - speak about hoarding.
Do I think bitcoin is the answer? I don't know, but I actually think it might be. Having an alternative to the current money-monopoly the banks have at the moment might actually be the solution. If not to take over the world entirely - like I said, I don't see this happening any time soon - then at leats to SHOW that we have an alternative. Kind of like a checks and balance system.

It sounds to me like you think bitcoin is democratic.
My problem, however (and I think this is OP's problem as well), is that the sidebar of this sub says 'Libertarian' and 'Anarcho-Capitalist'.

The currency has an effect because you can't just print extra bitcoin. Right now you have politicians who can just decide to print more money in order to bail out the banks, therefore devaluing *everybodys* money. You can't do that with bitcoin. It would take away one possibility to fuck us over. Simple as that, really.


Sorry you're right, this is the Falkvinge article I meant to link to:
"I think Bitcoin has the potential to become the de facto international trade currency, replacing the dollar in that area. I don’t think, for the foreseeable future, it can replace the dollar when buying a cup of coffee in Atlanta, or getting an espresso in Italy."
"*But you think it could become an Esperanto for the currency world?*"
"That’s an excellent way of putting it."
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:42:37
No I believe that you should rely on historic evidence. The question is which historic evidence you should use. It's kind of like how some people like to point out that bitcoin was worth 266$ and down to 80$ - while I prefer to point out that it's up more that 500% in six months alone and we have just witnessed another hypecycle like we have done before.
I also think that Frankehs arguments are absolute invalid - if anything they apply to fiat currency.
What's *your* issue though? If you believe that bitcoin is an epic fail - don't buy any. If you think that I will lose money if I exhange dollars for bitcoin, how is that your problem? Shouldn't you be kind of happy that I would lose money, since you seem to hate me so much? 'Cause that's kind of like how feel. If I would like you, I would try to convince you why bitcoin is a great investment. But you seem like an asshole, so I'm actually hoping you *don't* buy any bitcoin, and miss the boat...
Also, English is not my first language, and since we're having this discussion in English, I'm pretty certain that that means I speak more languages than you do. ie. a 'moron' apparantly speaks more languages than you do.

First of all, 33 downvotes to my comment in a thread that's like four days old? Are you guys like rallying up or something? I gotta say, that's pretty impressive. Way to organize yourselves!
Second, I would like it if we could have an adult conversation, in stead of all the riduculing. The downvoting is kind of childish as well, but I don't care to much for that.
Now for your arguments. You guys keep coming up with enforcing people as a 'legal' practice. I don't care much for this word. I do, however, think people will enforce each other to do something no matter what. I think this is a part of human nature, regardless of the type of organization. It has happened all through history, and nowadays happens everywhere in the world. It happens in monarchies, dictatorships, mafia, gangs, yes, even in anarchies like Somalia - although you could argue these are gangs doing it of course (which then proves why anarchie doesnt work: gangs will form). And yes, it happens in democratic republics as well. Whether it's 'legal' or not I don't care, I see no difference between 'legally' forcing someone to do something, or 'illegally' doing it.
On a side note, I also think there are situations in which enforcing someone to do something is not immoral. If somebody is hoarding all the food in a village and the rest will die since they need to eat, I think it's perfectly moral to force him to share some of the food. This is because I think morality can easily be applied to the rules of nature. If it's a question of kill or be killed, killing is not immoral, I think. There's other examples to give, but let's not dwell.
So, back on topic. 'Cause this is the main point I want to make. (I've done it before, and I'll probably do it again.) I'm a pragmatist. And I think a democratic republic is the best pragmatic solution for the problems posed by reality (mainly scarsity). This is exactly because it *restricts* people from enforcing stuff upon eachother, due to constitutions(/bill of rights) and the trias politica and stuff. They do not have these restrictions protecting the people in most other forms of organizations.
Any time I explain this sort of stuff in this sub, people start telling me why a democratic republic is not perfect. The thing is, I knów this. In fact, everybody knows this. It's like Churchill said:
"No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."
Therefore, I've asked time and again for alternatives. Because I'm interested what they might be. I can't think of any that are better, as long as there is scarsity. Nobody seems to have any suggestions around here, though.
It's very easy to say what's wrong with the world, but it becomes completely pointless to do so if you have no solutions, no alternatives.
Oh and I agree that a lot of representative democracies are not funtioning very well at the moment. But I think this is mainly because of corruption. But it's like when your car is broken. You dont say: "Well obviously cars dont work, Ill just walk from now on." No, you get your car fixed. And in the very worst case you get a new car.


No, not at all. I'm arguing that the world (or: human nature) is not as black and white as many of you seem to be suggesting. I thinks it's some sort of grey.

Allright. Well, in that case we should have Socialism, Feminism, Liberalism, Conservatism, Envirnomentalism, etc. in the sidebar as well, since you can defend bitcoin from the perspectives of all of these ideologies in some way or another. Either all of them, or non at all.

Sorry, I think my English is pretty decent, but I don't know what this means.


Personally when I get into conversations with people about stuff, I'm not trying to convince them I am right about anything. I do however like to explain to people why I think they are *not* entirely in the right, which is in turn probably often conceived as me trying to prove I'm right.
Case in point: around here I'm often regarded as a socialist and a statist, while some of my friends think I'm a liberal, others thinks I'm an anarchist, etc.
As for bitcoin, I'm literally willing to bet I can defend it from any ideology. (Coming to think about it conservatism might be a little bit of stretch, but I'll figure something out.) That is why I think there should not be any ideologies in the sidebar. None at all, or all of them.

Yessir. What do you think has been inconsistent?
I'll lay it out:
-I think it's human nature to organize ourselves. It's in our DNA. Because it has (had) a lot of benefits.
-Therefore, people will organize. It will happen. I know I will.
-This has good sides, but also bad sides. (Since people have bad sides, as well as good sides.)
-Therefore, I think the question is, how do we maximise the good, and minimise the bad?
-I think that at this point, the way to do this is through a representative democracy. A government for the people, by the people.
-I am open to hear alternatives though. (I haven't heard any yet.)

There's no way to be sure, I agree. That's kind of the problem with history as a science: correlation does not mean causation. But I do find it to be the most logical conclusion in this case. Why? Main reason is that the state can enable social mobility, which benefits society as a whole.


You are confusing *the* state (probably: your state) with the current western monetary system. These two are not inherently connected, and have not always been. And do not always need to be.
I think this is the main error in reasoning of a lot of bitliebers, by the way.


If you mean what I think you mean this is actually a very intersting idea (which I have come across before). Like, if murder was morally right then everybody would murder each other, thereby killing everybody in the end, which means it would become impossible to kill anymore, thus it would be self-defeating? And therefore can't be morally right? I like that idea.
However, do note that is is based on rationality, just like the social contract which I think you rejected exactly because of that reason.
Moreover, just because it's not moral, does not mean it won't happen in reality. Some people might not agree, and think it is perfectly moral to rape your doughter, and steal your wife's car. Here's where the social contract comes in. The state might not be perfect, but I think it's a lesser evil
Personally I would consider myself a post-modernist, which means I think there is no such a thing as 'real' truth (including morality) or at least it is impossible to know. It's all in the eye of the beholder.
There are however practical uses for ideas. I personally think the social contract, popular sovereignty and democracy are very useful. That's why I *choose* to not rebel against these things.
Maybe one day we can do without, and that would be great. But (probably) as long as we have scarsity I don't think that is the case. If you can convince me how to get the good things a state supplies (relative safety, healthcare, roads, schools, etc.) without the bad things I might change my mind. Right now I haven't heard any plausible alternatives.
I will read Molyneux when I have some free time though, thanks.

Hitler got into office democratically, but he did not lead his country into war nor commit the holocaust as a democratic leader. He had grabbed the power in a very undemocratic manner before that, and became a dictator.
This can always happen within a democracy, or any other system for that matter. And it has happened many times.
I would argue that the rise of Hitler shows us that we should defend and fight for democracy, not seek to get rid of it.
Also, but this is kind of besides the point, you could argue that the Weimar republic was not a functional democracy in the first place, since the people were not sovereign; they were subject to international law/punishment since losing the first world war.

Look, if you want to promote bitcoin from a libertarian standpoint, I'm totally cool with that. I really am. If you want to do it in this sub, or on national television, or on IRC, or wherever the hell you want, that's absolutely fine by me.
But you should then promote bitcoin from your *own* standpoint. Not from the standpoint of the *bitcoin community*. 
Nobody should be allowed to speak for the bitcoin community. Nobody should claim what the bitcoin community is or is not. Nor do I think that anybody except for Satoshi, *maybe* Gavin, should make a claim of what bitcoin is.
This is why I think the sub's in the sidebar should be removed. It's pretty clearly making a claim on behalf of the bitcoin community. I think that's wrong and conflicts with the decentralized nature of bitcoin.

What are you basing this statement on? Or: what ideology says anything about the choice of money?
I think you (and a lot of AnCaps and Libertarians) are mistaking 'ideology' for 'policy'.
Quantitative easing is not a part of any ideology. It's a policy. The federal reserve system is not a part of any ideology. It's a policy. Keynes did not come up with an ideology. He came up with a policy.
Liberalism is an ideology. Socialism is an ideology. Anarchism is an ideology. Fascism is an ideology.
These are two very different things. I guess you could argue that bitcoin could be classified in the 'policy' spectrum. But it has nothing to do with ideology whatsover in any intrinsic way. That is actually the beauty of it - I think.

Coincidentally, I just stumbled upon a pretty cool chart, check it out:
Particularly note the box in the bottom left with the percentages. There's not a single state in the top 5.
Yes, states do top the chart in absolute numbers, but that obviously has everything to do with technology (gas chambers, machine guns, nuclear bombs) and the amount of people alive to kill in the first place, and nothing to do with the state system in itself.
Give Genghis Khan a world population of several billions and modern technology to kill with and you'd see some really nasty stuff. State or no state.

It's as if a tourists that got cought up in the recent earthquake in Japan asks someone whether it's always like that. Even though the continental plates are always moving, and Japan witnesses earthquakes on a pretty regular basis, that obviously doesn't mean  it's always like it was that one day.

Ok, so just to get things straight:
1. We (seem to) agree that when large price movements (volatility) occur simultaneously with exchange dysfunction, it is likely to spell big trouble for Bitpay and bitcoin merchants. So, take away the dysfunctional exchanges, and you take away the problem. Therefore, Bitpay in itself is not the problem, it's just not the solution to a bigger problem, namely: dysfunctional exchanges.
2. You're arguing that bitcoin has some inherent shortcomings that impair its usefulness as money.
The second point seems to be a whole other discussion, but interesting nontheless so I'll go with it. (Even though I don't have all the time in the world right now.)


I simply do not agree with this theory. I honestly belief this theory is flawed. It's wrong. Here's why: I don't think anything in the world has such a thing as intrinsic value. Not houses, cars, shares, commodities, nor even gold. There's no such thing as industrial value, or exchange value, or anything of the sort. Of course there is practical use for gold, and practical uses for other stuff, but I do not belief this gives it its value.
Then where does value come from? It comes from *us*! We ourselfes give stuff value, by valueing it. I honestly, truly belief, that's all theres to it. Therefore we can value anything we want, however much we want to value it. It can be gold, fiat, beans, sigarettes, seashelves, teddybears, and yes it can bitcoins... it can be literally anything we choose.
I think a much better way to compare currency, is with language. There is no intrinsic meaning to the word "dog" for instance. There is nothing about a dog that makes it so that we call it a "dog". The only reason we both know what I'm talking about right now, is an "agreement". We just "agreed" that the word "dog" in fact refers to a dog. Therefore *we* give the word (or language) its meaning, or: value.
Another (but comparable) way to look at it, is through Foucaults concept of truth. Replace "truth" with "value", and you'll pretty much understand what I think the nature of value (and thus: money) is.
Now, for the volatility (g2g so this will be very brief). I belief this will dissapear once more and more people start using bitcoin. Once market depth will increase, exchanges will improve, a smaller portion of users will daytrade and with lesser coins, etc. etc. What we're seeing right now are just growing pains.

And I like that about bitcoin.
However, I think you can decentralize the power of banking through bitcoin, while decentralizing the power of government in the old fashioned way: a constitution(/bill of rights), democracy, trias politica, etc.
This is mainly needed - I personally think - because we do need some sort of organization to take care of a whole lot of stuff. For instance, I'm dutch, and I kind of like the fact that we have dykes to keep our country from flooding.
Now, you can argue whether or not we indeed need a government to do this, but the point is: this has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's simply a whole other discussion.
Bitcoin is - if anything - about decentralizing the banking system/money supply.
If you guys want to have conversations in this sub regarding AnCap'ism or whatever that's absolutely fine, in fact, I encourage you to do so. I for one am interested in the solutions AnCap's offer for a stateless society. (I like schools, hospitals, relative safety, roads, etc. How will AnCap's deliver?)
However, it is NOT an intrinsic part of bitcoin; bitcoin could fit with plenty of other ideologies. I'm positive that a liberal, a conservative, an environmentalist, a feminist and even a marxist could all very much defend the idea behind bitcoin as well, all from their own point of view. You would probably not like to see these ideologies in the sidebar as well, though. Therefore there should simply be no ideologies in the sidebar at all.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:27:42


Well, that's kind of silly comparison since governments have all the technology that is available nowadays. If the Church had the same amount of power today as they would have had during the Middle Ages, but with todays technologies, I'm guessing the crusades would be fucking brutal. Same goes for polis, empires, and such. The drug gangs in Columbia are pretty bad, they're not recognized as a government though.
Nuances? Relative safety, schools, hospitals, roads. Internet, computers, medicin, durable energie sources, spacetravel. The American government kind of saved half a continent from fascism/totalitarianism. We have a certain level of democracy, of human rights, etc. I think shit could be much much worse.
Also, I'm pretty sure my government did not murder 270 million people. (I'm not American, in case that's what you thought?) This is kind of besides the point though.

I don't care whether people like paying taxes or not, I don't care about anyone's ideology or why they like bitcoin.
What I hate though is that a lot of libertarians and anarcho-capitalists are promoting bitcoin using their own ideology *on behalf of* the bitcoin community. This needs to stop.
If you're gonna promote bitcoin from a anarcho-capitalist or libertarian point of view, do it on your own damn account. Not on mine, nor on that of the community.
Lets start by removing the ideologies from the sidebar.

Look, I'll keep it short. I'm a pragmatist. I think a democratic republic is the best pragmatic solution for the problems posed by reality (mainly scarsity). Any time I explain why in this sub, people start telling me why a democratic republic is not perfect. The thing is, I knów this. In fact, *everybody* knows this. It's like Churchill said:
"No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."
Therefore, I've asked time and again for alternatives. Because I'm interested what they might be. I can't think of any that are better, as long as there is scarsity. Nobody seems to have any suggestions around here, though.
It's very easy to say what's wrong with the world, but it becomes completely pointless to do so if you have no solutions, no alternatives.
This is also why I'm not going to answer every question you asked. If you're truly interested in this stuff, instead of just trying to win an argument vs. a stranger on the internet, I suggest you read the political philosophies of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant and possibly the founding fathers (esp. Jefferson). More on scarsity you'll find with Adam Smith, Marx and Malthuse.
I know this is a shitload to read, so I suggest you just start with wikipedia.
Oh and I agree that a lot of representative democracies are not funtioning very well at the moment. But I think this is mainly because of corruption. It's like when your car is broken. You dont say: "Well obviously cars dont work, Ill just walk from now on." No, you get your car fixed. And in the very worst case you get a new car.

You must have spoken to the wrong ones then :(
"According to the Marxist argument for communism, the main characteristic of human life in class society is alienation; and communism is desirable because it entails the full realization of human freedom.
"In the schema of historical materialism, communism is the idea of a free society with no division or alienation, where the people are free from oppression and scarcity."
"Marxist theory holds that pure communism or full communism is a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the productive forces that leads to a superabundance of material wealth, allowing for distribution based on need and social relations based on freely associated individuals."

First, I think there is a difference between practical use and value. But yeah, the two can easily be merged, so I do not *really* disagree with your statement.
I think many of the reasons you give for the volatility are actually right. The two most important things though, I think, are;
1. Uncertainty. There has never been such a thing as Bitcoin. Nobody knows what it is right now, or what it should be worth. People are simply not sure whether or not this thing in fact has value. (The funny thing is that this is - I think - 100% a self-fulfilling prophesy.) For this thing to have value, we're gonna have to rely on each other, on mostly anonymous people on the internet. That's all there's to it. Are we, the people, gonna trust each other? This, for me, is the reason I absolutely love Bitcoin. No matter how it turns out, it's gonna teach us a shitload about human nature and society.
2. A lot of daytrading (and speculation) going on compared to people actually using the currency. And even most of those that do use it regularly instantly convert it to fiat using bitpay. At some point, people will have to use bitcoin as an actual currency. For this to happen the 'loop' needs to be closed, and - conversely - prices should be solely in bitcoin (0.25 BTC no matter what the exchange rate is, for instance). I could see this happening at some point, fueled by idealists or some place where the currency is even worse than bitcoins volatility. Probablty not any time soon though. Also, daytrading will probably die out somewhat when the skills of daytraders improve, therefore making it harder for anyone to actually make a profit of it.

I do not have the numbers for you, but you can make it as expensive or cheap as you want it to be.
The reason the elections are as expensive as they are in the US, is because it's a race to the top. (Whomever can get and spend the most money will probably win.)
No race to the top means no ridiculously expensive campaigns. (+superpacs and all that).
If you'd just have a bunch of NPR-style national debates, maybe a handful of basic advertisements each, it would cost jack. Other than that, people can just read the election manifestos. Politics was never designed to be an (expensive) idols-like entertainmentshow.

This is totally inaccurate. It is impossible to pay of our national debt *right now*, with the system we *currently* have, since *all* money is created as interest-bearing debt.
If what you say is true at all, gold could have never worked as money. Yet it did for almost all of human history, basically up until the 1970's. And some would argue that this has never *really* changed - but that is another discussion.
I also disagree with everything else you say, but I've got more important things to do right now than argue on reddit. So let me keep it short instead.
Your arguments boil down to: this is what it has been like up till now, so that is what it will and must be like tomorrow.
I, on the other hand, would argue: history has shown over and over again that even the deepest and most stable-looking systems have changed, and often quite rapidly. And I don't believe that we have reached the end of history.

Yes, it's silly. If you give evil people better technology to kill with, they will probably kill more people. That does not make them more evil. They're just as evil, just with better technolgy.
That's why governments have a higher death toll than churches. (If that's even the case - it probably is.) It's not because governments are intrinicly bad. In fact, I'd argue democratic governments are far less evil.
I don't think it's governments that do bad things. It's human beings, with or without governments. And human being will likewise organize, that's just human nature.
Since that's gonna happen anyways, I prefer democratic government. That way, they should at least act on behalve of the people, and not just on behalve of the few in charge.

If there is no absolute truth, how can your statement that all truths are relative be meaningful because that is an absolute truth in of itself? See: self-detonating statement right there.

For one, I think schools in the south of de US would still teach creationism as science if you leave it up to the willingness of parents to pay.
Moreover, I belief all people are born equal. Therefore, I think the 'accident of birth' should not play to big a part in anyones chances in life. I belief that social mobility is a good thing for any society, because it enables personal development, and the society as a whole to progress. Kids born of poor parents should therefore get the same chances in life as kids born from rich parents. Free market will not 'automaticly' enable this, because those kids with rich parents will get the best chances (best schools etc.), while kids with poor parents will get hardly any chances at all (bad schools, maybe not even any school at all.)
Ironically this 'accident of birth' argument was used by the classical liberals to defend their ideology as opposed to the rule of monarchs. Well, we're a couple of centuries later now, and I think society has developed severely, to the point where we actually might need the state to enable exactly what these liberals were fighting for.

This Libertarianism seems to be getting less and less free as we move on. Moreover, these sets of rules seem to benefit a certain fraction of society a lot more than others...

Also, there's no country in the world where the amount of money is spend on elections as it is in the US, while the turn-up is lower than in many other countries. So I don't think your reasoning is correct per se.

A lot of people who like bitcoin dislike the banking system. Not so much government. The banking system is not the same thing as government. The central bank in the USA was only implemented in the 1930's, and the gold standard let go under Nixon.
You can have a government without the current banking system. And yes, you could have a government with bitcoin, I'm sure. In fact, I'd arguable you probably will have a government, this guy explains why pretty decently:
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:57:49

The (American) government has also developed computers, durable energie sources, fantastic medicins, not to mention bridges, schools, hospitals and they've put people on the fucking moon.
It's pretty clear the government is, and has been, able to do great things. *Why* they did is not even really the point, the point is that they *can* do it. And no, I don't believe for a second all of it was with bad intentions.
I do realise governments do terrible things as well. In fact, that's kind of my point. I don't think the world is as black and white as some people seem to think (probably because black/white is easy to understand). Reality is much more grey, nuanced, than these (imo) simplistic worldviews seem to suggest.
For the rest, I completely agree with DirtyPolecat:




Well, if you could rationally explain to me why you have the right to do that, and I agree with that explanation, then yes. That is what governments have done in the past. (The rational explanation is the social contract, and in extention democratic proceedings.)

Let me guess, you're American, right? And you haven't read any of Marx' work, yeah? It's so stereotypical it's not even funny anymore.
The amazing thing to me is that you are all clearly anti-government, while at the same time you can't seem to realize it was government propaganda that demonized Marx' ideas in the US.
Marx' main ideas are very far from discredited within the (macro-economic/histrorian) academia. That doesn't prove his theories right of course, but for you to say he is 'so discredited' only shows how little you know of the subject.
Adam Smith, Karl Marx and Thomas Malthus are commonly seen as the 'founders' of the three main schools of thought regarding scarsity and economics, up until the present day. I'm willing to bet you know nothing of the latter two, which is exactly why you hold such fundamental views regarding posession.

I agree with everything you say, but this makes no sense. How is this libertarian?
The principal of equality before law comes from the Enlightenment; every modern ideology (including liberalism and socialism) adheres to this idea. What's stopping it is not ideology, what's stopping it is corruption.
If anything I'd argue Libertarianism endangers this equality. Already there are corporate prisons who bribe judges to hand out longer prison sentences, while the rich can obviously afford better and more lawyers, and sometimes even use the legal system to bully people around since money is no issue for them. And what to think of some wealthy CEO who gets a 100k fine, as compared to a blue collard worker who committed the exact same (in this case hypothetical) crime? The first will probably not even really care, while the latter will have his life ruined. How is that equality before law? I myself would argue that the justice-system is in fact one of those things in society where the free market will *not* work, since it will *not* provide equal treatment.
"As someone who seeks justice, I demand equality in prosecution!" is what I think you meant to say.

Maybe not though. Even if the community doesn't find a way do decentralize the exchanges, some day bitcoin might just be considered valueble on its own. Much like the dollar is now. Exchanges aren't necessary for the dollar to give them value, are they?

@_date: 2013-05-08 17:01:53
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain all of this stuff right now; if you want to understand the ideas, you'll have to read about it yourself.


Read about the social contract. The whole point is that you CAN enforce it based on reason; rationality.


Yes they do, because they (and their methods) both say something about (their conception of) reality. Both love and gravity are part of both reality's. Neither did Wijnberg say any of them was wrong (nor right), that's actually the whole point.
Science is based on philosophy by the way, and real scientists know they cannot discover truth. Science is not about discovering truth, it's about researching in a scientific manner. 
If you watch the whole TED-talk I think you might understand better. If not, I can't explain it any better than Wijnberg did anyways. If you do understand it, but don't agree, that's absolutely fine of course.

If you're interested in this stuff, there have been men who articulated it much better than I did, however. (And in a lot more words as well, obviosuly.) In that case I'd suggest reading (about) the political filosophies of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau en Kant; that's in chronological order. The founding fathers (esp. Jefferson) and John Stuart Mill are some of my favorites as well.
On (macro)economics and scarsity Adam Smith, Karl Marx and Malthuse are kind-of must-reads, I think. (Although especially for Malthuse it's only about understanding the concept, no need to reed whole books or anything. It's what Darwin based his theory on btw.)
It's a shitload to read of course, but there are books that compile a lot of their ideas in a relatively quick fashion. If you'd like I could give you some examples of good compilations, but I'm not at home right now and I can't remember all the titles.
Otherwise wikipedia is always a good place to start, of course.

I'm sorry to sound like a dick, but you obviously don't understand what the social contract is. Therefore, you have no idea on what grounds a state exists in the first place, hence, you have no idea what you're talking about.


Exactly. Some people say the earth is round. Doesn't make them correct either.


I don't see why not? I can debate without claiming truth.


Oh absolutely, as would every liberal by the way. I think this is the main difference between you and me. You keep pointing at the downsides of having a state, while all I see are alternatives that are even worse.
It's kind of like what Churchill said:
"No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."  
I'll read Molyneus though, I mean that. If you've got any free time you might want to look into Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant. Particularly the social contract. Just start with wikipedia; whatever. 
And if you want to get real crazy you might want to give Marx' Das Kapital a go. It's not as Hitlery as you' might have been told.

Here's where you and I disagree. You think government controls money. I think money controls government, the US government in particular.
Here's where you and I agree. Bitcoin is the solution.
This is my suggestion. We stop fighting each other over what it is we are fighting against. This is helping no one. Instead, we start fighting *for* bitcoin. You do it for whatever reason you want to do it. I will do it for my own reasons.
If you're gonna use this type of rhetoric, that is fine by me, but do it on your own behalf. Not on behalf of the bitcoin community.
Also, the ideologies must be removed from the sidebar, but unfortunately this is not something you can do anything about.

The city-state of Athens and the republic of Rome had voting systems, but we would not call such a system democratic today.
Apart from that, voting rights as we know them today where only established some two hundred years ago, although women and (in the US) slaves had to wait a bit longer.
Poverty, crime and inequality have decreased tremendously since then.
I do agree that the votingsystem within the US is basically broken at the moment.

Freedom from the power of the bankers, freedom from the capitalists, sounds very Socialist to me!
The open-source manner in which bitcoin is produced sounds very socialist to me as well.
Bitcoin provides a lot of gender equality, since everybody is free to take part - male of female. I guess it's a feminist thing!
Hell, even the pope recently denounced the current monetary system. Bitcoin is a solution for that problem, I guess it must be a Katholic type of money!
I'm none of these things myself, and I'm sure that somebody who is can come up with even better reasons why bitcoin is great. Just like libertarians can. But no ideology of religion should get to claim bitcoin. It's totally neutral, and that is the beauty of it.

I agree!


As of now I do not understand why the two can't mutually exist, much like viat and gold do now. That way we could have a real balance of power.


You're assuming bitcoin means no taxes ever anymore. I don't agree. Most taxes could still be issued, like VAT, income tax, any many others. Yes, people could potentially avoid them, just like they could avoid them right now by paying in cash. Most people won't, though.


Look up what the current wealth disparity in the world is, mate. Not in the US, in the world.


Look up what HSBC has been doing for years and years and got away with.


If they're capable of doing something like this that is the biggest prove we need bitcoin.
Yes, bitcoin has downsides. No, it won't create utopia. But given the current *global* situation, it's pretty clear to me bitcoin is a much better alternative. The losing side won't be 'most' people, like you predict. Most people will come out of this winners. The only side that will have to deal with enourmous losses are the banksters. And I think they asked for it.

It wouldn't need to be in an "I told you so" manner, it could just be funny to have a nice collection to look back on. 
It could also teach future generation to not always listen to the "experts". Much like what is happening in regard to bitcoin right now. ("They said the car wouldn't catch on either" (or: television, train, internet, etc.)) We use these comparisons to show people that the experts were not always right, so they might be wrong about bitcoin now. Future generations might compare future technology that is being disregarded by comparing it to the "experts" were disregarded bitcoin in 2013.

Why does everyone on reddit pointlessly name drop libertarianism? I know what it is. You know what it is, everyone knows what it is.
I've never believed in, or even really liked libertarianism, nor do I care to. I have used bitcoin for years, and now I can't help but feel it's been tainted by all this.
I use bitcoin for buying stuff from silkroad, invest a bit in it, and a few other odds and ends that actually save me money.
Why do redditors insist on namedropping libertarianism and even anarcho-capitalism and tarnishing the image of bitcoin.
If the libertarians changed over to the ironically named litecoin, it would help the image of bitcoin right? I doubt that will ever happen and redditors will just keep mud slinging their ideologies on bitcoin anyway without doing any research.

First of all, I would like it if you'd stop insulting me by saying I can't see past statist propaganda. I read about this kind of stuff a lot and I can think for myself. I just happen to disagree with your point of view. 


I think there's a lot less of it if you have a proper government by the people for the people installed.
More importantly though:


Ok, why not? What is morality then? Where does it come from? Who gets to decide what is moral, and what isn't? You? These are genuin questions by the way, in fact, this is exactly what the heart of the problem is, I think.

Any time soon? No. In some possible time in the future? I don't see why not.


What? No. That has only been the case for a couple of decades. Before that time people still got their dollars.


Your missing the point I'm trying to make. Just because something is a certain way NOW, doesn't mean it must remain that way forever. Point in case: it was only a couple of decades ago that all currency was based on gold. They managed to change that (quite easily.) I don't see why something like that but related to bitcoin couldn't happen some day in the future.


I agree! But likewise let's not forget the downsides that are paired with such a policy, mainly: inflation.

@_date: 2013-04-21 16:52:44


Right. And who owns the central banks? (Answer: the commercial banks.)


I understand this. I have told you this twice before now. However, if you're arguing there is absolute no downside to inflation, it's probably best to agree to disagree. Cause it seems pretty clear to me there's a downside to it.
Also, I'm seriously doubting whether a system based on everlasting growth is sustainable at all, but that's a different discussion, sort of.
Anyhow, if I understand you correctly, you think the current system is *not* rigged then? The 2008 bailout was totally legit? And if it happens again - which it will since nothing has changed at all - it will be legit again?
I agree with most of the theory you propose, BUT the current reality does not match the theory on this issue. Not anymore. The banksters at the very top of the pyramid have an incentive to take huge risks with our money, since they are to big to fail. If they fuck up, they'll just print more money. That is not the sort of inflation you're looking for; that is not the kind of inflation that stimulates anything. And this will not change at all, unless we do something about it. Bitcoin might be this 'something'.

Wow, you're one tough dude. "Welcome to bitcoin." You should write movie scripts.
I'm not gonna get into another one of these discussions, because I'm fairly certain it's a waste. You might be one of the exceptions, in which case I'm sorry, but I don't think it's worth my time discussing politics with folks who don't know the difference between the Federal Reserve system and the state, between socialism and totalitarianism, or between government and corruption. Too many of you have educated yourselves through talkshow hosts and youtube instead of actually giving the greatest minds in the history of political philosophy and economics a chance; the likes of Locke, Hobbes, Mill, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Malthus and Smith. Yes, this may seem like namedropping, but I don't care. These people have though their wholes lives about the purpose of governments and economics, and now a bunch of collegekids  on think they know it all because hurr durr DAE taxation is theft.
And you  know why these people don't give all these great men a chance? This is the worst part. Because they just want to hear whatever they want to hear. They don't care about actually exploring this stuff, they just want to have their own preconceptions explained by someone who does a better job rationalizing it than they themselves can.
This is what makes it totally pointless to get into one of these discussion.
I will say this though...


No I fucking did not. Quite the opposite really: *I don't care if they do*, just don't do it on my behalf, or on the behalf of the bitcoin community which I consider myself to be a part of. Just like a shitload of other people who don't consider themselves libertarian or anarcho-capitalist.


Probably, but none of these indicate he was a libertarian or an AnCap. That's just what you think, because you approach the issue from your own point of view. I guess you might just be one of these types who just wants to hear what he wants to hear after all...
And you know what, I'm fine with that. I'll say it again. Believe whatever you want to believe. Taxation is theft? Whatever, put all your money in bitcoin, don't pay taxes, *I don't care*.
I don't see why my position does not make any sense. If you want to promote bitcoin from whatever standpoint you wish, whatever, have fun. Seriously. *I DON'T CARE*. I'm just asking you to do it on you own behalf, not on that of the bitcoin community.
How the fuck is that in contrast of free speech? I'm not suing anybody? I'm not pointing a gun to your face telling you to stop it. I'm fucking *asking* you guys to? That's not in contrast with free speech, that *IS* free speech. 
And you're calling me a dictator for doing so? I wish you were trolling but I don't think you are. So... think about this for a second if you will. Which of these guys sounds more like a dictator to you:
1) The guy who has no power on this sub, who asks for ideological neutrality. Who asks that everyone defends bitcoin on their own behalf, and who says that no one should speak on behalf of the community - particularly regarding ideological issues.
2) The guy that has moderating powers, and is using this power to impose his own ideology on the community? Even though a clear majority does not agree?
Seriously, which of these two sounds like a dictator more than the other? Take your time...

@_date: 2013-05-06 20:08:12
I'm gonna keep this short because I have stuff to do and I'm not gonna convince you anyways. (Sorry if I sound like a dick.)
First of all, 'the government' shouldn't be some foreign entity. It should be us. The government for the people by the people. So it is in fact voluntary to pay taxes, in a democratic way.
The terms of the social contract have been discussed extensively, Thomas Hobbes' work would be a good place to start, but these ideas evolved and improved throughout the years. You can't sign it, because it's based on rationality, that's the whole point. The state basicly has the obligation to create a better place than the state of nature, the people have the obligation to pay taxes and refrain from violence, amongst others. If the state failes the people have the right to rebel, if the people fail the state has the right to use force.
Gang-rape is worse for the person being raped than the state of nature would be, so the 'rapie' would have the right to rebel. This (and thus the soveignty of the people) hold that true democracy in the way as was envisioned by Enlightement thinkers can only exist if the human rights of minority's are respected.
If you're truly interested in this sort of stuff I suggest you read about it; Hobbes, Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau, the founding fathers. I used to feel like you, but I don't anymore, these guys were pretty smart.

Number 4. Seriously. It's way way way to hard to safely and securely store your wallet right now. For me this is the single biggest issue at the moment. Since I can't figure out how to properly do this - even with wiki-guides and all that - I'm stalling my bitcoins on Bitstamp. If enough people do this - which is surely the case - the exchanges really do become like banks.
Also, a couple of years ago the fed's figured enough was enough with online poker, and decided to shut down the major sites. Full Tilt players lost all the money on their account's. Which was a lot, in some cases. Something similar is bound to happen if we do not seriously decentralize this thing.

@_date: 2013-05-10 16:15:22


I very much agree. Plus, power corrupts. I do however think we need some sort of organization. In fact, I deem this inevitable at the moment. This is why I think a democratic republic is the best option right now (or: worst option except from the others we have tried). Within a democratic republic, the power of government is limited in several ways, like the constitution (and the Bill of Rights in the US) and the trias politica. You don't have this limitation with most other forms of organization we have 'tried', like monarchies, empires, gangs, dictatorships, maffia, etc.


You could run for office yourself? 
Will you stand a chance right now? Probably not, because you don't have the money to run a campaign. If you want to get to that money you will have to get close to those who are rich and powerful already, and they won't give it to you for 'free'. That is what I think the square weels are. Take the money out of politics, and the car will probably run a lot better. Maybe it will still not be perfect, but we'll see to change the next problem when we get there.
That is what I think is the best option right now. I am however (I've said it before and I'll say it again) open to hear alternatives.

That is what you believe. I don't believe any of this. I believe that ownership and posession is just a human meme. Do you believe it's possible to own a human being? At some point in time most people did. Now hardly anybody does. Ownership is just a meme. There's nothing real about it. Therefore, I can't claim 'your' car nor house no more than I can claim 'your' 'slave', because neither you nor me can own that human being at all. Neither can you or me own that car, we can just use it, indeed just like air (you seriously claim ownership over the air you breath?).
*Same thing; I don't actually believe this. But some people do. The point is that beliefsystems clash, and do so all the time. Are you free to play your music as loud as you wish, or is your neighbour free to have a good night's sleep? Are you free to drive your monstertruck through town or are other people in that town free to use the road as well?

Although I appreciate you spelling it out for me (I mean that) I got this already.
But IMO Bitpay is not the problem here, dysfunctional exchanges are. And that's nothing new.
Are you, however, suggesting that the volatility is caused primarily or even solely because of dysfunctional exchanges? 'Cause I don't think that is the case. It might play a big part in it, but that's surely not all there's to it.


You're probably right. And I never said that it could. I said it could shield merchants from volatility. Like I said, volatility =/= dysfunctional exchanges.

If you mean by political correctness the careful-not-to-offend-anyone type of political correctness, I can assure you it has nothing to do with that.
My point is not that (all and any) ideologies should be removed from the sidebar because it is the politically correct thing to do. They should be removed because I don't think bitcoin is a libertarian instrument or anything like that. (Nor a socialist instrument, nor a fascist instrument, etc.) Sure, libertarians can *use* it as such, but they can use a gun as a libertarian instrument as well. Does that make a gun a libertarian instrument? Of course it does not. A gun is a gun. People can use it for all sorts of stuff, and have done so in the past. I think its exactly the same for bitcoin. Bitcoin is bitcoin. All types of people from all sorts of ideologies like it for all sorts of reasons.


I agree, I even applaud this. In fact, I am doing the same thing right now. (And I respect you for allowing all types of opinions on this sub by the way.)
But the question is: *why* do you think it is the correct thing to do?
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:39:23
First of all, thanks for taking this discussion seriously
You are right, when I look at the state of affairs in the US, I get very sad. I'd still prefer to live in America over Iran (dictatorship), northern Mexico (gangs) or Somalia (anarchy), but the US is not moving in the right direction. Something I hate to see happen.


They're actually making a lot of progres in dealing with this in France.


All of the candidates get the exact same amount.


The state funds it.


They have several voting rounds, like 'qualifiers' for the final. So yeah, they start with a bunch, and end with two candidates (and one winner, obviously).
I'm not french, so I might be off on one or two details. Neither am I saying that it is the perfect solution. But right now I do think that it might be a step in the right direction.

I think we could still have banks, just not the too big to fail types. There's probably several way to get there. Reinstating Glass Stegal could be one of them. However, like I said, I think a lot of politicians have become to corrupted for such a change to happen.
Bitcoin gives you the ability to be your own bank. This potentially gives us - the peope - a whole lot of leverage against this corruption.
Also, there might actually be very clever ways to circumvent banks in full. I belief Ripple has some very interesting concepts regarding trust-networks. They might work for bitcoin as well.
Plus, I suppose bitcoin would make it much much easier to start a bank yourself. Try doing that now; g'ddamn impossible.
But again: I'm not claiming bitcoin has all the answers. I am claiming the current situation is unsustainable, and we need to rethink the whole system. And that bitcoin might be just what we need to reach a breakthrough, in some or other way.

I agree that bitcoin is about more than saving pennies. But I don't think it's about dissolving government.
Here is my suggestion. We stop fighting each other over what it is we are fighting against. This is helping no one. Instead, we start fighting *for* bitcoin. You do it for whatever reason you want to do it. I will do it for my own reasons.
This holds that neither of us gets to defend bitcoin on ideological basis *on behalf of* bitcoin or the community. As long as you defend bitcoin on your own behalf, you can do it in whatever way you please. In fact, I think this is the whole point of having decentralization.
The first things that I think violates this principle are the ideologies in the sidebar of this sub.

A gun can help people empower their own lives. Does that make a gun an anarchist instrument? Of course it does not. A gun is a gun.

All types of people from all sorts of ideologies like it for all sorts of reasons.
I don't think bitcoin is political. I think that it's *you* that is political. Therefore you see how bitcoin will help *your* cause. You know what? Name an ideology, any ideology, and I'll tell you how someone that adheres to that ideology might defend bitcoin?..

Ok so in the US they're apparantly owned by regional Federal Reserves, who in turn are owned by commercial banks. Same difference. (Also: that's not a very neutral source, is it?) 


In which case we agree.


No, it was completely legal, not legit. That's something different. Who is paying those politicans that agreed on bailing out the banks? You're *almost* giving the answer yourself:


Yeah, and a lot of money to spend on campaign funding, which enables them to corrupt the political process. Legal corruption, but corruption non the less.


Agreed! I don´t see this happening though, because of the above mentioned corruption. Which is where bitcoin comes in.


Bitcoin could potentially dissolve the need to have banks at all. Therefore it shows politicians and banksters that we do NOT need them per se. That they are NOT too big to fail. And that we COULD and perhaps even might bankrupt them if they don't listen to us.
Again, I'm not propagating a bitcoin world-take over or anything like that. But I do think it would be great if we - the people - claim back our souvereignty. Bitcoin might just be the way to do this.

Yeah. Socialists hate freedom!
"The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labour from alienating work. Marxists argue that freeing the individual from the necessity of performing alienating work in order to receive goods would allow people to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labour for others."
"Marx and Engels held the view that the consciousness of those who earn a wage or salary (the working class in the broadest Marxist sense) would be moulded by their conditions of wage slavery, leading to a tendency to seek their freedom or emancipation by overthrowing ownership of the means of production by capitalists, and consequently, overthrowing the state that upheld this economic order."
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:35:33
It is though. There was a time in which humanity did have anarchy. But guess what, we organized, because it proved to be a better way to survive. And since bigger organizations turned out to be even better, they did grow bigger and bigger. Until we have got what we've got now: huge organizations termed states. With governments. It might not be perfect, but apparantly it was better than anarchism. And if we fall back tomorrow, people will start to organize all over again. Since it is indeed a better way to survive.

I think you have a misunderstanding of human nature, and the nature of reality even. Without government, I don't think it won't be peaceful and voluntary at all, because scarsity is a fact of life. Unfortunately, but true, I think. Take a look at Somalia. They don't have a government.

A lot of people would beg to differ.

This is probably gonna be a noob question, because I'm still kind of a noob concerning the technology behind bitcoin, but here it is:
If I'd have a computer, or a bunch of them, just running all day long and randomly trying to find private keys that have something on 'em, surely I'd stumble across full wallets from time to time, no? What if I'd have a botnet doing this? Just testing tons and tons of private keys on and on? Any estimates on how often I'd find something?
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:14:12
This argument doesn't cut it with the fundamentalist AnCaps and Libertarians around here, because most of them truly believe that their ideology is the one and only true ideology that is for all people and (therefore?) the only one that is compatable with bitcoin.
Pretty much sounds like the believers of any other ideology or religion (same thing imo), doesn't it? That's because it is.
Meanwhile this ideological claim on bitcoin is fucking ridiculous. It's like saying gold is inherently AnCapist or Libertarian or whatever. It's NOT. Gold is fucking gold. Shiny stuff from the ground. Just because a lot of AnCaps or Libertarians like it, doesn't make it AnCapist or Libertarian in itself. Same with bitcoin. Just because a lot of AnCaps and Libertarians like bitcoin, doesn't make bitcoin in itself AnCapist or Libertarian.
Likewise, the fact that you can defend bitcoin through a AnCap or Libertarian standpoint doesn't make any difference either. I'm absolutely sure you could defend bitcoin from literaly any other ideology as well. On different grounds, obviously, but still. Literaly any other ideology
It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:41:05

You might actually be right on the 'state' semantics, I was probably confused with a nation-state. For that I apologize.
The rest of my argument still stands, though. People will organize regardless what you want to happen, because it's human nature to do so.

Lets imagine some socialist dude would have stumbled upon bitcoin very early on. And he would have loved it, because it takes a lot of power away from these dirty capitalists at Goldman Sachs and such. Instead, he figures, we'll just all voluntarily chip in some code in this open-source project; it's the socialist dream come true!
So he would have figured: you know what, I'll make a subreddit for it! And since its the socialist dream come true, I'll include as a sort-of bitcoin community.
Then later on, other people start hearing about bitcoin. Feminists start to like it, because in an anonymous world they have exactly the same rights as men do! Libertarians start to like it, because they figure it could be a way to escape taxes! Anarchists start to like it, because it takes power away from the government. Environmentalists start to like it, because running the bitcoin protocol saves an incredible amount of wasted energy compared to the current financial system. In fact, everybody but the corrupt elite starts to like it!
Our early socialist adopter, however, does not like all of these things. He likes having a government to take care of certain things, he does not mind paying taxes, and he thinks that this could easily be done with bitcoin in the future. Hé got into bitcoin to take power away from the too-big-to-fail banks, so he thinks thát is what bitcoin is for! And even though *everybody* loves bitcoin now, he refuses to remove from the side bar. Simply because he thinks that is what bitcoin really is.
Would our socialist friend be right to do so? In a way he would, I guess. He was indeed one of the first to discover bitcoin, he was the one that made the subreddit, so he gets to decide what should be in the sidebar.
I even think we should thank our socialist friend; it's partly because of him we all know about bitcoin today.
I would wish, however, that the socialist dude would at some point realise there is nothing inherently socialist about bitcoin. And that it's perfectly cool to convince people of your socialist ideals, but that you shouldn't use someone else's invention, your status as early adopter nor your power as mod to do so.
