Hope so. Looks like I was being dumb the whole time and it wasn't DDoS attacks in the first place. I guess it's a good sign if you have so much traffic that it looks like you're being DDoS'd. *e-shrug* I held and actually bought more on the dip, so it's all gravy. I'm sure the price will rebound; it's the public confidence in btc that took the greater hit today I think.

On Mt Gox? Hopefully that works then.

As someone who believes in bitcoin, I like how enthusiastic he is, but I think a lot of people would find him to be a bit extremist, which is not the best thing when the goal is introducing something new to the general public.

Using a reddit post to ask this question is overkill. The answer is 100,000,000, but try a search first next time.

It costs money to DDOS. The less the price tanks, the less money they make, making the whole process less worth their time. This is progress.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:45:13
I do not. Just learning as I go along. Anyway, I was wrong and it wasn't DDOS's according to mt gox in the first place. So the point is moot. I was just throwing out ideas. Sorry if I've offended you.

Yes. That's why prices will eventually average out between exchanges.

It's true. I think it's a funny show, but the hive mind as a whole finds its nerd-pandering distasteful.

I meant working to stop the DDOS attacks. I might be missing something here, but it would seem that higher minimum purchase amounts means it takes much more overhead to orchestrate an attack. Just throwing ideas out there.

When a business tells me "$x will arrive in your bank account Bank of America - Bank xxxxxxx by Monday May 6, 2013", that is exactly what I expect. If they had not given me a specific date, that's one thing, but it is unprofessional to not deliver when you say you will.

I guess I meant it tries to pander to nerds, but thanks for being pedantic about it. =]

Speculation.

When there's a vulnerability, someone will exploit it. It is the nature of things. In a system with so many people, there are bound to be bad apples. You just can't expect that everyone will act honorably. The only way to stop the DDoS's is to close the vulnerability. Blaming the attackers is a victim's mentality which solves nothing. Putting pressure on MtGox to improve the system can and has, to a degree, alleviated the problem. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:57:00
Scary that someone that high up simply writes off bitcoin like that. Most reasonably intelligent people who hear about bitcoin will say "Thtat looks interesting" at the very least. He'll come around.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:39:30
'Governments are powerless to stop it'. Yeah, OK. I'm bullish on bitcoin but this seems like a foolish assumption going forward.

If tomorrow they announced that oil became twice as hard to drill overnight, would the price of oil go up or down? The perception of scarcity because of the increased mining will drive the price up if anything imho.
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:20:17
There's a difference between just expecting it to be available on a certain date and being explicitly told it will be available on a certain date, but thanks for the summary.

Just because an exchange sets up rules to prevent abuse of its services doesn't mean the market is regulated?
Edit: I also said a separate exchange could be set up for smaller transactions. Maybe these exchanges could even interface with each other to make trading more efficient, but as long as bots can put in buys/sells for .001 btc, the major exchanges can be attacked.

Convert it to litecoins, wait for gox to start exchanging ltc, then convert back to bitcoin at a more favorable exchange rate

Except people posting referral links are not 'going through the trouble' to help anyone out, they are doing so for their own personal gain by definition. If the link is worth posting, then it's worth posting as a non-referral. Introducing referral links invites spammers and people trying to game the system.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:20:05
I see your point, is it due to the fact that an increase in value of BTC attracts more miners causing the difficulty to go up?

I guess that makes sense. But I feel like even raising the minimum to 0.1 BTC would help because the cost to DDOS goes up by an order of magnitude. Am I also wrong here? Right now, it seems like this will just keep happening every few days until the price stops rebounding. Even everyone switching to a new exchange wouldn't help, because those who want to force this mass sell into a rebuy pattern can always attack whatever major exchange there is.
