Why is that hilarious? Because you're a physician? Or because you're older than me?

It can be exciting. I need to get out and live life more though so work stays enjoyable.

The best odds you can get at a casino are less than 50% just by very nature of the way casinos work. If the odds tipped higher in your favor, they'd lose money over time. Yes, I think bitcoin has more than 50% chance of increasing in value over the long term.

Age does not make wealth ;). And who's to say I'm not in a higher paying field than yours? Though physicians make a ton.

I made 70% of my net worth this year. My career is weird. I think in the next year or so, my BTC will be much less than 50% of my net worth. I'm good at saving and make weird lump sums.

Hey there. Just letting you know 100% means without a shade of doubt. As in a confirmed fact. Like, I'm 100% certain you have no idea what you're talking about.
My only debt is my car which I financed myself. Have a good income. Have not had help from my family since the age of 20.
I'm a saver, work hard for every fucking dime.

Also, that's very level headed advice and I appreciate it. Looking toward the future my next investment is real estate or investing in my career.

How old are you? Just curious...

Hmm. Interesting. I do realize this is gambling. I made an amendment to my post above.

Yeah, don't get me wrong-- it would suck to lose the money, but I've lately been trying to mentally separate that as not my money so it's not really painful to see these massive declines lately...
