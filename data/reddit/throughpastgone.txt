No and I dont inted to. When it can do that i'll be impressed. I did read somewhere that due to technical limits at full adoption each person would only be able to open and close 1 payment channel in a lifetime. (For all I know it was bullshit and i'm sure you do) i'll try to find the link

What situations are these? Because cash and cards have never failed me. I may pay a little extra for middlemen but they offer real advantages.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:17:17
I recall reading a LN article, probably exagerated i confess. But for every human to open a payment channel they could do 1nce or twice in their lifetime, pay forever and close on death i assume. (Again correction welcome)
Going to assume "bailiffs hate this guy because..." click here here for more.. was satire
You forget to mention X number of confirmations required.
Yet another reason..  if I, you, or my 70 year old grandma lose their key, they lose everything with no remittance because code is law.
Maybe using a trusted middleman to hold keys would be an answer... oh wait. These bastard middlemen ensuring our weak hands dont get decapitated
Dont want to be shot down for shilling here because i don't care, but surely if the world needed a decentralised, feeless, trustless p2p payment service (it doesnt, yet, possibly) it would be the one that begins with N and ends with O. Considering it does everything bitcoin does but better
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:27:54
Fair enough. Valid argument
 I assumed the worst so i apologise.
But as i understand it we didnt change species.
Species evolved from from a common or multiple basic single celled organisms ( no expert)and adapted in different ways to suit the environment as required. Then as animals migrated they adapted in different ways, we call these different species. 
Hence we are 98% similar in DNA to chimps but split from a common ancestor so X amount of years ago.

Mayve its because the majority of holders. Own a huge amount of coins and manipulate the market at will. 
It doesn't scale and cant scale.
A transaction takes 10 minutes.
Its completely unnecessary and current paymant systems do do the same job but 1000% faster?

@_date: 2018-04-24 23:30:19
But without banks there is no credit so your payment system is equivalent to debit card useage (but with a 1% fee)
A more knowledgeable bitcoin engager had the following to say. 
"I don't see how bitpay is maintaining that fee structure without eventually eating a loss if adoption becomes widespread. As more people use bitcoin, the mempool becomes congested and higher fees are required to be paid to the miners to have your transaction recorded to the blockchain within a reasonable amount of time. 
You're probably not the person to reply to so I'll observe the other guy's responses and pick his brain."
There were many more who queried your 3.5% to 10% figures also. 
And as you ignored my other concerns I guess we are left at this one.
For full transparency I started with a reasonable defense of bitpay as a bitcoin usecase here

Thats nothing like what I said, which was merely my starting position. I actually had some good discussions and learned a lot.
Edit: "Now if I had said because bitcoin is a pointless ponzi scheme with zero use cases and your all a bunch of fuckwits wasting huge amounts of energy to mine chuck e cheez tokens" then your post would make sense.

Not a violent state no. But a state. A smaller one preferably
You'd like everything privatised then i assume. Usually ends up more expensive.
I'm happy to pay a few taxes for services such as healthcare/bin collection/police protection/forestry management/infrastructure/immigration control/road repairs/sewer management
I could go on but you get my point, to arrange and pay for all of these things myself would be both time consuming and probably more costly.

Do you have stats on actual number of transactions, i'd argue more than now, because there's hundreds more exchanches.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:11:20
And banks are bad here right? 
With their buyer protection, deposit protection and regulations that prevent you getting generally fucked over, hacked or robbed.
Be your own bank they say. I have a bank and when i lose my card (pin/access code) i dont lose everything I own they send me a new one, free of charge.
I'd much prefer to use an access code that has to be kept in a safe deposit box to stop anybody stealing my "money" with no recourse, because code is law right
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:36:43
Whats your point. Thats a reason we have a government.
Edit for your edit. What consumer protection does bitcoin have? If I have your passphrase I can screw you over and not even the police can stop me. Because code is law. What was yours is now mine
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:10:34
Then why does everybody calculate their bitcoin worth in fiat terms? Shouldnt 1BTC=1BTC
Oh thats right its practically unspendable. Even on the darkweb.

I didnt blame anyone but myself when I lost my bank card, but it was comforting to know I could get a new one in 3 days and be reimbursed if somebody used it fraudulently.
I'm not on social media for those very reasons so i'm sorry you wasted your time writing pointless drivel. 
Its not irrelevant if you claim to have hot wallets for daily purchases. Not even the dark web is that into bitcoin these days so I hear.
I just find banks convenient and being able to spend my currency of choice everywhere very useful.

But someone finds your passphrase, transfers your coin to themselves and now it's theirs, right?
The bitcoin code is what it is, of course if you dont own bitcoin then this code is not your law. But i'm assuming you do. So in the above scenario your now penniless, correct
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:12:39
Discussions tend to drift from topic to topic and in many directions yes. 
But these are the answers i'm looking for:
How do you feel about the block size increases necessary to make LN functional? And do you know how big they will be? I assume they will solve slow confirmation &amp; transaction times as bitcoin cash did. Won't fees go to the moon when the mempool fills up again?
Why use bitcoin at all for a bitpay card. Why not just use any random tokenised (or not) blockchain ledger. I could copy paste a new one tomorrow from bitcoin
How would you intend to encourage spending of a deflationary currency? (Because I think the store of value theory has been thoroughly destroyed)
How would you propose people in unbanked countries secure their passphrases, it is a big enough issue in safe countries. And once it's gone it's gone.

@_date: 2018-04-24 20:00:29
I hope you dont mind rekindling this conversation i have some more questions (showerthoughts).
How do you feel about the block size increases necessary to make LN functional? And do you know how big they will be? I assume they will solve slow confirmation &amp; transaction times as bitcoin cash did.
Why use bitcoin at all for a bitpay card. Why not just use any random tokenised (or not) blockchain ledger. I could copy paste a new one tomorrow from bitcoin code.
Edit: I just learned credit card transaction fees in the EU are capped at 0.3%. It is retailers who add the rest. And debit card fees are almost always zero. So unless you are using a crypto bank credit card this 1% is a ripoff exchange fee.
How would you intend to encourage spending of a deflationary currency? (Because I think the store of value theory has been thoroughly destroyed)
How would you propose people in unbanked countries secure their passphrases, it is a big enough issue in safe countries. And once it's gone it's gone.

You think btc wasn't premined when a tiny number of people control majority supply. Bought or not they control the market. Even without tether *printing*. I beieve nano to be more evenly distributed.

Visa can handle 24,000 transactions per second. Then there's cash transactions.
I dont beieve bitcoin can ever scale that high. Plus with all the unbanked who will adopt it will require even more.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:31:39
Better government regulations would go a long way to solving issues such as irresponsible lending. Inflation is necessary to encourage people to spend and not hoard, a la bitcoin.
I dont disagree banks can be complete shits but they also do a lot of good that couldn't be achieved without them
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:29:17
You dont think we require any government? No-one to manage our councils, repair roads organise the police, fire services and army.
Banks do require regulations and who is going to do it? Self regulation is the worst scenario i can imagine for banks. There would be no deposit protection if the government hadn't forced it.
But in unregulated uncontrolled banks i'm sure exit scams would be common is what i'm saying. Why wait for their measly few% interest when they can empty the vault and leave town.

First there are consumer fees for buying bitcoin and then retailer fees for converting back to fiat.
