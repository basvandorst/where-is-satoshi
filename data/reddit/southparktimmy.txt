You mean that agreement between miners and corporations, which excluded the bitcoin community, users, and developers?

Why not open an account on Kraken? They have btc/Euro pair and all you need is a passport.

It all depends on your tax residency. What country are you in?

You're are so wrong. Seqwit happened because of UASF, don't rewrite history. There was no compromise made...Core was not even invited to the NYA.

This is one of the best and simplest explanations what bitcoin is that I have seen:

I am in the same boat. There is no telling what the whales manipulating the BHC price are going to do. At the moment, I am going to sit on my hands and do nothing. It’s possible I may become a bag holder of BHC if the whales decide to pull the rug from under me, but I just consider it an insurance policy to see how this will all play out.

What? Your order would execute at the highest market price even if you put in a limit price of .005.

Sit tight. You will be fine. If you look at the price daily, you are going to stroke out. Just go away for a year, and when you come back you’ll be pleasantly surprised.

I am glad I am not the only one that is thinking this. Well said.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:33:38
Why don’t you explain why you think it will not go up instead of preaching your whatever advice you are giving? I would like to hear it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:01:09
Maybe, maybe not...depends where you live.

Oh noes...800 billion? The Fed has already pumped 325 billion to calm the repo markets since October this year.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:33:17
That I have no doubt.

Yes she would be liable for taxes/gains made in her account. Personally, I would setup an account in your name on Kraken...that is no problem as aUK citizen. What is the problem with setting up an account in your name?

Laugh all you want, but so far you have said absolutely nothing as to why you think we are in s bubble, except....just because. You sound pretty young. As far as a big crash, you obviously have not been in the crypto game for that long. There's been already been 3 "crashes" of 30% or more on bitcoin this year alone...and here we are at $4500. I think it's you that is delusional and needs to get better educated 
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:56:00
With posts like this, i believe users should do a crash course on how to read stock charts. This drop is not unexpected.
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:01:25
I wondering if you would have said the same thing in 1995 when the internet was first starting out.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:55:21
The chart says it all. I believe we're heading to low 3k and then we go up from there.
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:54:11
RemindMe! 3 months Lets see the crash.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:22:37
If that's not the most positive comment for Bitcoin coming from the establishment, then I don't know what is.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:13:16
I suggest going to TradingView.com and just read the bitcoin charts from the different people posting. This will give you an idea of the market is heading from a technical perspective. Furthermore it may give you some perspective when to enter and exit the market.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:42:14
I used only a passport for Kraken
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:54:19
Oh man, this makes me sick to my stomach reading this. Horrible.
