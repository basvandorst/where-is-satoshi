its Tech in its infancy. The more people grasp the innovation the less volatile it will get! Patience young padawan :) Please feel free to ask me any questions if you should have some :)

If my sense of humor is not appealing to you, I am truly sorry. Could you please elaborate what kind of humorous post about an obviously misinformed individual like Matthew Driver would have been appropriate? 
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:30:37
This is so awesome. Thanks man.

IMHO the auction is a non-issue. It is simply used by whales to steer the market in the preferred direction. Regarding the price: It would make sense to suppose that the coins will be sold for a slight premium since we saw exactly that happen the last time around. Buying a bunch without slippage would still be cheap if you add a small premium on top of it. Buying that amount on exchange would push the price upwards significantly, so paying a premium on exchange prices is still a bargain.

Man I just realized that I got more bitcoin (via changetip) from you guys today than my small rPi Miner (which is obviously only running for the fun of it) made in the last 3 months. Thanks alot internet strangers and damn you all for disrespecting my mini miner! :D
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:44:07
I bow to your eloquent elaboration. This is the spirit we need here and I thank you for the perspective. 100 bits

@_date: 2014-11-13 07:16:21
you must be new to bitcoin. Go do your homework and watch the NYDFS hearing and see Dr. Bitcorn in action. Here is a link for your convenience:

only for you. here you go 
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:50:50
using a bank like service to obtain bitcoin and paying a fee for this service doesn't mean that bitcoin is the reason for the fee isn't it? 
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:49:07
woot :D

Well, if SPON decides to publish a positive Article about Bitcoin, we must have reached mainstream. paging @_date: 2015-03-06 08:30:51
Germany doesn't have alot of BTC spots aswell... Berlin is the only place where you would be able to survive on BTC. Even the financial capital of Germany, Frankfurt, doesn't have alot to offer for BTC enthusiasts. 
Last but not least you could try and use the food delivery service: lieferservice.de -&gt; they do take BTC. Have Fun and enjoy your trip to EU :)

IMHO Banks could play a role in the Bitcoin Universe by providing services for average Joe like escrow services, traditional currency exchange and Insurance. Maybe even offering insured storages for your bitcoin savings? The potential is quite huge there, but all these use cases are rather short sighted. If bitcoin succeeds and becomes globally accepted, people all around would recognize the benefits of decentralization. Banks could play a role in providing "colored coin" solutions though. Administration of smart contracts and such. Another benefit would be the use of the existing infrastructure that the banks have established (ATMs and POS Systems). Interesting times ahead of us I suppose :)
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:56:46
I read the comments because you mentioned it. Damn you ;)
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:06:15
Well that is one optimistic outlook for 2016. 10k before the halving seems a bit too eager I suppose. I do share your optimism but I try to keep it realistic as well. Babysteps ;) Lets crack the ATH first get rid of this uber bearish sentiment.
