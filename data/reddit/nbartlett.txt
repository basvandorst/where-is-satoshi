... a password that I can never actually remember, because the Verified by Visa window pops up *just* often enough to be intensely annoying but not quite often enough that I can remember from last time. Oh and because my password must have upper and lower case and numbers and special characters and at least one farmyard animal, and must not be the similar to the last password I used.
But hey at least I can get around it by clicking "forgotten password" and filling in my date of birth and mother's maiden name -- which are both available to anybody as a matter of record -- and three digits from the back of the card, which I already supplied in the order form! All of which proves the process is completely and utterly **FUCKING POINTLESS**.
And when I try to take VbV off my card, my bank tell me that it isn't allowed. Like the Mafia, once you're in you can never leave. Fortunately I still have one card that I have managed to keep out of VbV... so far!
So yeah, maybe this isn't enough *on its own* to convince people to adopt bitcoin. It's just another of those cumulative little things where mainstream life pisses people off and makes them wonder if there isn't a better way.

Since the utopia of universal bitcoin acceptance does not currently exist, it's useful to consider ways to increase its adoption. Remittances is one such way, and it requires conversion to local fiat.

Off-chain transactions within a single wallet service are trivial and uninteresting. Not everybody uses Coinbase, or any one particular wallet service, nor to we want to encourage everybody to centralise on a single service.
The contracts-based micro-transactions implemented by BitcoinJ are much more interesting, because they can be implemented by any client, and can therefore work across different wallet sites and even privately hosted wallets.

+1 for Bitstamp, they're excellent.
One small annoyance though. Trading on the site is all in USD but SEPA payments are in EUR. Not so bad if you live in a Eurozone country, but if you're outside the zone (e.g. the UK) then you pay a double conversion, first to EUR then USD.
I believe that most Bitstamp customers are European, so I wish they would use EUR as their principal fiat currency.

Go to localbitcoins.com (LBC), find a UK seller who will trade online. Initiate the deal, and LBC will lock the seller's bitcoins in escrow. Now it's safe for you to send a payment using your online banking... most UK high street banks use the Faster Payment Service, so the money will arrive in the seller's account pretty much immediately. He/she can then release the escrow, and voila, you are the proud owner of a shiny virtual pile of bitcoins.
Just be sure to check the ratings and feedback of the seller.

Yes it's invalid to lump people into groups... but the report doesn't do that. It doesn't say that *all* rich people are assholes and *all* poor people are kind. However it does say something that is completely measurable and objective: that rich people are statistically more likely to exhibit selfish behaviour.
That is something we should definitely give a more than just a flying fuck about.
I'm sure you could quibble over the methodology... for example, it's important to know what kind of controls were used to avoid the researchers own biases from influencing the result. But you're not bothered with that, you just misrepresent the result to make it trivial to knock down. Classic straw man fallacy.

Nothing really stopping you from doing this, but you probably wouldn't make anywhere near as much money as you think.
People have been doing this with stock markets for decades; it's called arbitrage. However none of the bitcoin exchanges so far have anything like the depth and liquidity of a modern stock market, so a lot of the time your orders will not execute at all, or will execute at a much smaller volume than you expected.
Nevertheless, I'd be very happy to see somebody prove me wrong.

No, you go to a Bureau de Change like Travelex. They quote a price and you pay with your credit card, done in 30 seconds. Don't tell me debit cards are impossible due to chargebacks; TransferWise allows you to fund irreversible bank transfers with a debit card so why not BTC purchases?

Right, all sorts of currencies are still successful without having the status of the USD as the global reserve currency and *de facto* trading currency.
The Swiss franc is a good example... even though Switzerland is tiny and therefore the tax argument is much weaker, the CHF is still valued and even widely used for transactions outside of Switzerland.

The Lamassu ATM as presently designed is not sufficient. It takes in fiat notes but does not dispense them.

Why bother transferring directly between the two? Just hold a balance at both sites. When you see a price gap, buy at one site and sell at the other site at the same instant.
This is known as arbitrage and when done correctly it is risk-free. However with current Bitcoin exchanges (particularly Mt Gox) it's unlikely you'll be able to achieve true arbitrage due to the lag in processing orders... or even the possibility that one side of your order will fail, leaving you with a lopsided trade and lots more risk than you expected.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:05:46
This implies you keep two balances; one in BTC and another in a conventional currency, I'll assume USD, meaning you prefer to spend the USD because it is flat whereas the BTC is growing. But why would you keep any balance in USD?
Fair enough, you probably receive your pay in USD and pay for most things with USD. However if you believe that BTC is going to continue to climb, then the most rational strategy is to convert all your pay to BTC immediately after you receive it, and then convert small amounts back to USD for purchases that cannot be made in BTC. In this case you prefer paying directly in BTC because it avoids the conversion overhead.

Terribly misleading. The "60% more expensive" claim is if you buy bitcoins with pesos, and report the transaction using the official dollar exchange rate for pesos.
But this is clearly bullshit because nobody can actually obtain the official exchange rate... it's a fiction! So of course nobody wants to sell bitcoins for pesos at that rate. They trade at the black market rate, the *real* rate, which happens to be (guess what) 60% higher than the official one.

It seems from other responses that the answer is no. I agree... but that's just credit cards! What about **debit** card transactions, or EFTPOS as they seem to be called in Australia and Canada?
I'm in the UK and I used to use TransferWise to purchase bitcoin from BitStamp (until they blocked it... grumble grumble). Anyway, TransferWise do support payments with debit card to authorise international transfers, which are obviously non-reversible. That leads me to believe that they have found a way to rule out chargebacks on debit card transactions, or at least make the risk so small that they can eat it when it happens.
If this can be made to work, then it could be a really handy way to buy bitcoins in many countries, since debit cards are just as convenient to use as credit cards.

When I bought from Amagi Metals, the checkout was based on BitPay, which I believe means that Amagi don't even handle the bitcoins directly, they are converted to dollars by BitPay. Which makes this decision by the bank all the more moronic and baffling.
I hope Amagi get this sorted out. Their service was first class and they are an incredibly valuable part of the bitcoin ecosystem.

Surely this is a good thing? The investors in a venture are exactly the people who should bear the costs when that venture fails or loses money.
This is the opposite of what happened in Cyprus. There's a big difference between investors and depositors.

I don't think it's a valid comparison. Japanese people are perfectly accustomed to 100 yen being a piffling amount of money.
The same is not true of a typical American's attitude towards a $100 bill. Nor should it be.

It doesn't matter whether they're considered money. Stocks are not money either, but a gain on the stock market is certainly subject to CGT.
Saying that you gambled away the money might work, but it's still tax evasion.

European governments are starting to attack this route as well by restricting the legal size of cash transactions. For example in Italy the maximum size of a cash transaction is €1000, and France is following suit.
It's all in the name of fighting tax evasion and money laundering, but the end game will be the total elimination of cash itself, which governments hope will be replaced with 100% centralised and traceable electronic payments. They will be most displeased to see Bitcoin take over instead!
Hopefully at a certain point in the future, ability to convert BTC to local currencies will be irrelevant, once enough goods and services can be traded directly in BTC. I find it ironic that governments are hastening this future by directly attacking their own fiat currency instruments.

Sounds like a very fair and reasonable decision from LBC. Buyer provided evidence to back up his claim, seller refused to, so there's really only one way this could have gone. 
Well done Localbitcoins!

Okay I'll grant that (since I have no way to dispute it).
The 4 days for new users is still a problem, no matter now well it is telegraphed. It kills the possibility of a newbie seeing a link that says "pay with bitcoin" and saying, oh that's interesting I'll give that a quick try.
What is the reason for the 4 days anyway? Is it AML checks on the coinbase side, or is it just how long a wire transfer takes in the US?

I'm sure that those sites that publish a canary do so with the best of intentions. The problem is, priorities may change drastically when the dreaded subpoena actually arrives.
I'm not saying this has ever happened, but then again it's pretty much impossible to tell if it ever has.

Stupid question in the first paragraph: "Why does Bitcoin attract [Ponzi] scams like this"? Because it IS money, of course. Because it DOES have value, otherwise why on Earth would the scammers bother?
You might as well ask, why do dollars attract so many scams? This feels too obvious to explain, yet apparently it still needs to be explained.
The Madoff scam was four *thousand* times the size of the recent "pirateat40" scam and had absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin. Maybe there's a problem with the social infrastructure around dollars...?

Not much, but then you can't buy much with 50 cents either.
I honestly don't get the point you are trying to make. You say that the price of a whole bitcoin is too high at $30.... fine, so you want to invest less than $30, nothing wrong with that. So I pointed out that you *can* easily invest less than $30 because coins are highly divisible (in fact much more divisible than most national currencies including USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, JPY). Then you say, well what's the point because you can't buy anything with 50 cents worth of BTC. You can't have it both ways!
Fractional amounts of BTC are still useful and have purchasing power. For example just yesterday I bought a domain name for less than half a BTC.
Parity with the dollar is a purely psychological hangup and you should try to get over it. It might help to just convert prices to milli-BTC, i.e. you can get around 33 mBTC for your dollar.

I wonder if this move is supported by the Republicans. You know, the party of State's Rights and shrinking the role of federal government agencies.

Gold *can* go higher if fiat currencies fall. So it's more of a hedge against inflation than something you hope to make you rich. It's also a good hedge against Bitcoin crashing and burning, e.g. through a successful attack by governments.
So it has a place in the portfolio certainly, though I would personally put a greater proportion into Bitcoin.

Still don't see what this has to do with the thread.
You took the very tenuous connection that Bex.io uses a language that is based on another language that was designed about 20 years ago by an Ericsson engineer, and went off on a complete tangent.

"some sort of P2P exchange mechanism where people around the world are trying to get in and out of various currencies and do free transactions for each other"
Sounds like the hawala system, which has existed for centuries. The main problem is that it requires a high degree of trust, and so is usually based on family or tribal connections.
Bitcoin could potentially remove the some of the trust issues. You could send a code to your cousin in Mexico which he can take to his local bitcoin agent; the code unlocks a transaction which pays to the agent and he shells out the cash (after taking his fee). Obviously I haven't thought this through in detail yet...
@_date: 2013-03-15 16:58:03
My biggest question about this is how they are accounting for tax. I imagine that the BTC payments need to be declared as part of the employee's income, probably as "payment-in-kind". However I know nothing about Finnish tax law.

It's true that Bitcoin can replace many of the functions of SWIFT. However, banks already use SWIFT and they have mature and well tested systems that integrate with it. Also SWIFT transactions can carry much more supplemental data with a transaction than just the monetary amount.

It's not an API restriction. When you send your application for review by Apple, they reject it as a matter of policy if it includes features for transacting virtual currencies.

It's not *that* easy, especially for business owners without technical skills. You have to handle stuff like:
- Generating receive addresses for each customer;
- Displaying the address to the customer in a useful format, e.g. QR code;
- Listening to the bitcoin network for incoming payments having the right number of confirmations;
- Correlating those incoming payments with the customer's order;
- etc.
None of this is rocket science of course, but if you can get somebody to do it for you (for a small fee) then that makes perfect sense.

Forget about 20 years in the future, let's imagine this disaster happening *right now*. How would you get by? Your credit and debit cards are useless, and you can't get any cash from the ATMs, so how much cash do you have in your wallet at the moment? Almost certainly not enough to live on for more than a few days.
So will society crumble? Of course not. What will happen is that people will help people. You will borrow what you need from your neighbours, and lend them what they need. Barter and informal credit will take over, just like they have in the past.
As for the imagined scenario, I think that in 20 years time the internet will be such a vital utility that outages of any significant length will be unheard-of. Things are already heading this way: I cannot be a fully functioning citizen in my country *today* without internet access, as there are forms to fill and taxes to pay that can only be completed online.

Great story. Doesn't seem to be fraud since the bank had ample opportunity to read the contract before signing it.
I suppose they could get him for copyright infringement? Since he produced a derivative work (the new contract) without their permission.

"Social Networking" should not be on this list. Just switching to a different service doesn't make any of your information less public.
If you're security conscious you either don't use SN at all, or you use it extremely cautiously in the knowledge that anything you write can be seen by anybody at any future time and used against you.

Yes but unfortunately this creates an incentive for everybody to centralise on a very small number of wallet services.
@_date: 2013-07-24 08:17:49
A more obvious question about warrant canaries is, why would the service provider ever "trip the signal" by failing to update the canary? They cannot warn specific customers, so doing this would effectively tell the world "stop using our service". It's commercial suicide.
Better for consumers, surely, to use a service that is outside of jurisdictions where such subpoenas can be enforced.
