Doesn't it though? If I buy something with bitcoin then I am simply buying it in a fiat currency converted to bitcoin at the time of purchase in most cases.  It's not like this costs 0.5 BTC.  Companies vary the BTC price to match the exchange rate.  Bitcoin losing half it's value means I'm paying twice as much bitcoin for the same purchase.  Since you bought BTC with a fiat currency (everyone did, even miners), then you are now paying more for that good then you did when the value was higher.
Unless I'm missing something fundamental here.
Same thing is happening in Canada as our dollar drops relative to the US.  Imports are costing more money since they are paid for in USD generally, then we convert to CAD.

The person they were replying to said they'd keep the revenue in BTC.

I guess the issue is that you can perform  easily with face-to-face transactions, but when you don't know the other party you want somebody you can trust in the middle.  Currently banks are it.  You'd never trust some random BTC company that's been around for a couple years with no oversight more than a bank.  And har har you don't trust banks.  But yes... you do.  Unless you keep all your money under your mattress, you trust banks to hold your cash and to identify the worthiness of a financial transaction.

The fact you have to say "almost"...

although other exchanges have lost value in the past few weeks.

"We shouldn't focus on the price" -- literally the only point of money is to trade one thing of value for another thing of value.  The one, single, only, purpose.  Therefore, the "value" is rather important considering that nearly everything else's value is currently measured as a relative value next to USD or another currency.

Bitcoin is already highly regulated.  There are *a lot* of rules for making it work.
Maybe you're just afraid of *government* regulation.
