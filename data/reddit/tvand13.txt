This is insane thinking. The whole point of a permissionless currency is to be able to transfer whatever amount you want, whenever you want. Who the fuck are you to know what this guy "needs"?

Lol I don't think a guy with one full node and a pruned node on normal computers with a residential internet connection counts as "all of the nodes controlled by only a few people".

There's also the possibility that many of the nodes up right now might not be the same nodes from before that came back online. Many of them could be brand new nodes. People that were on the fence about starting a BU node before might have decided to if they believe it was Core that attacked all of the nodes.

They don't raise the node count. They're all coming from the same IP.

Again, what is "instantly"? It looks like most came back on over the course of a few hours. I think it's plausible to think that was natural.

I have two nodes actually, for similar reasons as ericools' comment below.

What is "nearly instantly" though? It looks like most came back on over the course of a few hours. I think it's plausible to think that was natural.

I'm not sure about that; I only run a few Unlimited nodes but I was back up and running a couple minutes after the hotfix. I think it also may have to do with the fact that many Core users are running core by default, and they're not very active or aware. People running Unlimited are obviously doing so on purpose, and they may be more likely to stay on top of the news.

That's exactly what they do. They go to all the mechanics.

Hey IRS officer, I haven't gotten my refund check back yet, could you look into that?
