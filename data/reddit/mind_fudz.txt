This is a bad line of thinking if you actually care about the environment. This is clearly being written to score points for a political position. Both contribute. And one being less than another doesn't excuse either if you think emissions from electric plants are a real problem as such.

It's worth noting that my brd wallet address is 42 characters long, while the address for cashapp is only 34. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Is there some technical thing I'm unaware of or did cashapp just suddenly change something?

Not stuck, just new. As a noob it's kinda overwhelming to google around for good and up to date information, so thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:53:07
does anyone actually need to explain bitcoin to their grandparents?
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:00:59
Have both a bitcoin and a fiat price if you really just wanna sell it. Bitcoin only if you wanna stand out. Art is incredibly hard to monetize as it is.
