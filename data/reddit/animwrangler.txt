This is called day trading. Many people try to do it most aren't succesful for very long.


No mechanics are stopping, but it's up to the whims of the market. What happens when you hit the sell order, but it doesn't come back down to the the point where you gain coins on the buy order? You're either holding cash or you're going to buy in thus resulting in fewer coins than if you hodled.


Every time you sell (or exchange for something else), it is a taxable event. If you sell for a larger price,  you owe capital gains. Short term gains are taxed as regular income.

Tell me, when is the last time it's been under $4000 let alone sub $1000? There's no guarantee that bitcoin markets will respect your price point at which you will be profitable. What happens if you sell but then 10 minutes later the price jumps? Your options are to buy back in less that which you hodl-ed and try to time the next dip correct or continue waiting. Playing the waiting game is how people miss out on bull runs.

Yes. Capital gains are assed any time property that has gained value is exchanged for other property. First in first out if you're only exchanging a part of your btc holdings. Realistically though the IRS isn't going to care about a hundred dollars in gains. A few thousand? Yeah, they'll care then.

Yes. Roth 401ks are newer and it depends on the company if they allow roth; I've had it both ways, but the traditional 401k is pretty much everywhere now hence why I used "typical". Also, any employer match will not be Roth. One tiny correction, though, is that through a traditional 401k (and IRA), is that once money is taken out, it is taxed as income not capital gains (doesn't matter if it's the principal or not).
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:57


Typically, yes for short term (assets held less than a year), if held longer for a year before selling they are taxed separately. Some rules might have different taxable percentages based on the type of income (a salaried job vs self-employment), in those cases this income is more along the lines of self employment income.
It may not move the needle on a tax bracket, but I would never advise to not report it especially with the attention bitcoin is getting.
But taxation aside, assuming you can pull it off consistently is very different that thinking you can, especially if you don't know what kind of trader you are. Will you be content to miss out on a rally because you sold for a profit, or will you get back in at a higher price? Again, most people have some success but all it takes is one bad trade to ruin the hundreds of others that were profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:51:34
No, the only reason it goes up is supply and demand. Fewer transactions going through is  means those that still buy are going to buy high and a lot to make sure that the fees to get it pushed to the top are a miniscule percentage.

If the fork makes enough waves, the hardware wallets will support it. For example, I got a mirror bch balance on my trezor. If it doesn't make enough waves that means only a sizable portion of BTC would be worth anything which is far too dangerous to leave on an exchange.

Coinbase has a platform under it's ownership unbrella called GDAX. It still takes time to get money from your bank account to a USD wallet on GDAX, but once it's there you can buy and sell instantly (there may or may not be fees). It also takes time for if you wish to withdrawal into your bank account.
But again I'd highly recommend to not do this because you are at the whim of the market. You may sell for a profit but instead of going lower it goes higher, so if you get in again you now have less BTC than if you just held onto them. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:29:15
You see, you're failing into the trap of false confidence that most traders who eventually lose their shirt fall victim to. Remember, past success doesn't guarantee future success.
So apparently you doubled your money (congrats btw) on one of the hottest bull market runs in the history of the S&amp;P. You also made $150 or perhaps $125 on a 300 or 350 investment (you posts a minute apart contain different numbers to forgive me if I don't really trust your credibility). If it's so predictable, why didn't you make more? BTC is up almost 16% since a week ago including the dips. Someone who simply bought the dip via dollar cost averaging and hodled could just as easily be in the exact same position as you, not to mention without owing any capital gains.
You seem a bit niave if you think that just because you've had a good year in the markets and a good week day trading BTC that you'll be indestructible and it will be very easy. That's not really a sign of a good trader.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:12:23
Coinbase although it has buying and selling features is not designed as a trading platform. GDAX is designed as a trading platform and as such has different restrictions from Coinbase even though they share the authentication and identity confirmation protocols. Coinbase is designed to make it relatively easy to buy Bitcoin through various means even via credit cards which would give you Bitcoin instantly with waiting to transfer to a USD wallet (if you go through the authorization process) but at the cost of higher fees. GDAX lowers the fees...some trades may have no fees, but it gates how you get USD into it's system.

Multiple exchanges and getting approvals for the highest withdrawal limit. GDAX does have an application form to increase it. If you have a multi-million dollar transaction, then you're going to have to start ringing up customer support on various exchanges and see if you can work out a deal.

Although I can quip that no real day trader has said such a statement, you may end up in pickle here. Assuming you're in the US, short term capital gains do not qualify any specific exemptions based on your tax bracket (capital gains on assets held longer than a year absolutely do). Short term capital gains are taxed as income. Realistically, the IRS isn't going to audit you over $150 in unreported income especially at such a low level of total income and at most it would drop what you'd get back in a rebate come tax time by a couple of bucks, but I'd highly suggest you do more research so you either don't end up losing your shirt and/or get a happy visit from the tax man later down the road.
This just reinforces the point that you are indeed naive.

In hindsight the best time to buy was 2011. The second best time is now. As stated in numerous places here. Don't purchase more than you care to lose. If you're so inclined, I'd do dollar cost averaging buying (buy an amount every month or quarter regardless of price.

Again, personally, I'd much rather lower my contribution (while still maintaining employer match) than pull from the 401k. But, since you're not expecting the gains to payback the loan, I guess the next thing to wrestle with is if the loan payments won't impact your life, there's not much of a reason why you can't forego the loan (or simply lessen it) and invest via dollar cost averaging over time.
If you do go ahead with the loan, you'd have to ok with the fact that bitcoin could tank and take your single large investment with it. A hedge against it is to spread out the investment over a few months or a year, but at that point you'd be paying interest on the loan where it sounds like you could budget it from your earnings.
Again, your call. If I were to do something like this, I'd probably take what I'd planned as an initial loan, halve it and invest the halved loan as the initial seed and let my post tax earned income make up the second half over 6 months.

Based on your post history, you have at least some sort of traditional trading experience and have some key financial literacy. You also may know more about your tendencies as a trader which is super tough to learn and not end up regretting it in such a historically volitile market like btc. You may like at and may have made money in the past, but for everyone that's made a buck or two day trading there's a score of people who lose their shirt or came out worse than if they just hodled.

Although I wouldn't do it, I think the main thing to focus on is how you're going to pay back the loan. Expecting to payback the loan from bitcoin gainz is a fool's errand (besides you should be hodling). If you can pay back the loan in fiat while maintaining the life for your wife and child as well as without draining your emergency fund to the point where you put your wife and child at significant risk if you were to lose the job, then you can go for it if you feel comfortable.
If you have a roth IRA, that might be a better play because you can take out the principal penalty free.

Who the flying fuck is your audience if they already know basics of investing and should infact not need any advice from you? Who is your post for?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:02:18
Yes. At that point its a numbers game based on interest of the loan. The more you take out, the more you have to pay back and the more interest you accrue. If that money is just sitting there for a few months, you may have not needed to take out that much and instead could just using savings from your post-tax income.
Do the math and reconcile the risk. Determine how much you want invested by the end of the 6 month period, and then break down how much should come from the loan and how much should come from your normal gross income, for example the first 4 months can come from the loan, but the last 2 month can come from saved income thus you only need to take out a loan for 2/3 of the investment.

There are bitcoin savings accounts, but I can't imagine that they'll be able to keep up and obviously aren't FDIC insured (if you're American).

10% at 11k is $1100...
As being said multiple times day trading is the quickest way to lose your shirt and come out worse off than if you hodl-ed. You'll hit some dips right and you'll miss some dips. Not to mention that every time you sell for fiat or even trade for another crypto you are liable for short-term capital gains; rules may vary by region but short term gains are taxed at **income** levels.
Bitcoin is very volatile and it's very hard to predict when a dip will happen or how deep the dip will dive or how quickly it will recover. You can certainly react to a dip, but that's a gamble in itself.

The hedge against this is dollar cost averaging buying, though. Get the loan stuff it high interest savings and buy over the course of several months/a year. It may dampen your gainz, though, but it will open opportunities to buy cheaper should a correction happen.
Or a combination of a smaller loan for the initial investment plus dollar cost average buying using the money you'd be paying back the loan with.

Most use FIFO (first in first out), but there are several others. As long as you stick with a consistent cost basis throughout reporting.


Using FIFO, you start with the earliest coins you bought. Let's say for simplicity sake you doubled your money by the end, and now you want to take out half. That would mean the gains would be the sum of the difference between the buying and selling point for the first 6 buys.
All fees must be included. It was btc exchanged for something and  therefore subject to any capital gains (or losses). Easiest thing to do is simply tack the fee onto the price.
If you're having trouble, try something like bitcoin.tax. But really all you need is a good spreadsheet and simply enter the numbers.

But by not even covering it is in fact income you're giving the false impression that nothing changed and they have their money back now with free BTC, which is incorrect. They'd have their money back - 15-30% ballpark for self-employment income taxes. I wouldn't make a big stink about it if you stated that you can pull out your initial investment if you wanted but the simple fact that you are explictly telling people who don't know shit from shit to do means that you are infact dispensing incomplete and potentially damaging advice.
The people who are struggling to enter BTC now will be exactly the kind of people who need to be hand held when it comes to dealing with anything more than ploping in their W2 to turbo tax.

To think that people actually kept written spreadsheets and checkbook logs before the Internet happened. Seriously, it's not that hard to notate what you buy and how much you spent on it. It's basic financial literacy and budgeting.
Hell, many exchanges and places like coinbase keep your histories. There are also many historical tools to look up the daily average price of bitcoin (you don't explicitly need the minute by minute exchange rate).

Just using Nicehash as an example if you're currently mining, they  allow you to transfer your btc to an external once you hit .01 btc. Thus that is their payment threshold, so every time you see a "payment" in btc from Nicehash to your independent wallet is the equivalent to getting a paycheck from a freelance gig, and you don't need to count the btc that is on their platform and still restricted. So, your income from mining should be the tally of those payments at the fiat price when they're earned. This, of course, only applies if you earned these coins from mining this year. If your mined coins are far older, then you can skip this.
 Now if you want to sell some of that btc you mined regardless of when they mined, you would also need to take note of any capital gains (or losses) since you received the coins. Basically fiat price when coins are exchanged for fiat - the fiat price when coins were received. First in; first out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:01:43
Capital gains is assessed any time you exchange your BTC for something else. Doesn't have to be just for USD. If you bought an alt from BTC you'd owe capital gains if there are any.
You also have to use a consistent cost basis. FIFO is probably the most common (first in first out) and that applies to all BTC holdings

1) Technically speaking you need to report *any* amount.
2) Yes. If the asset is held less than a year it will be taxed as income. If held longer than a year you're typically look at 10-20%, although if you earn below a certain threshold (I think it was 37k in 2016), then you may not owe capital gains taxes.

Technically speaking short term capital loses are used to balance out any capital gains, and if you have a net capital loss you can deduct from other types of income. Likely at your income level it wouldn't move the meter much if it all.
Personally, I'd report it, especially if you file taxes and aren't a dependant. Best case, you'd get an extra buck or two from your tax return, and worst case you spend an hour or so of your time typing things into TurboTax for just the experience.

This is the first time you've mentioned a pay service. If that's the case, why not just hire a personal accountant/money-manager and be done with it?
It seems like you've never worked a call center. Most times different numbers are actually routed into the same queue, as the different toll-free numbers are used to separate clients or based on contracts. The reality is that the same people that you call when it's broke initially will be the same people you can to act as a gatekeeper. Clogging the lines also valid because you have a central source acting as a gatekeeper for all clients. Take a call center job before you work on this idea more; it's obvious you need the education.

How can I obviously chose something that doesn't exist? Also, all call centers blow chunks; it's not the best customer service..simply the most economical for the provider. 
It's simply not economical to use this in any fashion other than a massive storage for rare and large scale transactions. In that case I'd trust the security of multiple safety deposit boxes with 'luxury' banks over some sort of call center that holds 1 key permanently.

You then run into the problem I first pointed out, keeping TWO very important keys in very close proximity to each other to do anything with your money within a reasonable amount of time (which seems like what you're suggesting due to giving the example of moving money over for a 'night on the town'). Just storing the multiple keys or multiple copies of said keys in separate secured safety deposit boxes is FAR more secure with the expectation that you're not going to be fiddling around with it on a weekly basis.
Let's face it...call center is a just a dumb idea, particually because agents need to be focused only solving customer issues not playing babysitter and gatekeeper for the immediate access. It it does is clog the lines and create a bottleneck that can be very very damaging when you keep people waiting. Speaking as a person whose work at several call centers for various companies; it's simply not the way to handle it. At all. Just drop it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:50:13

Here is where I a disagree. It will affect anyone who carries very little physical goods and most of their assets are cash or tied to the markets, which would apply to the poor and paper millionaire alike. A meteoric USD crash, given that it's backed by the US government would mean that there's trouble in the administrative levels of the country, too.
Yea, if they're a wealthy 'prepper' who has already stocked a year's worth of food and guns in an easily defendable area, they'll be fine. If their networth is only on paper, then they'll be as fucked as everyone else (100 million x 0 is still 0). This, of course, would lead to looting and rioting to get by, and once violence and anarchy comes to rule bitcoin means jack shit, unless the majority of wealthy AND poor already use the system.
In regards to Bitcoin being valuable until no Internet or electricity..if the USD crashes to dust, there wouldn't be any reason to keep the electricity flowing; hell it might make coal or oil more valuable to hoard and not use.

By dollar, I'm assuming you'd mean the US dollar, right? Realistically, because the US dollar is so ingrained in the current Western society, there's going to be a lot of shit going down. Would the value of bitcoin jump? Yes. Would there be any reliable way to live in the US and spend bitcoin if shit hit the fan? Probably not immediately.
America is such a huge place that you can't suddenly transition to bitcoin and be all right. Lotta people would be hurting, and when lotta people hurt you get violence. Bitcoin doesn't stop violence. Of course, this would be true of gold too, ever since we moved to fiat, although, gold would have the immediate value of being barter-able without electricity.
