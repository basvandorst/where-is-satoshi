Sell! you can always come back after everything drops another 60%.. don't be the fool who's left holding the bag.

its gonna crash hard over the next few days.. futures will make things way worse. this is nothing compared to tomorrow

yea.. as much as i believe in holding.. this is really bad. time to sell and take your loss. could literally reset to $400 per bitcoin..

there is no such history for this.. it will surely hit back to 2-3k maybe if lucky.. its going to be really bad guys. don't be fooled by ppl who want u to hold right now. take your money and sit on the sidelines until this blows over.. could drop another 50% tomorrow..
