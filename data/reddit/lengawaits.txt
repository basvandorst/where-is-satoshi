I'd have done that if they'd been on OP's pie. I'm tired of how dismissive this community is of anything that isn't BTC. I guess I should expect it.

I haven't seen this much naysaying since the early days of Bitcoin! What an exciting time! Here's a saying I heard a lot back then:


How did that end? In any case I'm on both subs a lot, and I'm noticing a hell of a lot more hostility coming from this side, for what it's worth.

I agree. Dogecoin both owes bitcoin much, and relies on its continued success. The relationship between all crypto is one of synergy... and no, I'm not just throwing buzzwords around. Synergy is the right word for it.
Dogecoin is not without its merits, and we would do well as Bitcoiners to recognize that fact. The confirmation time is faster by a factor of 7. For store owners like myself that's a pretty big deal.

Thank you. I will pay it forward x2!

Perhaps to the topic at hand in OP, but certainly not irrelevant to brick and mortar vendors.

[This is the chart]( we need to be focusing on. Speed is a real issue where crypto adoption is concerned, especially if we hope to compete as a currency.

I understand where you're coming from. For what it's worth (not much to you I'm sure) I've kept all the Doge I've earned through my site so far as Doge. Same with any BTC I earn. I like to diversify. I will say I've gotten a lot of orders in Doge since I started accepting it. People seem to like to pay with it. Have an upvote for contributing to an interesting conversation. Thanks!

I've discussed how, as a vendor, I am concerned about in-person hack-wallets and race attacks:


Can you explain to me how the speed parameter doesn't combat these issues?
So far no one has given me a satisfactory answer. What I have gotten is a lot of dismissive attempts to derail the question and convince me it's not really an issue because third party software can solve it, or we can just do transactions off-chain (again, through a third party, who will presumably want a cut.. right?).

Exactly what is this thread the place for, then, if not discussing Bitcoin in relation to other crypto? 
It's disingenuous to pretend that mattomatica didn't make this graphic in response to the (perceived) threat of Dogecoin and other crypto. 
It's been an extremely hot-button issue on this sub ever since "dogecoin wtf" hit the frontpage the other day. You should probably expect more crossover. I agree that there's hostility happening, but it's not restricted to one group.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:11:52
I get that, and I agree, but I'm concerned that not all store owners that accept Bitcoin are as knowledgeable about that fact! I've been made to wait for confirmation by B&amp;M vendors, and they don't like it when you try to explain how safe it is for them to just trust you. This isn't a made up problem, and I'm not bringing it up because I hate Bitcoin. Please don't take this as an attack.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:05:08
Right. As mattomatica said in response, what's needed is education. I'm not the only person who *has* been made to wait around for confirmations in-store. Vendors don't all know, but they're learning. I do wonder, will the need for confirmations ever really be ignored?
Unless the vendor can be guaranteed that you either A) don't have a hacked cryptowallet made to take advantage of overly-trusting 0 confirmation vendors, or B) don't have malware present on your device that initiates a race attack, they're going to want to have that confirmation.
Please educate me if I'm missing something here.

You touch on this a bit in your post, but I brought this up earlier and would like to hear your perspective(it's been buried at this point):


Thieves are not as dissuaded by cameras as you seem to think they are. Seems like they'd be less dissuaded when the crime is harder to trace or takes upwards of 10 minutes to notice. Plenty of time to get away.
All your other points are totally valid, though. I'm a vendor that accepts both BTC and Doge at my online store. They both work equally well for me, but I don't have a brick and mortar location open... yet. When/if I do I can say with certainty that I'll be more interested in Doge. 
The fact of the matter, though, is that the harder we Bitcoiners fight against Dogecoin the worse we make ourselves look. That's not the sort of image we want to create during a time when Doge users are doing highly visible philanthropic work and BTC prices are dropping.

Hard to say at this point. So far it has reached parity with gold once... about a month ago... right before the last big bubble burst.
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:32:32
You can exchange doge -&gt; USD on vaultofsatoshi.
Many stores, including my own, are beginning to accept Doge in addition to BTC. Just today there was a FrontPaged post about how vendors can integrate doge. Expect a lot more crossover... and maybe diversify.

Why don't they recommend it? I'd be interested to read why they feel it's hazardous if you have a source.
I've provided articles explaining why current scientific inquiry suggests that inhalation of PG/VG is *far more safe* than inhalation of the thousands of chemicals produced by "tobacco" smoke (did you know not all cigarettes even contain actual tobacco leaves?).
Why is it a bad thing to recommend a means of substance satiation that is widely scientifically considered to be healthier than the alternative? Not everyone wants to quit every substance they enjoy. Do you drink coffee? Is it good for your health? Would you be interested in a healthier way to enjoy caffeine if you learned that some substances in roasted coffee were extremely carcinogenic?

Like the many bitcoin naysayers I'm sure we all encounter on a daily basis, you would do well to conduct [a bit of research]( before spreading your uneducated opinion.
[This post]( by is rife with links to peer reviewed information about the safety of PG/VG.
