This competes for the dumbest rant I've read about Gox yet. They fuck up their own implementation of the protocol and you want them to get near the code for the protocol itself? What the fuck?
Furthermore, why should an exchange develop the protocol in the first place? Surely BTC-e has made literally tens of millions off of the blockchain concept and all of its subsequent derivatives. They have been the main litecoin exchange since forever. Should they fund the development of litecoin?
Donating to developers as a corporate gesture of faith is one thing, but to say exchanges "should" do this is...that's just completely outside the scope of their business.

I am aware that exchanges don't sell bitcoins. 


No, because you also have to compare it to the other exchanges. In the light of selling BTC for USD, MtGox is *significantly* more expensive than the other alternatives, of which there are several. And we're not talking a 10% or 20% differential, they're half to nearly 2/3rds "more expensive" if were looking at the inverse relationship of buying USD. When you get to such a significant disparity, one that is unique to a market when all other markets of the same class are cheaper, that's when you have to start considering other factors. And obviously, trust is not *the* determining factor in any price differential -- there are a whole boatload of them, but trust is generally a big one.
The reality is that it's a bitcoin exchange. Nobody thinks of the price of their currency in bitcoins, they think of the price of bitcoins in their currency. Few people start with BTC, they start with their currency and figure out which exchange or broker to trust and buy through. 
Again, the investment manager/guy down the street analogy I made I felt was pretty clear. Maybe to clean it up, Jimmy doesn't have the stock himself, but he says he can find a seller for you at $40. Again, who do you trust to deliver on the deal? Your investment manager, or the guy down the street? Most people would choose the accredited professional, and pay more in consideration for the trust and fiduciary responsibility inherent in that relationship. 
I mean seriously, why do you think people pay more for a brand name product? Why don't we all just fucking drive a Kia? Because through marketing or personal experience, people *trust* that the product or service with the brand name will be of a better quality. 
Trust absolutely affects the price of basically everything that is traded. Depending on the relationship or specific exchange in question, it can also reduce the price, but this is a fair bit more situational and has more to do with B2B relationships than B2C.
If you don't get it, I'm out of options, I don't think I can explain it any more clearly than the example of people, every day, paying more for a brand that they trust than buying the cheaper knockoff. 
I'm not saying the guy's assumption was a good one, but it has certainly got precedent. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:16:14
I do. Nowadays in speech I just say "Gox" but yeah I didn't know the history of the name and given that their own logo has MT with a period after it, Mount Gox is just about the most reasonable pronunciation that any uninitiated english speaker would use. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:35:22
What he said makes perfect sense. Why is the price at Gox so cheap right now? Because people don't trust them. Gox's price was higher even before they got cut off from Dwolla and experienced USD withdrawal issues. Why? Because at that time they were the longest running, largest exchange with a named operator and a relatively trustworthy history. 
To someone who was not familiar with Gox's USD issues, it would be a reasonable assumption to make. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:06:16


It's not about sides of an individual transaction. It's not about the buy/sell, it's about comparing two exchanges side by side. It's really simple. Forget everything you know about Gox and all the problems you've seen them have, and look at it like this.
You can buy BTC from an exchange presumably located in Bulgaria without any knowledge of where their headquarters are really located or who runs the exchange.
Or you can buy BTC from the longest running exchange in the industry, with a named operator and staff and a known physical location in Japan. 
On it's face, most people would trust the latter exchange more, and pay more to use their platform because of that.
That's what was going through the guy's head when he chose Gox. Similarly, anyone looking at the prices now would look at Gox and say, "Well, something is definitely wrong there, I don't know if I can trust that place."
EDIT: I'll make it even more clear. You look at a stock you want to buy, and you talk to your investment manager. He says the stock is running around $50. 
Jimmy from down the street says oh I heard you want to buy, I have some of that stock, I'll sell you shares at $40. He knows he can't sell to you at $50, because you already have that offer from someone you trust more to handle this kind of thing. 
Trust in the exchange itself fundamentally affects the relative price at which any asset trades.

I think the protocol might have the ability for recurring transactions and it just hasn't been developed yet, but even if it doesn't, I can't imagine it'd be hard to program the functionality into the client.

Look, bottom line it's obvious deflection by a CEO about the source of very recent problems with his business. A thousand executives have made a thousand similar statements since forever. He's trying to improve/preserve the public image of the company. Those who don't know might be swayed. Those who know what the fuck has gone down laugh at it for the bullshit that it is, but we don't get all indignant and demand that if a person or company has a problem with Bitcoin, they should write new code for Bitcoin. You're acting as if it's a trivial little thing for a company to just up and hire someone to code a quick fix for a worldwide remittance protocol. 
And again, completely outside the scope of their business. Should Google and Netflix be writing policy for primary bandwith providers to ISPs? Should those providers readily allow individuals contracted by Google and Netflix and Amazon to write policy for the backbone of our connectivity? It's a...bit of a disjointed analogy, I admit, but it's not too far from the post.

Aside from your first sentence (as verified members can withdraw a load of BTC in a day, or at least could before, if needed), I mostly agree.


And when that volume dwindles to nothing, do you think they want the bitcoins that they have earned in fees to be recently devalued by rapid, severe arbitrage, or do you think they'd want them to still be hovering within $50 of $500? 
Again, I basically agree with your sentiments, just pointing some things out.

I don't understand why this is delusional. MtGox served every need that I used them for flawlessly right up until the point I was unable to withdraw BTC. I have lost a lot of trust in them over the months, and was working away from them, but was unable to do so in time. If they have always served my needs as a client, and end up making me completely whole, I don't see how continuing to do business with them is delusional. Risky? Of course.

I don't think they have to return all of them. I'll tell you my personal limit: 80%, maybe 75% if I get to trade for free/extremely cheap for a year. If I get that much back, and Kerpeles resigns, a whole new vetted and competent team comes in and provides transparency and future proof of solvency along with improved customer service...I'd still explore other exchanges, but I wouldn't just completely bail.
If they returned 100% along with all of the above, I don't know that I'd bail all that much, even. It'd take a while, but given a good year or two they are well within reach of earning my trust back completely. A business is great when they don't cause any problems and you never have a bad experience, but I put a special kind of trust in a business entity when they fully right their wrongs.

"Insurance could be relative to the value of bitcoin, instead of making the insured Bitcoins relative to its fiat value"
There are a few ways one can interpret this statement:
Insurance could be relative to the (nominal) value of bitcoin (held in the insured pool/account), instead of making the insured bitcoins relative to their fiat value.
Insurance could be relative to the value of bitcoin (in fiat currency), instead of making the insured bitcoins relative to their fiat value.
Insurance could be relative to the (present fiat) value of bitcoins (at the time of the fraud/loss/theft), instead of making the insured bitcoins relative to their fiat value (at the time the insurance policy is agreed upon).
The first interpretation is the only one I can make any sense of, as the second doesn't make any fuckin sense at all, and the third basically results in a giant fucking loss for the insurer or a continuing increase in the cost to use the service as the price of BTC continues to rise.
That last sentence was the entire point in the first place.

What I'm saying is that it is *not* in human nature to absolve yourself from guilt for anyone who has sense enough to successfully run a business. Maybe your experience has been different, but most anyone I know who is self employed or runs their own business knows the buck stops with them. 
Aside from that, the standard intro for business owners is bitpay or coinbase, I mean I find it hard to believe that a business owner could be at the point of accepting their own funds and *keeping 100% as coins* without knowing, "Gee, the price on this shit can really go for a ride sometimes!"

Transactions are confirmed within blocks in the blockchain. There are several altcoins with varying block times, some faster than LTC. LTC was designed to target 2.5min blocks, BTC 10mins. As computing power increases, blocks are found faster, and difficulty is adjusted to again result in a block roughly once every X minutes for whatever currency you're referring to.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:56:53
Doing nothing? Go ahead. Buy a thousand litecoins right now. You would have bought BTC at $9, am I right? Even when there was basically zero actual currency use/payment network? Even when your real life friends and family laughed at you or listened to you for the sake of courtesy with a vacant nod? I mean hey, litecoin or one of the other many, many altcoins are cheap now. You may as well throw like $2k at one of them, right? Maybe all of them? Just tie a bunch of wealth into this barely viable thing that nobody around you believes in. After all, it'll increase in value, and then you'll be filthy rich for doing nothing at all.


What? You think when those 10k coins were were like 25 bucks he made sure to re-stock/save?


If the first trillionaire is Satoshi, I honestly can't think of any person or group of people more deserving.


Get a coin popular from the start? How the fuck do you propose that's going to happen? What do you think that would do for volatility?

Your first sentence is the whole achilles heel. This business has to insure is capital by 5-10X its actual value, on a continuing basis, just *in case* a bubble hits at the wrong time.


1. BTC price is steadily declining from initial insurance value
2. You can cancel your insurance policy with the company and re-buy another one at a cheaper price while still charging your clients the same fee
3. You can claim on the less expensive insurance policy you just bought.
4. The price doesn't fucking rally back in the time that you've made the claim and received the funds to buy back the BTC and fund your clients as promised.
Charge a daily interest rate based on the total held at that very day? So what, if I hold less, I pay more? I hold more, I pay more? Total held by the bank? A bunch of people make huge deposits and now I have to pay more interest because the bank has more to insure?

So you introduced someone to bitcoins and described storing them offline in a paper wallet, then this person calls you saying he needs to get in your house for x reason at a time you're not there. 
I don't mean to rub it in, I just want you to see how obvious this situation is from an outsider's perspective.
Furthermore, how the hell did he call your number if he didn't have your phone? Mutual friend? You need to tell that mutual friend that the both of you have befriended a fuckin' scumbag.
I'd absolutely call the cops back and state that you realized what was stolen and you suspect who did it. You have a phone call record of him calling you specifically to enter your home on the day of the event. 
Dude trust me, if you don't nip this shit in the bud it won't be the last time something like this happens in life. 
7BTC? That's fucking nearly $7000 at the time of the theft. 
I would absolutely walk away from a group of people who were cool hanging out with someone that jacked me for 7 coins. People like that aren't friends, man, they're just using you for resources, be they physical, capital, or emotional. 
Seriously, it amazes me that you say the loss of the money is the worst part. You can't buy trust. "Oh I'm sorry, I must have left the door unlocked."

Seriously, what in the fuck are you even saying anymore?


So let's back up, recap that mini thread:


What? You think when those 10k coins were were like 25 bucks he made sure to re-stock/save?


That amount of wealth? $25 at the time?


NO! Fucking stars in Heaven, no! I'm not talking about people saving their wallets. I'm addressing your assumption that ANYONE on EITHER side of that 10kBTC/Pizza transaction is rich. At the time 10k BTC was like 15 bucks or whatever. Perhaps the buyer replaced his 10k BTC after be bought the pizza. Perhaps the seller kept the 10k BTC (nope). They were just using a protocol to transfer value at the time, neither of them can be assumed to have known the real value of BTC. 
Yes, I agree, if someone managed to make bitcoin wallet in 2010 or 2011 and made sure to diligently and securely store their bitcoins (which were probably worth a few hundred dollars, IF that), then they would be very rich. So what?


Yes, those who own BTC early on will be wealthier. This is NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAID. What you said was:


Again, please explain to me how 70 million people are going to control 80% of the world's property, labor, and capital. 
Bitcoin does not destroy the value of anything. Bitcoins measure the value of goods and services, like all currency. You're speaking as if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency, dollars and pounds and pesos and rubles and yuan are worthless.

I agree that it's awesome, I'm sure some people with prior connections do it to some extent; they'd be idiots not to, and only 20-30% of them got where they are by being idiots. 
BTC *does not* always transfer faster than a $100 swing on the exchange, and if you're not executing the sale immediately I wouldn't even consider it genuine arbitrage. You're just transferring your assets to a different market and hoping that regardless of overall market movement, the price stays ahead of whatever exchange/market you transferred from.

Third parties come in and secure/hold your bitcoins, taking the responsibility off of you, and charging a fee.
Currently there's very little to no recourse if a company runs away with the money, but in time this has and will continue to become a model for companies worldwide. 
Bitcoin is just a protocol, like HTTP or SMTP. Over time large institutions have and will continue to prove their trustworthiness, and for those who want a total security solution, local storage is always still an option. 
Plus, let's face it, hardware wallets will come in time. Once this happens the whole "omg how do I secure my bitcoins?!/I got hacked/jacked!" will end within months. 
And as far as actual, real world responsibility, local storage being key and everything, I still have yet to see a story of someone who got their coins stolen while using 2-factor authentication.

Read about LinuxLive/unetbootin.

The thing is, coinbase doesn't explicitly guarantee your deposits as secure. To insure a business where 100% of all BTC deposits are explicitly guaranteed is much different than insuring an exchange. 
Also, as far as withdrawals, the OP said they would be instant. 5 working days wasn't the assumption. 
Finally, again, it's not about the insurer ensuring the security of the coins. I agree the risk of loss is low in a secure setup, but history is rife with examples of BTC hacks/theft. It's not a non-zero risk. But the real X factor is insuring against the idea of a loss at 8-12x the price they originally insured the asset for. Furthermore, when the price spikes, that's exactly when theft and insecurity become more likely.
I mean, regardless of what happens, the insurer is going to pay in local currency. If you're talking about some magical insurer that is holding 50k BTC and insures BTC loss directly with its own stores, well, then yeah that would work.

1. Most exchanges require several confirms before you can actually spend the coins. Waiting an hour to arbitrage in the bitcoin market is possible...and borderline financial suicide.
2. The "high priced exchange" historically is Mt. Gox. Unless you live in Europe or Japan, the whole "put the money in your bank account" bit is going to take *months*. Even if you do live outside the US and it only takes a couple/few days, you still have to hope that by the time you get the money, the price of BTC on Gox is still at or below what you paid.

Nobody has the wealth (.1% controlling 80%) of which you speak. 


Provide any evidence that the parties of that transaction held the coins. 


There are *very* few people in the "them" category that you describe (early adopters who kept 10,000+ BTC), and as far as "who does the same these coming years", at this point with the price of BTC, it would take the influence of a MAJOR institution (think multinational bank, government) to control a lot of BTC, and the sudden (or even gradual) influx of capital would only serve to distribute the wealth to everybody who was holding BTC.

Seriously, imagine in your head what you have described. You're saying that within a matter of a few days, an entire populace is going to flock to a new currency. This growth will be extremely exponential. The growth of the currency is going to be linear. Everyone joins on board inside of one month. Do you understand what happens to your currency?
It inflates, just like fiat does right now. Everyone adopts in in weeks, and linearly over the coming months/years the amount of currency increases, causing inflation. Only way to avoid that is constant economic growth in lock step with your growing monetary base. It doesn't work. 


Okay, you trolled me, GG.

I think a company like Coinbase can employ enough diversification and security that their revenues would cover any serious breach. Given the irreversible nature of these transactions, anything other than multiple (like hundreds) of different hot wallets holding the day's/week's transactions along with offline storage for the bigger portion of funds would be nuts.
That being said, beyond security measures I completely agree with you, and once Bitcoin is more well known as a technology I'm sure there will be no worries. Insurance is one of the biggest industries in the fucking world, there's absolutely NO reason to believe that it won't become intertwined with a technology that irreversibly transfers value. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:08:33
I agree, that is the only way it'd be workable, but the scheme of the poster that I was responding to would require an insurance company to hold BTC privately. 
If they don't keep BTC on hand, and BTC experiences a price spike of 400%, and then the insured BTC are stolen, you think the insurance company is just gonna say Oh well okay, it's worth 400% more than what it was a month ago and we didn't change the premium but sure, we'll insure it! Fuck no. They're gonna say, "You've been paying for a $5MM policy, sorry the coins are worth $15MM now, here's your $5MM, good luck with the business."

The thing is that you speak of this with the experience of seeing multiple thousand% fluctuations while also having the benefit of starting from just about the lowest end of those fluctuations as you could.
You've had the time to work out the rough idea of the protocol in your head and understand that it seems to have almost limitless implications for how humans conduct exchange, not just the Bitcoin network in particular, but the whole idea of cryptocoins in general. 
You see the long term value in all of it, and with your entry point you know that there's basically no way you won't come out ahead on the deal regardless of how it pans out.

Cash is also susceptible to loss and theft. The infrastructure of Bitcoin will grow to overcome the average person's general lack of computer security. 
Volatility is expected during initial growth phases. It has a stated, fixed supply, and human demand is variable. I do not understand why volatility is inherently a bad thing when the long term trend is clearly upwards.
Bitcoin does not discourage spending it in transactions. I spent more BTC at $1000 than I ever have. 
The network effect ensures that a competing cryptocurrency will SERIOUSLY need to provide measurable, provable benefits to the idea of cryptocurrencies in order to overtake BTC. These benefits must also be impossible to implement in future revisions of Bitcoin.


This is disingenuous hyperbole not worthy of a response. 


Nothing in the world has "intrinsic value." Value is purely a result of what we can do with a given asset or resource. Also you say no intrinsic value *other than as a medium of exchange*. 
The exchange through a distributed public ledger is *the whole fucking point*. You can't just toss it to the side like it doesn't matter. You are essentially saying, "Aside from its properties that give it value, it has no value!" Does that sound like an intelligent statement to you?


Transactions are broadcast immediately. The percentage of the population that even knows what a double spend is and how it would be carried out is *tiny*, and yet orders of magnitude larger than those with both the knowledge and possible ability to do it. Nobody's going to go through that hassle for $100. How often do you worry that someone is handing you counterfeit bills?

Funny, I just wrote a post that touched on the issue of block time.
I've never understood why people get all uppity about 10 minute blocks. The tx is broadcast immediately. I'm sure that there are technological reasons that faster blocks are better which I am not familiar with, but I'm looking at it from more of an adoption standpoint. I pay some BTC, I can see the 0-confirm tx on the chain. I know I've paid it, the seller knows I've paid it, and they know how EXTREMELY unlikely it is that one could successfully double spend. From a usability standpoint, literally the ONLY time I have become frustrated with the confirm time is when trying to make a trade and I'm waiting for the deposit. Even in that scenario, I probably messed up earlier along the line and should have had my money in order when I knew I'd need to make a trade. Other than that, it has no impact on my use of BTC. 
It's also worth mentioning that you can pay to have the fastest confirmations possible by increasing the tx fee, though this won't get you any faster than 10 minute confirms, just prevent you from having your tx pushed to the next block.

Why did they jump on in the first place?
While most of us may have stumbled upon Bitcoin because we saw some random forum post or because we've been buying drugs online since we were teenagers, I'd say that for anyone who understands the basics of the protocol, we're invested for many more reasons than, "Well a lot of other people are doing this."

You explicitly made it your concern in your original post. 


That amount of wealth? $25 at the time?


So, you don't think this applies to the many, many alternate cryptocurrencies? It's not like Bitcoin is the only one. There is *no way* to make any currency immediately popular. Currency literally depends on the network that accepts it. There is always at least a bit of resistance to accept new methods of transferring value. 


Your previous statement addresses precisely nothing regarding volatility. You want a fucking linear coin, with massive popularity. Most all human movement is intrinsically exponential, and then logarithmic. What happens when you have a linearly mined coin that experiences at first exponential and then logarithmic human adoption? The early adopters will have an even *greater* advantage than they already have had with BTC, and then the last part of the log curve that adopts experiences inflation faster and faster as time goes on (until the final coin, if you implement such a thing). 


Not an ad hom, your knowledge of the topic at hand is in fact relevant to the argument. The .1% could control 80% of the world's wealth? What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:01:49


Maybe you didn't say exactly what you meant to say, but there is data in the Bitcoin economy that directly refutes this statement.
Furthermore, as the network grows the future expected value will line up with its current market value making people much less likely to hoard it speculatively.

The spread isn't so much the issue as the overall price. If there's a spread of $50-$150, but the price is varying by $100-$200 a day, it's not hard to end up on the wrong side of that play.

I don't know that any of us envision Bitcoin as some kind of endgame. *Maybe* some people view it in the perspective of an economic endgame, but not a survival one. 
If the time comes where *electricity* and *the internet* are unavailable in the Western world, you're going to need guns, bullets, and canned food, not money. 
Or maybe just some sticks and stones.
Especially in the case of electricity -- you take somebody's electricity flow away with no prospect of return and half the fuckin' people on this planet are going to need weeks to learn how to continue existing. Myself included. Commerce would continue, but take a massive hit to overall production without any electricity. If there was some kind of unexpected shutdown lasting more than 48hr or if I saw a nuke shroom in the distance, I would immediately drive to my buddy's house 20mi out of town and start loading mags.

There is a possibility that he didn't do it nor was he at all involved, but I find that possibility extremely remote. I mean seriously, you could walk down the street or in a shopping mall with a paper wallet, ask, "Hey, do you want this for free?", and you'd probably get through 10-20 people before anyone could even tell you what the object was. 
In addressing it with him and your other friends, all you have to do is state the facts (which you should, as they all deserve to know the character of the person they're "friends" with):
1. You tell someone about coins, explicitly describing cold storage.
 
2. Someone unfamiliar with you and with BTC wouldn't even know they could be stored physically, or that you had done so. 
3. Within days of your educating him about BTC, he likely checks the price and realizes he can rip you off for untold thousands. (okay not a fact but pretty safe speculation given the outcome)
4. Calls you and learns that you aren't at home, and won't be at home for at least a little while (if you would be there soon, you'd just say hang on I'm almost home, instead you disclosed the key).
5. You get home and your place is sacked, the only thing taken of note being the paper wallet, the purpose and use of which you specifically explained to him. .
Other things I haven't probed but would be relevant: Do you live in a bad part of town? Do people get broken into or not so often? What time of day was it? You mentioned cupboards were open? Like kitchen cupboards and drawers? What thief goes for that? Thieves go for media, computers, personal electronics, jewelery, etc. In and out. They don't shuffle through papers looking for QR codes. Basically if ANYTHING of value was left behind, yet the paper wallet is gone, whoever stole from you knew you, knew that you were familiar with BTC, and that you employed physical wallets for cold storage.
You don't have to accuse anyone of anything. The facts speak for themselves, and anyone with any sense of logic knows you got jacked by a former friend. 
Even if he didn't, it's insanely disrespectful and irresponsible to leave someone's property unsecured and unattended. Anyone who was a "friend" would have to do me a whole shit-ton better than, "Oh shit I'm *really sorry*, total accident! Too bad about the $5k, my bad!"
I'd have this conversation with the thief, let him know I know he stole from me, and never speak with him again. Life's too short and you work too hard to have things taken or withheld from you by people who supposedly care about you. You can't stand for that shit.

I'm not sure if the target block creation time can be changed...I imagine maybe it can but I actually don't think so. If it can, I can't believe it would cause a problem with backwards compatibility. Blocks now don't all come in *exactly* 10 minute increments. When ASICs first came on the scene and the computing power was outpacing the difficulty, blocks were being solved much faster than 10 minutes. 
The bigger issue is that solving a block also mines new BTC, so if you had faster blocks, you're going to end up with more coins in a shorter period of time. Also, block rewards will be halving that much faster (every so many blocks the coins rewarded are cut in half). There are only so many coins that can possibly be mined. If you end up mining all the coins too quickly and your currency issuance is significantly greater than its growth and actual use, the block reward will become basically worthless and you won't have any transaction fees to supplement miners' income. Now you run the risk of centralization/network failure.
That's an extreme scenario, but the block time, reward, tx fees, and difficulty all have to be in an acceptable balance in order for the network to be secure in the long term. Even if technologically possible, the implications make it highly unlikely that a coin ever changes its block time significantly.

no, you go to Gox, there are options in the "security center" right above the "Sell/Buy" button. Three different panels at the top of the page. You can require your 2fa to change your security settings, withdrawal, and login. Even if an attacker has compromised your login, he would still need physical access to your phone to steal your funds. A couple people in the past have gotten fucked over because they didn't enable 2fa beyond the login. They login, virus hijacks the session, steals funds. As long as you require 2fa to change security and transfer as well as login, it's really not so bad. I hate to say it, but despite Gox's flaws (shithole tx times for BTC transfers, USD requires descendents to withdraw) they've probably got one of the safest non-local wallets a person can have.

No, god, you're so wrong it hurts. They can't just print a bunch of fiat and buy in. That would cause the WHOLE MARKET to increase in price. If they went after 20% of BTC aggressively, that last 100k would cost them BILLIONS. You think they can just put up a 5bn ask at $800? I fuckin wish. 
It's not that the impact of inflation would be small, it's that the impact of a shitload of fiat injected into the market for bitcoins...help my fuck, buddy, governments buying bitcoins en masse? You think that'd be some kind of problem? Literally nothing better could happen.

You got a long several months/years ahead of you. I lost literally thousands of dollars in the spring of this year. Not paper losses. Real losses. But even after that, I checked my panic at the door, and I bought back in. Bigtime. 
Then I watched my investment halve. Only this time, I just held. 6 months later I'm more than whole, I still have some coins set aside, and plan on buying more when the price stabilizes. 
If you did your research, you know why the protocol is amazing and why you invested. 
It's not the end of the world...unless you don't understand a thing about BTC and used your rent money + borrowed money from your dad to try and get a quick 300% by buying near the all time high after a 1000% increase because you saw some blurb on a website somewhere. In that case it probably does feel like the end of the world.

Not in my experience. The thing is, selling your BTC for $$$, they now have possession of that for good. There's no going back. They can exchange/pool/hedge or do whatever the fuck they want to do with it, immediately. Buying your BTC, the ACH takes time, and they are at risk of ACH rejection/nsf/etc if you're set up for instant buy. 
Unverified account besides linking my checking, I sold 2 coins on Nov 29th to be paid out on Dec 2nd. Market had a 20% shift in that time. I got the money they said I would. The market did end up recovering, but that's beside the point. 
Who knows if they'd hold the same standards for a 50% drop, but given their status, backing, and my own experience, I'm relatively confident.
