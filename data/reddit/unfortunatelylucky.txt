In this case it's just basic decency my guy, and I'd hope everyone's capable of that.

It doesn't motivate people to not express their viewpoints though. If you decide to Tweet that black people are violent, and 50 people tweet back telling you your opinion is stupid then they're just exercising their free speech.
If someone wants to go out with a loudspeaker calling for a genocide then they're not just being un-PC, they're calling for violence and should rightfully feel afraid to express their opinion.
I don't think anyone's calling for you to not express your opinions, just to be mindful that you don't use racial slurs. That's really not too hard to ask and anyone incapable of doing that isn't likely to have anything valuable to say anyway.
I will say that people facing no risks of oppression have the privilege of not having to view certain 'un-PC' talking points as rhetoric used to disenfranchise them but rather as abstract debate positions that don't have any effect over them.

I mean it's literally doing the bare minimum and attempting to not use language that harms oppressed groups, and I'm suspicious of anyone who is more concerned about being asked to not be sexist or racist than they by actual discrimination.
Being nice to people is the opposite of toxic to individuals and society.

Really baffles me that you think that the only reason people want to oppose oppression is because it makes them feel good, rather than because it's the right thing to do. 
If you view every social interaction as transactional and society as a collection of Randian individuals then I can see where you're coming from, but that's a cold, insular and fairly soulless way to go through life. Let's not forget that evening Rand died claiming welfare through a false name.
You're absolutely wrong to say that it's 'actually sexist and racist to operate on a "group" level' when there are plenty of examples of systemic racism and sexism to be concerned about. I imagine though that you don't believe either exist enough (or at all) to be enough of a problem to care about though.

Obviously they're different.
You asked for examples of systemic racism in the 21st century, and I'd point to the fact that black people are overrepresented in prisons, and when charged with the same crime as whites are much more likely to receive harsher sentencing.
Just look at the fact that the number of African Americans in prison for marijuana offences despite the fact that both white and black people smoke weed at the same rate. I'm sure you'll be able to explain this away though, for whatever reason 'individualists' seem to be terrified of admitting that different groups of people generally have incredibly different life experiences.
Aware that the word slave has Slavic origins, and it's an example of political correctness that I don't make jokes about Slavic skull shapes or imply that they have lower IQs to my Polish friends. Eastern European immigrants already face a host of problems, so why would I make that more difficult by repeating discriminatory talking points?

I've already seen it and it's a decent video but I don't understand how it relates to anything I said. I took on board your viewpoint, disagreed with it and then you reply essentially telling me to listen to people I disagree with.
Him being black doesn't really affect his point though given that he's not talking about anything unique to his experience as a minority.

As a Brit I assumed that for some reason the Irish Republican Army had adopted Bitcoin as their currency.

20 confirmations, yet only four blocks have been mined since I made a deposit so it could take some time.

I don't think those words mean what you think they mean

Okay well communism is the name given to a stateless and classless society in which the workers own the means of production and private property has been abolished, not 'the government printing money'
