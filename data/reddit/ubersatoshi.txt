If majority of miners run specific consensus rule implementation I guess most non-miners will switch for that as well. It will be like snowball effect when one chain wins. Do you propose some voting mechanism for non miners?

Wow  :)

Consider hardware wallet like Trezor of Ledger wallet. Keep your wallet mnemonic seed in a secure place and your bitcoins are safe!
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:18:54
Same thing as recovery card :) You can think of Trezor as a cold storage where you can spend your bitcoins safely.

So, you will release the code and chinese miners can decide to run it? Kind of 2Mb version of Bitcoin Core.

It's really sad that this much money was poured and lost on hyped unproven technology. Maybe world does not need Ethereum. It was highly expensive and short lived experiment.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:19:12
If price of bitcoin keep rising and blocks stay small it'll soon be very expensive payment method.
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:15:24
Probably not. It might have minor impact on price, but nothing that matters much.
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:10:23
Bitcoiners do not hold. We hodl.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:20:59
There can be no competition with China.

I remember reading from Tim Draper interview that he might bid.
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:20:47
It's happening right now.
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:48:49
You need asics, like Antminer S9.
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:59:19
Who are Bitcoin users? They're miners, hodlers, developers, merchants and businesses using bitcoin... list goes on and on.
How do you measure opinion of entire community? What kind of actions are needed once opinion of majority is clear?
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:37:17
Excellent work.
@_date: 2016-05-11 13:26:26
That's what I call healthy competition.
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:57:46
That guy is out of his mind.
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:34:00
That sub is disgusting - it does not have anything to do with btc other spreading FUD about it. is full of ethereum trolls.

U3 has same chip as S3 and it has roughly 1/7 of S3 hashing power. Maybe they'll come up with new pod miner with bm1387 chips - it's also very power efficient chip so it kind of makes sense to produce miner for hobbyists.
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:27:01
One solution is not enough for Bitcoin. We need HF, SW and Lightning.
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:19:49
More hash per USD then. I guess value of S7 will be very low soon. You have to keep in mind that you need to host more low hash miners and PSUs to achieve same level of total hash rate with them, so it might add cost and more risk with failing electronics.

They are not anti core posters. They are anti bitcoin posters.
@_date: 2016-05-16 08:43:36
Core dev team please remove ASIC mining support now! I want to use my GPU for mining and asics have unfair advantage!
EDIT: Damn it! Also gpus and cpus have patents. Can we go to pencil and paper mining phase soon?!
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:23:48
No, that's in Sweden.
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:41:47
This is great news!
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:41:20
Fee market is not sustainable solution. Financial transactions will find path of least resistance, just like water and electricity.
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:27:16
If you just want to mine for learning purposes or just as a hobby, buy some USB sticks. Hashrate does not matter at all in this situation.
If you want profit then S9 is only opinion.
@_date: 2016-07-14 11:27:44
No risk? If your coins are in exchange you don't own them.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:03:38
In theory yes. Counterparty protocol introduces more bloat for Bitcoin mainchain, but Bitcoin protocol does not handle that additional data anyway; it only acts as a transport layer for it. It's up to Counterparty protocol to interpret and parse that data.

Hodlers beach
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:46:27
Why you use them? Get rid off them, they're not bitcoin company.
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:48:31
RSK has dedicated sidechain and XCP is metacoin in Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:06:40
Who are they and how they'll trick Bitcoiners to use nodes that break consensus rules?
