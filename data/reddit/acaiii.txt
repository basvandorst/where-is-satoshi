Aha! I must have overseen that.
I'm neither a blockchain expert. I just understand the concept.
From the image in the article I can see the various larger transactions that sum up to 530K
Wouldn't it be logical and a good idea to get an overview of all the transactions that match those amounts, during that time period?
You say that "we" know of the 165K. What about the 80K one for example? Or are there a large amount of 80K transfers in that period?
Input and if you have, a link to an good thread regarding the 165K transaction would be highly appreciated.
Cheers and all the best

Ok. And can anyone else confirm that you have connections to the "inside"
Maybe a lot of people know you here. But personally I don't.

And a question I am asking myself now is, WHY did the judge approve bankruptcy protection - if the case was that everything had gone to shit?
Maybee it's a far fetch. But are there anyone here that can comment from a legal/Japanese perspective?

The last sentence in the statement, is a pretty fucking bold statement. Or?
"MtGox Co., Ltd. continues to make efforts to clarify facts as quickly as possible and to *recover from damages."*

wankers... and only bs comments by trolls.
save the hate.
we have no idea of what the future has waiting for us. 
yes, there is a big chance that everything goes to shit. who knows.

"This PR team apparently sees nothing wrong with this Sponsor’s association with Silk Road Equity LLC (I am not shitting you)."
I don't get this? What's mentioned in the document, and Silk Road??
The FBI have seized their assets.... Is this a company with the same name.
QUE?

-Mahn: I'm no blockchain scientist.
Maybe u are? :)
What are your/the communities thoughts on monitoring the blockchain for suspicious transactions/mtgox related addressees, after they shut down the API.
I suppose we have to wait until they become transparent and revile their cold wallet addresses, or?
Also, in regards of the Japanese newspaper article about 530K coins being moved after between the 7th and 10th. 
Any good data or arguments in regards of that.
And lastly, why the newspaper article? Wouldn't it be appropriate for such information to be revealed on mtgox.com thorough the court/lawyers.
A lot of questions from a frustrated victim.
Best of luck to u all and keep up the good work.
Good night!

Can anyone please explain me why all the wallets haven't been found? Mtgox is an early adaptor, and my logic says that their large wallets from the early days should be public knowledge. They seem not to be from what I have found online.
So is the answer that they just never were transparent as a company - and that we only know of the 200K wallet due to MK's public "proof" of solvency when he moved the 424242 amount in 2011?

A lucky guess, or based on that fact that half of reddit and bitcointalk, already have found the coins before the 4th of March.
If this wasn't the case, I would have had more hope.
But who knows. 
I'm gonna get down on my knees and pray now

And which also is a PDF file that can be very easy edited. Time will tell boys. Best of luck to us all
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:33:57
The 200K wallet was found by redditors and bitcointalk at March the 7th
EDIT: and officially annouced by MTCOCK on the 20th
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:22:17
Thank you for pointing that out!
And keep up the good work man ;)

i cant seem to find any good reddit discussions regarding this article.
obviously it would be visible on the blockchain if this  were true.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:35:15
Interesting. Still haven't found a English/Japanese speaker to confirm this - anyone else come up with something?
Evidence would have to be based on them publishing some sort of database where account numbers are listed or such. That could be used for something.
Having evidence could be several things:
- Bank transfer (but this would be irrelevant to the actual balance on BTC/FIAT - as some people have been holding, some have been trading-  gaining or loosing)
- Print screens could be evidence. But those who didn't predict them going up in dust, most likely don't have printscreens.

Another valid question is regarding miners who historically / early on, deposited large amounts of coins to gox.
I can't seem to find any discussions regarding this.
It must be able to track some of these transactions down.
Guys: thoughts on this?

same here. mine is correct! this is legit

Worth a shoot!
The people behind savegox have great history/and reputations. 
And the community in general would only benefit from a rehabilitation.
Read the leaked document. I could live with those timelines.

Good clarification and comments, -Mahn.
You are a random, but good guy.

Have a good night mate!!

check mtgox-chat on freenode if u doubt it. what motivation would be behind bullshitting?
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:49:51
