When is BRICS going to lay down their internet so we can get this whole decentralization thing going.

Just thought I'd place this here, they hype cycle.

Perhaps for those who had it as an investment, but for those who want to be able to fight the fed this is nothing.  I've heard many say this might be a Napster moment, hell even if it is, cryptocurrencies will live on.

Forget third parties, the point of bitcoin is that ur ur own bank.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:23:17
Is Neteller a middle man cause if it is, than that's a form of centralization which is what I thought bitcoin was against.

PayPal is the bank, USD is the currency.

lol, if that's your belief well all I can say is that we differ on that greatly.  I believe most people tend to be more secular and would of been, but we the American government aid the religious extremist in overtaking the secular people and we fund them with the promise that their zealous objectives can be complete with our aid.  So I see the opposite actually happening.  Poor men do not want war, it is mostly the rich.  Once a farmer goes to war all he goes back to again is a farm, while the rich man who stood back gains many riches.

Yes but even if the Jehovah's witnesses said and acted polite would you believe it.   From what I saw he was challenging him to debate.  Which is needed to get people critically thinking about money.
The guy might be threatened cause his ego is attached to what he thinks what is but when all alone in front of the computer he'll do his research and see.  I've converted a few die hard conservative Christians to agnostic the same way.

Over one million people watch The Zeitgeist Movement with that a lot of people got screwed over by the banks, not only here but in Europe also.  There are a lot of people questioning the meaning of money.  My mom who's nowhere near tech savy was curious about this and what is money itself.  As for me I don't do it for hedging but to break the monopolization of money and I can't be the only one with a great number of growing left and right libertarians.

Bitcoin is the beginning of cryptocurrencies and though maybe a majority might be held by the bank it's not much worse now, plus it opens the door for other cryptocurrencies.  Let them hold onto it and make their spenditures as they say fit.  This money would truly trickle down instead of some abstract stock.
Plus how do u know, is the majority of bitcoins tracked to a few ip addressess or is their a wallet with major money in it.  Not even a link?
It's not a no-no, people enjoy debate they're trying to get all the kinks out.  They want to see hackers hack it to make the code stronger.
Well I agree with deflationary economics and competition is always a good thing.
I haven't heard of people saying they're lost forever,  and yes early adopters of anything should be rewarded.

Yes, I also believe that this is a change in the system.  With the advent of Bitcoin and Meshnet it's already starting.  Also with this NSA debacle people are really having an open mind to conspiracy theories.
I think in my eyes and in many others the government has lost it's greatest power, that of it's nobility.  Now a significant of the nations citizens see the government as the enemy as much as the government views them as an enemy.
I hope to live for the next six years and see where this is going to go, and as cynical as I am.  I do not believe it's going to go somewhere very far from where we are now.  :-D

Just like a sleeper will have to wake up on sometime so will the people.  My sister asked about the petrodollar and my mom a computer illiterate did research on what is money and the American currency.
TV - Internet has more options then TV and torrents.
Credit Cards/EBT - based on the American dollar and don't forget people hate for Monsanto also the cutting of funds to food stamps.
Fast Food - true but people are also vain creatures who want to look good.
Malls- in an economy many of us can't afford to get what's inside their.
Walmart - true but even they're facing competition from people like Costco's.
Give it some time as hard as it maybe, just because you get it doesn't mean everyone does.  Doesn't mean their stupid it's just the same reason people get degrees at different ages.
Now excuse me I got to get a little dance in to joy me up with the whole Syria thing.
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:24:20
Nah I'm just going to get one cause the banks screwed my family over and I see the need for such things, and I know I'm not the only one like this.
Most people won't get it, but I do believe atleast ten percent of the population does.

We survived the HSBC giving billions to terrorrist organizations and we fund terrorist organizations with our tax dollars.  Calm down it's going to be alright.  Every bad thing you mention that can happen with bitcoin already happens with the USD.  Well almost everything, except inflation and printing out more and giving to your buddies.

It would also help them go around the problem with them trading with Iran.  With the coming decrease of value coming to the Rupee and sanctions.

It's bound to go higher, if other nations are taking part of this.  It'll go higher and in few years we won't be selling them but using bitcoins themselves as currency :-)
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:38:34
They're in charge of the currency they have to have something to back it up. ;-)  Can't blame them if they kill millions and millions of people, hey Mammon got to eat.

Yaaaawssss lawd!!!! I just came on here to see if anyone else had that sentiment also.
If I can live a healthy good life and witness the power of a nation state weaken then I'll be one happy soul when I die.  My kids will live a better life.

I'm actually a socialist and if the government agencies were acting half way what I thought they should be acting, I would agree with you.  But as they cut food stamps, cut education, tax cuts to the rich, while raise taxes on the poor with fees and the like.  I have to say capitalism would be better then what we have here in America.  2 trillion given to the banks and I'm powerless to stop it.  Here's a chance for something different and I'm going to try my darndest to support it.
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:52:11
Diversity in the market, I'm not against it.  I guess your right on seeing it like that.
@_date: 2013-08-17 06:24:00
Oh so ur using bitcoin as a hedge,  well I use bitcoin to say fuck u to the banks who screwed over a lot of Americans.   I can still order stuff online,  for goodness sake look how big Amazon is and that's only one of the online shops.
I understand the hedging go on ahead, but for me it's an expression of liberty.

Hate to tell you this kompiler, but 1+1=3 now.  SILENCE!!!!  The King of Math has spoken.

Well the people of Kenya use bitcoins all you really need is a series of numbers for your wallet and a key to verify and transfer.  To be honest idk how they did it, but they did it with very low tech phones.  Just look up Kenya and bitcoins ;-)  Hopefully that has helpe.d
