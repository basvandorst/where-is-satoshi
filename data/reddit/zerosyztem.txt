They need to find both vendors and buyers. Then tie in Ulbricht. A tragedy would sell best. Vendor getting busted. Buyer losing his/her life and dpr in court to end it. I find you guilty and sentence you to life. So Be It!

agreed.  atm it is a steep investment for an interested investor in a still emerging currency. Not to mention the fees robocoin keeps and the fact you would likely have to give 30-40% to the owner of whatever store you put this in or around. Couple that with the fact that 90% of the people you talk to dont even know what bitcoin is.

yeah its been down for awhile. I am wondering if this will cause panic sells when it comes back up.

Or he already has 5 accounts all in good standing each charging different fees or only accepting a certain type of payment. So losing one is like whack-a-mole. Because he has 4 more and will have a new one in good standing before he gets bashed again....

hmmm this is not good. I have some BTC on coinlenders so I will need to move it to inputs before I can take it out... Hopefully this problem will be resolved by the time the CD matures.

Dude I just left vegas. Literally I'm on the shuttle home. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:05:38
its down again!!!
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:59:37
not really. Its all on paper. Simply print out new wallet, Scan QR, deposit ~2BTC and toss into the safe.

Back up!

Mt. Gox will always be the AOL of exchanges.

split it up then move to cold storage is what I would do... I have about 50 cold storage devices without any single one with more than 2 BTC.

thats assuming gox doesnt go belly up and disappear while you wait for the market to crash to buy back and resell to recoup and make profit. Given the fact that everyone I have talked to hasnt had a deposit go through from gox to the US in months I think the former is more likely to happen first.

not more so than "one dollar"

I am surprised you got a response so quickly. When I had trouble with them locking my bitcoins in the account for 30 days even though I deposited via a money order it took them a month and a half to reply!

Don't you see, that's the Genius of it.
