The thing is, this code is in every computer that processes bitcoins. The entire network (or at least a majority of it) would have to have this altered all at once.
This could hypothetically be done, but, well... "herding cats" doesn't even begin to describe the problem. Especially when you consider that everyone using ASICs would have to buy new physical hardware.
In practical terms, it's effectively a fundamental property.

I want to play real life Angry Birds with that!

Not entirely true. Deflation is harmful to anyone with a debt.
This would actually be a serious concern if someone were to take out a mortgage in bitcoins.

Except that 1BTC now buys more. In practical terms, it has magically turned into more money and become more difficult for you to pay off (deflation almost invariably triggers salary cuts.)

A: It's completely DEcentralized. There is no one spot where someone can "turn off" a miner's supply.
B: There's no "authority" because the process is completely automated. Basically, the protocol is a giant machine. It produces bitcoins for the miners the way its been programmed, but it has no control over this, and neither do its creators or anyone operating the machine (the miners.) 
If someone wanted to go "I no like-a your face, you're not getting the coins you mined," they'd be out of luck because the only way to do this would be to literally shut down every single computer in the world that's part of the network -- in short, it would be like trying to take control of the entire internet at once.
So no, there really is no central authority here. Calling the protocol an authority is a stretch, since it can't make any decisions or choices as such.
