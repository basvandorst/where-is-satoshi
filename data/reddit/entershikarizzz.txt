Yeah I store my coins there and its quite safe so long as you practise safe internet practises
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:39:06
Don't tell me what to do.
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:13:07
Did you actuallly watch the charts every single day? every single hour?
That's what I've been doing since last summer.
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:53:46
can you really see moments in your life in the chart?
I can definitely see the week I spent in Salamanca in the chart during the Segwit2x dip. I'm wondering if I'll be able to do it for moments in my life for the rest of it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:24:32
can you buy bitcoin with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:24:19
I literally have no more fiat to buy with
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:05:05
That was literally the top.
Literally the day of the top.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:11:04
ok, send to here: 35BpnBvWDTLTseG2bFzmcrAkfK3PMGcUtQ 
and I'll send 0.05 back to you

WHY IS BCASH GOING UP I SOLD AT 200 AND NOW ITS AT 300???? NOTHING MAKES SENSE
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:17:57
You need to do it to scale, not just every 5k
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:55:47
same but 0.2btc
Even though I've made money I really wish I found out about bitcoin last year.
I guess people's hunger for money is insatiable 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:33:18
My ledger is giving me a "Sending Failed. An error occurred. Please try again later" on 50 sat/byte
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:28:27
cool I'll give 20 a go
just need 3 to trade on bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:53:40
can you pls insert a tl;dr
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:53:57
my 10sat/byte tx took about an hour and fifteen minutes to get confirmed last night, which I thought was kinda long considering 7 blocks went by without including my tx
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:29:58
yes, yes it does.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:29:36
my ledger just isn't working right now
That sucks, just gotta brace for the dip I guess
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:04:20
Yeah that's not my point. This has nothing to do with wars.
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:37:54
in person drug deals.
How do you transfer dollars to a drug dealer online without Visa/paypal etc. knowing?
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:39:20
can easily mask your ip with a vpn/tor
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:34:23
Do they have different mechanisms of action? I'm currently writing a college paper on asicboost and would like to see the whitepaper for the new overt asicboost as I already have the whitepaper for the covert one
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:54:57
watching that made me realise that crypto is still in a bubble
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:14:59
absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:30:13
he must be Spanish
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:15:42
wars are made public, they're not intended to to be kept secret. 
There's just nothing there to do with cryptography.
You're just not getting my question. I don't have time to try to explain it to you, sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:29:38
yes, but none of those coins would exist without satoshi creating bitcoin, and no one would access the dark web and silk road without tor.
Now, back to my question. You think he knew it would be used for malicious purposes? We paint him in such a heroic light, but what hero would enable the easy and simple payment of hitmen over the internet?
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:54:17
I think I understand it now but the flow of logic in that paper could be better IMO
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:24:48
they can't pin bitcoin addresses to identities tho
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:19:27
Firstly, its not a meme.
Secondly, It definitely has something to do with bitcoin, since bitcoin made is so much easier to facilitate the purchase of drugs online while remaining anonymous. You can't deny that a fair portion of the transactions done throughout bitcoin's history has been to silk road. 
It's the cryptographic element of this medium of exchange that makes me ask this question. Surely satoshi would have thought that the cryptographic security and privacy that comes along with bitcoin would allow it to be used for various different illegal and malicious things. 
You can't get that with Visa.
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:31:20
obviously, but that's not online electronic cash
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:18:46
See I actually would've been able to buy it sooner if I did a bank transfer since it took me a week anyway, but I wanted to pay with card and almost every exchange I found couldn't verify my identity or had issues with my IP address etc. I finally managed to get verified with cubits.com and buy on there with card
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:46:59
Sorry could you repeat in English please?
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:03:36
What's your number? I'll call you next time I need a taxi. I have the Jaxx wallet on my phone but I've never been given the opportunity to use it
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:40:02
lol I'm 22
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:50:04
seemed logical to me at the time. If the markets are going down and I short then I gain back what my portfolio has lost. If the markets go up and I get margin called, I lose a tenth of my portfolio but then my portfolio would increase 10% in value too. It worked at first but I've actually lost bitcoin from getting liquidated with the bounces, so maybe its best to find another strategy haha
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:50:45
I got into bitcoin last August too, yet I'm still obsesssed with it. Albeit to a lesser degree than before December.
I'm not as obsessed with prices anymore though, still obsessed with the technology and TA
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:00:58
yeah that was the plan. To break even, since my portfolio was already up from when I bought
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:09:10
That's not what I asked and that's the whitepaper for the original covert one
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:31:28
I think a lot of people including my father think that a government backing a currency's value is a safer bet than no guarantee at all. With no one to regulate bitcoin its like the wild wild west, where China and JP Morgan can manipulate its value
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:17:03
It might have already hit its low
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:04:41
what places accept bitcoin? Any near Trinity?
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:02:52
whynot? What if everyone sold their bitcoin and price went to 0? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:16:07
I disagree, as a theoretical physics graduate I found it quite difficult to buy bitcoin at first. I wanted to buy in July at the low of $1900, but it took me a full week before I could get set up on an exchange and buy some, by then the price was $2800. Believe me this was not out of laziness
I was helping my friend buy some yesterday. She's very smart herself, yet even she said "like I'm trying to buy high tech coins on the interwebz and I gotta search for this yoke" haha
My cousin was also reluctant to upload ID because he is paranoid of big pharma and NSA and all that shite
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:20:25
It was the verification process. None of the exchanges would accept my IDs for verification cause they're all automated. I managed to get verified on cubits but that's because they have a person verifying your identity on a live webcam session
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:37:34
I'm taking a tenth of my portfolio value and using it to short at x10 leverage on BitMEX
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:33:37
We actually don't know how crypto will perform in an economic crash, since its never been through one
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:37:52
how could it go to 0 then?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:40:53
soon, cause the last few pumps have had pullbacks and kept going. Also the current bull run has been 2 years in the making. We need 5-10x increase in a month or two before we see an extended bear market
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:44:08
I understand it, but I didn't know how to retaliate to his question. At the time I completely forgot about fractional reserve banking

I hate the way the cnbc reporter is incredulous to believe that bitcoin isn't a bubble and that it won't implode.
ffs stfu you stupid bitch haters gonna hate lol HODL 
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:48:05
lol k
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:59:39
I would agree with this if it was clean energy, but I think polluting the atmosphere and worsening global warming isn't worth mining bitcoin.
Why can't they just store the natural gas until its needed?
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:31:11
Think he's making a reference to bitcoin gold
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:36:56
good point
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:39:22
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:37:32
Yeah when he brought up the "no internet, no bitcoin" argument I told him about the bitcoin satellite lol
He actually said "countries and governments can just turn the internet off" and he was adamant that this could happen. I thought that's a ridiculous idea, that there would be absolute chaos
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:37:56
It needs to go way higher without a pullback before it goes down
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:17:05
haha wtf this has taken a dark turn
