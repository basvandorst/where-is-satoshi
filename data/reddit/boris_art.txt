And I wasn’t saying anything arrogant. Calm down.  It would be great to hear the reporter look back on these questions and react to them.

This is great.  I want to hear an interview with the guy conducting the interview, watching himself ask these question.

I agree with this and I’m actually in a similar situation/understanding as you.  However, I’ve got to believe that the banking system and “traditional” money/fiat has lingo and technicalities like this as well.  There’s been so much infrastructure, customer service, and marketing built around fiat, that companies (banks?) handle the complicated lingo/system and in turn offer a service to the average user that simplifies it.
My point is, anyone in the subreddit is a pioneer who has to deal with these things simply because there aren’t services out there to simplify it yet (at least not to the scale fiat has).  So I think that down the road, adoption will get easier and simpler as bitcoin marketing matures.

You wouldn’t believe how many Christians believe bitcoin is the “single world currency” described to be used by the antichrist in Revelation. 
PS: Just making an observation, not bashing. I’m a Christian, but I don’t believe in the Antichrist/End-Times.

So let’s say that bitcoin continues to chip away at fiat and this current architecture.  What results when banks don’t have enough money to loan out as credit?
