I just posted about itbit.com there. The website works fast enough. Submissions are getting quicker. I don't see anything other than "Good Job" to you.
Goodluck to you.
No for me please. If you want to reward extra bits. Do so with the btc address I posted there.

@_date: 2015-05-13 08:46:32
Why 21 is advertised by a lot? Isn't it just another company trying to land in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:30:48
I stay around until I get a regular income. Then I have to decide on the real world work load.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:00:35
So far I didn't realize any reward to my post. May be you're busy with  tweaks. Finish your job first. Make the site stay live and work well and leisurely tip me. Thanks.

Ok! I will read about 21.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:02:58
Worse for me. Once I noticed btc going heights and heights, I started into bitcoin and lost my real job. You can understand as with the falling price of bitcoins, my life is also. I'm too late to understand and now looking for real jobs.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:41:27
So you're getting free ideas, such a cheat.
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:30:07
Check for networthsigns. If you want to tip me let me give you btc address. No please.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:50:36

Don't think about losses. Bitcoin will rise.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:49:16
Yes, I understand that. Keep going.
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:59:37
Nice to hear. Good luck.
Why don't you adopt existing giant freenlancing sites for bitcoin payments instead of creating a new one?
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:18:40
Good luck
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:49:34

If you already have eobot account, post your eobot's userid here or create a new one and post here. As Op mentioned, the btc will be added to eobot's existing balance.

Well! You need to be at bucks stall and sponsor a coffee by introducing foldapp along with the paper wallets printed from foldapp.
Also suggest, how they can gift coffee to friends and families with foldapp + bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-14 03:08:44
It will!
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:56:35
Good luck with your efforts. But a 'x' question to commentors, is there any 503(c) complaint charities that accepts bitcoin as donations?
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:46:14
Such not good.
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:14:16

@_date: 2015-04-16 20:40:20
Issue paper wallets to introduce starbucks fans as coupons.
Remind, issue to people those who are not aware of bitcoins. A kind of marketing to promote coffee.foldapp.com
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:07:52
Thank you too

I'm working on a long time research to hack ECDSA keys. If I'm successful I might break the internet.

Today seeing lot of bitcoin holders posting here. Congrats
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:09:33
Well said. However, I raised the question cos., they have large userbase, competing with them to attract people is tough.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:40:49
It is money still. People come in. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 07:27:44

Average customer don't know about it. And they don't even want to know about it.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:40:14
Yes, If controlled by banks, then there is no point of decentralization.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:35:10
Bitcoin has come through a long way. It is better for them to simply accept bitcoin rather than creating new one. Even if they create new one, the new currency can't be a rival for bitcoin.
