It went to a good cause! That reception was $1000, up to $25,000 to charity.

How much will they lose when they convert that to fiat? Anything? We pay 1% on Coinbase and a bit less on btc-e.

"I lost a small percentage of my coins. I am suffering to. I am with you, my friend."

It comes off a bit tacky, trying to build rapport with other Bitcoiners by bringing up how much you lost. He tried to evoke feelings of solidarity, but that has the opposite effect. It makes the following paragraphs come off quite contrived. It's another reminder that Bitcoin is top-heavy, that he is one of the "oligarchs" of Bitcoin.

Isn't Bitcoin just pseudoanonymous? You can track movements of it, right?

When was dominated by posts making fun of people who thought it was a company, e.g. "He said CEO of Bitcoin! HAHAHA!", you know there's a huge in-group/out-group mentality and it's become a circlejerk.

I think he made a good point, though, highlighting the tenacity of bitcoiners. Many of us do see ourselves as building a new world order, if Vorhees' recent post and your comment about "overturning centuries of serfdom and decades of neofascism" is anything to go by. The success of bitcoin is important to many of us, not at a financial level, but an ideological one, as well. He's free to make his own value judgment on the usefulness of bitcoin. No harm done.

Former US Ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, said the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights are "a letter to Santa Claus... Neither nature, experience, nor probability informs these lists of `entitlements,' which are subject to no constraints except those of the mind and appetite of their authors."

Me too! I got it a year ago, totally forgot about it until the recent story in The Guardian. Trying to get more but have to verify my bank account and a bunch of other crap. =/
