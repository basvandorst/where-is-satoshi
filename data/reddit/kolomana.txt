Be careful adding them to coinmap.   You'd hate to have someone go into a restaurant assuming they can pay with bitcoin, only to find out they actually have to order online through your site. 
But your business looks great and it is always nice to see more merchants accepting btc. 
Edit:  maybe you can list them on coinmap but direct the link to your site?

If your agent is afraid of looking bad,  why not drop him and find another that will provide better client service? It is your property and you are the one taking the risk here, so it's your prerogative to do what you want.

I always see people suggesting the dice rolling method.....   I realize that with enough characters you'll get good security, but I always wondered why you would limit yourself to 6 characters(numbers 1-6) when you have an entire keyboard to choose from.  Couldn't you get a more secure result by just pressing tons of random keys all over the keyboard?  
I'm not intending to use a brain wallet so that I have a memorable phrase, I'm using it to generate the random key, which I will keep securely offline.

Is this only for net profit, or any sale?  I may have sold a little during that period, but likely without net profit. 
I made some poor decisions, tried trading, lost some coins, and eventually learned some lessons and became a holder, but certainly didn't cash out and profit during that time.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.  You cannot legally receive a gift or private loan as a large deposit just to help you qualify for a loan. I was scrutinized the same from my bank for transactions unrelated to bitcoin. Basically, you can't try to quickly pad your account to show you're in a better financial situation than you really are.

Upvote because this is the real story.  It has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Same thing happened to me.  They accused me of violating the same sections and I even offered to provide proof that I owned the private keys to all the coins.   I had been buying from them for a while and had moved some of the coins around between various addresses.
In the end I have no interest in doing business with them if they accuse customers of things they haven't done.  I understand that they have laws to comply with, but it seems there should be some mechanism for the consumer to defend themselves if they are accused of things.
