This isn't a constitutional censorship issue, it's an ethical one. It's an extremely dangerous precedent for private entities that control money and information to censor, and if they aren't rightly reprimanded when they are caught acting as censors, then this sort of thing will become much more common place. Censorship will divide the US even further, and lead to terrible things.

Efficient in what way? Government is probably the least efficient organization someone could invent. Non-profits can be quite efficient, and although I agree with your sentiment as to "who do you trust", at least with non-profits I have a choice in who to who I trust.
