Isn't anonymity a user-generated fallacy in bitcoin? Isn't every coin traceable through the blockchain? Isn't that how government agencies tracked down people using bitcoin like DPR?

Because Bircoin has been expanding and inflationary. Once you can't effectively mine and new coins can't be "created" it's going to be a different story.

An eloquent example of libertarianism.

I'm willing to bet the FBI now has the computer that wallet is on.

Shhhhhh, don't confuse libertarians with facts and the shortcomings of their philosophy.

Needle in a haystack. Plus, SR was only recently on the mainstream radar. Now that it had public popularity, the FBI provided the resources to the agents that were looking at it.

Possible, but if the FBI did they would have used that info to figure out what they needed to make the dominoes fall. You wouldn't see that directly in their case. Easier to backtrack to where you need to start when you know where the end of the road is.

Except Bitcoin is new and adding new currency. No different than firing up the printer presses. No, that won't last forever by design, but for the history of Bitcoin thus far, it's not deflationary. The fluxuation in value Bitcoin has seen is from growth in demand, not from Bitcoin's structure. Biycoin is still too new to feel its structural deflationary forces.

Because the people into Bitcoin for gold-standard like philosophical reasons give Bitcoin a very bad name. People by and large understand why a return to the gold standard and a deflationary system is bad for them.
But people also see why electronic cash that is accepted world wide with no transactional costs is beneficial, especially since it can be used as a secondary currency and is almost anonymous.

Those rich who bought in on bitcoin early? Those ARE the private corruption in normal currency. They're looking for more like minded libertarians so they can rip off people with impunity. They think they've found that with bitcoin.
