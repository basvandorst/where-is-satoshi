Yes it is. It's typical of every company that accepts payment in bitcoin. They don't want to be exposed to price fluctuations and so they convert to fiat at the moment of the transaction. Maybe if Valve was in the business of currency speculation, then they could decide to keep the bitcoin, but they aren't, they're a company that sells games.

There is a way to copy the text you entered in the old claim into the new claim. 
On  login to the system (i used my username and pass of the original claim). This brings you to the 2-step authentication setup page (it does for me at least). Scroll all the way to the bottom to the 'file your proof of rehabilitation claim by the supplementary method' button. Read the warning text. If you use that method then the data you entered in the original claim should be pre-filled in the new form. I haven't tried this yet.

What if you sent money to MtGOX in the days just before  they went down and it never arrived in your account? I know it's been discussed before during the bankruptcy procedure, but is there no chance of recovering that money? 
It must add up to a lot. Where did all that money go? If we can't claim it then someone must have a lot of money that isn't rightfully theirs. Is there a way to track it down?

Why would you want a Xapo card anyway? Let's see, what were the advantages of bitcoin again?
* no third parties - Xapo is the third party because they hold your bitcoins, which means they could choose to not process transactions (e.g. to addresses on a government blacklist) or even seize your bitcoins.It's what happened to Wikileaks a few years ago, people around the world wanted to donate but couldn't because Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and banks wouldn't allow the transactions. Bitcoin finally solved that, let's not go back to the old situation.
* "anonymity" - forget that, before you get your account, Xapo wants your address, phone number, ID card info and more.
* low transaction costs - because of Xapo's fees (they have to make money somehow) it's no cheaper than a normal (fiat) debit card.
With all that, i don't see a reason to get a Xapo card.

They would do it the same way as they do now. Depending on which country you live in, you pay a different amount of bitcoins. They have something like that in Europe already, tier 1 countries and tier 2 countries. Both tiers pay in euros, but prices are lower in tier 2.

Uhm, keep in mind that to successfully execute a 51% attack, you don't need 51% of the hashing power. It's just that with 51% of the hashing power, the attack has a 100% chance of being successful. But even with &lt;51% there's a chance that it would be successful. The less hashing power, the lower the chance of a successful attack. So even with 50% or 49%, the chance of success would still be high, but less than 100% (i've seen percentages somewhere, but i can't remember where).

1) right and wrong
2) right and wrong
e.g. if prices go down, you'll wait until you really need something before buying it (why buy now when you can get it cheaper next week). His conclusion is that that's a bad thing and i (and you) disagree. I think the world would be better off if we wouldn't consume much more than we need.

Because the exchanges follow each other, he would still have most of these advantages even if he traded on a different exchange. 
Now if he would use software that looks for big orders in real-time and buys/sells just before the big order is executed, that would be a different story.

Read the entire post :). He's talking about 94000 btc. 
But i wonder if OP has ever heard of OTC trade? No way are they going to dump 94000 coins on an exchange, that would be stupid.

I was certain that the waiver was already in the previous version.
edit: Seems i was right. The waiver is in the old ToU too, just not at the top like in the new version. Look at the end of section 23 (Arbitration):


So this was already in their ToU in 2015, but they did expand the text to make the details more clear.

It's 3.5% but rising. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:24:05
Aha, so they did update this summer, i thought my memory had gone because the date on the previous version was of 2015. In any case, the part about arbitration (section 23) is the same in the June 2017 and August 2015 versions. [Link to archive](

Yes, borrowers can end the loan any time they want. Lenders on the other hand have to wait until a borrower ends the loan or the time on the loan (that you entered as a lender) runs out.

Why are people hoping it will go that low so they can buy? You've had your chance to buy at that price. If you didn't buy in when it was 8k then that's your own fault. I failed to buy at 3.2k, but I'm not calling for a drop to that level. It would be disastrous for the bullish trend.

Omfg, I was just about to go to bed, logged into my Polo account, saw my balances and panicked. Don't they have some sort of insurance fund for events like this? They're backed by Circle, I thought that meant something. It's supposed to be safer and more legitimate now than before the acquisition.
Okay, now that I've read their message, it's good to know they're actively trying to give us back what we lost. If not, it will take ages to cover the loss with interest from loans alone. I checked, it took me from February 2018 until now to earn the amount that is now missing.

The point that Amichateur was trying to make is, it's not possible at the moment to simply "skip directly to SegWit", the reason being that AsicBoost miners have a financial incentive to vote against SegWit. If you take that incentive away (by fixing AsicBoost), their vote won't be tainted by financial gain and there's a much higher chance of them voting in favor of SegWit.

To know that selling on an exchange will tank the price, you don't have to be a pro. All you need is a working brain. So either he (or whoever is behind the decision) has a malfunctioning brain or this is intentional with the aim to crash the price.

No issue for the people who currently don't hold BTC and are waiting to buy low. But for those who do hold, it's rather unsettling to see their USD value crash.

There would at least be one advantage if the leftover BTC would go to Marc. He at least would be smarter than this idiot trustee and he would hodl it or sell it OTC rather than dump it on an exchange.

If by evolve you mean over time, then [ is a good site. You can see Bitfinex starting to move away from the others on April 14th a little bit, and then a lot on the 17th. 
The reason there's not much arbitrage going on here is that there's currently no way to get your fiat out of Bitfinex. Apparently it's because of the [Taiwanese banks]( but a few people call it the next Mt Gox, so everyone is a bit nervous and trying to get their money out of Bitfinex. Some are even willing to buy the expensive BfxBTC just to be able to transfer their money out, even if it means taking a loss. This is the reason why the price is so high on Bitfinex in the first place. I'm still confident that the bank problems will be resolved. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 09:33:04
According to [this]( Bitfinex had 12% BTC volume in the last 24 hours and 14% in the last 30 days. But i don't think it counts all exchanges. Do you know a more accurate site?

An audit doesn't mean by definition a red flag. Kraken and Coinbase for example have been audited, on their own initiative, to prove their solvency, to reassure their customers and to attract potential customers. A good audit with positive results is a green flag in my opinion.
That said, i don't know how far these audits go. There's a very interesting [article]( from 2014 about what a thorough audit should involve. It should cover at least three areas: crypto reserves, fiat reserves and security. It should also include what the article calls future proofing or forward governance, some form of reassurance that the company is not only healthy now, but will stay that way in the future. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 09:18:44
What's stopping (most) people is the uncertainty surrounding Bitfinex. Some people already call it another MtGox. That's why the price is so high there in the first place, because people bought bitcoin just so they could transfer their money out.

Is that assuming that shorters go short with everything they have? That seems like a terrible idea and bad risk management. If they lose the bet, they lose all their money. Is that sort of trading really common among margin traders?
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:27:10
If they can falsify a summary, they can also falsify a full report. So a full report, to me, doesn't make the results more believable. 
Also, if Friedman is indeed an independent auditor and Bitfinex would just make up a report out of thin air, or would change the conclusion of a real report from unfavorable to favorable, don't you think Friedman would immediately respond to that and expose the lie? They could probably sue bfx for reputation damage in that case. 
That said, i see no reason for bfx to not publish the full report, if only to prevent suspicion. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:07:53

...What, you want proof? Why? You're not providing any. Just like you, I can just accuse any company i want and it magically makes it true.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:08:53


I can't tell if you're a Bitfinex hater or you just don't know what's going on. [This article]( explains the issue. This is not a *Bitfinex* problem, this is a *Taiwanese banks* problem. Every company that uses a Taiwanese bank has the same problem. OKcoin, Xapo, BTC-e and yes, Bitfinex too. 


You seem to think that having your books audited is a sign of trouble. In reality, it's something that exchanges pride themselves on. Customers demand it. It strengthens trust in the exchange. It's a positive sign.

What a ridiculous comparison. A lawyer will do his best to win the case for the plaintiff. An independent auditing firm is neutral. If there are problems with Bitfinex, the auditors will find them, not try to hide them.

"Person A did X which i hated. Now person A does Y. I'm automatically against Y no matter what it is."
So theoretically if Jihan Wu says he's for world peace, you would then be against world peace because of something he did earlier.
Talk about being entrenched.
Both sides want SegWit, only one of them (Core) wants to do it without the support of the economic majority. Blockstream/Core want high fees and a fee market. What user in their right mind would support that? With Segwit2x fees would drop to 2013 levels. I would rather pay 5 cents for a transaction that 5 USD.

No, that was someone in the BU camp. I think it was Jihan Wu (Bitmain) but i would have to verify that. Bitfury has been in the SegWit camp for as long as i can remember. Anyway that was a while ago, now we have two SegWit camps fighting each other. Kind of reminded me of [this picture](
