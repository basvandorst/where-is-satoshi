It is just indicative that bitcoin is being used for speculation rather than any actual use though making it a prime candidate to burst.

It has gone up like 40% in 24 hours. Yiure crazy if you think an equal drop in the opposite direction isnt possible.

Because giant companies running everything is so much better.

I'll never understand people like this. Maybe it's just in my blood to care about society as a whole especially the people at the bottom.

But it isn't like gold. It is like a new mineral that not many people know about yet and is slowly seeping into society. If I found out that a large percentage of the world's supply of it was stolen, I don't know what my confidence in the system would be. Dumping 7% of the world's supply of bitcoins could massively change the price.

I think he is trying to say that people are just in it for themselves to make money and all the bullshit and ideals are a far second if they're even true.

BTC is only used by hardcore idealists and people trying to make money and the people in the second group often pretend to be in the first so they aren't ostracised by the community.

If everyone who disagrees with the hivemind leaves, then it is just an echo of a single opinion leading to things being missed.

'a very unprofitable mistake' This whole thing stinks like an inside job. I'm sure they're laughing all the way to a real bank.

Regulations shouldn't be there to protect irreponsible people from losing their money. They should be there to prevent thiefs from committing criminal acts causing people to lose their money.
Using that logic I assume you're all for removing the police force. I mean if you get robbed, assaulted, raped, or murdered it's your own fault for not protecting yourself adequately.

He's a smart guy trying to get everyone to 'believe' in Bitcoins since he has a metric fuckton of bitcoins still.

Car insurance costs 2400€ a year?..

It's because people don't care about bitcoin as a platform or currency. They only care about it as a get rich quick mechanism.
