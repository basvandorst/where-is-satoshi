user jl777 on bitcointalk forums is apparently working on tech he calls "iguana", which allows you to fully sync in a short time. i don't remember specifics, but it got the attention of some big players in the BTC space

SCAM. I cannot withdraw from that exchange. Support is near non existent and doesn't directly answer any questions

I can't use Gemini in my state, so I have to use CB unfortunately

i don't understand why block size isn't increased as a temporary measure to enable BTC use today while other scaling solutions are being created and implemented for tomorrow

banning internet sites is working great in china. oh wait, people who want to get around it will

they were hacked in the past. maybe look into the details of that hack. i don't know them off the top of my head

is it actually worth it?

ticket still not solved
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:45:49
what if the code has a fatal flaw? isn't that a pretty concerning risk? i am not a programmer, so excuse any possible ignorance
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:58:59
whooooo aaa, we're half way thereeeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2017-01-29 23:13:39
that's a fucking understatement

what does that have to do with legality?

i got in during the dec 2013 peak @ around 1.1k USD..quite happy now
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:22:47
not really. the demand is likely going to continue to increase exponentially and there's a limited supply. if the current supply of BTC was split between every US citizen, each one would get 0.06 BTC.
every institutional investor will have to get BTC in their clients portfolios because it's so hot. they'll lose customers if they aren't able to serve those who want exposure to the crypto market
@_date: 2017-04-23 23:38:24
wait, you're joking?
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:11:02
you are operating an exchange. that is illegal. laws vary depending on where you live. some dudes in florida did that and are now in jail/prison. granted, they had a huge operation going
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:35:59
imagine how much pressure you'd be under by the forces that be if you identified yourself as satoshi. only an idiot would say "hey guys, i'm satoshi" and actually be telling the truth
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:23:21
they've had years to accumulate

Sounds like the drugs doctors dole out like candy
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:13:48
not sure why you had so much BTC on a centralized exchange. you have no one to be upset at but yourself....
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:16:52
if I lose money on a trade, I'll just contact gemini and say I made a mistake. plz reverse it! sounds good? 
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:42:24
i accidently didn't buy bitcoin at 30$ a few years ago. plz reimburse me
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:59:03
after reading tO's homepage, it reads like they are using Bitcoin's chain. So, what's really the deal here?

markets going to keep going down until posts like this disappear. this post is a thermometer and the water isn't yet hot enough to cook a nice meal
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:40:22
if you make enough money where it wouldn't look suspicious, sure. but some people make lots on BTC and are maybe working jobs making 10$/hr. it would look pretty funny if a guy deposited 75k into his bank account over the course of a year making 10$/hr..i would imagine that you'd get flagged
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:15:34
pretty poor decision by gemini. if you fuck up, learn your lesson. they just lost a lot of users
@_date: 2015-11-11 05:16:40
secret  - never sprout certainties regarding bitcoin's price to relatives, friends, associates. you will ultimately look like an ass
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:06:30
this isn't what satoshi wanted!
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:02:46
well it's not helpful that people keep on doing this, which eventually makes its way to mainstream media sources whom blame it on the protocol itself

Government will have to ban internet to stop Bitcoin. Private currencies are a real thing now. Governments cannot stop them, they can only slow down their adoption.

some states might call selling money on localbitcoins illegal if you don't have a money transmitter license. it happens. better to just pay the taxes and get it over with

Waiting over 25 days for withdrawals to go through. After almost 3 weeks someone finally responded to my ticket, though they were completely unhelpful. I replied multiple times and no response yet. It's been 8 days since their first and only contact. 
When I opened the tickets, the funds I was trying to move were worth around 12k USD. ticket  
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:50:12
you have millions on your ledger? cause that's what institutional buyers are going to be doing
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:28:04
what license are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:12:52
AFAIK, it's more than a 1500$ license. you have to have at least 100k of working capital plus a list of other things. it's not so simple from what i've gathered.... otherwise i'd be on LBC making 15-20% on every transaction like some guys have been doing the past few years
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:17:38
it's more complicated than that
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:27:10
eating less and exercising more doesn't always do the trick. often it doesn't. so this energy in energy out thing is not a very useful framework in weight loss programs when discussed in terms of caloric intake/expenditure. the body is significantly more complicated. in a whole, the calorie in/out thing may be true in a very loose way, but not as simply as you put it. the body may keep calories due to physiological deficiencies or abnormalities (ie toxic loads) causing expenditure systems to work improperly. 
I realize this is an article and not a scholarly publication, but they use research to demonstrate the role of gut bacteria in weight loss. maybe some strains of gut bacteria impair nutrient absorption and somehow reduce caloric expenditure, thus seemingly defeating the calories in calorie out thing. but then you can make the argument that it is still true when you look at the human body as an organism not separate from the bacteria which inhabit it. 
so, a lot more complicated

if you're advanced, you might not get much from it. but if you're intermediate, it might clarify some sticking points you have about cryptocurrency

Currently have around 11k-12k USD frozen on poloniex. Opened a ticket 2 weeks ago and haven't gotten a response. I tried to make withdrawals but they are stuck on "awaiting approval" and now Polo wants level 3 verification for me to do anything. I have received no contact from Polo. If any Polo staff is reading this please help. ticket
