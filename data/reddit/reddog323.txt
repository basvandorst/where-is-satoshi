Good advice.

That’s a good attitude to take. I’m betting you’d probably get more out of a 5 star meal or a good evening with someone special anyway. I wouldn’t get one, even if I had the means. I’d be too afraid of wrecking it. I’d be more inclined to get something cheap, like a Plymouth 300 C or V6 Charger and mod it with a supercharger, or find a decent classic car that needs some work and restore it from the ground up.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:33:41
Yep, but it’s still up overall. For now anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:45:09
Any advice for a noob about to jump in? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:46:04
Mind blowing, isn't it? Five years ago, that headline wouldn't have been possible. The future is here...

Time to ditch my iPad. Apple is going to get eaten alive over this. Not now...but in 5-6 years when bit coin is being accepted everywhere.
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:01:23
Makes sense. Sorry for the misinterpretation.

If you have good credit, the deals on new cars are crazy right now. 0% APR financing, etc. I'd still want to put down a sizable downpayment. If you have dime investments, check with your financial guy. You might be able to cover the payments with interest you're earning.

And people with iPads that autocorrect...
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:20:57
Ah, *this* is genius, and just what’s needed. I expect it will be a best seller once word gets around.
@_date: 2019-08-01 04:26:45
What would you recommend for someone just starting out, with not a lot to invest? I plan on starting out small, and to keep pushing.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:38:19
Good man. You did the right thing. I would have given it back too.
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:48:18
It’s a good bet for now, but I have issues putting all my eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2019-08-04 08:38:15
If Brexit and the interest retreat drop doesn’t kick it off, I’d say at least another year. It will be a bad one when it happens, though. Maybe 1929 again....and I don’t see the government being inclined to bail anyone out again. They may not even have the means.

Link to a wiki? Google searches for “stack stats bitcoin” brought back a bewildering mix of results.
@_date: 2015-09-06 23:50:24
Nope. Updated Java recently and now it doesn't work. Period. Going to take it in to the shop to figure out what happened.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:18:56
This is trippy. I can't wait until the real estate market starts accepting bitcoins..
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:17:18
[i instantly thought of this.](
Oddly enough, it's raining cats and dogs right now..
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:12:00
Don't know how that happened. Thanks for the heads up..
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:30:09
Ahh. Thank you. Both of those would be enough to do it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:35:54
I think you're headed in the right direction. I don't have much coding experience, but would like to help in any way possible.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:21:51
It's a significant amount of money for anyone...
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:36:07
The only way this could be more amusing is if that stick had a sharp end..
Edit: what did happen anyway? I haven't been checking the boards lately, and last time I checked, it was around US $230..
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:09:25
Meh. I didn't get my first email until I was 23 and in grad school. The only way to access it at the time was through the dumb terminals in the computer lab, where, incidentally, I learned about MUDs and MOOs. First decent computer I had was in '94' an original Pentium running Windows 95.
Edit: posted this using an iPad. Time marches on...
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:36:12
Looks like the future is here. :) 
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:52:09
So I guess the party is over? At least in the US?
Additionally, I've been subscribed for six months, and understand bitcoin even less than I did then.
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:32:49
Well done. I'm hoping I have enough to invest during the next cycle..
