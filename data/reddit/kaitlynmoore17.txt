This is a welcome discussion point.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Buy low, sell high, it seems so simple but most investors still don't seem to get it :-) This is quite an interesting website I found:   I don't know any other site that gives such good inisghts in the team, the product, advisors, community, the business and the business model, etc. Check:  To check  Bitcoin Detailed report.

Very good blog. Good to see I'm not the only one who thinks like this. There's a lot of exchanges out there. I found that coinmarketcap.com gives quite a decent overview.  I found this great website:  Since I use this site I make so much less basic investment mistakes.  Check for example:   To watch Bitcoin Investment research.

Interesting post. Good to see I'm not the only one that is thinking about this. The amount of scammy coins out there that get blind 10m+ usd investments are facinating to me.  I was wondering if anyone of you uses:   This site is really helpful in my coin research. I don't know any other sites with so much indepth analysis.
