Yo guys I know that you guys want the price to be pumped up and etc... but this should be the last thing, there's a lot of things to work on bitcoin, reduce the fee, be more stable, fix the privacy etc... without all this the original idea or concept of bitcoin is falling apart, you only want to pump up the price and get rich, that's not the point of all of this... we want BTC as a global currency not as an easy trading platform.

@_date: 2019-08-27 18:36:32
Is there any link or smth that I can see deeply pls? Would like to give it a look

Satoshi doesn’t have 10 billion fortune, see the genesis block. Why everyone says this? I don’t get it.
Edit 1: 
As far as I know the metodology used to know how much coins does Satoshi Have is not perfect and is speculative. 
First 
“Our analysis is far from perfect and we used a variety of methods [...] We will have made many errors and we do not claim our methodology is robust or scientific. However, as far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to allocate every block in 2009 as belonging to the apparent single entity or not,”
“far less robust than many have assumed.”
“Each miner is not independent, in the sense that they are likely to be running the same software or could be using the same popular hardware, which could produce the same pattern.”
 
“According to BitMex 600.000-700.000 is a better estime” Everything is based on assumptions. 
The only thing we now 100% is that Satoshi owns 68 bitcoins.
Edit 2:
Seems like I was wrong.
Thanks to the user bit_LOL to post the link that deeply analyse the coins that Satoshi owns

I remember the reward was 50 bitcoins and during the time he had reached 68 bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:18:19
Satoshi only have 70 bitcoin in the main address, when he recieved the genesis block reward , but people started to increment the genesis reward after cloning bitcoin. You can find this info in any bitcoin block chain explorer.

Then by the rules of this sub reddit this post should be banned, until that, u are wrong
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:19:41
The poll revelates information to this sub and can tell us what does people knows about bitcoin and his tech. It’s relevant to ask that and clarify what’s it. Probably you don’t know for what purpose you use pos or pow for example.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:27:21
Try to search about the groups 121 and 180. And if u did research you will know why crypto will be the future.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:39:34
Oh i got it, u don’t understand what’s the main objective of pos. And why hater ethereum? By pos i mean proof of stake.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:39:59
U are just a 0 trying to become smth. My sneaky operation, what the fck? Just go outside you need it. Thinking to much in btc will affect you
@_date: 2019-04-09 23:10:04
U think you are right because u are retarded af, dunno why u keep saying ethereum lol. It's a fcking poll asking people to know what they know about differents aspects, even if u dont get it or u think that pos should not be in the poll (just ur opinion even if bitcoin in future adopts pos). Just stfu lol, u are annoying af fcking 10yold
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:06:40
That’s just your opinion, just stop being so dramatic it’s just a fcking poll holy fck
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:52:29
As well it says up " I will put some polls about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. "
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:23:03
Don’t think this infantile, I think ur comment is infantile instead of helping you are just attacking, that’s quite immature. This poll can tell me what does the r/bitcoin knows and what I can do next. As well in what I can focus for a marketing strategy for example. This poll is limited by your imagination like dose from economics forums. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2019-04-10 02:25:44
U keep replying xd
