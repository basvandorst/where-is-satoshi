You could also help much more directly by giving your money to a charity or cause that you research and agree with the scope and impact of.
Which would be much more efficient.  What with no government bureaucratic overhead.

You dont give because the government does it "for you."  Yet in the same breath you talk about how unequal the results are.
So, instead, pick one person, decide if their plight is something they really are trying to get out of, or if their decisions are self sabotaging.  Help those who want to help themselves.  When theyre doing a little better, help another person.  Repeat.

I think the act of government taking money "from everybody" to "help everybody" is costly, not just in monetary value, but in the way we choose to view charity.  
The poster I responded to is a perfect example.  He feels his moral duty to help others is being fullfilled by a third party.  Yet he complains at the outcome.  So many do this.  You, as an individual cannot help millions, but you can help,much more effectively, one or two people who really, genuinely need help, and in doing so, can help them to a point where they can hopefully do the same for others.

Lol, this would be funny if it didn't come across as so sincere.


Fixed that for you.
Back on topic, Venezuela is something that should be in everybody's radar.  There are a lot of lessons to be learned about preparing for the entirety of a country's decline, as it suicides itself.  Bitcoin is a legitimate part of a well balanced exit strategy, but the reality is, that you will need food, water and basic medical and sanitation supplies long before you need to border hop with your seed words memorized.

You should.  You, as a person, should always keep at least a fractional amount of your emergency fund on hand, in cash.  Banks close down, atms empty in emergencies.  
There is, and there should not be, absolutely anything suspicious about having cash, and using cash in your day to day life.

I love that article.
"Fuck these guys for [trying to keep as much of the money they earn as possible in an area with extremely high taxes and livong costs].  I hope they get fucked by the IRS."

This, but unironically.

Because the Israelites werent one of the original tribes of the region, eh?
We get it, it sucks that the Brits just drew some lines on a map and said "Jews go there," and its been causing problems all through the middle east ever since, but that doesnt excuse foreign aid money going directly to bomb the israelis.

So how do you deal with both at the same time, for the average, non investor?  They get raped on the front end and the back end?
