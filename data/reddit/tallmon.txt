No I am not. I am assuming he wants cusotomers and most customers are in places that have to comply with those law and regulations.  I assume he's not setting up in North Korea.

Why did you transfer USD instead of buying with USD? If you buy directly from your bank account it locks in the price at the time that you initiate the purchase. Who cares if it takes a week to get out of pending - you're locked in.

When there is a fork it splits the chain into the existing chain and a new chain. Your wallet will be on both chains. If you control your wallet you can claim the new coins. If it's on an exchange you don't control your coins on the block chain. The exchange does. Google Bitcoin December forks for more information.

Dude, a real trazor appears to be tamper proof. I can make one that looks like it and has fake instructions in it telling you how to give a bad guy your coin. Just lake the fake wallet website that ends in .org - looks authentic and generates real keys and also sends them to the bad guy.

I hope everyone reads this as  a PSA. If you transfer money via credit card or PayPal it is completely electronic and can be verified quickly.  If you do a wire transfer it is completely manual on the receiving side. The company has to look at their account and manually decipher where the money came from. If the volume of transfers suddenly increased by 10x and they don't have the staff then it's going to take 10x as long to match the transactions.

Simple answer: make sure your btc are in your own wallet that you control the keys/passphrases.  After the forks you can the claim them.
Long answer: specific instructions depend on the wallet you are using.
- AFTER the target fork, create a second wallet and send your btc to the second new wallet. This will be your new permanent btc wallet.
- open your old wallet that had the btc.  Get the keys that had the coins.
- find a wallet that supports the altcoin and create said wallet.
- go to the altcoin wallet, do a "sweep" providing the keys from the prior step
- done
If you need more detailed help google how to claim bitcoin cash from back in November.  There are hundreds of how to's.
Depending on how long you had your btc for you can claim bitcoin gold now!

I very well know why it was expensive.   
Someone could come up with a process for making gold.  We can find a mammoth deposit obliterating it's value.  We can mine an asteroid who's core is solid gold. etc etc.   Today's far fetched ideas might not seem far fetched in the future.
In 2000 gold was about $10k for kg, in 2011 it was $58k per kg, now it's $40k per kg.
Gold will rise and fall just like everything else that we place value on based on supply/demand and many other factors.

You you have to use the exhange you're using for the price. For private trades, same rules. Mark to market. I can take a physical stock certificate and sign the back over to someone else. That's still a taxable event and I'd have to take the closing price of the trading day. For Crypto, make a reasonable effort to be correct.

Thank, I posted the same above. All you needs is quit claim, sign over the title, notarize and file at town hall. It's traditional to list 1$ as the price if you don't want to disclose it publicity. As a buyer, I would pay for a title search to check for liens and such.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:27:24
None of what you are saying would impede you from buying property with Bitcoin or peanuts or whatever.
