You mean DOWN to 0.0000001?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:41:00
Dude! That is some quality work!
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:34
Yes, please do!
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:12:32
Yup $10, 
Simple math 
If Bitcoin was @ 10000 dollar and Billy has 100 dollars, how much bitcoin can Billy buy?
100/10000 = 0.01 
Billy can buy 0.01 bitcoin
Now, how much would Billy make if bitcoin would to go up to 11000?
Answer: 
1000 x 0.001= 10
Billy would make $10 if he can do simple math.

I hear you, but I don’t think it’s too late for bitcoin though
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:38:39
Wow, that just blew my mind! And I’m sitting here thinking I am pretty smart for always setting a stop loss.

That’s good and all, but it would be dumb if you vote for him solely because he is pro bitcoin.
You would want someone to be able to run a country not a full node!

You, my friend, are getting downvoted!
@_date: 2019-02-18 05:56:05
I appreciate your manners and willingness to have an educated discussion. 
If you are asking about why people are using Bitcoin, then I can’t tell you  for sure,  other than that everyone have their reasons, incentives, or agendas. For just about anything. So we can’t really generalize that everyone have a bad or good incentives.
However, if you want to understand what bitcoin is and why do we need it? Then, I suggest you watch this historic speech about Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos in the link below:
Have a good one!

I know a lot is goin on in this picture, but did you notice the Crypto Beach hotel?
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:09:30
Wrooong, this is called “The Chinese FUD”
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:24:55
Damn! That was a good video. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:09:59
I never realized that 300 was all about the HODLERS until now! Makes you wonder, you know?

I posted this over three hours ago, and it’s just showing up now.
At the time of posting, there was only one post with 6666.00 not 6666.66.
On a side note, and with all respect, if you don’t like a post or you’ve seen it before, simply downvote it. No need to be salty with strangers.

This man has dreams, this man has goals, and bitcoin could help him achieve them faster!
Smart man! best of luck brother.

You are subbed to a bitcoin subreddit on your first day on Reddit? 
Nice, I think we are due for a big bull run then!
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:54:44
Oh yeas, should we get the “Eleven” meme ready?
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:17:36
Please don’t!
But if you do, I will get the “Eleven” meme ready!
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:01:56
I wonder how they could afford that if they are HODLing? Does that mean that they were rich already from before crypto and they are in it now for the technology ? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:58:10
You are right. However, bitcoin is getting less volatile with time and regulations.
Crypto markets are still the Wild West, but not as wild as 2015 or 2011.
I appreciate your comment.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:29:05
Can we please stop posting about “Price increase” and “bull runs”?
The price will increase when no one is expecting it to, the bull run will come when most people aren’t expecting it. 
You are not going to be rich just by holding $500 or $5000 worth of crypto.
In the meantime , keep accumulating and educate your self. The longer the bear market lasts, the richer you will be in the next bull run.
The only logical reasons that could bring new investors (average Joes, baby boomers, etc) would be the next reward halving, which will happen around May of 2020.
Average investors don’t understand bank adoptions or lightning network, they understand half the reward means double the price. It’s an easy concept to understand and to explain.
They will put their money to double it, will make more that 2x in a short time, tell their friends, and their friends will tell their family and relatives, wich will, all together, trigger a bull run.
How do I know you ask? I know because that’s what happened in the past, I know because that’s how I got into crypto, I know because that’s how most of the crypto OGs made their money if you listen to their interviews.
Be patient and accumulate.
Edit: changed time for next halving from 2019 to 2020. Thanks for the person who corrected me.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:52:30
You are right! I will correct it. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:39:18
I have no problem with being wrong about that.
That means more money for all of us!
