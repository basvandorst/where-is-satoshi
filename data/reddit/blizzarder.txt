Would you rather have a bionic arm or a bionic leg?

Yes, they do.  It's not scalable though long term which is why the sidechain concept is so awesome.
Also - I always get downvoted when I say anything against Mastercoin/Counterparty/Alts, it's predictable.  It's as if people have a vested interest in Bitcoin not succeeding...

Probably because he owns Litecoin

Trying to work out where your accent is from.  There's definitely a hint of Bristol but it's not a Bristol accent.  I'd say somewhere between Swindon and Reading.

It worked in the Dark Sun AD&amp;D campaign setting, why not Bitcoin?

Brock Pierce is the guy in charge of Sunlot right?  Anybody had any dealings with him?

It's not really changing the rules all that much, it's just a new opcode to freeze Bitcoins until they get unfrozen.  The how/when they get unfrozen is the complicated bit, but it's an optional process that won't affect the majority of Bitcoin holders.
I really don't think they missed the boat.  Adam Back, who built hashcash that Bitcoin was partly based upon missed the boat?  I hope not for his sake.  No, I think they simply had a really good idea with sidechains that would help Bitcoin in the long run.
Introducing sidechains to goverments, corporations, that's good for Bitcoin holders too.  The profit motive here is securing Bitcoin's success, not trying to make consulting dollars by changing the Bitcoin protocol.

Yeah, ok, maybe being just a slight bit inflammatory.
The issue is that there's no incentive to move to a side-chain because the value of Mastercoin/Counterparty is in their underlying currency.  That would cease to exist on a sidechain because of the two-way pegging mechanism.
Surely a sidechain could be created that keeps the value of everybody's old currency in much the same way that they work right now (public keys store a secondary balance).  Maybe there's a way it could be done.
But anyway, right now there's no reason for them to move from piggybacking upon the Bitcoin blockchain.  Since the concepts behind Mastercoin and Counterparty can be duplicated and improved upon (the piggybacking does impose some limitations), somebody's going to come along and fork them as a sidechain.  When that happens what would become of everybody's Mastercoins and XCP?  The value would slowly move towards zero.
The blockchain is a scarce resource though.  At some point the cost of using it is going to cost more than using a sidechain.  This would put Mastercoin and Counterparty at a big disadvantage.

Maybe he spent all the money on a stamp and sent himself a postcard from Cyprus.
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:55:36
Yeah, you're right.  I did about 2 minutes more research and came to the same conclusion.  They're just using Mastercoin as a temporary intermediate step.

Sidechains aren't a leech on the system, they strengthen Bitcoin, give it a whole lot more use-cases and stop it being overtaken by a successor coin, ie. Ethereum.
So what if they want to make money from starting a Bitcoin Blockchain company?  Their interests are aligned with the Bitcoin community as a whole (most of which are invested in Bitcoin's success)

Thank you.  The downvote brigade are rife in this thread, I did my best to combat their attacks.
Apparently Brock had a games company making apps for Facebook too, they worked on some poker game which didn't make any money and then laid all the staff off (after making them work for worthless shares for a few weeks).
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:02:26
I don't think Bitcoin companies need as much money as other industries... for instance Biotech.  
Although saying that, Bentleys are pretty expensive.

Are they planning to implement trading features that will allow them to be competitive with newer exchanges (ie. Kraken), and if so, when?
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:11:43
Can't they wait for sidechains?  All this mastercoin crap is going to spam the blockchain more than SatoshiDice did.

Just because it's a dichotomy doesn't mean it's false.

u with the handle means "uter" or "under", basically meaning a very small number (one that can also be negative).

Thanks for that, great to learn more aboat Bitcoin.

British people are too boring and stuffy to get excited by something like Bitcoin.  Source - I am one.
