Not sure if this issue has been raised but lots of people see bitcoin as an investment, something they care nothing for apart from if the value goes up or down. Inevitably the value will go up if all the issues in OP's post are addressed but I have a feeling people aren't willing to wait and the longer bitcoin takes to fix these issues the less momentum it will have.

Ha, my Dad always uses the tulip analogy for this when I talk about it.
I want to believe in crpyto but I think at this point, especially within my inner circle of friends BTC has become some gold of our generation that is just going to keep rising and rising regardless of if it is used for its intended purpose...
The hype machine is a wonderful thing, but it it gets to the point where it only harms the currency. At least it helps fuel the technology (I think?). I hear Bitcoin discussed daily; work, uni etc but nobody is talking about the tech or uses. It is all I made X in Y amount of time, I am gonna be rich!

For Bitcoin to work/continue to grow it needs to be ACCESSIBLE, this means you don't tell someone they are a dumb fuck for not knowing how it all works and how best to use it... You wouldn't call a foreigner who didn't quite understand your currency a dumb fuck now would you?
If I had all the time in the world I would definitely look at Bitcoin as a payment method seriously and get more involved but posts like this put me and I'm sure many others even touching the currency, chill out and educate others!
