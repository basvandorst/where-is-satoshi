Bitcoin 0.11? ore 1.01?
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:59:46
Than this sound's like a very good argument for government to embrace bitcoin. It's like getting a big chunk of profit for them.
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:15:39
If this passes, and Winklevoss Etf and if Bitlicense will be more ar less startup friendly, this will defently will be a very positive push for the next  big bitcoin wave.

To think about it , from an a briliant idea 5 years ago to what do we have now, you just can't say anything bad about bitcoins future! 
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:19:27
Yea right, maybe in the past when only some can afford all this printing tehnology it was good...
@_date: 2014-12-21 14:13:06
nevermind him, he is just trolling...
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:26:07
I made that only to enforce my believe to bitcoin, i just run out of things that can change my mind about it...
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:43:37
fanx about onename.io didnt know about them
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:26:11
Hey guys maybe he knows more than we need to know, even he againts bitcoin, I can bet that he brougt some. If I was in his place, with so much money laying around, for me will be nothing to buy some 1000btc just for fun of it...
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:57:29
but in the end everyone know is dollars...
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:58:22
WOW Dude, can you imagine your visualization in are Video presentation type lesson about Bitcoin infrastructure and skillet principal!
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:34:25
I mean, We do know that BItcoin in 5 years could be like 50k$ for example... but about this potentially could know very little people in comparison from the global scale. So right now price is irrelevant if thinking long term...
ps. is hard for me to explain in my 3rd language :) 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:59:47
too low when? 250$ 150$ 50$ 1$ ? (i am just currious, mothing more :) )
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:25:05
Agreed 
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:44:42
I know they are! but for a lot of people Laziness get in there way :)
if would only be some cheap box node ready device...
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:44:56
You just miss-spelled the μBTC with BTC :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:17:28
Only from those addresses whose were created by a certain date...so No one could do that you described...
So if you got 1 mil BTC , you still can vote only once!
ps. We always could implement a side-chain for future more complicated voting system...
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:42:48
Yes for sure, but look to the whole picture... Halving I just a piece of it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:08:30
I'am trying :)
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:09:05
Then Bitcoin is immortal :) 
ps. I mean if Bitcoin Drops to in next 2 weeks down to 230$ I would borrow 10kof $ to from my neighbors to buy BTC for knowing for sure that I will double that money. (and of course knowing the whole picture of the situation of the markets and Infrastructure ), and I am pretty sure that people like me are some quit are lot :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:01:04
my computer its too damn loud and  powerconsumption is high
@_date: 2015-01-02 03:40:40
sorry my bad, I am new Here :) 
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:24:43
Because gold doesn't trade by tons vs usd
And we still will use fiat currency for the next 5-10 years 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:38:47
Yes... Hey this are just some thought of mine, is not like I am getting a project tomorrow based on this :)
I just like to discuss on different things about what Bitcoin could serve for us... and I just sad that this could be just a Test, anyway a whole new voting system will be on side-chain or something...
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:49:06
They will sapmple a DNA code from your hairs cells and make this as a Seed for a Bitcoin Wallet, or something way BIGGER like International DNA Personal and Uniq Idetification based on a ultra secures block/side chain protocol...
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:26:39
I am just an Bitcoin entuziasmant like you, I just like to share my thoughts about bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:30:15
ok.. than If we do implement we could put a time frame limit like for 1 mounth ago... or 1 year ago :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:39:09
Oh nice, those guys did a really god job, but they are still centralized
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:37:04
Is important, but not always, for example when Bitcoin will saturate the market, and the price will be balanced, than price will not be so much important... 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:14:25
It is not a secret that one of the most powerful sentiment that human kind has is "Greed" , even though we all like the Bitcoin Idea, nobody will back up from making some good profit by knowing something about a thehnological trend that only 0.1% of planet knows... 
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:25:11
And we could make a global network for total control of the trust of the system, by knowing that only one person per nod could rezolve those puzzles. 
And It doesnt matter are you rich or pure, big or small, we know for sure that averybody get to have equal power of the network.

So what, ISIC hardware manufactures are not so many anyway and you put only open source softwear...
