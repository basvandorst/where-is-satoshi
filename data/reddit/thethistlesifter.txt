This could be a tipping point for bitcoin!
Pun aside though, this could be similar to when porn chose bluray over HD, and won bluray the battle!

Thanks for the heads up.
Baby Oil is not really ideal for a man's face, and might smell a bit dainty. But if you want to try and make your own to see the difference, there are many different blogs that explain what carrier oils to use to give it a whirl.

Small bars and restaurants are notoriously slow for picking up new ways of business, especially technologies.
Now think of how hard it would be to convince a 50 something year old owner who can barely read emails to use this "digital currency" that has no tangible value.

Yep great discussions about piracy, privacy, rights leading in to the future, bitcoin and the dark net.

They laughed at Louis Armstrong when he said he was gonna go to the moon. Now he's up there, laughing at them.

[Electrum GUI Concept](

This design concept is pretty well copied from the Avast Control Panel. How did they manage to do it if you're saying it can't be done?

Totally agree, so I decided to redesign Electrum 2.0. It's based off the look of the Avast control panel. I honestly think with this much of an upgrade to the GUI, it would attract and retain more users, and people would be more likely to spread the wonderful world of bitcoin!

[Design Concept Electrum
(please don't pay any attention to alignment, values or any other specificities, it's just a mockup I made in 20mins).](
The point is, there's great room for improvement with what appears to be minor front end changes. I'd happily take on any official Electrum work for free as well!
