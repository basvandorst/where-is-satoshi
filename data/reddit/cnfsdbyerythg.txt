Yea....perhaps... I would have expected more from a tech centric blog like engadget :(

The stock market grows at around 7-9 percent annually..Does that stop people from spending money....what a silly argument.
A stable asset that can not be inflated or deflated by government authority / A monopoly (see diamonds) is a very valuable thing indeed.

The purpose of my post was to inform the community of a serious bug and correspondingly serious lack of timely support on the GDAX (coinbase) platform.  The hope is that my r/bitcoin brethren can be well informed in order to make better decisions on which trading platforms to trust with their money.  Perhaps my lake of business acumen is only matched by your lack of knowledge as to the purpose of message boards.

Well losing access to funds due to a site bug is not something i would classify as normal business.  This is compounded on a trading platform where access to fund is the entire point of the platform.

thats not exactly true.  This outsider seems to think that deflation is the Achilles heel of bitcoin and then uses spurious logic as proof.  The argument that if something is deflationary is stops people from wanting to spend money is silly.   (edited for spelling)

Well its only 100 bucks....But at least others on Reddit can be forewarned that using GDAX may be risky.

They finally reached out and fixed.  Good resolution but a little slower then i would have hoped.  Thanks Coindesk.

I think pretty much everything written by you on this thread can be best summed up as curmudgeonly.  Thanks for your contribution.
