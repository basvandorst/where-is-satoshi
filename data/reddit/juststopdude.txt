Sure....whatever. commodities make great currencies...
The fact that over 75% of the total number of bitcoin s ever in existence are in the hands of a fewer than a dozen people, that the network is completely centralized in China in the hands of a few, and the technical problems cannot be addressed in a timely fashion....Yup...currency of the future.

If you are a net exporter of goods, you desire a weaker local currency compared to the currency that your customer is using to pay you. 
This is why Japan likes having a Yen weaker than the Euro and USD. Same with China. Same with pretty much any net export country. 
Utilizing a deflationary currency negates that benefit and hurts the export economy. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:48:28
The US has had localized currency, both on the state level and in the private sector, in the past.  
But lets look at a larger pool of people, with vastly different standards of living, say like the Euro...where Germany and Greece use the same currency, pegged at the same value. 
Yeah that is going great for Greece isn't it?
So we force that standard beyond the EU to include the entire world. We had a an example for world history where a global currency was rapidly deflating. 
Post WWII, the US found itself in a unique position were it was the sole nation on earth where its manufacturing capacity was neither destroyed (Europe, Asia), or severely disrupted (England and Russia). The value of the dollar was rising so rapidly that Western nations would take US dollars and rather than spend it, hold it in reserve as its value continued to rise. 
The net concern with this was that eventually the global economy, already struggling to restart on consumer production was going to collapse. The dollar, with its increasing value would suddenly become worthless as a currency. Everything was going to be locked up. 
Hence why the US came up with the Marshall Plan. The US would freely give US dollars to participating countries, but they were required to spend said dollars. 
Were we to go to a global, single currency that was deflationary in nature, people would hoard it and localized black market would form using other means of currency, such as barter, or illegal local currencies.

Bitfinex cannot return the funds back to all the customers they ripped off. If you think it will happen, you are crazy. 
People have already traded their IOU-coins, ergo there are victims that will never get their funds back. And there is nothing to stop Bitfinex from refusing to honor the IOU's. All they have to do is change up their user agreement again on the fly. 
What I suspect they will do is something along the lines of not honor debt coins that have changed hands.

I think a major roadblock in the way of bitcoin getting mass acceptance is from the community itself. We struggle to try and see the use of bitcoin out of our own frame of reference. 
As a business owner, bitcoin at this time does not offer me any benefits over traditional banking means, and furthermore, has some serious downsides. Non-reversible transactions would leave me at a severe disadvantage to my suppliers. My tax situation would become much more complex. And frankly, the majority of users seem to care more about increasing the value of bitcoin over spending it and increasing usage. 
Per the US debt, the vast majority of US debt is owned by US citizens, states, and local governments. One of the things that makes me laugh about Trump claiming he is going to force the the creditors of US debt to take a haircut is he is literally saying he is going to fuck over the people voting for him. The fact that China owns something like 8% of US debt would make them more inclined not to encourage the US of a non-USD currency. 
This is part of the disconnect I see when people on assume that a deflationary currency is necessarily good. A high USD versus other currency kills US exports. The other frustrating disconnect I see here is the assumption that the banking industry does not change with technology or time. This is not true at all. If anything, bitcoin is effectively starting over the banking industry and ignoring hard learned lessons...which is why we see the same frustratingly low tech scams again and again. 
Per the NSA or another branch of the US government actively fucking with bitcoin at this time, I just don't really see the point. There is any number of ways they could derail it at a later time without involving purchasing bitcoin. One of the problems with bitcoin is that so few coins actually move in meaningful amounts that any single whale could cause a major price drop. Find a single whale, do an audit or something along those lines to force a whale to sell a bunch of coins and the bottom falls out. 
In my opinion, the blockchain has a future...its just that bitcoin is not that future necessarily. There are too few people sitting on far too many coins. The deflationary nature leads to problems (such as Greece where they cannot inflate their currency and lessen their economic dysfunction). To be clear, I am not saying that inflation is necessarily good. What you want is a predictable amount of inflation to encourage long term investment in an economy. Deflation tends to gridlock the economy until only base consumption is met. And while the claim that de-centralized is good, must like deflation, I would not say this is always true. Bitcoin, in its present format, struggles with making any real time adjustments. It take far too long to come up with any sort of consensus.
Ah but I am rambling. I am far from being an expert in anything and I appreciate the time and effort you made in this conversation.  
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:37:15
A couple of quick things...
1) Never said that bitcoin was dead nor that its primary use is for illegal activities. My stance has always been that it struggles to replace banking services for people that have access to legitimate banking services. 
2) I highly recommend that you don't do the "I'm gonna go through someone's comment history and act really creepy" as a discussion tool. It tends to do more harm than good in a discussion.
3) Methinks your knowledge of serving in the military will be on par with your experience in the business world...which should be hilarious. Please...fill me in Captain Military on what its like to serve.

 About 31.8 million U.S. consumers had their credit cards breached in 2103. Lets assume that the total number of consumers with credit cards in the US at that time was 242,470,820 which is based on 2013 census data. Let's round that number to just 200 million for folks that don't have a credit card. 
That is around 16% of the banking population of the US (which the US leads the world in credit fraud), being affected by hacking. 
There is no way in hell anyone can attempt to make the claim that a smaller percentage of the bitcoin universe is affected by fraud, specifically hacking. Add in the fact that the only response that many victims get in the bitcoin world is "sorry for your loss", choosing bitcoin over a credit card due to fraud concerns makes as much sense as choosing to ride a bicycle on a 6 lane highway because one is scared of cars.

The only benefit to use bitcoin over traditional banking services is situations were you cannot get traditional banking services...so like gambling, child porn, drugs, illegal weapons, under served legitimate consumers.
For legitimate purposes, there is not a single situation where a bitcoin would be better than say a credit card. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:18:15
What would they lose? For all we know, they themselves are buying up the debt, which would not be that far off what they were already doing by allowing employees to gamble on bitfinex. 
I am constantly amazed that as long as someone involves bitcoin, people will justify any and all kinds of illegal behavior in a company. The fact that bitfinex could do this shit in the first place is a massive reason why wide spread use of bitcoin is not happening. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 18:09:57

@_date: 2016-04-23 17:37:10
I'm confused...
I will reiterate my point to try and clarify my position. You initial supposition was, and feel free to correct me if I have made concept errors here, that in the event of a complete failure of the USD, and just the USD, that credit card companies and consumers would naturally transition to bitcoin.
My supposition to that is no, for a variety of reasons, primarily because consumers are creatures of habit. Even pretending that the bitcoin ecosystem could handle that many transactions, people would naturally turn to a currency they are more comfortable with. So let's pretend the USD dies so we all switch over to the British Pound. I think that is more likely due to human nature and the current restrictions on the network than everyone just going to bitcoin.

I don't you understand the situation. Members of the royal family are not allowed to just leave whenever they want. Their travel is tightly controlled. Furthermore, they never leave with family. 
The government will always have your wives and children. If you are not there, they will be brutally tortured in your place. Anyone that you have ever done business with or have had contact with will be tortured. 
How exactly would you be able to escape the kingdom? Do you think Qatar, UAE, Oman....they are going to open their borders and give you shelter? They have the same political system and no one will provide aid to royal lines that have fell from power. It would destabilize their own regime. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:36:41

Typically in Arabic nations, there will be a succession crisis from time to time. Basically the extended royal family (and it will be massive) breaks off into two or more branches with their own candidates they wish to put to the thrown. 
Back in the day, usually the losing side was killed off to the man. Today, they get pushed out of office and their assets seized. 
Its very important to note that in the UAE, everything is royal family property. So these very rich princes were rich not because of any great intelligence or hard work...just pure luck were they had control of the government purses. 
Well they backed the wrong sides and now their assets are seized. 
The idea that bitcoin would prevent this is hilarious. It is just as easy to torture someone for bitcoin access as it is for their other financial access. 
And the reason why these men have turned their finances over is because they would have been slaughter with their families after being tortured.

Long term, bitcoin is going to be replaced by another crypto-currency. Expecting bitcoin to be the end all be all is crazy. I think there are inherent problems with the bitcoin community that prevent bitcoin from being able to adapt rapidly enough. Everything becomes a massive controversy with bitcoin in terms of forks. Instead of having an internal process of creating and approving changes, it comes off as a massive twitter battle of people shouting at each other. Its grossly inefficient. 
What I expect to happen, and I could be perfectly wrong, is that a large entity like google, with resources and a clear power structure, will jump into the area based on the limited success of bitcoin. 
The big problem with bitcoin is that your grandma can't easily use it. And as much as we like to imagine that everyone is just like us, with the same experience and expertise in using it, that simply isn't true. We represent a tiny fraction of the potential consumer market. The investment to getting into bitcoin, through time and prep is just too difficult at this time compared to traditional banking means in the US and the rest of the Western World. 
There is just too much baggage with the  "bitcoin" name and community and that's assuming people even know what "bitcoin" is. Again, we think its everywhere because we intentionally expose ourselves to it. In reality, most people in the US barely have heard of the term before...let alone know how to set up a wallet and use it safely.

Exactly. And we end up with a serious conundrum...(is that spelled correctly?...We aren't talking about changing bugs here. We are talking potentially fundamental changes.  
Rapid evolution would require a pretty centralized system. You don't want changes simply being released and hope for the best. You a dedicated organization. 
But that is the opposite of what most users claim they want. They want decentralization without any formal controls. 
With any changes, you got winners and losers. And as shows, the bitcoin community can be downright dysfunctional at times. I don't want to be a dick, but honestly I think its the community that is the biggest roadblock to bitcoins' success at times.

I think a more interesting idea would be to have half lives, similar to radioactive isotopes, on bitcoins. 
Hot potato that shit. The longer you hold onto the damn things, the less they are worth. As the network gets updated, coins are given to miners to replace the amount that has decayed. 
So you get the deflationary nature that for some fucking reason, the libertarian element in seems determined to maintain despite it causing a host of problems, while at the same time, receiving the benefits of inflation, which forces people to invest and use the coins vice holding onto them pointlessly. 
Even better, it keeps the miners happy as they can get paid for maintaining the network. Bitcoin now should start functioning as a currency.  
Now would this idea work? Hell if I know...It sure as shit would be interesting though right? But it will never happen because as much as people claim they view bitcoin as a currency...they are using it as a commodity.

I don't want to hold all my net worth in cash because over time, my money won't keep up with inflation. If I invest that in a company, say Ford, or US Steel or Apple, or whatever the fuck, my stock will maintain a value (assuming the company does not implode) that will meet or exceed the rate of inflation. When I want to, I can then cash out. I am effectively loaning said company money for them to use. I then get some of their profit from that loan. 
Were USD or Bitcoin work in a deflationary manner, I would not invest it in any company. Those companies then could not raise capital. They would then go under eventually. A lack of capital investment has severely hurt US based manufacturing as investments have primarily gone overseas.  
What businesses are you talking about that create things people don't want? Is there like a "Buckets of Shit" restaurant down the road that people pay for but don't eat there?

Which are not necessary if you just use a credit card. 
Using an escrow service for every little thing makes as much sense as going to small claims court every single time their is an issue with a payment or service disagreement.

I'm not concerned with it. Miners have ever right to follow what they believe is the best course of action for themselves. For them however, the rate of return will lessen more and more until they can control the network and set their own terms...which they should. 
Unless people start exchanging a much larger percentage of coins in existence, miners will be force into larger and larger pools. You will never get people to run your network for free. So unless you have enough transactions to pay for that network, miners will come together to increase their profits. 
Either people need to spend their damn coins or they need to come to terms with the fact that one or two pools are going to control the entire network. Either way, I don't have a personal stake in the matter other than observation and sharing my thoughts.

No I agree. If I were a TSA agent and I knew that, then of course, it would make sense he would have them on him. However, if I was the agent, and I had no clue he was coming from a convention or that he sold these items, just that he is bringing a bag of metal onto an airplane, I would expect to ask what they are for and why he had them. 
I don't believe that is being unreasonable. 
From my own experience as an Automation Field Engineer, I used to carry my tools and parts with my carry on. The usual fluke, wires, crimpers, small screw drivers, metal bits, whatever... I now just keep that stuff in my regular luggage, only taking my work laptop and documents rather than dealing with the extra mess at the security checkpoints just because the bag would look like a potential bomb in the x-ray machine.

There are a couple of huge roadblocks in the way, from the actual terms of service, to the supposed value of the coins, which could lead to a very long and drawn out fight. Add in the international nature of the actual fraud, its a basket case. 
The actual worth of the coins in questions and establishing clear lines of ownership are the two most difficult aspects to determine. My understanding of the actual problems that hit MtGox are due to their absolutely garbage record keeping as oppose to intentional fraud on their count. That is NOT to say that MtGox should not face serious repercussions. As I read your linked content, we are dealing with a highly complex case in which a law firm would have to pay out a considerable amount of money for forensic accounting. 
It is my belief that the average MtGox user will not see a single dime.

Yeah I generally end up getting an extension as my tax situation for a given year can be highly fluid. For example, this year, I worked about 4 months in Australia. That means I have to pay Australian Federal and local taxes for that time period. I then spent the rest of the year working in the UAE. UAE has no "official" taxes on labor so I'm in the clear for that. However, since I did not reach 330 out of 365 days overseas (I was 12 days short due to an injury requiring treatment in the states) I have to pay US state and Federal taxes. Kind of sucks as I would have had a $98k to write off on the taxes :(
Its more of a mess as my company has to reimburse me for taxes overseas that I paid for so I have a net zero loss for Aussie land...but I still have to pay, document, and then get it out of corporate. I am still dealing with the previous year as I had to file while in India. 
So I end up using like three different companies to handle my tax prep depending on their specialty.

You still need to pay for the network. Every transaction requires verification. Miners are suppose to get reimbursed for doing so by receiving a small fee. Larger if you want priority priority verification. 
A miner does not use less energy maintaining a network depending on the amount of verifications. The costs are basically fix costs. There is nothing a miner can really do to lower their costs baring inventing new technology. And the arms race to get the smaller number of "free" coins for running the network means that entry costs into miner has skyrocketed. 
These costs are never going away and they don't disappear by making the network decentralized. The costs are what is driving miners to come together to try and share the burden. 
Once bitcoin no longer creates coins for mining, the only means of generating funds is off of transactions. If there are not enough transactions, then the mining pools will start setting their own prices. But to do that, you need to control the network so its not like there will be multiple pools fighting among each other, driving down transactions fees. 
The end game will always result in a super pool setting their own terms. Once the costs of transaction verification reaches a certain point, there will be no benefit to using bitcoin.
Now I am not saying this will be the end of crypto-currencies. Bitcoin will serve as a road map to avoid serious problems in the next format. I just cannot rationally see how bitcoin will be able to address these issues without massive, fundamental change which will drive many early users away.

@_date: 2014-03-01 23:06:32
Well lets examine this with a little bit of perspective. The total US economy was approximately $16.8 trillion in 2013. Most estimate that the US banking sector made up about 56% of that total, but for ease of the math, lets just call it at 50%. So the US banking sector (no one else in the world) was directly involved in $8.4 trillion in 2013. 
Now lets assume that MtGox got all the coins stolen and their value is what they say they are at  $473 million. Truth be told, I do not agree with that direct valuing of the asset because if those 850,000 bitcoins were to enter the market immediately, the value of them would drop like any commodity. But for the sake of this conversation, we will assume top dollar amount. 
So for a cartel running the US banking sector, you are claiming that they would involve themselves with a moron who did not understand basic banking practices, to shut down something that represents 0.00056309523% of just the US economy. 
Were I to do the math for the World's banking sector, the percentage would get even smaller. Why would they even bother? It makes no sense. Its much more logical that MtGox and their management were not prepared in any fashion to run an exchange, got way over their heads, and hoped for the best rather than actually admit there was a problem.

@_date: 2014-01-16 02:08:31
I would like to discuss each of these items separately...
Non-reversible transactions are NOT good for merchants. You have to depend on your suppliers. Especially in the restaurant field, where overhead costs can be very tight to revenue, it would be very easy to lose everything by running into a situation in which you could not recoup losses. 
Per the cost of using credit cards, credit cards include basic fraud protection. You don't get that with bitcoin transactions. You don't get any fraud protection. You are basically hoping you don't get screwed by someone. 
Per the 20,000 merchants signed up...lets bump that up to 30k. And we will assume that these merchants are ALL in New York City. So best case, unrealistic scenario for this restaurant owner. What percentage do you think that is of the total number of businesses inside of New York City for the year of 2007? 
1.5% of the total number (census data puts the number of businesses at 1,956,733). That is a TINY number of businesses. In reality, you need to spread that out across the US. Wanna guess what it is?
0.11%  This guy has to basically hope his suppliers happen to be part of a TINY number of businesses that use bitcoin.
These are serious problems that would greatly influence whether or not a business would try to use Bitcoin as a medium for exchange. I could not recommend this guy doing this. Also, tax liability would be a problem.

I would agree with you if the consensus was just that...EVERYONE GET THEIR COINS OUT OF MTGOX...in big bold letters. But that was not the case. There were many voices, implying they were to be respected, calling for people to not pull their coins and that MtGox was solvent. 
Obviously in hindsight, they were wrong. And I lost nothing as I never had anything in MtGox. But this notion that and the rest of the bitcoin community was united in warning there were problems at MtGox is simply not true. 
There were prominent people that moderate this very subreddit, that were encouraging people to keep their coins in MtGox. User beware and all that jazz is good. But to pretend there weren't people on the sidelines feeding this mess is not accurate in my opinion.

I mean, I am just passing on my thoughts. To each their own. I just can't imagine having an issue with $100k getting locked up in something going screwy with bitcoin. 
You got legal, security, and financial concerns that are unique to bitcoin investment. It only makes sense if the user was only using a tiny fraction of their income. If that is the case, they can afford much better investments in my opinion. It just doesn't make sense to me. 
Again, just my opinion.

Naturally there was a massive flop and twitch, and the TSA was created to basically set rules for folks to fly on US airplanes, pre-screen boarders, and regulate access to various areas at an airport.
Generally the job sucks, low pay and long hours, leading to low quality of employees. If you have ever flown internationally, you would see just how fucking terrible the US is at running an airport. 
Due to the amount of traveling I do, I ended up getting a global entry permit to cut out as much of the bullshit as possible but its still a pain in the ass. It doesn't help that generally Americans are fucking idiots at traveling, drawing out the security check point process as they try to bring utterly stupid shit on board all the time or argue with TSA agents who are just trying to do their shitty jobs.

You are demanding a restaurant chain to make extensive investments based on multiple unique things happening in succession.
1) there is a massive economic upheaval in with the monetary system that 300 unique consumers use,, crumbles.
2) Chili's,  as a restaurant chain, survives this event.
3) the 300 million users move to using bitcoin rather than any other potential replacement for the us dollar.
If any of the three do not happen, Chili's just pissed away a bunch of money for no reason.
You have already shown that one can use bitcoin to eat at this restaurant chain, at no incurred cost to said chain. You are demanding that a private business make an economically unsound and unneeded investment.  This makes zero sense from their perspective.

Well thankfully our court system, along with Japan's, does not work on "guesses", assumptions, or warm fuzzy feelings. 
MtGox getting ripped of by hackers, not realizing it, and continuing to operate is NOT the same as criminal fraud. The actual definition of fraud would be determined by the jurisdiction. Just because an American clients lost US dollars, does not mean a fraud case will go through the US courts. That is the reason why the US government does not invade Nigeria over phone/email scams. It would be a violation of their national sovereignty. 
So say the case goes through Japan (which I suspect is the most likely action), Japanese prosecutors will have to prove that MtGox effectively hacked themselves....which is insanely stupid...to prove intentional fraud (assuming that Japan has a similar legal definition to the US).  
Per your criminal negligence accusation, I don't think you actually realize what that legal term means...
Its "Gross Negligence" or just "Negligence"  which would potentially be the charge under the US Federal Government.

I always try to come from a good place with my ribbing if that makes any sense. There are issues with bitcoin that prevent me from investing in good consciousness. The consolidation of miners is a critical flaw within the bitcoin  system design that I think will eventually break it. But that is just my opinion. To each there own.

In regards to law, reddit is a terrible place to get advice. 
Its a terrible place for most advice, but when it comes to legal issues...just don't. Personally, using bitcoin as a renter...I think is a bad idea in many potential situations. I don't know which state you are talking about or the number of properties your landlord generates income from. Depending on the locality, you could already be at a disadvantage as a renter, for example Alabama. Removing more consumer protections may not serve you. 
There is also the issue of the landlord potentially losing his income from you, ie his in experience with bitcoin leaves him vulnerable.  If he only operates this property,  he may end up losing it (assuming worse case scenario with his book keeping). Now you got to move.
Really though, you need to talk with a lawyer for your state and locality, preferably in real estate.

It would be a an issue for taxes. The business owner would basically have to keep track of each exchange, what the difference was.

I would not view bitcoin as an  investment. Its way too volatile in price. We got a number of folks here who heavily invested cash into bitcoin with the expectation that the price will continue to increase. The problem is that we don't have a firm concept of what the price currently is. 
Bare with me...
A significant portion of bitcoins are held in massive wallets that have never moved. If even a portion of those coins enter the market, the price will bottom out. I could not, in good faith, tell you to just buy and hold. Now a lot of people here will tell you to do just that because they want more coins being held to raise the price. Effectively they want you to buy them out of the game in a sense. Bail them out for their decisions. 
If you are going to use it for commerce, than I would use it like a checking account. Keep just enough in to do what you want. That way if you want to get out and the bottom falls out of the market, you aren't hurt too badly. 
In my opinion, the days of the huge price climbs and the folks making large amount of cash just by purchasing and then holding coins before selling are gone. People who are doing that now are effectively trying to day trade...which statistically not a great way to make money long term. Its basically gambling.
Just my two cents and do what you want with it.

If a business does not make a return on the investment necessary to use bitcoin, then most businesses will not use it. 
Also, for your above comment (as I do not wish to have to comment twice to the same personal insults), of course USD can be stolen. And there is a system and regulations in place that helps prevent open theft. 
Again, I suspect I am talking to someone who has never actually run a business of any real size. Its physically not possible for me, and many business people, to meet every single one of my suppliers and demand to see their books.

The problem with Japan is that they are set up to be heavily dependent in imports and exports. A strong yen kills their ability to compete globally. The same is true for US and EU companies that do international work. A strong Euro hurts European firms and likewise for the dollar. 
You don't want people just holding onto a currency. You want a steady and predictable rate of inflation to encourage consumption and investment.  A truly deflationary currency, such as the US dollar post WWII but pre-Marshall Plan is problematic as it grinds the economy to a halt. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:27:16
It would heavily complicate my life. My tax situation is already very complex as I generally end up working in roughly three or four countries through the fiscal year. As it stands, I usually have to convert my per diem and overtime from Yen, to local currency, to USD. Depending on the locations, I also have to pay local taxes as well as US state and federal. I can write my fees involving converting funds into various currencies off my taxes or at least be reimbursed by my local contract employer. Bitcoin would highly complicate things and would not actually save me any money in my situation. 
I did a job in Mozambique for a very short period of time, during which there were local social disruptions. The project got cancelled after only a few weeks. Because of the potential Civil War, the local currency imploded and I ended up making less money in Mozambique than I would have had I just stayed in my apartment in the states. I could not change out my money fast enough. 
A similar situation could potentially happen with bitcoin. While that could happen with USD, there are 300 million users, which stabilizes disruptions. The user base for bitcoin is much smaller.

Again, if a currency functions in a deflationary manner, than what then encourages investment and economic development? Why would you ever invest in anything if you can just hold onto bitcoins with an ever increasing value?
This is a very legitimate question. 
Man stream adoption is critical. Without it, bitcoin will remain a fringe internet "thing".  
I would like clarification on what your actual desire for bitcoin to achieve. Do you want it to just increase in dollar value? Do you want it to replace the USD as currency? If it did, would you chose to invest it into companies or just hold onto it, using only a small amount to purchase items as you need them (like food and/or other lifestyle needs)?

I respect your views. In a theoretical view, as long as people continue to invest a deflationary currency, there should be no issue. From my experience, that is not usually the case however. 
I work for a Japanese company. Right now there are many market concerns in regards to the Super Typhoon hitting the Philippines. In situations like this, local markets have their money pulled and dumped into the Japanese market as its seen as a safe harbor. This in turn raises the value of the Yen. 
When that happens, it kills the company I work for as we cannot compete as well against European and US firms. 
My point is that inflation is not always bad nor is deflation always good. And people don't always have the same needs from a currency. Your desire for a currency that increases in value constantly would not be the same for everyone. I prefer a steady, predictable inflation rate as I feel it encourages investment in US and international manufacturing (I work in automation of Steel and shipping sectors).  
Economics is a very complex topic. Its not as simple as "A is always true; B is always false". Heck not even all the actors in a market will act rationally.

Here is the issue I keep running into...the revenue coming into the business, due to the acceptance of bitcoin, has to offset the cost and other hassles of using bitcoin. 
That won't happen anytime soon.
Reddit...losses money on bitcoin. The act of accepting bitcoins costs reddit more money than they generate from it. Reddit has a portion of its consumer base already well verse in the usage of bitcoin...and it has lost money because the claim that going to the trouble of accepting bitcoins will open up new streams of revenue is a bullshit fallacy...because reality is much more complex than that. 
Basically this business owner is expected to open himself to a huge  potential of fraud, complicate moving his funds around, risk significant tax liabilities, on the off chance that some people will use his business who didn't before.

How long do you think arbitration or a legal proceeding takes? In the time it requires to take a supplier to court, I could be out of business. 
I get it...you most likely think running a business is the same as selling shit individually on ebay from your parents' basement, but in the real world, you can be in a situation of taking in $10k a month, and need to immediately turn that over the majority of that to suppliers. Money is constantly going in and out...and unlike MtGox, successful businesses track their books closely. 
There is no separating your customers' money from your suppliers' money. If I have one supplier fuck me, I cannot use that as an excuse to not pay my other suppliers or my employees. I don't have fucking time or the resources to stop everything on a dime every time I have an issue with a single supplier.

Do you mean "interpret"? Sorry, my English is not the best so this is most likely confusion on my part. 
Its easy to look at a security situation from a background not based in security and view actions as being unreasonable. For example, many Americans do not seem to have an issue with profiling folks who they expect to be more likely terrorists. For example, Muslims from the Middle East. The problem with this is that it ignores historical data.
The Lod Airport Massacre occurred in Israel around '72 I believe. A bunch of Christian pilgrims were slaughtered by three members of the Japanese Red Army, acting in support of the PLO. Pretty much three well dressed Japanese folks with instrument cases were allowed to pass security check points because they did not fit the perceived terrorist characteristics used by Israeli security at the time. Turns out they had machine guns and grenades, and I believe over 30 people were killed. 
It becomes very difficult like you say, to anticipate every single condition involving a terrorist group, spree killer, bomber, whatever. And TSA agents clearly do not have any real authority to deviate from what they are suppose to follow.

We don't bring up the fact that a LOT of people were defending MtGox until the very end (folks very high in the bitcoin community). We ignore the fact there were victims trying to extract their money for TWO YEARS. Yet now...whenever MtGox comes up, we have assholes that basically say "Hurr hurr...there were signs and its your fault for not getting out". 
Karpeles is not the only person involved in the MtGox scheme.

I always believe in exposing oneself to views that I may not agree with. Especially in terms of investing, you don't want to get blinders put on. I think the big reason why MtGox was able to hurt so many people is that many folks just heard the good news and blocked everything else.

I would not state that the future looks promising for bitcoin at all. Right now you have the bitcoin community diverging into two separate groups who have very separate goals. That is the miners and the consumers. 
The miners are being forced into larger and larger pools due to the nature in which bitcoin is designed to work. The end goal was that enough transactions would occur that miners would no longer be required to be rewarded for maintaining the network. Hence why the coins become more and more difficult to mine. 
The problem is that the vast majority of coins do not move. They hare being held for speculative purposes. Since the coins are not being exchanged, the miners will never get reimbursed for maintaining the network as it was originally planned. 
So for the miners to recoup their costs and make a profit, they will further consolidate their collective power further, allowing them to fully control the network. Its not in their best interests to decentralize anything. They are being completely rational here. 
So one of two things will happen...either significantly more people start exchanging coins (unlikely) or the cost to use bitcoins goes up. When the cost to use bitcoin comes anywhere close to using CC or other banking needs, then there is really no reason any rational person should expose themselves to the difficulties in using bitcoin.

We are basically discussing three separate states. I will try to clarify them so we are on the same page. If I have erroneously surmised your position, I apologize and it was not intentional. 
a) the network is such that no pool is close to 51%. You argue this is ideal. I argue that this will never exist outside of an overarching  entity that has the authority to maintain it. For such an entity to exist, the  majority of users would revolt. 
b) Ghash goes over 51%. I argue that this is the natural state for the network as there are not even pressure to prevent this from ever happening unless everyone cashes out. Users have invested too many resources in my opinion for this to be seen as a viable means to address their concerns. For lack of a better explanation, the users will learn to live with it. I would also argue that this state is not necessarily "bad" in the idea that suddenly bitcoin is seen as a less viable means of commerce (I would argue there are FAR more problematic problems to the acceptance of bitcoin use in the global economy than just a large governing pool of miners).  
c) Ghash goes over 51% and begins to use that position for its benefit. This to me is a very grey area. I don't believe that Ghash or anyone else in this position would so grossly do it up front because as you state, people will then attempt to cash out, collapsing the whole system. My point is if Ghash did face a situation like this, they could very easily prevent people from cashing out by intentionally forking the chain. This has happened in another crypto-currency...which name escapes me at the moment, to prevent a hacker from making off with a significant number of their coins. 
Have I paraphrased our positions correctly?

Lets pretend that Bitcoin is a stable currency...like the UAE Durham (which I am using just because I spent the last 9 months working in the UAE). In our conversation, we will artificially tie the rate of exchange directly to the dollar at a straight 20 to 1 ratio...20USD gets you 1btc. There is no massive speculation, the market is healthy, whatever.
Buuuuuut...it is still not widely used in the US. So basically for this situation, our business owner can accept btc, but they cannot pay their distributors or their staff. I think this is reasonable for this discussion.
The problem becomes that the 20 to 1 ratio is not a straight 20 to 1. Like the AED (which is 3.67 to 1 USD), you don't get 367AED for 100USD. You get something like 363, ignoring the associated fee using an official exchange. So even assuming that bitcoin is sable (which we all need to agree is not the current situation) the business owner is effectively incurring a cost for each and every exchange. That will then have to get passed onto his customers, which would make his business less competitive. With bitcoin, its even more problematic as there trying to move large amounts of bitcoins into USD causes problems. Its WAY too easy to have an account frozen, which can be crippling for a business. 
Look, this is just my opinion. Working overseas extensively, having to deal with exchange rates is a pain in the ass. I could not imagine choosing to deal with exchange rates unless I didn't specifically have to do it in my job.

The coins aren't lost...at least according to my logic. If I am flawed, anyone feel free to correct me. 
Pretty much what killed MtGox was thus...
I go to a bank with a check and ask the bank teller to cash it...say $100USD. She gives me the cash, but looks over and I pocket the cash. I then tell her that she never gave me the cash. So instead of checking, she just gives me another $100. 
Naturally this teller should be fired. Furthermore, the bank should regularly go back and check their books and make sure that their books actually reflect what they currently have. 
What MtGox did was never bother to check, even know this bad teller (the flaw) was present. So for about 2 years, this screw up was occurring over and over again.
So in my example, have I lost the extra $100 I pocketed? No. What I have done is robbed MtGox and destroyed their books. 
The coins still exist...MtGox just doesn't know who has them. They thought they had them...and the have accepted cash for those coins, but they don't have the means to either give people back their cash or have the means to get the coins back. 
Ultimately in my mind, this entire fiasco is BAD BOOK keeping. MtGox never practiced proper security but even more importantly any recognized and standard accounting practices. 
Since they never kept track of their books, they basically allowed a problem that should have been able to recognize and stop early on, to expand to the point that MtGox is worthless. People are asking them to show their documents and whatnot but at this point, its worthless. 
So in my mind, the coins still exist. None have been created or destroyed erroniously. MtGox just handed them out and never kept track correctly. 
This are just my thoughts however and if I have made any technical mistakes or have any facts wrong, which I welcome anyone correcting me.

Were this position true, that the single dominating factor for a group of people to be nationalistic, is a strong central bank, based on a single currency, then there would be many countries that would have collapsed over the years. 
Zimbabwe, Germany (post WWI), Somalia, Turkey, pretty much much of the world during the Great Depression...
I would argue that religion, racial, ethnic, tribal, and religious ties for a specific population is much more important factors towards the acceptance of nationalism than simply a central currency.  
A number of countries that I have worked in had economic conditions in which I did not convert USD to local currency as the USD was preferred.

As a person that works for a Japanese company, I don't understand why people want these currency fluctuations. 
Every time there is a major crisis in Asia, be it environmental/political/social, money gets pulled out of local markets and dumped into the safe Japanese markets. This causes the yen to peak rapidly, which kills the Japanese economy. We can't compete with US and Euro firms.

I'll share my concerns if you want...
I think a major problem with the bitcoin community, and this is not unique to at all, is that there is an erroneous concept that all users have the same goals, rational, and uses for the format. 
That isn't the case at all. The scammer has a different set goals than the honest consumer. The miner has a different set of goasl than the bitcoin user. The customer has a different set of goals than the merchant. The person speculating has a different set of goals than the consumer who views bitcoin as a currency.
I think the biggest problem bitcoin is facing right now is that the majority of the coins are held and not used. You cannot expect minors to maintain the network for free. They have to at the very least earn back their cost for providing the necessary service of maintaining the public ledger. The problem is that bitcoin was set up with the intention that the miners would be reimbursed through the normal transactions of the overall system. But there isn't enough traffic and there never is going to be enough as long as the majority of coins do not move. 
This is not unique to bitcoin. If you had a major credit card company set up where a network was monitoring the credit cards of 200k unique users...and if the majority of the cards were never used, the system could not sustain itself in terms of costs. Its the whole reason why you don't see a massive store in the middle of nowhere. You need to have consumers to offset the costs
Eventually miners will no longer receive any reward from mining and be solely dependent on bitcoins being exchanged. Already, the lowering return on mining and the costs involved in maintaining rigs have already encouraged a heavy centralization of processing power. It will only get worse until eventually the miners will be forced to take over the network and set their own terms for handling traffic. At this point, the cost of using bitcoin for consumers will climb. 
To consumers, the miners are acting irrational. To miners, the consumers are irrationally expecting a free lunch. The only answer is for the people holding the majority of coins to start circulating them. But you aren't going to get people to start doing that as long as they think its in their best interests to hold onto the coins for speculative purposes. 
Just my thoughts...
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:18:28
Well what ends up happening is that a portion of the delay penalty goes onto our suppliers. Depending on the size of the project, there are entire other companies that handle all funds in escrow over payments. I was involved in a nightmarish project in the Middle East and about $20 million was tied up in I shit you not, over the translation of the government contract (all contracts in there are in Arabic and English). 
The whole point is that we never handle cash. The amounts are simply too large (for the example I mentioned prior, three drives installed were something like $350k a piece). To me, bitcoin adds in the difficulty of dealing with fluctuating currency values, which is something I deal with (I work for a Japanese company). We get paid in Euro/USD/Whatever and half to move it to Yen. Our problem usually happens when markets in Asia are doing bad, so people dump cash into the Japanese Stock Exchange. That rising the value of the yen, killing our company. 
Its much easier to eliminate that issue if you don't have to deal with it as it ties in factors out of your control into your bottom line. One month could look profitable until the last minute and then you are screwed (has happened to me).

Gold as a currency did not prevent the Great Depression. Some economists, though this is not a universal opinion, have argued that gold standard exasperated the problems of the Great Depression by limiting currency supply. 
You see the same issues we are having with bitcoin. Price widely fluctuates, with a small group of people able to heavily influence the price. Basically economic activity is tied into the available gold supply. Its not predictable.

Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible. For a business like a restaurant or bar, where there is a LOT of overhead, and the actual profit margin is quite thin, bitcoin is not great idea.

In most commerce, trust does not naturally exist.
For example, I just did a retrofit for a subsystem of a steel mill. The mill had to be shutdown during the work. Everyday that the mill was down, the mill was incurring a cost of something like $17k. 
My company sold a trio of new drives that the customer had to build a building for. They laid the power cables and wiring, while I was tasked with the initial inspections, power ups, and commissioning of the drives. In the course of the project, we discovered that our supplier in German shipped us a batch of bad contacts. That was a delay of two days to get fixed, resulting in a $34k penalty for me. Had I used bitcoin, I would be fucked. 
I would spend more time in court dealing with shit like this than actual work. Traditional banking means are just better in every way shape and form compared to the wild wild west that is currently bitcoin.

This is my perspective based on the points that brought up. 
1) It does not cost nothing to implement bitcoin for a business. I really wish people would stop claiming that. Any changes to book keeping costs money. Your family is going to have to take the time and train themselves on computer security, tax laws, and bitcoin. This is not something that people should just jump into. Each situation is unique. People that jump all in are generally the ones that have the most problem. This takes time and time equals money. 
2) You need to have at least a local market to support this transition. If there is one, then moving to bitcoin makes sense. People need to remember that all markets are local when you look at them close enough. 
3) Businesses must examine whether or not the lack of charge backs is worth potential customer service issues. No business wants to deal with pissed off customers. Even if you get their money that time, bad PR can result in lower sales. Butterfly Labs like the lack of charge back...that doesn't mean that the dysfunctional manner in which they provide services would or should work for every other business. 
4) If they do enough international business, then this makes sense. If they don't do any or have little, then its not worth the transition. I could take foreign currencies through my job...but it would not make sense for me as it would not be worth the time and effort. 
5) Its easier for very large companies to make the transition to bitcoin because their consumer base is large enough to outweigh the positives over the negatives. If in this situation, your customer base is small and local, it may not make sense to make the transition. The smaller companies that have made this transition and have had success generally are either internet base or they have a significant local population already using bitcoin. 
The best way to get people to your position is to examine their own. They are going to make decisions that seem rational to themselves. If you can put yourself into their perspective, you will be able to see how to address their concerns and prepare for them before they even get raised. 
Just my thoughts...

I must disagree with you that the demand for  a deflationary currency would grow at the same rate as the value for the currency. 
Historically that has not happened. Generally it slows activity until the point that the currency becomes useless as no one is willing to spend it. 
You are assuming that people will act rational. What you or  I can sit here and think is rational is not going to be so for  all people. Most people, with a deflationary currency, will hold onto that currency no matter what it does to economic activity as a whole. 
I'm not saying that is logical or rational.

You're kidding right? I keep seeing this again and again...how is not having the ability to have to contest charges a straight benefit for merchants? What are they suppose to do if one of their suppliers screw them?
Also, what is a merchant suppose to do when their account gets shutdown for suspicious activity for trying to convert a laughably low amount?
I mean I like bitcoin. But in the current form of the bitcoin economy, a business doing any considerable amount of volume would have to be insane to try and give it a go. If reddit can't make money off of bitcoin, how is a mom and pop store suppose to?

Not that there is really a way to prove this, but I work as a field engineer internationally in industrial automation. 
Last year, before taxes, I pulled that in about a week and a half. Converting over to Bitcoin completely would result in a significant loss of earning potential, especially for a one fell swoop, into a highly volatile, digital commodity. It just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion to do this.
Its basically the same reason why I would not quit my job and just go into day trading full time.

But with credit cards, you do get benefits not available through bitcoin commerce. 
Their customer base is also not educated in the use of bitcoin. 300 million people in the US understand how to use credit cards and cash. 
Its a catch 22 of course. You need users to increase the need for bitcoin. But you have to have a need for bitcoin to increase users.

It just makes no sense to me that folks expect the pools to remain small. The investment now required to go into mining forces them to pool resources. We tend to view the entire bitcoin community as having the same goals...which is illogical. The miners are different than the hoarders, who are different from the spenders, who are different than the merchants, etc. Yet the theme on is for people to just absurdly act all the same. What is rational to one user group is completely irrational to others. I fully admit, I don't own any crypto-currencies, but I have been following it from the very beginning, not only for the technology, but the utterly fascinating social dynamic experiment it has created. I'm amazed that sociologists are not doing studies just on the overall bitcoin community.  
This sort of leads to the crazy grey area so give me a moment....
Alright! End game! GHASH starts realizing that they can't make money just off of transactions because not enough people are using bitcoins as currency, but holding them for commodity purposes! HOLY SHIT THIS IS GOOD COKE! 
So they end up having to either a) force people to move coins around or b) jacking up transfer fees. Both are a problem for the community. So they just go after the whale wallets. The first users with shitload of coins that never move them. Basically tell them, use them, move them, or we blackball you from the ledger. THAT would be interesting. DAMN THIS IS GOOD COKE!!!

If my customers lack a means to easily address issues, be they quality, delivery, or potential fraud, I am just as lacking if I develop an issue with a supplier or a delivery service. 
I work on large automation projects. I simply cannot develop a one on one relationship with every one of my suppliers. The last job I was on had pumps from Brazil and India, drives built in the US using Japanese supplied parts, with a PLC system built in Germany. 
This was for a steel mill, where every single day delayed results in a $56k fine (basically that is the loss in production for the steel mill that goes directly against my company). Now in a $15 million project...that's not much...but it adds up quick. 
I can't just sue every time we have an issue with a supplier. Now its a bit more complex in my situation. Our suppliers sign contracts but the documentation required uses traditional banking means...otherwise, my company eats the total cost of the delays. 
In this project, the one supplier sent the wrong communication cards for the drives. 4 day delay...boom...$224k sucked out of the project. You damn sure that my supplier paid a steep penalty.

I am honestly shocked how we are not seeing the same issue. When my company places bid on a project, we are already incurring costs. Usually its around $40-50k before we finish the negotiations. Once that is complete, we begin processing, which depending on the size of the project, leaves us about $500k to over a million in the red. 
Once we start hitting production goals, parts of the payment plan begin to happen, where we basically start pulling ourselves out of the hole. If we meet the final contract stipulations, we then make a profit. But the entire time, we are incurring costs through parts and labor. Anytime I have an issue with my customer involving payment, say their money doesn't clear, it affects my overhead. It affects my employees, and it sure as shit affects my suppliers and the relationship I have with them.
This entire subreddit is filled with people talking about mtgox taking weeks to process their transactions. This is not an issue when you are a customer and just have to wait a while to make another purchase online. When you have a dynamic business, with a LOT of people depending on you being able to rapidly, reliably, and safely transfer your liquid funds, the volatility of bitcoin becomes a nightmare. 
You cannot separate your "customers" monies from that of your "suppliers". Its the SAME DAMN MONEY.

You want a new economic system developed by a tiny number of volunteers. 
Its my opinion that one of the largest road blocks to the success of bitcoin is the community itself. You people cannot get something out of nothing. You want a world wide network...but you expect it to maintain itself. 
But then again...anyone actually taking control and trying to iron out the bugs would lead to screaming out centralization. 
Also read up on your US history. The founding fathers made out like bandits, especially George Washington who used the war as an excuse to kick volunteer soldiers off their land (starting the great American institution of fucking over veterans as soon as a war is over). 
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:36:27
No...its much more complicated than you realize. Corporations pay credit card companies for the right to provide those rewards. The credit card companies don't pay for those rewards. 
So even assuming that you were a credit card company (which is a whole other big mess), you would need someone to pay for the coins. If you are going to get that from fees generated by the cards, you are going to have a card that no one in their right mind would ever use. It would not be able to compete with regular cards.

So we self regulate it then? How exactly is that possible? (I apologize if my tone comes off as rude or inciting as neither are my goal). 
My view is that no matter what, governments are going to do what they want to do. Without increasing users, bitcoin cannot expand. Artificially placing restrictions on its use (which again, I fail to see how that is even possible) will do nothing to prevent the state from usurping bitcoin or outlawing it. 
Its either wide open for use...or its basically fiat currency...only a much bigger pain in the butt to use.

I understand the technology. The concepts are not difficult. People neet to stop acting like cryptocurrency is on par with the Polio vaccine. I think it can be a valuable tool, especially in terms of serving under utilized banking sectors. 
But I also believe that the largest proponents for bitcoin do not understand basic human behavior or even the concept of running a business outside of their own tiny perspective. I have been told repeatedly by folks that non-reversible transactions are a positive for merchants. ANYONE that makes that claim is talking out their butt. 
Before Bitcoin gets close to the threshold that folks here are clamoring for, there will have to regulations put into place...which would cause the crazies to get their pitchforks. 
In my opinion, I believe that dodgecoin as a better chance at this point, moving forward that bitcoin. Lord knows they are better at advertising.

Its the policy from corporate to never state directly if or when we are being paid to discredit bitcoin or another product online. Now from what I understand, the government guys have a pretty sweet deal where their benefits are not tied into performance. So their shit is not affected by the rate of acceptance or btc price so its good to be government employed when bitcoin is going well. The negative to that is we in the public sector are killing it since the CIA boys took down MtGox.

Its difficult to predict the behavior of bitcoin in my mind because so damn many coins are locked up and never move. My own personal opinion, this is the largest single problem with bitcoin, compared to a 51% attack. We have no real idea of the "true" value of all the coins. 
My honest opinion, eventually some group will get a static share of plus 51% of the network. Initially you will see a good bit of volatility, but eventually that will become the new norm. A 51% attack will always be on the horizon...but so to will be the problem if one of the large whale wallets flood the economy with their coins. 
I often wonder how the ecosystem would react to just 10% of the long held coins entering the market suddenly. I am confused as to how folks are worried about a 51% attack (as they should), but are kosher with some of these massive wallets just sitting there like landmines. Sooner or later, eventually they will move.

One of the issues i have with bitcoin is that we do not really have a firm idea of what its real value is as so many coins are effectively locked up and never move. I think its a legitimate concern how the market will respond if some of the large, dormant wallets start moving coins.
I take issue with people looking at bitcoin as directly as an investment.  That makes it a commodity and not a currency. Commodities are not good means as a currency tool. You do not want a deflationary currency as this kills investment. Why would i invest in say a steel company when i could just hold onto my currency? This is what happened to the US dollar during the years after WWII. The value of the dollar was actually climbing faster than gold or oil because of the devastation of the war. The US was effectively owning everything and Europe could not purchase our goods. Since the US had the only untouched manufacturing sectors from the war, we were risking another global depression. This is why the Marshall Plan was launched in which the US just gave massive amounts of cash to Western Europe to then use to buy US goods. 
It is still very much in the air on whether or not bitcoin will succeed. I personally believe that bitcoin will be replaced by a different crypto-currency because bitcoin itself is not user friendly for mass adoption. Its not the people on you got to "sell" it to...its your grandma...the small town without internet access...the mom and pop hardware store. 
I agree with you though....its been one hell of a ride.

Tying a currency directly to one redeemable item causes problems. The supply of gold can  easily be manipulated. A good example of a commodity that is heavily manipulated is the price of diamonds. One could make the argument the same is true with bitcoin as the vast majority of coins in existence have never moved. It takes a relatively small amount of bitcoins, placed suddenly onto an exchange, to cause a drastic change in the price of bitcoin. We still don't know how much the price of bitcoin was heavily influenced by bot manipulation on MtGox during the massive bubble. 
Your list for the reasons that bitcoin have value should each be examined further. 
You state that bitcoin is accepted. Its very limited to where it is accepted, which in itself, heavily affects what one can actually get for bitcoins when selling them. Its similar to purchasing farm land in Australia. Australian farm land historically has been tied to the price of land in England, which is far more valuable. Similarly, people will often expect to get in USD, the value of their coins as being traded on the larger exchanges. However, in reality, people are more often forced to use localbits, which means they have to take a significant hit in the "value" of their coins. If I am somewhere I am not familiar with (I travel extensively for work), I would much rather have my credit card than my bitcoin wallet. Its just easier to get things done as the percentage of merchants accepting bitcoin is far too small and the process in which to use merchants that do is overly complex at this time. 
The argument that bitcoin can be transmitted nearly instantly has a number of caveats. Credit cards are effectively instant. Now credit cards are limited by infrastructure support. I have been in rural India where the network would be down frequently. But bitcoin would not be able to solve that either. The rate at which the bitcoin network can handle traffic is highly fluid. 
"Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit"...I have to disagree with this completely. We have already seen this happen in the bitcoin market, where malicious users were able to manipulate the protocol to double spend coins. That is effectively counterfeiting. This is why more people should be concerned about how much the percentage of miners have centralized already.  
I would say that at this point, using your definitions, that bitcoin is NOT back. I can't just go down the street to the gas station and fill my car up using bitcoin. At best, I can utilize multiple third parties to attempt to get a gift card, at which my value  in bitcoins is taking hits each step of the way. I'm also held to the concern that these transactions are not reversible. So at each step, I am running into the concerns of being a victim of fraud. 
That lack of ease of use and availability of use, limits bitcoins overall value. Remember...its easy to get people on to use it.  Its even easier if we just limit its use online. But for bitcoin to be truly accepted and displace traditional banking means, you need to get mom &amp; pop shops to accept it. Its got to be as easy to use for say...my mom as it is for her to use a credit card. 
If bitcoin had even a significant population of unique users that currently use USD, say 25%, you would see bitcoin prices through the fucking roof. It would make the MtGox bubble look cute by comparison. You would also see a much more stable price. 
But the problem is that you have a sort of a "chicken and the egg" situation. You can't get users without many...MANY more merchants using it. You can't get merchants to go along without a LOT more users.

To properly "counterfeit" the gold, its starts with a standard gold bar, with the serial numbers intact. In effect, you have a documented paper trail establishing its worth.
The gold bar is carefully hollowed out. It is then carefully filled with tungsten to match its original weight. You can basically take a gold bar, rip off about 80% of its value and unless the person purchasing destroys the bar through testing or has a sonogram machine (not all that common among smaller gold dealers. And again, since the original serial numbers are still exist, its easier to sell the "fake" bar. 
Its not the same as taking a rock and painting it gold color. A little bit more sophisticated.

USD has close to 330 million unique domestic users, along with many more international users. That is what backs it. Collectively we agree that a dollar in Maine is just as usuable in California.

The sophistication of gold fraud is actually pretty high. Unless you take a drill to your gold bar you just purchased (which most people would not think to do), its almost impossible to detect a good fake gold bar from real one without very expensive, non-destructive testing. 
And the level of "proper security" necessary to use bitcoin is incredibly high compared to other traditional banking means, which results in fewer people viewing bitcoin as a viable alternative. 
You are getting pretty aggressive here. If you do not wish this conversation to continue, I will happily move on.

I'm not so sure exactly what the baby boomer could have done differently. I mean most of the posr WWII economic prosperity in the US was directly due to the fact that much of the rest of the world was devastated by the war. Most preWWII industrial sites were either destroyed or heavily damaged. Most economic rivals were struggling for years just to feed their people, let alone export products. The US prosperity then was a bubble that could never last long term.
The simple fact that it was not until the 80's that globalisation was effecting US manufacturing shows how wide spread the destruction was. Now, most of the Europe, Asia, etc have rebuilt only with upgraded and modern infrastructure. Rust belt sites in the US can't really compete at all.
What we need is another global war that takes everyone out but the US again...only that is mever going to happen.

Banks didn't come up with credit cards. They were originally created by dining clubs. Banks saw the benefit so they got into the credit card business.
Same concept. They can look at bitcoin and/or the block chain and basically pick and chose what they like about it. Integrate that into what they offer their customer base. Unlike bitcoin, they would be able to make changes to their software rapidly, with a clear system of authority. The big problem with bitcoin is that there is a constant controversy at every step of the way. So instituting even the most minor changes results in difficulty.
I don't quite understand the view that seems to be widely accepted here that financial institutions just ignore technology. Its akin to arguing that Microsoft and Apple have never been influenced by the Linux Foundation...which is not the case at all. Financial institutions, and pretty much every company operates the same way if they want to remain successful. You see what others are doing and implement and tweak.

What specifically is wrong by what the IRS does? I mean that is like going to the DMV and complaining that the person behind the desk is wrong for charging you for getting a license. 
None of these people actually make the laws. They are just charged with enforcing them. The current problem for bitcoin is that it doesn't clearly match current definitions...but again, the IRS is tasked with trying to enforce the current tax code. So while it doesn't clearly fit...it does fit somewhat. Getting mad at them doesn't make sense. 
If you want to change this, you need to be politically active. vote at the state level. Participate and fund advocacy groups that match your view in terms of reform.

No worries. Your view is understandable and its not that out there honestly. Most people don't realize how big the ocean is. 
Piracy is a bit of a mess because the areas at which they occur have different reasons for them happening. This may surprise you, and I realize this makes me a very small minority of people, i actually feel bad for the pirates. 
In Indonesia waters, its very remote people that have been exploited by the majority for years and the whole reason they have access to firearms is because of a low level Civil War on some of the islands since WWII. 
In Somalia, the pirates are former fishermen. Once the Somalian government effectively fell, the territorial waters were no longer secured. The Chinese have pretty much destroyed the fishers all along the coast line. Pretty much everything is gone. On top of that, Italian organized crime families have been running dumping scams. They used to just do it in the Mediterranean Sea, but governments started noticing the dumping. 
You remember the tsunami that his Somalia? People were dying of radiation poisoning because of all the European radioactive waste that has been dumped in Somalian waters that came ashore. 
So pretty much there is no fishing. And its become a very establish industry. The pirates themselves don't actually make that much money. 
Until these issues are corrected in some way, piracy will exist.  
For the most part, ships try to minimize their time in dangerous areas. That Captain Phillips movie...yeah the opposite of what that shithead did (though the movie never touched on the fact that the idiot ignore his crews concerns and the instruction of the shipping company to stay further out to sea)
On larger cargo ships, when in dangerous waters, all crew not "on watch" basically take positions with fire hoses. On a large ship, its pretty hard to scale up the side of it, especially when you got firemain hitting you at like 150 psi. The ship also travels at the highest speed within reason. 
Like I said, the US navy travels through the Gulf of Aden, and when they do, they go slow. If any boats ask for help, they do it. At night, they change up their lights so the boats look smaller. Its not unheard of for the forward most destroyers to trick the pirates at night.  
As per the response time, it totally depends on where the ships are in relation to each other. I don't know how fast a carrier get get a helicopter in the air and/or how fast the thing flies. I know a carrier can do just around 34 knots (39 mph) at flank speed, which is faster than the smaller ships. 
Kind of amazing considering those fuckers weigh like 102,000 tons.

This is a common misconception a lot of people have about oil and the resources that Venezuela has. The oil reserves that Venezuela has is of low quality. What I mean is that its heavy crude oil which requires mixing with light crud oil to make it usable. It basically needs to be "cut". This is why Venezuela, despite having some of the largest reserves in the world, has to import oil from other nations, including the US. 
This is why heavy crude is heavily discounted on the market compared to light crude. It requires a lot more refining to create a profitable product.

The military, which I assume you are speaking of the US military, and specifically the US Navy, does not maintain military control over the entire planet. 
The US navy maintains facilities overseas to support its fleets, but its not like they are 24/7 in the open ocean. Furthermore is only a concern on major shipping routes, where there are geographic bottlenecks and typically localities that have poor local government control, like parts of South East Asia (Philippines and Indonesia) and Gulf of Aden (Somalia and Yemen). Other than those locations, ships are no where close to unsecured land areas. 
You don't worry about pirates when pulling into the Netherlands. What you would run into pulling into the Netherlands, a LOT of legal problems if your ship had weapons on them. Similar with the US, China, Russia, all the EU...pretty much everywhere. 
Also, the margins for shipping companies are not that great. When the global economy slowed down, something like 5,000 mariners were stuck in ports because their shipping company went out of business and the folks were not allowed to leave the ship. 
You ever wonder why Panama and Liberia have the most flagged ships? Its not due to their safety record. Its because if you are flagged Panamanian, the ship gets a better rate crossing the canal. If you go Liberian, you have zero inspections to worry about. 
No way in hell are shipping companies going to pay to have teams of people to just sit around with guns on a ship. Hell, when a cargo ship pulls into port now, the crew is not allowed to leave, because its potentially a delay getting the ship back out of the port. 
This is one of the reasons why most of the crews are 3rd world folks.  
Per your idea that a private company could provide rapid response, I don't think you understand how difficult it is to maintain a blue water fleet of ships. They would have to be blue water because they would not be able to set up shop in the regions. It would come very close to the legal territory of mercenaries (which despite the US's usage of Blackwater) is illegal internationally. It would also be insanely expensive. Heck, it would be cost prohibited just to try and maintain a radio service as a private company. We are talking about vast distances.
The US navy doesn't really provide this service. The best it does is basically move around the Gulf of Aden slowly when moving ships in and out of the 5th fleet. To get an idea of how difficult it is, the US navy is the only global navy that can regularly do blue water operations. The Russian and Chinese navies are effectively green water navies, rarely leaving their territorial waters. Like when the Russian moved their fleet to support Syria, a significant number of the boats had to turn around due to mechanical issues. 
This isn't something that a private company could effectively do. I would argue that the USN doesn't effectively combat piracy just because it requires so much work beyond what their capabilities are. 
And putting guns onto the ships aren't going to solve this. Its going to just make everything more expensive and potentially more dangerous. Believe me...the last people you want armed are a crew of pissed of mariners.

I'm assuming he is talking about doing undergrad or graduate level research for a University. Even if that is not the case, people are going to be in and out of a lab setting. 
A research setting is a fairly exploitative environment. There are more potential researchers than available slots. Its not unusual for people to fuck with rival's research. There is no way someone could be certain that their activities could not be discovered. 
I had a full ride for grad school to do research in mechanical engineer, specifically micro-materials. I got burned out doing undergrad research because it felt like I was in an insane daycare filled with some of the most petty, jealous, paranoid people on the planet. We were desperate to hold our positions because otherwise, we would get dropped from the program. Its even fairly normal for people to have their PhD's delayed because the folks running the lab did not want to lose people that did good research. 
Its not an environment that you want to give people ammo to use against you. 
My overall point is people shouldn't risk their job and/or career trying to do shady shit on the side. If its a university research lab, leaving for any reason is a HUGE black mark on your record. In a lot of ways, its like how  the NCAA exploits athletes.

Yes...you sold and made a profit. 
There are plenty of people though that are holding until the price hits a certain point. I am more than willing to bet that price range is right around where MTGOX topped out. Once that magic price point hits, I suspect there will be a significant sell off for people trying to make back the money they lost. 
That is my other issue with bitcoin's price. Much like the diamond market, a select group of people control far to much of the supply for the average person to have any real idea of what the true price is. 
If any of the Satoshi coins ever move, I suspect the sell off would be massive as people panic. The bitcoin market acts irrationally, like a penny stock, as opposed to a healthy, somewhat stable currency. At this point, the community isn't even pretending anymore that the goal is to create a new currency...its just people trying to get rich quick.

I just get annoyed by the people that claim they have made $xxxx in profit...when they have never sold a damn thing. Until they sell, they have made zero profit. 
The fact that the majority of users use bitcoin as a commodity instead of a currency means that its price will remain a constant up and down cycle, with everyone trying to time the bubbles, which in turn serves to cause the drops to be more severe. 
At least that is my opinion.

He ordered multiple hits on people. Just because he used bitcoin, people here act like he was the second coming of Jesus and was railroaded.

That isn't how solar plants work. You basically have two types. The one I type I think you are referring to utilizes solar cells which generate DC power. The positive, common, and negative bus are fed directly into drives which invert it to AC. Its then fed into transformers and into a grid. There is no "storing" of power because the systems are not efficient enough to make this a good investment of resources. 
There has been development in China to attempt to over produce energy in the day time and use excess at night, but its far from being practical. 
The other type utilizes mirrors to direct the energy of the sun to a point to heat up a liquid. In my experience, this liquid is usually sodium. Functionally its not different than a typical coal, nuclear, or gas power plant. I have more experience with these facilities, doing the drives for the salt pumps. 
I've done a lot of assignments in China (mostly steel mills and port facilities). These folks are not moving close to rural power plants to save energy costs in the way you think they are. They are doing this because its easier to bribe local officials in rural communities than it is in more urban areas of China. 
They aren't paying what they should be paying for their energy costs. They also get away with setting up these facilities with little in the way of safety. Every single picture I have seen of a mining facility in China shows gross electrical safety violations. 
As these mining facilities get larger, utilities are going to start pushing back very quickly because of the harmonics they are putting on the grid. This is a problem for anyone running a large server.

Well its the same issue with all commodities...and kind of why a deflating commodity for a currency is not necessarily a good thing. You don't want a situation where sitting on a currency just increases in value because that in turn will stop investment. It makes raising capital very difficult. A prime example of this happening with the US dollar is during the power WWII period. The US dollar was increasing at such a rate because the US was relatively unscathed in WWII compared to the rest of the world. 
Europe could not afford US products and when US cash was given to them, they could just hold onto it as it increased in value. It was going up higher than gold at the time. Eventually the entire global economy was going to shutdown as no one wanted to spend US dollars. 
Per the actual value of the coins...that is kind of in the air. Someone could not exchange that many coins without imploding the price. Again, this is a common issue with owning commodities.

The Moon (Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite.[e][9] It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites, the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits (itsprimary).[f][g] It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io).
The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago,not long after Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.
The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky (after theSun), as measured by illuminance on Earth's surface. Although it can appear a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectancejust slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and mythology.
The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant.

I want to be clear, I have no game in the fight over MtGox. My only perspective is as a foreign worker for a Japanese company. 
There are a lot of misconceptions about the legal system in Japan. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of my time working in the Middle East. For example, the police can pretty much hold a suspect indefinitely for questioning. There are suppose to be limits on the length of time, but its kind of a joke. I forget the total length of time they are allowed to hold a suspect, but they can pretty much just take them out to the parking lot, announce to the suspect they are free to go, and then immediately take them back in for questioning. 
The entire time, a person is held in solitary. Most of the day, you are required to sit in the lotus position, for hours at a time, not moving or speaking. 
Not surprisingly, Japan has a HUGE problem with people false confessing once they mentally breakdown from the questioning that can go on for weeks. Everything is restricted to break the subject down, even going so far as to limit caloric intake. 
Whether or not a suspect is guilty does not matter...the suspect is expect to confess. 
The government places a lot of effort into not bringing to light the problems with the Japanese legal system. And the MtGox fiasco caused the Japanese government to lose a LOT of face. I think Karpeles is charge with embezzlement, but I don't see how the government is going to make the charges stick without actual evidence beyond a confession. 
But again, the whole legal system in Japan is designed to wear suspects down. It doesn't matter that the bitcoin markets were completely unregulated...they are going to drag this out as long as possible. 
Now of course...I don't know what the state's evidence is...but the simple fact they eventually released Karpeles on probation tells me that their actual case is very weak...because there is no way in hell Karpeles has the sort of connections that say Yakuza members have.

I don't know...when you think about it...it wouldn't be *that* hard to ban bitcoin for most people to use. Create pain in the ass reporting requirements for businesses to accept bitcoin and most businesses won't bother with accepting it. 
I think a good comparison that isn't related to bitcoin or finance, but kind of explains my thinking is the situation with lethal injection in the US. 
I am NOT comparing using bitcoin to killing someone...just bare with me...
Most states in the US that use lethal injection are struggling because companies that can manufacture the chemicals don't want to risk their market share for chemical manufacturing in the EU. Its simply not worth the risk to generate a relatively short amount of profit just to satisfy a relatively small order. So companies, despite it not being illegal, and the EU not having direct control of markets in the US, are never going to risk it all just so Texas can snuff out about 60 people a year. 
Similarly, I work for an international engineering company. We provide products that require us to meet very stringent export/import controls. We could make a killing doing business in Iran...own the whole fucking market for them easily. But we would get blacklisted by the US and much of the EU. A 20% market share in those regions is a hell of a lot better than a 100% market share of Iran. 
I just don't think it would be all that difficult for governments to basically limit bitcoin's overall effect on the global market. I mean I could be wrong of course.

He was held for questioning. When he was formally charged, they released him on bail. 
The Japanese legal system is VERY different than western nations. You can be held for questioning for very long periods of time, under what I would call, quite severe conditions. 
He has never been found guilty and I would not be surprised if he is found innocent in his trial.

The key to bitcoin's success, in my opinion, is mainstream success. Let's look at the illicit drug trade...its huge and good money...but its peanuts to the legal drug trade. 
Roadblocks to mainstream success are rather easy to enforce at this time. No business would want to risk an audit is governments came out and said something to the effect that businesses doing bitcoin transactions will face greater risks of audits. 
The idea that a major government like the US or China would give up control of their currency willingly seems a bit out there to me. I fail to see how bitcoin would prevent the problems Greece is experiencing because they are tied into the Euro and cannot devalue their currency. But again, I could be wrong...
This would not affect black/grey markets...but those markets are tiny compared to mainstream markets.
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:10:42
Oh I agree. I highly doubt his legal team or whatever is kosher with him talking about anything.
From what I have read about the background of MtGox, I personally think the exchange was compromised before Karpeles ever took it over. I remember reading somewhere that there was a suspicion that the numbers never added up and one of the agreements Karpeles signed was to not reveal issues with the finances. 
Nor would it be in his best interest to purchase an exchange with these issues and then admit problems when he discovered them. The problem in my mind is that Karpeles had no legal responsibilities to reveal this information as bitcoin exchanges were not regulated in Japan at the time. 
This is why I don't believe he will do prison time at all....even though I personally think he should...as he would have if he were running a regulated banking or currency service. 
It hits on the whole hilarity if people complaining about regulations being applied to exchanges. If people don't want regulations...then they can't be surprised to see repeats of MtGox again and again.

Let's view this from the perspective of a supplier. Let's say I am one. I am basically taking the same risk each time I send out a package. Let's say I am selling happy pills. At a $1 a pill. I could sell them in batches of 5 or 50. Let's even say I will offer a deal of 50 for $40. Sending out two packages lowers my chance to get caught for $80 than if I send out 20 packages for $100. 
I would be smarter to move in fewer shipments. Obviously this is a rather simplified discussion and there are multiple factors involved.

I would not agree that the internet age means the end of group think. I think the opposite is happening. If all I want is information, no matter whether its based in reality or not, that supports my preconceived beliefs, I can do that. 
911 conspiracy shit, holocaust revisionism, all kinds pf crap really can be just as easily obtained on the net as proper resources, giving the false impression its as valid as historical resources. Its now more than ever easier to just take in what you want to hear.
Per bitcoin, I follow it intensively though I have never owned anything because its fascinating to watch from a sociology perspective. In particular, behaviors and actions are accepted by the bitcoin community that would never accepted by traditional banking or business entities. Its a very interesting social ecosystem to follow.

No worries. People are passionate about bitcoin and bcash. And this same kind of behavior and attitude happens on every subreddit. Like go to country or city subreddit. People flip the fuck out over stupid shit. 
I don't think i have actually said anything that should offend people, and if it does, that wasn't my intent. But if you go by the down voting I am getting, you would think I took a shit on every person's keyboard. 
I don't think the average person understands how much work it is to moderate a subreddit with any kind of user count. I am willing to bet that (just pinging you in case you want to add some thoughts about this) has a mountain of shit his way every time he wakes up. From scams, to just unhinged people ranting about something that occurred months ago...I bet you he averages about a death threat a day from just random neckbeards.

There is always a conflict of interest when it comes to message board moderation. Every sub reddit has this accusation. Go to and look at some of the crazy ass accusations that get thrown around. Even the most mundane subreddits have epic, drawn out fights over moderation. 
Mods don't get paid. So you end up with people who have a LOT of time on their hands. I'm willing to bet the vast majority of mods on reddit are unemployed shut ins. 
The idea that there is this perfect set of mods that are 100% impartial in all things...where on earth does that exist? 
I'm not trying to start a fight but come on...no one here can claim that the moderation on this subreddit is 100% impartial. TNor am I arguing it should be. This is theymos' house. You don't like it....fuck off and start your own. Same with Ver.
