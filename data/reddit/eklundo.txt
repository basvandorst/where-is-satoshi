Glad my stock portfolio has covered some of the losses (and to be fair these have only been lost gains atm) from crypto. 
Been a wild ride as my crypto portfolio was around 15% of my total assets in January to being a mere 3-4%. 
Remember to diversify guys, and not just in crypto as the correlations are really wild in these times.

The euro might end up there sooner rather than later by looking how things are evolving ... doesn’t mean that we have bitcoin-like creatures going to money museums though ��

Somehow it feels like each week we have 5-6  good days and then 1 really bad one that wipes all the gains :(

Yeah I think historically these moments have provided great returns going forward. It’s just really really hard to pull the trigger, even if I have relatively large pile of cash just sitting and waiting

Well today’s move in FB proved that there was a Bitcoin worth of air in their mcap. So in absolute terms the stock market is probably grossly more in bubble than crypto is. Most likely not in relative terms though and I guess that’s what you are after too!

Great points, thank you! 
20% from a company such as fb overnight is still something that makes you wonder how sensibly the market is pricing some stocks, even if there was new info for this co today.

Yup was distinctively talking about the difference between relative and absolute terms. The point was that if fb alone had this much air in it then the market overall likely has substantially more air than the total crypto market cap.  The scales of the markets are totally different though and so yeah it’s way clearer to think in terms of relative amounts so definately crypto is the clearer bubble
