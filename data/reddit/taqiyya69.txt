Nope, just hate twats spreading false information 
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:57:27


What? Bitcoin is 10x higher than it was last year lol, wtf are you talking about. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:00:44
They didn't get hacked you dense fuck 
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:14:18
We need a new term for this kind of dumbass speculation, something similar to FUD acronym
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:00:41
High fees, insane overevaluation. Why is this a surprise?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:11:02
I said it after the first correction movement two weeks ago. Only going down further and then sideways for a long time folks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:42:53
Hi, I'm from Reddit, believe everything I say.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:24:52
Weren't people drawing charts of this on the previous drops? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:36
Same lmao
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:39
I'm here to find the dumbass that said he'd eat his left nut once we fell to 7k. Too easy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:28
You must be new here
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:32:42
This is hilarious
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:43:33


This is most definitely not true lol.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:58
Think lower, bucky. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:38:18
Because I literally don't care. Regular stock market investing taught me in 2004 that aside a recession here and there, shit goes up, and will continue to go up until the collapse of society. The more and more people that demand bitcoin have it's place in the mainstream, the better it's chances of a equivalent collapse not happening. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:51
Damn, wtf is up with that?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:25
Where did you get that info.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:16
I would never recommend people get in on crypto unless they wanted to learn something. Luckily I do NOT have a whole lot in this game. Enjoyable, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:40:36
LOL that's great. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:05
Trezor is a cold-storage device that keeps your bitcoin as secure as possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:30
What bounce? The sell orders are still massive my dude, and coming hard. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:36:28
I bought some in at 18k lol, so don't feel bad. Out of sight out of mind for now, until it perhaps two years from now returns to 20k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:44:45
Exactly. The "buy the dip" mantra is mostly horseshit during this season of the markets, particularly on largely overvalued assets. Day traders live by different rules, but long term investing requires a lot more patience than this sub has.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:33:25
The difficulty went all out of whack for a while, something up with the blockchain. Hard to explain for me.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:10:10
What in the fuck is going on lol, did China fall into the ocean or something
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:08
Was telling people this two weeks ago lol. Don't be fooled, this thing hasn't correct nearly enough yet.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:00:25
Buckle up boys
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:00:20
Been in Bitcoin for a year, it's looking a bit fucked indeed this time of year lol.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:42:23
This is what I did back in the summer of 2017, and waking up in late November was glorious. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:35:05
Goddamnit lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:50
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:39:39


Too ironic coming from you.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:53
Because alt coins live off the energy of BTC, they are not nearly a separate alternative, not yet at least. Hold on to your asshole.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:47:53


One of the more intelligent comments here lol. People thinking it'll just level out at 8.5k are clueless. Corrections last a lot longer than a week or two, so this dive is not really that surprising. Personally I'm waiting for it to go sideways a long while before throwing more in.
