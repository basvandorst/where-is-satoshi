Everyone's saying this is incorrect (except the 2 people who have upvoted). 
What is the correct way?

At that rate, it had other values as well.
See my comment:

Its silly to compare bitcoin as a fiat currency. Its better to compare it to an asset like gold.
And for gold, my assertion holds true:
In 2013, cost to mine gold was $1305/1575/1104 for different mining companies.
ref: 
Currently price of gold is $1200.
Bitcoin can be valuable in the following ways:
* Transfer of value
* Provide Micro transactions
* Asset- a.k.a. Digital gold
At its current price, the first 2 don't hold true.
We can talk about in which other ways bitcoin is valuable. Digital gold is one way. And in that respect, bitcoin should cost ~$4000.

Cost to produce a bill is 4c but $100bn+ is spent on other things to keep the value of dollar stable. Think wars, bailouts, government bonds, economic policies, etc. The largest asset the US economy has is its dollar and they try very hard to keep it the **global currency**.

After you mentioned it, it seems like a really small amount now.
