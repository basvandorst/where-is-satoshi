This is just for shits and giggles. In case someone needed a sign from the future.

BTC relies on those holding to convince others to buy so they can make a profit. If more people are not buying than selling it goes down, down, down, which is why everyone holding screams BUY without any hard evidence that anyone should buy. Too high of a risk at this point.

I'm not going anywhere per say, I'm just betting on the bubble busting and I'll reinvest at a deep discount. Bitcoin isn't going to die, but it could become much more affordable.

This sure looks/feels like propaganda. I think a lot more people should be concerned about whether the bubble is really about to bust. Bitcoin requires more buyers than sellers in order for the value to increase. When some of the BIG bitcoin owners decide to sell off their huge numbers of coins, it will upset the balance between bought coins and sold coins, creating a huge drop in value that will be impossible to overcome. They have a price at which they WILL sell, perhaps $6500. Once it hits this number, they will flood the market with coins and a lot of people will be SOL. After the value falls $100 per coin, the same people that crashed the market can buy back right back in.
I purchased at $7400 and sold at ~$15,000 to double a few hundred dollar investment. I thought about buying back in, but I think Bitcoin is on shaky ground. Best of luck to everyone!
