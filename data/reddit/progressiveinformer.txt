Nice! I actually set up a coinbase account and I like the easy interface

I'm familiar with normal stocks and options... but from your experience how quickly can you usually buy bit coin at the price you quote and how long would it take you to then sell it whenever necessary?

I know about block-chain I'm your opinion on using that way of storing your wallet over coin base. BTC-e seems to be the day-trading ey?

Yeah definitely, man. I'm excited last question though! Even with the volatility of the price if you place the order to sell at lets say $950 and after 4(while it's processing your sell) it drops to $925 you would receive the amount at your initial sale price right?

If I had bit coin you would have gotten a tip, which I just learned how to do, sir (;
...but I don't so enjoy the intention (:

I never meant to that's why I added the disclaimer from my own experience. I find that people who are informed on his stances and effectiveness either support him die-hard or completely despise what he stands for.

I think you are mistaken. The majority of us who do not support Ron Paul, based off my own experience, loathe everything he stands for. And please don't follow it up by saying something along the lines of, "WHAT FREEDOM, LIBERTY, CONSTITUTION, GWAAHH TEH FED IS STUPID"

Like I said to that guy earlier, do you have any knowledge of mtgox.com using block chain? I noticed BTC-E prices seemed to somewhat lag behind all other markets

Any opinion on block chain?
