That is bound to happen from time to time, especially when the market is moving sideways. Congrats!

Bad idea. Potential virus.

Stay away from Coinbase!

514 coins last about 3 minutes at this pace. I agree ...don't look up!

Can you get in right now?

Clean looking site. Kudos!

Workaholic, you are the definition of douche. All you do is spew negativity. I went through the process of submitting a ticket and they declined to reverse their decision. They did tell me that I could buy more today though. So, go find your rock.

Both are good.

Document your journey and show them how you were alert enough to recognize a once in a lifetime opportunity and seized it!

How could they not be better than Coinbase!

I agree! I sold all my BTC this morning. I am going to start collecting Cabbage Patch dolls from now on.
Anyone else want on the cabbage express?

You will certainly see it fall before you see it rise. I would not be to optimistic right now.

Maybe the same people that run Coinbase are running this company. lol

I just turned 50:)
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:35:14
Whatever you do...don't use Coinbase.

Many people buy BTC there and if the price goes up they cancel your order. I had it happen to me as well. This is after several prior transaction over a few months. So, I was not even new. I turned in a support ticket and they turned my request down. They did tell me that I could buy now if I want. After the price almost doubled! Just be careful. Only buy what you can afford to lose. I have been using a site 796.com to trade futures and doing very very well I might add. Today I can't get on the server and I just read on BTC-E log that they may have closed up and left with thousands of customers BTC.
