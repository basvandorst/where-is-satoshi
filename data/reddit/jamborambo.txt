Bitcoin is volatile, but right now is even more so. I really believe bitcoin will rise abve the $907 in the next few months, just be patient. The bitcoin devs and community are facing a challenge at the moment, but thus far, they've always been successful at overcoming them. I'm not too worried.

You're argument is referring to bitcoin as a currency in this example, in fact, it is not. It is acting at a ledger from one party to another - the currency is inflationary fiat.

Please upvote for visibility. 
Although, BTC-e withdrawals may be working at the moment. There are a bunch of us who have not received our withdrawals for a whole week.
People who submitted a withdrawal request on Feb. 10-11th, have not received any funds, including myself. BTC-e support has been less than supportive and they are replying back with one word responses, not getting anything done. When we reply back, they do not respond back.
We are not sure why they are not sending us our funds, many of us were holding a lot of bitcoins in there. The following threads below are being kept current by some of us who have not received funds. In addition, I will update this post when/if I receive my funds!

bitcoin has several properties that allow it to be certain things. In some situations, it may act like a currency. In other situations, it may act like a ledger - a way of validating information and proving that things happened by the majority consensus of the bitcoin population. Other times, it may be a library to store information through it's blockchain. bitcoin isn't just one thing, that's why it's so innovating... it's really a new invention and people are still playing with it. We haven't quite figured it out yet... it's like the internet when it was first invented, then came web 1.0, we are now in web 2.0.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:31:43

Hello ChunkSty. I know, that's the thing. BTC-e has been generally good - it seems to be the withdrawal transactions taken place on February 10th-11th. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:19:25
However, companies like a crypto Western Union may use it to move wealth, money, around the world because it is very cheap and "accepted worldwide". Because the transactions would be almost instant, they wouldn't be affected by the fluctuations that occur since they would be instantly converting it into fiat currency.  In this way, bitcoin is being used as a ledger as proof of funds being transferred to one node to another.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:17:23
Acnrep2014, our bitcoins not being withdrawn is not from being hacked. This is from an error that was caused on February 10th-11th due to the Transaction Malleability issues bitcoin was experiencing.

What if we lived in a world where an inflationary currency was the overwhelming majority of trade and commerce. However, there were these new assets, "digital assets" that would be of value because of their continuous demand and scarcity. These "digital assets" also held properties that also made it easy to trade for goods. Typically, assets such as houses, gold, stocks, or other commodities were never traded for goods because you would never trade a tiny piece of gold for example - it was very difficult to do. However, because these new assets are digital and easily divisible, they could be traded in the tiniest of amounts of value, very easily by using a worldwide free network called the internet.
In addition, these digital assets spurred an entire new economy that would help to foster innovation and create jobs, wealth (from thin air), and encourage global commerce without the use of banks and absorbent fees, thereby, giving business owners more control over their personal finances with less oversight by banks and government.
The depressed world economy welcomed this innovation because it helped build a new industry in a world that hasn't recovered from this phenomenon they called a mortgage crisis where millions of people lost jobs and many people lost wealth. 
This new economy spurred new jobs from businesses called exchanges, insurance companies, escrows, crypocurrency atms, crypto consultants, traders, investment firms, web applications, television shows, and much more - it was like an open book ready to be written... and people were making money and people became happy.
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:01:51
I agree. I sent a large transfer withdraw out about 8 hours ago and still waiting.
The only thing is that I've a 100% great experience from them since April 2013 and so they have a little credibility with me. I'm not worrying too much yet.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:23:50
Show your dad this video. May I ask what type of educational background your dad has?
Also, bitcoin is not 100% guaranteed to work. It's still speculative, but in reality, I feel that it's only becoming stronger and stronger and time goes on. In addition, if bitcoin eventually fails, there's a strong chance that another cryptocurrency will take it's place.
The more I learned about bitcoin, the more fascinated I became of it's protocol. Really, it's pretty damn amazing when you really look into it. It solves the Two Byzantine General's problem and it's an invention. Literally, an invention of a new protocol just like how HTTP was for the World Wide Web.
I find that the video above is informative because he doesn't mention the $$ value of bitcoin. Try to have your dad watch that video with an open mind so that he can actually learn about Bitcoin.
Also, Khan Academy has a series that explains the Bitcoin protocol in great detail. I would encourage him to watch it if he's seriously interested.
EDIT: typos.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:15:25
Yea, sorry. Basically my post is saying that there is not need for economic law with bitcoin because it will be used as an asset, not a currency. You can use it for a currency because it's cool like that but it would be like using your Google stocks to buy coffee at Starbucks. People will continue to hoard bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because of it's deflationary value and use our inflationary currency for normal commerce.

I guess that I was expressing my POV. I always associated a President or Founder of someone running this HUGE company, so when my business is small, I feel as though I should quite "celebrate" by calling myself the Founder, etc. because I haven't "earned" that title.

Yes, every time you buy from them, they charge a transaction fee. However, if say, you want to send those coins to another wallet, they do not charge you for that. 
So, they charge a one-time purchase fee for their services. However, there really is no safe work around. You pretty much have to go through them and they are very reputable.

Hello CorgiDad,
Thank you for all your Coinbase support on Reddit.
I have a question regarding my Coinbase withdrawal (Transaction  My Coinbase account says that it was deposited to my bank account on December 5th, but I have no such transaction occurring to my bank account.
I tried to find support on your website, but it seems that there is no customer support there. Can you please check if my transaction has indeed gone through? Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:48:05
$25,000-$100,000. It's not likely, but that's a good indicator of my stance on the strength of the protocol itself (not the money aspect). Obviously, the protocol is work in progress, but the people behind and believe in Bitcoin are an amazing bunch. It's going to be hard for any one organization to overtake it - seems highly unlikely to me.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:56:40
so where are we?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:06:45
On the technical side, there is the limit of the block size and transaction speed, but those are known issues that the Bitcoin community is currently working on. If/when those problems get fixed, the applications built on top of the Bitcoin protocol should be able (in theory) to compete with the likes of Visa/Mastercard + all the great benefits of Bitcoin (too many to go over). Bitcoin seriously does have the potential to revolutionize the banking/currency industry. Thanks again for your input Matt, we need more people like you and wish you a very fruitful career in television!
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:33:33

You're looking at a graph that shows in two dimensions. Try looking at BTC prices on a log-scale to get a better understanding of it's growth.
EDIT: Oh sorry, that means I agree with CP70.

"or lost control over money moving through china borders"
This also sounds like the incompatibility of control over Bitcoin will make them disapprove of Bitcoin. Did I read your statement correctly?

That's why they have Litecoins. If you can't buy gold, settle for silver

Hi Matt,
You really are doing a great job. May I ask you a question?
The more you learn about Bitcoin, what are you feelings towards it towards a currency/commodity? I felt that the more I looked into Bitcoin, the more I realized it potential as a Worldwide currency/commodity.

Are you in US? If so, create an Account on Coinbase.com (it's just like setting up a Paypal account). They are US based and will ACH wire funds directly into your bank account.

OMG thank you! This is cool, my first tip. Learning how to accept now, thank you again!
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:15:16
Just remember, you're not the only one "waiting" for "another crash". From my experience, time is your greatest enemy. The more time that goes by, the more time Bitcoin has to pick up steam and continue doing what it does.

Ripple is the biggest scam. All the XRP were entired pre-mined by the company that owns Ripple. It's complete bullshit.

So can I ask you what is your outlook for Bitcoin in China? If there are other methods on online payment like Alipay, will Bitcoin succeed long-term in China?
@_date: 2013-05-04 05:25:33
But, if banks make money by taking the money and giving to business to to make additional money, how would this new bitcoin-fiat bank make money? Wouldn't the liquidity of fiat-bitcoin be constantly moving in and out so fast?
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:11:38
100% agree.
