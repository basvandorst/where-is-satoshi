Your evidence standard is pretty low, first, we don't know for a fact that you've used that password only on those services, second, mtgox was breached several times and the database in whole is online.

And yet when reading Zane's comments it seems like he is suggesting that Bitfinex were at fault and not BitGo, so I'm not sure.

@_date: 2016-08-04 21:20:29
I think Bitfinex is at fault here, and the choice of not having any sort of cold storage is bad. But time will tell.

It's important to note that we currently draw new transactions based on blockchain.info data we get over websocket. Since bc.i are limited to the number of nodes they are currently connected to, the information is far from accurate (at least the map part of the page).

@_date: 2014-03-03 08:55:20
I'm a bit worried about this part. Before the last statement (the one that is currently on mtgox.com) Mark said he did not include the BTC valued in the liabilities report since he wanted the court to allow them to return BTC for BTC.
Now in the last announcement the BTC value is included in the liabilities, so does that mean they did not get an approval from the court to return BTC as BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:08:36
This is true. If you print your public and private keys to a paper wallet and eliminate all other trace of information about it from your mobile/computer than that piece of paper is the only way to spend your bitcoins.
It's important to understand that deleting a file from your system does not necessarily destroy it completely etc..
Also important to take note of BIP38 (BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) which allows you to have an extra layer of security for your paper wallet by encrypting your private key using a password that you will need to either remember or write down on a different piece of paper and store on a different geographical location.

Hey guys, I'm the creator of fullnode.co. I'm working on v2 of the site and it's going to be awesome!
Currently, I've shut down the mechanism that takes donations and creates new nodes because I'm looking to implement v2 today.
Don't worry all donations will be accounted for and nodes will be created accordingly.
The new version will include many features along with the ability to fund your 'own' node and giving it a *.fullnode.co DNS name.

Thanks for your comment, I edited my comment and replaced PIA with Mullvad - Based in Sweden and also takes Bitcoin.
The fact that the rest of these services are US based does not affect your anonymity since you're connecting to all via the VPN.

You're not a party pooper, I'm aware that centralization is bad.
This is my plan to mitigate that threat:
1. Currently I support Linode which has 7 data centers (5 in the US, 1 in the UK and 1 in Japan)
2. I plan on adding DigitalOcean which has 3 data centers and also looking into Vultr which has another 6 data centers
3. I'm going to open-source the whole thing soon, so if you want to integrate to provider X, you can just write the code and to merge it into the project so anyone could use it. After I open source it, you could run a copy of your own running on other providers under your user.

When TA guys say 'There is very little support at $340' for example, how can they say that? The price is currently at $450, once it drops below $400 for example, the support at $340 will obviously be a lot bigger, so isn't saying something like that useless?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:28:18
1. Secure your wallet, please google about this part, it's vital that you apply some basic security measures before buying any coins.
2. If you buy any coins from exchanges, do not leave the coins there, always transfer them to your local wallet.
3. Don't ask 'When is a good time to buy?' - No one knows, if you believe in the technology, any time is good.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:26:38
The ordering of the new server and also the deployment of bitcoind on that server are both fully automated.

Good idea about the received funds, I'll add that.
Regarding idle machines, I'm not sure how to do it or if it's even possible to add to the scope of fullnode.co, I'll have to think about it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:14:02
I think they mean that the malleability allowed people to double withdraw coins from mtgox throughout a long period which emptied their hot wallets and in turn their cold ones (since they are refilling the hot from the cold)
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:48:23
This looks beautiful.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:47:54
Maybe I'm missing something, but when exchanges are placing funds in a user account they don't actually create a wallet for each user. Can you clarify that? You're using names in your example on github and I don't understand that part..

I'd suggest using [Bitcore]( an open-source Node.js module that was developed by BitPay. Finding address balances and incoming transactions using the bitcoind RPC client can be a pain.
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:24:26
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
1. If you logged in to your account since yesterday, it's recommended to log in again and withdraw all funds. Wait for the patch to be applied, then re-login and change your password
2. If you haven't logged in since yesterday, DON'T LOGIN, since this vulnerability exploits what's currently in the cache/memory of the server, so if you havent' logged in, your data should not be vulnerable.
Even if no. 2 applies to you, wait until service is patched, login and change your password.
@_date: 2014-05-21 06:01:22
That's a really good idea, I'm going to work on that now.
Regarding the scalability, I honestly don't know but I'll look into it.

Hey e4xit, the graph is currently a bit misleading, it shows how many servers were created at each hour, so when the number drops from 7 to 0 it means that at the previous hour we created 7 servers and this hour we created none, it doesn't mean that 0 servers are online.
I'm working on the graphs now, will update you when I'm done.
Linode does have a data center in the UK but my random datacenter selector seems to be pushing the probability limits :)

@_date: 2014-03-25 15:11:29
No, I mean when you want to spend some coins. The ideal solution is to load the TC backup to a clean, offline computer that has Armory installed. This will allow you to create a new transaction on an ONLINE computer that has Armory, then take the transaction details and load them to the OFFLINE computer to sign the transaction and then get it back to the ONLINE computer to transmit it to the bitcoin network.
If you keep your current scheme, you might have a trojan horse waiting for you to load the USB and decrypt it to steal your wallet.dat or transmit coins from your machine directly.

Well I understand what you're saying, and obviously I'm going to say I'm not planning a sybil attack.
If there's a mathematical formula that I can use to calculate the likelihood of running a successful sybil attack given a total of X full nodes in the network, I'll be happy to set a very safe limit for the total full nodes fullnode.co will ever run.
I don't really understand your last paragraph, I didn't think to myself 'oh, I wonder why this isn't being done'. I did this as a personal challenge and as an experiment. I did not think that this is harmful in any way.
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:54:58
(My) TLDR version:
1. Get a VPN account at [Mullvad](
2. Get a domain from [NameCheap](
3. Get Webhosting(VPS, based on DigitalOcean) from [BitHost](
All the above accept Bitcoin, the only exposure point is your purchase of the VPN, if you want to be extra safe, use TOR for the VPN purchase.
After you made your VPN purchase do the rest of the steps and any future communication with anything related to your anonymous website through it.

How was it stolen from your friend?
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:50:40
This is a very common question I get.
At the moment I'm using Linode to spawn new servers, I will soon be supporting DigitalOcean ($10/month servers).
Supporting new providers can be easy if they have a solid API with lots of features (as DigitalOcean and Linode has), since I need to do the server provisioning automatically with no manual processes.
So I understand there are much cheaper hosts, but I have yet to find one who is also cheap and have a robust API that allows me to perform all actions automatically.
If you know of one please tell me.

I think he should NOT take a polygraph and rather take the BTC from the fund that Andreas created and sue Newsweek.

Hey embretr, thanks for taking the time to write up some questions!
1. Yes, my personal address is: 12idKQBikRgRuZEbtxXQ4WFYB7Wa3hZzhT
2. Currently each node costs $10 since that is the monthly price for a VPS on Linode and DigitalOcean. Optimizing the cost can only come in one form and it  is to find other providers that will allow me to deploy a server for a cheaper price, but this is not easy since I need providers who offer API access points that allows me to deploy the servers completely automatically.
3. My future plans are to allow better deployments and the ability to 'blitz' deploy. So if there is currently an attack on the network and there is a need to deploy 500 nodes quickly, I would like to be able to offer that service. It's not easy but I'm planning on adding this feature at some point.
4. When you fund a new node you can only fund it for a month, in the next release I will allow you to top-up nodes so you can fund a server for 3 years if you'd like. I will also make it possible for ANYONE to top-up ANY node, so if Reddit wants to fund a node, the entire subreddit can top it up instead of funding new nodes.

1. You can generate addresses very quickly, not sure exactly what rate but it does not take a lot of cpu power to generate a bitcoin address.

Nah, I have backups of my cold storage wallets.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:29:13
You're right, it's not decentralized at all for now, I have yet to come up with a way to make it decentralized other than just explaining people how to run their own full nodes (which I actually do in the FAQs).
I initially came up with this idea because I thought it would be a good experiment.
This specific idea cannot really be fully decentralized, you will always have centers of power. I could ask people to register to Linode/DigitalOcean and other providers and basically hand me their API keys and I'll create the servers under lots of different accounts, but that's not really a good idea since it can lead to some security, fraud and other issues.
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:50:29
I agree with that BIP38 paper wallets are probably the best solution for you.
If you don't want to use that one, you could also create a wallet.dat file for each USB key and encrypt it with a password. Then send some BTC to the address and hand it out. On the USB you also include an installation of Bitcoin QT (or any other client) and instructions on how to replace the default wallet.dat file with the one attached to the USB (or you can write a small .bat file that does it for them).
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:47:40
Extremely misleading title, BTER do not enforce SSL which is really bad, I agree, but very far from 'leaks your password'.

The title is not misleading because it's not serious. It's misleading since they do not LEAK your password to anyone. They are allowing you to transmit your password on a non-https method.

You should spread your coins on several BIP38 paper wallets not because it's more secure, but because it's less vulnerable to human errors. If you made a mistake when trying to spend a BIP38 wallet, you would rather make that mistake on a 1BTC wallet and not a 50BTC wallet.

1. Click on the link the merchant sent you.
2. You will be presented with a BTC address to transfer the funds to.
3. The price is calculated the moment you click the link and the payment amount will be valid and static for the next 10 or 15 minutes (I don't remember exactly).
4. You will have to send out the payment at that time frame.
I'm not sure what happens if you click the link, then wait for the 10/15 minutes to expire and then click the link again. Maybe it will regenerate the payment amount and provide you with another 10/15 minutes.
If the amount is higher than what was expected, the payment will go through and will be marked as 'paid' on the merchant side, if the amount is less than what was expected the payment will be marked as 'paidPartial' for the merchant (not sure if you can just send the delta at that point or not). You can read more about payment states on [BitPay's API documents]( page 6.

Well when I open source it, anyone could use it to set up a 'hotwallet' and 'coldwallet' address, the hotwallet will be checked every X seconds and once enough money is moved to it, it will provision a server and move coins to the 'coldwallet' address.

That data is actually available since you can query the blockchain to see how many addresses have a positive balance.
What you really want, and can't have, is a user count. Since each user can generate as many wallets as he wants, you cannot really tell how many actual people are using Bitcoin. This is why this chart is so misleading, the title reads "My Wallet number of users".

First, remember that blockchain.info do not delete wallets, so this number can only grow.
Second, their API allows you to create a new wallet instantly, so I'm guessing a lot of services are constantly creating wallets as part of their service architecture, bear in mind these could be gambling websites that generate a new wallet for each user/deposit etc..
You could write a small script that generates wallets all day, it's kind of a useless metric.

I really think you should reconsider pulling the funds to a local wallet. Sending 50 cents over the amount is fine, but if you go below, I'm not sure what's the protocol on filling in the delta amount.
You could use an online wallet (depends on the amount you're going to spend, I wouldn't host a large amount of coins online). Some good options are: Rushwallet, GreenAddress, Copay.io, CoinKite and Bitgo.

To me, the decision to change the licensing agreement is mostly due to SatoshiLabs panic since they saw that the BWallet solution actually generated some sales.
Changing their license agreement basically does not stop and will not stop clones of using their firmware (especially Chinese clones who could care less about licensing of any kind).
What the new licensing agreement does is it alienates any developers from contributing to the trezor firmware code base. Basically developers are not even allowed to modify the code which means that if someone finds a vulnerability in the firmware, it's up to SatoshiLabs to patch that vulnerability. If the licensing agreement was less restrictive it would allow other developers to patch the vulnerability and send a pull request with the fix code.
There are in fact other license agreements that allows developers to modify the code for non-commercial use to allow patches, bug fixes and new features but unfortunately SatoshiLabs, in their panic attack, chose the **extremely restrictive** MS-RSL license.
And finally, you would think that a company that relies so heavily on the trust of their customers would be transparent in such a change and not try and falsify the commit date of their license change. It is beyond me why they thought this is a good idea.
Edit: I appreciate all the work SatoshiLabs have made, I think they have a fantastic product and team and I wish them the best, but I would personally not buy a TREZOR device with such a restrictive license.

The new MS-RSL license allows you to **view** the code, but not modify it. The previous license allowed you to modify it as well, meaning you could patch bugs or make enhancements and contribute them back to the main code repository.

You will be required to set your fees to Priority+ if spammers are using Priority fees. If the spammers are using Priority fees it means that they are spending more money for overloading the network and therefore will shorten the attack time span.

It affects security in the sense that now no one can make any modifications to the source outside of trezor employees. So if tomorrow someone finds a vulnerability in the firmware, it's up to the trezor guys to patch it and no one else can assist by forking and sending a pull requests, since doing so will break the new license agreement.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:05:59
It's not allowed, doesn't mean you cannot do it. In any case, this prevents other developers from offering new features, bug fixes and security patches because even if they fix it locally, they cannot send a pull request since by doing so the break the license agreement.

I'm not sure why bitseed are not using mhddfs instead of connecting an external drive. mhddfs allows you to mount multiple mount points into one (which is necessary if you are running Bitcoin Core).
So basically instead of buying expensive storage, you could simply buy two or three 64GB USB keys, mount them all to three different mount points /mnt1 /mnt2 /mnt3 and then use mhddfs to mount them all to /mntall for example and use -datadir=/mntall.
Also, although I value bitseed and think they are great, you could get the same result for a much cheaper price. A Raspberry Pi 3 with a case and power supply costs about $55, then you can just plug a few USB keys you probably have lying around (blockchain size is currently about 70GB) and use mhddfs to get it all in a single mount point. There are plenty of guides online on how to get bitcoin core running on RPi.

I'm currently working on a small not-yet-opensource (but will be) project that will allow you to run a REST API server that will provide sort of an alternative API to bitcoin-core with features that are more relevant to merchants.
So you could create a new payment request, verify a payment and 'secure' a payment (which is basically sending the funds to a pre-defined cold wallet address).
Later on, I would like to offer some dashboards that will allow you to do some analytics on your payments.
I would also like to allow the merchant arbitrary data into the db so he can enrich the payment data with user information, along with providing an 'IPN'-like mechanism that will allow you to get an email when a payment is either requested or confirmed etc..
Should be available in the upcoming days.

@_date: 2015-04-22 17:09:55
Well, for the moment I don't mean for this project to be a 'real' POS in terms of attaching it to hardware. But it should be hardware-able, this is why I'm focusing on the REST endpoints for now.
By working on the endpoints I can make it pretty easy to bundle or create a plugin for popular merchant services, as BitPay and Coinbase do, but without having to need these companies (at least until you want to convert your BTC to USD).
The reason I started working on this is that I actually needed this sort of thing a while ago when I wanted to sell some stuff on a website of mine for BTC. And just in the past 24 hours I've seen two more posts about this exact scenario where people are looking for easy ways of accepting Bitcoin, without having to rely on 3rd parties.
Of course, what I have in place right now isn't exactly easy to use, but I hope it will be in the near future.

Yeah but... If you ignore the price, Bitcoin is thriving. Companies are being formed, investments are being made, open source projects are constantly created and the bitcoin-core itself is getting better and smarter.

If you're a node developer with some time, I would love to get you involved in this project.
The idea is to provide an easy way for merchants to run a server that can generate payment requests, verify them and move the funds to a safe location in an easy, RESTful way. I'm not aware of any other tool that does this without using any 3rd party companies such as BitPay or Coinbase.
If you're up for it, take a look at the code and issues and send a pull request.

You can load Ubuntu from a live cd, clone the bitaddress.org repository, unplug the network cable and generate BIP38 paper wallets, set a strong passphrase and if you don't have a printer you can simply take a picture of the wallets with your phone or save the images to a USB stick. Since they are BIP38 wallets you will be required to enter a password to unlock the private key, therefore you can safely place them in a private, yet online storage.
Yes, it's still quite complicated to generate bitcoin addresses safely  without buying any hardware, but this will improve with time.

This person purchased domains and was heavily involved in public submissions on forums and mailing lists. Even if you assume that TOR is not breakable by the NSA, I find it hard to believe he never fucked by identifying without TOR to some of the services (his email, Bitcointalk user etc..).
So my opinion is, yes, they probably know who he is.

The $10 DigitalOcean server has only 30GB of storage, the blockchain + OS is over 30GB so that won't do. You're going to need to go for the $20 server. If you're going to do that, might as well let  do it for you (We support DigitalOcean and Linode and we're not taking any fees or anything).

No, solo mining will only award you 25BTC + transaction fees from the transactions included in that block if you ever manage to actually mine a block. In the not-so-near future, after quite a few halvings, you might see a reward &lt; 1BTC.

Blocks are always sequential, so block 342461 was mined before 342462. Block times are set by the pool/miner who mined the block, this timing can be a bit off. A valid block will be accepted (even) if the timestamp is 2 hours ahead or behind, more than that and the block will be rejected.

Addresses are generated offline, the blockchain does not need to 'learn' about new addresses, only new transactions. So you can generate as many addresses as you want offline but to send out coins to another address, you'll have to be online.
Once you've decided to spend a paper wallet, don't reuse it, just delete it.

Yes that would work. Just make sure to generate BIP38 paper wallets if you're going to store the keys online. The situation you're describing is called collision, you can read some more technical details about it [here]( under "Collisions (lack thereof)". TL;DR It will never happen.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:12:10
I agree that running full nodes on private machines is far better for the network, I've linked to a reddit comment that explains to detail on how to run your own full node. I'm planning on adding more providers which will add some more decentralization* but it will take some time. This website basically allows someone with zero knowledge to deploy a full node that will serve the network, it's not a perfect idea, but I thought it was pretty cool.
*kind of, since I'm the owner of the accounts on all these providers, you can say that I'm the centralized source, however it will reduce the risk of a provider who decides to block Bitcoin related traffic.

Yes, you can download the [bootstrap.dat]( file via torrent and place the downloaded file into your bitcoin data directory. That file is basically a snapshot of the blockchain up to a certain point. Downloading it via torrent is much faster than syncing the data up to that point via the wallet since the wallet creates only 8 outgoing connections.
In the upcoming v0.10 release, the client will sync within ~~10-20 minutes since it only needs to sync the block headers~~ a few hours (thanks @_date: 2015-02-06 07:25:54

Mailbit.io allows you to verify the ownership of a bitcoin wallet by asking you to send 0.001BTC to a uniquely created address.
After the verification is over the coins are sent back to you and we automatically create a mailbox for you under &lt;your-verified-btc-address&gt; 
From that point you can use that inbox to email anyone and the recipients can know for sure that the bitcoin wallet address that is used as the mail login (whatever is before the @ sign) is really owned by the email sender.
If you have any ideas on how to improve this service please let me know.

From 
"Technically speaking, mining is the calculation of a hash of the a block header, which includes among other things a reference to the previous block, a hash of a set of transactions and a nonce. If the hash value is found to be less than the current target (which is inversely proportional to the difficulty), a new block is formed and the miner gets the newly generated Bitcoins (25 per block at current levels). If the hash is not less than the current target, a new nonce is tried, and a new hash is calculated. This is done millions of times per second by each miner."

Old copies of unencrypted wallets are not useless however they are dangerous.
If someone gets a hold of an unecncrypted version of your bitcoin wallet he can take your coins since he has the private keys to your addresses. Encrypting the wallet doesn't make the old wallet files obsolete.
Back up your encrypted wallet to multiple mediums and DELETE the old, unencrypted copies.

1. Open a new account at blockchain.info wallet service
2. find your wallet.dat file (use the Windows search option if you're not sure where it is)
3. Use the import option on your blockchain.info account and upload the wallet.dat file. You will be able to access your coins while you're working to fix the downloading issue 
To try and resolve your syncing issue, try and run bitcoin-qt from command line while adding the -reindex flag. This will reindex the blocks you already have downloaded without deleting them.
If the above doesn't work you should try and remove the entire 'blocks' directory and let bitcoin-qt rebuild it from scratch.
Another option is to use a different wallet that doesn't require any syncing such as multibit (
