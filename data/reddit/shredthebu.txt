This is common and will happen again. This why ppl say hodl and buy the dip.

Welcome to bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:41:43
Most sheep can’t 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:44
Yep 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:31:45
Fuck your shit post 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:22:52
Who cares 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:47:59
How long have you been in crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:58
Satoshis are incremental units of bitcoin (like pennies of a dollar). Named after the designer satoshi nakomoto. There are 100,000,000 satoshis per one bitcoin. When people say satoshis or sats they are referring to the number of satoshis it would cost to buy a coin.

Nada tostada 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:09:04
Ok 1 week guy 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:51:46
Ok 2 day reddit guy 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:02:52
Did that with bitcoin gold and was not credited my coins. On nano s 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:07:36
That's weird. Last night I saw a post from another guy who said he was accidentally credited $7500 and was wondering if he should spend it. Ppl were telling him to delete his thread and spend it. Might want to explore that with coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:08:09
Haha ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:22:45
No one knows 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:20:14
Just send them to coinbase they will credit you both after the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:33:54
So where's the money going then?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:36:48
On coinbase do you show pending status? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:40:31
Since then he said he was kidding and gave a more conservative figure of 25k
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:26:58
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:50:43
Yes sorry got the totals mixed up. But it looks like they're making a lot of mistakes. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:05:00
These clowns think they can tame bitcoin lol 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:57:10
Nice shill, but iota is down 6% 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:58:44
You'd have to dig through his tweets 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:30:19
Lol true 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:09:04
Yes but it's not right now do it doesn't relate to where the money is going now. Which was the pint of this post 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:17:12
I sold off for fiat for the first time ever. Too much uncertainty around this fork imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:41:00
Ok thx 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:01
Me too lol wish I had it now tho
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:08:54
It will be interesting to see if there is a correction once it crosses 10k on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:24:14
Maybe sucking some D 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:54:23
Bcuz people who are asleep aren't trading or aware of the news
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:18:21
Ark and aeon are cheap right now and both solid Alts 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:14:57
Right but this isn't a fork that simply leads to a new alt like bcc. It's a battle to the death  to be king. You may be right but I wouldn't compare the two events for investment strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:59:20
Still no 10k on gdax 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:10
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:39:39
Spend half
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:17:30
Thanks for your opinion, I guess. I'm not making this up, I assure you. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:41:41
Thx ����
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:33:01
Check out my last post 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:31:36
Thanks!

@_date: 2017-09-16 03:44:29
Sure here it's is....deeznutz
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:41:29
When you say alt coins are you referring to coins like eth, lite and xmr? Or just shitty low cap coins? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:17:21
Does it bother you that vertcoins dev team only list their first names on their website and are volunteers? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:32:27
By reliable, I meant self made millionaire in the financial world, not reliable in predictions. He's no chum.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:17:45
I agree, but I said low cap 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:15:55
Thx 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:41:36
You got a nice discount 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:32:13
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:09:29
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:49:09
I heard the next fork will create a new coin called bitcoin gold. I could be wrong 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:33:42
This one is beyond my expertise, which is why I posted. But thanks for the thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:54:06
I can't read this because there's something sticking in my eye 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:45:20
Reliable meaning, he's no chum. Not saying his word is reliable 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:02:46
Does anyone know the reasons behind the previous dips? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:29:58
For the sheep maybe 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:29:40
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:39:41
What's the right sub? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:44:15
Yeah lil bitches
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:29:31
Smart man 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:44:35
Got it, thanks ����
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:30:31
So for us simpletons who just hodl...do you suggest we keep hodl'n? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:17:56
Thanks man ����
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:40:47
Depends on price but prob hodl 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:26:10
A friend of mine thinks bitcoin is old tech and is currently  simply because of its name sake. He believes some alt coins have better and newer tech and will eventually overcome bitcoin. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:48:43
Thanks! Are the private keys the 20 words I wrote down initially or do I need to retrieve them from the ledger customer service? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:39:52
Ltc is an alt
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:29:58

Does anyone know the reasons behind the previous dips? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:38:42
So if I keep my bitcoins in the segwit chain on my ledger during the fork, I will receive both coins correct?
