I lived in Margarita for several years with my Buddhist teacher. Is it possible to live there for a freelancer now? Internet/food/water/safety?

You should first kill yourself and then borrow from your relatives and invest it all. This way we will remember you as the major protagonist

Hm, no one mentions, so I will bite  
You can buy from traders there and it can be ~1-2% overcharge or you can post a buying ad and buy with profit. Imo it is 100% safe to pay someone locally with a bank transfer

non saying you should, but you can have an ad in localbitcoins.com buying btc with 1-2% discount for bank transfer. Seems safe to me. I have a bot that adjust the price though for me to be on top of the list

@_date: 2019-10-11 15:21:24
area or country?
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:29:54
shut the fuck up already

Corruption of dishonest Thai people. 100% of them would scam whites and each other given the chance. Bitcoin won't help for sure

it's a sport to dupe a farang. If there is no farang, they dupe each other. They understand Buddhism this way. Still the best bang if you know where to find it for the tip in the morning
