Running an advertisement on reddit is an awesome idea! I can't think of anything else though.

Obviously not, it's all speculative right now. Fun to watch though ;)

I would be more excited if I could somehow get some coins. I guess this is a shameless self plug, but i'm a programmer if anyone needs something done. I'm also willing to do other oddjobs online for bitcoins. Just give me a message. I'm also interested in any bitcoin start ups!

Do you know of any other legit bonus programs that the website offers?
@_date: 2011-06-07 15:35:15
Yeah, i'd say it belongs here as well. Good suggestions , I agree.

Next few years?

Unrelated but i'm curious how did you take a picture of the shot? Does your print screen not automatically get rid of the mouse in the picture?
@_date: 2011-06-06 12:59:37
Yep, got it.

They gave me .01 ;).

I'm looking for a new one though, there are so many ways it can be improved.

Ads on Japanese websites would do the trick.

Someone give me an invite too, if they please.

I remember seeing people try the same thing with Runescape gold. They would say "selling a joke , as a bonus I will include 1 million runescape gold". 
Pretty funny stuff haha.

That's pretty smart. I would capitalize on it if I were you.
