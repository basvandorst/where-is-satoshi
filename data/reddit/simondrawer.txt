So here’s the thing - both of these companies already have their own currency. Starbucks have topup cards that you can use anywhere in the world and Microsoft have their points which can be bought with any currency.
It’s more likely that bitcoin will just become another way to top up your MS points or load up your card but where it gets interesting is if the points or $* cards are values in bitcoin and become a proxy payment method for bitcoin.

Lots of people are HODLing at the moment and proudly so - if you want to know where the bottom is ask yourself what price you would switch from hold to buy and then ask your friends (tech and non tech). I don’t think 5k is the floor because it’s not a strong enough incentive to get in at 5k with a view to selling at 15k so for most people 1k would give them the potential for a good return against a high risk.
So keep holding until you are ready to buy and then you will know where the floor is.

If it got close to zero then world +dog would buy like crazy - I know I’d be buying the hell out of it at pence - and that would cause another bounce.
