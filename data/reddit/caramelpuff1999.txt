I still use lbc every once in a while. I don't know if it's just my account or not but some users have also reported 502 errors popping up. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:57:36
Definitely the worst of them all.

I agree kyc is just plain inconvenient for me and I think most people here would agree 
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:19:55
Problems like this shouldn't be normal it breeds incompetence

As someone who is still learning about crypto I think this is an interesting look at how crypto companies see themselves in the current crypto ecosystem.

You forgot to mention the trade bugs!! It's a frustrating p2p site to use

When I heard they built a school in Rwanda it helped removed some skepticism I had with bitcoin

Lots of "how to avoid scammers in localbitcoins" videos that are helpful as well.
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:53:47
I don't trust it.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:39:23
Its one of the decent p2ps out there and I bet most people can agree

I've heard no issues about paxful's wallet but people prefer storing it in a cold wallet
@_date: 2018-10-05 09:46:50
I've been trying to find that video for ages now
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:26:27
Yeah, they're the more 'decent' platforms out there. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:29:36
Yeah, its run by nigerian scammers.

I need this to be printed on a t-shirt. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:12:51
Earn how exactly 
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:18:23
Oh okay
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:10:48
Good point. I wonder why is that the case
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:55:58
I do recall reading some news bits about farmers using mobile phones to make their farming easier, it's fascinating.  
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:32:41
I need this in a tshirt or something. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:55:37
Some vendors on paxful require little to no IDs when you buy from them 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:27:39
It can be used for good and evil. I give props to paxful for going the other way.
@_date: 2019-01-30 12:08:54
One small step for man one giant leap for crypto
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:06:12
Interesting comparison.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:32:10
You buy (or sell) bitcoins from actual people using different payment methods
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:48:39
They're not even aware that bisq exists. I bet it's going to shut down in a year or less.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:43:54
It's not designed for active trading and transactions at Bisq is very slow.

If you "claim" to have tried 10 different websites, then you're clearly looking at the wrong direciton. Everyone is trading in P2Ps, I'm guessing you haven't considered those, haven't you? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:51:06
They represent everything that is wrong with crypto today
