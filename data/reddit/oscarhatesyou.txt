A couple k's worth of coffee isn't very easy to move around now is it. Plus just want a couple cups worth doesn't make sense to buy bulk just for lower fees, tescos vat is cheaper.

You clearly do not know what you are talking about. There are thousands trying to buy coffee with bitcoin at this very moment. *You just need to know what coffee is.*

There are 90000 transactions that have 0 confirmations at this very moment in time.

It's not exactly a good currency if you can't buy things because of a stupidly high fee. Plus being rich doesn't make you happy. x
