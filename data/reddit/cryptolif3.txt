If you wear this shirt and still  have a loan or bank account, then you know what you are.

You have a banking app on your phone (ledger nano). you delete your banking app (ledger nano breaks). You reinstall banking app and have to login to acces your funds ( your back up ledger that isn’t smashed you login with your 24 word key phrase). Your funds in your bank didn’t go anywhere just because you deleted the app. Same with your ledger nano s.

And coinmarketcap symbol

That’s false because whoever you bought the bitcoin from now has the fiat money

Noobs don’t want fractions of bitcoin. I get what OP is asking.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:26:57
It’s a psychological thing. Maybe when Wallets and exchanges display satoshis as whole numbers instead of .000000001, more noobies will buy it.

It could deff be their change address. I actually did the very exact thing with a coinbase change address. I messaged them a detailed explanation of what had happened and they compensated me my coins back. OP message me if you need further guidance.

I’m finally happy with my holdings from this long bitcoin drought  that FOMO didnt cross my mind once on this pump. I’m not saying it won’t go down from here, but buying at 5k is better than buying at 6k, 7k, 10k and 20k.

Binance doing the credit card thing yet?? Not sure if it’s live or not. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:29:05
Lol. Buying after a pump can get ugly real fast short term.

“Too big to fail” 
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:17:14
exactly, first it was "its too expensive now, i should have bought when it was 5k". Now the same people are saying bitcoin is going to zero and not buying any.

Wondering the same

I think it might require identification. But if you already had an account with them, then that could have been a route.

Do you have an account on the Square app? That’s another place

Exactly. If 150$ is going to save your life today, cash out. Otherwise, what’s the point.
