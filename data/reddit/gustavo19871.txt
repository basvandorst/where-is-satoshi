Lets hope were right! I'm not an expert in cryptocurrencies, but from my understanding, I do think the Bitcoin protocol was created to be flexible as far as improvements are concerned. 
Your second question: this has been a question i have been trying to answer for sometime...Does Bitcoin satisfy all that is necessary in a cryptocurrency? You may very well be right. If a Bitcoin serves as a system that readily transfers value and converts it into different value properties, then what is the need for any other crypto currency. I guess my only reason for investing in other cryptocurrencies is simply that there is value in having the "freedom" to choose other cryptocurrencies. In a way, I think, ultimately, that serves to benefit Bitcoin as well in the event that there is an effort to eliminate it. So those alts would basically make it extremely difficult to get rid of crypto currencies altogether...kind of like an insurance. 
One thing that I thought about the other day was that when I talk about Bitcoin to random people, rarely, do I talk about alt coins... 
I would appreciate any thoughts you may have into the future.

Jinx? if your telling me that i don't have the ability to post my thoughts on this thread, then I will respectfully tell you to Piss off. The fact that you worried about retaliation by moderators/bots means that you have already lost. At the end of the day, they are probably more worried about the price. So stfu.

Exactly! Having a secure system that ACCURATELY tracks the transfer of value, weather it be a worthless currency or medical inventory, is becoming more and more of a valuable asset as each day goes by.

In my opinion the professor is right. Banks will take over. They will take advantage of the opportunity...we, as individuals, will be the banks :)!
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:21:33
I think Bitcoin is valuable because it has utility as a ledger system. 
Aside from being used as jewelry, Gold is usually only traded, mostly for fiat. You normally would not trade another asset with utility, such as a house or a vehicle for gold as fiat is usually the medium of exchange. 
Ultimately, I think as long as there are other assets (with utility) that can be traded for Bitcoin, then the demand for those assets will exist using Bitcoin. 
Example: I used Bitcoin for hotel reservations in Vegas because I find hotel rooms to be useful (utility) in Vegas. True story lol.

I find it hilarious that this guy is making reference to the constitution as way to discredit bitcoin on ZDNET, a technology focused website.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:48:29
wow, I totally agree, I was just on their page and was about to donate for the first time, but couldn't. There really is a difference between using bitcoin and credit card. Given my lazy nature, I would easily have donated. Every dollar counts im sure.

In terms of the price going up, I think the focus here might be more on data. Most of us are living in societies where we are becoming more and more dependent on data to facilitate the way we live. With that comes the necessity to protect such data. Bitcoin seems to be doing a decent job so far of protecting data, which adds value to the system and to our lives. If  the government and people of Honduras are able to gain trust in Bitcoin's Blockchain system to store information about their assets, my assumption is that they will be more likely to trust the system with their money. This is assuming the volatility does remain minimal. 
Still, I have this crazy theory about what could happen specifically because of Honduras. 
As people find their spot in any marketplace as a buyer or seller, there is that one person who is more willing to let go of an asset and liquidate for whatever reason. Maybe they feel the pressure to pay bills, to save, or maybe they want to take a trip and splurge a bit. The best example I could give is a pawn shop that buys and sells all types of crazy gadgets that people ACTUALLY buy. Bitcoin, to me, is that crazy gadget of data protection. Some people are more willing to pay for a bitcoin and some people are less willing to pay for a bitcoin at a given price.
As long as there is an outlet to utilize bitcoins, to buy other goods or to exchange for their local currency (Lempira), I think there will be that one person who will chose to put their property on the market via the blockchain in exchange for bitcoin at a given price.  
I guess the main thing here is the trust that people are gaining in the system with their data, but I would definitely agree that it won't happen overnight.

Do you think the blockchain would be considered a form of energy since energy is used to transport goods?

Used it at the Taco Bell drive while reading this blog just a little ago. 
Actually, been using it exclusively for the last week because I lost my Chase Debit card and they were all out of replacement cards last weekend. By the way... has anyone walked through a bank lately, the environment feels pretty stale.

Contact as many of these groups as possible and coordinate to see how long it takes to send .2 BTC from one group to the next as a chain. The .2 BTC will end up with one of the most impoverished areas in the world of your choosing; maybe with a school, clinic, or other non-profit. I will match your .1 BTC with .1 BTC from myself.

On the second clip, looks like they wanted to correct him.

Keep your money in the bank, that earns you less return off interest than the rate of inflation. - good advice.

Good to hear about bitcoin from time to time. It gets a little annoying hearing about apple watches on every other story on CNBC. I think that's why I enjoy CNBC world haha.

im not selling, but i am using it to buy things.
@_date: 2016-01-05 08:04:31
Couldn't you compare it to gold or oil since it has to be extracted/mined via solving an algorithm?
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:05:57
I think my biggest concern is how much I would sell at a given price or how long I am willing to wait to see the price go up. To me, the opposite of buying enough is simply holding longer. According to the logarithmic chart of bitcoin, we could be seeing an approximate price of $30,000 per bitcoin on the next spike, which may seem far fetched. But it would not be the first time Bitcoin surprises everyone. If this actually happens, your friend may be faced with a dilemma of really knowing what is "high" and what is "low." This is only something she will know. 
P.S. this happened happened to me when I bought ether. I sold the majority around $2 and $3 a piece. Missed out on a lot of money (to me), but I learned from it :)

@_date: 2016-12-27 21:06:41
Bitcoin always seems to overshoot. I would not risk trying to short on a chart that is over a year in the making. The (limited) supply factor is going to play a big role, so I would expect $1000 will be pretty easy.

@_date: 2015-07-07 21:01:05
Let's see here, just some quick math. You take $3.25 Trillion lost in the Chinese stock market and divide that by 15,000,000 (just to be conservative)Bitcoins. That gives you $216,666.7 per Bitcoin. That's totally doable.

Never in the history of Earth, to my knowledge, has something such as Bitcoin, existed. There is always a chance it could go down, but my opinion is you would be investing in informational property that is only becoming more prevalent and relevant every day, giving it greater value even though it is not yet reflected in the price. A lot of people look toward the future when discussing Bitcoin's potential, and how it will change the world, but what intrigues me the most is that it is already working today.
@_date: 2016-02-02 20:39:07
This is something I have been trying to figure out myself. Right now that bitcoin it is still relatively small and has not been adopted by the masses. I would say it is not a good hedge (short term) against deflation. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that buying bitcoin now, for the purpose of saving, is where there is major illusive opportunity. 
I have a little theory that in the future, inflation and deflation will no longer be relevant because of bitcoin's liquid and transmutation properties. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:22:09

Be like a wise father or a mentor. Provide guidance to others (start ups, individual developers, non-profits) who have any form of interest in Bitcoin, when advice and guidance is sought out. And assume that they will make the best decisions possible given the foundations advice.

if this is for a general communications class, you may want to just try work on the simple aspects/benefits of bitcoin and the simple aspects/flaws of our current financial system so that maybe it will stick better.
Its funny that there are still some people that think we are on the gold standard.
Another, is simply that some people may not know that more money is printed at the discretion of a select group of people. 
To add to your mention about having money in the bank, it always reminds me that there are young people entering this world with (to an extent) a disadvantage against baby boomers or the older generations who were able to invest earlier and in more favorable economic times. Good luck!
