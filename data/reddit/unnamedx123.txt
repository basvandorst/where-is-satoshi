Thank you and bitfinex.
I have a large amount of non loaned USD, but I am happy with what this plan sounds like.
Anything to avoid all the money going lawyers and no payout to anyone.  
Hope you can make it work.

17.7% per year.... great... is something like this really being considered again?!
But then ....  'With this algorithm, the block size will exceed the current 1 MB limit during 2024'..... OMG OMG OMG?!

Please list segwit2x coin under a different name on your exchange, to avoid confusion with real bitcoin!
Y'know, the one that is digital gold, and immutable to change by whims of a few CEOs - or any other special interest groups.
Thanks in advance ;)

Exactly... agreements mean nothing!  If 90% of miners say they will mine a chain which turns out to be less profitable, then new miners will appear and mine the profitable one.  Therefore, they won't stick to what they said unless it matches what the market decides.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:36:09
True - but the fundamental problem was that unless Core was also part of the agreement, then it was going to be a contentious hardfork! 
Some people will only run bitcoin Core - the 'technocracy' path.
Some people say they will stick to the NYC agreement and run software from a completely new team/Jeff Garzik.
I think there's a good likelihood former supporters will quietly back out of segwit2x, citing the danger of a split which has been shown up by bitcoin-cash, the fact that having three versions of bitcoin is pretty insane and surely unnecessary; or some other reason.  
But if it does go ahead and core stick to their principles, I think it could be far worse for everyone than ETC or BCH, with the worst case being something like a 50:50 split between the two chains :(.  Wouldn't be surprised if ETH takes over a lot of the value, and displaces bitcoin in this scenario.

I don't think you understand bitcoin! 
Hash power follows price.  
The market will decide which version it values more, and miners will end up mining in proportion to the relative market caps.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:24:42
Hash power follows price! Mining pools intention means nothing.  BCH proves this, if you needed evidence.

None of the core developers have backed segwit2x (some have just commented "LOL"!).  These same people implemented segwit, and many other amazing improvements over the years - which required a very high level of technical ability.  So, I try to listen when they make arguments.  Also, you know very well core != blockstream. And being hard to change is a feature of bitcoin.
My only impression from their arguments (irc chat logs etc) is that they are acting in a scientific and objective way.  Have you evidence to the contrary?  Have you read this:  
And which part of this statement do you disagree with: A soft fork is safe; A contentious hard fork is a recipe for chaos!?
I don't see any scientific reason why segwit shouldn't have been activated first on its own merit (then, evaluate any next step only after gathering data and careful consideration.)  
Maybe it was asicboost; maybe it was about trying to assert control; maybe it was just about saving face!  Precisely the types of reasons we shouldn't compromise for!  
If decisions aren't made on the best objective and scientific reasons, then it puts at risk the fundamental properties of bitcoin which make different from other cloned coins, Paypal, etc :). What's next -  changing the reward schedule (because, e.g. Miners made an agreement that it is was in ~~bitcoin's~~ their best interest!)? ;)

LOL.. hash power follows price.  Doesn't matter in the least bit what mining pools 'claim' they will do.  Just look at BCH: price goes up, miners appear; price goes down they disappear again ��  Plus NYA is quite likely DOA anyway!

I love this post!  But I could swear I'm reading something from r/buttcoin's snapshillbot :)

Hold firm against the next hard fork attempt!  Whether this hard fork would be beneficial is more of an academic question - the real question is: who decides whether we must hard fork!  If the two alternatives are 'Jihan Wu decides', and we don't have a hard fork, I'll choose the latter!��

I’ve no idea really about the premine, sorry ... maybe try joining their slack channel?  I’m just hoping for some free money, if it’s going :D
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:30:04
Agree with other comments: Mark Karpeles isn’t involved in promoting b2x/Bcash/contentious hardfork so surely shouldn’t be on the list.  Haipo Yang of ViaBtc is one of the leading supporters of hash-power should decide stuff I believe, so might like a place, though :)
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:22:58
Wrong. Hash rate will follow price. If 90% of miners leave, then new miners will enter the scene and take their place.  If you needed a demonstration, just see what happened with BCH - miners committed to following NYA still abandoned mining BTC when mining BCH was (temporarily) more profitable.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:45:13
Yes - however, B2X may turn out to be DOA (if not cancelled before then) - but, there’s still ‘bitcoin gold’! ;)   For that, you need have control of your keys on October 25th apparently.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:45:35
I’m going by their website  and twitter feed   Wouldn’t seem to make much sense if they’ve already done the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:32:17
Hash power follows price.  If the market values the original chain more than the fork, then it should eventually get the greater hash power.
