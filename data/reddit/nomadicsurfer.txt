haha yes, its just a little fun side project...everytime I speak to someone they tell me "how you didn't invest 100 dollars back in 2010 you would be a millionaire today"...is just a parody app

Thanks, will look into it and change it. 
here is the google sheet if you feel like adding events that are not there:), I really enjoyed doing the research for this specially when I found the 10k bitcoin pizza and saw the original bitcointalk thread of it from way back hehe

little side project that I built today...always friends tell me if you would have invested in bitcoin back in YY year we would be rich so thought to make this little app in a few hours.

the data starts at AUG 2010 I believe, so try that query, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:46:31
yes thanks , will add an error tomorrow morning, I thought to ship it like that a little buggy, sometimes when I try to be a perfectionist I end up not shipping so I am trying to ship fast and fix as I go
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:48:48
I took out the 2010 option for now because I see most people try to do 1/1/2010..thanks for pointing this out :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:29:15
Thanks, will appreciate if you add those events if not I will also add them, getting ready to launch this site on product hunt in 30 mins :)

Hi guys, I created this open source and open timeline for major events in the cryptocurrency industry,  I can't really know all the events by myself so wanted to see what do you think about what I already added as well as if you can contribute here or in the code (open source) if you think something needs to be added..
I am trying to add macro stuff that we will see it as important 3 years from now and no micro things like small ICO hacks, etc,  that seem important now but we will forget about them in the future.

I believe now is harder because the math got harder since the blockchain got way bigger so now you can't mine with a macbook air or amazon servers and make it profitable like you could back in the day...but I am no expert.

Statistically most people who won the lottery ended up unhappy and lost the money so nope.
But statistically most people who made millions out of bitcoin is still a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:46:51
the data should start at around june 2010
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:59:30
don't worry about it, I will fill it :) 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:06:35
mine them with your computer? ;)
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:13:37
you have a point ;)
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:05:54
Hi, not sure why you put the window.alert there , try this one 
Right now you can type anything into the amount (even words) but obviously it expects a number or will provide an error... will add a validation for that later tonight, thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:52:51
Thanks, I will do that and post the link here tomorrow morning.
If you add more domains that are there already it won't matter for now, since I add them manually for now so I will double check them before adding. :)
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:04:23
Oh thanks for letting me know ,the gif was just me browsing the site and showing that it works :)

Hi r/bitcoin I created the largest job aggregator for blockchain related jobs, it will get updated daily with 100s of jobs in this space.
There are many crypto job boards online but they don’t get updated and 99% of them feature only 1–2 jobs.
I also created last months whatifbitcoin that went kind of viral and cryptotimeline, I am trying to contribute to this space in a different way and I will be launching 4 crypto startups in the next 4 months, you can read more about it here if interested

No rate limits with google, its working  here just tested it (here is video: ) ...can you please share a video here of the bug? 
It will return results for sure but right now the index has only 200 sites so for it to be better we need people to add urls 
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:49:05
To make it 1000% more useful we would need to add more domains of sites that accept bitcoin, so far I added like 200 manually but the best would be if people from the community that know more than me participate.

Hi, 
I hacked a bit with google api and launched a search engine for people that want to buy things with crypto, I don't earn anything and don't track your searches, all is coming from google.
I am on a challenge to try and create crypto apps without ICOs.. (Read more here 
) 
so far I launched cryptotimeline.com, whatifbitcoin.com, beincrypto.com and now this little search engine.
You can read more about my challenge here: 
All feedback is welcome
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:37:58
I think is very needed, I am relatively new to this technology and is what I wished to have when I got into crypto to understand the timelines and source to learn more about what happened (example the bitcointalk thread of the 10000btc pizza is amazing to go back and read)
I don't think trolls can wreck it since they will first add the events to the excel sheet and from there I will add them to the site and I won't approve pull requests for spam ;)
