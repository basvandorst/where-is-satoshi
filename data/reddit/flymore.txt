and shortly after arriving in Japan and taking over MtGox, this happened:
"Soon after Karpeles took over, Mt. Gox suffered a massive attack. A hacker gained control of McCaleb’s administrator account, the sizable number of Bitcoins therein, as well as the entire user database, and attempted to sell off more than $7 million worth of Bitcoins, driving the price nearly to zero. Karpeles panicked and shut the exchange down."

Where does he say this? I only saw the statement claiming that HIS coins were unavailable with lots of posts assuming he meant the missing 850.

Except that he's replying to the question "How much did you lose YOURSELF", he's not denying the 'apparent' theft of everyone else's.
Unless he's stated elsewhere that his customers coins are 'safe but unavailable'.
Has he?

How is it good for GocBTC holders? They claim just $64 million in liabilities. Surely that implies they managed to reduce their cash liabilities before stopping trading, presumably by buying up as many cheap bitcoins as possible. No mention of the bitcoin loss at all. 
So is it correct to say they could have been sued purely for their dollar liabilities, hence their filing for protection, but they feel/are safe from bitcoin losses?

A) Because at the moment the most likely scenario is that Karpeles is the thief.
B) because even if he turns out not be the thief, unlikely, he is almost certainly guilty of fraud.
So, Karpeles is not just "another victim"

I think so too. Read this old article on Karpeles 
"Soon after Karpeles took over , Mt. Gox suffered a massive attack. A hacker gained control of McCaleb’s administrator account."
Perhaps a coincidence, but odd timing nonetheless.

Yup, I got them too. My spam filter caught them.

I had exactly the same feeling. He looks like someone who can't believe he's about to get away with it.

Atlas?

They've been fairly quick with me, though did explain that they've ben "snowed under" with support requests following recent expansions.
I would try again.

This gives Dimon way more credence than he deserves. Why would anyone need to defend Bitcoin against someone from JP Morgan, a company that helped cause the largest financial meltdown since the Great Depression?

Yes but now the miners are threatening to raise the fees to Plenty Much Wow, and then who's going to want to send Such Currency?
