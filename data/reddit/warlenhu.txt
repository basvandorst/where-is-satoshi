I'm quite sure turning your full node on intermittently to download the block-chain then turning it off is more of a hindrance to the network than help. It's synonymous to Torrents turning off moments after it begins seeding. Since blocks are happening every 10 minutes, you'll always have to catch up to the latest block before you can seed.

A potential vulnerability that could be introduced by an upgrade/change to the protocol. That by far is the biggest threat. Historically, the developers have done an amazing job. Looking forward, any complacency in the process of upgrading all of that can change.
Regulation, Exchanges getting hacked, Poor press, Hard-Forks, Miner attacks, all of these are issues that will blow over in the long run. But if the Blockchain itself had a vulnerability and was successfully abused, you can be sure that Bitcoin will be in the gutter for years to come, if it ever recovers from it.
Many people believe alt-coins can overtake Bitcoin. But I find it unlikely, because if there really were a distributed system that works undeniably better, Bitcoin can always adapt by implementing it on a second layer.

The reality is, people don't 'truly' understand the cost of a block size increase. It is an extremely short-sighted, inelegant and irresponsible solution to an ever increasing problem. Nobody has stated that doubling the block-size is never going to happen. Nobody has stated that 1MB is the Game-theory-optimal cap. Transaction clearance is a complicated issue that will eventually be resolved by an elegant solution(s) that will not dwindle the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Until then, we can only attempt to educate those that believe otherwise.

There's merit to the "Blockchain not Bitcoin" argument. It is not a guarantee that Bitcoin would remain the dominant coin, and it is certainly within the realm of possibility for a better chain to gain wider adoption. It is just very difficult for such a situation to occur, since it relies on a radical design idea, with the designer to be altruistic and launches the coin anonymously in a completely fair and public fashion, all-the-while disappearing from the scene.
The argument "but, Bitcoin can adopt any better technological upgrades, because it's ever-adapting" can easily be disassembled. It will be very difficult to convince the entire network to fork to evolve the current form of Bitcoin to something that is better. Because "better" will never gain consensus. There are clear established philosophies that will not be changed. And as it stands, Bitcoin is aiming to be Digital gold, and that's the end of the argument.
The main argument of Andreas is that without an underlying price to Bitcoin, there wouldn't be a Blockchain. That, is what can't be disagreed with. Without a price on the coin, there cannot be a Proof-of-work. Since the entirety of PoW revolves around Game-Theory, and without a price, the Game-Theory would fall apart. But that's not to say something better can't come around, also with a price, to replace Bitcoin.
I am as bullish as most Bitcoin maximalists. But I will not be foolish enough to believe there is no chance of another digital coin taking over. There just hasn't been one that has been designed, or launched yet.

I don't believe CSW or Kleiman has nearly the amount CSW says they do (Satoshi level of holdings). But given CSW being adamant about the two having mined. It wouldn't be out of the question for them to have actually mined for some duration between 2012-&gt; death of Kleiman.
It's not uncommon for liars like CSW to drown out truths with lies that have some amount of truth to it. But I suppose it's also not uncommon for them to flat out lie about it all.
If the situation were the latter, and he has access to potentially \~10k BTC. That kind of liquidation can easily drop price by $600 if it were all sold market price.

At our current hash rate, it's unlikely to have moved enough to affect block discoveries at the linked pace. The average times in those 14 blocks is around 5 minutes, rather than 10.
Using the word "Average" here to describe this scenario is off by a bit. The proper word to use would be "Expected" time.
When using the word average to describe block discoveries, it'd be more accurately used to describe the difficulty re-adjustment. That is, after every 2016 blocks, the network would automatically adjust the difficulty based on the "Average" times in the previous 2016 blocks, to either adjust the difficulty up, or down, to create "Expected" 10 minute blocks for the next 2016 blocks.

If your friends don't make up their own mind to buy now, link them to [lopp.net]( If they still can't make up their mind, accept that and move on.

They are bets outside of Bitcoin. IE, me and you -- if we were to bet that Bitcoin 3 months from now, will be X price. One of us will take the side of, no, it will not be that price, it will be under that, and other would be taking a bet for it to be over that price.
Lets say we bet 1M dollars worth. If Bitcoin ends up below/over that price, one of us wins, the other loses. The proportion that we would lose/gain is the difference between the price we bet in the first place.  However, it can entice either side to try to push the price up/down by buying/short selling the commodity itself. But remember, there are two sides, both with the incentive of moving the market in the short term. So ultimately, Bitcoin isn't affected by the future.
The CDO's were an enabler of the housing crisis. IE, it allowed Retail banks to have the confidence to loan money to people who clearly shouldn't have been taking loans to buy a home (IE, loans taken by pets, and dead relatives).

"Being married to a bet" is definitely an extreme tag to a reasonable thought process. You're claiming that holding with a plan is good. But, is not holding for 10 years, before making a decision not a plan? There are significant amount of people that has bought-in not praying for 20x, or even 10x return over the next 10 years. This is a much more reasonable line than thinking than, "For sure this thing will explode after the next halving. This is likely to go past 50k, 100k in the next 2 years".
  
The most likely scenario is actually a long drawn out sideways movement before more institutions to begin believing in Bitcoin as a real hedge against the economy. Money Managers don't pray for these unrealistic results. And the more people that are holders of Bitcoin show that they're certain of the exponential results coming, the less likely Money Managers will buy in.

I don't think anything can really be priced in for a market like Bitcoin. Generally when people say things are priced in, they're applying traditional calculations meant for financial markets. None of those calculations can be applied to Bitcoin.
I think in order for Money Managers to really consider Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, it'd take an even more drawn out sideways movement than this 1-2 years. The longer Bitcoin stays alive, the likelier it is to become recognized as one. And the moment when the general Money Managers believe Bitcoin to be one, it will be much more than just a replacement for gold even as it stands, without Lightning Network. If you consider the potential of taking a portion of offshore-banking market, I wouldn't even dare to try to estimate the potential upside.

I'm not going to spend a whole day trying to explain why the market is pricing Bitcoin at it's current price. 
Your original statement was that we, the holders of Bitcoin, could be mistaken to the same degree that the bankers were mistaken about the Housing Market in 2008. Which is wrong, because the housing market was highly leveraged in 2008. So when pieces began to fall, everything came down with it. Whereas, Bitcoin, is primarily bought with cash.

Institutions is by definition part of the economic system. And, I never said anything about what Bitcoin was built for.
Also, your idea of "use" is likely warped. The general "use" case of gold is to store value. If the price of Bitcoin beats inflation by any % over a *long* period of time, that is already a "use" case for everyone holding Bitcoin. The question is what the definition of *long* is.

First of all, at most points in the past decade, it was a worse decision to put any money into gold, if you factor in opportunity cost of what his specialty is. And whether or not it's even better now as we speak, to put money into gold relative to more into stocks is highly speculative.
He didn't even understand how the internet would bloom out to where it is now. Why would anyone expect him to put any amount of money into Bitcoin? And 1% position for him? That is way too large for someone at his level of wealth.
I see far too many people still posting about these kind of comparisons when they themselves only got into Bitcoin for less than 3 years. And the confidence of the general Bitcoin holder still seems too high. This makes me fear for the worse, that the next halving will be the first time in Bitcoin's history to actually not break its ATH, which will certainly shake out most of these new evangelists hoping for these 50k-500k predictions. 
We need more reasonable people holding Bitcoin, not expecting the same trends to continue to happen going into the future. When the general holder of Bitcoin is okay with a 4 year sideways move after the halving, that is probably when we'll see another ATH.

You do realize that no ordinary person would ever buy a server to sync a full node right? You also realize that the bandwidth you're speaking of is not accessible to everyone that currently has internet right? The whole idea is that the full Bitcoin Blockchain is and should remain capable for the average user to sync for the foreseeable future.
Even at current rates, the blockchain is growing at 1GB every week. There will be people that were previously capable of syncing the full node to no longer being able to as time goes on. And that is the rate Core-Devs are focusing on.

You're confusing supply shock vs scheduled block reward supply. Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, that 100% of the world knows exactly when, and how much block rewards are at every given moment, plus into the 10 or more years future. There can 'still' be a supply shock on the markets. How?  
Example: Literally every person on earth now knows when the halvenings are, was, and will be. Suddenly, the three wealthiest people decide to buy as many bitcoins as they can on every Bitcoin market available. What happens to the supply then? -- There will be a supply shock, and a new equilibrium price will be presented.

The difference is, if you're making these decisions for a server cluster, all decisions are centralized to a few or perhaps one person. You can easily consolidate whatever is necessary. In the case of Bitcoin, if our Blockchain now takes the average ISP a year to sync, you'll need to get the consensus of the entire network to prune what is necessary. And we are all well aware reaching consensus is not exactly easy...

I agree, that the current version of Bitcoin cannot handle transactions at a global scale if it grows anymore. But that doesn't undermine the other utilities of Bitcoin, which is censorship resistance, and potentially it's store-of-value.
When the price has reached equilibrium (read: demand at the given market value no longer exceeds the supply at given market value) the price is still going to rise relative to fiat, because of its inherent deflationary nature. But as I mentioned Price, Trend and Liquidity isn't the most interesting feature of Bitcoin.
There is plenty of work that needs to be done for Bitcoin to be capable of handling transactions of a larger user-base. I can see the concerns of a traditional investor as the price movements are too significant to enter, when the tech isn't ready to be deployed to the masses yet. And to bet on the tech specifically on its current version is entirely speculated by people that believe the tech can work as a store-of-value. That in itself is a bet that they can sell the token at a higher price to the "greater fool".

The market cap of all tokens are a product of the Market Price, and outstanding tokens. Take BCH for example. There are a large number of tokens that are not on the exchanges to be sold (Bitmex, Coinbase etc) yet the Market Cap is still the product of the Market Price and all outstanding BCH tokens, which is the last traded price.
Imagine you had 130 billion dollars handed to you for free and you had to use it all to buy Bitcoins. How many Bitcoins can you buy? Glancing at as many order books from exchanges as you can, how much higher would the price go up, and what would the market cap then be after you put in 130 billion?

Market's aren't as rational as you make it out to be. Especially not baby ones like the Crypto market.
There is absolutely no way that the halvening is completely priced in. Why? Talk to 10 random financial advisors, or even high level executives from finance companies. I can bet you money that less than 5 of them would know that there will be a supply constraint in the next year.
Talk to 100 random Bitcoin holders, I can bet you money that less than 30 of them would know there is a block reward halvening in the next year. And of those 30, ask them what block rewards are. At least half of those wont even know what the current block reward is.

The average user isn't going to buy new hardware to sync a full node.. Why isn't that drilling into your head? As you said yourself, even the US isn't at the forefront of ISP bandwidth. How much better would it be at third world countries?
As it stands right now, scaling the network via blocksize increase is simply inelegant, and quite frankly, stupid. The utility of instant and low fee transactions is no-where near the level of sound money. And the idea is that it is possible to achieve both, without tampering with the Blockchain in the short run to do so.

Lol, if you can equate a second layer on-chain settlement solution to "reinventing the current banking system", then I can easily equate the fiat exchange to bitcoin transaction to reinventing the banking system as well. I can already tell speaking with you isn't going anywhere. We clearly have differences of opinion here and neither of us will budge.
You believe it is better to double the blocksize on demand and increase the blockchain's data size to unprecedented levels so users can use Bitcoin as if its only attempting to replace Visa. And you're OK with the dwindling of full nodes, until eventually only large Corporations and rich miners can afford to sync the full node. If you think that solution can lead to a sound store-of-value currency. Then we'll just have to wait and see. I personally believe it is inelegant and short-sighted to do so. As it stands the blockchain is already growing at 1GB per week. Each blocksize doubling will effectively double that growth.
I believe its better to keep Bitcoin's decentralized nature and keep the blockchain's data growth in a more controlled fashion. And a second layer solution will handle all micro/small transactions, while the larger transactions will still be dealt on-chain. This would maintain the sound-money aspect of Bitcoin, while eventually being able to handle micro transactions that a minority of users want.
I agree to disagree.

That's an extremely optimistic outcome of Bitcoin. There are many obstacles that Bitcoin has to overcome before it can even be considered to handle transactions at global scale. And that's not even considering the fact that Bitcoin has survive it's governance issues in the near term. Believe me, I am bullish for Bitcoin's long term outlook (5+ years). But I wouldn't try to convince myself that Bitcoin will be the end-all currency when it hasn't even begun to resolve the large number of upcoming issues.
We must also consider whether or not a global economy can function with a deflationary currency. Economic growth will be severely stumped if there are no more loans to be made with the elimination of fractional reserves.

You shouldn't assume that hardware/bandwidth would increase at the same rates as the previous 10 years. If the goal is to build a tech that will become -THE- currency, it's not elegant nor intelligent to implement a scaling "solution" that bets on the same rate of technological increases as history has given us.
Remember, the entirety of the Bitcoin blockchain will remain as is, until Bitcoin itself is dead.. That is, if somehow Bitcoin does end up being -THE- currency, all shitty implementations that are deployed and affect the blockchain in anyway will remain on the Blockchain for all of humanity....

Still a bit off. The less tokens you have at hand, the more likely you would be able to sell every token at market price. However, the more you have trying to unload, the larger the price would drop. In the example where you had 1 million tokens to sell. The average daily trading volume is around 100k tokens. Assuming half of the usual trade volume is on the sell side, if you attempted to sell that 1 million tokens that day, the volume would now be 1.1m, but 1.05/1.1=~95.5% of the volume is on the sell side. You'll likely tank the price for quite a few days (probably 20 days if daily volume is a good indication of buy volume), assuming the daily volume doesn't change (large assumption, and likely untrue, there will be mass panic further selling from public), and the buy &amp; sell demand doesn't change.
If you looked at the order books of the [larger exchanges]( you can see the orders on both sides. As you place the market order to sell or buy, you can literally see how many orders are available on each side. And if you look closely, it really doesn't take many coins to sell, or dollars to purchase to move the market price by $100/token. Of course, there are people/algorithms that will place more orders as the price move.
There is certainly a correlation between market cap, and amount of fiat invested. However, I haven't calculated or researched to what the correlation is. But as I know it, the larger the volume, the more accurate the valuation of Market Cap is. Both of us has already answered the first part to his question, what Market Cap is. But for exact answer to the second part, I'd have to say its above me. But it certainly isn't near $31b.

I wouldn't go as far as 'no one' thought. There were probably as many '1 million yen/btc' early adopters in Japan as there were here in the US.

@_date: 2017-11-18 06:18:57
The amount of money going into a the Crypto does not move 1:1 with Market cap. That was my argument against yours, that it does.
The simplest I can boil it down to is this:
If I forked Bitcoin, but caveat is only I and a friend know about it. After the fork, he and I make an exchange, of $7700 for 1 coin. The forked coin's Market cap is now 130b~ with a volume of $7700.
You claim that when BCH forked off, the price of Bitcoin dropped by roughly $500/token, while BCH was worth. But looking at any charts on Aug 1st , the day of the fork, this was clearly not the case. As the price of BTC spiked. The volume of BCH was extremely low relative to BTC during that time (~20k BCH iirc).
The recent example of the climb from 5600~7500 will tell the tale the best for you. The trade volume of BTC was at about 90k-200k (thats roughly 1b-2b) daily. Yet the market cap moved by close to 35billion. Does that not tell you enough?
The market price is completely dependent on the last trade price, which is entirely dependent on Liquidity. So no, the Market Cap is does NOT have a 1:1 (or even close) correlation to Fiat invested.

There are so many things wrong with that line of thinking that I can't even believe what I'm reading. And I'm optimistic about Bitcoin (you can read my history if you don't believe me).
How much does being a "millionaire" mean to you? With ***the*** most optimistic outcome of BTC, that statement doesn't even have meaning anymore, because fiat is out the Window. But if you put all possible outcomes on a spectrum, how likely do you think this case would be?

Your tireless car analogy isn't painting the entire picture. As it stands, the utility of a robust deflationary censorship resistant money far exceeds the utility of border-less low fee transactions. Accomplishing the latter utility by increasing the block-size tampers with the first utility. Being diligent with upgrades is key to Bitcoin's survival. Any changes that affect the Block-chain itself is permanent, and I think not enough people that promote larger blocks truly understand that cost.
If there are users that just ***cannot*** live without using a Cryptocurrency to replace Visa, then so be it. We shouldn't rush out to accommodate these users to potentially jeopardize the greater utility.

Well, if their assumption is that S1X will be the minority chain, they expect inherent replay protection to either be added to their own fork, or their own wallets to have replay protection added.

The most interesting part of Bitcoin isn't it's Price, Trend, or Liquidity. Unfortunately, that is what attracts/entertains the majority. The fundamental Macro Theory behind Bitcoin hasn't changed in the last few years, and the price is climbing yet still. The question is what portion of these people buying into Bitcoin truly believe in the Tech (read: those willing to hold on the tech, and not looking to gain a few quick dollars).
Bitcoin doesn't have a base value (read: it doesn't have intrinsic value), so whether or not it is overpriced/in bubble territory cannot be stated by anyone, unless they claim to have come up with a method of valuation that enough people can jump on board to. This is not the case, and named players (Jamie Dimon, Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio+++) claiming that Bitcoin is a scam or certainly in a bubble is a bit ironic, because if Bitcoin's tech works, and can't be valued, how can they be certain that it is in a bubble or is a scam? 
What I find interesting is that when the average Joe is claiming that an asset/financial instrument is in a bubble, and the price is still rising, is it less or more likely that it is in a bubble? Is it not possible that the average investor is now overly sensitive to Ponzi schemes and Bubbles and a tech like Bitcoin is growing slower than it could be?
What we can say with a high degree of certainty is that the tech behind Bitcoin works. There are billions of dollars on the table for anyone capable to find a vulnerability to bring the entire system down. As it stands, nobody has been able to do so, and it's looking like it may never happen if developers remain careful and diligent with implementation of upgrades.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:03:33
Mostly correct. It's just that a financial instrument like Bitcoin is so volatile, it attracted a disproportionate amount of "day traders" and "algorithm traders". And these traders were front-loaded, that is, they came into the space earlier than typical investors that buy/hold. As time goes on, and BTC's trajectory doesn't change, the front-loaded traders will slowly get diluted by investors so the price movements will be smaller and smaller percentage wise.
There will be a day when Bitcoin no longer 5-10% fluxuations, what that level is completely dependent on it's utility at that time. As it stands, BTC's largest utility is it's censorship resistance and potentially store-of-value.

Your statement is largely ignorant. The protocol to communicate between the Bitcoin network is always changing, but if someone decides to take the recent version of Bitcoin and forks off, do devs then just magically throw out a new version to compete? It takes time, and clearly that's what it will take for forked coins to slowly die off. The remains of the blocksize debate has been long decayed, yet we're still beating it.

It means buyers can, yes. But *will* is the wrong choice of word since market trends alone can't predict the movements accurately.

It's a matter of opinion at this point. Since it's too difficult to quantify in the grand scheme of things.
However, one of the most solid arguments for the utility of Bitcoin as of now is not as a payment method, but as a Store-of-Value. And that hasn't come to fruition yet, given it's drastic movements (downward if you've only been in it since late 2017 or into 2018). And if you can agree with this utility, then you're already using it, the moment you purchase it and move them off the Exchange.

Sounds like you're trying to convince yourself now, more so than actually being rational. You're telling me you'd rather pay 100$ a batch of transactions, over using Paypal or Visa which is essentially free, and faster? 
Lightning Network is still not ready for wide-scale deployment, hence the limit. And even if it were ready for wide-scale deployment, it'd be years before it can get as much coverage as Visa.
And the 100$/transaction isn't the end. It's the beginning of the high prices. Assuming Bitcoin will ever reach near 1M/BTC limits, there will come a day where it makes absolutely no sense to use on-chain transactions unless you're batching millions of dollars worth per on-chain transaction.
This is precisely why Bitcoin right now isn't heavily marketed as a means of payment, but a store-of-value. And exactly why, we have people like Roger Ver who truly believes BCH will replace Bitcoin.

Again, I am not referring to a central entity. But merely the collective who use/develop it. It was very early on, I believe 2011 or so when a Bitcoin Dev on Bitcointalk forums estimated that the cost of each transaction would be over 100$ US, if the price ever reached 1M. And that was being lenient on the demand of blockspace. There were followups by Satoshi himself. I don't recall what he said, but if you're interested you can look it up yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:17:59

@_date: 2019-04-10 15:51:48
You're missing something huge if you think the price of BTC doesn't affect the daily usage of it. 
The transaction price is a function of the supply/demand of the blockspace priced in BTC. IE, the price of transactions scale with the price of BTC at the same ratio, ASSUMING demand does not change (highly unlikely). So the 1000 sat/byte people are paying now, will still be 1000 sat/byte. I'd wager you wouldn't be using BTC as your daily driver if transactions costed you $100 USD each. 
This is a known fact, and wont be going away anytime soon (Full launch of Lightning Network, maybe).

Visa charges a fee for the merchant, and it is up to the merchant to charge the user or not. It is typically free of charge for the user and on top of that, you get incentives to use Visa to pay (around 1-5%).


When I said Visa is faster, I meant currently, not the idea of what Lightning network can eventually be (if it can). And last I checked, Lightning Network is unavailable for me to use at any stores I visit. And if I wanted to buy anything that accepted both Bitcoin, and Paypal, I wouldn't even hesitate. I'd wager that this applies to almost most people owns Bitcoin, and also has Paypal.


Completely disagree. The  argument for Bitcoin now still remains it being a store of value. If compared to gold, if BTC can take 20% of Gold's market share, it already is over 100k per coin now. And that is 'only' taking store of value properties. Not even beginning to consider it competing with off-shore banking systems that is estimated to be over 1 Trillion USD per year.


Obviously, when I mentioned "marketing for Bitcoin" I wasn't referring to a central entity, but the people who use it trying to expose it to others.


Precisely. 
And the reason why he believes BTC has changed is that he has always "marketed" it to people as a global payment system at almost no cost. Which Bitcoin currently is not, and has never aimed to be.

The question is irrelevant. Because obviously owning a huge percentage of supply has always been possible via purchasing them from exchanges. Not to mention one person owning as much as Satoshi does now, wouldn't and shouldn't change the long term utility of Bitcoin. It merely puts a potential of price being brought down temporarily (read: Bitcoin wasn't designed simply for the next decade).
And that is where the entire problem with your logic is. You believe that the potential of the price of Bitcoin plummeting justifies for a consensus to censor the creator's wallets to give people the peace of mind. Which, in my mind, is absolutely ridiculous.

There are many clashes of ideas in here. I'm going to say it no matter how cliche it may sound; Most here are correct, despite the apparent differences. In order for Bitcoin to thrive, it's going to take more than just "Hodlers". It's a terrible feeling to have spent $400 in bitcoin for XYZ 2 years ago, only to realize today that you paid the equivalent of $8000 for a $400 purchase. Hindsight bias is stronger in some people than others. It's difficult to believe that the price/Bitcoin would increase by 20x in two years, and not replenishing the spent coins then is quite understandable. But keep in mind that going forward now, the purchase you make can be replenished by buying the used Bitcoin. The Macro Theory of Bitcoin has not changed in the last two years. Of course, expecting the same level of returns is absurd, but in the end, we're expecting to beat the inflation of fiat and average market returns by significant margins.
The key point is to spread awareness of the currency, and simply hodling would discourage merchants that spent the time and resources to accept Bitcoin. And that is not something we want. If you're spending and replenishing, the net effect of price of Bitcoin is neutral. But if you take the marketing side into consideration, it ends up being a positive. With every person that ends up hearing/studying about Bitcoin, some percentage of those people will be future hodlers.

When people use the term "priced in", it applies to an investment or a financial instrument that can be valued. And there are no known or agreed upon method of valuing Cryptos. So when you say that the amount of his coins being dead "is priced in" is not true.
There are some methods of valuing Cryptos, but there is no general consensus, or even a reliable way of doing so. As such, the price of Bitcoin, or any Cryptocurrency is largely speculated and based completely on Liquidity. The price is driven on an uptrend because there really isn't many coins available to sell at current market value. If there was an influx of 1 million Bitcoins coming in the Ecosystem looking to sell at market value, and some of which comes from the Genesis Block, there will be massive FUD around that and a huge sell off would begin. And the question of how long, or if ever, it will take Bitcoin to recover I'm sure no-one can answer with any reasonable degree of certainty.

As of right now, the price of Bitcoin is $4198 and the price of Bitcoin cash is $443. So essentially, if you wanted to convert Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, you can find people to trade you 4198/443=9.476 Bitcoin Cash tokens for 1 Bitcoin. IE, BCH is trading at ~9.476:1 BTC.
When you buy a BTC on Gdax/Coinbase, and Bittrex, you are buying the current main chain of Bitcoin. If a Segwit2x Hardfork were to happen, you'll be awarded equal amount of tokens of both Bitcoin &amp; Hardfork. It will be up to the company/exchange in when/how they decide to give you the tokens.
I may be wrong about what the name will be, but the upcoming Segwit2x Hardfork is going to be the minority fork (less support overall, in terms of developers and hashrate), therefore the odds of them being worth 1:1 of Bitcoin main chain on the day of the fork is extremely low.

The US did not become a powerhouse economy of the world simply from creating and implementing the banking system. That severely devalues the work from our bleeding-edge scientific discoveries, as well as all technological advances that came from it. Economics is a very convoluted subject.

The price of BTC would skyrocket if a large number of billionaires attempt to irrationally collude to buy into BTC in attempt to crash the market. Even then, if they ended up purchasing a majority of it, as they try to sell to "crash" the market, the price would eventually end up at the same price before the collusion anyway.

If you wouldn't a carry $174,000 cashier's check with you in your wallet, you shouldn't keep 43.5 BTC on blockchain.info. It's really a question of risk tolerance. But hey, there are some people that wouldn't mind doing so.
Blockchain.info is very useful as a software wallet. That is, a means of making payments with relative ease. But to store a life-changing amount of funds in it is just silly.
Any and all hot-wallets are at risk. There is no way to guarantee it's safety, not even experienced Software Security Engineers can guarantee it's safety. No diligent Software Security Specialist would do so.

If you haven't noticed, Coinbase is taking the "less is more" approach to everything. You claiming that they have not attempted to test SegWit wallet implementation is by-and-large just a statement from ignorance. They absolutely have functioning wallet software ready to implement. It's a matter of how to do so that is most cost effective, efficient, and least likely to be litigated way.
Like I asked you earlier, how do you think the front-end interface should look with SegWit addresses? Read through my original comments and answer those questions, and even someone like you will be able to begin to see the issues that arise from the implementation of Segwit addresses/wallets. Chances are, they just simply don't want the users to choose between Segwit and Legacy addresses. Because it just doesn't look simple enough for their user-base.

This slows the network down. Since it draws the bandwidth to update your ledger, but you rarely upload to others because its turned off. 
Think of it in terms of a Torrent. You're downloading the entirety of the content, then you shut the Torrent off when you finish. Creating a net negative to the network. Try to leave your system on as often as possible, that way you're contributing more to the network. Uploading more than you've downloaded would help the most.

This mentality is exactly what the OP of this post is trying to get the message through to. 
There are definitely significant risk factors investing in Bitcoin. The utility as well as infrastructure of Bitcoin is not set up yet. The value largely comes from speculation that Bitcoin is a solid investment for a store-of-value. And some of it is betting that Bitcoin will eventually be able to become a medium-of-exchange. As we all know, that it is not the case yet. **The confidence in Bitcoin from majority of the people that hold the coins are coming strictly from past trends.** If there is a large spike drop from news that is unfavorable to Bitcoin, you can expect a mass exiting further dropping the price. Many people believe that if this were to happen, Bitcoin would bounce back in a short few months, citing the China ban news as if that is a good indicator to what will happen again if we were to enter another bear market. 
The message OP is trying to send is that nobody should be totally confident in this investment. As a result, he is trying to get people to understand that they should not invest more than they could "afford to lose". That is, leveraged long positions, or positions on margin. Because margin calls will force you to close your position at a loss.

That's only if you assume that miners in general begin selling the coins 2 years later... Which is false. 
Your original claim that "Supply and demand" is the reason is more accurate. Liquidity of Bitcoin is low. There is a small supply of Bitcoin available for sale at current market value. Which is why the price spikes anytime a few million dollars want to enter the ecosystem. These people will actually have to purchase over several different exchanges to get the coins remotely near the original market value, while driving the price up significantly. Which then triggers margin calls for short-sellers to cover, further driving the price up.
There are millions of eyes on Bitcoin/Cryptos at this point. Some of them will eventually remove them from the sidelines and enter, while others may never. But as more side-liners enter, the price will move up more, since the people exiting Bitcoin is obviously much less than those trying to enter.

I've commented on something very similar in the past so I'll copy and paste what I said then.
"In order for Bitcoin to thrive, it's going to take more than just "Hodlers". It's a terrible feeling to have spent $400 in bitcoin for XYZ 2 years ago, only to realize today that you paid the equivalent of $8000 for a $400 purchase. Hindsight bias is stronger in some people than others. It's difficult to believe that the price/Bitcoin would increase by 20x in two years, and not replenishing the spent coins then is quite understandable. But keep in mind that going forward now, the purchase you make can be replenished by buying the used Bitcoin. The Macro Theory of Bitcoin has not changed in the last two years. Of course, expecting the same level of returns is absurd, but in the end, we're expecting to beat the inflation of fiat and average market returns by significant margins.
The key point is to spread awareness of the currency, and simply hodling would discourage merchants that spent the time and resources to accept Bitcoin. And that is not something we want. If you're spending and replenishing, the net effect of price of Bitcoin is neutral. But if you take the marketing side into consideration, it ends up being a positive. With every person that ends up hearing/studying about Bitcoin, some percentage of those people will be future hodlers."

The question on how the front-end interface should look was a question attempting to get you to think about what needs to follow after you choose the answer. Apparently that failed. But I'll help you with the followup question.
If you're suggesting "no matter how it looks", I'm guessing you've now decided to migrate all funds from Legacy to Segwit because you've decided to keep the interface as is, without affecting user experience. Who should pay for the fees? Lets say you have 500k private keys of funds, do you just suck it up and pay that 3$ per transaction? Do you charge your users?
I don't understand why you're not seeing the issues that arise from the implementation when I'm practically presenting them for you.

There seems to be a gap between how you believe things ought to be, vs how things are in reality.
Large companies like Coinbase has a lot to lose. Any small change can have adverse affects. Think about it in the simplest terms, a front-end change to adopt Segwit, what would the interface need to look like? Should they include Legacy addresses as an option still?
Now, think a bit deeper, if say for example, Coinbase decides to swap to Segwit completely. Do they then move all funds from Legacy keys to Segwit keys? Who pays for all the miner fees for the transactions? Should they convert everyone at once, or over-time?
There are many issues that come along with upgrades. Quite frankly, I'm actually surprised there are people like you who haven't even begun to consider any of these problems try to publicly speak about it.

He may have been overly hostile. But his point isn't invalid. And no, his point isn't what figures OP drew on the chart. It's the fact that TA in itself is very thin (read: not significantly better than 50/50) in traditional markets. When applied to crypto it is far out of its depth.
And if it's being applied by untrained, unprofessional public to the crypto market, I'm afraid the vast majority (read: over 95%) of them are unprofitable. That is, if you factor in their entire profile in trading crypto, they would have been better off just buying and holding, rather than attempting to read charts to trade.

It's hard to see clearly if most of your knowledge comes from what others have spoon fed you. The ability is critically think isn't common anymore.
To thwart your comment: Coinbase has never outright said they'd support S2X. All conspiracy theories regarding their standing with S2X stems from the NYA. In fact, even though their leadership is generally not transparent, their CEO has come out to state [this]( This was posted nearly **three** weeks ago. It goes to show how long it takes for the babies to be fed the information.
It may be hard for you, but try to put yourself in the CEO of Coinbase's shoes. Do you outright claim to support or not support a fork, without a clearer picture? Should you be one of the first to claim so? Remember, you're the CEO of a billion dollar company. If you clearly have the option of holding out until a closer date, is there a good reason why you shouldn't? Now, you may claim that their volume has gone down in the past two months primarily because of users spreading conspiracy theories. But you need to remember that if you outright claim you will support ONE side of the fork, and the OTHER wins in valuation. What do you do then? Go back on your word? Say fuck this billion dollar business? Get a grip on reality man.

The actual description is that "there is no *trusted* third party". That is, you don't need to know, or believe that any one person or entity part of the transaction has to act in good faith in order for the transaction to happen.
The "close to free" transactions has not been true for a while now. The current utility of Bitcoin lies entirely on it's censorship resistance, and store-of-value. There are future solutions that may possibly enable low-fee instant transactions. But as it stands in the near future, the network will not support micro or "coffee" level transactions.

He's offering anyone that is willing to take the 1:1 trade of Bitcoin main chain, for the Segwit 2x Hardfork, if there is a hardfork. Realistically speaking, this is a terrible offer -- since it's practically guaranteed for the forked currency to be valued at less than Bitcoin is day of fork. People can easily sell off main chain Bitcoin for fiat, then purchase Segwit 2x coins with the fiat. And that'd be a much better rate.

Bitcoin cash's maximum blocksize is set at 8MB currently. Bitcoin is at 1mb, with the caveat that Segwit is capable of putting out effectively 2-4 MB of transactions if all addresses were moved to Segwit addresses. If BTC/BCH were to be stress tested at its maximum potential, BCH would have a max TX capacity of 2x of Bitcoin.
In the grand scheme of things, that is still not capable of handling day to day transactions of a 1+ billion user-base. Of course, BCH plans to scale out by doubling the blocksize as necessary. But the problem is that this is an inelegant and shortsighted solution. The problem with doubling the blocksizes is that the growth to the size of the Bitcoin Blockchain would exceed that of our technological storage / bandwidth growth. This leads to a relatively more centralized Full-Nodes, as typical users will no longer able to host full nodes with their at-home setups.
And the "peer to peer trust-less transactions" will end up being more centralized to entities (corporations / large companies) that will be able to afford such hardware and bandwidth. This dwindles the "decentralized" nature of Bitcoin, and as we mentioned, it is one of the key features of Bitcoin.
And to be more direct to your BCH for "Coffee" type transactions question; there are more solid alternatives. There's no reason to use a forked version of an outdated Bitcoin tech to do so.

The block-size increase debate. I agree that it should be well thought out, and prepared for to make such an upgrade. As we all know, Bitcoin now is receiving mass attention and adoption/usage is scaling at an exponential rate. The nature of exponential effects is that it moves in rates that normal people have a very hard time grasping. And it is more likely than not, that the average person that is blindly following the block-size debate to not even consider such a problem. **I just hope that the Core team has.**
As it stands now, we still have a good amount of breathing room, since we're still only at 14%~ Segwit transactions.

And where there is money involved with chance, it is within the definition of gambling.

Completely untrue. There wasn't any wide-scale adoption in 2014. Without that, the risk of the investment was much greater. In Nov of 2016 Japan announced that they were officially recognizing Bitcoin as a currency. The risk drastically changed, as that would likely increase the odds of other countries adopting it (Sweden now).
The fundamental Macro Theory behind Bitcoin hasn't changed, but the risk certainly has over the past two years.

It's all a matter of perspective. The full on cynical outlook of life has some merits to it. But ask yourself, how accurate is it? And how does that outlook affect your overall quality of life?
I use to be quite cynical myself. But as I grew older, and spent more time to think about whether or not people are really as jaded as I make it out to be. It may sound cliche, but whether you focus on the "good" or the "bad" changes the person you are and the decisions you tend to make. In the grand scheme of things, there are people in both ends of the spectrum of "good" and "bad", and often times people that lie in both ends of the spectrum depending on the situation.
I've eventually realized that it's just better to give people the benefit of the doubt. That the decisions they make that end up causing harm whether physical, financial or emotional, are all done due to a lack of foresight or understanding. Sometimes I'm right, other times I'm not. But in the end, I am happier regardless of the outcome.
As for your claim that "all the pain and suffering" derives from greed. I'd have to say I disagree. There are plenty of problems around the world that stems from "Faith" and arrogance/overconfidence.

There are some problems with this person's line of reasoning. Some of which, stems from a lack of understanding of what "shorting" is. There are some valid points he has with whether or not Bitcoin qualifies as an asset that has "Store-of-value". But lets look into it.
To begin, we have to establish a definition of what store-of-value is in the first place. I believe the following sentence from Wikipedia summarizes it well:
*"A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future."*
**Can Bitcoin be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time?** The answer is most likely, yes.
**Is Bitcoin predictably useful when retrieved?** Similarly, the answer is most likely, yes.
**And the main point, will it retain purchasing power into the future?** This question is where your friend may have a small point. Given the short span that Bitcoin has been around, it has certainly been able to retain purchasing power. Moving on into the future, it gets hazy, and uncertain, when compared to gold. But given the ongoing trend of BTC, barring any radical regulation, or unforeseen vulnerabilities this answer is also most likely yes. Especially when comparing to gold. The likeliness of more (read: let's be real, 60+ y/o investors are not likely going to sell their gold to buy into CC -- but some of that money will be shifting over) capital coming out of gold, and into BTC.
Algorithm traders are already here. Of course, there will be more coming in. But it's silly to think that they'll just "take everyone's lunch money". The only money traders stand to gain from are other traders. Not those that hold.

If money truly is the ultimate determining factor. Then I wouldn't rest assured that S2X will be the minority fork just yet. As may already know, the number of institutions that are behind S2X are still unknown. And when comparing to the current outspoken group to large institutions, they have several magnitudes more cash behind them.
I think the safest bet coming before the fork is to sit tight with both S2X as well as Legacy, to find out where the money goes into. S2X may be a bit forced, and ahead of schedule without proper testing, but if push comes to shove and institutions that are sidelined currently decide to throw their money behind S2X, the price of S2X can easy surpass the Market Value of Legacy.
Using BCH as a specific example is a bit naive. Since BCH block size increase is fundamentally worse than Segwit. But a doubling of block sizes is something that Core may eventually support anyway. When Lightning Network will be implemented is still not in the horizon. And if exposure / usage of BTC is growing at an exponential rate, the need for larger blocks to solve a never-ending mempool may be approaching faster than we know it.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding about Market Cap and actual money invested. The Market Cap is simply the product of the Market Price and outstanding tokens. And the Market Price is based entirely on the last traded price. So if you have a token with low enough volume, the token can grossly misrepresent the Market Cap of said token. Think of it this way: 
If you were given 100b dollars, you wouldn't even come close to being able to purchase all of the Bitcoins available for sale (not even including the lost/dead coins).
If you somehow magically had access to sell all available Bitcoins, you wouldn't be able to sell it for 100b dollars.
What I'm trying to say is this: It doesn't take 100b to make the Market Cap of Bitcoin.

The government isn't enabling the public from "spending beyond your means". The government is allowing banks to lend more to people who believe they make use of the loan to enrich their lives, or start their business, at an earlier time. 
This is the problem with videos and documentaries that conveniently leave out the reasons behind how the system works. Treasury bonds are sold so our government has money to spend on whatever they deem is necessary to build the US. Whether they are for infrastructure, or new agencies that will enrich the lives of Americans. And yes, some are sold for Wars that most people have issues with, and they tend to ONLY focus on that.
Fractional reserves have been painted in such a terrible light, that I cannot believe people that do such a light amount of studying simply give in and assume what they see in these videos or documentaries are the complete picture. **Imagine if there were no fractional reserves, there will still be loans, except less people would be able to take those loans.** Who do you think those loans will go to? Poor people who would likely default? Is this the system you want? Where there are no fractional reserves and the loans go to the rich only?
Yes, Economics is extremely convoluted. It's not intentionally convoluted, it just happens to be difficult to design a system where hundreds of millions of lives are at stake and keep everyone wanting to work. The system may not be perfect, but it is as far from a Ponzi scheme as it could be. In the end, it is labor that drives the economy, and people have tried their best to come up with systems to create incentives for the public to continue working. And for a 250~ year old country, I'd say we have come a long way, and still have a long way to go.

Each subsequent fork, on average, will have less demand than the last. In the short run, the money will funnel into from those that believe in these forked coins, into those that don't. Over-time this will eventually become negligible. And I'm certain there are a huge number of people that is backing S2X is looking strictly at the short run gains from selling the airdrop forked coins.
In the long run, the money that is purchasing the forked coins will buy into the "winner" of the Store-of-value coin. Which is looking to be Bitcoin anyway. At least that is my view of the forks.

You're gravely mistaken if you believe the supply of people willing to sell doesn't increase as price moves up. What do you think half of the transactions are on the network? People suddenly wanting to buy millions of dollars of merchandise with Bitcoin? It's miners, and holders of Bitcoin that want to sell because the price is moving up.
The supply increases, as well as demand decreases. If Bitcoin is suddenly 100k$ per coin, you don't think there would be massive amounts of miners that are willing to sell majority of their load, if not the entire load?

As the Supply &amp; Demand of Bitcoin changes as the price moves. IE, in general, as price moves up, there is a larger supply of Bitcoin to be sold, as well as a smaller demand for it... Hence, the equilibrium price. There were more people wanting to buy all the way from 3.1k\~-&gt; 8.3k than people wanted to sell, hence the price movement. For now we're at an equilibrium price of 7.8k-8.3k.

The idea is correct, but unfortunately only time will siphon market share from Gold to Bitcoin. Primarily because the old wealthy people who own Gold will need to pass away for their offspring to inherit their money to finally buy Bitcoin. And even then, it will only be a portion of the offspring. It may even take two generations before we see notable change.
The primary way, in my mind, for Bitcoin to gain steam in the immediate future (next 5 years) is if we have people to truly begin to trust Bitcoin to use as an alternative to an offshore bank, which will trigger larger entities (banks, countries, city-states) to buy some for reserve.
