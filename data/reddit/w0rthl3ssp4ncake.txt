The youtube comments of any crypto mining channel kill me. Every video is an all out war in the comments on blockchain tech, price, crpyto is a bubble, bitcoin has no backing, etc.

The current 8499 wall is bigger than the 24 hour trading volume, nobody has bought any BCH for over 10 minutes. 9500 is not the true price
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:59:19
Oh, I thought it would look more like [this](

2800BCH wall at $8499.03, meanwhile it is worth $3.8k USD on australian exchanges

If it still holds good value tx fees will keep it alive, if not then it becomes profitable again fro smaller miners after difficulty adjusts.

It has only just recently been featured more in the media, I can see BTC at 25k by the end of 2018, however I can also see some large scale incident knocking it over, I continue to buy though...

I would've thought the opposite after the free B2X didn't end up going around so people would be trying to get their alts back, apparently not so.

But I'm talking about the BTC stored at those inaccesible addresses, not the addresses themselves. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:04:01
better hold steady whilst my bpay tx goes through so I can get some here
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:45:00
There is no legal statement that says the rest is to follow, apart from a title.. hmm
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:37:19
This is where the idea of keeping your holdings in multiple addresses and not reusing addresses comes into play. Although technically they could still follow all your holdings it would be incredibly difficult/time consuming

Story of this sub:
Oh btc is dropping what if it never comes back
Up again def a dead cat bounce though wait and see
Crap its too high did I miss the boat
Oh jee I missed 700% gains snap it has to come down again right
Oh no I can't buy the dip because there is no dips to buy what do I do
Crap I just missed another 1000% gain what am I doing with my life
Fk crypto this shit isn't for me
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:55:15
I haven't got any of this but not 100%
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:46:34
Now I and other small miners will be held ransom to mine with Nicehash to reach the payment threshold and regain control of their reimbursement. Great.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:13:42
Then, sell after correction and buy back in at 95k

Pull back at 9950, we've seen some huge walls recently there's no reason there shouldn't be one there. Although this is crpyto so I am probably wrong like every other prediction/analyst out there
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:01:58
Right, I went full retard for a second. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:48:50
It takes balls to buy the dip, everyone can say it but in the moment covered in FUD it is quite hard.

@_date: 2018-02-21 00:09:29
Yes this is true, but they don't know who owns the addresses the coins are in, except for the one they pay to. They could be tracking coins you buy things with and hand off to someone else per say.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:46:08
USD has an inflation rate of 2%, how on earth does btc follow it

@_date: 2018-02-08 23:00:46
Difficulty is dynamic, if you were the only miner in the world, there would still be a block every 10 minutes, assuming the difficulty was instantly changeable

I ain't quitting. I don't care if my btc is worth $0 or $100,000, as long as the tech stays in development

@_date: 2017-10-19 03:42:03
I don't think we will see a price that high until after BTG and B2X forks are done and dusted.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:26:29

@_date: 2018-07-30 04:53:24
Wrong, difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, if 99% of miners dropped out of the network then the 1% remaining would have to remain the remaining blocks in the 2016 at a very high difficulty.
