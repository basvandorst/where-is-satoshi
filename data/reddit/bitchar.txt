Sorry, but also glad to know I'm not the only one. Can you recommend any alternatives?
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:10:55
Good reply,  thanks! 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:28:42
what just happened?!?
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:51:11
This is the issue i have with bitcoins. Even as a newbie I'm a convert and an 'evangelist', but it's really hard to proselytize when i can't even find a way to get them for myself haha (again, i'm overseas now. In NA it's easy)
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:39:00
Hmm,  you sound like an angry person. I hope things improve for you.  Maybe lay off the 'roids for a bit! 
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:25:45
In this case, I wasn't worried about anonymity. I just want to get some coins! I couldn't care less who knows. I can always tumble them myself.
As i mentioned before I'm overseas. There are no local ways to buy BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:05:46
Again, thank you for your reply.
I'm currently overseas. In the past I have been able to buy coins at local bank branches in Cash. That is impossible for me now.
I have two main issues with the way this has panned out, and why i feel obliged to share my experience with VirWox as a warning to others:
1. when googling around to find a way to buy BTC with either CCs or Paypal, VirWox.com is consistently one of the top options listed, everywhere. If my experience is typical, others need to be warned! Because, worst case, I've lost a considerable (to me) amount of money. Best case, I have had to spend hours emailing and calling in order to hopefully, eventually recover MY MONEY.
2. I've made three transactions with VirWox, 1 via Paypal, 2 via Skrill. Now, based on a retroactive complaint of "possibly fraudulent" activity by SKrill, I've lost access to ALL of my funds, including those deposited from Paypal.
The most miraculous thing about this is that PayPal appears to be the good guy! hahaha
@_date: 2013-03-14 15:09:50
True! That seems to be where this is heading. I would certainly prefer BTC though :p
@_date: 2013-03-15 01:34:35
For the record,  this was absolutely not disclosed up front.
This situation occurred after money had switched hands, and even after that money had been used to perform trades on their exchange. 
There seems to be a lot of hostility in this thread, some active and some passive, in the sense that I'm certainly getting downvoted.
I DO NOT have a vendetta against VirWoz.com. I just want my bitcoins.  Starting this thread felt like a PSA so that other childish newbies such as myself could be saved some trouble! 
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:34:35
I see that a lot on r/bitcoin: "you should never invest more than you can lose".
Any currency or commodity, any possession at all,  is an investment of sorts- and it can all evaporate in an instant. Ultimately speaking, you're going to lose your investment.
So rather,  "invest and be prepared to lose everything"
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:00:26
^ What he said
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:00:31
Yes, I was asked to upload scanned documents: utility bills, and a photo ID. Again, I want to emphasize, this was AFTER they had charged my accounts and AFTER i had exchanged the charged amount on their site.
I've already disputed/reversed all of the charges, so I'm moving on.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:47:16
:) this made me chuckle irl
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:54:20
Taxation isn't inherently evil- it's an arguably essential aspect of any functional society. Paying tax isn't a problem, necessarily, and shouldn't be avoided, necessarily.
The real problem is when the government doesn't represent the majority, and the majority only complains about taxation instead of doing something.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:37:18
A 10 PH/s ASIC farm. How's that for a mechanism?
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:02:57
Oh god: the stress! 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:27:41
You sound like you know what you're talking about
@_date: 2013-03-15 01:44:05
Well, I feel like there has been enough communicative from my end and very little from theirs.  I've already mentiond that, in addition to multiple emails, I've also made two long distance phone calls. Also,  if you read this entire thread, you'll notice that my account was disabled and the documents were demanded *after* the transactions and trades were already completed!
This situation is bordering on shady, "potentiality fraudulent" in their words. I'm concerned and reluctant to provide any personal documents at this point 
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:26:51
Ugh. It's really difficult to by BTC :(
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:25:24
Oh, and I guess my thought is that they shouldn't offer this service if it's "asking for trouble". It's disingenuous on their part, bordering on outright deceipt.
Also, sites like  and  should not be advertising VirWox.com as a place where people can buy BTC with PayPal or Credit Cards.
It's bad for the BTC community, especially for beginners. (I'm a beginner , and this is super frustrating)
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:49:09
thanks, i knew about the existence of that site, but it's always been more expensive than visiting a local bank branch. I'll see if they have a presence in SE asia...
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:55:56
Ok, I'm going to take this advice. I'll jump through the hurdles and keep my fingers crossed. But seriously, utility bills and photo ID over ~100USD, for an existing customer? I mean it's not like they're even providing a free service, I'm paying them a not insignificant percentage.
And this totally nullifies the anonymity of BTC...and really solidifies my conviction that we NEED pervasive bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:14:32
Sure. Look, I understand that fraud exists. But I'm not engaged in fraud. I didn't do anything suspicious, i made a total of 3 transactions of $52 USD (1 Via Paypal, 2 via Skrill), using VirWox's advertised means of depositing funds. I assume i represent a fairly typical user, and so i feel obliged to inform others.
If paypal/debit cards are so risky, then they shouldn't be accepted.
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:39:22
Wait, stop the presses, seriously?! I ALSO, separately, purchased $30 USD in lindens with a new second life account. My intention was to transfer them to VirWox. Guess what other account i can no longer log into!! Holy smoke. Collusion. I hate this shit. It's like eBay/Paypal, only maybe worse.
Oh, and my experience is that the customer support is awful. Can you imagine dropping 30 bucks on a game and then immediately getting locked out of it...with no satisfactory explanation, and no offer of a refund?
I think the Fiat&gt;SLL&gt;BTC route is a dead end
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:17:06
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:42:07
I haven't seen any real discussion about the fragility of bitcoin. There's occasional talk about a 51% attack... what about a 99% attack with a billion fiat dollars worth of asics?
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:32:15
Thanks. And again: this particular situation was merely about acquiring coins- not about doing so anonymously.
Sure, I "killed my anonymity". But these coins were intended as an investment, not for anything nefarious.
I know the protocol for anonymous purchases, but as far as i can tell those methods are very location-locked. Good luck buying BTC anonymously in Bhutan!  ha
@_date: 2013-03-14 20:33:09
Oh great!  Thanks for the constructive advice.   Unfortunately I **have** tried to get replies from them, as well as moneybookers/ skrill, both via email and long distance telephone calls.
Anyway I really appreciate your helpful and good natured reply! 
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:03:09
Well no,  taxation isn't theft.
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:49:08
Well, that's certainly a nice offer. Thanks.
I'm actually interested in buying many coins; I have a lot of faith in the currency. But I'm willing to start my collection modestly...(Virwox restricted daily purchases to $52, and I'd only been a member for 3 days...maybe i got lucky that they didn't accept more!)
Wire transfers aren't particularly cheap, and aren't reversible? Do you mean transfer via Paypal? You have some history on Reddit, so i guess i could risk sending you a test transaction via Paypal (taking fees into account) if you're willing. Maybe 3 coins worth? Or 2 or whatever you're comfortable with.
Also if you have any other suggestions for larger exchanges, in the &gt;1000USD range, I'd love to hear about them
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:23:30
Good point: what if there was a huge (unknown) investment in application specific processors, not the general purpose supercomputers Derpcoin mentioned
@_date: 2013-03-14 14:07:56
No, I am not acting like a child.
I'm a frustrated customer. I made three transactions with this company, in exactly the way they required. Then, using their service, I converted the USD that I had deposited into SLL and subsequently into BTC. Everything seemed great: they had taken their percentage, and I had managed to invest in a currency which have a great deal of faith in (Bitcoin!).
I went through ALL of VirWox.com's registration process, and provided correct contact information etc. I was willing to, and did, provide all of the information that they requested.
Now they have 2.9BTC that i purchase, and that i no longer have access to. I'm not an expert on linguistics, but my infantile understanding leads me to believe that the words "steal" or "stolen" may apply.
(a) i'm not looking for a fight
(b) sorry if you've had a bad day, i know the BTC markets are volatile!
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:29:03
I'm not convinced by your argument, but i am intrigued: Does the future of bitcoin rely on Gavin not being evil? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:05:46
I was being facetious and kidding a bit, but I'm not wrong.  Sure you can mitigate risk and diversify and whatever- maybe you'll get lucky for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:37:15
Thanks for the chuckle ;)
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:48:55
The difficulty is going to increase dramatically when BFL starts shipping. Try plugging 100 million instead of 4.8...
@_date: 2013-03-14 09:47:31
Well, so far I *have* lost BTC at VirWox.com, 2.9 to be perfectly precise. Also I was able to buy whole bitcoins, or fractions, so maybe they've changed things?
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:28:58
well, sure, there are some factors stopping me from: like, i don't want to send copies of my private documents to a strange website that's acting shady.
@_date: 2013-03-14 08:34:40
Virwox is claiming that Moneybookers aka Skrill is to blame...fun to pass the buck. So now I'm also contacting them. I'll keep you guys informed.
@_date: 2013-03-15 00:44:30
Still no real developments so a chargeback seems to be where this is headed. And you make the exact point I'm feeling: why did they take my money in the first place? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:01:34
I'm not American,  and I think you are underestimating
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:08:14
Haha!  Good one!  Next time you tell the joke you should incorporate something about a racial minority.  That would be hilarious^2
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:16:29
I understand your sentiments, and I'm frustrated too, but I think most of what you've just typed is wrong. I'm not really sure how to address all of your misconceptions  concisely and respectfully...
@_date: 2013-03-14 20:29:00
Okay, well I had apparently provided enough info for the transactions to compete successfully (I provided all of the requested information at the time of my purchase)
It was only subsequently,  that my account was locked. Without, i might add, so much as an email....
@_date: 2013-03-14 10:35:46
Yes, I think you're absolutely right about their reasons. However, as I AM a legitimate buyer, this is terrible for business.
Obviously if my account isn't restored I'm going to have the further hassle of dealing with chargebacks or whatever.
Here's the update: NOW their payment processor (Skrill) is asking for utility bills and photo IDs...this is *after* the transaction had already cleared, and i had the balance in my account! If only I'd withdrawn the BTC immediately :(
I'm debating whether or not provide them with my documentation or fuck them and initiate chargebacks.
Oh, and this whole situation is happening due to 2 $50 USD transactions! It's absurd.
