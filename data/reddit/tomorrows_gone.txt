I just went to check out a couple listed on bitcoin.com.au
Both ones I visited weren’t actual atms, the newsagent staff member had a tablet that they use for deposits to apps (like gambling apps etc) and it just scans the qr code on your phone and sends you the cash to that address. The tablet software (pretty sure he called it Blueshyft) has a bitcoin app so the newsagent takes a cut of the cash, confirms it with blueshyft and sends them cash. They immediately send you the btc in the shop.
Was pretty handy when I needed a fast deposit above coinspots daily limit. 
I assume the cash out process works almost identically. 
That model would also be much cheaper for shops that already have staff to invest in a tablet and software than a physical atm.

Your article? Pique their interest, not pick.
I agree though, well written

So I’d say we’re looking at a potential market cap between gold and stock markets . Somewhere in the range of 200-1000x.

Coinbase have a cool feature of buying with a debit card. You can also set up recurring buys, say $100 every two weeks. This strategy is called dollar cost averaging.
It minimises the risk of volatility by averaging out your buys. So if it dips next week you can buy the dip and effectively buy at the average between the dips and highs.
This is safer than putting all your cash in at one point and risking a dip straight afterwards. You can also save up a dip fund and put in 3 or 4 x more after a big dip because they’re so much easier to make fast returns on.

Do you have a plan if this goes through? You’ve just very publicly announced yourself as an excellent target for hacking, very newly rich and very inexperienced.
Stay safe. 
Diversify straight away, don’t leave all of it in crypto.

My biggest concern long term for btc is threat from other alt coins. Crypto isn’t going away but usually the first mover advantage is exaggerated with new tech in all industries but it seems especially so in crypto. There are no patents to protect btc from other crypto taking its ideas and improving on them, as so many have done. All it has is brand and trust. 
These are most powerful to newcomers, but as people become more experienced with a new technology they’re more inclined to experiment. 
I’ve seen the argument that btc only struggles with fees and transaction times because it’s got so much higher transaction volume. But Ethereum has way higher transaction volume and is doing fine. I’m a big believer in btc but I doubt it will maintain its dominance as people become more familiar and trusting of the whole crypto ecosystem. 
I’m not looking to spread fud, I’m more looking for reassurance. While I do believe in alt coins because everything is so tied to btc Im worried that if anything overtakes it and holds above it (maybe not Bcash but it won’t be the last to try) that it will be the cause of the next big dip.

Crypto20 look really legit. Have a read of the white paper on their website 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:17:25
That’s a year old. Read this white paper on the best index I’ve seen. They show that only holding btc wasn’t the best strategy in 2017.

Sorry I didn’t mean for that to sound aggressive, just wanted to warn you.

This guy dollar cost averages

Don’t give up man. If you don’t get anywhere by searching for terms then try going through folders manually but order them by date modified.

I don’t understand why people don’t understand the value of these terms. Its just an easier way to communicate a long digit string. 
To the people saying do it yourself then, or just wait this will come up organically. Why not giving it a helping hand by discussing what makes sense?
Say for instance we wanted express 0.04284510 in a way that makes sense to the human brain. 
I suggest we scrap the macro and go straight to milli. You would only ever get to 9 hundred and 99 milli bits. Just like we don’t have a term between thousand and million. Then we go straight down to micro.
So this would be 42 milli, 84 micro and 5 hundred and ten satoshis.
