sigh, are you even trying to understand or are you just dense?  look at the mining chart.  maybe 30 miners on there?  (major ones) that's NOTHING compared to the MILLIONS of users.  N O T H I N G.  what they think does NOT matter as much as the MILLION (AND MILLIONS) of users who disagree with them.  same goes for companies like DCG, barry, garzik, ver, etc.  
i was one of those people who blamed miners.  now i just see that miners are corrupt and greedy (most of them).  Core should've just done a time out flag day activation.  the fact that jihan is pressing for a  measly 2 mb HF is TELLING.
also, bitcoin cannot scale to coffee tx's with big blocks.  
also, data centers are centralization.
but you know all this.  i'm only writing this for the rest of the n00bz to see through this wizard of Oz miner bs

we pretty much know jihan/ver did it.  dont kid yourself.
and fees can be adjusted.  the wallets must've adjusted their software and haven't updated it.

too high of sat/byte.  no one uses bitcoin for daily transactions right now.  which is why bitcoin's price right now is highly speculative in my view.  listen, i agree, adoption is great and i didnt even know about this whole debate when i got into bitcoin this year, but adoption can wait compared to decentralization, the foundation of bitcoin.  i want both.  everyone does.  but it has to be done SMART.  this is the future world reserve currency we're talking about.  not some get-rich quick high school science project.

lol miners dont have a say in development.  they're paid to mine, that's it.  stop idolizing them.  it's just a FEW people doing those mining.  you sure love centralization, bro, stick to fiat.

bump this
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:36:02
lol go into all chatrooms, forums, twitter, reddit, etc.  most support Core/UASF/etc.  most do not like bitmain/roger ver/garzik/etc.   if you disagree, then i'm talking to a teletubbie
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:06:24
also, u forgot to mention how jihan/ver flooded the mempool and caused high tx fees since april.  go look at the chart.  mempool is back to pre-april levels ever since segwit2x.

Core did code it. also, segwit plus a hardfork dont' need to be bundled.  we can do segwit, wait and observe its effects independently like any rational human being/scientist.  THEN, do a safe well-developed consensual hard fork when all those observations are recorded.  
and no one is going to go to their HF coin.  even if coinbase and all the other "omg major" companies use their code (temporarily), no true bitcoiners will buy them, and they will DUMP them.
remember, bitcoiners (most) are people who are only in it for decentralization.  n00bz will find out what happened with NYA and wont even switch from fiat to this HF bitcoin.
bet on it.

nodes enforce the code.
miners just verify.
if miners want to do a hostile takeover and overstep their boundaries by trying to take over development, proof of work change will happen and everyone but miners will be ecstatic
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:27:47
no one has to use their reference client/code.  so its not force.  it's all optional.
hash power is not low.  CODE is law.  miners arent special, they are just ppl who buy hardware.  THATS IT.  developers are WAY more important.  my dog could mine.  stop idolizing.  thou shalt have no idols.

cuz he's full of shit
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:08:45
and guess what, if core activated segwit via a timeout method, then all the nodes that use Core (which is like all of them) would be using segwit and that's where the money would be.
again, i fell for the propaganda like you have.  hashpower will follow what the nodes are signaling.
and guess what, no one said core are the leaders, users are and users want segwit, not a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:06:53
there doesn't and never needed to be a compromise.  developers could've just deployed segwit without needing ANY miner activation.
you're confused.  they dont have power.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:57:26
hey, you're the one that will have to hard fork.  not us.  enjoy!
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:39:36
we will activate segwit and no one will do the hard fork.  and if they do the hard fork, most will stay with the Core devs.  Core could've activated segwit w/o the miners but did miners a kindness.  MINERS MINE, they do NOT develop.  we aren't going to put a 40 billion dollar network in the hands of bitmain.  NO THANKS.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:33:37
most of the community wants segwit.
.  Core merely proposed it, you're free to run any code you want.  doesn't mean the community will follow it.  users RULE
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:07:35
i love segwit.  segwit2x is like the federal reserve, not segwit.  segwit2x has a hard fork increase that no one agreed to except a few companies and miner who don't matter as much as they think they do or want you to think.
