Ok fair offer from your side but still a bit sad you assume I made the story up. As I mentioned the point of having multiple accs for me was to spread the (personal) informations, so with all fairness I dont feel really comfortable with giving you my other reddit accs.
At the end I dont really need to prove anything to you, also I dont really attack you. Actually I just mentioned multiple times right now I really think this is a good direction and the fact ppl discuss here more freely these topics (except your assumptions regarding me making storys up, btw what would be the point for me to do that? How would I benefit from making this up?) gives me a good feeling posting here again.

Wow... I have multiple reddit accounts. I had most of them even before I was into crypto, this one I mad specific for crypto.I subbed with 5 or 6 of them to the subs because I like to spread my activity over multiple accounts. I absolutely got banned 3 times on r/bitcoin when I was interested in BCH &amp; BTC (how I already did describe on the other comments). Look I get it, on both subreddits (here and r/btc) is A LOT of trolling going on. But man there is no doubt that there was (thats why I was surprised to see more open minded discussions here again) a crazy time going on that a lot of ppl describe as censorship in this subreddit the past years. The fact that I am actually pointing this out and at least not get banned yet and somehow there is room for diacussion gives me hope.
But please stop assuming I am a troll or lying just because it doesnt fit your view or opinion. I never made an reddit acc to get around a ban, neither did I lie about the bans. I am very very pro on an open and also critical discussion among all coins and the development around it. I even mentioned, its good to see these discussions on a more civil way back here again. I dont care about the "BTC Core AXA" or "bcash" arguments, I am here to read and discuss about critical topics in a civil way.

Tell this to my last 3 accounts that got banned on this subreddit, because I asked legit questions regarding BCH &amp; BTC in terms of scaling, fees etc. when I was new to crypto and wanted to learn and ask as much as possible. It was not political, neither conspiracy or anything. Simple technical questions... So nope, for me and as I later found out for a lot of other ppl as well  who are interested in crypto and bitcoin it was not like this the last few months here...
(at least the downvoting is still the same :))

I can understand that but its really important to hold a open minded discussion alive imo. Critical opionions on debatable topics are good as long as they are written out in a civil way and try to be constructive. This is just my personal experience that I did describe. I am not judging, but when I asked critical stuff regarding BCH on r/btc ppl at least gave me answers or gave me arguments. My banned accs here got comments calling me a "socketpuppet", "shill" or "bcash" stuff. I am not even diehard BCH, I just want to have the opportunity to ask or point out stuff thats not just hyping but also critical thinking.
I did just lurk this subreddit for a long time because I simply felt its not wished to ask these questions here and it also made me transfer more from BTC to BCH (also for other various reasons ofc). But yea as I mentioned, I am glad to see ppl can discuss BTC / BCH topics freely here without being only pro BTC. I guess thats the main point I try to make. (Sorry English is not my native language..)

Whats happening here? Why do comments like this not get removed anymore? Mods asleep or actually no more censorship in this sub? 
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:59:41
A change in the right direction!
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:07:47
Can I ask for what or why you tried to use BitPay? (honest question!)
As far as I understood it, BTC is currently not meant to be spent, but for holding as a store of value. Samson Mow, Greg Maxwell and Jimmy Song [recommend]( using credit cards for payments instead, as long as [LN is not ready](
I get that you are angry and I dont want to heat it up further. I am just looking for an open minded uncensored discussion, as I try to understand these points.
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:11:40
what about the development as itself?
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:31:26
so what does make it valuable then? Can you explain?
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:17:51
hmm why would you not try to argue based on facts with him?
These schoolyard like insults with 0 helpful input and the amount of upvotes are really sad :/ It is not even about 'taking a side' but more about how we try to argue with eachother.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:00:52
Thanks for the reply!
How is it censorship resistant if I may ask?
And also what is the difference regarding centralisation of the development if we compare the fb coin with Facebook as a company and BTC with (mostly?) Blockstream employees?


Totally agree!
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:26:36
Absolutely not! I think fb is a ridicolous fckd up company as a whole, but I like to discuss it because it willaffect the crypto community as a whole, if we like it or not!
To be fair I also see lack of these atrributes you listed up with the current state of BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-12 09:43:39
Why are you talkingabout Bitcoin Cash? I thought we talk about BTC?
Anyway, what do you mean with this?


What user revolt and what was/had to change?
Maybe we missunderstood or I did not made my point clear. I was asking regarding the development of BTC with its core developers.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:12:28
Thanks for the reply! Ok I understand the point that they only allow BitPay but I can not understand the point with the fee, can you help me?
As far as I understood it [the average fee for BTC is simply that high]( because of the 1MB blocksize limit? I mean this makes sense to me, because there is a limited amount of capacity for confirmations and with basic economic laws the price will climb (aka higher fees) or are you talking about a payment on the LN and I missunderstood you?
Sorry for delay response, I only can somehow comment every 5-10 minutes ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Yes BCH forked at block 478558 and till that block shares the same history in the blockchain and the same genesis block with BTC.
BTC and BCH both blockchains include all those 478558 blocks but after that they have different histories on their seperate blockchains. 
I hope this is more or less clear sorry :D English is not my native language...
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:41:03
It is a fundamental misunderstanding tbh. If you fork off, you still share the same history till the fork. So you also share the same genesis block.
