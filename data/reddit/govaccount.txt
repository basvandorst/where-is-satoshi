@_date: 2014-08-18 18:44:00
No, don't defend your shitty journalism practices.
Simple, check facts, then prove them. So simple. Do so before publishing. Plain and simple.
Instead just publish clearly paid for PR. Do you deny they paid for this story?
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:11:55
Another site fact checked Coin Fire.
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:34:02
Outside of the fact it ISN'T going to happen. Facebook isn't going to do this. I used to work at FB and I can assure you it isn't going to happen.
Half of the time at Facebook in the support department is trying to convince people they don't have to pay for Facebook even if a  post from "Mark Zuckserberg" (yes they always misspell it) says that if they don't post about Facebook they will have to pay for it.
They just will NOT be doing this. A team is working on a payment platform but even that is a very small team, they are looking at a more traditional route like PayPal and not using a blockchain. Can you imagine trying to tell people about a blockchain who already fight and say you have to pay for the service.
I guaranfuckingtee this isn't going to happen and is nothing more than linkbait and lies to push the stock up or down. Facebook has NOT made any official press statement regarding this.
They don't look at Bitcoin being weak and wanting to take advantage of it. You are just wrong.

I'm not sure why everyone is up in arms, this is the first place I've seen any actual like news regarding it. Like an actual thing and not just a picture or a brief statement. They actually seem to do some investigating on this site.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:49:11
Valid points.
It is up to those of us who are educated to help inform others and to further educate ourselves.
It is our hope that creating this platform will allow users to quickly see where representation reflects the views they hold and where they do not so that they can help educate our elected officials further.

I believe this after he posted the BFL exparte order before it was unsealed by the FTC:

Proof? Yo brah, search Twitter.

Unless they see this now as well and get scared.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:33:13
I had a similar experience and the bank wouldn't budge either even though I saw on the screen they very clearly had a picture of me.
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:06:56
It would be funny but I imagine that is the sort of announcement that would be very damaging for general public consensus.
The conspiracy side of me even says that they could do something like that on purpose so other politicians can come in and say, see, you can be broke in a second with a simple mistake and the masses falling for it.

@_date: 2014-07-01 07:43:39
I don't consider it a repost when they bring something to the table. Like an actual something, like some actual written words and not just a screenshot.
Do we want to see just screenshots or headlines on here or do we want to see some actual attempts at journalism with people actually out trying to get quotes?

^^ This. The call to action at the bottom is so stupidly simple. We all should tweet about this (those that have Twitter), ask ZeroBlock why they promote these guys, stop voting on the "articles" and express our dissatisfaction.

@_date: 2014-07-01 14:07:16
Yeah. I have seen a few other sites just report stuff that turns out to be completely false but after seeing the USMS coverage yesterday they legitimately have earned a die hard reader and supporter right now.
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:01:39
Hmm, that is true. I think I would still be mad. I am a member of SecondMarket as an investor and I opted to pass on this opportunity mainly because I had expected them to be over market rate but had I taken advantage of it and then found out we lost but the executives one I wouldn't be so happy because they could have pooled with us.

You do realize this is just outright false right. Google doesn't own Twitch. They are rumored to be talking to them but nothing official has come out to say Google owns them.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:30:40
I guess I might be wrong Christina. Although looking you were the first post with an actual article that wasn't just a screenshot.
I followed your USMS coverage religiously and saw even Gigaom was linking to you but it seems that bringing a new perspective isn't wanted. That said the Coin Fire site was the only one that was actually verifying information before rushing it out as I saw a few sites retract previous statements or just send them down the memory hole.
If Gigaom considers you to be a reliable source based on the stuff you've written before I think that counts for something.
I don't consider it a rehashing when you guys are bringing actual content to each piece and even reaching out to each company involved with every article as it appears you always do but I have noticed another site here is oftentimes posting small blurbs, getting tons of arrows up votes and almost never has any quotes or other news.
Perhaps that is what everyone wants though.
I noticed yours was the first post to have any substance but since then other posts with less substance but from other longer established names seem to be getting the arrow ups. Maybe keep at it and keep going until you guys and gals have built up the Coin Fire name a bit more?
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:07:02
Just saw Coin Fire report that Bitcoin Shop is confirmed as being out with a comment from the CEO. Looking like Circle a bit more and more, or perhaps someone whose name wasn't leaked prior.
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:56:44
Looks like they were ashamed about that and posted a blog entry: 
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:50:32
Facebook has made no such announcement. Someone trying to make FB stock go up?
It is logical they will try and get money exchanger status for a currency and platform they control but they haven't announced that.

They sponsor the meetup which is really cool but they aren't advocating for Bitcoin suddenly because they sponsor a meetup that just happens to be taking about Bitcoin suddenly.
That said, this is a good opportunity to tell PayPal why you want them to look at Bitcoin!

@_date: 2014-07-08 20:22:00
They don't do advertisements really but having this story at the top of the site allows the price to become further depressed and allows the shareholders of CoinDesk to purchase more coins at reduced prices. That seems plausible.
I've stopped reading CoinDesk and saw this today and had to post it. I just don't trust them...
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:07:08

Get in touch with one of the stations that air him like Chain Radio (referenced in original post). They have some pull on things of that nature as the network that provides the show does a lot to get it on stations and cater to the station audiences a bit.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:36:56
Also curious how many down votes will be from the sites called out in this piece? If they aren't above taking cash for coverage they likely aren't above downvoting this all to hell.

Based on the stuff he has written I highly doubt he was paid off but EVERYONE does have a price.

I emailed and asked and got this response:
We are going to be posting everything relevant and in plain-text format on our site in the near future. In the meantime we wanted to get something out and online and per our legal advice on something that isn't owned or hosted by us to point at later.
It might seem strange - but we are working with a very clear goal here of defending ourselves over a long term lawsuit.
If everyone will be patient we will publish everything, in plain text, all of our screenshots and everything else in due time. We are defending ourselves on multiple fronts and intend on making all of our content accessible via new means (hidden server, new backup addresses and much more) in the near future.
In the meantime we literally are just uploading the PDFs to get them out in the world.

I love how they are always granted the quotes for BitPay stories since he is invested in them, but NEVER ever are those quotes given to other sites. The PR site for BitPay has a press area but it is never updated and somehow CoinDesk always has quotes while other more honest sites are shut out.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:59:09

@_date: 2014-09-08 19:10:07
It is no secret that I have been a huge fan of Coin Fire for a really long time and i wanted to tell your team congratulations on having the full scoop hours before anyone else.
Even though this story never got a lot of traction I appreciate the fact that your team always has full scoops and is validated each time.
When anyone asks me what my favorite news site is I always say coinfire and it is because of these sort of stories.
You guys don't get any recognition at all. You broke the flowers story two weeks early, you broke the USMS auction news, you broke this and when I first encountered your site and you told me to go back to the drawing board regarding my own site before you would run a story about it I was discouraged but I keep checking every single day.
I am glad that I do because literally everything you said hours ago turned out to be true regarding this PayPal business as they are now confirming everything on the braintree blog.
Please, please, please keep doing exactly what you are doing. People might not notice but some do.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:53:58
Like all CoinDesk posts.
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:02:41
It actually seems like they've been very fast at updating that entry to include more and more information.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:37:50
We've responded adding a link to source on pastebin in case people would rather host themselves.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:04:31
Makes sense. I wonder how long before the actual announcement Coin Fire knew this information. Like was it months instead of weeks if they had originally intended to not announce it until it was closer.
Would 1-800-Flowers just roll with it though? I guess if they told them hey, things are really rolling now we should ride this wave they would go for moving up the announcement perhaps?
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:52:54
Hear that Coin Fire? In all seriousness though that is true.
Can you make it easier to submit your articles with making the reddit button stick out on your articles or something?
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:46:34
Umm, they still haven't addressed the fact they lied before, deleted the posts and then called Coin Fire out for getting quotes that didn't fit the narrative josh has put out.
Please, explain to me how this disproves what Coin Fire reported? Especially when the CEO of Authy confirmed the validity of his quote publicly on Twitter now?
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:08:55
Hey, right, remember when a bunch of people called this out as total bullshit and said OH NO GOOGLE OWNS them and then downvoted anyone who disagreed.
Oh yeah, we were all right. Don't trust news from "unconfirmed" sources.

They seem to agree: 
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:51:29
Whoa. Got escalated to someone in the United States who said, no partnership, no relationship.
Said it seemed to be legit then later would say it isn't related to Amazon and Amazon isn't responsible if I get ripped off.
This certainly lends itself well to the fact that GAW has ZERO relationship with Amazon and just because it looks legit doesn't mean Amazon can help me when they rip you off.
EDIT: P.S I order HUNDREDS of items on Amazon often. Hence why I get the large order team instead of the regular non-US chat people.

It is. It takes but five minutes to make a call. I did it after the article came out and got confirmation what was being said was true.
If your style of "journalism" at CCN is to just Google something than you aren't doing anything even remotely close to journalism.
It never ceases without fail that the only "news" site that comes to the defense of GAW on a regular basis is CCN. Scott, you and that other guy exposed the other night asking Coin Fire to be silenced by legal threats.
You guys are pure scum and people are starting to see that.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:07:07
Of course it is going down when the BTC address associated with GAW Miners is suddenly moving ALL of it's bitcoins to exchange addresses. He is clearly dumping all of his BTC.

That isn't instant though. I'm curious if the OP is putting the emphasis on instant here.
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:28:43
Weird. Florida has a license specifically called the MSB license. A quick call to the relevant officials in the state proved that.
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:59:33
False. That is for federal items. Some states require a license before you actually begin your MSB activities.
This wasn't a report regarding other exchanges, it was about PayBase specifically.
Good luck getting one in thirty minutes in some states.
They exchanged fiat to BTC / XPY via credit cards. Florida has already said it considers that MSB activity.
Perhaps the people at GAW should check laws a bit closer. I can't speak to the other exchanges but we know GAW is under increased scrutiny so this can't bode well for them.
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:27:48
Also note that several CCN authors have come out and started trolling the Coin Fire comments on various posts over the last 24 hours.
These guys are clearly bought and paid for by Josh Garza himself and seem to be the only ones constantly on the defense and offense against anything negative about Garza or the CCN site.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:52:06
They are likely skirting the law as well if they are in the US and it is only a matter of time before something happens.
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:59:56
They do BTC exchanging.
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:59:45
Yet, it still will blow up on them.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:54:38
No, it is an issue. Just the other exchanges haven't seen the regulatory banhammer come down.... yet.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:41:59
I just emailed them about accepting BTC. They have done some great work in the past.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:51:25
Dude, they don't have 180 days in each state.
Each state isn't the same.
How is this at the expense of our community? Leave it to *another* CCN writer to quickly come to the defense of GAW.
Do some real journalism. Call the states yourself. I just called Florida myself and got them to tell me they require registration IMMEDIATELY and that Paybase, LLC is NOT registered and hasn't even put in an application.
Coin Fire provided the relevant information for others to call themselves. How hard is it to pick up a telephone? Do all CCN authors need another site to do the work for them?
The best outcome for bitcoin is that scams like this be exposed.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:01:44
Please ask people to stop using Shapeshift.io since they are helping to promote this scam.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:35:45
Great advice! Going to check them out!
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:54:11
We don't know because GAW isn't being clear who the customers are but they likely don't have KYC for all of them so some states such as Florida can allege that without the KYC documents they could have sold to Florida residents and been in violation of the law.
Just because you register with the Feds doesn't make you immune to the state laws. I think Coin Fire did a good job highlighting the fact they DID get federal paperwork and even uploaded it for all to see.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:13:55
If the site was *instant* and I could have the card in my email or in my browser immediately with zero delays I'd be willing to pay $1 for that convenience.
1. Saves me from going to store.
2. I can use bitcoin.
I'd rather they be direct purchases instead of a marketplace though. In marketplace situations it is possible the other person wrote the card number down before selling it to the site and that makes me uncomfortable.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:54:20
As a fan - follower - and supporter of Coin Fire I have personally text him today and can verify this is his reddit account and a reddit post from the man himself.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:23:55
Can confirm. Gyft has decided BTC isn't viable and is partnered with GAW for Paycoin.
Holy shit. I'll be using eGifter moving forward.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:52:33
Doesn't matter. They will all see penalties eventually if the laws aren't changed.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:38:54
Great idea! I am opening a live chat session now and will post my results. I will play dumb and ask if that site is safe and promises me 10% off.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:53:14
If nothing else it gets it on the radar at Amazon further so if it is the truth it will come out and if it is a scam or a lie it will come out sooner.
This could go either way but based on the chat I just had it sounds like it might be a scam.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:52:21

They've published things in the past that back the claims they make. For example they published a piece about a live raid taking place at BFL. A few days later they tweeted a picture of sealed court documents, then a few days later the documents were made public by the FTC.
I have been a fan of coinfire work for a while now. They can't just publish things that would jeaporidze live sources. They always come through though when the time is right.
They were right about coinjelly, they were right about BFL, they were right about the SEC letters, they have been right over and over. I'm inclined to believe they have something but have to wait on releasing the floodgates.
They promised this look inside the editorial process months ago and they made good on it. Rome wasn't built in a day.

Weird, I remember the BFL stuff being posted on Twitter before it was anywhere else by Coin Fire.
I still believe the statements although valid points about not naming them.
I think my concerns are still who are the coin fire people that they have the connections that I think they clearly have.
