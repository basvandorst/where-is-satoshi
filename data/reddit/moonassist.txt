Yeah, maybe you are right. But let's compare Europe with the US. In Europe they are more like: let's give it some space and see where all of this is going and the US just want to control all of it without giving it enough space imho. I feel that in Europe they are more open for this new form of currencies incl the freedom around it.

GDAX/Coinbase works like a charm. Withdrawls are done pretty quickly.

LOL, that's pretty harsh, but I feel you! But what about Day/Swing traders? Should they move all of their crypto to cold ledgers? That's probably pretty hard to do right?

I feel you on this one, let's see what the future brings us.

We've already heared so much predictions from so called experts. I believe the only thing we can do is wait and see, right?

Awesome! How long do you think it will take till we see some mass adoption? How cool would it be if McDonalds or Burger King accepts this! Imho crypto is still on the verge of becomming huge.

Yea, still questioning myself what people actually prefer. You have a fair point by stating that genuine exchanges are doing whatever they can to protect our assets. But cause they are owning it they are also an easier target, right? Not saying that it's easy to steal stuff but everyone knows how much an exchange actually has. Are all exchanges securing our assets like ie Binance, GDAX, OkEx?

Why do you think so, any TA for us?

Imho 2019 will be the year of the DEXs!

Interesting way of looking at it, but I believe you are right. There is actually a big difference between. For now it seems unavoidable as you said, but let's look at the future. Will we still use fiat money in 10 years? Let's say we are not, how would that governance involvement/control look like by then? The whole idea behind cryptocurrencies is about giving control to the people instead governments.

Who cares, now people can laugh twice! This one keeps being classic :D

Let's hope so!

I think it's not a matter of useless or not right? It's all about the value that coins are having.

Crypto is created for the citizens of the world **without** government regulations. We should be in control!
