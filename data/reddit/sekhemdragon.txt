And I'm sure good counterarguments exist, if you actually told us what these valid criticisms are.

yes.  Cosmic rays up the wazoo.

So if white people in SA sold all their property, bought BTC and left, you'd be happy with that outcome?  I mean in the fantasy scenario where China doesn't take over, and colonize in a much more oppressive way, if that were to actually happen?

The amount of "oil underground" will balloon to greater than the volume of Earth, if this goes the way I suspect.

It is still governed by the rules of economics.  If the government starts issuing (printing) tokens in exponentially growing amounts, it'll go the same way as their cash.  If they tie it to a physical asset, like x amount of oil, they won't be able to afford their debts with it, which is why they're getting hyperinflation of their fiat currency in the first place.
My money would be on them hyperinflating it, along with their regular currency.  Having a central issuer makes it no different from a standard fiat currency, from an economic standpoint.

They'd be dead from radiation, even before that.

I say we take it one step further, and get trained vocalists to "sing the song of Bitcoin"  Along with that, trained listeners, and a network of cans and strings, to serve as a backup means of block propagation.  This may be the only way to harden the network against EMP.

Even if the fork diverts value, you can sell your forked coin for the OG coin.  This means the total value you're hodling \(what really matters\) stays the same.  Even if the numbers increase, no money has been stolen from you by the newly printed money, because you get a fair share of that newly printed money, by virtue of it inheriting the same ledger.

The law is unenforceable on any blockchain.  There's no central "owner" of the data to go after.  The only way to memory hole the data, would be to go after every user, both in and out of Europe, and destroy all backups at the same time.
Bitcoin is good for Europe ;\)

Ultimately, people will use the currency that's easiest to use, and holds its value the best.  I don't think most people are interested in sacrificing some of their savings for abstract world economy numbers.  Those could just as easily be cool stuff you bought, money transferred to some faceless bureaucrat, or a bomb dropped on people halfway across the world.
