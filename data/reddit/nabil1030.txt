How does it scale, tho?
**Edit:** To clarify, I meant to get at: How will the fees scale? The fees in this beta testing phase could hardly be representative of what to expect during wider use - unless I'm missing something.
I presume part of the answer is that fees go to the stakeholders of the committed funds...? Do fees also go to the owners of devices that calculate the hop routes?

Pragmatically, I agree with u/AusIV but if you have bank statements or other records of how you sent money to MtGox and BTC-e, you could maybe reconstruct the appropriate purchase amounts. A tax preparer would likely advise underestimating purchase prices.

Rules of thumb I heard:
* Buy a hardware wallet if:
    * you have more than a week's salary in crypto.
    * your crypto holdings are 20x the price of the hardware wallet.
    * you value the piece of mind that a hardware wallet offers over its cost. [This may embolden you to buy more coin.]

I believe it's called "sweeping." Make sure to sweep it into a wallet in your possession. I don't *think* paper wallets can be partially spent. 
Tangentially, if you had BTC in a paper wallet, at the time of the BCH, BTG, or BCD forks (or others in the future), you may wish to keep that paper wallet around after sweeping if you want to access your forked coin.

The hardware wallet (or phone/computer wallet) allows you to communicate with the Bitcoin network. Without that, you're left to use some sort of other software (or write your own) that will turn your key into a meaningful message to the network without revealing your key to prying eyes.
Edit: Distinguish from paper wallet.

**USD deposits via ACH are available for trade immediately.** (Though, a withdrawal hold is placed for that amount withdrawals - either USD or crypto - until the ACH transfer completes.)
**The same is true for smaller crypto deposits.** The threshold isn't clear to me, but when the value of a BTC deposit was less than my daily ACH buy limit, it was available for trade as soon as the transaction was acknowledged by the network. But when I made larger BTC deposits, three confirmations where needed. 
Also, IIRC, there's a **much higher ACH withdrawal limit**. ... Either that or it's a monthly limit - rather than a daily limit.
Like GDAX (not Coinbase), Gemini **pays the cost of outgoing crypto transactions for you**. (*I wonder if they do this to motivate users to keep more funds on the exchanges.*)
*Downside: There are no free trades for limit orders as with GDAX.* Cost is 0.25% and goes down for higher volume. They have different kinds of orders (e.g. Auction, etc.) and IIRC slightly different definitions of "maker" and "taker."

If you're looking to hold BTC off exchange, which is wise, then you'll need an off-exchange wallet. Options potentially good for someone starting out (in order of increasing complexity) include:
* Phone wallet - Easy to start. Be sure to physically write down and securely store your back up seed. See video linked below for suggestions.
* Computer wallet - Harder to set up. Be sure to securely store your backup seed. E.g. Electrum, etc. See video linked below for notes of caution.
* Hardware wallet - Very secure. 
* Paper wallet - Good for hodling, hard to set up securely, need to be careful when spending. E.g. 
See Andreas Antonopoulos's 10 response to a question that speaks to ways to securely store your coin [here](

Strange. My withdrawal on GDAX was $10,000/day - USD or crypto. I just double-checked Gemini and it's $100,000/day.

If you can get verified by Bitstamp (long delay). And for US users, CEX.io isn't available in all states.

If you want to know about what Coinbase might share with the IRS, check out their terms of service you agreed to and relevant reports in the media. Also relevant is the blockchain tracking software that the IRS was/is using to analyze BTC movement. (I forget the name.)
I believe that, from the perspective of the IRS, it is the responsibility of the US citizen to track and report gains and losses of financial holdings on tax returns.
 is downright essential for doing that if you're not a trained accountant.

Respectfully, that's a fiat-centric (USD, GBP, EUR, etc.) orientation. There's an orientation that sees cryptocurrency as something that may largely replace fiat currency - at least in terms of who large amounts of money will be sent or stored around the world. From that perspective, one may reply, "What's your exit strategy from fiat?"

In addition to that, as Andreas said in the video I linked above, "not your keys*, not your coin." I'm not saying that Coinbase is ill-intentioned or will get hacked. Yet there have been corrupt and hacked exchanges in the past (e.g. Mt.GOX, etc.), and we cannot predict whether it would happen again. 
I can understand that newcomers may consider this unnecessarily fearful. You may have not been around when Mt.GOX went down and this sub had pinned posts reminding people to seek emotional help rather than taking their lives over the losses they had.
*Meaning you don't have direct control of what happens to he coin without the action of the exchange as an intermediary.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:07:53
Indeed. CC on Coinbase is only useful if I want more crypto than Gemini let's me deposit in day or if I want to move it sooner than the ACH delay.

So a store of value that pays dividends?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:08:07
Well the wallet into which the paper wallet is swept doesn't* broadcast the private key to the network - just information that cannot be generated without knowing your key.
So I believe paper wallets could be refilled and reused after being emptied. (I'm speaking technically without thinking or commenting on whether that would be wise.)
*If it's a trustworthy wallet. Where trustworthy could be determined by knowing that it is a widely respected product with reviews about it being reliable. Open source is a bonus, but not necessarily sufficient.
Edit: Fixed words and added nuance.

Downloading the blockchain is only needed if you want to run Bitcoin Core and run a network node as well.
It sounds like you're talking about setting up a computer wallet. Electrum or the like would be the way to go.

Verification isn't currently an option for new accounts.

Buy another one (or use any other hardware/phone/computer wallet*). As Andreas gets at in the video linked above, the 12/24-word backup seed *is* the "key" that gives you access to the coin - no matter what HD** wallet you use.
*Any other HD wallet that supports [BIP39 mnemonics HD](
** Hierarchically deterministic
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:35:18
Agreed. For that, though, there's Binance. 
* Lots of trading pairs, including
* UI not great, but mobile UI is.
* Every withdrawal requires 2FA (if enabled?)
* Exchange fees are decent among the competition (0.5% IIRC)
* 2 BTC equivalent daily withdrawal limit until verified
* For some currencies/tokens, exchange orders can only be places for integer values. For others, the number of decimal places is limited. *Maybe that's how they get more profit - Office Space style ;-).*
Both Pro &amp; Con:
* There are flat withdrawal fees for each currency/token. This is great for large withdrawals but annoying for smaller test withdrawals. (*You can check them on the deposit/withdrawal page by putting in a value to send regardless of whether you have funds in there at the moment.*)

Paywalls often only show up if I've viewed several pages of the site recently.
I just open these links in an incognito window in Chrome. This often by-passes cookies that have been counting how many pages I've viewed on the site.

Does Electrum create new keys deterministically? In other words, will a back up through Electrum safely restore all the change addresses from future transactions?
