Nope, it would be a bitmas miracle.

Perhaps their negativity is a result of them starting to panic as the price drops.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:09

Yes he will, for regular purchases once everyone uses bitcoin. Not a minute sooner. 
P.S. HODL for life!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:57
fine for me but looks like they just added bcash

I think you meant Murphy’s law.

Where did coinbase announce it, I saw nothing about it until the chart froze and bch was there after refresh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:20:39
Because it’s bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:16:02
The thought crossed my mind at 10k and I dismissed it as paranoia now it seems more an more likely 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:46:17
A better approach than just coinbase is to transfer to coinbases Gdax interface, fees are better or even free. Look for some videos about how to use gdax and coinbas.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:20:19
This seems like a slang compound word to me more than a new word. But nice work.

I keep putting my money under my pillow at nite but the bit-fairy won’t take it 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:12
Gdax is coinbase it is the coinbase trading platform, it has lower fees than regular coinbase but is the same company 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:41:57
Not all transactions have that high fees some no fees, sure the scammers will scam those who make it easy for them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:46
dont be sad it will go back up
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:56:39
Not positive but I live in the US and often use pia vpn and it in no way effects my gdax accessibility, I believe gdax use your personal info to determine location not ip address, however if it’s an isp issue that prevents you from reaching gdax than the vpn should work.

 wouldn't it be ideal to place the limit orders between these whole number walls, so there is less competition to buy or sell at your limit price.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:17:46
I was in the same boat, for an instant buy the only simple solution I found was buy on the way up and transfer to gdax, the coinbase fee sucks but it’s a one time thing if u do rest on gdax, and the way it’s been rising you will make the fee back in a day or so.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:21
That does sound bass ackwards
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:19
If you belive bitcoin will be &gt;17000 in the future then buy at 17, if not then dont buy at 17000.

They banned alcohol n price for booze went up why would bitcoin be different considering like when booze was illegal it was still legal in much of the world, just as bitcoin would still be legal outside us.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:27:49
Nice, i almost added a sentence along the lines of "unless I am ignorant and you are referring to something else in which case enlighten me" but i thought that sounded a little to douche like, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:13
i see where it is in gdax now, didnt even know they had a message feature, and no twitter for me so i was cought way off guard. At least i know where the messages are now in gdax.

I believe in bitcoin mainly because I believe in the blockchain technology. Blockchains ability to provide a trusted decentralized ledger makes it a solution to not only a solution for monetary transaction records but almost any sort of record keeping. The decentralized nature of bitcoin allows it to function identically for everyone regardless of location, ethnicity, or socio-economic status, in my opinion it’s not so much that bitcoin takes control from the powerful and gives it to the oppressed, the beauty is that bitcoin is the same for everyone everywhere and is a first step towards a more united humanity.
