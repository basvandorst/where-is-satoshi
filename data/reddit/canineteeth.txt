Huh, guess I was misremembering the number of nines. Thanks!

What I believe he is pointing out is that 99.9% is actually not great in the IT world, and a huge underestimation. "Three nines", as in, 99.9, is relatively unreliable. Seven nines is more standard.

Thanks, thankfully I doubt I'll be around by that time.

And from a random google search in which I only looked at the summary, I think the domain name was for "Magic the gathering online exchange."

What everyone else said is true though. It may have been that, but now its used as the main exchange for BTC to USD, which is why its so important in BTCland.

It'd be a bug and I'm starting to suspect theres a lot of robots trading now, value can be a lot more volatile as they'll exacerbate sudden changes.

I'm confused once more. The wiki said it'd take a century to mine out all those bitcoins, though my mind is whispering 2016. Though 2016 might have been just the 50 BTC blocks. 
I posted that thinking of a century forward.

*High Five*, I bought a deck of Magic 2012!

Deepbit is mostly unpopular because of the high fees (fair enough for their great record with uptime) and high power, which also lends to their low variability. It just means that the community has to start putting trust into one entity, which is against what bitcoin is.

I did look in the FAQ but I guess I missed that. Thanks.

Though it does keep transaction fees to itself.

For BTC mining, its better if the memory is underclocked. Helps keep it cool, and its not necessary for BTC mining.

Just getting back into it, the lingo for the community is pretty confusing but as a game I think its great.
