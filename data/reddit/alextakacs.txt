Yes of course, as with any traditional bank (which they are foremost). To be honest their bitcoin support is a bit of a marketing trick. But it's a start...

Not at the moment although they hint that they will add this feature.

Well it is a full blown private bank (ie typically for people investing). They offer the full range of banking services, their USP being online only (no brick and mortar presence) and low cost. They are present on the market for 20+ year and are well regarded. Their bitcoin offering is relatively basic at the moment: you can convert fiat to btc and back (via bitstamp but the process is transparent). I don't think (have to 2x check) that you can transfer in or out. No special service, margin trading, etc.

In one word: yes.

I muss say I am genuinely impressed with what they pulled off.

Interpol was not created to do the bidding of the US government (although some may disagree).
This is just a recognition that there is only one super power in the world we live in. If the US has decided that they want you they will exert the appropriate pressure on the government having jurisdiction... See the Kim Dotcom saga for instance, it is a perfect example. And if for some reason the judicial process fails (or the place you are would not bend their rules) they will either pick you up (that's called extraordinary rendition) or blast you with a hellfire, collateral damage be damned. That's how things work so better be ready.

Actually I remember an incident in Switzerland where Mossad operatives managed to botch a surveillance job and actually got detained for - gasp - a few days...

Russia is member of Interpol and there is a decent amount of cooperation here. Obviously, as most countries, Russia does not extradite it's citizens.

Regarding your last assertion my understanding is that France was very helpful too. De Gaulle definitely helped Israel get the bomb.
But this is quite a thread drift...

Ok just gone through the indictment... Unless am I missing something the amounts being mentioned are "pocket money". Not saying there isn't more to the story but contrast this with what HSBC was doing with Mexican drug cartel money and how they came through without any criminal charge.

Well had about 1k$ worth, not too bad. Very careful to minimize my exchange deposits... Why? Because I've been burned with... mtGox !!! How ironic

With his supposed wealth I'm surprised he did not have something in place to warn him he was a person of interrest.

Point taken 
Just mentioning that sometimes they don't slip through....
