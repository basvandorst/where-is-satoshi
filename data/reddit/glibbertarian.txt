So maybe people should stop using these kinds of exchanges.  If government is the answer, it was a stupid question.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:54:35
I remember the white paper describing it as "peer to peer". I don't think a centralized exchange is a "peer" unless words stop meaning things.

Im hoping it does too but its definitely slow and by no means assured.  Either way these centralized exchanges take more value than they add, especially for those whose funds were taken.

Im not sure you correctly read what you quoted.  The end, and also the best means of achieving that end, is a state where each individual has:


That state of freedom is the END each person should want to achieve/enjoy.  Everyone practicing/obeying this freedom is also the MEANS by which it is achieved.  You're befuddling yourself.

Freedom, "the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint" provided they aren't directly injuring someone else is a "good" thing, intrinsically and otherwise, from both a utilitarian and moral point of view.
Freedom is a means and an end.
There is nowhere in the world today where there is an over-abundance of this freedom, it is the opposite, unfortunately, and, yes, one should "lean" towards more freedom, rather than away, even if you think 100% pure freedom would be problematic, because there are too many people being oppressed today.

1. They haven't actually added that.  
2. I wasn't wrong; they changed the game to add that.  I didn't say you never would be able to.  If I say "its not raining" when it's nice out, and then later it starts raining, I wasn't wrong.
3. It isn't clear that even if we get bases that they will be on the "surface" as my comment is regarding.

Use only one where you keep full control of your private keys and this can't happen to you...Bitsquare 
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:40:43
An exchange may or may not have a trade engine.  Localbitcoins is a local exchange.  Bitsquare is an online exchange.  Words really aren't that hard.
An alpha is essentially used for testing purposes and not supposed to be for widespread use.  In any case I used the word "relative".
Robust reputation systems will help mitigate sybil attacks and that will come with time.  That is probably why there are very modest trading limits right now.
So you're implicating all online crypto exchanges and saying we're all stupid for using them, then?  I DON'T use them.  DID you?

I say we end this exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:32:31
Lol did you just gloss over the other meaning, right there underneath: 
"absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual".  Sounds a lot like "without rulers" to me.  It is the word's origin and one of it's meanings.
Either way, people like you just lack imagination and can only conceive of the way things currently are.  History will show technology enabling more and more individual freedom and less and less hierarchical control.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:52:23
Right, so youre saying if you have an address you are a "peer" even if you are an entity controlling 10000 addresses.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:20:36
That's an expansive definition of "peer" that renders the term essentially meaningless imo.

Ah then the banking system is also "peer to peer" and the words don't real mean anything.
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:39:52
@_date: 2016-08-24 01:19:38


Yes, it really is, by definition.  You seem overly worried about corporations for some reason.  Tell me how a corporation becomes so powerful in a world with no government regulation of the market (which would also be free of cronyism and protectionism, mind you) that you think it's better to take away individual rights?  Some rights you're presumably taking away are: the right to work for any rate, the right to work any number of hours you like, the right to work under any conditions you like, the right to work without a given certification, etc...
Also can you point to an unregulated, free market that displays some of these (I assume) undesirable qualities that justify taking away of rights?
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:33:55
"Wrong kind" of freedom is not freedom in the first place - it's something else.
Some freedom is definitely necessary as you say.  Complete freedom would be even better.  I don't know how fewer choices can ever be better than more.
Maybe we could use the concept of honesty as a parallel.  You would probably say the same things about honesty in regards to amount and kind.  I on the other hand, would actually prefer people were completely honest.  Yes, some people would be offended sometimes and in general people would have to develop thicker skins, so to speak, but on the whole, humankind would be better off.
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:29:55

If you don't believe freedom is intrinsically good then were really not going to agree on much.
It's like saying free thought is a bad thing because some people may think bad thoughts and tell you about them.
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:08:51
So your argument is that freedom precludes all those things?
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:49:08
Plus I heard "Satoshi's Nakamoto" means "a baby's erection" in Navajo
@_date: 2016-08-27 17:51:35
We're just not going to agree about the definition of "injustice" and/or "fairness".  Im a voluntaryist so, to me, any agreement entered into mutually is fair and any one coerced is not.  Also, the universe doesnt owe you the existence of perfect options.

There is no favoring one way or the other; everything is voluntary in a truly free-market (the economic side of Libertarianism).
"Libertarian" is an umbrella term that can cover a wide range of thought, all the way to Anarcho-Capitalism, but generally it means more individual freedom and liberty.  You no longer lean towards more individual freedom?  That's unfortunate.

Dude, it's an exchange.  What are you doing?  Exchanging one currency for another.  You've created some arbitrary definition requiring an "engine" to try to be right when the plain meaning of the words defeat you.
I have nothing to do with Bitsquare and I'm not pimping anything, whatever that means. I don't even use it.  I hodl my coins and occasionally buy something through Purse.io or Steam.  Uh oh - am I pimping them now?!?
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:58:12
We could go all the way into absurdism and talk about heads having freedom from bodies and talk about how that would be bad, too.  Were not talking about freedom at the microscopic level, or at least shouldn't be, if we're debating how society should organize itself.  You're describing two situations where the players (or writers) have already freely opt-ed in to a given rule set.
Is the contrived construct of mandatory non-violence you're talking about the existing law we already have or obeyance to the principle of freedom?
Better weapons, sure.  Doesn't matter.  I've defined freedom to include not directly injuring others.  Freedom from and freedom to.
Yes, I realize the current status quo on Earth is nation-states.  I also understand that the current state was not arrived at by everyone following the principles of freedom, and that's partly why it's so wrong.  Most people don't think nearly as hard about these topics as we do, unfortunately, so I suspect that we won't see a true minarchy, let alone Ancapistan, until we are colonizing space, but then again, technology can surprise you.  Just look at Bitcoin's emergence.
Freedom is like perfection, it's not necessarily something that is ever fully achieved but rather a goal to strive toward.

I posted about this recently.  I asked if we're hodling our way to lower merchant adoption since many of us just want to hold it and not spend it.  I only have ever spent mine at Purse bc of the large savings.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:03:42
It could be 9999 EH and it wouldn't help scaling one bit.  It helps immutability, not scaling.

Rather than arguing over the definition of the word "anarchy", since we both have reasonable enough understanding of what it means, let's go back to my original statement you quoted:


I said "lean towards".  All things being equal, should we (humankind as it currently exists) move towards individual freedom or away from it?   Your comment suggests you'd like to, on the whole, move away from it.  
Perhaps you would be OK with a Minarchy where there is only a minimal State providing military, courts, and police?  What would your objection be to that?  Too much individual freedom?  Not enough?  Please explain.

I didn't think it was a *human* saddle.  I know what saddle look like but you say a saddle in 3D. So is that from the side, the top, isometric?   Are we just talking about a "U" shape?
@_date: 2016-04-18 03:16:33
I'm all for valid honest criticism.  Are your multiple references to bitcoins as "drug tokens" one of your factual claims?  What percentage of bitcoin transactions would have to be in service of taking drugs to make this factual?  Also, I'm sure you have some valid criticisms of bitcoin - most critical thinkers would - but we would also have reasons for optimism.  You  just like to stir the pot and crap on people's optimism.  Maybe you enjoy that, I dont know.

I disagree but that's not the point really.  I think there's a general consensus that Bitcoin needs continued adoption, which means merchant user and adoption.  But the more we hodl and the less we transact the smaller the market looks to potential new Bitcoin merchants.  IDK maybe I'm over thinking it.

Even better is when you can actually get 4% interest on your deflationary currency.  I've been doing this with BSave.io and it seems a little too good to be true so it probably is.  Probably won't last much longer and/or I'll lose them all!

And the thing that most consumers care most about is price.  Obviously the OB volume is tiny right now and there are a lot of problems but, at least in theory, one can see a future where the consumer saves money AND the merchant does as well using a P2P fee-less system.

Like I said, only a massive price decrease would make me want to change, which is what would happen if a coin "dies".  And then, the only change I'd be interested in would be to increase the amount of on-chain scaling ie: blocksize.

Right so those Coinbase holders youre describing dont count towards the number of transactions happening on the network and, yet, even when not counting these users, SW adoption is stuck around 10%.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:15
If you're implying that's what's happening on eth, why aren't the much, much smaller coins which are even more centralized doing just that?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:44:56
Where did I say SW shouldn't be adopted?  Why is it a binary choice?  You can *gasp* do both! I was for 2X bc I don't care how it was born, just that it happened.  Having a bigger block doesn't stop LN, Schnorr sig's, MAST, Mimblewimble, or any other improvement.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:56
That's the opinion of the devs working on it.  Go watch Breaking Bitcoin conference.  And, yes, we do have a proven scaling method thats always worked until an arbitrary limit was hit...  We could've used *all* scaling options but instead we're hamstrung with the most proven method being off limits bc muh raspberry pi node.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:03:18
Not really.  For one, there's other coins you can mine with those same ASICs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:35:34
They are collapsing relative to Bitcoin already.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:23:25
Maybe 50% of the people, definitely not 50% of the coins don't "know" it, unless you count a dead Satoshi not "knowing".
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:42:47
Once this is ready and everyone using, why wouldn't people just open a channel with all their coins?  If the security is just as good as regular txs, why not do that?  What is the downside?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:53:48
Kinda sounds like you want someone to give you some coin.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:05:56
Was a 1mb limit forever a guarantee?
Nope, I'm not arguing for "free" txs, I'm arguing for allowing blocks to grow up to 2 or maybe even 4mb as needed (they may not fill up right away), while layer 2 tech and SW reach fruition.
And yes, I have btc all over the place, in many wallets, with unspent utxos and will need to do several very large txs to get out.  
I can also no longer suggest clients pay me in btc and have a worry free experience; Paypal is better again, even with their fees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:05:53
So, wait, LN won't be widely adopted?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:07:40
I agree, that's why I was always OK with a simple doubling of the blocksize which requires nothing new of users or wallets/exchanges/merchants and wouldn't have precluded also doing SW and would have negligible effect on decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:12:42
It wouldn't really matter bc at some point you're coming back to fiat through an exchange...Unless you go 100% crypto and use only to purchase things that aren't USD.  That's the end game.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:48:25
Of course they would be full again at some point, but the fees would be cheaper on the way there.  How much higher would fees be if the blocksize were cut in half?  That's about how much discount were missing out on now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:55:00
Couldn't just one large exchange offer it to their customers and then that entire cohort would benefit?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:29:42
Title 0 would be best.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:52:15
Is there no other scaling solution besides LN that BCH could use?  Even on chain?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:47:41
Wrong, actually high fees are stopping me from using it or exiting from it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:57:28
Shouldn't reducing fees by half be enough of an incentive?  Did most users simply not know enough about it?  Should we not expect many new Bitcoin improvements to have similar adoption issues?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:41:52
Right but if everyones using it you'd be able to send money anywhere cheaply and it's just as secure as normal txs so why does it matter if your coins are "locked up" if every address is available in LN.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:36:34

@_date: 2017-12-27 02:09:19

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:41:58
Cuz it works.  What would you have them do?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:50:49


They are going to sell side-chains; they're not hiding it.
Also if LN requires a block size increase (it doesn't, strictly speaking) then why not do it now?!?!?  Also, go look up the Breaking Bitcoin conference and watch the devs talk about how far away LN is from readiness.  You probably think it's coming in 2018 don't you?  You'd be wrong though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:57

@_date: 2017-12-25 16:24:11
This is exactly how it will work initially.  The hope is that enough txs that are currently on-chain will be moved to the cheaper second layer, alleviating on-chain fees, like you'll need to pay to open and close channels.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:35:37
If I was a miner I wouldn't want any changes at all.  Why would I; I'd be raking it in hard and any change brings only uncertainty.  Only a massive price decrease would make me think about a change.  Incentives are everything.

Reducing fees by half is certainly enough for the average user to seek out a wallet or exchange that made use of it...  Why didn't they?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:27:36
I've watched all those people and they say nothing that counters what he said.  That is exactly how the LN will start: 2 parties create a channel by each locking coins up which uses an on-chain tx.  Eventually enough big players do this and you can start routing through these connections to your end point, paying tiny fees per hop.  We get it.  We need a critical mass of exchanges to implement it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:39:17
Wouldn't that be a "sell" wall?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:11:38
They don't need SW per se, they need a transaction malleability fix - no idea where they are with that.
Aren't there other on-chain scaling improvements like using Schnorr signatures also available?

Sure, but they could save much more by regularly using Segwit than they can making a few satoshis being a LN hub, and yet its not being adopted quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:53:43
So sometime after they do Segwit in 2018 (if they stay on schedule).

Right but that's true for all currencies, if and when that should happen.
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:58:21
You don't think the fees will go back down as block space opens up?  They don't know what will happen to total fees if more block space is added but they certainly like how much they're making right now, and they don't even need to do any extra development like they must to prepare for Segwit.  If it were me,  I'd just keep raking it in...Doesn't seem to be hurting the price.

I don't know many businesses forward thinking enough to take a short-term loss, especially when everyone seems to agree that LN will bring a race to the bottom on fees, but perhaps blocks will still be full.  Who knows?  We're it me I would do what they're doing and use every excuse to keep good thing going. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:54:35
This is what I've been saying....Stupid to think miners would just accept Segwit willingly when it bypasses them and at best allows for linear amount of new txs (which will probably have much less fee income).

@_date: 2017-03-20 17:58:37
Like I said to the others, I'm pretty sure they just want to delay Segwit as long as they can without really destroying the price and their livelihood.  My guess is we will see them capitulate to Segwit under some condition that delays it from happening for a long period.  Then they can get higher prices from an accord being worked out and still get full block / high fees until it's implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:23:39
At the very least he can delay Segwit as long as possible.  Obviously all the users want innovation bc it costs them nothing.  Miners, not when it costs them.

I think all the other business owners get it, its just in their interest to not recognize that Jihan is doing it for purely rational reasons.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:52:21
Maybe he feels starting down the off-chain path would lead to linear on-chain but exponential off-chain growth.  He's playing this the right way though.  Would've been stupid for them to just accept Segwit and get no concessions.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:36:02

Thank you, yes.  I expect we will see him reluctantly agree to Segwit under the condition that there be a waiting period so he can keep raking in record fees for a while (fees that will probably be even higher once he signals SW and the price goes back up because of the miner harmony).
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:07:47
Merchants pay Visa fees directly, consumers pay them indirectly.  Same with PayPal.  That drew me to BTC along with the rebuking of The State.  I bet for most people it's a combination of use cases / reasons that bring them in.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:11:40
That's true but I still don't see any incentive for them to change behavior while the price of BTC keeps rising.  Especially when no one knows what SW will do to fees.  These people aren't stupid or even near-sighted.  Why not just keep raking in record fees?  "We don't know what future upgrades will bring but we know we are doing great right now..."
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:43:35
Thank you good sir.  I think it's a Limerick, or close, at least.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:55:42


Then why are we in this position?  Maybe concession isn't strictly the best word when what they want is ultimately to delay Segwit as long as possible without forking.  I don't think they want a fork, it's just used a threat to delay.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:51:58
Personally I think there is going to be plenty of room for several different cryptos as the whole space grows and they all gain against unlimited fiat but that the days of 85% BTC dominance are over... but I'd love to wrong.

Now all anyone needs to do is make them a written guarantee that their profits will not go down with the development of off-chain scaling and we are good.
In reality one of two things will happen: price will crash and they will decide they are hurting price too hard, or an agreement will be reached that includes a nice long delay of SW so they can keep raking it in.

Bitcoin got this far with 10 minute block times and all accounts say usership is growing as is.  Again, there's no guarantee of exponential user adoption with SW/LN, though there certainly is the guarantee of less need for on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:39:30

Please explain to *me* how a technology that allows cheap off-chain txs to grow exponentially won't grow faster than the use cases/users that would be brought in for on-chain?
Basically this is the calculation you have to make, also considering an expectation of the price in both situations, which would admittedly probably be higher with SW and less FUD from miners.

My Comcast bill is $130/mo including HBO and 200mbps internet.  The TV part is about $50 of that.  
You're moving the goal posts by including a lot more than just "TV".
I agree it's a waste, though, and I've even had the same 50" 1080p TV for like 8 years.  My wife makes me keep cable, that's the only reason.

I'm for Segwit and slower scaling but the reason I stay with btc is to make money.  I'm excited about it's ability to disrupt the State, but I wouldn't stay with a money loser.
Ver genuinely believes that mass adoption is being held back by an artificial block size, one that Satoshi even said could easily be changed one day.  He is doing something to back up his views, and in so doing he is making his ~300k coins all worth less.  To say he's doing this for the money is absurd and requires belief in an altcoin conspiracy theory that no one has any proof of.  Even if he has been paying a PR company, that is what major players do nowadays.  Successful PR companies employ social engineering strategies and there's nothing wrong with it.  You have a choice to believe everything you read or not.

If adoption skyrockets, the fees will be that much higher as people compete for blockspace *and* the price would undoubtedly rise with any skyrocketing of adoption and then the fees are higher all over again.  It's all a balancing act.

Or maybe it turns them off completely from wanting to do anything beyond the minimum they are forced to do; Laws always have unintended consequences.  It's best to just do what is ethically correct from the beginning rather than predicting that the ends will justify the means.

Everything you said there is true and I also would've liked a tidier, quicker HF to 2mb or more, but when you fail to present any of the benefits of small blocks and/or potential downsides of larger blocks you aren't presenting the whole argument.

Maybe this will help you: 


What's funny about your argument is you probably think this is a slight but I'm actually proud of not being normal in my views, especially in this case. Your argument is the functional equivalent of "dont think for yourself" or "just do what everybody else is doing".  


Is THIS what an argument should look like?  Just saying things like "make no sense", "nonsense arguments", "kooks", "embarrassment to themselves".

I always remember that technology increases exponentially while human sustenance remains flat (ie: 2000 calories/day, 64oz clean water, protection from elements, basic medicine) so it will become increasingly easier to eliminate poverty and the crime associated with that.  
But what we consider standard now might be inadequate in the future (how do you live without XYZ genetic upgrade??? You don't have cryonic services??!?!?!) so maybe it's a moving goalpost situation.
I just hope in the future we have completely autonomous, sovereign individuals  interacting voluntarily.  Of course, we may all just end up lying in a bacterial vat connected to a neural lace.

No, actually, the logical conclusion is not that there would no longer be roads, planes, hospitals, or police - it's that they would be PRIVATIZED and compete for your business.  There's no "dancing" around anything - the arguments are met head on and answered.

Yea I've come to the conclusion that the ultimate adoption of crypto will give us low fees and possibly confidentiality but the deflationary thing ain't gonna last long term.  There won't be "one" coin, they're just too easy to create and interchange.

Not necessarily.  People that want to live in that or any arrangements they choose can do so on their land with their own property/resources, pooled or otherwise.  
The concept of countries is being made more and more useless.  If you want to live in a small private country as Communists or Socialists or what have you, do so; simply don't force others to be a part of your system.  People should be able to choose their governance same as they choose everything else in their life...Like they're starting to with...(you fill this in, considering our sub).

There is no social contract.

Again, he didn't agree to this, didn't sign anything, and you should research the concept of the [Tyranny of the Majority](


Slavery exists in different degrees and I'm not trivializing anything, in fact, I'm calling attention to it in this case while you are defending it.

@_date: 2017-01-06 20:25:31
I largely agree with you.  What people like myself don't agree with is the threat/use of violence by the State to enforce their preferred version of help/charity.

I agree with pretty much all of that but it's still a negative blanket statement that I know is wrong from my own experience in several different teaching capacities (public school, personal training, raising kids, etc...).
If you frame all conversation as argument in the context of Reddit then yes you'll do better by flattering people and letting them think they found the idea on their own.   This is "How to Win Friends and Influence People" 101.
But to say no one ever has thanked anyone for teaching them is wrong.
Also, in all the listening you are doing, there
 is someone doing the saying.

I wouldn't underestimate the power of a decentralized, fully armed militia and/or private defense and dispute resolution organizations; they have won many times before.

Again, you said: 


So you can't defend what you said, even by proxy?  Honestly, I'm really done arguing with you as your whole argument comes down to "It's not popular".  Is this really how you live your life?  Do you just put your finger in the air and go with the crowd? I'm not going to respond to your other comment either.  I get it now.  It's as I suspected: you work(ed) for the federal government.  You probably got a lot of benefits and pension for doing very little (and that inefficiently) and it all came out of the taxpayers pockets.  What a nice gig.  I have nothing else to say unless you actually want to rebut any points on the anarchy platform.

Yes but once it's been fully deployed you won't have to do this very often bc once you've chosen how much coin you want to "lock in" to LN you can leave that channel open as long as you want.  Maybe you just want to lock up what you expect to spend in a month, and then close the channel at month's end for example.  You would've paid 1 (or 2?) on-chain fees and however many very small LN fees depending on your number of purchases and how many hops they took.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:44:21
"Trolls" are actually a lot like the "spamming the mempool" situation.  It's a cheap attack vector, but in either case Bitcoin (or r/Bitcoin) has to be able to deal with it or it won't matter long term.

They're all "regular transactions" on the main chain with big blocks and no SW/LN.

Even if that's true gold and silver have different industrial use cases that are not interchangeable; BTC and LTC have pretty much the same overall purpose: paying for stuff electronically.  The only thing that gold/silver have in common with btc/ltc is that they're used as currency, have reliable issuance rates, and similar relative market caps (I'm just guessing on this one).

Actually ostracism is another strong deterrent since humans are social creatures but, yes, the eventual threat of violence will probably need to exist.

I guess we'll see which one really ends up having lower fees once LNs are up and well adopted.  If it ends up being less on the bigger block chain it's probably only bc you're denominating in USD rather than sat/byte and the underlying btc is worth more.

I hope so but I don't see how this helps Bitcoin very much on net considering a ton of merchants that we're only accepting Bitcoin will now be accepting basically every coin eventually so to me this is the beginning of a huge degrading of network effect as merchant adoption dominance was usually one of the first reasons given for Bitcoin dominating.

I doubt it; people know what ACH is even though they don't need to.  I guess it depends on how much is on- vs off-chain but I still think there will at least be a general understanding that bitcoin is the thing that makes it possible even if they don't know what PoW, hashing, etc...
Also, if they are holding any of the currency the B symbol will still be used.

You're trying to solve a problem that won't be there.  If mainstream consumer adoption happens it will have been, at least in part, bc the wallet/exchange software experience already became much better. 
Also, if you don't have the private key, they're not your coins, so let's not encourage business models where that's the case.

If you want to loan someone coins with interest, you can do that with a smart or standard contract or third party multisig.  If they don't repay you there is still a legal system.  I don't see how it's that different than fiat in this sense.  One thing we do need, though, is recurring payments ie memberships and subscriptions.

Bad advice.  Nicehash is for mining alts but you're paid out biweekly in btc *anonymously* and it automatically mines whatever coin is most profitable for your card(s) at any given moment.  It's actually a nice little service.

To me that means the recent short term (24 hours) and ETH is up relative to BTC 1.22% on Polo.  If people are going from ETH into BTC pre-fork as he suggests, how would ETH be UP relative to BTC in the day prior to the fork?

When was you running whatever node you wanted ever at issue?  No one was ever or could ever take that away, you could make your own if you wanted.  What matters is the overall consensus and value of that network (otherwise what's the point of running the software at all?).  Looks like a large chunk of people have gone and taken their value with them.  The only input you have to add on this is "Oh well, see you later".  That's fine, but don't pretend like it doesn't hurt your network's worth at all bc you can still run your node.

@_date: 2017-11-14 03:02:08
That's a useless statement; they've also been "repeatedly" accepted and Bitcoin's have also been "repeatedly" rejected and accepted.  You can say anything you want when there are no parameters.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:09:04
Actually Bitcoin was the thing that needed to change and it didn't; not in the right way, and not fast enough.  We could've had 2mb blocks years ago and all this forking wouldn't have needed to happen.  Fixing transaction malleability and a doubling of the block size would've been just fine.  Increasing block size is so far the only proven method we have for scaling and doubling to 2mb or even 4mb wouldn't have changed the decentralized nature of the protocol or node ecosystem and layer2 could've still been being developed all the while.
Instead now we have scaling via forked altcoin.

I didn't bring up ETH specifically, but while we're on the subject, ETH mining is certainly more decentralized than BTCs.  But, yes, having a figurehead in Vitalik that many people look to makes it too centralized for my tastes.

Bitcoin spend transactions consume various amounts of inputs (coins that address previously received).  The fewer inputs the smaller the tx size and smaller the fee.

I don't know what that means.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:53:37

Right now: "For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 81,360 satoshis. ($5.36)...and it would only take you 75 blocks to confirm!
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:15:21
I get that, but the word "bailout" has a certain connotation (ie: banks) in a space like this (money).  Nobody is being given or forgiven funds like the banks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:16:30
So arguing for a blocksize increase protocol change, as Satoshi even suggested, is imposing rules on people?  Wow!  I guess Satoshi was the biggest tyrant of all - he created the whole thing!
Oh, wait.  We're talking about peer-to-peer crypto currency protocols that everyone is free to follow, fork, or GTFO.

Because using Segwit is complicated for non-technical types; it doesn't "just work" and on top of that none of the major exchanges support it (or few, I haven't kept up on that).  I was waiting for Electrum to support it, and then I got 3.0 and....what now?  Am I using it now?  Do I have to make a new wallet?  How do I know if I'm using it?  It's not a great UX.

You think he's the one selling BCH but not BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:36:09
There is less liquidity than btc, how much I don't know, but that should normalize eventually.  When the exchanges release the coins they will also add the ability to sell/and buy them so that downward selling pressure should be offset to some degree by large new exchanges like Coinbase adding it.  Probably a big hit to bch in the short term but positive in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:50:25

LOL how do you think the US and most other countries were created?


Good for you.  Not everyone wants every service.  Some people use disproportionately more than others.  It is not morally correct to force people into such a system.


LOL, ok.  Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.  Again, popular vote doesn't make something right.  Look at civil rights, for one.


Wrong.  The private sector drives costs down for many reasons, not least of all is because people are directly paying their own money for their purchases.


Then give me an example of one that exists without govt help.


Define "fair".  Not that I'm for such a system in the first place, but are you familiar with how percentages work?  Why wouldn't say, 10% of your monthly revenue be fair?  You could argue a flat fee is "unfair", whatever that means, but why do people like you need your percentages to also be "progressive"?


Are you property?  Do you own yourself?  Your children?  If not, who does?  If so, why are you able to "own" yourself without consent of The State, but not other physical property?


This is the Appeal to Popularity fallacy and has zero sway on what is moral.
If you think nation-states are so great that's fine, you can elect to be governed by one and play by all the rules and have all the public services everyone in that group wants.  If you don't want to be, you should be allowed to secede on your own property (call it a nation-state of one person if you love the concept so much).  Or maybe a group of land owners want to form their own country or co-op with their own rules, why should a State stop them?
Ancaps believe that as long as were making rules and ideals about what should be, all interactions should be voluntary.  So, that means people must affirmatively consent to their governance.  It's pretty simple really.

Yes, people say they want more "free" things.  They also say they want less tax burden.  Politicians make promises with other people's money to get elected and the fact that it's not paid for fully doesn't matter to them so we have the situation we have now with tremendous debt and unfunded obligations.  You're old - you'll get all your promised SS money- I probably won't.  How do you feel about that.  What's *your* solution to that?  Do you believe in generational theft?  Why or why not?  The baby boomer generation is getting paid out 3 to 1 vs what they paid in.  The can is kicked down the road.  My 3 kids come into the world with a combined ~$160k debt hanging over them because politicians promise things.
So, yea, I want to decentralize everything possible and stop living as tax-cattle.  Bitcoin is an archetype example.  Energy will soon be decentralized as well; you don't need a central power plant when you can have a personal nuclear reactor and/or solar/wind installation on your dwelling.  Drones will get more and more powerful so you really wont need roads at some point.  And on and on.  The future is not left vs right, it is land vs cloud, but you're just too set in your old ways to see it so you cling to the old ways.

Actually anybody can declare it.  International law will decide who is given title.

There are some rules governing this and also some precedent to be set, im sure.  This kind of thing doesn't happen all the time.

Well, right now Croatian authorities are blocking access to the land and arresting people, but the courts are throwing out the arrests so it's not exactly conducive to development when no one can be on the land.  They've done as much as they possibly can in the mean time.

It can indeed be very significant for any or many of those countries, no matter what the topline number is.  I would like my country to be one of the ones that ends up benefitting rather than servicing a debt to the detriment of its citizens' quality of life.

Congratulations on having penetrating insight into what already is, and none regarding new possibilities.
And your argument that because the people trying to help this country get started are being given titles is also super helpful and relevant.  Titles are, of course, the feature of big government that Libertarians find so problematic.

ot it.  
It's so funny that you like to talk about "the way shit actually works" because property rights ARE the way things actually work in the world (the successful parts, anyway), so...you're just confused, I guess.  Probably because the concept of property rights actually *decreases* conflict overall.
I guess you would just stand by as someone pissed on you because your body is not yours because you can't own things :/

Actually advancing gay marriage rights advances hetero freedom at the same time.  It gives heteros the ability to marry their same gender as much as it does homos, technically.

Yes I certainly do.  When you improve unowned land, such as clearing and planting crops or building a house on it, it becomes yours.  There were no Native improvements done on the land I own and those responsible for any improvements that did happen are not around to collect payment anyway.
If SpaceX goes and builds a bubble colony on Mars that allows humans to breathe inside, then, yea, they can own that.  The potential of ownership and/or somehow making your life better is a driver of much innovation and accomplishment.
Also, you are able to own your person, so there is precedent.  If you are so far out as to believe you don't own yourself...
I'm not responding to you in 2 places, so to your separate comment: participating in a society does not make humans a hivemind collective which should be self evident insofar as you're having this disagreement with me and such disagreements happen often.  Also, seems like you believe in a deterministic universe where everything from the Big Bang on has been preordained so individual choice is an illusion and no one has any real agency.  That can never be proven either way but it sure seems like a sad, pointless way to view existence.

If you draw a federal pension I guess the joke IS on me and all taxpayers because we have to pay for all you to sit at desks and be lazy slobs for awhile and then retire with pensions.  
You really don't need to say anything else; we know now why you defend the govt. so much: they pay you with our money.  It's really that simple.  Incentives are everything, the rest is just noise.  Luckily the very technology you are here to talk about is one of the tools that will help show the world how outdated these centralized institutions are becoming and will ultimately help "starve the beast" of resources.
Also, I never came out and said "blockchain all the things", but thanks for the strawman.

Yes, actually that is the point.  It's actually not even a transaction if it's off-chain on one of those exchanges.  It's just them changing values in a private database.
You're bringing up LN which exchanges aren't using yet and is unproven as well.

LOL.  You don't think every generation has "worked all their lives"?  Were there past generations that only needed to work half their lives or something?  Those are meaningless words, like when politicians talk about "hard-working families".  Which families are hard-working and which are not?
If anything, the retirement age of upcoming generations will be LATER than the boomers, not to mention that for most of them, 1 income per household was sufficient.  Boomers are enjoying overly generous pensions (private and governmental) that cost way more than intended due to the increase in life-expectancy.
Look into it and you'll find that the baby boomer generation is getting 3X more in benefits than they put, in adjusted for inflation.

Assuming you believe in private property (you contrast western civilization with Native Americans), tell me why you don't believe in the private ownership of land (true ownership).  Why must it be as part of a "country"?  What defines a country, and what makes their claim legitimate?  Can my wife and I be a country?
Do you believe in Intellectual Property?  What makes that property?
Some people want to bake their own private cake and don't want a communal cake, even if you don't like the way theirs looks.  Or maybe they want to break away from the communal societal cake with a small group of other like-minded thinkers and make their own cake *with their own materials*. You should allow for this if you are truly open-minded.  Why should it hurt you if some people want to play by their own rules on their own land?  The only argument I can see is some stupid "ends justify the means" rationalization for taking away what should be peoples' natural rights so others feel less inconvenienced.

Some say it's the biggest.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:12:02
Basically it's a different way of calculating transaction size.  The new block weight corresponds exactly to a 1mb block *size*, so no change there, but what was added is a new type of transaction (segwit) that takes up less block weight.  So the block size never increased, they just added a new type of transaction that allows more transactions of a certain type to fit in blocks.  Right now about 5% of transactions are taking advantage of this.

I'm sorry... when did I opt-in to the set of rules for the country I'm in?
Obviously, you can't opt out of biology but you can opt-out of all related social constructs.  If you do not, and choose to stay, as in a family or couple, than in those cases where the opting-out has only a social cost, staying could reasonably be construed as consent.  Regarding governments, there are significant costs associated with leaving/entering new countries, as well as the bare fact that no country in existence will let you simply secede and become your own country with land you rightfully have paid for.  When seceding is allowed and you (and anyone else who also chooses) can become your own private sovereign, then your argument would make more sense.
I'm kinda tired of only defending my side of things here as it feels like I have held up an ideal to strive toward and you just simply shit on things without offering your own ideas, or should I just assume you are Mr. Status Quo?
@_date: 2016-09-02 00:25:46
Explain to me why I (or a group of people) can't take the land I (we) own and secede from our host country, not use their services, and create our own sovereign.  Why shouldn't this be allowed, other than that it is not convenient for the host country?  You can start with the free-rider problem if you want, but I'd prefer stronger...

Also, something being "inconvenient" for neighbors isn't good enough reason for taking away people's freedom. 
If you don't think I really do own my property, then who does?  And why?  What right do they have to own it in a way that supersedes my ownership?  Is it simply might = right in your view?  Is it because a particular country has a certain type of governance.  Please tell me what is the exact, perfect, governance system for human beings.

Call it whatever word you want but when looking at the big-picture narrative, it's one word that would accurately describe what's happening.  If you want it to happen so bad then you shouldn't care what it's called

Maybe I should say *less* nuanced.  While I'm all for less aggression of all kinds, I think if you want to have a principle that could be reliably applied (such as in courts) it needs to have a physical component, something objectively measurable.

Maybe he shipped them in containers that could easily withstand .2 teaspoons of explosives, I don't really know all the details of how they were shipped or stored.

Yes, actually I can.  What is he lying about?  He simply has a different vision for Bitcoin or now, BCash.  He said he paid a high fee to pay his employees?  Yea, he actually did.


Yea, but where's the harm?  Obviously he hasn't physically stolen or destroyed anyone's coins... so what has he done to cause direct harm or how has he defrauded anyone of their coins?

Don't worry there will soon be an ICO for the new DeceaseCoinDark
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:11:10
Why didn't you answer the question, though?  Basically all of Bitcoins crypto competitors are "decentralized" except maybe Ripple which is really something else.  There are different degrees of decentralization though.
I can think of some improvements now but I'm mostly thinking about long term, like I said.  It's naive to think there won't be improvements made in the space and just hand-waive away that Bitcoin will absorb them all.  We don't even know that Bitcoin's governance model will succeed long term.  I own mostly Bitcoin, but I'm not so myopic to think that in 70 years the peer-to-peer money space will look anything like it does today.  It may, but I think it's more likely that it wont.

lol what resource is being stolen?  You mean exchanges may choose to call the one that they think best qualifies as such Bitcoin?  Also, there's no stealing of the blockchain as the rules of the protocol already in place dictate what happens in these events.
As if any of this had rules anyway.
I'd rather 2X just go away but I'm not one of these people who deny that miners and exchanges have any power.  They have power just like nodes and users do.

We both fail to show the use of force...bc there was none.  Bitcoin is an opt-in protocol.  The fact that merchants exchange goods for it and some places let you exchange it for fiat is irrelevant.  Roger Ver never stole a single bit from anyone and I'm tired of the mudslinging.  I don't like BCash either (except for the extra BTC I got with it) but my arguments against it are strong enough that I don't have to name-call it's proponents.

Who can say what is good for Bitcoin, or do you just mean what will make the price go up?  Or is TPS a metric to use for this, or something else?
I agree about looking objectively, and that's why Im asking here.  I look to the track record *and incentives* of those on both sides.  For example, It's clear that someone like Erik Vorhees/Shapeshift would benefit from a split, but I also think Blockstream benefits from smaller blocks, when you look at their (only?) product Liquid (If this isn't the case I'd like to hear why not).  Of course Blockstream and Core have the better track record of improving the protocol, but then Roger Ver has a history of helping adoption by accepting Bitcoin for his business early on and I believe he gave away many coins in the beginning (again, correct if wrong - Ive seen one video of him doing so but the rest is anecdotal).
So does 2X really have replay protection now?  Is it not an attack now, or at least, less of one?

In your analogy, the gas station *always offered* 5 litres, the creator of the gas station just mentioned one time 8 years ago that offering more is something that could happen, and some people associated with the gas station but without control expressed an interest in offering more than 5.

That's what I've been saying into the downvoting masses: why doesn't Core just do a hardfork doubling block size and weight and diffuse the whole thing.  They don't think they have to compromise to get things they want though.  So instead of compromising they risk losing the name "Bitcoin".

I want SW as well but I no longer think it will make the price jump.  Bitcoin is quite enigmatic; the expected outcome is not usually the reality.  Also, Litecoin has it now and the price is no better than before it.  You're not the only one pricing in the expected adoption of SW.

Finite supply is but one of Bitcoin's value propositions.  Anyone can make a new alt with a finite supply.  Strong network effects, low fees, and being the network with the most hashpower are some of the *other* value propositions.  It does seem like bitcoin is losing momentum in these areas and it's likely the ongoing block size debate has a lot to do with it.

Maybe bc they realize that, in this space, social/community influence matters as much as tech. 
So, even if they think they have the technical advantage, they know they don't have the social advantage, which is what can sway the "economic majority" that disagrees with (what they think is) their better tech.

Of course there will be some type of lower-case "g" governance.  We see what we get with modern nation-states.  Maybe that will be the best humanity has forever, but I can't help but think there's better and freer.  I doubt we will see Anarcho-Capitalism on Earth as too much area already taken by States with their war machines but I look forward to it being tried in space (I do watch Liberland closely, though).  I suspect a system like that would be better for most people but we can't really say bc we don't have analogous systems to compare in the modern world.  I think it deserves a shot, though. 
At any rate, I work from first principles, and my first principle is that adult human interaction should be voluntary, and that is defeated right off the bat with modern nation states.

Lol no he wants to do something to scale *on-chain*, preferably as slowly as possible so he can keep racking up the record high fees.   Same thing I would do in that situation.

OK... an *educated* guess.  Even evolution is just a guess.


OK: "I don't really care if we lose 75% of the 8 nodes in Africa if it means I can actually use this technology without spending a week's wage to transfer it".
SW and bigger blocks are both needed.  Not sure what other point you're trying to make.  When 2mb blocks happen next year you can tracl what happens to the number of nodes.

Damn I was just in the middle of a blog post asking whether or not Bitcoin can literally go to the moon (or Mars).  Guess I have some new info to use now.  Was wondering what amount of bandwidth/latency was necessary.  Mars is up to 1000x further away (and the distance fluctuates) so that's the real challenge.  Seems like consensus would be you can run a full node on the Moon, but not on Mars.  Perhaps you could even mine on the moon, but you wouldnt have the latency on Mars.

He's mostly right, even though of course his reasons for pumping Eth are obvious.  They're both great; there's other great alts, too.

Either way I've always been pro-SW; never claimed not to be.  I'm pro bigger-block HF too.  I own a bunch of coins so I don't care about which one "wins" or how it happens.  I'd be fine with a contentious split even.  Give each side what they want and see how it shakes out.  If "bitcoin" comes out doing well and gaining traction or some other coin takes over big deal.

Most people don't realize that part of anarchy/freedom is the ability to choose your own governance system.

@_date: 2017-05-30 02:11:44


Its mind blowing that people cannot see this for exactly what it is.
Not sure what other point you're trying to make
Andreas hasn't picked one side or the other, he has said that both are probably needed, like I said.
I suspect that as we grow block size (either way) the number of transactions and nodes will increase.  We have real world data on node count over time and can see the number of nodes going up even as the blocks get bigger.  There's a correlation between transactions and nodes it seems.  More uses, more users, more transactions, more companies, more nodes.  I'm totally happy with the COOP agreement.
Also, SW and LN was never going to be all that quick of a fix, whereas blocksize is pretty immediate.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:53:39

@_date: 2016-05-01 03:59:24
That's what I keep thinking about is why would this ever emerge?  Perhaps instead of buying stock in a business, you buy stock (coins) in a person, which means ALL of their business with however many parties and revenue streams they have, so the coins basically pay a return on a person's productivity.  Call them People Productivity Stocks or something.  For example I could buy a share of Lebron James, so I'd get some return from his salary, some from his endorsements, some from his investments, etc... Don't know that they would need to be in the form of a coin, though.

If I were in Jihan's shoes I would try to keep raking in these fees as long as possible.  I may even lie to westerners and others if it meant I keep control and high fees.  If I were Ver I would want as little fees as possible to facilitate mass adoption and the libertarian dream of stateless cash.  If I were the large group of engineers that make up Core I would provide technical expertise about all the possibilities.  If I were a simple hodler I would want the quickest possible way to allow for more and cheaper transactions.

Actually a Bitcoin wallet is more "set it and forget it" than a credit card bc they don't expire and require you to change any autobilling (there is no autobilling built in right now), they don't have strips that wear out, and they don't get lost as easily or if they do they are able to be "found" from a seed you possess rather than by waiting for a new one in the mail.

If you are banned was it done by a person or was it just some universal comment score threshold that you triggered? They may not even set that policy.  To me a ban is when a human moderator decides to actually prevent someone from commenting in a sub outright.

In the end, there is no profit?
You can take your model and also apply it to the services that I assume you think the automatons are buying from humans and the manufacturers themselves.  Take it all the way through the chain and humans aren't doing anything for profit anymore.  That's pretty much the singularity.
Certainly one can envision this path and even suggest it is what *should* happen, but humans sure like controlling things, including other people, and improving their lot relative to others and profit seems to be a mechanic for pursuing this.

Everything is a trade-off.  No one knows how many potential and/or current users we are losing due to rising fees/small blocks and it's hard to say exactly how much more centralized the system would become with bigger blocks.  But we do know that the real value proposition of Bitcoin is its immutability and censorship resistance and only one of those two tradeoffs affects that, so let's avoid that one.

No.  If 100% of the adults within the jurisdiction of the US had voted for each elected official then you would be correct.  There's a reason I keep mentioning affirmative consent.

I'm a longtime hodler in my 30s and I agree.  Even if somehow Bitcoin "dies" something with better governance and hopefully no ASIC mining will take over (or maybe this coin is now called Bitcoin).  Some people are just attached to the value of their coins, which is natural.

So then following your logic you should expect car manufacturers to retain ownership at the beginning, more profitable part of the car's life-cycle and slowly transition to the car owning itself over time?  Why are we so sure a human won't offer just a bit more so *they* can own the car and, let's say, recoup the costs by selling the parts/raw materials at end of life-cycle (edit: I realize this will be priced-in from the beginning)?  I think there will always be a human/company willing to take control.  I'm not saying it's impossible but so many new aspects of our economy would have to change.  I think for the foreseeable future we will still have humans owning property, even if it's abstracted away from the consumer caring or even knowing about it.

Go check my post history and then tell me who is the moron.
There's no definitive proof that bigger blocks will lead to more centralization, just speculation.  Certainly 1TB blocks would, but 2mb?  Quite possibly it would drive adoption that would end up increasing decentralization by most measures.
Way to be nuanced, though.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:56:13
No, you need to do some more reading if you think this is how property is defined in Ancap.  Locke's Labor Theory of Property specifically.
And, again, if you have a group of people who all own property that affirmatively consent to pooling their property, they could do so.  Ancap allows other systems to exist inside of it.  Any system that doesn't claim ownership over others' property, that is.
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:54:15

If you're implying I'm some rbtc troll feel free to check my history and be humbled.  I'm for UASF, SW, all that shit, not that it matters bc I'm just a user with no hashing power or economically significant node.  I simply said there's no proof that bigger blocks necessarily lessen decentralization (assuming we could even degree on terms here), and guess what?  I'm 100% right, while you're just calling names and, inexplicably, even bringing nationality into it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:19:40

Maybe.  Or it could be someone who owns hundreds of bitcoins and it wont effect them much at all.

@_date: 2017-06-15 22:59:00
No it will almost definitely be 2140 because the difficulty is periodically adjusted so that blocks average 10 minutes.
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:46:38
Obviously there's some of that going on but it's overstated.  There's no way 85% of purchasing power is by or "heavily" influenced by women, especially when they supposedly make .77 on the dollar.  There are slightly more women (51%) and I can even buy the idea of women holding more wealth overall since men die earlier and leave it to their spouse (like my millionaire grandma who never worked a paying job) but there's simply no way it's "more than 85%" unless you use meaningless words.
I'd love to see the actual data set that comes from, but, alas, you can't.  It was probably something like a poll where they asked recent purchasers "Did a female have any influence at all on your purchase of X?" and then they added that number to all women purchasers and got these insanely high numbers.

Incumbency protection.

Depends on how it's implements by wallets, exchanges, etc... it may become the default and thus used by most people/txs.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:34:02
My point is it's not "proven".  It's possible that going to 2mb blocks would drive more adoption, giving us more users, nodes, miners, etc... AKA *more* decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:22:05

Yes those are theories too.  If you think blocksize as related to decentralization is so proven then please tell me the exact amount of nodes, mining, etc... that we will have for each possible blocksize and let's bet money on it.  I'm sure you have a foolproof formula ready, right?


Evidence is what is gathered to try prove something.  This isn't really hard man.  Ever seen a case in court?


Then why isn't it?


Thank you.
Why did you not answer my question about the first 100 blocks and their size vs hoe decentralized the network was?

You must be describing their transactions (DAO fork) or their coin cap (isn't one).
I own almost as much eth as BTC so I don't really care.  I hope the whole.space just keeps absorbing dollars.

Sounds like you're confusing a system of rules without rulers with being a murderer.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:54:22
We both have only a hypothesis about what will happen if we raise the size of blocks to 2mb.  Even once we do it and have results  we won't be able to isolate  that variable bc BTC has too many moving parts.  But you're so strident that  you have "proof"!  So, then, please present this "proof" or stfu.  
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:20:33
My point is it's kind of an empty statement.  You have to come to ideological agreement about the larger direction, and then engineer the best way to get there.  So the right way to say it would be something like "political solution before engineering solution".
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:37:51
There are other coins to mine besides just BTC and eth.

If you have studied this subject much at all you would know the answer to your question.    Individuals are responsible for this own protection; there's no free riding.  If your neighbor buys private security and you don't, they are protected and you aren't.  This is like Ancap 101.

@_date: 2017-06-04 00:38:22
I understand this argument and I suppose you can make a case for it, but I think it ends up failing because it would apply equally to *any* situation the world is in, and "anarchy" can't mean "any situation the world is in".
But, thinking within that framework, I would say, then, that the US (really any nation) is a cartel that needs be overthrown.
The key issue for me is affirmative consent.  By adults.

The real problem, as usual is the State.  Specifically the threat of State violence underwriting the protection of IP (ASICBoost).  
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:33:16
It would probably seal the deal for 148 tho.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:34:41
Yea I agree.  I'm just wondering if its protection from taxes you seek, or protection from attackers - but I repeat myself.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:45:29
I'll say it again: either let Jihan "win" (keep ASICBoost) or let "eth" win ( crypto spot/attention).  Pick one.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:26:19
Yea it's about raising the block size too.  I forget who suggested we do that.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:28:28
And pay a fee to open and close the channel.  I think some big holders will run lightning very near zero at the beginning just to help the network though.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:29:09
Well they both *matter*  but the covert version is more important I feel bc it gives one company more knowledge about what's going on than the others, and knowledge is power
At any rate, I'm against IP in general as it is a farcical concept dreamed up by lawyers and backed up by the threat of state violence.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:50:49
Then just make a BagHolderCoin with literally zero technical purpose and that is outrightly for speculation only, and see how much it raises.  Probably would do about average for an ico.

Im perfectly aware of the status quo.  You're welcome to present your ideal system of human organization and then compare and contrast the two.
Ancap is the moral perfection to aspire to though it may never be achieved.  Perhaps one day on a new planet, when were all connected through a neural lace, it will be.

The miners pick which transactions to include in the block and collect the fee attached to each transaction.  They could purposefully ignore transactions (some already do this to have a higher chance of being the one to find the next block) but they are leaving money on the table by doing so.

Miners will be the ones responsible if anything happens so I'm not going to feel real sorry for them.  They knew the risks going in.  Also, they could mine other coins.

This sounds like more witch-hunting.
It's a communications platform.  People can use paid tweets for traditional advertising, brand awareness, just getting a message they like out there... any number of things.  
If someone made a site exclusively for the purpose of slandering people or something unethical that would be a problem.  Preferring big blocks is just an opinion.  The dude owns a ton of btc.  Do you really think he doesn't want it to do well.  People just have different views about the right way to do that.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:01:35
I was being snarky.  I *did* listen to all arguments and have been fine with bigger blocks as needed and of course SW too.  I just think it's hypocritical that many of those against raising block size are totally ok with it as part of SW.
