I have to agree with you. I love going back to cali now and then but every time that enter the state I feel like I am going to get arrested for walking on the wrong patch of grass or something. When I leave cali I always feel like, "Aha! I got out without them noticing all of the offenses that I must have committed while there!"

It will simply take time for the market on it to settle.  The people involved now are technologists and speculators.  After the general public is (if ever) incorporated into the process then it will likely stabilize.  Until then, it's lots of fun.

"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the--if he--if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not--that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement..."
Ahh Clinton, actually missing him at this point.

California is like that hot insane chick you screwed in college.  Sure she was hot and you kept coming back to her but every time she opened her mouth you realized how messed up in the head she was.

So much ignorance.  I have only been into it a few weeks and I know far more than that.  So many cracks in his argument.

I thought the fed, not the states only had authority to regulate currency?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:55:04
WEll let me put it this way, states don't have the authority to create a currency. 5th clause, article 1 in the constitution.  Now I know things have changed, but...
