What we are seeing is the calm before the storm. I suggest everyone back up the truck and load up. We'll be looking back at this $666 stage with nostalgia. The $1,000 mark is coming before August 1.

That little dip was nothing but healthy profit-taking from traders. Don't forget that not all participants are like you and me - hold 4Ever types. There are some heavy hitters here who are only in it for the money. I say let them do what they do. But we will be back above $675 by midnight tonight.

Any dip below $666 is a buy buy buy signal. I'm surprised how fast my bitcoin piggyback is increasing.

Have you seen the spreads? It went from like .50 to 2.50 now. That's the sign of a healthy market and further volatility. No one knows what to do and the bidding and selling is rampant like on the mercantile exchanges. Think about thatogie with Eddie Murphy.

Damned good idea. We need to start this ticketmaster disruption business right now. Umm, we can meet in my basement - I'll just have to get my 14-year old brother off the xbox for like 2 hours but I think I can manage.

Sounds like much ado about nothing to me.

The good professor knows his economic theory and value with respect to tangible commodities but he's out of his league with this newfangled shit. What would he know about bitcoins? He's trying to compare it to oil and gold. That's like comparing apples to an ant farm.

They want to be the google of bitcoin. I'm not even sure if I understand that or even want to. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:13:00
I'll bet this crackhead professor 2 bitcoins that we don't go to $10 by the end of June. Put your money where your mouth is professor boy!

Coinbase will let you set up recurring buys. I do it weekly. But what I really like is coinbaseorders.com. They let you set up limit orders to buy and sell. You can set a buy order for like 501 and if it comes that low at any time it triggers a buy order. I'm looking at the current correction to come to $495 and then it goes back up again.

I can tell you with no hesitation that this little lullabye is a good thing. It means that sellers are not selling out of fear. It's stable. Now the smallest good news to come out anywhere will propel Us $50 or so. Believe it. It's on the internet!

Really people - never advise a self-professed young person to put all their money into a risky thing like bitcoin. Yeah it's risky as hell. At least IBM stock has no way if going to $0.00. Bitcoin does, even though the odds are slight. This is purely speculation. Assume your bitcoin "investment" can go "poof" tomorrow and you will still be ok. No more than 20% of ones savings.

I dont know about legitimacy, but it has proven that froth and wild displays of optimism are not only the hallmarks of internet stocks anymore.

Was I the only one that saw no value in this report? He could have said simply "the sky is blue" and it would have been the same thing.

Diversification is what the experts tell us to do in order to keep our returns mediocre. Who ever got rich diversifying all day? I say no! to diversification. Go large with bitcoin and don't lose more than you can afford. Even google pales in comparison. I say close your eyes and put 40% of your investable assets in bitcoin. Them put on your safety belt. It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

Banks do it because we have had no other alternative. My bank Comerica is the worst. You can change banks but they're all the same in the end. I think putting half your savings into bitcoin is a bit extreme though. Maybe some dividend paying stocks or a nice little ETF?

I called $500 first! Haha! All those bearish wonks cry in your beer. We ain't done yet! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:55:43
Who was that wonk that predicted $250 by the end of the month? Come out come out wherever you are...

Am I missing something here? Bit stamp is trying to verify the source of a bitcoin? It's there anyways. It's a part of the protocol. Why is there concern?

Dude, this is what crypto currency is all about. Power to the people. Now if you Nepalis can only get a decent cricket team you'd be mobsters.

Predicting $500 before June 30. Any bears want to make bit interesting?

I have nothing to add to this discussion. The 5 points made are just beautifully laid out. I memorized them word for word.

I want to see this respectable professor from this old stodgy boston university on July 1st. I'll egg his face in effigy.

Hey I own the world's only truck driving school to accept bitcoin. I can lay claim to this and I can prove it. Yes, I want a cookie now.

These two lottery winners think we care about their opinions as to what to invest in. Why does the world think these twin boneheads are worth listening to?

When we go to work Tuesday, we'll be looking askance at $600 and lathering up for $700.

Never sell I say! Buy and hold. Hold and buy! When you're gone, your kids will hold. Then one day, it will be overshadowed by something else - something new and improved! The next big thing will have arrived. Something with only half the quantity and double the security. Bitcoin will go the way of the internal combustion engine. You'll feel like having come off of a roller coaster and songs will be played about what a "long, strange" trip it's been. That is the true legacy and soul of bitcoin.
