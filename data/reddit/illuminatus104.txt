I can't worry about something I'm ignorant of. This is surprising, if it's true. Is that why transaction speeds have seemed to slow down?

first people were posting sarcastic remarks about small merchants accepting bitcoin. "oh, XX vendor accepts bitcoins now...who gives a shit!". now, it's "oh look, Dell accepts bitcoins. Who gives a shit though, they are just exchanging them!". 
What next? "Oh, Ebay acepts bitcoins and hodls them. Who gives a shit though, because now eBay is going to hoard bitcoins!"

So cgminer/bfg/ect.. all run on the same principle code? 
If I created my own mining software that said 50% of mining profits go to my address, people would obviously not mine on it. How can I be sure someone hasn't modified a version of cgminer that sends a small amount of mining profits to a wallet? 
By "kosher" you mean fair and judicious to all involved parties? It wouldn't be sensible to write code designed to screw a user

Ok, now I'm absolutely hooked on understanding this. I've got to get it so I can explain to others
I still don't understand changing the code part. What code do you modify so that the change is implemented in the whole system, as long as it's agreed upon? I don't get where the modification is hosted, if this makes sense. Where is it derived from? 
I get the miner part. You download the program and have an opportunity to inspect the code and decide if you agree. If you don't, then you don't mine and if enough people don't mine, that protocol fails. I understand this form of modification that can be made.
Maybe my real question is this: How would I introduce code and have people "vote" on it?

It's like the US Constitution, minus humans. All laws (altcoins) are derived from the Constitution (Protocol). The laws have to abide by the Constitution (protocol) unless the citizens decide to introduce a new law (altcoin) that changes the constitution (protocol), as long as the majority agree with this. 
Laws = altcoins then (doge, BC, Mint, ect..)? They all use the same protocol, but have slight modifications (interest rates, transaction speed)
So the genius of bitcoin is in the protocol. Someone came up with a Constitution that can be run by mathematics, instead of humans. Thus eliminating what screwed the Constitution in the first place. This protocol introduces a truly objective ruler. Blind justice, the real thing.

I'm not sure why people think Bitcoin is this "thing" that will/does allow people to circumvent government. Bitcoin will not change much in terms of power structures. The wealthy are already in Bitcoin. Maybe a few missed the boat and will get weeded out, and a few will ride the wave up (Bitcoin millionaires). But other than that, not much is going to change. Banks will adjust to this new technology. We will see companies like Western Union and eBay slip away like Blockbuster. These are all quite minor though. New middlemen will spring up to replace the function of banks (arbiters will be needed for smart contracts). 
Bitcoin is not this utopian producing technology some people here are purporting it to be. It is certainly going to shake the game up, but fundamentally, little is going to change. 
There are problems with Bitcoin also (ie - privacy concerns). Government will know everything about where/how you spend your money. Don't think government will have transparent spending either. They will get around this.

Bitcoins were probably not designed to be anonymous (hence their lack of anonymity). I don't think the entire purpose of BTC was to enable anonymous transactions.

This will certainly be interesting. The state wasn't able to regulate the internet; now will they be able to regulate something housed ON the internet? 
Though regulation of bitcoin is easier than internet because there are already rules in place for currencies. It'll require some changing of language but the groundwork is already there. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:11:01
banks aren't going away. middlemen aren't going away. people are going to want an intermediary even once bitcoin goes mainstream. the average person doesn't have the technical knowledge to properly secure and transact coins on their own.

How do I decide which protocol I'm going to use? Mining software? 
I understand the consensus idea. I don't get how a miner would utilize a different protocol.

I like this, I can use this metaphor. What happens if I make rules that some agree with and some don't? Say, almost an even split.

Who gets transaction fees once the mining phase is over? From what I understand, the miners get transaction fees in addition to the block reward. Would people mine for transaction fees?

smart banks will gradually migrate once they figure out how to make it work for them. there doesn't seem to be a reason to believe that banks are "anti-bitcoin". seems like people just want a conspiracy to think about. 
i've said this before - bitcoin isn't going to change much in terms of power structures. bitcoin isn't going to give the average person a leg up in the financial markets. it's going to be great for two types of people:
1)the unbanked, third world people 
2) startups 
the average person is barely going to notice anything different once bitcoin integration becomes full fledged.  sorry guys, Bitcoin isn't going to be the fantasy you thought it would be

Oh, I see. So the users have a great deal of power. It's very easy to opt out and move onto a different coin. 
Doesn't this make it easy to destroy the coin though? If, for whatever reason, there was a person who hated Bitcoin and wanted to sabotage it, what's stopping them from doing that? We could just connect to a different "node" that we deemed legitimate? But coins still work in another version of the protocol?

Biologists use the term "commensalistic" to describe one organism benefiting from another organism, but the other organism receives no benefit from the first. 
Purse.io is using amazon, but amazon is not using purse.io. Purse.io is independently taking advantage of Amazon's system (no negative connotation intended) without being in a partnership with Amazon. 
I see no problem with what Purse.io is doing
