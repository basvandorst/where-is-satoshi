His point is that there is a massive amount of consumer protection that comes with the credit cards that is utterly lacking with Bitcoin. An average joe is never going to use the latter if this situation stays the same. Telling someone that they are protected by "math" to people who think a quarter pounder is bigger than a third pounder is hopeless.

It seems that lately anytime this subreddit pops up in my feed it's some kind of crazy bullshit story easily verifiable as such through the means of a few Google clicks or an insane conspiracy theory of some sort. I am not sure what's going on.

That I couldn't tell you but if you are a high volatility stock of the likes of overstock that doesn't shock me. Their CEO has been very ughh "vocal".

Yeah I was hoping to see another elliptic encryption scandal yet all I saw was a compilation of existing material, most of it 4 or more years old.

LIBOR is NOT an index. There are indices out there tracking LIBOR but that's a separate story. Completely unrelated.

Before calling something stupid you might want to read up on what a financial index is (hint: it's more complicated than you think). Here is a very very basic primer:

What the hell is wrong with you people? The guy is on the record [trying to order assassinations]( of people, and you are acting like he's the second coming of Christ.

It wasn't a hack. The individual in question had obtained group's login credentials for the site and attempted to unload a lot of currency. Subsequent rollback, etc. ensued. 
Edit: jmw74 suggests that it was a DB hack. Looking...

I simply don't trust bitfloor. If they got hacked before it could happen again.

[Bitfloor]( sure is doing great. Keep up with that stellar advice of yours.

So how is your trading on [bitfloor]( going?

It's a tough problem to be sure. The ledger is already huge. My last sync took two weeks. Somehow I think some major parts of this will need will need to be redesigned if bitcoin hits retail transactions.

That I'm on board with, as long as these things are run by knowledgeable individuals. The marketplace is so small right now that there are simply no good alternatives to Mt Gox in terms of expertise. Exchanges are notoriously hard to set up. I spent a good chunk of my career developing against electronic tading ESBs and the amount of knowledge required for even simple things (Quote for Ticker?) is astonishing nowadays. If the team who was in charge of rewriting LSE infrastructure after .NET fiasco would open a BitCoin exchange I'd jump on it in a heartbeat.

The latest Daily Beast article is only making OP's point stronger: 
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:08:54
I think this is the beginning of the end for bitcoin as a viable future currency. Yes, it's a "default" which means that potentially you could tweak it. In reality you'd have to provide a substantial incentive for someone to verify these blocks and I don't see that happening any time soon. 
Bitcoin's divisibility was regularly brought up as a (somewhat weak) argument against the [Deflationary spiral]( I say "weak" because it's already brought the likes of Silk Road to its knees when prices upwards of $100 hit. Nevertheless it was an argument and it's one of the only ones out there.
Now, at a current price of around $120, 54.3 is roughly 0.6 cents. That's already in the realm of viable transactions (any system with real time interest rate comes to mind). If the value of BTC in nominal dollar terms jumps only 100x fold we are basically excluding BTC from the vast majority of future retail operations. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:03:05
My original premise was that I simply didn't think bitfloor was trustworthy or at least much less so compared to Mt Gox - which caused everyone to jump on my case. I sincerely hope some of those people like apples.

Banks do money transfers of this type all the time (verification and debit card "pinging")


Well, that's the problem with "hardcoding" any number-based default into the code. It should be something a lot more flexible, perhaps volume based.
