I've lost the last bits of respect for WSJ after their ridiculous accusations against PewDiePie. I'm not his fan or whatever, but how hungry for clicks you need to be to post such nonsense.

I think it's a long way for Bitcoin to pass to actually "threaten" central banks in any way.

You can say that she says nothing new, what she says is quite obvious, but not for people who have little to no knowledge whatsoever about cryptocurrencies. The process of today's financial and governmental system has been building for centuries, most people aren't so flexible to change from something they already know how operates and what seems for them to be working. Huge banks and corporations will surely fight against Bitcoin, because it brings changes that don't have positive sides for them.

Well, there does exist ICO campaigns that turned out to be scams. It may be necessary to warn newbies about frauds, to prevent people from losing money.

That's a strange connection you drew there. I've never said that. This one simple example of the scandal with Pewdiepie shows how the whole system of WSJ works. I mean, the story was approved by the editors, they never took it back with the apology, they continued developing it even with the backlash they got from it. Because that's what they wanted in the first place - scandal and attention, no matter what. That's why I can draw a conclusion that this is the way the whole office operates in all of their stories and news. I'm not saying they are all fake news, but they don't care if some stories turn out to be. And this particular article about China and Bitcoin is one more proof for me to believe that.

Man, Chinese are nuts, am I right? But seriously, so many questions I have about this video. Like, why?

I'm not talking about Pewdiepie right now. His situation is just a perfect example of WSJ's incompetence. What I'm trying to say is you need to do a research before publishing any piece of content. If you post anything just to bring attention and clicks without any fact-checking, you lose the right to be called a trustworthy news source.

Is there really so little updates about Bitcoin right now that I see more and more posts about something that happened in 2014-2015?
