For some context on this guy, Kim dot-com lives in New Zealand, where he pays events to let him have a DJ slot. Even in our tiny corner of the world this guy is a loser

I've been experiencing the stale thing really hard lately. I have all the things I thought I wanted but I'm often so bored. How do you fight stale?

Don't forget he spent time in jail, which is one of the sure signs of a guy with great integrity

To be clear, this woman is an economic reporter for this paper, she in no way represents the govt position on crypto. 
Her opinion is irrelevant, and dutch people interested in crypto will easily see through her garbage little article

You can invest slowly, diversify with etherium and some others maybe. Get a few Doge for shits and giggles

You left out the best part...
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:16:51
Yeah, it seems like they are screwing everyone on btc, but the alts are fine. This kind of dodgy practice makes me doubt 100 percent of what I read regarding btc.
It's like the community's lack of organisation will leave cryptocurrency open to major manipulation. The devs seem to lack basic PR knowhow
@_date: 2015-12-28 10:05:11
care to elaborate?
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:41:39
Thanks for your reply. I get where you're coming from, but what if the commercial application is between a set of companies that don't implicitly trust each other, and they all contribute to mining for the private chain?
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:36:02
I read the first article.....so many poor assumptions. If this is the kind of thinking behind bitcoin, it inclines me to sell up now
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:40:23
I was in the same boat exactly....got access restored in 24 hrs and no issue pulling out all my dogecoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:22:33
So you have the bitcoin faith I guess...

Who are banksters? What is a 'public citizen'? This fuckweasel woman is just spouting complete shit all over the screen. 
From what I could tell her only possible exposure to the workings of trade negotiation would have been as an intern prior to law school. So, fuck all in the way of actual credibility...
@_date: 2014-05-23 08:30:34
And all of New Zealand...
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:21:20
Yeah probably...they don't seem to have generated any significant traction against core anyway
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:01:28
Righto....I like the personal touch. Have signed up and sent a transaction. Can I use bitgo to keep some change on my phone? If not, I'll prob just keep the bc.i app with &lt;1 btc
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:40:43
You have to be kidding me! MasterCard block chain... What a joke
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:17:06
haha that's pretty funny. I just read the respective wikipedia pages about roger ver (cash) and adam back (blockstream). One has a history of working in crypto, contributing to major projects and a solid set of academic creds. The other is a convicted felon. Pretty easy to see where legitimacy lies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:12:49
Two questions. One, what is the point of this? Two, why is this company the subject of so much hate over on r/BTC? I can't get a straight answer from the cashtards....
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:47:25
Same... I had like 100000 Doge coin in their system!
@_date: 2015-08-05 05:18:05
This is helpful....next question then is what to use instead. I don't have time or expertise to do a paper wallet, and storing locally seems like it would be problematic if my machine breaks.....so what are the alternatives to blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:58:42
The thing is though, that the app is nice to use. The website works quite well, and there isn't any sense that it's as dodgy as everyone says. Also, I've kept a bit of btc on there for a few years and never had any problems...should I be concerned that I won't be able to get it out?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:24:00
This is a great question!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:55:41
I'm hoping like fuck for a massive down swing... 
@_date: 2015-08-05 05:31:41
So that's cool, but it looks like electron is vulnerable, at least according to the site you posted. So are these options really better than bc.i?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:42:13
I believe bitgo and possibly some other online wallets have removed support for authy because 'apparently' it has unresolved security issues
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:54:59
Where do you get your data?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:14:58
Great response, thanks. I read up about the blockstream CEO. He seems like a seriously legit leader in crypto, unlike the douchey crim behind cash
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:33:30
the fuck would any "blockchain ceo" know?
Dont get me wrong, I'm optimistic about btc,  and I'm glad it's doing well, but the wave of bullshit douche-baggery it has spawned is so disappointing
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:24:14
They won't but they might ask their 9million kids
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:04:52
You are, of course, free to blow your tuba here... But judging by your alcoholic logic and stubborn prose you sound like you'd be more suited to raging impotently in the comment threat of a Breitbart article.

No problem, fucko
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:34:54
sure, let's have a discussion about logic on fucking reddit
@_date: 2011-06-16 06:12:41
Hey, this is really interesting. Mind if I stay in touch with you? it will be interesting to see how we both get on. Also, once we get the hang of it, perhaps there is an opportunity to help others in NZ get in....
@_date: 2011-06-17 07:12:18
I've spent a good chunk of time getting started mining this week. What I've learned is that it is relatively straightforward to get started, but to optimise your system can require screwing around with some pretty technical shit. It's a good exercise though - I would recommend trying as it forces you to understand networks better.
What's your OS? Windows? For windows there are a couple of point and click apps I think. Head over to r/Bitcoinmining. And [here's]( where I posted pretty much the same question.
Check out your graphics spec, and cpu, then google around for bit-coin material related to that kit. Sign up at deepbit.org or one of the other pools and you're away....

When is this guy's inevitable arterial blockage going to shut him the fuck up? He's a con man and nothing more
@_date: 2016-10-02 20:44:30
Historic fraud convictions....he is a con man
@_date: 2016-10-02 20:44:09
His current legal predicament suggests he is a high risk investment. His prior fraud convictions suggest that said risky investment will be low return
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:11:15
Value of gold is representative of the energy required to get it....the principle is no different to Bitcoin proof of work concept
@_date: 2016-10-03 02:11:02
Ive seen first hand what this guy is about, and it really isn't good. He will align himself with a group, mimicking their ideals to get some attention and investment. Then take the cash and move on. It used to be anonymous, then pirate party, then occupy, now block chainers are the target. He is a predator, and people who want to believe in a cause are soft targets for pieces of shit like him. 
I'm not a fan of much of the US govt policy on this stuff either, don't get me wrong....there are various degrees of evil and it's hard to know who the real bad guys are. But in his particular case he is definitely a bad guy...and if a legitimate legal action can get him out of new Zealand then in my book that's ok. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:15:03
Thank you - I will follow this up. Have you been trading a lot?
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:59:51
Lol, This is so dumb
@_date: 2016-10-03 00:09:44
Haha he doesn't have a fucking clue. He has dragged it out for sure, but his resources are running out and the US will eventually wear him down. He is Winston in his own personal 1984....they will beat him in the end
@_date: 2011-06-16 06:11:03
Ok cool - that's actually very reassuring. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:59:39
This looks awesome
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:16:55
Dumb question... I keep my btc in bitgo. Do I have to move them out of there before the 1st? 
This bcc thing seems fucked up!

When you apply for the loan, are you going to tell them it's to speculate on Bitcoin?

As a New Zealander, let me apologise for these lunatics and their broadcast circlejerk. I'm embarrassed by these people, by the media, and by the general lack of imagination on display. 
It's sadly typical of this country though...as long as the farmers can milk their cows supposedly everything will be fine. Such a bunch of useless, myopic cunts.
