How embarrassing. 
"put announce..."? Even the last hurrah was a fail.
Did this guy actually sell his domain to someone earning off of page/ad views off of "fake" traffic? Is this what happened? Shady as fuck but that takes some balls...

There is no difference. This is a just a superficial tactic/PR stunt to return "confidence" to the sheeple.
Ignoring the obvious conflict of interest here, it's impossible for me to believe he did a competent security audit in one day. 
But the shills here will hail this as "self-regulation" and a success. But like andreas, these shills have significant financial interest in bitcoin's success. 
Isn't it amazing how skeptical these shills are about the fiat money, but their skepticism for bitcoin disappears because they have a financial stake in bitcoins?

What about the people who were trapped there? Also, there were people saying the everything was okay on gox. That it was just a glitch, a speed bump, etc. So who do you believe? 


And yet, the ceo was on the board of the bitcoin foundation. Not to mention that the exchange was the largest, most-respected and well-known bitcoin exchange in the world for a long time... 
Your argument is essentially the customer is at fault. If you go to a restaurant and they serve you poison, it's your own fault.

So if we vote for regulation, then it'd be okay? What a fucking retard. 


So it's the mtgox customers' fault... 
What a fucking retard.

It's hard to be clear headed about bitcoins when you have a vested interest in bitcoin's success. A lot of people desperately want to be in your position and will lie, cheat and steal to get there...


You deserve every cent you got. You took the risk, got lucky. No shame in that.

Amateur hour is over? Coinbase uses mongodb as their back-end? And you think amateur hour is over? The largest exchange by far just disappeared without an official announcement and without any recourse for the people who traded on it. And you think amateur hour is over? The winkle twins just created a bitcoin index called WINKdex. And you really think amateur hour is over?

Probably lying to gain sympathy. Besides, even if he had bitcoins in his exchange ( which would be shady as fuck ), he had ample time to take it out.

I've never bought any bitcoins. I don't own any bitcoins. I don't have bitcoin accounts anywhere...

If mt.gox announces that they are back in business tomorrow, OP will post that this is proof of bitcoin's resilience and hail it as a great victory for bitcoin.
Pure cult logic.

"In July 2013, Voorhees sold SatoshiDice to an anonymous investor for 126,315 bitcoins, valued at $11.5M （$99.3M as of Jan 30 2014), and described as the "first big Bitcoin acquisition""
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:40:21


Really. So if someone offered to sell you a bitcoin for $1000, you'd buy it? After all, it's simply going to go up right? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:44:42
Yes. If they have a $300K capital gain ( long-term or short term ), they could offset it completely. Somehow, I don't think the crowd will have to worry about that. 
Of course this is all predicated on them having official documentation from mtgox which doesn't mean to have its act together. And it's predicated on them having declared and paid capital gains taxes on them in previous years.
Lots of ifs...
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:06:00
No idea. But I'd imagine he has enough to care...
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:04:20
He says the doc was not produced at mtgox. It might be "others" trying to collude with mtgox to save it. 
Who knows. It's all a mess.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:26:11


It was moron. 


mt gox has been around for more than a year and a half...


Ooooh. Thanks for enlightening me.


There's a lot of disinformation as well moron. What a fucking retard. Have you been on the internet for a year and a half as well?


Except, you fucking reject, most of the reviews on yelp are phony reviews. Not to mention there is suspicion that yelp removes negative reviews when companies pay them. Or that businesses can buy advertising on yelp and have their positive reviews highlighted. 


So which exchange do you use?

You mean "announce put on mtgox.com".
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:09:43


You mean arbitrarily suspending trading, canceling trades, canceling withdrawals or just plain shutting down the website? Why can't they? What's to stop them? User complaints? 


We don't know if it is a scam or mtgox got robbed or what. That's the point. When lehman brothers went bankrupt we had the SEC and the government to look into it. Who's going to look into mtgox? 
There are no rules or regulations governing bitcoins. It's just a lot of people desperately trying to make tons of money ASAP. Somehow, bitcoin nutjobs think money corrupts those "evil bankers" but it won't corrupt the pure and innocent bitcoin evangelists. That's because money has corrupted their thinking already, but that's basic human nature.

Only $3K per year against your regular income. So if you lost $300K, you will have to live 100 years to fully take advantage of the losses. Of course you will have to have documentation and proof for the loss. 
It's amazing how the bitcoin fanatics like to turn everything into "good news'. It's like a cult.

Like a religious nutjob. Why is it your fault? Did you ask for it to be stolen? Maybe you didn't pray hard enough? 
I just don't understand this mentality. It's cultish thinking. What did you do wrong? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:12:27


You researched bitcoin "exchanges" and decided to use coinbase? I also researched and decided not to use coinbase. As soon as I learned they were using mongodb for their back-end, I knew not to use them.


Coinbase isn't a broker, they are bitcoin market makers. 
I'll continue to wait for real exchange or real bitcoin brokers before trading.

Where did I say anything about "1 happened a bit, 2 happened, but a big investor is buying out Gox's liabilities."
Also, how does that contradict anything I wrote. According to you, no matter what, it's a good thing for bitcoin. I'd laugh at you if you weren't so fucking pathetic.
