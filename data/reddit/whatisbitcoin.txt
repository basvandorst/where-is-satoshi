I appreciate the bitcoins, but I'm going to respectfully decline. People seem to think I'm begging or that I'm the one who did this. Not a very warm welcome (I'm not referring to you). I'll check out the sidebar and do a bit of reading since it genuinely has my interest but I don't see myself posting. It might have been smarter for whoever made them to use a different site to have people check bitcoins out if this is the normal welcome. 
For those who think i did it, this is how i came across them. I went to the bank to get singles, and these two bills were in there. I noticed them when I was putting Washington's head all in the same direction. 
Thank you to the people who posted genuinely helpful links. I've been busy all day and am just now sitting down.

OK. Let Mr figure this out. Be right back. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:43:40
 I think that's the right link. I couldn't copy any other from my phone.

@_date: 2013-12-11 16:49:26
Break is over. I will be back to check out the sidebar once Im off for the day. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:42:52
