What advice are you looking for? Sounds like you have a plan already. CoinBase is a terrible plan for the amount of fees you are going to pay. Use GDAX. Also you better have some sort of hardware or cold storage figured out. If you don’t know what that means then you have no business selling your family home for bitcoin. You should also DCA, again if you are not familiar with that you have lots of researching to do.

Everything you said has been validated, so I cannot say you are wrong. When a 26 year old, straight out of college, living in his parents house, asks if he should borrow $30k to invest in Bitcoin! I say NO every time!

Wish it was like that yesterday as I waited 9 hours for a transfer.

Just give it to me 
Just kidding don’t do that DONT ever do that. Don’t fall for scams that tell you to send a random address crypto. 
As far as trading your BCH to BTC, you can do that on coinBase. Are you asking for trading advice? Or are you asking how you can trade BCH to BTC?

Lol would you take out a $30k loan?
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:24:30
Hmmm. You try a service like shapeshift or changelly?
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:28:17
Fair enough lol

I hold business and personal finance in different regards. He deleted his post, not really sure why we are still conversing over this issue. I made my point, consider me risk averse. I just can’t get down with telling anyone to take out a loan to invest in something as volatile as crypto, much less dump it all on one asset. 
Your opinion is your opinion, I’m sure you will be a millionaire before me. I will continue to make subtle moves to ensure stability and security for me and my family. I won’t ever risk losing it all for the sake of adding a zero to my bank statement. There is more to life than money. Make a bunch of it and life can be awesome. Lose it all and it can be miserable. I’ll live somewhere in between. If I hit it big with crypto great, if I lose my investment, no sweat. 
Edit: I do appreciate the dialogue though. Thanks for taking the time to formulate professional responses and sensible scenarios.

My IQ is below 75 so I take offense to that.

And why do you insist on arguing? Just want to flex your internet muscles? The kid probably took out his loan and is now well on his way to the moon, congratulations. Meanwhile you and I are wasting away on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:52:39
Jesus lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:51:29
Who the hell is Ramsey, and why do you keep mentioning that name?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:47:30
Awesome response. I’m glad you analyzed this with such detail! Too many times do people come on Reddit looking for an answer in their favor, without their own due diligence. I admittedly, wrongfully lumped you in that general group. I really do hope for your success, and I think cutting your fun money is the best way to go about this. Congratulations on your new found investment strategy, I am sure you will be successful. Continue to stay on top of your investment during these turbulent times. 
The post shows [removed] on my interface. I did not see the updated post, but I will take a look. 
Happy HODLING my friend.

Why would you go into debt to invest? Take that extra $3,000 a month and dollar cost average. If you are looking to turn 30k into 60k in a year, go take out a loan and put 30k on Black at the roulette table. 
Even if you took the loan and invested it all at once, on one asset, most likely on one exchange (I hope to god you have a plan to store your coins), you have so much working against you. NOT SMART. This is how people slip into depressions because of crypto, making bad decisions like this.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:21:40
Yet here we are on Reddit. Lol you’re right. Hey dude take out $30k on a loan. Throw it all into bitcoin, solid plan. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:14:43
No but I would tell a 26 year old living in his parents basement to. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:35:22
I should say I am extremely anti debt. Cars are to be bought with cash, and houses are to be paid of as soon as possible. I wish I had this mindset before I mortgaged my house. Stay debt free, then invest all you want. 
I side with the idea of only putting forth capital that is less than 1% of your net worth and only 5-10% of your total investment portfolio. I expect this to grow past these limits, but I could not comfortably recommend investing more than that. 
Worst case scenario, this guy looses his ass on bitcoin and losses his job. He has no liquid assets, living at his parents house. He’s now forced to live in debt, or take on new debt to try and “fix” it. It’s a slippery slope and would NEVER recommend taking out any kind of loan (credit card purchases included) to invest in anything!
