Get a fireproof safe to keep trezor in (and perhaps keep the keys in a safety deposit box at the bank)

Made a purchase using my Coinbase USD balance for 8BTC and it's been "pending" with an "arrives today" message for 3 days (going on 4).  
I have;
1. Messaged them via their contact form, 
2. emailed them
3. posted in the forums
4. contacted them on twitter.  
Not a single response or even a ticket opened in their support system.  Just deafening silence.  Does conbase even care about their customers at all?

The Dollar hasn't?  


Yea, paper money that can be devalued at anytime by a central bank is super secure.
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:22:18
I still have yet to get a response on this matter.  This is 4 days now.

"I haven't heard much about it in a while"
I've also heard that a few times.  I kind of take it as a good sign.  Its still priced at almost 9K with most normies thinking it's still not around.

How about NOOOOO

Then, I don't think they are "manipulating he market" as much as they are taking on a lot more business; hence the large volume of buy orders of BTC.

Bitstamp...hardware wallet

Come on.  Help em out.
Yes, man... you can buy 0.02 BTC w/ USD (or any amount you want).  The amount of BTC you have won't go up.  will always be .02 BTC unless you buy more.   You may be able to sell the .02 BTC for more (or less) than what you paid for it.
.02 would be 2% of 1 BTC.  The USD price is based on 1 BTC.  So the value of that .02 BTC will be 2% of that USD price.  
Hope that helps (and shit)

It will get sorted out....just make sure you open a ticket now and tell them the ACH completed on the bank's end.  Mine was totally different as I made the purchase though my USD balance (not ACH); and there was some kind of problem that day with orders.   I no longer use Coinbase alone.  I spread my coins around between Coinbase and two other Wallet/Exchanges.

If I hear that same question from one more person.... 
And it usually comes from someone whom I told as far back 2-3 years ago to buy it.

The fact of the matter is that most people cannot avoid getting emotional about investments; especially when they are investing in what they don't understand.  
It's the same reason there is a trillion-dollar industry worth of unnecessary financial advisors; where many of them aren't worthy of anyone's trust at all.

lol an hour and 20 minutes bro.

What other exchanges &amp; wallets do you recommend that you are sure are safe?  I use Coinbase, but I'd like to spread my Coins between them and other exchanges/wallets.
