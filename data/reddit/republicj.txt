My only issue with Tor is that in the UK, apparently the very nature of running Tor makes the authorities suspect you of something, which may even include raiding your house?

How do you actually see some profit in holding bitcoin and trading if everything little thing you do incurs a fee that is likely greater than any increase in btc value? And further, the current price of btc is not actually the rate you'll buy it at, since its always inflated further to buy? It just seems like you're getting fleeced at every step of the process which is understandable but practically difficult. Should I be playing with greater sums of money? 
I currently dabble with block chain and bisq

I accept your apology, and I hope the rest of your day goes by pleasantly.

As in buy some, move to hardware wallet and sit on it while you study?

I can't send the vans from a bank transfer because of the limit, and I also don't have a bank ACC here because I'm not a Korean national

It's legal in both countries in the sense that the source of the cash is legal, and apparently btc is legal in both korea and the UK. I heard that btc itself is not taxable but rather what you do with as per normal cash. What do you think?

Can you dumb this down to a bitcoin noob
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:21:56
Thanks for that, I'll try my best to research and if it goes tits up I'll pay for advice

So basically, when I change btc to sterling, I'm going to be hit with capital gains tax at 28% (after personal allowance), unless I keep it in bitcoin form to stretch out the personal allowance over two years (although I don't want to keep that much on there because of the volatility). So all in all, I'll be paying capital gains tax as soon as I turn btc into sterling no matter what, is this correct?

Thanks for that. There are capital controls in korea so you physically can't take out a large sum like this, and i also don't have a Korean bank account as I'm not a Korean national anymore. I was thinking of doing the btc transfer in three or four chunks at a time, after I've established that it works and tried it couple times with small transfers. Do you really think its dangerous to the point where I can lose all my money? Can you recommend the safest one? Albeit with the fees (which is still lower than the 40% tax that korea may charge me if I move it out of the country as currency

Just a question - what do people consider as small amounts?
