By the way they are talking, they are trying to limit it to certain individuals as to try and save this business.

I'd feel more secure having a shot at my money now on a potentially insecure site then you guys going and filing for bankruptcy and taking my ETH and ETC with you

Your not going to be able to do anything when it opens so no point sitting in front of the computer. Just check in every now and then.

And you sir should be held liable for the coins you borrowed. Instead they are going to fuck the lenders like they have in the past.

You took the same stance on ETC as Polo did:
Terms of the Loan
As many of you know, unless you had ETH in your balances at the time of the fork, you did not receive ETC. For those who loaned their ETH to others, keep in mind that the terms of the loan dictate that you receive the same number and type of coins you loaned within X days plus the agreed upon interest. **The borrower does not owe you anything less than this, nor does the borrower owe you anything more, regardless of what may have occurred during the borrower's possession of your loaned coins. To assert otherwise on the matter is forcing a debt upon the borrower that undermines the loan terms that were agreed to by all parties.**

You should also let us get our ETH and ETC since they aren't affected considering the market is going crazy and you guys who are incompetent of properly watching the coins should be the last people holding on to them

So are you saying they are going to liquidate all the ETH I own to pay the BTC guys? Don't see how that's possible

Is there wording in the lending contract that states the borrower doesn't have to pay back what they borrow if they lose it?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:11:32
I hope to god you guys don't plan on cutting your losses by taking funds from everyone. I got cut out of ETC because it "wasn't fair" for me to get mine because it was lent out to someone else. If I hear it's "not fair" for the BTC holders to take the hit even though it was 100% theirs and had nothing to do with me I'll flip shit
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:26:01
Well they need to return the BTC that was lost by them. That's the fucking contract.. I borrowed this so I'll pay it back to you. Putting everything on the lender is absolute bullshit. People who go on margin are taking on the most risk, yet they are bailed out and actually have the least risk the way you guys are treating it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:38:04
Exactly.. so all lenders should be safe because the receiver can't loan out or move out the funds they borrowed. 
Oh wait.. finex doesn't let the reciever do it, they let someone else move out $70 mil and say.. oops.. we don't know how it happened.. our bad. Here.. you eat it! And we won't even talk about using a penny of our profits to help the fuck up we made. If anybody has noticed.. NEVER ONCE have they even shown they really give a fuck by talking about helping with losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:41:15
Are you guys serious? I just got screwed by not getting any ETC because my ETH was lent out. I was told it technically wasn't my ETH because it was lent out. I had to bite the bullet. NOW your going to tell me that If I had ETC and ETH lent out I'm liable to lose it. If we go by exactly how you made the first decision, THE BTC STOLEN IS NOT MINE, so how am I held accountable? ONCE AGAIN YOU ARE BAILING OUT THE BORROWER, for fucks sake. Some serious scam running here.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:18:35
Openness would be letting us withdraw our ETH that wasn't touched. Not claiming you want to make sure the site is safe. If ETH was in danger it would have already been taken. Let us have it for christs sake.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:01:55
Obviously. Unreal that even the BTC that was bought on margin was able to leave the site. Bitfinex left with every last dime.

Gotta love how he uses the word "customer losses" all the time. Whoever was in control of it fucking lost it.
