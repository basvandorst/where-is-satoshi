With investments done in terms of computer power, miners will not go offline until the cost is higher than the  marginal profit. Above I calculate the networks hash rate at the marginal cost.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:53:36
Rate is based on an average price from several sources. Since there is no real benchmark price yet for bitcoin it is hard to specify exactly what the fee is. We are obviously not doing this to lose money on all the investments. Doing this is actually harder than most people probably think. There is a reason this is one of the first public machines in Asia. There are legal risks, price risk, technical risks and so on and of course hardware costs, rent and so on. But we would really like to see Bitcoin flourish in Singapore so we rather charge less and see higher demand than the opposite! Pricing should be competitive. Thanks.

Why all the negative comments, these are good guys breaking new ground in the US. Never had the car salesman experience with Chris and Kyle.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:39:45
no, it is not, the guy in the article is not us.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:09:37
We are very excited to help spread this in Singapore. Singapore has taken a very pragmatic stance on Bitcoin so far. If you like to help us find a good location you can reach us on support Thank you guys!
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:15:15
Spreading around the world!
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:11:18
Correct, good point! But in reality those are comparable small....
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:05:52
No,  thats the point it will go to the marginal cost, just like we have seen in physical mining.

Nick Szabo was part of the cypherpunks list and used the email szabo He made this interesting post where he wrote about digital cash: 
After Bitcoin he seems to be looking for people to work with him on a C or C++ project for "bringing the Bitcoin revolution to other kinds of digital property".  Source:

No we dont. That is not our machine. This is someone who placed a machine in a small bar the other day. We have ours in one of the premiers shopping malls in Singapore! Right there, open to the public. For more info, see 
Thanks guys, Reddit is awesome!
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:45:25
One way to see it is that a higher price increases the Bitcoin security as an attack gets more costly. Also, the energy is not wasted, it is equal to the  monetary utility. One could argue gold mining is more wasteful as nature directly gets demolished.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:14:20
haha a bitcoin run
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:40:20
whats the point of continuing if it cant pay for electricity? Im not counting the hardware cost here
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:04:47
thing is I only gave it to people who expressed interested to have the gift, so hopefully they will take the time to figure it out... at least I hope so!
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:05:53
no, thing is I only gave them to people who wanted them....
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:09:40
also, with Blockchain.info youre able to claim them back in case they dont care to even open the email and transfer them...
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:16:36
Great news, will be sure to pay a visit to you guys soon!
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:02:30
correct, we would be happy to be open 24 hours....
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:37:11
again, we dont, not us. The article is someone else.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:49:01

Futhermore I dont believe there is a requirement to charget GST if the turnover of your business is less than $1M.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:23:50
No, because you can sell that electricity back to the utilities so there is an opportunity cost equal to the current rate.
