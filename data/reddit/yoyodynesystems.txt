That prediction is absurd. They probably want people to panic so they can buy in lower for the next level up. If you were them why would you say what you really think will happen? I can see 3300-3500 at lowest.

This is the same thing that happened on July 14th. But will be shorter in time frame on this drop. Last chance for sub 4000 coins. Then we have two more giant peaks. Just like the peaks from June 10th and Aug 16th. Just much much higher :P

No surprise. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. And when segwit activates we might see $5600-6000 within a month. I think $4500 was more of a rest area on the way. BTC network was fine with far less hashing power than there is today. As in years ago. And it can handle 50% drops from the current hashrate without major issue. As was clear this week.

Tomorrow it will read "Bitcoin price jumps past $5000"

I had to make my Reddit account finally just for this. Trader for 4 years of Altcoins here. 
-- You should wait to see if Bitcoin drops in the next day or two by 10-20 percent and if it does then your alts should see some gains. IF that happens then you should sell every single coin you bought. Sell them slowly if you have a lot of any one coin.
-- If Bitcoin starts going up again over 4200... again : you should sell every single coin you bought. Sell them quickly. Because if BTC is hitting all time highs then your Alts will drop even further.
Once you have all those Bitcoin. Hold them. Bitcoin will most likely reach 8000-12000 this year. Even if it drops back to 3000. Ignore that drop.
Learn to trade Altcoins by spending 100s of hours practicing with small amounts. Once you can trade at a profit over the long term --- Then you will know what to do with your full stack.

Let it play out. It's similar to natural evolution. Let the users and market decide. There are endless branches in evolution to determine the best versions. In terms of regular users buying things using crypto - let the sellers and buyers use any type of coin they please. There is room for all of them.

Close enough. 3480 was bottom and now we are at 4260.... want those lotto numbers? Okay... we are going to break 5k by mid October :)

The sooner China finally leaves the party the better. Rest of the world is ready for $BTC. Since January restrictions I assumed closure.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:26:33
$300 per exchange closure = negative $14,000 BTC. Buys are set! :P
Okay ... how about "Mostly priced in". Almost $2000 drop already since ATH. How much lower? $200... $500? Risk vs reward dropping. And the bounce should be rather large once they are all done announcing.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:18:33
Thoughts on this :
I think I might be on to something but I hope it's not too greedy to think we have two more giant peaks coming by the end of the year. Also... will be cool to link this in December if I am right!! :P
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:43:30
You are not going to sell after each exchange closes are you? Because they all are. And it's priced in. So don't throw your coins away. Good ... I knew you wouldn't :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:18:23
3300 is the bottom this time

It tanked? The price was 3200 when I wrote this. I was talking about priced in the drop from 5000 to low 3000s. So yeah it was literally priced in. If you played it for the last extra $200 drop - kudos to you sir! Ballllsssyyy.. many got locked out and now we are at 3800.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:48:18
Honestly I would not be surprised to see the price rise within 24 hours of the exchanges "closing". I think this not knowing thing is what is eating the market.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:23:07
Nice. So if crypto traders put 1% back into mining of the 130 billion in total market cap of all coins we could easily take over all mining from China in theory.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:28:53
Cool. Now China can shut down the exchanges twice :P. We keep falling for this!
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:27:24
Does anyone know the total amount of money currently invested in Bitcoin mining? Or at least the amount that has been spent in China? Trying to find out... rough estimate
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:50:16
So what if they ban (or heavily regulate) exchanges in China. They have already been doing this since at least January and price went up all year anyways. And we knew this would continue.
Maybe short term fear... but once it's over we are more free of China.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:35:50
My guess would be a drop of 10-15 percent with Huobi, Okcoin, and BTCC closing or being majorly restricted. Then price stabilizing within a few days to a week. Then we are back to normal with 5k to be broken by end of month. I really don't think anyone is surprised that China finally is going to try to stop the Exchanges. Just need to ride the coming dips and play them well.
Too bad these guys didn't locate in Hong Kong.

This post has the air of desperation. Don't worry bro... we will bounce.

I hope everyone is back in. Because 4400 range is not far off. Possibly by the 21st.
