ever heard the phrase "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"? 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:19:10
So bitcoin is the internet of money?

What world do you live in, in which every person has the same amount of freedom of choice?  
The purpose of government is to protect the rights of those who have less power.  
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:06:20
Yeah, if a lunatic  scam artist who takes advantage of paranoid Americans' fears of the government taking over their lives can get behind it.......
The possibilities are limitless.

Sure, that's true.  There is corruption.  Just like there would be if Bitcoin turns out to be the currency of the future and a majority the wealth is held by just a few.

I already don't use it! That was easy.

Reasons I don't like Bitcoin:
It is marketed as a currency but displays none of the traditional  characteristics of a currency.  For example, it's not a store of value.
Most bitcoin users claim that they want bitcoin use to be widespread, yet on an individual level they hope to get rich by hoarding bitcoins.  This is not going to work in the long-run.  It reminds me of the "I support public transport use by others" joke.  
Bitcoin and other cryptos are prone to hacking and theft and I would not feel confident putting significant amounts of my own wealth into it, as I'm not one of these extremely technically proficient people.  I need something that I can rely on and do easily, without scattering bits of encrypted passwords to the four corners of the earth in order to protect myself.

I don't know about where you live, but in Australia you need to show that speculative trading is your profession and claim gains AND losses on your tax return.  If it's a hobby, you can't claim gains or losses.

Just like a *real* currency!
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:19:19
Other than the potential to increase in value, what benefits does it have for me?  
I am discounting the fact that transaction costs are lower, because I would not use it in the sense of a traditional currency (as most users don't).

Whoever is in charge of setting the rules has the power.

Jesus christ, I support cryptos and all but this is just embarrassing.  Between the misspellings and the blatant lack of fact checking, this makes bitcoin seem like a total scam.  Even the Jehovah's witnesses brochures are better edited than this.  WTF!
Edit: Bitcoin is the internet of money.

I'm a financial adviser and I've been warning people about this for months.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:50:49
No.  Investing is when you buy assets.  Bitcoin is in no way an investment.   
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:39:35
Stocks typically pay you an ongoing income stream.  It's called a dividend.  
Investing in stocks is buying an income stream.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:12:16
The truth is that the real value of bitcoin is $0.  
The price is based on greed and fear.  
Buying bitcoin is in no way investing as bitcoin is not an asset.  You are simply gambling.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:33:29
No you don't.  
Inevitably your "investments" will go down to $0 at some point.  Someone will be left holding this hot potato.

Sunk cost theory - if it's risky to buy, it's just as risky to hold.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:40:30
That's a ridiculous analogy.  See all those companies on the NYSE?  They all do things.  Economic activities.  Real businesses, with real revenue, real assets and real dividend payments to shareholders.

1) Up to you but I'd sell.
2) Never take financial advice from uninformed, uneducated children on the internet ever again.  Take your financial advice from professionals and people who have lots of money.  
3) Learn a lesson - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
4) Invest in actual, real assets, that have a basis in reality, and not in a pipe dream that promises you can double your money overnight.

LIAR.  Stop it.  
People are putting their life savings into this shit because of stupid idiots like you.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:49:52
Why do they call it investing when they're clearly gamblers?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:20:11
The value of bitcoin is $0.  Less, if you count transaction fees.  The price is not tied to any sort of value.  It's tied to excitement, greed and fear.
