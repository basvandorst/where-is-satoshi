Yeah, those are details I don't really have, but I generally agree with the sentiment. The product is poised to make a big impact on a messy and fragmented, yet huge market, but 5x YoY is a hard growth rate to beat. 
Most of the people here are going to be hard to sell on the idea that there's a better investment vehicle than BTC itself, especially given the ridiculous returns over the last year. He thought it would be a good way to diversify without having to convert to fiat first.

That's kind of unfortunate, but I suppose it's already illegal (or at least not practical) for regular schmoes to buy interest in early stage companies with fiat. With the amount of VC attention that bitcoin startups are getting though, I think it's only a matter of time before someone raises a round in BTC.

My firefox is somehow compromised. I'm looking into it. What's basically happening with the request is this:
My computer --&gt; Malicious computer --&gt; MtGox
A cert is supposed to fix that from happening, but since firefox trusts StartSSL's root CA, my computer is contacting the malicious server (which must have registered a cert with StartSSL when MtGox was last compromised) and presents that cert to me. It then relays all traffic from the real mtgox and presumably captures the traffic for naugty purposes.
What I'm trying to find out is why firefox is resolving the bogus IP and how that mechanism got there.

The people in regulatory bureaus right now are tasked with enforcing existing law. Right now, bitcoin doesn't break any laws in and of itself. The laws may change as the lawmakers realize that this represents a threat to their entrenched power, but that hasn't happened yet. When you hear chuck schumer and diane feinstein talking about how BTC is used to buy drugs and printers that make scary looking guns, then you can start to worry.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure the browser isn't compromised now. Which is good, because I'm pretty security minded and it would be a big hit to my ego to get hijacked :D It's just really odd that they'd do something like this.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:49:03
Sorry, I didn't see anything about that. It's new to me :P Can you link it? I'm curious to see what they found out.

Apparently it's happening to [other users]( mtgox.com and  seem to be resolving different addresses.

Right now we've only really been considering accepting it as payment for our services (right now we only have the hiring/job seeking features fleshed out), not really as a vehicle for payments between customers. However, since we do provide for companies to post freelance gigs as part of their membership, it would be much simpler to operate a BTC escrow as part of our service than to use a third party in USD or roll our own. It would also totally eliminate the fiat exchange for say a German freelancer doing business with a US company. 
With that said though, if we did accept BTC, it would definitely be easy for us to pay our employees a piece of that as part of their compensation package. Since AFAIK it's recognized as an asset rather than a medium of exchange by the government, I'm not sure how taxation would go. Obviously if I was making $100k at 1:4 USD/BTC but putting a $250k mortgage on my taxes, the IRS would probably nail me for tax evasion. 
What's really cool is all the possibilities this opens up. I hadn't really considered us using BTC as a payment vehicle for customers, but you definitely got the gears turning for me.

I'm not sure (yet) that the startcom cert is legit. Either way, if the IP were correct, the CA wouldn't be an issue. 
I have tried it with extensions disabled.
I [replied to Urd]( with the cert names and thumbprints

I searched the sub for mtgox dns and only found one thing from a year ago. I actually searched a bit before I wrote my original post to see if there was something I was missing.

There isn't really much to it. On the buy side is what people have listed buy **limit orders** at. The sell side are the **limit orders** that sellers have posted. When you place a **market order**, which means buy or sell X number of coins at whatever the best price is, you either buy bitcoins at the price at the top of the sell stack or sell them at the price on top of the buy stack. 
When you place a **limit order** you're adding your offer to one column or the other at the price you're willing to buy or sell at. That order will eventually be filled if someone places a **market order** and you're at the top of the stack or a **limit order** that overlaps your order from the opposite side.

Is there anything else I need to do to get the discount? I sent the total minus the 0.01 discount and left a message referencing your comment above, but it still says partly paid. Do you just need to go in there and approve it?

I fall squarely into that group. I'm interested in it because it's the only thing in existence with the ability to break the crumby duopoly that visa and mastercard hold over online payments.
When you give an internet business a chance to boost their profit by 3% by cutting out the credit cardtel, that's a huge.

I'm running a startup employment and gig website and have been asking on this sub about embracing bitcoin for the last few days, but have gotten very little response. If people are interested, I'm definitely open to it, but so far it doesn't look like anyone is, at least enough to discuss it with me.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:47:19
Well, at least if they use the cloudflare cert, we know that at least cloudflare thinks they're legit. I've used startssl for my own stuff before and it's very simple to get a cert as long as you have access to the domain. If their own site is telling you to not log in unless the green EV designation is showing, you'd think they would have the presence of mind to get another EV for cloudflare.
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:22:38
No, I'm the programmer. I'm just weighing whether I'm going to see any additional traffic for embracing bitcoin.

Yeah, when I realized the discrepancy between the www and bare records, I was pretty sure at that point it wasn't a browser hijack. Still pretty shady though.

I've been using CBX for a while and their depth table has been the only decent way to check prices without logging in. They just moved the columns side by side instead of having them stacked and made it auto-refresh. 
Just thought I would give a shout out to a good USD alternative to gox as they make improvements.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:38:24
Does cloudflare publicly state that they use StartSSL?
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:00:39
After some discussion:
**It's probably legit**
Turns out that the dns and cert for  and  resolve differently. You can still hit  and get the EV cert.
**Sorry for the alarm, just trying to look out.**
Thanks to shadowde for the link to bitcointalk which explains it:  and uguuuu for realizing the dns addresses were resolving differently.
Now I'm going to go wade in a puddle of derp where I belong :/

Well, when we're talking financial trading, I'm going to take the exchange [at their word]( They apparently don't think it's secure for you to log in without using the EV cert, and I agree.

I seriously doubt it. MtGox's US subsidiary got shut down because it (for all practical purposes) lied on its regulatory filings with fincen. The government could care less about the other exchanges as long as they're complying with money laundering regulations.

Luckily I use campbx, which has matching certs on both chrome and ff, but I'm changing all my passwords to everything now :/
I'm leaving firefox in its compromised state in case I can be of any help in determining how this happened in order to prevent it. I'd really like to know if there's a mechanism in firefox that can override dns entries or if it's something that was injected. For now I'll be using a VM for everything.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:32:48
Good catch,  and mtgox.com resolve differently!
Sure enough, when I enter  it gives me the correct cert in firefox.

It looks to me as of now that the trick is getting noticed by the bitcoin community in the first place. This is the second post I've made asking this question and you're the first person to actually answer :/
I can see why it would be a little easier to rally support around an establishment that serves booze though than a career site based around privacy.
Thanks though!

Dumb question, are bitcoin stocks right now only for bitcoin-ecosystem type stuff? If so, is there any good reason that otherwise normal startups wouldn't do the same thing? Not sure exactly how it would work, but it seems that if you traded an asset (bitcoin) for another asset (interest in a company), the SEC rules probably wouldn't apply.

Don't hop on the circlejerk wagon quite so fast. They have to realize that BTC is an existential threat to them, I'd be amazed if they actually embraced it. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they come back in a few weeks after they "looked in to it further" and bashed it into the ground with negativity.

It's a site that hooks up professionals with opportunities such as jobs, freelance gigs, contracts and franchises. We focus on privacy so that people who are already employed don't get outed by their current employer or spammed by recruiters they don't want to bother with. I was asking whether it's worth it to accept bitcoin for the business end of it since we haven't launched the paid professional account yet. I'm also considering using a two-out-of-three bitcoin escrow system for freelance payments.

Nope, just harder to get it into mtgox. If you're in the USA, try campbx, they're actually legit under fincen.
