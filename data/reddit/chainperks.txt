As a consumer there aren't a lot of reasons for you to do that right now.  This is a serious problem holding bitcoin back.  
There are some merchants who offer some fixed discounts for spending bitcoin.
At chainperks we are building a product to help give consumers a reason to buy and spend bitcoins.  It's not ready for consumers to use yet but we are getting close.
Another option is to check out what the guys at  are doing.  If you drink starbucks you can save 20% on every coffee you buy using bitcoin.

Thanks! That's our goal.  We want to build services to help incentivize consumer adoption of bitcoin while helping merchants grow their bitcoin sales.  This way everyone wins.

stripe is likely your best option as they support both credit cards and bitcoin checkout.  Check out  and pm to me if you want to talk about incentives :)

Both! The dashboard is a passive feature we provide to help you monitor your sales and growth.  
The campaigns can be set up in a few clicks and we manage the whole thing for you.  Currently we offer four different campaign types, more coming soon!
There is an in-page widget you can use to promote the offers to your users if you'd like.

Hey RudayB!
I tried to reach out to you a few days ago after seeing your post about your photography business.  Would LOVE to chat with you over email/gchat/skype more about services you think would be helpful for merchants accepting bitcoin.
