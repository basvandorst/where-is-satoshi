For me, it's not the **word** *luck*, but the *tone* of the comment.  It came off rather derisive and almost accusatory.
But that's just me..

And you're welcome to your *opinion*.  **MY** opinion is that *I'M* impressed.
It may be luck, but he still managed to more than septuple his initial investment in about a month.
Luck or not, that is impressive to **me**.
Not sure, though, why others, such as *yourself* are hating so much on a guy that took a **GAMBLE** and, so far, has been **lucky** enough to be on the winning end.
I mean, at the end of the day, what does it matter to you, *neomanxl*?  Has his actions caused YOU any pain or hardship?  Have you lost your job/wife/kids because **anon_bitcoin_gambler** (notice the *GAMBLER* in the name) managed to increase his investment by a whopping 900%? 
If not, why all the hate?

Not sure what you're referring to.
I was talking about actual *stock market shares*.. apparently, by 2008, their stock had dropped to less than $1/share and they were told by the NYSE that they would be delisted if their stock didn't rise above $1/share within six months...

Interesting ...
Wonder if it means anything (big picture speaking).

One test tickle.
Two test tickles.
Oooohhh..... that works! TIL.
Thanks, **mistiry**!

Kudos for having the 'nads to pursue such a gamble..
Now, a month after your original post, your *$30,000* is worth approximately **$272,408.57 USD** (according to the weighted average on Mt.Gox).
Don't care what the others say, but THAT'S impressive.  Not sure what the rest of the year will bring, but good luck to you, sir.

Tried that.
It just adds one carriage return.  
Pushing enter four times (like I did just now) doesn't give me an extra carriage return that I'm looking for.

Wow.  So brave.
Labelling someone *stupid* because they took a risk you weren't willing to take on yourself.
&lt;slow clap&gt;
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:18:33
There's no way to enter Carriage Returns to separate paragraphs. (At least, I haven't found one..)  So I use periods.

Actually ..


We don't have an exact number of Bitcoins he's invested in.  I glossed over the *"slowly investing for the past two months"* part and assumed he bought **$30,000 worth of Bitcoins at $14/BTC**.
Without an accurate count of how many **actual** Bitcoins he's invested in, all my numbers are speculation.
My bad.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:56:20
According to the OP, he bought at $14/BTC.  As the time of posting (about a month ago) it was already up to $25/BTC.
When I posted *my* original reply to this thread, the exchange rate had a weighted average of about $125/BTC.
According to Bitcoincharts.com, mtgoxUSD's current exchange rate is $129.900, giving the OP **$278,357.14** as of 3:56PM EDT, 4.Apr.2013.

I was wondering about that outage.
When I tried to get an updated exchange rate, I was unable to get onto  .. my immediate thought was that Reddit broke the Internet again.. :-D
All in all, though, the **plunge** was about $20/BTC.  While that *is* nothing to sneeze at, it's **still** not as drastic as Nortel's precipitous drop a few years ago.. if memory serves, they went from over $145/share to something like $2/share...

(Not as cool as **fezzes**, but cool nonetheless.)
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:10:15
Google "bitcoin exchange rate" and see what the current value is.  Last time I checked, it was roughly $129.900/BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:17:16
According to the original post:


$30,000 / $14per Bitcoin = approximately 2142.85 Bitcoins.
This was posted about a month ago, when Bitcoins were *already* selling at $25 per Bitcoin.
Fast forward to TODAY, where Bitcoins are current around the $129 per Bitcoin range (depending on the source exchange you choose to verify - I looked it up on mt.gox).
2142.85 units * $129.900 = $278,356.22
