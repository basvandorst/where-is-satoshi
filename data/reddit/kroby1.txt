So in basic terms at .9% of the global monetary supply BTC will be at least $45,000/BTC?
*edit this is the most basic math applicable*

Yes, I’m asking theoretically if it were to be at .9% would that give it a value of $45,000/BTC

It’s always a troubling thought. But a good question to ask in terms of hodling long term; “Is this the next step in how we think of money” I think of it as a bet against the current financial institutions vs block chain payment p2p payment systems. I think the most authentic is a clear choice. But it’s about your trust that we can make a reality soon, which I think is not a possibility it’s a probability.

Bitcoin isn’t a stock therefore it doesn’t follow the exact principles of a company’s stock. Bitcoins market cap could far exceed those of private or public companies.

It depends on your situation. Do you have dependents? If so, save a slim part of your check every week and invest what you would like. It’s lucrative to get a loan but if anything were to happen you’ve got an even bigger problem on your hands because you’ve put others in a bad situation. However if you’re young, healthy, and not tied to any big responsibility take a shot.
