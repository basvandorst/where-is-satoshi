@_date: 2018-02-24 02:19:40
its not possible, it was just a bug. And they noticed it rather fast. After that happened &gt; price soared 12k &gt; 9k ish~ . Random bullshits like this, and stupid people, bring price down.

You can get it(last batch) for 1520$ with shipping and PSU. This automatically changes your math
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:19:59
Simple supply/demand, you can always buy 1, mine with it 2 months, and sell it for more, reddit/bitcoin talk/facebook. Even if you sell it for 2.5k people will buy it, and you have simply earned more, and after that you can buy 2 of them and have 1k left in your pocket(if we take in a count 500 per month)
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:55:09
