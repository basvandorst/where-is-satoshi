You mean 99.9% of the people who post in ?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:29:43


Its still way cheaper and faster to send ETH than BTC. Not sure how that classifies as ETH having "worse" scaling problems.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:21
I thought it was going to go to 0 dollars the first day? What happened?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:09:58
I want to believe 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:04:52


Hmmm you don't mean something like a futures market that allows them to naked short sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:06:38
Why doesn't Bitcoin have fast, low fee transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:05:33
Lmfao do you not understand how futures markets work?
You won't need Bitcoin to short Bitcoin.

I'm really starting to think this is whats happening 
I mean am I really supposed to believe that millions normal of people all over the world have contributed small increments of billions of dollars in 2 days to cause the price to jump from 12,000+ to over 16,000? 
People spending all this money are either idiots buying into the hype/propaganda or institutional investors preparing to short, or more likely both. But I doubt this is "mass adoption".
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:36:20
Thats not OP, flawless reading skills.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:10:45
I have BTC but I prefer BCH and XMR because they work.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:45:26
That's pretty much a perfect analogy of what OP is doing here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:58


Flawless argument, it's a bold strategy Cotton, lets see if it pays off for em.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:57:25
I thought about going all in on Cryptokitties but I can't even send my Etherum in Gemini anywhere for the past 3 days because of Cryptokitties.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:23
Because Bitcoin is broken
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:49
What are you going to say when Gemini adds Bitcoin Cash also?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:18
Or maybe hes already in and hes using his power to create FUD before he dumps his stack and shorts Bitcoin on Monday in the futures market.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:37:16
Well most libertarians wouldn't support net neutrality.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:19
It sounds like you are talking about XMR and not BTC.
Good luck sending your BTC anywhere with 200k+ growing unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:16
Most if not all exchanges charge a listing fee....
Bittrex does, Poloniex does, etc
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:09:29
Lol posts like this make me think I should sell everything
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:54
Okay. 
EVERYONE HOLD THE PRICE WILL NEVER GO DOWN 50%+ AGAIN!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:32
Well, Monero transactions do actually work and their development team actually develops.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:32:50
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:17:41


XMR will replace BTC as the defacto dark net market currency.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:29:57
I think I just had a seizure 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:57:56
Maybe because BCH is for spending? I thought you were just supposed to hold BTC forever? Thats how BTC works right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:57:01
Who wouldn't regret selling Bitcoin in the past at the new ATH unless they already made millions? lol also who would regret holding at an ATH  ?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:41:32
Who do you think Blockstream works for? Sure as shit aint whats in Bitcoins best interest for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:24
Neither of those are even real crypto
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:58:14
And here I thought there was going to be a sensible post in 10/10 Shitpost. You are delusional as fuck. How is it good that there are over 200k unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:25
I'm not worried about it but just because it comes back up doesnt mean it will right away. Just giving fair warning. Lots of new people are investing more money than they can afford to lose and taking out loans to buy BTC at these prices and saying its never going to crash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:34
You done fucked up son you sold the useful Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:05:36
Congrats would you like a medal? ETH is a good choice but IOTA and Ripple are total trash compared to most projects.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:06
I'm sure bank's, institutional money, and wall street will bet on Bitcoin going up in a futures market. Why wouldn't they? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:21
Who convinced you it was a good idea to sell at $200?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:00:51
Enjoy your "store of value" ™ and Bitcoin Tabs ®
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:17
What makes Bitcoin worth anymore now than it was in August?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:10
This is probably not a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:29
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:11:23
When the public has no more money left to
"buy the dip" wall street will short it.   
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:47:20
Because it actually works
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:51
I'm not saying it wont keep going up but its insane to expect it to never crash again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:50:34
So what does that make Bitcoin a currior pigeon?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:58:34
We feel bad for you. You are completely delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:51:31
You say that like it's not already happening 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:05:48
Taken to court for what? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:15:37
I'd be willing to bet this is already happening
