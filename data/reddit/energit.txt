I'm so tired of reading this. You absolutely can steal open source software. Look up Open-source software on wikipedia to see what conditions open source licenses can contain. 
Afaik the bitcoin source is released under the MIT license, which means pretty much the only way to steal it is to publish it under a different license.

The thing is that until we are at a 100% renewable system, even mining with renewable energy will always produce CO2 compared to not mining, because the renewable energy would otherwise be used elsewhere. Let's hope smart developers figure out Proof of Stake or something similar soon!

What about energy efficiency? Considering our current climate change efforts, wouldn't you want your main currency to not have a large electricity footprint?

Yeah, because taking important financial decisions together with their spouse is something only people with their balls cut off do. /s

I've found this to be true outside of reddit and the internet as well.

Just in case someone sees this and thinks it's a good tactic: It's not. Quick thought experiment: You want to buy in, the currency then appreciates to 111% of the initial value, then drops back to 105%. That's the next "significant dip". Buying at the beginning obviously saves money compared to buying after the dip. 
This scenario will be more common than you saving money if the investment is on a general upward trend - which you should be, if you think about buying as a long term investment! Don't be fooled, what describes *is* gambling/trying to time the bottom.

I just want to add there's nothing wrong with trying to time the market if you want to gamble/take risks/think you have an information advantage over the market.
Just don't call it safe or risk-minimizing. Try dollar-cost-averaging if you want more insurance from bitcoins fluctuations.
