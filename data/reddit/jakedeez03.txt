I won't say this is an AMA - I am the CFO - not a tech guy, so I can't answer all the questions people might have... that in mind, fire away...

They shut down the first auction because we said the profit would go to Charlie's commissary account, so I guess, now they won't.

How is this different from the key escrow idea that the US government put forth decades ago that got no traction?

The net profit will indeed goto charlie's commissary account.  If that is a problem, don't bid.

All net profit from the sale of this robot will go to Charlie's commissary account and to buy him things from his Amazon Wish List.

It was taken down because we were giving the profit to charlie and that is apparently not allowed on ebay.

I think the important part of this story is how awesome those lazzerbee.com wallets are!  (I'm not the cofounder of lazzerbee or anything, oh wait, yes I am)  ;)

No, lol, was candy.

Ironically enough, ebay.

Checkout bitcoin capital partners... Margaux specializes in this kind of deal.

I will say, I think that the $8.99 price is pretty reasonable since you're talking about a water proof polymer wallet that looks like a pretty awesome way to give out small amounts of btc as christmas gifts.

You should be happy, and sell half of them.  You should make sure you have no debt, and you should treat yourself to a really nice dinner.  Then you should keep living your life.
