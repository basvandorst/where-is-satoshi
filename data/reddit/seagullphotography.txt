That was good point. Thanks for the comment. I changed T&amp;C and made it more clear. Cash Backs will be in BTC if someone pays in BTC. But for the refunds (if someone changes mind within cooling off period), we will decide to refund in AUD or BTC. This is to stop refunds requests just in case BTC price jumps up in few days! Any suggestions for dealing with this kind of scenarios?

You are right, We somehow introduced Nowrouz and Bitcoin indirectly. I think it is going to be interesting, our clients are going to open up blockchain.info and start looking into hash code of the blocks that will come every 10 minute or so. I hope we don't get reversing blocks (forks) as this could be disappointing for some! As you said, Bitcoin is important to us. We have faith in Bitcoin and we see the long term success for it.
BTW, Our 20% off is for everyone, not just Bitcoin Payments!

Well! That's for a promotion period only! we like to price the services in BTC but it is too early now. Bitcoin has long way to go but we think it has got a bright future.

Thanks! Our business is legit and we hope to see a day that all the clients know about bitcoin and are able to pay by bitcoin.

I know what you mean! No we are not one of those photographers. Those traditional photographers are not quite aware that we are living in digital era, and people like sharing photos in social media rather than printing it and hanging it off the wall! We give the files of the photographs in original size and our clients are able to print it or do whatever they want with their photos!

The reason we started accepting and promoting bitcoin is that in our last promotion, we were disappointed with the delay in transfers between the banks. It was taking 3 days for transfers done from different bank (you call it one business day, but it is actually 3 calendar days when transfer happens on friday!). The banks claim we have already got the digital currency, but why it is taking so long for a simple transfer! This might be acceptable 10 years ago but not now!
Bitcoin is fast and easy to use. A little bit geeky at the moment but we think it'll find its way!
