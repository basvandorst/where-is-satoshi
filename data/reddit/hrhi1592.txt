@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:35

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:44

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:53
Joking bro
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:19:57
Same, Down 600$ from past few days (im 15yo) but still not selling doesn't matter what. i find it more fun tbh when theres dips too haha :D 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:48
i was joking man :D im not selling even if it goes to 1k :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:07
That dump on gdax rn hahaza
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:00:34
true, i wasnt smart by putting EVERYTHING at 14k ;D would be so fun to buy in this price rn
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:21
this isnt even close to being big :D ive seen a 1200 sell wall gets chewed up in 20mins
all depends on the buy powe
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:15
Diee dieeee dieeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:48:24
yea but then again bro, i dunno how it's with you but i just CANNOT get the thought out of my head, and its the worst feeling ever
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:49:04
maybe if i was 18 at that time i would be smarter =p
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:47:39
Fuck yea i did.. and that lesson was not pleasent to say the least :(
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:52:35
 i'm not a begger man.. that's one thing i can be proud of. this is my first ever post in this subreddit, didnt see any other threats before i posted this
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:42:33
True but like the feeling that i shoulda have close to 30-35k to my name right now is killing me, I KNOW its nothing to some ppl and ppl lost houses and millions, i know that people in africa don't have food etc (just saying things ppl told me along the way) but i don't have a house and i don't live in africa. im leaving in my own reality and this reality is fucked for along time due to that mistake :c
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:53:18
oh wow, well didnt notice but according to the context and my past thats a sick one ^^ ty man.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:50:23
Thanks for the answer, not trying to be mean but this is really easy to say man, i wasnt exaggerating in my title, it's literally eating me, say i get 150$ gift from my dad or something, i be like "Damn thats awesome but i shoulda have 40k rn so why would i even be happy", little money has barely any value for me anymore :(
u feel me ? 
ty again for the answer! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:55:54
Umm, ok :P does look like theres abit of dip but ive known bitcoin since it was 400$ so this dip doesnt really mean anything lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:33
cashing out to real life won't be a problem, i will get around 3.5-3.8k in cash depends how fast i wanna sell it. there is a site that u sell the items in, and then they pay u the money to paypal, and from there to bank.
thing is, i'm comfortable with it being in items cause i wouldn't have to explain parents etc how i got this money :P
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:27:35
i'm not using op if ima cash it to bitcoin. got ppl who will pay more than there
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:36
Not op, got my own ppl to sell to =]
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:38:11
insane, They are quiet a good team aswell lol
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:23:12

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:22:42
i mean im asking that cause i already tried in ceo.io, send them every single picture they asked for and still no reply for like 3days lol

@_date: 2017-09-04 20:40:59
Well that was quick and i feel like a retard for not thinking bout that :D

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:24:31

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:39:40

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:34:51

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:21:59
i won't ever bother trying to prove.. you are pathetic
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:47:03
is this a time to buy yet? doesn't look like a serious dip but still 500$ less than 2days ago
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:55:23

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:30:23
