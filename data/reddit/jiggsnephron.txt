Which claims? "Literally lies"? or "Seems to have bought"?
Literally lies? Impossible, because no lie was made, so that claim is not possible.
Seems to have been bought? The fact that it now promotes an altcoin as Bitcoin. It might be the original owner changing his views. It might be shilling/Ver. It seems like it's not the original owner.

I think you might be missing the word 'seems' in the title?

I see what you're saying. Rent paid until 2020 vs 2022 could be a big deal in many lives. 
But, again, it could be Jan 2022 vs August 2021. By keeping 1%. I don't see the rationality or risk aversion of selling 100%. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:04:10
The risk tolerance of selling everything, when you don't have any need for it right now (the several years thing is the crux of this. The context matters), is in the negatives. It's irrational. It's not sane or wise. Keep 0.05% even. Why sell 100% of anything you own (unless you know for sure it's going to lose it's value) when you have no need for even 10% of it today. There is no rationality here. This is not risk aversion. It's increased risk.

He never made the claim that he 'knew'. Why are people so extreme here. The argument is to keep some. Not all or nothing. And in fact, in this case, it's only "why not educate yourself before selling". 
Just don't sell 100%! Even if you hate btc, and don't believe in it at all, its unwise to sell 100% of something you dont need today. Just in case. The comments here are really weird. Why are people telling this person to sell everything, and calling people advising against that idiots and worthy of ignoring. Maybe it goes to 0. Maybe it goes to 20,000. Maybe it goes to 1,000,000. 5% of 'several years of rent' is worth the risk of any of those outcomes. 0% is stupid.

Never, ever, listen to 'bcash people'.
Don't worry, bitcoin is fine.

Or sell 90% of it? 50% of it?
If it gives him enough fiat to 'pay several years' of rent, then there is nothing rational about selling 100%.
If btc hits $1m, that 10% kept could be another 'several years' of rent. Several years of rent can be reduced to 'several years of rent -2 years'. If it turns to 0, he still got 'several years -2 years' of rent.
I hope, by then, those 2 years are sorted via other investments. No bitcoins, when the current holdings can cover you for 'several years' is not smart. I'd call it stupid.
The options here are "0 bitcoins, and x years of rent", vs "y bitcoins, and x-z years of rent". Only the latter is rational.
I'd understand if it was "I'm struggling, right now, to pay next month's rent. So I'm selling 100% to cover that, and the next few months". But this is 'several years' of rent. Within 'several years' one should be diversifying and making money in other ways too, which would offset the loss of the remaining btc crashing.

You're wilfully taking what he said to an extreme. It doesn't matter if its btc or anything else. It doesnt matter if we believe it goes to the moon or crashes. It is not rational to sell 100% of something that you have no need for today. If selling them all right now pays for 'several years' of rent, it makes no sense to take that gamble with 0 hedging. Keep 1%. Keep 0.05%. Keep 10%. But don't sell 100% when it sets you up for years. You have no NEED for it.
"Paying rent is reckless" is not a statement anyone worth arguing with makes. And "keeping it all in a speculative tech" is the opposite of the main thing repeated here which is "don't put more into it than you can lose". The 'all' in this context is btc he found behind the couch. Which is worth 'several years' of rent to him. Context.

It has? Do you have a blog I can subscribe to?

An argument. Good. I disagree though. That site is designed to trick people into preferring bch over bitcoin and uses the name 'bitcoin.com' to do so. It's a scam site confusing users to prefer a scam coin.

It was effectively before segwit. Segwit was barely part of the network at that time. Had it been where it is now, or will be by the end of the year, it'd have gone much better. Enormous amounts of transactions at that time were also proven to be spam in order to slow things down. Bitcoin has in no way been proved broken. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:21:24
It's a scam site. It is very fucking definitely a scam. The site promotes a shitty alt-coin as if it were bitcoin. That's a scam... 
You either know this and are trying to further the scam, or you're a moron. Replying all nicely with a demand for arguments is the typical way in which scammers trick noobs who come here unsure of who's right. bch is a scam. bitcoin.com is a scam site.

And Donald Trump is the President of the most powerful economy on earth. Shit happens.
Chris Brown still sells records in high numbers.
How used/popular something is is never an argument for or against it being good/bad/a scam. 
Define scam before we exchange any more comments. 
Here's mine (it also happens to be what the dictionary defines it as...)
a dishonest scheme; a fraud.
a swindle.
bitcoin.com promoting bch is a scam.

This has nothing to do with what I said.
Obviously it is relative. You have decided a) what enormous means and b) ignored the context, that it is within the btc transactions. At that time, an enormous amount (of the blockchain transactions) were spam in order to create the issues you are now referring to. Not "an enormous amount of global transactions happened on bitcoin". No idea how you got that from what I said. I never once mentioned Visa or global transaction volumes.
Segwit has and will have much of an effect.
If/when btc reached Visa levels of 'enourmous', LN will need to be there. We already know that.

I assume you mean the person I replied to. Agreed.
If you mean me, I did the literal opposite. Took his strawman, showed it's not relevant, and returned to the topic at hand; "bitcoin,com is a scam site".
@_date: 2018-08-02 10:31:59
it says btc.com. btc is bitcoin and bitcoin only. Associating it with a scam coin is a scam.
@_date: 2018-08-02 11:27:18
That isn't true, and if it was, it is now August 2018. It's also not relevant to what makes it a scam.
Do your research. bch is a scam coin. If you disagree after research, great. Enjoy your bch.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:19:23
So your wallet supports THE cryptocurrency that started it all and a scammy altcoin. 
Doesn't change that associating btc with bch is scammy. Whether you are doing it, or not, and whether you are doing it on purpose, or not, doesn't change that a scam is being promoted via the reputation of btc in those posters. Those posters are shit. And they should be vandalised and destroyed, just like any other false adverts or scams.
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:57:29
Yes. Mostly.


Not needed. But yeah, that is part of it. Not really the part that truly makes it a scam. That'd be the fraud/dishonesty/blatant propaganda across many channels online. 
I said earlier that you should define 'scam', as I believe you think it means 'make money in a bad way' (sorry if this assumption is wrong, it just seems that you require the argument to explain profit). Making a profit is not needed for a scam to be a scam. I can scam you into selling your home to someone else. I make no profit. Still a scam.

Before segwit and LN.
