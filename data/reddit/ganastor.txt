I just want to say thank you, until you mentioned it I had never heard of CJDNS or Hyperboria. I just read the whitepaper and am about to read it a 2nd time because I'm so enthralled.

Or something like this? Not horribly pretty but took me about 5 minutes to put together if you prefer something like this
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:03:39
You looking for just something like this?

Considering that my "expertise" lies in SQL / Windows servers support and development I highly doubt I can be of any help - but I am beyond intrigued. It's going in my pocket for the day that I ever get time to learn anything about Python or Java, it weren't for Bitcoin I likely would have never even looked at them.

Lol.. I know it wasn't pretty, was just trying to get a feel for what he wanted, both this and the other I just posted were 5 minutes projects to see what he's really looking for

Circle is free isn't it (I know fees built in and what not, but I think the volatility in price of bitcoin is more of an issue than 1%, that can be made back or lost 2x within seconds), I was more thinking of the educational opportunity for people

I don't know why more people don't realize this

By this logic all paper currency should be outlawed because they allow anonymous transactions.

Small edit, that article is from 2013, Google fixed it now. But agreed on everything well said
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:15:36
So not really obviously... but thought this was a great article to teach people how NOT to get ripped off using bitcoin
