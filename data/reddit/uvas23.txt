It took me a few days, and that was when btc was going crazy at its ATH. I used bank transfer (ACH i think) which allowed me instant buy. But Gemini will hold that buy until your deposit clears your bank which for me was one week. After that I was able to move my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:43:07
party pooper
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:36:46
Then you win.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:39:09
I think that is when you send a transaction to combine a bunch of small amounts at different addresses into one bigger amount on one address.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:24:32
Check this:
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:14:54
Wow, that was a large wall of nonsense. Thanks for sharing. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:59:49
So what will actually happen with the upcoming upgrade?
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:25:57
1) Do you know what inflation means? Bitcoin inflates every time a block is found. There are 12.5 more bitcoin every ten minutes. This amount will be halved in about 2 1/2 years, to 6.25 new bitcoin every ten minutes. Its inflation rate is halved every four years. This is the opposite of hyperinflation. In 2 1/2 years bitcoin's inflation will be the equivalent of gold's inflation. 4 years after that it will be half of gold's inflation rate. 12 years after that bitcoin's inflation rate will be .1% a year. So, in less than 20 years, bitcoin's inflation will be a negligible amount.
2) No it isn't - 
3) Slow change is a feature of bitcoin, not a bug.
4) Yea, we wil probably have highish fees for most of this coming year.
5) No. Its value comes from it being a currency and a payment network. People are speculating on how valuable this currency/network will end up being.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:02:53
The entire home computer industry is deflationary, it doesn't seem to  be hurting them none...
People will still buy things, but they will use more thought when using an increasing asset rather than a decreasing one.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:54:19
And that current transaction load will be reduced BECAUSE many, many transactions will be made off chain on the lightning network. All those low fee tx's sitting around in the mempool will vanish. Poof! Taken care of by the LN. And the fees on the Lightning Network are "unfairly cheap". People will flock to spending less than 1 penny per transaction.
People are certainly taking the high fees into consideration when preforming a transaction on bitcoin. Once LN rolls out, this won't be a consideration anymore. The fees will be much less than any alt coin charges.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:00:08
There has been a large increase in mining capacity in the last 24 hours, and the block are being confirmed way too fast right now. So the mempool is getting wiped out.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:11:59
Its stories like this that make me glad I switched to hardware wallet solution.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:16:37
So you get a 30% referral fee for every dollar spent by people who sign up under your link? Pretty sweet!
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:16:10
I got my nano a few months ago, and I am extremely happy with it.
Its the bee's knees!
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:41:14
Why is ripple at 120 billion!?!?!?!
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:07:19
Illinois will probably be one of the last to adopt...such a shit state.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:01:13
In Soviet coinbase, segwit uses you!
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:26:34
Nice! I hated looking at that shite every day.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:25:04
Do a little research on the Lightning Network. This is already on the main net. Once it grows and some user friendly wallets are made, bitcoin's fees will be "unfairly cheap". :-D
You can google "unfairly cheap" to see for yourself!  lolz
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:44:02
It's not all about price. Its just that there are so many new people that don't know very much about bitcoin, and what they do know is price. A few bearish months will give them time to research their investments.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:26:19
I think I will try opening my own Lightning Network node, just to decentralize the network a bit. :-D
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:37:23
Yea, I think the next 2-4 months are going to be good for people accumulating bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:06:15
Oops, I just checked it an hour later and 2 more nodes joined! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:56:51
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:13:01
Who would be exiting where with what?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:48:03
Ledger is for the cool people.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:23:29
thats 4 times the usual rate for 21% increase in blocks?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:36:33
16 billion in the last 24 hours is low volume?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:33:51
Done it. That was fun! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:11:23
Go here: 
Its on the github
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:28:59
Ok, I heard of that one...
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:05:17
And the cpi didn't move in the last 3 days. So bitcoin price change hasn't affected inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:57:15
Yes, you can talk about how the total amount of bitcoin is increasing. This is inflation.
You can also talk about the price of bitcoin. This is the price of bitcoin.
You keep interchanging these two things.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:36:02
No. I am not full of shit. Its decreasing rate of inflation is one of bitcoin's greatest selling points.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:10:03
An increase in the money supply IS a price decrease in the currency. This is why inflation changes prices. It is actually the value of currency going down due to its greater supply. Therefore, ALL prices increase. 
Bitcoin is not the currency of any nation that i am aware of. Currently, it acts like a commodity. Its price goes up and down due to market action and various news of the day. Nothing is priced in bitcoin, therefore, no prices are affected by bitcoin. 
Again, inflation is simply the increase in supply. It is not the price. And inflation is certainly not a price decrease of a commodity.
Yes, price changes in commodities affect their ability to buy things. But the change in price of bitcoin does not change the amount of bitcoin. Its very simple if you stop conflating price with supply.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:43:41
All good objections, and really the point of owning bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:35:13
No, you are confused. People are talking about monetary inflation when they speak of bitcoin's inflation rate. And when they talk about its price, they are talking about its price.
When they say bitcoin is deflationary, they mean that bitcoin will ever only have 21,000,000 coins. That's it. And in relation to all the other world currencies, it is very deflationary. Every other world currency will increase its supply until they are worthless. Already, its inflation rate is lower than the US dollar. So in that sense, bitcoin is deflationary. 
Dude, bitcoin crashing in price doesn't affect the economy in any serious way. The price of bitcoin fell from 20k to 12k and the price of milk was not affected in the least. Does it affect someone who is holding bitcoin? Sure. Did the price fall from 20k to 12k change the amount of bitcoin in circulation? No. So the price fall from 20k to 12k caused ZERO inflation.
The dollar or Euro fluctuates in price every day, that is not inflation. Inflation is when the total amount of dollars is increased, and that results in prices of everything to go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:51:46
no, what was it?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:12:23
And I see you cannot understand reason and the written word. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:40:53
Done...and holy shit! There are a lot of great reviews. I saw one shilling for bcash, and the rest were from real bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:00:45
Those are called fees. There are fees in LN, its just that they are tiny. Unfairly tiny! :-) Plus transactions are carried along the cheapest and fastest path. So If you set your fees too high, the network will avoid your channel.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:05:43
Yes, you only need to fund the channel to be as big as the payment size you want to send.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:43:58
1) it's decreasing inflation is a great advantage, possibly the best and most important aspect of bitcoin. Everyone who uses the network can be absolutely certain how many bitcoin there are. And you can now with precision how many bitcoin there will be ten or twenty years from now. No other currency (outside of cryptoland) can say that. This is the store of value of bitcoin, their value cannot be inflated away.
2) Its volatility is decreasing, and will continue to decrease as its adoption increases. It is easy to push around a 1 billion dollar currency, it is much harder to push around a 250 billion dollar currency, and will be harder still to push around a 3 trillion dollar currency.
3) There are several things in the works. Firstand foremost we need broad segwit adoption. Once core releases a segwit wallet this summer we will be on our way. Schnor signatures will help. Sidechains and other projects are in the works. It is a fascinating place to research.
4) When bitcoin reaches 100,000, many of the previous tech will have been rolled out.
5) Digital gold is its main attraction in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:02:53
I see. So we are just waiting for the GUI wallet to work with segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:24:29
Well, Gemini is back up and mempool is still falling along with fees.
Perhaps it is the large increase in mining power added in the last day which is making the block time decrease.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:53:11
No shit?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:47:21
I wasn't planning on selling for 3 years anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:20:31
Bitcoin is not used as a currency anywhere yet. When you see things priced in bitcoin in your local paper, then you can talk about inflation in terms of bitcoin. Until then, bitcoin is just another commodity, like wheat or steel. Inflation is not caused by price changes in wheat or steel.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:11:11
It doesn't have to reach a market cap of 15 trillion for John to have to eat his dick.

I was rich BEFORE I became my final form!
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:47:10
10k might be a good spot to buy
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:02:49
Holy crap! Mempool and fees falling like crazy. 
Shows segwit txs up to 20% of a block!
This shows txs clearing at 16 per second?!?!
WTF is going on?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:18:52
I heard their segwit upgrade will be by summer. That's gonna shoot up the percentage...
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:28:37
Tone Vays says we haven't retested $1300. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:00:19
Keep sending their help department messages that you want segwit now!
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:47:12
I never said it was production ready...
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:18:58
Yea, worldcoinindex.com did the same. The got rid of their  twitter feed. Man that was annoying. 
Just to let you know about the power that I personally wield, I sent them an email of complant the day before they took it down.  huh. huh?
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:03:56
I'm stealing this...it is gold, sir.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:09:38
According to this site: 
Hash rate up 21% in last 24 hours and blocks averaging about 7.5 minutes. Would this account for 16 txs clearing a second?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:22:10
Wow, that is a great resource. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:12:12
So, best day to sell is on Tuesday....good to know.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:08:44
yep, it has to finish downloading the whole block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:28:14
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:17:51
More of a grudging forebearance.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:38:49
Don't forget that most of the largest wallets are exchange wallets.
In theory, those bitcoin belong to millions of people, so bitcoin is a bit more distributed than at first glance.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:48:39
Yea, we will see if you keep saying that once you get overrun a little more with immigrants that suck up all your healthcare...
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:20:51
I'm tired of looking at that shite...
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:58:46
Its stuck in a channel. Be happy its hanging on to 10k, its fighting off a bearish trend right now.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:07:47
So just now waiting on a lightning wallet. Step by step it goes. You running out of time...
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:46:01
That happened to me. Restart and use the allow bridges option.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:57:25
Its a little bit jittery, but still up for me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:00:27
is that 11 bitcoin cents?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:59:26
What's wrong with your dollars? The supposed to be fungible.
Have you tried Gemini?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:51:51
Not in the least  lolz
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:29:25
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:59:49
You can check out a graphical representation of the LN: 
Watch it grow! :-) It had 43 nodes on Friday and is already up to 87 nodes. Unfairly cheap, here we come!
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:43:44
When you have to use more than one address to make a transaction, it takes up more block space, and therefore a higher fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:34:03
That is a sound argument.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:34:32
Seriously? This is what you got? 
You will be able to facilitate thousands of transactions with one channel opening transaction on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:12:51
Edit: crap ...
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:23:04
Don't you hate it when people use tor service for privacy? It automatically makes them drug dealers. /s

A bunch of people connected to Sleepyark because they are actually selling stuff. Everyone wants one of those stickers!
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:48:41
Well, it sure looks like you did.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:46:57
Oh, it is not my work. I just ran across those tutorials. I have no answer for you, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:42:45
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:23:58
It has uses. Its an international trustless payment system.  
If your friend won't look at a zoomed out graph and see what is in front of him, well, I don't know what to tell you.
Blockchain by itself is not that great, he is right. Satoshi brought together several different moving parts in a unique way to solve the double spend problem. There were many attempts before him, but all fell short. He invented the decentralized, trustless, open source, digital money/payment platform. And cryptography is an important part of the system.
His last statement is bizzare. Does he know that litecoin uses a blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:22:34
Done! Thanks for making it easy :-)

They list the exchanges they include. Just click on bitcoin and you can see volume in dollars and right under it in bitcoin. They have a markets tab which shows all the exchanges they include.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:07:28
Such wow! Much waiting!
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:32:39
I lost 17 marketshares of bitcoin due to an insecure wallet.

everyone has their own entry point...
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:01:43
That got you to sell? You must be new to bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:34:01
In Soviet America, the government indebts you!

I figured the smiley face would give me away

Ignorance came bundled with me when I was born. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:07:13
Its dropping because blocks are being confirmed way under ten minutes now. This is because of a large increase in mining capacity. We should be able to enjoy this for the next 3 1/2 days before next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:25:58
dang, those are like bch sized blocks!
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:08:55
Is this for the mainnet, or testnet?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:40:02
Ok, over a million bitcoins traded in the last 24 hours is low?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:10:01
Ah, ok. I was just so excited when I found it, and I wanted to share.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:25:25
That's testnet, not the mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:19:07
Bitcoin is not nothing. It is a service and a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:00:35
It has everything to due with the amount in circulation. Go learn some rudimentary economics.
"Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area). ... There is general agreement among economists that there is a causal relationship between monetary inflation and price inflation."
The price of bitcoin falling does not cause a general increase in price of goods. Bitcoin is not widely adopted. Things aren't priced in bitcoin. Things are priced in local currency, in my case the US dollar. And the price of a gallon of milk hasn't changed in 3 days.
If the price of bitcoin crashes, it means just that, its price crashed. It didn't suddenly hyper inflate, its inflation rate is a steady 12.5 coins per ten minutes.
If you look at the graph, you see bitcoin volatility goes up and down like a heartbeat, and the very end of the chart shows bitcoin vol starting back down again over the last few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:43
Bitcoin is a strange animal. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:34:16
This sounds like a really dumb idea.
Is there any issuance cap?
Backed by oil? How does that work?
Is it open source?
Dumb assed governments can't get anything right...
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:29:16
You should do a little research. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:20:40
He rick rolled the whole world!
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:19:22
Everyone who signs the petition should also send a message to coinbase support demanding segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:00:39
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:32:54
Yea, maybe it is not such a big factor. Very interesting stuff. I am curious to see what will happen to fees after next difficulty adjustment. If the fees don't spike, something is happening!
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:26:45
Yea, for awhile they were being confirmed at like 7.5 minutes each instead of the usual 10 minutes per block.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:40:34
I would think that coinbase's transactions are much more balanced than a mining pool. I would guess inputs roughly equal outputs. Money is flying IN and out. So segwit could make a pretty good dent on congestion.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:43:37
Inflation is cause by an increase in the money supply. This in turn raises the price of all goods, including wheat and steel. But prices of individual items such as steel are affected by market pressures. So individually, goods fluctuate in price. When they ALL rise, this is inflation.
And you come here saying that a price decrease is inflation. How dumb is that?
Good luck with you conflation of things.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:13:06
I certainly trust that... /s
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:16:40
This is for testnet only.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:48:00
Well, the last two times we had a greater than 45% correction, but less than 60%, it took 2 months for one, and 6 months for the other to recover. So probably we are in store for something similar.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:16:30
Well, I am one of those people, and I spend less money for an incredible increase in computing power.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:26:11
I loved that movie. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:38:18
Ok, you should do a little research, sir!
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:29:29
It's going to get worse, before it gets better.

Welcome to the winners circle.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:55:34
Innovation everywhere. I am getting really excited about LN!
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:37:20
Yes, clear out some of that blockage, and you will be able to understand.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:48:36
Banks suck! Am I right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:59:47
You can adjust the range so it fits prolly
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:49:59
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:23:49
Yes, there are ways to short bitcoin. Dive in buddy, we need some easy money. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:02:50
The miners. They get paid the transaction fees you know. Several percent of the block reward is already fees. On the congested days, the fees go up to 10-20% of the mining reward already.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:58:17
looks like it took a dive already to below 2000
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:12:25
Yes, I am capable of reading.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:07:39
It looks like bch will be grabbing more and more transactions. This will break the stranglehold that bitmain miners have on fees. There is more than one way to skin a cat. Eventually, some kind of balance will be reached and then we will coast along until Lightning Network is released. Then all bets are off.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:56:05
See how it works? The bubble of fiat currency will burst from the prick of the bitcoin pin. The fiat bubble is ripe for bursting. And bitcoin is the non trivial event that will come in contact with the fiat bubble.We are already seeing a stampede of wealth transfer. 
It is a simple meme to get across an idea. Its not stupid, and we are not dumbfucks.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:28:03
You can bet either way, but there must be one short position for each long position, so yea like 1400 open contracts, so 1400 losers.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:58:47
Well, that is pretty much how they value the stock market. They take the number of shares and multiply it by the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:30:39
Start using segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:53:01
Thanks for letting me disagree. You foolishly stated that bitcoin is a zero sum game. And I disagreed with your assertion. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:07:46
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:12:25
Wow! can I ask where you got that info on average tx size? Oops you posted the link, I didn't even see that cause I was so excited  lolz

Of course segwit will not solve everything. It is a preliminary step. There are just too many band wagon jumpers for the network to handle.

Agreed, bigger blocks aren't harder to mine. It is all about how difficult the problem is to win the coinbase. The low fees of bch lowers the prize for mining a block, so less of a prize means less competition (hash power). Less hash power means block difficulty will stay low. So less work needed to win a block.

Satoshi thought it would turn out to be a collectible or commodity. And as a commodity, it is mirroring gold. Take the monetized amount of gold, 75,000 tons, divide it by 16700000 bitcoins and multiply by 11% of the marketcap of gold (current value of bitocoin marketcap) and you arrive at the price of $19,800 a coin. If you take total suppy of gold:165000 tons, bitcoin is undervalued by 55%.

No, it is not worth moving it to an exchange! Say you have 25 dollars of bitcoin on your wallet right now. Moving it would cost you 22 dollars , leaving you 3 dollars to buy ETh. That 3 dollars worth of ETH would have to rise 8 times for you just to break even. Meaning the price of ETH would have to go to over  $6000 for you just to break even. Way better to hold on to the bitcoin, which will probably go up anyway.

The banking secrecy act requires banks to report any deposit of $10,000 or more. But since criminals are also aware of this law, banks are required to report any suspicious deposits UNDER $10,000. How they determine suspicious is anyone's guess.
I think anyone who has deposited less than $10,000 in a calendar year should be safe from this kind of reporting.

It was only a few cents at the beginning of the year, but now because of so many people piling into bitcoin, the fees have skyrocketed, something over 20 dollars now. :( . I don't see the fees coming down much in the coming months until bitcoin devs release a very important update called Lightning Network.  This promises to reduce fees back to near zero. But nobody can say for sure when this will be. It has been tested on the network and works, so we must all sit tight and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:05:56
Proof of stake is much less secure. Also, the currency will just be an inflationary transfer from non stake holders to stake holders. The value of bitcoin comes from the cost to create the database. A Proof of stake coin has little costs, and would have no real value in its database, therefore no real value.

The fees of bitcoin are high lately 20+ dollars, so most of the amount you have on your wallet will be eaten by that fee. My suggestion is to not worry about moving it for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:02:58
Well it is the same for stocks. Each share is valued at the price someone is willing to pay for it at that moment, as you said viewing the perceived value of the company(profit, forward looking stuff, etc.)
It is the same for a crypto, each coin is valued by the buyer at that moment, taking into consideration the various values of the service, network, etc.
The best valuation tool for bitcoin so far has been by tracking its network effect (amount of wallets, average amount of transactions per wallet, etc.). So there are tangible ways to value a blockchain. of course it is a very young market with a new asset class, so lots of room to improve valuations.

Bitcoin is a service. Its value comes from it being a decentralized service that has zero counter party risk. Its dollar value can be fairly reliably tracked by its network value.

The money is created out of thin air. 
You deposit money, say 1 million dollars. Now the bank can loan out 10 million dollars, having satisfied the 10% reserve requirement of 1 million dollars for 10 million in loans.

Every commercial bank has the ability to create new money in the form of checkbook money. So they are loaning you new money they created by making an entry in their computers. 
This is why banks want a 10-15% down payment on a house. The banks receive this down payment, which allows them to loan you the 90% by creating it out of thin air. This is the 10% reserve you hear about. A bank must hold 10% (or whatever amount) of money against the amount loaned out. So when you deposit that 20,000 downpayment, the bank is allowed to enter a 200,000 credit into your account as a loan which is used to buy the house.
Fun, huh?

I think arbitrage as one normally thinks of it is out the door with bitcoin because of the time it takes to move bitcoin from one exchange to another compared to bitcoins rapid price changes. What we see is probably more like: all the big players have accounts with all major exchanges. When they want to sell they go to the one with the highest price, when they want to buy they go to the exchange with the lowest price. Which keeps the prices relatively even.

Rodger won't succeed in his plan of becoming the "real bitcoin". The fork may survive, but that remains to be seen. He has just fired his last bullet with coinbase releasing bcash. It is having less effect than his segwit 2x attack. Bcash only got to .25 this time as compared to .4 with segwit 2x. Going forward his spam attacks on difficulty days will have little to no effect without big news item to support. And I don't see any more news items on the horizion.

If bitcoin does well, the difficulty for mining bitcoin goes up, and you get less and less coins from mining.

This is what happens with every single investment. Why is it bad only with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:40:11
I think devs are using it as a testnet for bigger blocks data, like they used litecoin for segwit testing.

@_date: 2017-12-30 03:34:05
If it is a small amount yea. Just realize that leaving your bitcoin on coinbase can be risky. Exchanges have closed before, and people were out of luck. I guess the first thing you should investigate are good wallets. Get one that uses segwit addresses, you will be helping out the network if you do.

Sure, small bits is ok. That's how I did it. While I accumulate, I spend time learning about bitcoin. I suggest watching Andreas Antonopoulos youtube channel. He is excellent source of knowledge. I have spent months researching and feel like I have only scratched the surface.
After awhile you start to feel much more comfortable with bitcoin. That's maybe when you could think about making big moves.
@_date: 2018-09-16 00:34:02
So? It is growing in a decentralized way. This is how decentralized happens. First it is very small and with few people, then more people join, then more people join, and so on. It is bigger than it was last month and smaller than it will be next month.

With the stress test, the other chain was shown to maybe handle 2-3 times as much traffic right now. They have a pretty big bottleneck in the mempool. They could maybe consistently fill 2-3 mb blocks. When they went for the big blocks, it took a long time for the mempool to fill them. I think their record block took over an hour to fill.
They only managed to reach 35% of their target of 5 million txs in 24 hours. That is a fairly big fail.

If you are in the US, yes, each is a taxable event. Now this is not tax advice, but I suppose you could cost average your bitcoin purchase price and apply that to each sale of bitcoin, and presto, you get profit per purchase.

Wages rise, but in response to inflated currency. And that new money has already been spent. The value of the things that the newly printed money buys is taken from the value of money that people have saved over their lifetime. So people's savings are literally being taxed every year by the new money being spent into the economy.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:33:19

He is not using a slippery slope argument, he argued how big the blocks must be to get us back to nearly free transactions. And then he compares that to our growing rate of adoption and using that, predicts how big our future blocks must be.

Well, in today's dollars, WWI cost 330 billion or so. WWII cost about 4 trillion. Afghanistan cost us 2.4 trillion so far...and its scale is tiny compared to the world wars.
Those earlier empires were not grown with a gold standard, but by absolutist state controlled systems. The kind that do not work under a gold standard.
Interestingly, WWI was the last US war to be paid for by war bonds. People took out their savings, and gave it to the government by buying war bonds. This was the money used to persecute the war. When war got expensive back then, people stopped giving and governments had to wrap up the war. That's why wars back then had limited objectives and small territorial changes. With the advent of fiat, wars can be fought to absolute destruction and long durations regardless of what the people want. Jus make the debt a little bigger and fight on for another year.

There is a thing called diminishing returns. There will be a point when it will not be worth it for someone to add hashing power. It could be tomorrow, it could be 20 years from now. Nobody knows, not even you. That would flatten the hashrate. And if an extended bear market happens after that, the hashrate could very easily go down.
Or to put it another way, hashrate won't ever go down, until it does. You know, like how the price of housing never went down, until it did.
9 years is not so long for you to be so arrogant about it.

The fact is that historically, the average block is mined in less than 10 minutes. I think the average for the last 6 months is 9.2 minutes. That is why this site has a different halving day, because it uses the historical time per block, rather than the theoretical.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:12:20
Well, not much happened during the last halvening. Everyone knew it was coming. There is zero surprise about it. It was the mania and rapidly growing interest in bitcoin that drove the price to 20k. Of course, the halvening is a very bullish event for bitcoin long term. But we already know when it is coming to within a week. So it will be a non-event. Investors have plenty of time and exact knowledge about it and will position themselves accordingly far in advance. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:37:00

So, leveraged up the ass financial instruments allow you to predict inflation rate 5 years out? Sounds legit. Where you able to predict the housing crash and subsequent 1-2 trillion of new money pumped into the economy five years before it happened?

Nice random guess. We both know what bitcoin's inflation will be in five years, so no need to ask :-)

First, some governments already accept bitcoin in payment of taxes. 
Second, the supply of bitcoin is known by everyone. It needs no central authority. There is nothing inherently wrong with deflation. As the economy grows, the value of bitcoin will grow. So by the most basic economic understanding, bitcoin will be the best and safest way to store value.
Thirdly, inflation is becoming less and less predictable. You can look at many graph showing various aspects of the US money supply for example, and watch the lines jump around all over the place with no one able to predict what is going to happen in the next 5 years. Now look at the smooth graph of bitcoin creation. This won't change...ever. It is much easier to make money calculations with known quantities, than with unknown quantities.

@_date: 2018-05-01 09:07:57
So it will be the higher demand and adoption that will drive the prices. The halvening is a non-event. Everyone knows it is coming, there is exactly zero surprise about it. Now don't get me wrong, it is a very positive event and long term benefit to everyone holding bitcoin. But it is already being baked into the price. Other more unexpected and surprising announcements about bitcoin will affect price more.

if you take away the currency from any of the cryptos, they won't function. Blockchain is just one component that makes up a cryptocurrency. Blockchain by itself is just a type of ledger that had been around for a long time. Blockchain principles by themselves are just a database.

I read that Switzerland is accepting bitcoin for government services. 
But yea, maybe I misspoke there. 
There will never come a day when the US will accept anything but Fed notes for payment in taxes. But a money doesn't get its value from needing to pay taxes with it. Only fiat currency needs this, as otherwise it is worthless. Real moneys arise in the free marketplace.

I am not misusing the word inflation. When a money supply is inflated, it gets bigger. Derp.
Yes, I said the price of a meal would drop from 4 crypto to 1 crypto. Oh, the horror of paying less for things as you get old!
What you keynesian idiots don't understand is that it takes savings to create the capital that is then borrowed. People don't "hoard" their savings, they put them to work in investments.
Pushing the interest rate to artificially low rates mimics a large amount of savings, except there is no actual capital, just borrowed funds. And the house of cards will collapse as it always will, as in 2008.

The supply of bitcoin effectively remains the same. 17 million bitcoin before the swap, 17 million after the swap. People are right now exchanging litecoin for bitcoin. And yet, the amount of bitcoin isn't *effectively* being increased at all. Atomic swap just makes the exchange faster and trustless. The only way to effectively increase the bitcoin supply is to mine a block.

There are many coins that are cheaper and faster than bitcoin. This doesn't seem to be affecting bitcoin much. Now you give bitcoin holders an easier and faster way to exchange their bitcoin for the faster and cheaper coin. That is not a bad thing, that is a good thing for bitcoin holders. It is also a good thing for the altcoin holders. They can quickly exchange their coins for bitcoin.
I don't see the problem.

There are about  636,250 coins to mine until the next halfening. That will leave 2,625,000 coins left to mine after next year. In the 4 years after the next halfening, 1,312,500 coins will be mined, leaving 1,312,500 coins to mine after 2024. Half will be left after 2028: 656,250 coins. 4 year later, 2032, only half of those will be left to mine: or 328,125 coins left to mine. So The guy was pretty close.

There is a small but growing network of companies that use the network commercially. Check it out here:

It is not a long stretch by any means. It is straightforward enough. 51% of a large amount of hashing power is much harder to achieve than 51% of a small amount of hashing power. It also costs more, making a 51% attack much much less likely.

Bitcoin is improving its throughput by gradual degrees. Even now, the network can handle quite a bit more txs with the increase in segwit adoption and increased batching than it could last December. LN is starting to expand rapidly now that it is out of alpha. No one has any idea how much tx pressure the LN will relieve. It is impossible to know how many txs are being made through the LN network right now.
There are more improvements in the pipeline such as schnorr sigs. These will possibly increase capabilities by another 30%. 
As time goes by, each percentage improvement added will increase tx limit by larger and larger amounts. A 30% increase of 3 tx per second will give 1 additional tx per second. A 30% increase of 9 tx per second will give 3 additional tx per second.
So, projecting this outward, in a few years a new improvement that increases efficiency by a few percent will give an increase far more than what the total network can handle right now.
These things take time. There is not going to be a quick fix to the tx limit problem. But it will improve at an ever increasing rate.

The huge spike to 20k was ill timed. A LOT of pumping for a network that was not ready for mass adoption. We were able to see the system work at overloaded levels. And we saw that it worked as intended. Fees spiked to compensate. People stopped transacting because of high fees which killed the hype. Prices plummeted. A LOT of people got burned by the price action and pulled out of the space. Transactions reduced to where we were at in 2016. No more pump, no more heavy transactions load. We are going to meander around these prices for a few months I would guess. Time is needed for investors to heal their wounds, and for a new army of investors to congregate.

But now seeing what happened to the state of bitcoin as it got swamped, I see that Andreas was right once again. That guy is all kinds of smart!
I think the network can already handle much more traffic with segwit and batching. Lightning is just around the corner now that it is beta. I think people will be shocked at how much better bitcoin is going to be the next runup!

Yes, the fraud committed by random banks was turned into centralized fraud that we now have with the fed. Such a great leap forward. 
What if I told you that you don't need to continually inflate the money supply? Inflation is the result of the Fed. Print more money, it becomes less valuable. Its not rocket science.
 Friedman was correct that the gold standard would limit the Fed's power. Here is a thought: what if instead letting banks destroy our money, we instead throw the people who commit the fraud of fractional banking in prison? Give a few of those fuckers a 20 year prison term, and the rest will straighten their act.

No, I am saying the work done by the mining community helps secure the blockchain.
The cost I mentioned in my previous post pertains to the cost of a 51% attack. The more hash power needed to do it, raises the cost. There is a point where it makes more economic sense just to mine the coin.

I read somewhere that the LN breaks up each satoshi into 1000 parts so the fees can be ridiculously small.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:55:18
I just now checked my ledger. I can send 12 cents of bitcoin (a bit over a thousand) for 16 cents fee at 2 sat/byte. The mempool is confirming 1 sat/byte, but it may take a little bit to confirm. 2 sat/byte should get you in the next block right now.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:38:37
You misunderstand how the fee structure works. You choose the fee you pay. The miners simply aggregate blocks with the highest fees. The miners don't offer blowjobs (sadly). If you want your tx  confirmed faster, you pay more fees. Miners generally take txs with the highest fees to increase their income. When the network got seriously over taxed in december, the fees you needed to pay to get confirmation skyrocketed. Fixes are being implemented as we speak. Already, the network can handle more txs.
But I fear we have some months before we will get people interested again to test out how much more the network can handle.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:13:45

Only in banking is this not a crime. Those crazy bankers..eh?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:22:59
Just imagine how fast and cheap bitcoin would be if they only had the tx that bcash has....
There was a spike in tx's for bitcoin probably because of massive pumping for the futures release. Now that the hype is over, we can get back to the business of expanding the network's capabilities. I wouldn't expect the tx levels to stay this low for long.

You should round out you education a bit. You not knowing that fractional reserve banking has been around as long as there have been banks is a telling point.
The fed has destroyed the value of the dollar. In 1900, you could buy an ounce of gold with 19 dollars. Today you need 1350 dollars to buy that same ounce.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:52:30
I thought we were talking about when we were on a fractional reserve, not the current fiat system. The current system can inflate money at will. 
That mere 2% a year inflation will destroy 90%+ of the value of money over 50 years. But on the plus side, if you are the entity doing the inflating, you don't give a shit what it is worth because you can always create more.

No, the purpose of mining is to provide security for the blockchain by use of proof of work. The greater the effort to find a block means the greater the effort needed to change the blockchain. Miners don't decide to mine a block every ten minutes. The difficulty is simply adjusted to reflect current mining power on the network. The miners have no choice but to mine blocks at a ten minute average.

Yea, I check the LN's metrics most days just for fun. 
One thing that is great is the list of businesses that use LN is steadily growing. Last time I checked there are 46 businesses on that list now. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:40:29
Doesn't matter, they run the money press. They get your tax money. They don't care about ratings. Just like CNN doesn't care about ratings or fake news they pump. They get their money from basic cable subscriptions, they don't give a fuck if you even watch.

So not only do we have falling prices, we have innovations. Just horrible!
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:00:43
It is some work to upgrade. It is simply a matter of wallets understanding that it is their own best financial interest to do so.
There are also some that are backers of an alt coin. And by refusing to upgrade, they feel they are helping their alt coin.
So it is a bit of both.

I would be like yikes! at every power burp. My electric fades a bit every once in awhile and sometimes restarts my computers. 
I would probably invest in a extra power source if I had 50+k in lightning channels....

Its up to 74% now :-)
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:41:41
we will see in his final part of his review. I certainly think he was hoping for something to go wrong by shutting down all at once.
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:25:05
You could just go ahead and try it with default settings. I am planning to open one soon. Should be a learning experience. :-)
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:09:35
it looks just like my logarithmic chart...
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:23:24
Yes, I am very curious about what he has planned. My guess is that he is just going to shut them all down at once and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:52:43
Fractional lending far predates the Fed. Look at all the bank runs in the 1800's. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:21:03
Why not, they have lost serious amounts of money. Hundreds of billions, that is pretty serious. Investors losing several hundred billion dollars is slightly different than 2014 when a few billion was lost. All because they bought into the hype when bitcoin was obviously not ready for mainstream. They will be writing off anything they think is hype for quite some time.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:26:26
This postulated downward pressure didn't materialize for the previous halvenings.
And a reduction in supply provides UPWARD price pressure, not downward.
So, I am gently calling this fud.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:01:15
not from robinhood
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:42:23
lol, indeed
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:04:21
The LN network divides a satoshi into 1000 parts for its bookkeeping. So you can do a lot of little fees and when you close your channel it get rounded to the nearest satoshi. 
Don't worry, a satoshi is still a satoshi :-)
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:58:10
Now that you can make tiny tx's on Lightning, I noticed that the bcash trolls have shifted from bitcoin can't make small transactions... like for a coffee...to Lightning can't send BIG transactions  lol.
There is just no pleasing some people :-D
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:09:36
Ah, that's right. He wasn't using his own equipment.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:25:04
My antivirus blocked a coin miner when I clicked on this link.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:41:13
If you run a Lightning node, you can charge fees to whoever routes through your node. Its not a lot of money. Lightning breaks satoshis into a thousand pieces, so fees are really small.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:53:45
So again, looking a graphs of hash rate and price, you can easily see that hashrate does not have a negative effect on price. One could very easily say the opposite.
But as we both know, correlation does not mean causation.
So seeing that there is no correlation and no causation, I will gently remind that claiming so is simply fud. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:17:08

@_date: 2018-07-27 12:33:51
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:25:59
Possibly. But it may be more likely that it is because the hashrate hasn't moved much this past month.
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:20:43
Yep, looks like he shut it down.

@_date: 2018-07-22 09:46:41
This is how decentralized works. It has to start at zero and grow. The network is steadily growing and seems to be growing faster now. Last week, 22 new businesses added LN payments. Each individual has to decide to learn how to use it in their business and adopt it.
Everyone doesn't just jump on in one day.
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:26:09
ah cool. I wasn't sure about that.
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:45:38
So what is the difference this time around?
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:36:19
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:22:21
You can open channels to send btc through the LN. You use an amount of bitcoin to do that. So, this one guy has opened channels with a total amount that equal 35 bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:56:01
You are correct sir. I worded my reply incorrectly. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:50:47

New systems come into operation when the older generation dies off. When I was young, I knew people who would use nothing but cash in transactions. They were old and there was no way to change their mind. 
I think it will be the same with crypto, most older people don't get it or trust it, so they will go to their graves without using it.
@_date: 2018-07-16 08:56:09

We will get back there pretty quick. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:37:46
Well, if the miners are already paid for, and they can mine more than the cost of electric, why not plug them in?
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:57:00
yes I misspoke it is not hardcoded
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:11:27
I agree that hash rates and prices are not correlated. You may have noticed that I said that in my last post.
And I also agree that reduced mining rewards produce an upward pressure on prices.
So, taking these facts, I would gently remind that anyone postulating downward pressure because of these facts is probably fud.
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:19:02
Big, if true.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:40:05
I don't know about Binance, but Gemini still doesn't.
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:01:05
So, again. 
Tx's valued in BTC are as low as they were in 2014. The last quarter of 2014, sure. But the last quarter of 2014 is in 2014. 
Not sure what is paranoid about that, but, whatever.
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:40:04
I am not comparing busiest days. In 2014 the amount of btc per day being traded steadily increased. And there is a point on that rising graph, where the btc traded then was higher than it is now. And it continued on to be higher the farther along you go. 
2014 starts the year lower than now, and ends the year higher than now. See? Not that hard.
 BTC are now being traded much less often at a much lower price than late last year. This 7 month trend trend has yet to be broken. So yea, not good.
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:25:43
Overall volume is pretty low. Maybe even scary low. :-( We ain't out of this yet.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:09:16
grrr...I downloaded the eclair wallet, but all it has is testnet folder. I went here:  and downloaded the top .exe. When I install, just testnet. :-(

All they have is a waiting list with no expected ship date for their miner. :-(

I am not sure what the time limit is, but I do think they are time limited.
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:49:28
So are you finished with your testing of the LN?
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:48:49
You can use the Eclair wallet. You can't receive with it yet, but you can make payments via Lightning without needing to have your own node. You can even use it with your smartphone. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:41:03
I think I read on the Bakkt site that you have to put down 3500 per contract.
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:29:53
He has channels open right now that are worth 35 btc. So he has used 35 btc in opening  the channels he currently has open. How much he has sent is unknown. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:43:23
ah I see.
if you take a graph of price since 2010 and take a graph of hashrate since 2010 and compare them, you will see that hashrate and price seem to follow a similar trajectory. So the downward pressure you postulate is nowhere to be seen.
So I will again gently remind that this is fud.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:59:44
This wallet is un-dick-suckable!
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:20:40
I just did. You end your post stating that reduced mining rewards puts a downward pressure on prices, which is the opposite of what I am saying.
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:20:50
It is, he actually shut off his website, took off all his anti btc sentiment and ads for Ver's sites, then restarted it so his review of Lightning would appear "neutral".
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:31:40
+1 for you, sir.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:33:03
Hey Mikey! He likes it!
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:02:51
Ln channels have a hard limit for beta. I think the biggest you can have is .04 btc. I may be wrong about the amount.
@_date: 2018-07-16 08:55:49
Ha! That is right. I didn't notice the settings on that graph.
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:41:09
You could dump the bottom 1000 alt coins and the marketcap would reduce less than 1 billion. Just a bunch of garbage down there.
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:34:52
Silk road 1.0 was shut down in 2013, 2.0 in 2014, and 3.0 in July 2017. So your correlation is not apparent to me.
 This decrease in volume has happened concurrently with the current price crash this year. And its really bad. Tx's valued in btc are as low as they were in 2014.
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:44:57
it's possible, but you won't make much money. As a futures contract gets closer to settlement date, it's price gets closer to actual bitcoin price. So on the day before expiry, there is very little difference, if any.

And such, it is getting stronger every day. :-)
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:55:59
So, we basically agree.
I think we will pull out of this dive, but it is a matter of when. This could easily continue for quite a few more months into much lower prices since the patterns are being created on a larger and longer scale than it ever has before.
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:51:27
As a bcash backer, if he could somehow crash or reduce people's trust in the Lightning Network, that would be a plus for his side.

Do you know something we don't know?
Spill the beans!!  :-D
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:06:01
The capacity of the Lightning Network refers to the total amount of bitcoin that is currently being used to maintain channels. Each channel holds a little bit of bitcoin, so capacity is the just all the open channel amounts added up.

@_date: 2018-07-27 10:23:11
I agree somewhat. He tested its ability to scale up, that's for sure. But he also upped his fees to a hundred times higher than anyone else then complained no one wanted to connect with him.

Here is a fun site that shows recent blocks and time. It also shows transactions and tx per second, size of blocks by kb and dollar value. It also has a great little chart in the bottom left that you can see fees and size and other stuff:
It also has a nice sat/byte amount under the current mempool, so a pretty good fee estimator.

So? It is interesting that you can jump from "the gold standard" to "versions of a gold standard." If the certificates were 100% backed by gold, then we are still operating under the gold standard. At whatever point they are no longer 100% backed by gold, then you have left the gold standard.

@_date: 2018-12-18 11:54:23
well, we are on a much better position right now. We can handle a lot more txs. Probably enough to handle what became a backlog last December. With batching and segwit we should be fine until Lightning grows more useful. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:35:39

Nonsense, the mempool was starting to clear. It would be on any of those blocks. Its just a matter of chance on which block.

It means that the reward for finding a block will be cut in half from 12.5 btc to 6.25 btc.

That is not proof of Tone cheating. The block that included Tone's tx was many hours after the bet.  Low fee txs get included into blocks all the time.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:38:32
Yep, that is what I have been using for the last 6 months. I like it too. Since I don't trade and just hodl, I am looking into Bisq next. It has low volume, but I only buy once a month so who cares, right?
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:41:45
What makes a block harder to mine is the total amount of computers mining. 
As to price, there have been many discussions on what causes it to go up and down. This is what makes bitcoin fascinating to me. Some say price follows computing power, some say the other way around. Some say the scarcity drives price. Probably some weird combination of factors. But cutting the supply of new bitcoins lowers supply which in a normal market causes prices to rise as long as demand remains about the same.
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:39:23
rising you say?

transactions are nearly instant. there is no waiting for a block. there are no blocks. 
right now, there are 4700 lightning nodes and growing very fast. In a month there will probably be another 600-800 more nodes.
with lightning we will be able to directly and trustlessly exchange one coin for another like btc for ltc.

More gold is mined every year.
The total amount of gold supply doubled in the last 50 years. Bitcoin will only increase 15% or so in 50 years.
80% of all gold above ground has been mined after 1900. 82% of all possible bitcoin has already been mined.
There is no comparison.
