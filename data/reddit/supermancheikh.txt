Man, maybe it's better to invest in something you CAN control.

I do think that the more altcoins there are, the less value Bitcoin is gonna have.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:56:21
My solution is quite simple, all altcoins should go away and die.
Just imagine if there was only ☝️ crypo (BTC) or maybe just a few like 3 for instance, I bet the price would be much much higher because of the attention and big interest it would have.

Exactly your own business. ��

Well, it seems like this matter is still not solved. I'm actually looking for some ways too..
To buy Coins I used [Virwox.com]( and then exported them to my coinbase wallet. I sure know that Skrill would let you import BTC and BTC Cash in USD in any other currencies you choose to create your account with. But to have them on paypal, you still need to use sites that offer the service.
Now the big problem is **WHICH SITES TO TRUST??**

Not just BTC, this seems to affect all cryptos.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:05:54
They might be from the same company though. And they don't offer the same purpose.
Anyway I don't seem to find other scam reports on the internet a part from this one. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:07:43
Lol. Yeah, you get used to these things quite rapidly.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:10:33
Gotta say it makes some sense. Not enough though.
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:05:53
What do you guys think of coinpal.eu to buy/sell bitcoins with PayPal? Anyone has ever tried?
Since I don't live in the US nor EU, coinbase does have some restrictions to buy even sell from where I am.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:45:16
100% can see you mean. Quite true. ��
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:29:36
I think it's just crucial to have an investment that you can control then invest money you're kind of ready to lose in cryptos or anything else that you basically have less control over.

The only report I seem to find about this site is yours. But I do find Youtube videos saying it's quite reliable.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:38:08
What's Kraken? Can I buy/sell btc with Paypal that way?
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:17:22
Let's be honest **Anything Is Possible** to me at this time.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:07:57
This doesn't look good at all. ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:12:04
Alright man. Thanks so much for letting me know.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:37:02
No PayPal options?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:57:55
Wow... I've long thought about getting rid of my coins but witnessing today made me optimistic than ever.
Just speaking for myself. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
