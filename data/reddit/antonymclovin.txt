Private “blockchains“ are not needed in most situations. In a closed environment where everybody trusts each other you dont need (slow/decentralized) consensus mechanisms at all. Everybody accepts database entries from each other so its a normal database with everybody having access to write. If kind of this is what you are dealing with, communicate it and build something efficient, which probably also will shorten process time and reduce costs. If you only need “blockchain“ because of build-in smart-contracts, use it as a prototype or maybe use either rpa or something else. Best case you can digitize processes with better technology suited for that purpose. Only because some mainframes are from the 70s and eiher slow af or not customizable (or both) does not mean that Blockchain is the best solution to every problem.

You name it: How does a permissioned blockchain ensure that the uploaded information by other parties is true. I think that we dont solved that problem yet. A sealed gps tracker could be an accurate control system but maybe it too expensive for tea and too complex. I dont know how ingrediants of the tea are shipped. 
Maybe someone else has an idea for that problem.

Look at page 36 and 37. Explains all you need to know. Just a bunch of banks and central banks with their own agenda.

The USA has a stable dollar in comparison. We kind of saw what happened when the USA forbid gold in 1933. If crazy shit happens, governments do what they think is best for them, not the people. Yes, this could also happen with bitcoin. Let’s see what the future brings.

So you are comparing Mexico with Venezuela now?
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:43:37
In which world would the goverment allow their people to use foreign currencies? If that would be the case what would be the meaning of inflating their currency in the first place? 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:09:07
Yeah I understand that but Mexico does not have hyperinflation of 1.000.000% and is also very open in comparison with Venezuela.

You can live in your bubble as long as you want to. If you dont get it, I have not the time to convince you. Read a book once in a while. 
Start with Brzezinski and maybe have some research about the FED and after that about Bretton Woods and Nixon shock.

The USA with their petro dollar aka army dollar (every country, which tries to trade oil with other currencies than dollar gets a visit from US army) will attack every country which tries to lower the power of the dollar by bypassing the not written law of trading oil only with dollar. This has nothing to do with venezuela. Even sadam hussein was assasinated  by the USA after trying to trade oil with euro. If you are not China, don‘t try to piss them off. The USA is the empire trying to maintmain their power, period! 
Everybody who does research of fiat money knows that! This is called geopolitics.
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:19:18
It will be a central bank from a country, which will try to avoid sanctions from USA probably. My guess is Russia.

I dont mean it as an insult. I can understand people not going deeper into that because then they would understand how corrupt our system as a whole is. More and more people getting aware of all this and as a consequence Bitcoin was born. If you are not comfortable breaking out of this Matrix, it‘s up to you. Then we should stop our conversation.  If more informations are appreciated I can give good book recommendations.

He is toxic. He is a beginner when it comes to trading and he always mixes short term trading with long term investing/speculation. He has no knowledge in Information Technology but constantly talks about coins which are technologically bad.  He also had a huge fight with another german youtuber who is more the IT guy and Sunny constantly talked behind the other youtubers back and did some shady moves. Sunny is a child and nothing more.
He lost the fight and most of the community hated him so he deleted his german youtube account btw.

I never made a deep dive into that topic. You find things like that in the internet: 
Dont know if this is fake news or well investigated.

I dont know if there is a change coming to this but there should be a solution to provide bitcoin as liquidity without the need of worrying about disconnects and losing funds. I think there should be defi systems in place similar to tezos bakers and delegation being used for their consensus, not watchtowers

I‘ve red that there is not even a real law for collecting taxes from private people. There never was a majority for such a law so the USA is forcing  people paying money out of thin air.

P/E Ratio of lots of companies was like 100 back then in Japan. In comparison Bitcoin is a Commodity at least for now with Zero correlation with other assets at the very moment. Hard to compare, I would say. But I get the point you expressing your negativity, which I use as a Contra indicatior, when to buy more Bitcoin. ;) 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:15:28
Both posts together are describing risks and possible rewards. I also would do research about FIAT money and how money is created mostly trough debts. Correlation between assets is also important so the better question overall is: what is bitcoin and not should I invest in it. 
Just my point of view. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:35:58
I personally would never store my cryptos on my phone so I excluded Android.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:17:01
If so, Bitcoin will never be mainstream. Like noone uses Linux in normal life world.

I work with cold storage. But it’s not good, if regular people can’t use safe wallets with mainstream OS for pc. Maybe one day we get there
