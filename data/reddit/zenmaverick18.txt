hi Zane...at time of attack all my BTC was margined to buy ETC..I checked my bfx deposit address on blockchain and I guess it immediately gets transferred to a different address? It shows my BTC is unspent, but it looks like it was moved into another address as soon as it got there. This was two days ago. Does that sound like my account is safe?

my BTC was moved into a different address at 10:00 UTC. Yet I was still watching my positions and monitoring my account til the moment u went offline and I didn't notice anything missing. U announced the hack at 18:13 UTC, my transfer happened at 10:00, and I was watching it without concern until the announcement. Am I fucked? Or when you make a margin trade is yours stuff transferred from your deposit address to a different address?

thanks for your response

please clarify!
I used 100% of my 22 BTC to buy 10k ethers on margin. Obviously ETC went up during that time and you settled all accounts at 18:00. So at 2.84, my account should be worth 28k. But the 22 BTC I used to start the position was only 13k. So am I being reimbursed based on what I was trading and my account value (10k ethers at 2.84) or just the BTC that I deposited which would already cut my account in half before the socialization even started?

what time did the hack start? Looks like my BTC was removed at 09:00 UTC. When you're margin trading is your BTC moved to a different address? They didn't tell anyone anything until 18:16 UTC. So I hope it's not the case but it looks like the hacker was there for up to 6 hours.

Hi Zane,
I had 100% of my BTC in the margin account to lever ETC. it was all being used to buy 100% ETC. I was never in danger of liquidation or anything as ETC moved up but I am wondering if I still have the position at all anymore since I paid for it in BTC?
