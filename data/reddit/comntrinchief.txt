Why? I have already paid taxes on the money I am risking. The government didn’t create crypto currencies. They don’t regulate it. Why should they get a cut for a purely financial risk I, not them, am taking. Why must they get a cut of EVERYTHING? Why would anyone defend them getting a cut of everything? They waste and steal over half of what they take from us already.

Any idea when the lightning network will be implemented? I currently have a BTC transfer begun 14 hours ago with zero confirmations.

If you have yet to sell and achieve a gain are you responsible for taxes on the increase in the value of your crypto holdings?

If you haven’t cashed back in to fiat at a profit have you actually “made money in cryptocurrency”? You don’t make a capital gain until you sell a stock at a profit.

I didn’t say that. I am arguing against taxing cryptos in general.

I am OK being taxed on the income as long as I can write off the exact same percentage in losses. Otherwise, it is unfair. Having said that I still don’t see why the government should have the right to tax every single new potential income stream invented. There is literally no way to make money where you don’t have to give a chunk of it to corrupt politicians.

Don’t worry. As long as you don’t make a profit they won’t tax you. /s

How do you go about offering a fee? Who would I offer it to? It is from Gatehub to my hardware wallet. Could it just be Gatehub delaying it or is it just not being mined? Thanks

What? I asked the same question twice and then vented to someone else about crypt income being taxed in general. I was looking for an answer because  someone  else had told me you don’t have to sell to be taxed....that we are to be taxed on the gains of our holdings alone. I assumed they were wrong and it would work the same way as capital gains but thought I would ask anyway. Of course, I will read the tax code before filing my taxes.

Dude you need to work on your reading comprehension and manners. Read it again slowly. Spell it out if you need to.
