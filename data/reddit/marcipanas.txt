I wish this was more informative subreddit.  
Now its 80% memes about BTC, 19% bashing the rival subreddit, and 1% relevant information about Bitcoin...

Are you dumb? Holding large amounts of your wealth on exchange is same as not having any wealth at all.

Well it all depends for how much you can sell the BTC and S2X coin after the fork. If BTC keeps its value after the fork and S2X coin is worth 0$ you do not get 100% profit you are exactly at the same spot you were before the fork.  
I think that after the fork BTC probably will go down a bit and S2X will start trading at very low price. Then if you combine price of BTC and S2X coin you will see how much profit you get from the fork.

Do you think Electrum is a good wallet? Which one would you recommend?
