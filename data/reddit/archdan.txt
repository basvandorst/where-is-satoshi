True! But shorting isn't the thing, the lockdown and inability to trade is. 
And everyone started as noob, I never entered this thing as make money quick stitch. I look at this as price for education.

No I wouldn't say end game for big government. Quite opposite, but I would be open in rise of new political system with corresponding to speed and flexibility of internet.   
    
Governments these days often rely on resources (and those resources are finite -&gt; therefore pushing the market) and those resources are part of territories. So that will never change. But trading part can if it is regulated by non bias structured civilisation - which internet provides (cat memes and all). So in near future I would say that is probable that new government will arise, and that government will be located in internet. We are awaiting interesting times. This society now has independent economy, all it needs is structure and we are there.

Sorry what do you mean by TA ? Technical analysis? If you ment technical analysis I would have to somewhat agree. There is much artificial push/pull for lining up charts to be accurate, but I don't know why it does make it a bit clearer. But as mentioned by lots of other users here I am a noob. Still lots to learn

No I don't want pity, I wanted to share my experience for anyone that is currently going through the same shit knows what is happening. How would pity benefit me ? I made mistake and learned from it.

It does everything but play in favor of the little guy. Have you ever wondered why xbtc\_eur price increases the moment when UK markets open ? There are big guys and algorithms that push 100 + bitcoin per day. Economy doesn't have emotions, it will hold no favors.

I still agree that no one should use Kraken. No exchange should allow for their traders to be locked out for any amount of time. Not at least this frequently. Any major movement on market and some people get locked out. That is why no one shouldn't use it.
And exchange should take responsibility for that, it can be in form of "sorry, fixing the problem" or something. I was lucky that I had little money. If someone with larger funds expirenced what I had it would be different thing.

What do you mean by stack sats?

I see no reason why would China go into bitcoin. By default it would "forgive" any dept EU and USA have towards China, since it would compete in foreign market. It seems logical that they would push for their own crypto currency to solidify their position.   
I see this as bot feeding the algo to be honest. So far in bunch of exchanges at time that Japans and Chinas market were open there was an drop or higher resistance.

I agree, and I think that most of people who trade or own any crypto currency (and are at least one bit educated on it) think.    
    
I would just like to add that loading into gold might not be opting out. Since crypto is so volatile market, it can be quite a jump with large fund investments. So something like country debt can take a large win/lose depending on the price and corresponding currency. It is too volatile for other country to accept it and still remain at similar or same foothold. But I think crypto is future. Perhaps not bitcoin, but all countries united under unique world wide decentralized currency. That is dream! :D

Hi Walter! :) I have no issue to have further communicating with you on this topic. However, since I used my real name and information , I wouldn't feel ok to share any information in public. However, I am open to communicate over private message, DM or whatever. 
Also I can inform you that I really did left Kraken, and have no intention of returning. But I am willing to go in depth to explain what were the issues in order to stop this happening to anyone else.

Who said Kraken should pay for my education? The experience and my emotional neurotic state is price for education.

Well, I was hopeful.

No. At least not now. I would wait till we understand full benefits and faults of quantum computing before thrusting all my imaginary people into it. I would however be in favour of it, and let some pioneers from my imaginary nation to take an m stab at it (with subventions). I would lie in wait and prepare whole economic system movement to digital world while we see if quantum computing will make hashes obsolete. Once there is no immediate threat to bitcoin, I would go an develop decentralised governmental crypto currency , removing fiat from circulation completely and relying whole imaginary economy to crypto / gold relationship.

Central banks buy in gold, since every currency is effectively worthless. Its value is determined by gold standard, and since crypto is reliant on fiat, therefore crypto is reliant on gold as well. This is how worth is decided for fiats, and crypto as well.   
    
Currently, volitility of an market depends on its volume, so any crypto that has low volume in contrast to fiat has more fluctuation in price. So if you have 1 btc and it falls in 2 pips, you have lost  2 fiat/pips in value. But if you have 150 000 btc ( an billion in debt for example) and it falls in 2 pips, you have lost 300 000 fiat/pips in value. So right now since crypto is unstable , it is logical that debt in size of an whole country and federation is still bought in gold since slight change can influence it greatly. So if China accepted bitcoin, USA-s debt to china could half in size depending on the market. There goes Chinas influence and all. 


 "But I think crypto is future. Perhaps not bitcoin " - Lol
Trough out history, it was never first draft of something that was accepted. It passed trough  severe testing and revisions. So yeah, perhaps not bitcoin (at least this version) but some new or other currency definitly. Don't forget quantum computing is almost here, which then nullifies safety of hashes.

Only in USA.
