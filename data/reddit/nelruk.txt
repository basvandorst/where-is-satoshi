I was skeptic about Microsoft accepting bitcoins but with your story, I have a very clear perspective.

I'm with you but in this particular case, understand most people feel bitcoin is used exclusively for terrorist/illegal things. It's ok (for now) to propagate and show how terrorism really works in the funding.  And also, bitcoin is used for scam actions while WU or MG is used for scam since the [Nigerian Prince Scam](

I'm not a scammer, relax dude.

I like the site but there are no current updates in the projects, makes me wonder how secure it is. But thank you for the option either way.

I living in Paraguay, we don't have any exchange and traditional entities aren't actually an option. I ask for help, if you don't like my idea, please offer one instead of just put negative comments that really doesn't help.

I try to open an IPO a few months ago. I just write them some concerns about it and never answered a thing but they're always sending me newsletters.

As you can read, in this post I asked about *Bitcoin exchanges made with open source projects* and thats it. I looked the project and seems interesting, but we as a team just getting started.
I'm grateful with the info you provided and my biggest concern is the security, my answer is vague because we still processing lots of information about how-to-do things. While I'm asking here, there are other people of the team looking for he same information.
Finally, if you have zero confidence about me or my team or my project (which you don't know at all) that's OK, it's your opinion. One thing is sure: we're going to open the exchange this year in my country.

This is awesome. I'm seeing other exchanges made with their source and they look very cool. Thank you so much.

Someone texted me this testnet called [Eclair]( and I was wondering if you know it.

I'm not saying that I will spend XXXXXX USD at once. We need to start my friend. Somehow..

For every payment I receive, I'm saving now..with bitcoin. Say I earn 100, so 10% direct is going to my savings now. I made myself a vouch to put my savings in bitcoins and now doing it and with profits. :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:24
That seems to be my destiny.

I couldn't find any actual proposition or draft. Do you know any site or place to find it?

Sadly, no..but we made some trading P2P..old school. The machine that has the account of the pizzeria wasn't working at the time. The owner of the local has a mining farm and Bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:39:24
There was one and appeared almost at the end. She's doing mining :\)
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:39:54
We ate that in 1 minute. Then we ordered 7 more..and we ate all of it.

Warren once said: *never invest in something you don't know,* in reply to a journalist who asked him how he survived the dot\-com bubble in 2000s. Does Warren really know and understand fully bitcoin to say something like he says?
Only time will tell us. My thoughts tell me he is wrong because he doesn't fully understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:22:39
That was the protocolar shoot. Then we ate 8 pizzas and lots of beer. :)

It's true. I can imagine other devs waiting to enter in that place. So, following the conversation, how *it's all true* is a problem in a long term? You said maybe today and tomorrow won't be a problem, what about a more long term?

Run for a while before the actual testnet and seems to be an awesome opportunity for both salesman and buyer. What I didn't test in those times were the dispute resolution. Set up a store and offer then try to sell is very easy and then buy is even easier with good design.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:08:59
Will you recommend some practices/wallets that you recommend?

In the last 2 years, I've been taking all my savings and turning into btc.
I'm more than ready now sir
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:52:06
As a hodler like you -but not with that amount- I feel the same.
@_date: 2016-09-24 03:57:45
If you save only 1 BTC from 2014, your assets should be great.

OpenBazaar is taking a direction I like and yes, I will run a store.

I put some bitcoins years ago in BTCJam. I think the main problem is all the scammers and default loans that couldn't control the legal issues; as many people feel swindled and saw how BTCJam just looked their problems without make anything. Put more and more people defaulted and you get the current problem.

Hester Peirce is our representative there.
At the moment of writing this, they more focused on businesses around bitcoin, not bitcoin itself. For instance they talk about being more clear about the business plan, explain where they are in the development process. Accounting matters often need to be explained. How will the token operate?
Again, for me, that's a business matter, not bitcoin related.
