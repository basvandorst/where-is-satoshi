At least the EU is taking some sort of care for their citizens. unlike US for example where all the the data rules are filled with loop holes benefits Big Companies.

sorry i don't understand, they pay you for the data?  i heard about GDPR and the trouble it caused big companies. i didn't think users will be rewarded. what do you mean by rewarded though?

Thanks for sharing your vision in Data and blockchain future, i think this is something than can help users gain control on their data finally.

That GDPR is good for EU residents. when do you think it would hit the US? as i understand Facebook already pushed all of her EU users agreements to be considered as  US resident...

From what i understood so far the data is aggregated in segments. so your personal data is not visible.

Big companies can't own in absolute manner over your information. this is the core of the GDPR regulation. big companies have to share it with you. Since it is YOURS. afterwards you can do whatever you want with it.
