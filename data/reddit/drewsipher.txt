if you have never heard of starcraft you are under a rock. Also e-sports has been a viable business for a while... But nice try trying to troll and instantly getting buried.

I recognized what it said instantly... And I don't really come here at all...
But you took out points without looking at my post as a whole so...
TL:DR there are added benefits using some advertising money on a sc2 team managed by one of the biggest gaming personalities on the internet as opposed to roping in a LoL team that may not be as established for the same amount. Also it was a community thing... Those are the two points I was trying to make, and the details as to why those points are fair ones to make. 
I am a huge Starcraft fan, but also watch LCS and The International... It isn't like I wouldn't have noticed this patch whether it was SC2 LoL or DOTA2...

It is fine, my whole point was just that maybe there are a few perks besides pure numbers. I am super defensive as a general rule so I went into super detail as to why Axiom was a great choice for to throw money at, and that the patch is probably just the TIP of the iceberg of how they will advertise. It is Total Biscuit, dude is legit.

this is again making the assumption that they only are using the money on axiom. Again Axiom is TotalBiscuits starcraft team, so I wouldn't be surprised if he starts talking about it in other places. The TB army is a large one so... I said in another spot in great detail there are multiple plus sides to putting money into axiom.

that sucks. should have sponsor badges on chests like EG that way it doesn't matter.

You could... do a 300% overclock on all your components... It will mine faster but blow up in 30 seconds...

So let me go down a list of a view things and why I think was good to advertise with Axiom.
Axiom is TotalBiscuits Starcraft team. He is ready and willing to pour every bit he can into that team. He has said before no matter what happens he will personally support every bit of the starcraft community he can. Axiom right now is mainly EU and NA focused but I wouldn't be surprised to see more KR focus as well (they had some when they teamed with Acer for Proleague but have since broke that partnership off) so to have your advertising dollar go to a guy like that is a big win.
The viewers right now will not be huge. WCS just ended. During the WCS tournament matches today there where between 20,000-40,000 at any point when I checked. And I expect a higher percentage of them are engaged in every aspect of the content. Every single one is hanging on every moment. It is smaller, more tight knit, and more eager to support things that support us. Hell I have played/tried random games on android because they advertise on GSL and Proleague matches... I know I am not the only one. 
It is really a question of percentages when you go into raw numbers. The percentage I think is higher in how many viewers relates to how many are willing to look into the advertisers on any given stream/team. Now is the percentage in such a way that you would get more bang for your buck on a LoL team? On top of that, what LoL team would you get. Axiom is one of the more solid Foreign teams in SC2 right now. From what I understand it was voted on here so obviously there is a reason the people on this subreddit chose a SC2 team as opposed to a LoL team.
