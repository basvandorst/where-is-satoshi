I did in a PM but obviously you know nothing about security protocols at enterprise level. Intel paid MILLIONS to sit on their leak for months to fix it because just the knowledge there WAS a critical bug at all could speed development of it up, potentially fasten than the fix. Anyways you are all dicks anyways, about 80% all wallets I review (popular open source ones) would allow excess funds to be sent to a 3rd party address instead of the remaining funds to your wallet. They just had to be running a modified version of enough nodes (even 2 would get some eventually, you could probably get hundreds of mil in a few months with 50+)
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:29:18
The link to the actual study isn’t working, but if IIRC there was maybe a 5% difference between 4MB and 8MB. Even at 40MB over half the network would still operate. However, that study was over 2 years ago and I’d bet that number has only gone up as bandwidth increases in average, not decreases. 
I guess I just don’t see how having 80-90% of the nodes running while increasing throughput by several orders of magnitude is “centralizing”. Was bitcoin centralized in the past at 7k nodes? 5k? 2k? People like to cling to the notion that everyone who wants to be able to run a node can, but the fact is they can’t right now, anyways. You shouldn’t need a fiber connection to run one, and obviously the blocksize can’t scale forever. But it also doesn’t preclude other forms of scaling, and would encourage adoption instead of places like Steam pulling out. 
However I don’t really think most people care about bitcoin as a currency anymore, just an investment, it seems.

I don’t feel like this is secure at all. There’s no reputation system for arbitrators, so no way to remove bad actors from the equation or even see who the bad actors are...
It is just ripe for an attack where one party runs a bunch of virtual servers acting as arbitrators, then starts a bunch of trades. If anyone picks any of his hundreds of arbitrators, there’s not need to actually follow through on the transaction and release bitcoins/fiat as his arbitrator can just confirm the transaction in his favor. And then he can do this over, and over, and over again because there’s no telling who a good/bad arbitrator is or how many times a person has disputed something.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:37:08
Yeah honestly there's no way for a trustless decentralized exchange to exist because fiat and coin swaps are not atomic and require to transactions that are verified independently. This is just fundamental and there's no way to overcome this. So I'd rather trust a large company with a verified track record than whoever I am trading with or whoever is arbitrating those transactions on a "decentralized" exchange.

Segwit was not compatible with old wallets. Because they couldn’t just invalidate everyone’s current wallets and transactions, segwit was made optional with its own type of address. It has to be supported forever because legacy addresses will always exist and it would be pretty shitty if all of the sudden they could transact on the network. So segwit is inherently optional, and some of the biggest exchanges (like Coinbase) still don’t use it. There are also a lot of mining nodes not running segwit as well. Something like only 30% has adopted it last I saw.

Not a popular opinion but neither will LN. It's use cases are much more limited than people like to admit. Primarily that it only saves transactions assuming both parties of a channel are willing to keep it open for a significant period of time, over which they send funds back and forth. If either of those parties wants to actually be able to put those coins in a different channel, refund the channel, sell them, etc, the channel will have to be closed out, requiring a transaction fee. Adding more funds to a channel also requires 2 transactions, one to close it out and one to open it with more funds.
I don't doubt there will be legitimate use cases that decrease the number of on-chain transactions. But it won't be this perfect solution everyone envisions.

What will happen? Atomic transfers for fiat? As I said it's not a matter of when it will be possible, it's *if* it will be possible. This is just fundamentally something that can't be solved on chain, as it requires someone (either a third party, or the buyer, or the seller) to verify that the fiat has been transferred. 
Even *if* a special card or bank account was made so money could be inserted and the bitcoin protocol was modified to transfer funds and bitcoin atomically it wouldn't be decentralized or trustless. 
I'd be interested to hear how you think this could even be possible, on a conceptual level. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:39:42
Those goals are achievable for *some* use cases which is why I think it will help the network. But I just don't think a lot of people understand that this won't be a magic fix all because a significant amount of transactions still have to happen on-chain. Not you, specifically, but I can't count the number of posts I've seen that are expecting this to solve everything when it's just one piece of a puzzle. Even with immediate adoption we'll be in the exact same situation in a couple years if the amount of transactions continue to grow. 
I guess another way to put it is maybe XX% of transactions could fit the use cases of LN. And XX% will still have to happen on chain. So this will allow for some incremental scaling for sure. But not the exponential growth BTC has seen the last couple years, or would be required for mass adoption as a currency. 
Honestly I think the only real long-term solution is going to rely on changes to the difficulty and frequency of blocks. But who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:39:38
If you are trying to do it all at the end of the year it might take awhile. However if you just keep track of your transactions as you go there’s really no problem. Most exchanges can also export your data and they all have a history so we really it shouldn’t be a problem anyways. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:08:03
Well, yeah. If on-block transactions take 10 minutes but an exchange doesn't post them for an hour that is indeed the exchange's fault. If that was what was happening with BTC this would be a fair point..but it's not. The bulk of fees and transaction times for BTC are built into BTC not the exchange. If an exchange does have relatively higher fees or transfer times for BTC people bitch about that here as well. 
This post is incredibly disingenuous.

It is 100% true. The passwords are hashed and stored in a database. But they are hashed *on the server* in virtually all cases, so of course the server sees your password. The passwords are generally sent over SSL but the web application gets them unencrypted in plain text. There's no benefit to hashing them client side, because then the hash could be used to login if intercepted, just like the password.
There's also no guarantee the server is even hashing your password at all though.

According to you services like AWS, Google Cloud Hosting, etc, are bad solutions because they don't solve the problem, they just kick it down the line...
You have no idea how many innovations and real world applications have come from simply scaling up existing technology. Super computers are essentially just a TON of networked computers working in unison, kind of *exactly* the opposite of what your picture seems to be stating.
Increasing the block size wouldn't preclude any other forms of advancement, just like adding more sticks of RAM, multi-GPUs, etc, doesn't preclude advancements in any of those technologies. 
There's actually an idiom for this: "Perfect is the enemy of the good." Just because you don't have a *perfect* solution, you shouldn't avoid implementing or pursuing a *good* solution. You're going to be left with something *bad* otherwise.

Also people here don't seem to understand how HTTP requests work.
Whether the password is transmitted as a query string (in the URL), or via a POST method the request will look identical. In either instance the password will be transmitted unencrypted to the site via the headers. They are functionally identical. Passwords are never encrypted client side. 
By utilizing SSL (https) however, the entire request is encrypted through on a protocol level so the passwords are NOT transmitted in plaintext and no one knows what they are except the people at both ends (you and the site you are sending the request to). The only rookie thing about this is that the password could be visible in your browser history for someone who had access to your computer. 
I don't know how people aren't understanding that a site has to have access to your password to log you in. That doesn't make it a password ripoff service, lol. That's why you should never reuse passwords.

This is a lot more complex than people make it out to be. You need a transaction to open a channel. You need a transaction to close it. You can’t fund it with more money without closing the channel and starting over. You can’t decide to spend the funds anywhere else without closing the channel, and opening a new one elsewhere. Even if the wallet makes this simple to do it’s not going to be useful for the types of things people think it will be. Unless you are OK locking up your funds for a long time, and the receiving party is OK with keeping the channel open without consolidating the transactions then it just won’t be worth it to use it to pay for things. It also requires *a lot* of people to be willing to do the same and fun *a lot* of channels continuously. With its volatility merchants aren’t going to want to keep their funds in a channel, they’re going to want to convert to fiat ASAP. They can’t sell you a $10 pizza and hope it’s still $10 when they close the channel out in a couple weeks...

However, no someone can't give birth to another "me" but they can give birth to someone with my same name so this is also a silly point.
Also, since there is no central authority behind either BTC or BCH you can't call them Company A Bitcoin and Company B Bitcoin so that's why the monikers are added at the end, that's all.

You won't have to open a channel with that specific person necessarily, but that still doesn't change anything about my post. Also, funds aren't going to rebalance to your channel unless you have another channel open with someone else with a balance on your end. But not you can't send funds through that channel because the funds are on the other end.
Most people simply aren't going to have multiple channels open and funded. Like I said it will undoubtedly reduce the number of transactions, but I don't think it can be this infinitely scalable solution a lot of people seem to thing. I don't even think it will reduce the transactions by an order of magnitude which would still lead to the same situation a few years out.

To be fair I haven’t used it so I’m not entirely sure, and the white paper doesn’t explain the arbitration process very well. However if what you said is true and there’s only one arbitrator that doesn’t make it very decentralized. How/to whom is this deposit make? The users bay a security deposit, but the arbitrator actually gets a fee from what I read, not pay a debt.
If they do pay a deposit, then who is arbitrating the arbitrators to verify their decisions? It seems the concept fundamentally needs to be centralized to some degree or to inherently going to have these risks. When you are doing 2 non-atomic transactions (a fiat transfer, and a separate BTC transfer, that are confirmed separately) you are going to have to trust *someone*. I’d rather it be a centralized exchange so I actually know who I’m trusting..

There’s a lot more reason for a slow-rollout such as market testing, usage statistics, product performance, etc. For example, it’s extremely common for physical products, esp food items, to be rolled out slowly and tested in different markets.

There is a happy medium between never raising the block size, and raising it so much that it becomes too difficult to run nodes. 8MB wouldn’t have a noticeable impact on the network, according to any actual research.
You are worried that it would centralize the network by making it so only rich people can run nodes. But have you considered that the high fees we have now centralize the network, in that only people who have a couple hundred or thousand plus in bitcoins can even afford to move them? Anyone with less than that would have to spend a considerate portion so they’re kind of just locked. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:30:37
Actually for most of its life BTC has always been intended to be used as a currency. It’s only been recently that everyone started just excusing high transactions fees as a “store of value”. This is the only long term chance it has at success, if people can actually spend it, IMO. How can you have a digital store of value with no actual utility? Everyone should be pushing for more adoption for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:06:01
It’s basically just a new protocol that allows more transactions to fit into one block. It doesn’t provide any accuse benefits to you, but if *everyone* used it the network throughput would increase. With current transaction fees it’s not worth moving at all unless you were going to move them anyways. You just need a wallet that can generic SegWit addresses, and then send your coins there.

As long as whatever channel your BTC are in remains open permanently. But during that time neither party will be able to move the coins out of the channel or add funds to it so that's not very likely. Eventually you're going to need an on block transaction.

Ignoring mining fees at the moment, it’s fundamentally the same if your purchase something with fiat or bitcoin. Any money you spend in USD is money you could have out into bitcoin and to hold onto. So the only reason it makes sense to spend USD is because spending BTC and replacing it would incur fees, but spending one or the other is not inherently a bad decision especially if transaction fees are ever resolved. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:44

Yes, I’m sure Satoshi envisioned $10+ transaction fees when he was conceptualizing Bitcoin. Transaction fees are definitely a feature,  but **high** transaction fees are not a feature that’s “working as indented”, we shouldn’t just completely ignore it just because some TX fees are inherent.

They can take the bitcoins you’ve paid them and sell them to an exchange, that’s the whole point. They’d have to close out your channel which defeats the whole purpose. Even if hey do have another channel open with the exchange, coins paid to then are not available. And yes, they could take that risk but I don’t see them doing. So, so easy to become insolvent if you need the money to pay network fees but bitcoins in a dip. Now you’ve already paid merchants $1,000,000 but only have $700,000 in bitcoin. For the fee to be worth the risk you might as well just be doing them on block. We’ll see what happens but the majority of transactions are going to happen onblock IMO.

There isn't much benefit for them, because the only time they actually write an onblock transaction is when someone transfers out to a different address. 98% of their bitcoins are actually stored in an offline wallet. So people can buy and sell millions of dollars of bitcoin and all they do is just transfer a balance in a database. It *could* allow people to send in BTC to sell easier, but this is a small % of their daily trades and I'm sure they'll want to see how LN actually ends up working in practice. This would be more beneficial for a a merchant and not an exchange.

You don’t know the value of bitcoin will never go to $0. *If* some major event happened - major government regulation, some vulnerability getting exploited, coinbase getting seized/involvement/hacked, market manipulation, etc, etc - and people really started to lose faith it really could spiral down, and all the “HODL”ers will be trading with each other sub $100. That’s not everything, but honestly it might as well be for anyone who bought in 10k+. The truth is mass adoption is what will likely lead to the “bubble” bursting if you want to call it that. The more people who hold more bitcoin who are not that educated on it, don’t know the price patterns over the year, the more likely they are to pull out for a major event and cause an avalanche. 
Why do you want people to have confidence it will stay? Is it because you want to have the confidence your investment won’t be lost? It’s only unproductive in that it’s unproductive for your mental health because you don’t want to believe that could ever happen. This HODL at all cost mentality is stupid and just needs to die. You are as irrational as the uneducated investors you’re deriding, just instead of panic selling in fear you’re going to faith hold in optimism.

Block size and centralization is only a slippery slope argument, because it is something the is only a concern at much higher block sizes, not 8MB.
And it is hyperbolic, but it’s not deceitful. The people who most vehemently supported a block chain increase saw that BTC developers to come to consensus on this (and even if they did, without Blockstreams blessing users would be unwilling to support it).

How? If you want to loan me 1 BTC on a lightening channel, I can move those coins anywhere else to actually use them until the channel is closed. Also once you send the coins to me on a lightening channel there is nothing requiring me to ever pay them back and the channel could just close and you’d have nothing to show for it. The lightening protocol doesn’t allow for trustless Loans in anyway I can see.

People are vastly underestimating the block size that would be needed for any real centralization if reduction of nodes to occur. We’d be talking orders of magnitudes higher. 8MB doesn’t do it. 80MB would still have barely a statistically significant impact. And as network speeds increase in the future, block size could grow proportionately.

I appreciate your optimism but stuff will never be free in a capitalistic society as long as people want it. The whole reason all that stuff is so plentiful is *because* people pay for it to be made. If people weren’t paying for it, it would stop being made. QED. 
You have to consider everything that goes into producing your t-shirt, on all levels of the supply chain. Someone needs to smelt the metal to build the tools to mine the phosphate to make the fertilizer to grow the cotton to spin into fabric to sew into a shirt for someone to print on to transport it to where it needs to go just so you can get your “cheap” t-shirt. And that’s leaving out everything that goes into machining the tools, making the ink for silkscreening, all the labor involved, the electricity, the upkeep of all the facilities. I don’t know how you could possibly fathom all this being free in any economic system involving a market for you to spend your coins on at all.

There’s no long term solution using LN either. Transactions *have* to be settled on block, and coins on a LN channel cannot be ,over anywhere else without settling. It’s as simple as that. Yes, it will help, but in and of itself it’s not a long term solution anymore than forking would be. 
I think the best way to view it is to imagine every LN as a new coin. If you had BTC, and BTCa, BTCb... It would help for sending coins on the sub BTCx but you couldn’t send them between each other, or to people not on any sub channel without first settling to BTC. If you want to add more coins to BTCa *everyone* on BTCa has to have the transaction settled, then another transaction each for everyone to refund. It’s not the miracle people seem to envision. 
It delays onblock transactions. It doesn’t get rid of them, or even reduce them by an order of magnitude+ that would be required for long term scaling.

Right now once you pay them they can take all the payments for an hour or until they’ve accumulated a good amount and sell them to convert to USD. With lightning they’d have to keep your channel open for weeks or more, so instead of getting the immediate market value they have their coins tied up until the channel closes. Exact same problem, just bitpay instead of the merchant. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:25:06
Everyone here thinks this is going to be revolutionary, but I don't see it happening. To me this has very limited use cases.
The major thing everyone is missing is that companies (like the coffee thing everyone keeps mentioning) are not going to want to take the risk of keeping the funds in a channel for a long period of time. They need to balance the books nightly, they can't just have all the money tied up in bitcoin. This is why things like Bitpay settle immediately on the merchant site - you pay in bitcoins but those are offloaded to bitpay for cash instantly so that coffee would always net them $4. Not .0001 BTC whatever that happens to be worth in a week when they close out the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:53
This is probably the best explanation I've seen: 
Very oversimplified, but the channels use one way hashes so that the secrets can be exchanged between each other, but unless you know the secret that was used to make the hash you can't include that and verify the transaction, and it's not until the final ledger is broadcast to the blockchain that it would be viewable to anyone who wasn't in the channel. That link explains it much better.

Do they want to reduce their liability? Of course they do. Their insurance will get more expensive the higher bitcoins price rises and the more coins they hold. They don’t want to encourage everyone to store them there.

What do you mean when BCH has big ideas? Do you mean when Coinbase has big ideas? They were the ones who knew the exact timing of this. Also this is so silly to get butthurt about their “big ideas”. Nobody gets mad at other alt coins when they get big ideas that cause an influx of users. If so many people are leaving bitcoin for another coin, maybe bitcoin should look at why that is.

Nothing stops you from making on-chain transactions like you do now. But individual users aren’t going to need to open and maintain their own channel, anymore than they need to open and maintain their own exchange.

You don’t ever have to use a “centralized” LN. But I believe the word your looking for is privatized, because anyone can deploy their own LN, there will be many competing ones to use, and you’ll always be able to make on chain transactions just like you do now. 
Saying this is going to make it centralized is like saying exchanges are centralized because they are owned by private companies and are proprietary. Private LN networks wouldn’t contribute any more to centralization than exchanges. Everyone will always have the option of making transactions without the need for an exchange, or any additional layers on bitcoin.

It's impossible to track this, from the blockchain anyways. The only thing that gets recorded is the final ledger, none of those intermediary steps matter at all to the end result, and the whole point of doing them off-chain is so they don't all need to end up on the main chain.

What transactions are people doing now, that would be done on a lightening network to reduce number of on lock transactions? Lightning network locks up your funds and still require 2 on chain transactions (one to get on, one to get off). They also require a large investment of funds in multiple channels to be useful. If A wants to send 10 BTC to C, and B has a channel with both A and C, then B has to have at least 10 BTC just sitting in his channel to C...then after it’s sent A can’t send anymore to C without both channels being closed and funded at both ends. And even if you don’t want to send more, neither B nor C can send their funds to anyone else without closing the channel. 
The only real use case could be for exchanges and merchants, where you’d be sending them multiple payments in a short amount of time. But payments for services aren’t happening now, and intraexchange transfers aren’t on block to begin with.
This is going to have a much smaller impact than most people realize. I feel like the people thinking it will solve everything fundamentally don’t understand the limitations because none of them have been able to explain *how* it will fix things other than saying people aren’t going to use the chain anymore..ok but *how* will this actually function to let everyone complete most the transactions they do now off chain?

I’m not putting a label on it...I’m just explain why volatility of any sort will reduce adoption as a currency. If bitcoin doesn’t ever see wide use as a currency what do you think is going to hold up its value? And before I hear “well the USD isn’t backed by anything!”, yes it is. It’s backed by the millions of people and the government who are relying on its use at a currency. If USD were *ONLY* something that could just be traded for gold, and you had to use gold to actually buy any service or good, do you think USD would just rise and rise in value and trade for more and more gold? No, it would lose any value in relation to gold because you can’t do anything with it.
Adoption as a means of buying goods and services is vital to the bitcoins long term success, I don’t see anyway around this. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:31:45
Of course it’s mostly developers of other coins who agree with this. They all moved away from BTC because of these differences in philosophy. 
Also, centralization would be a concern. But this is purely a slippery slope argument, with it being an inevitability some point in the distant future at 80 or 80MB. 8MB would have next to zero effect at reducing the number of nodes in any statistically significant way. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:57:30
Let's say I open a bunch of Channels. A-&gt;B, B-C, B-D. If A wants to pay D but none of my channels are funded I can't really do shit. The coin that would go into my A-B channel from B is different than the channel I have open from B-D. It doesn't transfer to the new channel without an on-block transaction.
So if you want to send 1BTC through 5 hops, everyone on each of those hops needs to have 1BTC to move it through. Then their 1 BTC is in a different channel, that can be moved the other way.
So yes, to relay through channels they each need to be funded.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:27:03
That’s 4 people and counting now who e all told me I’m wrong without even being able to write even *one* paragraph* about how LN can reduce transactions by a significant number.

It’s on an upward trend overall. But this doesn’t mean anything for business, who are going to convert it to USD as quickly as possible. You have seen all the times it’s bounced from up, then down, then up, then down lower, then back up again? Sometimes as much as like 20-30% or more. These are what would be bad for a business, even if it’s just worth a couple percent less by the time they consolidate it.
Contrary to what people think, volatility of any kind is bad for adoption as a currency. If it can swing so quickly upwards, it can swing just as quickly downwards. As a currency businesses would prefer to see much slower, steady growth. So your idea of bitcoin as an “investment” is at odds with bitcoin as a “currency”, but without being able to buy things with it then it won’t have any long term value. The current price is solely due to its speculation on future uses. If it came out today that Bitcoin would never be used for any real world transactions ever again it would absolutely tank.

Daily volume isn’t the best indicator. For example I could have 1000 coins, but they could get traded 10,000 daily.   But a loss of even 50 coins would still be pretty substantial. Volume is most indicative of demand (or lack thereof sometimes), not volume of coins. That could vary several orders of magnitude with the same # of coins depending on the market. Your sentiment is on point though, just not related to volume.

You are still using the US dollar as a reference point, even if you use a pack of gum.
Let’s say a pack of gum is $1. So .1mBTC. Now let’s say the price of bitcoin doubles. Is a pack of gum still .1mBTC? Cause if so you’re saying a pack of gum would now cost $2. Because that’s the price you could not get for your .1mBTC. It can’t be $1 = 1 pack of gum = .1mBTC = $2, that doesn’t work.
In short real world items are already set on the dollar, so if you try to give bitcoin a value in real world items, that’s just an indirect way of giving it a dollar value.

Again, take off the quotes if that makes you feel better. Or hell take that sentence out entirely. It doesn’t change the point of my post at all. I specifically put quotes around it because those are 2 very different things that are not bitcoin, but they describe 2 different things people want bitcoin to be used for, and that people should generally understand what is meant unless they’re being purposefully obtuse. Regardless, labels are useful for describing things, there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. “Don’t label bitcoin a cryptocurrency **reeeee!**”. Look at nearly every post in this sub and then tell me people aren’t using bitcoin to invest in. Then look at what post this is on, where people were using it to buy Steam games..as a currency. This are 2 very simple concepts, I’m not sure why these words are confusing you.  
I didn’t explain away things I didn’t understand. You are entirely ignoring the rest of the post just so you can focus on this so called labeling.

As I said, that would open up massive security holes, because you could "blacklist" any address and create or distribute the coin however you want and you'd have to gut all the underlying checks that currently maintain the integrity of the blockchain. It would completely destroy the fundamental way bitcoin works. It's not impossible, to change the code to do whatever the hell you want. But it's impossible with the way it's currently built on a very low level so you'd have to change like everything about it.

It’s not about them getting in trouble for helping you launder money, it’s the same thing where’s a risk for them because they’re obliged to repay you if someone defrauds you. BTC is the  goto for anyone who gains fraudulent access to a bank accounts or credit cards. Any other bank you can send it to, anything you can buy with it, all of it will be traced and can be followed ultimately to wherever it lands up. If you buy BTC with it though you’ve now gotten off 100% Scott free. There’s no transaction they can reverse, no paper trail they can follow to try to recoup it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:08:33
I guess the issue most people have is that CC/PayPal/whatever fees are built into the cost of the item. If you pay for any transaction with Bitcoin the fees aren’t built in. So whatever it is, coffee, a t-shirt, it’s going to cost me as a customer more than it would otherwise. Transaction fees are also so variable. A year ago transaction fees were never over .50 cents. Now the average transaction fee has been up to $19. Where are you getting 40 cents? Maybe not *right this second* but for today the average transaction fee was $5. You say bitching like it’s fine and should just be ignored.
People keep changing the goal posts. Originally the general consensus was that bitcoin was going to be huge as a currency, and every retailer that implemented it was celebrated. I remember people talking about the future where you could walk in and order a coffee with bitcoin. Now your fees will cost more than the coffee. But this is going to discourage retailers from implementing it and customer from using it. You aren’t paying for a useful service. You’re paying a bitcoin tax for a service you can already do cheaper. 
Yes, solutions are being worked on. But for all these second layer solutions it’s still going to take a transaction fee to get your money into that layer. All that will do is save you fees if you are making multiple purchases within the same layer, so it’s pretty much the same problem, or worse because if you move money into that layer anticipating multiple transactions, but don’t use all the funds then you’ll have to pay *another* transaction fee to move it back into the main ledger.

In a market where currency is deflationary this now makes the currency a better “investment” than actual investments, which leads to people hoarding the money instead of investing in businesses and driving the economy. This had a much bigger impact than people buying phones and computers. 
It also increases the “real value” of debt. So say you borrow $1000. I could have bought 100 barrels of oil with that. I have to pay that back in a couple years, but since deflation has occurred you can now buy 140 barrels of oil so it’s actually costing me a lot more to pay off that debt (the same amount of cash but what I’m paying back is 40% more valuable than what I borrowed). In an economy where the money supply is tightly controlled and actually decreasing then your salaries will actually *go down* to keep up with deflation, instead of going up to keep up with it. So it’s just going to get harder and harder for borrowers to pay off long term debts like houses.

The problem is that the prepaid card would be closed out anytime the merchant actually wants to get the USD in their bank account. Everyone is talking about how revolutionary this is going to be for buying things, but they fail to address that one problem. Merchants are not going to want to tie up their money in bitcoins for weeks and keep all these channels open. They're generally going to want to settle the transactions for cash immediately, so they know they always get $4 for a coffee. Not xxx satashis, whatever those will be worth in a month.

If I pay someone on a channel .05 BTC for my coffee (let's pretend that's just worth $5), until that channel is closed out they can't do anything with the money, like sell it to people who aren't also on the channel. Any company that accepts BTC as payment generally wants to consolidate it into USD as quickly as possible, because if you leave that channel open for months or even days who knows if they'll get their $5, or if it will be $3 at the moment they need to balance their books. It just greatly complicates the accounting process because one day you could have $15k held up in channels, the next $10k, the next $18k. That's why all the bitcoin payment pretty much just abstract the bitcoin away from the company and from their end it's just dealt in USD.

You're basically saying that their roadmap can never change. Lightening network was just an abstract theory years ago and didn't begin to be seriously developed until it was apparent it would be needed. I'm sure if/when it becomes apparent a better solution is needed (much, much further down the line) then alternate solutions will be developed. 
LN is also not really a solution to longterm scaling people think it will be anyways. Mainly because requires that you are going to be buying something from the merchant at least 3 separate times before the transaction fees for moving money to and from the channel are worth it. Merchants are not going to keep channels open for weeks at a time. They are going to want to consolidate for USD and settle their books pretty much daily, if not more. This is an accounting nightmare, no merchant wants all their money tied up in Bitcoin. They need to know that they are getting $4 for a coffee. Not .0001 satashis, whatever that will be worth in a month when they close the channel.
Seriously, how do people think this is going to work? As long as they need to pay employees and taxes in USD there's zero chance of companies risking holding their revenue in BTC for any meaningful period of time.

But..but...it would be stupid to draw out 100% of what I put in so I didn’t have to worry about losing my savings! When bitcoin doubles again the. I’ll only have made 18x my money back when I could have made 20!

Let’s say I don’t like the way the TCP/IP protocol does some things. If I fork the codebase and then make some changes, it’s perfectly acceptable to call it TCP/IP Swift or whatever. This is very very common in open source projects when things share so much of the same code base. It doesn’t need to be a point of contention. 
Look at cocos-2D and cocos-2D-x. They are both cocos-2D. Nobody’s bitching about which is the real cocos-2D. They’re seeing what the other does well and implementing and improving as needed. 
Look at FreeBSD Linux, Linux, Unix, a jillion other flavors. They are all Linux/Unix. Nobody’s arguing which is the real Linux, instead they’re comparing features a design philosophy. 
This is not abnormal at all. Arguing about whether something it the “real” bitcoin is entirely counter-productive. What is this going to prove? It doesn’t inherently make one superior than the other. I don’t know why people are so butt hurt about this, like the only thing you can argue over is the name?

You are still using the US dollar as a reference point, even if you use a pack of gum.
Let’s say a pack of gum is $1. So .1mBTC. Now let’s say the price of bitcoin doubles. Is a pack of gum still .1mBTC? Cause if so you’re saying a pack of gum would now cost $2. Because that’s the price you could not get for your .1mBTC. It can’t be $1 = 1 pack of gum = .1mBTC = $2, that doesn’t work.
In short real world items are already set on the dollar, so if you try to give bitcoin a value in real world items, that’s just an indirect way of giving it a dollar value.

Take off the quotes if that makes you feel better. I’m not just calling that to call it that or say that’s what bitcoin is, those 2 things describe very different use cases. 
It doesn’t matter how I label it. But it does matter how it’s used. I don’t know why everyone on Reddit gets so hung up on arguing semantics or a small detail, while just completely being obtuse to the point of a comment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:00:07
This will never happen. With how BTC works this wouldn't be possible. You *cannot* recover private keys, otherwise it puts every single bitcoin address at great risk. There's just no way to do this in a way that isn't going to create massive security issues.

A year is recently dude. That’s a very, very small amount of time, you are LUCKY if some investments get 10% over that time, and you got 50x that. It doesn’t matter if growth has slowed down the last few weeks or month. In a very recent amount of time you’ve 50 times over increased your money.

Where are all these people who got tricked and confused into buy bitcoin cash? Did they get tricked into bitcoin gold? Bitcoin platinum? Any exchange where you can get bitcoin gold also have bitcoin cash. Most USD exchanges you can only trade for bitcoin. No one is getting confused and coming into crypto accidentally with a bunch of bitcoin cash. 
Also, who gives a shit about market cap? Your exact same argument applies to bitcoin too, with estimates as much as 30% or more have been lost. It didn’t “magically” come into existence anymore than half of bitcoins market cap “magically” came into existence this last month. 
The exact same thing that pumped bitcoin cash is the same thing that pumped bit coin up: other people wanting to buy it. That’s it. Bitcoin isn’t any better in that regard other than it was first. People either like the technology and direction of the project or they just think they can print money with it. 
Holy shit, seriously. Pot, this is kettle. Everyone of your complaints, save the flimsy one about the name, *literally* applies to bitcoin too.

This is a really shitty idea. If it was a new video game feature, whatever. You don't just fuck with peoples money and alpha test this shit live. The moment anyone does anything stupid (and it would, regardless of warnings), or an exploit is found that drains peoples channel funds the media would have a hayday with it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:58:35
This is not correct.
A-B is a different channel than B-C
So if A wants to send 1BTC to C, B would have to have 1BTC to send to C. B would now have 1 BTC in his A-B channel, and none in his B-C channel. 
The funds don't hop channels without an onblock transaction. So if you want to send 1BTC through 5 hops, each of those channels has to have 1BTC to push to the next person.

They have their bounties clearly listed:  and significant manipulation of account balance is only set at $5k. This is on the site where OP submitted the exploit. There's no reason he should have expected more than this, and if he wasn't happy with that amount then he should have tried to negotiate a different agreement instead of just sending instructions over and hoping they'll pay him more than they've listed.

Non-self destructive people always harm others too, if you want to completely over generalize. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:21:24
Nope, the only way to do that would be to open up a new channel. Essentially you're just trusting them to credit you funds back on the channel.

The whole point of LN is that there will be less transactions on the main block. If fees "balanced out" then it wouldn't help anything at all.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:26:21
While Coinbase hasn't handled this perfectly, to be fair to them their bounties are clearly listed: 
Significant manipulation of account balance is $5k, while only executing remote code is higher at $10k. I'm not sure where OP came to expect $25k, without any type of arrangement prior to giving them instructions.
Secondly, OP basically sent them proof he was not in compliance with their terms of use and regulations, so as a matter of course they are legally obligated to terminate their banking relationship with him, which they tried to explain in their message to him. 
Other than better communication, what would you really have them do to make this "right"?

Bitcoins aren’t flowers, they don’t smell good, you can’t plant them in the ground, they don’t photosynthesis. Tell me more about your analogy..
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:03:33
It isn't a manual process. So you don't just hand someone money and hope they pass it along. I don't know how it works on a technical level but it should propagate through the channels automatically and immediately.

Well, it’s not. You can always do private sales, worst case scenario. But that defeats a lot of the purpose of being able to get and send bitcoin anywhere in the world, being trust less, etc. So I think exchanges are a necessary evil or there’d be no way to get coins in and out of btc very fast or without getting scammed st all. I was just asking how you thought a built in exchange would be possible at all, even conceptually. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:17
How would this be possible? If you have $10000 USD and you want buy 1 BTC, where would you send your money? You have to either directly send it to the person you’re trading with, in which case the platform would just act as a shitty trading board, or you have to have some 3rd party intermediary to take the cash and facilitate trades. There’s just not a feasible programmatic solution that doesn’t require a 3rd part to take wire transfers, process cards, etc.

That’s entirely the point he’s trying to make; bitcoins have double the buying power, but USD has exactly the same. That’s not USD halving, that’s BTC doubling. Otherwise you are saying BTC stayed exactly the same and USD halves, because you can’t have it both ways. But we know that’s not the case. Every currency in the world hasn’t lost half its buying power. I thought this whole post was a joke but people are taking it way too seriously. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:09:40
So...why wouldn’t you just exchange the Zimbabwe dollars for USD. And then buy 1 BTC and have money left over?

Also from what I’ve seen they wouldn’t get rid of PayPal as an option, they’d simply make their first party solution he default payment method. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:44:16
Yeah sorry but I don’t want my wages paid in BTC. If you are just talking about a USD to BTC conversion at the time of payment then essentially the company is just buying coins for you. But if you mean your salary is XX BTC per hour then I don’t want to have 30% less spending power this week because BTC is down. 
Way too volatile to be pushing for things like this.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:42:16
I guess they mean that all your transaction history would be visible to be other party. “Centralized”. However I don’t see how this is any worse than having your whole transaction history on the blockchain anyways.
