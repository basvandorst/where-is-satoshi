It will make you less of a prophet and more of a human.
@_date: 2019-07-19 10:45:25
Also Bitcoin is not a unit of account lol.
@_date: 2019-11-26 11:27:46
The halving?
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:00:04
Yeah wrong stock but great rule of thumb :D
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:46:06
Nothing smells better than burnt bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-14 16:18:42
And what exactly are you expecting her to say in that situation?
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:07:55
Kiss my ass
@_date: 2019-11-26 12:23:43
You're right!
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:23:21
Sounds great! HOWEVER, there is always a risk of losing your keys :). So keep 10-15k in a boring saving account. It will find you a place to stay shall you lose your keys and most importantly, save you from your parents scrutiny.
Best of luck!

Aaaand Bitcoin dipped a little.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:19:55
When it's that guy then yes, it is bad.
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:18:38
How, where and when should you buy? I'd say nowhere, never, and null! You're not responsible enough to invest.
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:52:39
Very nice!
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:57:49
It's upon him to prove that he is Satoshi, by signing a message using a private key that's associated with Satoshi public keys. Otherwise we're feeding him the attention he seeks direly.
@_date: 2019-06-14 11:27:25
I thought the global currency has been created ten years ago :/.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:31:15
Not trying to be a leader of this sub. Sounds like a messy job to me lol. I'm just pleaing people to relax.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:14:21
Run away!
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:03:35
I have no idea. I can't see him dethroning US's single largest source of power (world's global dollar), yet alone by a tweet. Crypto community is kind of delusional.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:39:54
I'm not interested in hearing him or any other "celebrity" talking about crypto, as if it's their own invention. Bitcoin is here DESPITE of them all.
@_date: 2019-06-14 11:48:42
Yeah but it's mandatory if you'd like to tap into any kind investments. Otherwise you subject yourself to the risks mentioned above.
@_date: 2019-06-14 11:32:05
In brief, have an emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of expenses.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:42:46
Also youtube-dl works with YouTube as well as any video links including Reddit.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:04:32
Let that be a lesson to never talk about finaces with people. They might turn envious or comepletely indefferant at best. That's just human nature.
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:21:37
The elderly still love these fluffly messages, unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:32:19
It's not for you grandpa.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:17:59
Brace yourself for downvotes from the FOMO army, my realistic friend :).
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:02:43
I applaud your efforts but honestly, that piece of shit is not worth it. He feeds on our attention
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:10:55
The entire world would recommed that you have a long-term perspective. Don't invest expecting parabolic short-term returns! If that's you're strategy then you're rekt, sooner or later.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:41:02
You'd live like a king in 2013!
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:23:26
It has nothing to do with an open, permissionless, borderless and verifiable blockchain. Basically it's a shittier version of XRP.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:13:33
Yes, as long as your Ledger is safe then you're fine. Ledger Live is merely a UI that helps to manage your accounts but only if your ledger device is connected.
EDIT: many typos

Unfortunately, he will die before changing his mind.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:29:27
That's just rude.
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:45:02
If you were a government that controls the entire world with its money, would you really open the door for a decentralised tech that will dethrone you? Probably not. Perhaps you won't fight it openly either because that will draw more eyes to it. Perhaps the best thing you can do is to try and suffocate it very slowly and  carefully.
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:02:34
Because they're running on partial reserve.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:50:08
You're not being useful.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:08:03
That is kinda sad.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:17:32
True. Thanks for the clarification :)
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:59:01
Why does he glue his face to the camera like this?
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:18:06
We can't upvote this enough!
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:30:09
A Bitcoin is worth a thousand burritos so...
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:37:57
Yeah we bring popcorn and watch. No one is listening during this euphoria.
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:16:37
So when are they launching? And after launching for select customers, when will it be available for the public? I'm sorry but you gotta be a little bit more useful in your post than just posting a link with an optimistic title!
