No, he's like someone who takes a wallet left on the bus and returns it to the owner, instead of leaving it there for someone to steal.

Yup, laugh when they steal my 0.00004 BTC.

It's very difficult to steal if it's secured properly. Use a strong enough key with an encrypted wallet and it's basically impossible to steal with current computing power. Don't let a service host your wallet, or at least don't let it generate your key for you.

BitCoins are not owned in the traditional sense. They're accessed using a private key. They're not tied to any identity. So anyone who has the key can be considered the owner, even if they cracked the key.

Yeah, but a house is registered to an owner. I can file a police report with proof that the house is mine, because I have a title with my name, SSN, etc. BTC is anonymous.
  


No, you need the private key. Private key is a cryptographic term.


prove his ownership of his Bitcoins.
The private key *proves* ownership in a cryptographic currency, which is why it's the original owner's responsibility to choose a secure one.

Lol theft... The whole point of Bitcoin is that you can't prove that anyone owns it except whoever knows the key. If they know the key, it's theirs.
