He's a living meme though (unfortunately)

This is a crappy justification for fees and just evidence that blockchain technology can't work in the long run.  Bribing people to secure the network is simply wasteful spending when there's an alternative way to secure a financial system without the bribe.

Uh Tangle?

Honestly, if IOTA's main problem is that it needs a lot of transactions to be functional, that is barely even a problem at all. 
 Not only is that problem easily solvable through simple adoption, but the need for adoption actually creates a symbiotic relationship in which the network improves as more people join it, and more people join the network as it improves. If IOTA reaches widespread adoption, then the main concern I see at the point would be global financial dependence on continuous IOTA transactions.  In other words, the biggest challenge facing IOTA today (efficiency and security relying on adoption) could create a scenario of exponential growth, followed by an almost accidental locking in of IOTA as a new global currency because as money enters the network the best way to secure that money is to use the network.
As an aside, each time I think about IOTA and its implications, the more I think its creators are absolute geniuses, and it's possible that they have released a protocol that will change the world in ways that Satoshi could only dream of.

The fact that we refer to bitcoin as "Bitcoin" (capital B) and everything else as "alt-coins" suggests to me that Bitcoin has already won the public awareness battle. That doesn't mean Bitcoin is THE ONLY crypto with a chance to become the new global standard, but it certainly gives it an edge.

I think you're in crypto for good reasons, but make sure you thoroughly research the strengths and limitations of blockchain before concluding that Bitcoin is the answer to what you're looking for.

Litecoin is the front runner for now, but only until it hits the same scaling issues all blockchain coins face.  If you're in the crypto space because you are looking for something with potential to become a true alternative to our current financial system, then your best bet long term is IOTA.  Bitcoin + *maybe* a couple other blockchain coins could gain mainstream acceptance as 21st-century stores of value, but blockchain coins fundamentally cannot function as currencies due to their method of securing the network.  At least that's my two cents.

Technology's moving fast these days.  I wouldn't worry about bitcoin vs. old modes of exchange.  I'd worry about new crypto technology.

The meme is supposed to represent different methods of approaching a fundamental concept, with the "utility" or "ingenuity" of the method improving each time.  So if the concept is "simulating a face to face conversation," the meme would go something like snail mail --&gt; telephone call --&gt; skype chat.
The meme OP posted doesn't come close to following this pattern and I'm not sure what it's trying to convey--here are more and more convoluted ways of securing your bitcoin?  But to be honest memes often gradually lose their initial purpose/meaning as they're spread to more and more people, kinda like a game of telephone.  I feel sort of ridiculous analyzing memes to this degree but here we are.
