It sounds like a reasonable and fair compromise moving forward.  Is there any other solution that would have as much if not more support than this? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:07:47
Ok no probs, I guess I misunderstood. :)

I think you just lost all credibility, can you please explain how Shadowcash faked its blockchain?  And where did you pull this 80% ninja mined emission figure from?

Well its not anonymous. It seems they have given up on that idea.

Sorry, I watched the preview and was real keen to watch the whole thing but I couldn't find an option to pay in bitcoin and do that.

I had a similar problem years ago with my mother in her business.  No mum, you have to learn to read and reply to your own emails.  After 10 years she can comfortably do that now, everything else on computers is still a challenge.

Okay the cop that complained about it might not have been a federal cop, so I got that wrong.  Maybe he put a spanner in their works and is probably be grilled or demoted as we speak lol.

There are already workable solutions to these problems as some alt coins have developed encrypted blockchains making them opaque.  I am not saying that any alts will surpass bitcoin but they can at the very least be a proof of concept.

You might b surprised to learn that countries with "free or national" health care actually spend less per head of population than the US does.  Mainly because there is not a shitload of companies (hospitals and such) trying to make a metric shitload of profit of peoples miseries.

For coffee there is cash.  For anything morally objectionable anywhere, there is bitcoin.

Maybe they are waiting for the price to drop before they send them.

If the shadow devs can do it then i am sure the bitcoin devs can.

Yeah I got some good stuff man, anyway I guess I have not been keeping up with things lately.

It would be if we could pay in bitcoin to watch this.  Fail
I don't mean the doco is a fail I was referring to my inability to pay in btc to watch it, but it appears we will be able to do that soon.  :)
