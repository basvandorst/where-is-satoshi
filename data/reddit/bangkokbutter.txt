*literally a conscious being living in a universe created from nothing over billions of years. dinosaurs megalodons and megafauna and shit have lived and died for entire eras before us. civilizations and entire nations have been wiped out through war famine and other crap of the sort. one human in one nation on one continent in one city is typing his thoughts into a digital worldwide network more than likely from a device he can store in his pocket connecting to other people doing the same all made possible through transmitting digital signals to machines orbiting the globe within a matter of seconds believes a digital currency named bitcoin will never be a world currency.*
sure it will. it already is.
