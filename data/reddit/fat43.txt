I'm having the same issue but I will give them the benefit of the doubt (for now) as these last weeks have been crazy with people trying to get on the Crypto Train. 
It is however unacceptable that they don't make a public announcement explaining their situation and putting people's minds at rest. 8 days, no human replies and substantial (for me) funds locked in their exchange. As soon as I can transfer my funds, I'm out of there.
One of the worst exchange experiences I've had.

I see I got confused by this comment " If there's no good suggestions anytime soon, we're going to post the Twelfth word. " and I saw the 12th word is APOLOGY on the beta page but didn't realise it was another puzzle...  
Anyway this is good news for me I think as I've been working on both words. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:09:45
If there is a keyword the same date can represent 2 different letters. APOLOGY is the 12th word and yet there are only 6 dates with 12 next to it. There's only 1 date with a 10 which is puzzling not to mention the 13 and 14 also with one date. Maybe they are part of a key?
Edit: Also ESCAPE the 6th word only has 5 dates which is why I asked about the repeated letter being dropped.

Do your underpants have smarties on them? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:46:52
and ...
* are repeated letters in seed words only represented once? APOLOGY and ESCAPE seem to have one missing each in the cipher.
* Is there keyword for a Vigenere Cipher and can it be found in the cipher?

My question is, can this be solved without any clues whatsoever apart from the white paper and the image?
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:19:06
Yeah I'm going to have a go, but that solution is for CPU and uses JavaScript so GPUs aren't going to help.

I appreciate your point but my online banking has very good security even with my user, pass no one can send money without a code card. Banks aren't the devil they just look after themselves.

Bitcoin is still very much some kind of Voodoo in Spain . A lot of people still convert back to pesetas when referring to money. I've been trying to get my friends to see that bitcoin is the way forward... The last few days have been making that difficult. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:32:59
Yeah, and I think round numbers to an extent.  All my other transfers were not round numbers.
 I've made a few transfers in the last few weeks so maybe I was flagged for that. Anyway I'm kind of blown away that they called me that late at night.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:22:58


I've been down a similar path to you it seems and have thought the same thing many times.
Getting a letter from each date seemed to be the way to go for me using a key to reveal one word in the 67 long string, maybe the last word being the key for the next.
But then how do you get the first word? I thought the repeated dates would give us that but no matter how I tried I couldn't get a word from them.
I've tried (yyyy+mm+dd) (+-) number) mod26 and all kinds of variations and using  vigenere  keys like FREE, AZBOOKMAKERS, ESCAPE, and the output letters from the repeated dates.
I've also tried getting a letter from the weekday plus the number  e.g Thursday =MOD(CODE(T)-65+5,26) = 24 = Y
Maybe it is just really simple and we're all over thinking it.

Yes, I gave a friend 0.2btc when it was worth about 200. He backed up the wallet but can't remember the password.
I've tried to brute force it but he can't even remember length or digit letter combination...so not really crackable.

Yes, we could be wrong but if they're marketing a new business of crypto gift cards why use a different system for this? 
It's the only thing I can find which points to a length of seed. (correct me if I'm wrong)
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:45:38
I've been looking through Crypto Greeting's website for clues. Their gift cards have wallet qr codes so you can load up btc on them. In the instructions of how to get the btc out of the card they suggest Bread or Copay wallets which ask for a 12 word seed to restore. I think this could be a good reason to believe that this puzzle is a 12 word seed.
