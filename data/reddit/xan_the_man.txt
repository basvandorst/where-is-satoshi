How do you refer to smaller parts though? Like if I own 0.00065871 Bitcoin? What is that? 6micro coins?

Thanks! It's such an exciting time for crypto currency. Wish I'd bit the bullet and did some studying up a long time ago, when I had cash to invest. I'm dealing with it as a hobby for now, not putting anything more than a couple of bucks in. The hard part I find is deciding when to buy. Do I wait for a huge drop, but stand to miss out on the teary climb?

Looks like a reverse funnel system.

I'm very new at this and not in the US so my options are limited. Was recommended Luno, which supports my local currency, South African Rand, are there better options out there? I'm simply looking to get a foot in the door. I've put a couple bucks in already.

Thanks. Now I'm more confused, lol

Cool, yeah. So 100,000,000 Satoshi is one Bitcoin?

Ahh ok. That's what I thought. But if I get this right, aren't there a lot of people waiting for the initial drop after such large number of sales? Will it definitely drop?

Noob here. I've heard a lot about the 20k wall? What does this entail? That too many people have sell orders around 20k so when it hits it'll drop way down immediately?

We are in that same ship.

Pirating! What else?
