I'm ready to start investing in Shrimpcoin now.

It's always nice to hear another side of the story.

Good to hear!  I'll run through the sidebar and see what I can find.  Know of any quick online srcs to make a few bucks so I can trying some of these out?  Surveys or something simple?

I've been studying to be a sys admin for quite a bit of my life.  Just got a great job out in NM.  Loving it.  Thanks.

That's what I'm thinking.  I can't believe that I made it from being homeless, to panhandling, to landing this job with the help of an amazing friend, to now actually considering **investments**!  I have two more weeks before I have a check that I get to use regularly.  I just hope the price doesn't go up between now and then!  It's painful enough waiting for the first paycheck on a job 3 weeks about -- but the payoff is going to be sooo worth it.  I have everything itemized out until this Friday, at which point I make my first purchase and my wallet that I've had for years finally breaks 
BTC 0.000000000.
BTW any legitimate ways to get paid or make money in BTC?  Contract IT work or even just plain data entry?  Wouldn't mind doing that just to be working with transactions and familiarizing.

Interesting, is mining totally out of the question, even with someone with the infrastructure and resources/finances to start it up?  I'm sure there is already excellent written material on this.

Thanks, I know I sound like I'm bragging but for the first time in a long long time I'm actually proud of myself.  I'm excited for the future and I feel like I can start to help others and return the favor I have received.
For most people, that would be a shocking number (50-90%) but I have seen how reliable BTC has been, especially over time, and that's what I'm leaning toward.  I just wish there was more real world acceptance.  Online purchasing is great, but sometimes you want what you want when you want it hah.
