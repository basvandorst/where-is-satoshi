I see this yearly cycle talk, and the main difference here is that we just had a major parabolic move in crypto, BTC 20k! Thats massive. These kinds of gains need to be absorbed so we can continue higher, the coming bear markt will do this. Now a bear market doesnt mean the end to crypto's it just means a long down trending market. BTC is showing this, if you know about market cycles and have been investing long enough you'll understand this. I dont see many, any, crypto people talking about this. But if your new to investing, you have to understand markets never go straight up. They do rise and they do fall, right now were in a long boring decline that isnt done, we havent seen a bottom yet!

You have to go on their slack channel. Thats how my account was re-enabled. I made a video of it because it was a huge pain in the ass.

No spreads actually. You pay the horrible fees from coinbase with market orders but with limit orders you can be .00001 out of the market and pay 0 fees. I tried daytrading some ETH today on it and it was hard when there were large blocks selling to get any free trades in.

Ethereum is the same way, Its been between $10 and $20 difference all day long. The other exchanges arent nearly that far apart. I saw for 4 minutes 300 just sit there on ETH and get sold/bought. I cant see any real person just buying ETH for 4 straight minutes, my thoughts is that its the exchange getting rid of a larger position prior to the selloff under 300, which occured. Honestly Im looking to get away from the Coinbase family. Coinbase itself has crazy high fees and unfortunately it looks as if we ALL pay this price and learn the hard way. I sold $10k of Ethereum and paid 3%! Fucking Scam company IMHO. 
I dont mind them charging fees and making money but come on 3%, I can buy and sell US stocks all day long for $5, even a million dollars worth if I want. I know they are different and stock brokers make their money in different ways but it just seems like a money grab for these guys.

Thanks for the suggestion, I am in GDAX actually because of that transaction. Its fees are definitely reasonable, free is pretty reasonable. But alot of people will just use Coinbase and thats sad, if they can give away limit transactions then they can give people reasonable prices on Coinbase. I think its like bait and switch, without the bait part. Just bad.
