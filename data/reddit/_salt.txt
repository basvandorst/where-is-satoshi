in quebec it's close to 100%.
well, not really, but it feels like it
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:02:40
dude i sat next to a shit log the other day and i'm pretty sure a dead homeless guy.  nobody gives a fuck.  it'll be there until the fumes from urine start to go acid on the sticker glue.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:01:14
Waiting for you to be quoted in the media. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:24:53
thank you very much. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:17:06
true. but that may be intentional, I don't think this service is catering to the tech savvy. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:59:31
Incorporate bitcoin QR with Google Glass.  Scan and make transactions at the register just by staring at the fuckin cashier.
Integrated to google wallet, of course. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:16:08
Well. Hello. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:54:31
this guy on top of his shit
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:32:09
Well the owner of Bitstamp is a 17 year old kid... so
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:33:37
pardon my ignorance - and not to be disrespectful - but what makes version 2 $100 more? 
@_date: 2014-05-03 05:09:43
You know what, people might give you shit for your 'greed and boast' but fuck that, you're killing it and I envy your initiative.  Stay strong.
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:31:08
brilliant. need a business partner?
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:21:02

@_date: 2013-12-11 02:15:56
out of stock
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:02:24
did you literally? literally. who the fuck actual says that
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:51
this place is fucking cess. what did you expect? this post in itself disappoints me. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:51:47
materials cost and 2 hours (?) labor, up to your discretion. I will buy one. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:39:16
Of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:16:27
Curious, do the people you take care of know about &amp; understand bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-16 03:20:39
satoshis bro
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:02:44
Check 5:56.  It sounds like he isn't (or won't anymore?)
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:58:31
How much did they cost?  (I read your post, I am just wondering what my donation should be if I wind.)  :)  
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:27:30
Fuck off.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:05:24
He's a good man.  
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:24:06
Hi Joshua, 
I'm very curious as to the details here.  I did notice the various drops on Coinbase and did believe it had to do with Bitstamp, after they changed their pricing algorithm.  I look forward to reading your find after you are given permission.
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:26:22
Python says EUR.
@_date: 2013-08-14 17:09:00
No, but you can skip the middle man, PayPal, and link your bank directly at coinbase.com.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:56:50
Charlotte! I can make this happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:37:46
Liberals here don't like your CCW comments.  I'm all in favor, leave that fuckers brains for the street sweeper.  I'm always armed when Local BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:04:00


"hey reddit, i'm still cool, right?"
fucking liberals
@_date: 2013-09-25 03:06:47
Not sure how I ended up on this thread, but I read your response and then looked at your name... "Ah, lalicat!"  I don't know you, but you're someone that I continue to respect.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:40:15
It is their right.
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:49:39
Aka, whomever can claim the 50 coin did it.  It's a trap. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:54:48
judging by the comments, people are so unwilling to learn something new.  I wish upon them fiscal collapse. 
the skateboarding comment was not necessary. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:40:24
then stop buying bitcoins dumbass
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:27:41
More importantly, lubeplease hasn't already been taken?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:28:47
Don't worry about it. Middle school teachers are usually pretty stupid and never got a real degree/just got drunk throughout college. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:55:12
if you're serious about a side job like this I'm sure people would pay a premium for different metals, not just aluminum. you'd have to be the judge on your mill and drill bit capabilities but damn these could look very nice. I am interested. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:38:48
And they shouldn't.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:31:37
i bought a few from bfl... had to put them down after they proved unprofitable 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:59:06
are you fucking dumb? read the op again. moron
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:02:00
Yes, please.  Try Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:00:06
Yes, lets associate bitcoin more so with drug use.
@_date: 2013-09-19 14:21:27
Sorry, but confusing as hell.
If they have any hot, hot, hot jerky consider me sold.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:00:51
Thanks for the link.  Fox news did a great job.  Seemed to be pretty fair... I have a feeling it will be a lot better than CNN's in a few hours.
Ron Paul: "I will not be buying any bitcoins"
Fine.  I will find you RP and I will give you one instead.
Edit:  CNN's:       
(CNN really has gone to shit...)
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:05:21
but why?
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:36:20
well you haven't lost anything until you sold. you still have 185 coin which is more than most. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 00:40:53
Bitcoin only.... says the dollar bill tucked away in the right.
Fuck yo post it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:04:34
You don't watch TV... but you already formed your opinion on Fox.  It's not that bad.
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:18:56
what the fuck are you expecting us to do? feel bad for you? this is the dumbest shit I've read in a fucking week. are you in middle school? 
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:06:58
Except they disabled comments...
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:39:36
a clip on TV?  was this through the news or some sort of promotion?  do you happen to have a copy of the clip?  thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:06:12
apologies, English is not my primary language. I understand I need to better understand american poor grammar use 
@_date: 2013-09-13 14:56:18
Surprised you didn't continue to milk the exploit &amp; perhaps even sell the information to people the exact times you were going to drop the price.
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:39:20
I tried getting them to do it almost a year ago so glad to see I'm not the only one.  They gave me the standard 'not at this time'. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:05:09
Oh Mark Williams, you have ashamed Boston University.  Good to know their business school is shit.
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:24:11
You know what, I've had my Arduino Mega just sitting in storage... I'm going to do this!  Great idea - thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:01:49

@_date: 2013-10-18 04:51:50
