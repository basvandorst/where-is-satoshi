Have some karma - if he hasn't PM'd you yet, he included ticket numbers in the OP as  and 
Go get some hacker!

Yeah, don't know what sort of aftershock though.  Not sure whether to buy/sell off the bat.

Hmm, there's already an open source miner for the Cyclone IV EP4CE115 that gets 80MH/s per chip, you could easily make a board filled with them for $500 to get around 4 on a board (with $100 overhead on other components).  That's 320MH/s, with hardly any power costs at all, if you can code in the RPC into a dodgy cheap microcontroller to handle reporting of shares instead of having a computer on 24/7.
The trading industry isn't in FPGA's because they don't make money out of generating blocks like us.
Anyway, source for open source FPGA miner:
There are 13 forks off the main branch, and a couple of forks off subsequent forks - it is a real workable solution that's been proved.

unless you have 1000 btc, then it is huge :D

Yeah, I just made 170% of what I own in bitcoin out of this dip, managed to sell just as the massive order happened.

Most applications/bots use the websocket at mtgox to get up to date market depth and trades, let's hope the other exchanges implement something as simple to use as that.

Awesome, thanks!  I've got a new trade data window for my trade monitor, you're a legend!

Yay, got mine accepted on second go, thanks MtGox_Adam and MagicalTux!

Can you add a checkbox or something that will add the 0.65% fee on top of the exchange rate for you?  I've done this on my conky one, but it'd be cool for this :)
@_date: 2011-06-12 03:35:14
thanks! It really just makes it easier for daytrading when it's pre-adjusted for you.
(also, loving the climbs and dives at the moment, have made 20BTC in the last hour!)

50MH/s without a heatsink at all, 80MH/s with a heatsink - I'm assuming more if you can watercool the things.
Trading industry using FPGAs for what though?  Genetic algorithms?

I agree, luckily after about 10 hits of refresh using the API sell url, I managed to sell at $19.  Do you know any PHP?  If so, you can easily implement a "Sell" button on your own site that you can spam in the event of a slide.

I sold 23.25 BTC at $19.98/BTC as it was massively dropping (managed to get the sell in) - got $464.54 out of that.  A few minutes later it was at $13/BTC.
I then bought 40 BTC at $11.6, then a few minutes later it was back to $13/BTC, I sold all 40 back, got $520.60 out of that, then it went back down to $10.50 where I bought 49.581 BTC...
Now MtGox is down. :(
But hey, a 30~ BTC gain within an hour or two is pretty damn good luck!
@_date: 2011-06-24 10:58:58
Yeah, mine got kicked back too.  Couldn't think of much more proof to give other than my username, old password and email address..  So I gave them pretty much everything I could ever think of that related to my mtgox account, let's hope second round works well...

If you learn to jump that jumprope, you could be a millionaire :D
