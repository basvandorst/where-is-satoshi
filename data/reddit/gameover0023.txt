Im providing different analysis than coinmarketcap. While marketcap only shows you the last 24 hours and change in % up or down. It doesnt list movements of the coins up and down the chart, and doesnt track em ona day to day and weekly changes. Mine is kinda like a power ranking while also anazling marketcap on a day to day basis, and the movement of coins up and down the chart. Its just going to be a tool to easier track to see if coins are going up and down the charts. 
For example, if a coin is moving up the ranks everyday youd be able to see it alot easier on my website because ill tell you this week ___ coin moved up 7 spots. 
I will be doing a weekly summary too and a change in marketcap and movement of all the coins during the week and daily.
Its still under contruction and its the first day. Im new to blogging and will be updating and enhancing the blog as i improve my skills. If you find the data usefull you can donate if you want to. if not its okay. Either way i just want people to use it to track coins movements on the charts on a day to day or week basis.

Thanks alot man. And yea i realized that. Im not going to be proving charts but coinmarketcap is excellent for that as well as cyrptocharts.info
Im not trying to compete with these sites just provide further info that they might have overlooked or go more in depth in some aspects. As well as the ranking system.
