Your comment about the .6% daily growth got me curious as to what the price would be if that growth stayed the same for the next year. Results came to 20k on Christmas, and 168k a year from now. You heard it here first folks. On a serious note though, I do wonder how long it will be until things slow down and we have less volitity. On one hand, there's still huge room for adoption,  but on the other hand, the technology isn't ready yet for mass adoption.

I see your point,  but a lot of these people were early adopters and helped support btc back when nobody knew about it. I'm happy for them to take some profit,  and I'm sure a lot of then are still holding some amount. There's no guarantee that btc will last long term, and with the crazy growth in the last year,  I can't really blame anyone for getting out while they're ahead.

My best advice regarding this, and really all aspects in life is to not dwell on the past. The cliche "hindsight is 20/20" is a cliche for a reason. There was no way to know that we'd be at where we are today, and if it all goes to 0 tomorrow, you would be relieved you didn't waste your money. If you truly believe in bitcoin long term,  than you should take u/21000000coins 's advice and buy in now, because its never too late 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:34:38
Well it sounds like you have enough to spare, and the amount you're cashing out's going to a good cause. Personally I'm expecting a huge dip coming soon, because even though im elated about these highs, the fact is the price is double what it was a month ago. I'm bullish on btc long-term,  but this just feels crazy
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:19:54
Considering the price is up 20% in the last 24 hours, I'd say it's actually a good day to cash out

One of the reasons I got into BTC is because I was afraid of my country facing an economic crisis similar to Greece. Good luck friend

Bitcoin is dead. We were at 19k earlier today, and dropped to 15k. /s

I dont talk to many people about it, and even my wife doesn't know how much I have. It just seems a lot simpler that way, although whenever someone brings it up, I geek out and talk to them about it until theyre sick of me. I do have certain price points (still  a long way off) where I'll cash out small amounts and take a profit just for safety, but I'll always hold most of my btc, because the whole reason I got in was for revolutionizing money, and I feel like I'd be literally selling out if I sold for fiat. I'm a real believer in the matrix memes

Not saying you're wrong, but I was sitting at my computer this morning watching gdax, and saw it hit 19k
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:45
I really want to spend my btc more, but the truth is that it's really hard to justify spending right now. I mean I just woke up to find that btc jumped from 14k to 16k while I slept.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:14:15
At the beginning of this year my conservative prediction for the end of the year was 2k, and even a couple months ago it was 10k. My conservative estimate for the end of next year is 60-100k. Hopefully my prediction ends up just as conservative next year as it was this year lol

Honestly, one coin is already unobtainable for me. I had a plan to buy a little every paycheck, but the price rises faster than I can keep up with.

Nobody really knows. My personal feelings are that this crazy run we've seen the last few weeks are because of whales pumping the price, so that they can short it. But I  guess we'll see.

That makes sense. I've been buying small amounts the last couple weeks just incase it's approved, but if it gets rejected I'm gonna buy quite a bit during the dip

I don't remember the year, but I read an article about it on some tech website when it was roughly $2/btc. I remember being slightly intrigued but didn't understand it and ended up dismissing it. I like playing around with new technologies, and I considered buying $20 worth just to see what I could do with it. In the end I didn't bother because I didn't consider it "real" money. I wondered how mining bitcoin could just create money out of thin air. I try not to think about that too much now. 
I forgot about it almost immediately,  and it wasn't until 2016 when it came back on my radar. I was starting to get interested in economics and was seeing the signs of a coming crash so I started researching how i could protect my money. I stumbled upon bitcoin again, but this time it made more sense to me and it was exactly what i was looking for, and more. I haven't looked back.

I didn't see this posted anywhere so I thought I would share. I was wondering what others thought about their analysis in the article that led them to conclude that Gavin is most likely Satoshi Nakomoto. If it were true, what do you think that could mean for bitcoin?

"Coinbase confirmed to CoinDesk that, while the total number of global accounts is 3 million, not all of them fall into the scope of the IRS request. The cryptocurrency exchange indicated it is not currently sharing the exact number of potentially impacted accounts."
3 million is global, not just the US.

I've thought about doing this, but wouldn't I have to pay taxes on the profit? It seems like it would be a hassle to keep track of if you were using it every day, and then the taxes themselves would be a killer if you were using bitcoin that you haven't held for at least a year (if you live in the US).

I used to think that people who said this were just buzzkills. I was prepared for the 9000 memes and I don't mind people being excited, but as the price increases, I can feel the stakes increasing and find myself wondering if I got myself caught up in a joke. I crave Andreas posts because they remind me why I got started here in the first place. I've only been here a year, so I can only imagine what long term holders are feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:21:30
I've been thinking about doing this but how do you deal with the taxes you'll have to pay on the profit? If you're using it often I feel like it would be a real pain keeping track of everything
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:17:02
I'm not OP, but I have similar feelings. Basically, everyone has their own number when they're ready to sell. I don't have a lot, but the magic number for me is $100k. I like to hedge my bets, and at that point, I'll have a crazy profit margin, and would be compelled to sell some. It's the price point for me where I could feel like I really made a good and profitable decision, and if I didn't sell some I think I would go crazy everytime the price dipped, knowing that I haven't actually made any profit yet. That being said, I'm a big believer in bitcoin long term, and will never sell my entire holdings.
To come up with your own number, you have to think about when people ask investors "how much are you willing to lose?" At a certain price, you have to think "if bitcoin went to 0 tomorrow, am I ok with that, or will I regret not selling when I had the chance?" If I sold at 100k, it would be enough to help increase the quality of life for my family and still leave enough BTC for even more potential growth. At that point, BTC could hit $0, or $1M, but my anxiety would be eased because at least I had something to show for it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:29:13
Because you didn't put in more than you were willing to lose

I had chips and dip as a cheat "meal" last night. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:44:05
Oh, I plan on still having enough to enjoy when it hits $1M. $100K is just the first price point where I'm willing to sell SOME. My whole reasoning is that at 100k I can sell enough to make a worthwhile profit, and not have to sit in worry about the price. I'll still have enough to be a very happy man when it hits $1M
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:32:04
Honestly I hope she's right. If it drops that far I'll finally be able to afford a full coin. I'm sure the price would bounce right back as people would jump at the opportunity to get coins on sale
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:29:15
You should definitely sell it to me. I didnt buy nearly enough during the dip
