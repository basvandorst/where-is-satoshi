Sound promising, but why the broken SSL certificate?

I have not used LBC for a few months, but last time as soon as I logged in and activated my advertisements, I received an email. It said my account was flagged as fraudulent, and I should log in and activate it. It had what looked like a localbitcoins address. When I clicked on it, I knew it was a hack, as the address was not localbitcoins.com. 
Long story short, did you click on the link on the email from "maicobrigs" and "log in" to localbitcoins from your iPhone? If so, that's exactly how they did it, especially as on the iPhone it may be more difficult to tell you were going into a trojaned LBC website.

Ugh, I was thinking of buying another Trezor, but now I'm wondering what to do with the one I have. I'm not going to put BTC on it if SL is going to operate like this.

Paypal, Bitcoin, yadayada, someone show me an actual merchant accepting Bitcoin thanks to PayPal and/or Braintree, please. Until then, I don't wanna hear it.

Okay, here is a crazy idea for the near future:
* You fill up your mobile wallet with Bitcoins.
* You go to your local Coffee shop, yeah that one that still doesn't accept Bitcoins.
* They ring you up for $37 for your espresso, awesome.
* The register accepts Mastercard paypass (or whatever payment protocol your phone supports), so you swipe your phone over the terminal.
* Behind the scenes, your Bitcoin wallet generates a masked CC for the amount of the purchase.
* The wallet pays for the coffee using this masked CC.
* Achievement unlocked!

So what can someone outside of China do with oklink cny? Anything other than deposit into okcoin China?
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:10:59
I assume you can generate the CC's using the website, but I have not tried it yet.

I like this idea, but the subscription service can't be paid by bitcoin, ugh.

Sideways on good news? Insanely bullish!

I think the merchant would still have a base value in a local currency. Until BTC is less volatile they would not price them directly in Bitcoins, so there would be no point. By the time that changes, we may not need credit cards.

Cool, it's amazing how many charities are accepting Bitcoin, but I'm sure there's a lot more that could!

This looks really cool, can you spare an invite? Thanks!
