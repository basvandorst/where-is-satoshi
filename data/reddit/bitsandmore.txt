I can feel you. I did hold every. single. BTC I mined back in 2012 which is really good BUT i did invest 30k into this ICO back in 2014 and turned it into 150k when i sold all of my ETH for $1... SMH... :) Its human nature gentlemen... and ladies...

Very proud, I had a similar experience once many years ago. I wanted to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock. I read the book "The Buffett Way" and i loved his vision. But his stock was $5,000 and I said there is no way I can afford a stock that is $5,000... Today it is trading at $291,500! I was able to afford 10 shares at the time. No chance I can do that now!

I have been waiting and hoping for a BitFury chip to become available to the general public. Fuck KNC and the "pre sale" thief's out there. BitFury will deliver legit and on time. I for one cant wait to get my hands on some of their new gear!

Very exciting news for the entire Bitcoin Ecosystem... Once BitFury makes this tech available to the masses people everywhere will once again be able to mine for the foreseeable future...

Marshall, do you think there is anything that can/should be done to "de-centralize" mining again? It will never be like in the old days but with 3 or 4 major manufacturers running massive data centers what are your thoughts on solving this issue?

Thanks for sharing, really interesting story...

The answer is very simple as to "what's driving this?" The price has increased from the $230's to the $400's. There are multiple large manufacturers (Bitmain, KNC, BitFury) with X number of ultra high efficiency (.25 down to .06 announced) J/Gh/s so it is simply a math formula. You need not add 50 aMW of power you can simply replace older inefficient machines with newer efficient machines. ALso remember BitFury previously announced a 100 aMW facility who knows if this is coming on line as we write this...

not to argue but a couple months ago I transferred 2 BTC from my Cryptsy account to my Coinbase account with no issues also. I had heard the rumors but since I still had just a few BTC worth of Alts in my account i didnt really concern myself. I wound up waiting until about a month ago. My BTC is gone from my Cryptsy account and it is NOT in my Coinbase account. THe BTC is gone. I have emailed support multiple times and no reply... I assume my $ is gone...

The coins have been out of my account for over a week but they have never been transfered to my wallet. I opened a ticket, received a reply from support but after I replied to show proof of the request and the withdrawel I have heard nothing... At this point it looks like I am out a couple of BTC..

I want to share a story about a "Dr" I once dealt with. We moved from Atlanta to Cali in the 90's and we had to rent our house in Atl. applications, etc and we finally rent to Dr. Blankity Blank.. A couple months into the lease agreement we call the Dr. house and his friend answers the phone. ME: Hi can i talk to Dr. Blankity FRIEND: Who? ... OH hahahaha ya sure excuse me "DOCTOR" you have a phone call... needless to say about a month or so later the rent check bounces. Im not saying the new "DR" is a fraud but...

I have been playing with Cryptsy for a couple months, have heard this and was hoping it was wrong. I was able to trade out of some Alt's and get BTC sent. But as of yesterday I have not heard a word (have a ticket in) and have not received the 3 BTC that I am owed... Looks like its over... UGH... Does anyone know of any Alt exchanges that are legit?

THe reality is the true future of Bitcoin mining will be determined in the next few months. Why you ask? Because today BitFury has completely rewritten the process with their new chip. It is so much more efficient EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL MINER IS DONE! Now one of two things will happen. 
1. BF keeps 100% of its hardware and continues to build out massive Data Centers in Georgia.
2. BF sells its hardware to individuals.
If BF does  Bitcoin will become fully centralized and there is nothing you and I can do about it. However if BF does what they say they will do and sell to consumers then Bitcoin mining becomes DEcentralized... Lets hope for

@_date: 2014-11-01 20:04:03
There is something for everyone to remember. WHen we think of the price of BTC it should have NEVER been anywhere near $1000-$1200 we all got carried away but the willy bot and the Mt. Gox scammers artificially pumped the price from where it should have been (assume last year October and maybe a nice bump from the good news") but the bottom line is there are still not "millions of new users looking to buy BTC" so while we all hope for the $10k in 3 year scenario I am very confident 1k in 3 years would still be super positive. Maybe 10k in 10 years, who knows but lets not worry about the price, it is probably about where it should be (taking away willy bot pump) and lets watch the exciting things happening in 2014 like PAYPAL, DELL, and the hundreds of millions invested by the some of the smartest VC's in the world. Look at the positive and don't worry about the pumped up price. Lets keep telling all our friends to buy ONE bitcoin and hold it for 10 years. Lets show people how easy it is to trade, spend, etc and not focus on short term "1 year" price increases or decreases! VIVA LA BIT!

Guys let an older member explain why this is a GOOD idea. When the Internet was just getting off the ground there were no "Internet" ads on tv. The ads were for "etrade" and pets.com, etc... It did not matter whether these became successful companies because THEIR promotion was what brought middle America onto the Internet. When companies like Coinbase, Kraken, Circle, etc begin running television advertising to get people to visit their web sites THEN main street will start to understand and believe in it. Until then it will be "fringe" I do not expect Roger Ver or rich guys to just spend money advertising like "Doge" did it should be companies going after consumers. Where are the company advertising budgets for customer acquisition???
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:43:51

Coastermonger one other thought is I promised to explain to these guys about Gox as well as some of the other negatives. (I have already sent him stories from AAntonopolis, Andreessen, etc) and he is absolutely sold. We had this meeting planned for over a month when freaking Gox blows up. Can you give me your thoughts on Russia, the overall "hacking" or as my guys call it "stealing" of coins. again they are not worried for the protocol it is more "political" to help them sell to the owners its a positive for the franchise

We own and operate several Bitcoin "ATM" (note we call them vending machines) We can take care of your licensing issues if you want to purchase one. We can also manage and run the machine. Here are the rough numbers.
1. We own and operate a Robocoin at the "D" hotel in Las Vegas First month was over $150k in gross volume (buys and sales) 
2. We operate (for other 3rd party owners) a Lamassu, a Bit Access, a Genesis1, in different locations. These machines are brand new locations and are trending roughly 100k per month each. 
The bottom line is with a "Great" location you can probably ROI in 3 months average. In a "Good" location you can ROI in 6 months,, in a poor location it would probably take 12 months. I would like to give you my email but I am not sure if its cool reddit etiquette because it sounds like a sales pitch. So instead I will say if you have more questions on this email the contact US at  and ask for Scott 
PS. we are HUGE believers in Bitcoin and we believe if we can help place BTC machines throughout the world we will help more newbs get access to BTC

2014 has been an AMAZING year for bitcoin... Take away the price and ask yourself if one year ago you would have heard that Paypal, Dell, Expedia, etc.. plus another 250MM in investment into bitcoin (more than Internet circa 1994) I a sure you would have said this is great news! and it is. Dont worry about price, it will be there but maybe several more years for more consumers to catch up to the tech...

Other than Coindesk and here we really dont have a great solution for advertising the atm locations.

When thinking about whether or not to accept Bitcoin I think you should understand an extremely important variable. The amount of "Goodwill" that the millions of BTC users would have towards Wikipedia/Wikimedia now and in the future. This is hard to calculate but it is potentially huge. When you realize that a retail business like Overstock announcing over $1MM per month in BTC sales and growing pretty much the moment they begin accepting it speaks volumes. Chances are soon BTC will be accepted alongside Visa/MC as a standard alternative payment method. If you wait until then to accept it you will lose 100% of this potential goodwill. It is hard to understand it but if you choose to accept BTC early (IE: 2014) you will be glad you did now and for years to come...

Obviously this kid was a little nervous and overwhelmed by the situation. For those of you who have never dealt with this type of "interview" it is a great opportunity but its not easy. He was clearly not prepared and he came off to me as trying his best but not the right guy. Here is what I would love to hear people say when asked the question "Why would I want to use it when I can send a wire transfer?" 1. Show them how much easier it is than a wire transfer. 2. Show them that instead of paying $30 to send that transfer it costs $0 and then most importantly. Remind him what many of us still believe is the most valuable asset (and the reason why most of us reading this own BTC) There are only EVER going to be 21 million of these bitcoins. In 10 years from now when my $1 dollar is worth .75 cents I am VERY confident that the Bitcoin i have saved will be worth MORE than it is today. Therefore it is a prudent move to take a SMALL amount of my savings and put some into BTC. (This will move the conversation into an area where we have better answers than security, theft, etc..) If anyone is reading this who will be interviewed DONT give price quotes and estimates! Just get the information out there that we believe it will be worth more than today. Thats all people need to understand. Buy a bitcoin now. It will be worth more in the future. Lets stay on point guys!

This scammer is the worst of the worst. It is like a playbook for how to rip off consumers.
1. Start a "cloud mining" service. Pay 2x-5x ANY real BTC pool payouts to the first "pyramid" err... investors.
2. When mining difficulty begins to crater (completely flat for the first time in history) and you are no longer able to support the Ponzi/Pyramid quickly pivot the business.
3. What an idea! START A NEW COIN AND GET INVESTORS TO "MINE" THOSE!
The greed of people never ceases to amaze me...  
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:45:23
This argument is so inherently wrong. I cant believe how little you understand about the economics of mining... You are talking about the "vast majority" of price appreciation. When you are taking price from .001 to say $100 it is 10,000x appreciation. YES that is the vast majority. However the amount of electricity used to mine during this early stage is negligible.  Today with prices in the $100-$1,000 range and difficulty 1000X what it was. Electricity is now the MAJORITY of the cost. To keep it as simple as possible to understand 2 years ago miners HELD their coins. Today with the cost of mining miners SELL their coins. We need consumer adoption/investor interest or this downward pressure will continue.  Go Winklevii, Go Russia, Go China, Go BTM, etc... Nothing positive happens without Investor ETF's consumer adoption, etc. I hope the smart guys on this thread are thinking of ideas to help with adoption and not assuming "only 500k users are planning to purchase $2 per day" to make the price increase...

remember 5k x3600 per day = $18m per day... that is over .5 billion per month EVERY month.. There better be some huge buying reasons for it.. Remember the numbers... THere is light at the end of the tunnel but its probably at least 2 years out before we see any real major movement and it would be halving &amp; consumer adoption &amp; investor interest coming together... Then maybe we can see 1k-5k-10k pricing... 4 years later maybe it doubles again? My guess for 2015 is $250-$500 based on adoption.

Guys you are missing my point completely. First I AM a miner. NO we do not "dump their coins at the same time and cause a crash" THIS IS NOT A CRASH. The past several months have shown slow steady price decreases (do you agree with this?) IF you agree that there is a slow steady price decrease I am telling you a LOT of it has to do with the fact that miners (like me) can no longer keep 100% of our BTC as we used to. I have no choice other than selling the majority of my coins to pay my costs. Do you not think this affects the price? How could it not?

Danster 82. I think you are wrong. I think the price of bitcoin is driven by supply and demand. 2 years ago (after the 50/25 halving) there was exactly 3600 btc mined each day. Assume for the hell of it that a bunch of other miners like me kept 100% of our BTC (i never sold one. Still have every btc I mined) Now fast forward to today. I continue to mine but now I sell almost 90% of my BTC to pay expenses. Lets assume hundreds (thousands) of other miners are like me. How can that amount of new inventory NOT affect the price. I guess if you just dont believe in supply and demand than maybe i am wrong.. I dont think so... 
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:42:53
This is HUGE news. The increase in hash rate combined with the drop in price is causing this. If you dont have latest hardware its going to be hard to profit from mining... WHere will this lead?

see the response I gave to Dogbunny. Same answer. I buy a machine, plug in and do my best to generate BTC... If I unplug I lose 100% of my investment in that machine.. No one will "unplug"

Dont forget miners receive over 100,000 coins every month. THat is ongoing sustained pressure. Once there are users/investors looking to purchase MORE than 100k coins each month we will see price appreciation again...

@_date: 2015-01-05 05:56:22
Yes that is my point. Miners are forced to sell now due to costs associated with mining. THIS IS MY POINT&gt; THIS IS WHAT IS DRIVING DOWN THE PRICE LATELY. There may be other reasons but I never said miners manipulate. I said miners (I am a miner) are now more or less forced to sell to cover costs. If BTC prices were closer to 500 I would be selling WAY less coins than I do now. If they were 1000 per BTC I would be able to keep 80%. But at 200-300 I am basically barely able to cover the cost of the electricity. I was hoping to start a conversation and teach non miners what I believe the price dropping is related to and to see if anyone had any good thoughts.. Cant believe the responses... 
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:46:59
Jstolfi. when you say miners have "no control on the price or supply of bitcoins" it makes me wonder if you are insane... Miners have exactly 100% CONTROL OF ALL SUPPLY. Do you understand the concept of how it works? Do you want to watch a great video explaining how mining works? all of those shiny new 3600 BTC you are referring to are "mined" every one of them. Let me ask you a complex question. If all 3600 daily coins were held and ZERO WERE SOLD. do you believe the price would increase? Next if all 3600 daily coins were sold and ZERO WERE HELD do you believe the price would decrease? Jesus what the hell is wrong with the people on this thread?

@_date: 2015-01-04 21:22:32
HAHA... EXACTLY. When I mined and HELD 100% of my BTC that did not affect the prices as opposed to when I mine and SELL 80% of my BTC. Wow you are a genius spottedidiot...
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:36:01
My only discussion point is: "Why is price dropping?" I guarantee you I care every bit as much about BTC value and I am holding as many as I can afford to keep in my wallet(s) If the price were to appreciate say back to $500 I could A: pay my electricity bill (yes I live in the REAL world where electricity bills need to get paid) B: pay to acquire more mining hardware (thats not free either my genius unicorn large brained friend) but yes if BTC were trading at closer to $500 USD I would own a LOT more in my wallet.. BUt I guess you are right it is all unicorns causing the price to fall/raise. It has NOTHING to do with actual supply and demand... 
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:16:24
Great post.. The reason it is down is very simple. 
1. Supply
2. Demand
Until demand increases OR supply decreases there will be downward pressure on BTC. The Wily bot artificially "pumped" the price of BTC to $1,000 it probably never should have been that high. There is a LOT of demand for BTC around the $300 price point and there is a fixed supply. People talk about merchant downward pressure but remember every day 3,600 new BTC are created and distributed to miners. This is the equivalent of just over $1m per day or $30m each month in supply. Once demand increases to over $1m per day OR when the next halving occurs (roughly 2 years from now) the price may seriously increase. Until then as long as miners actually have to pay for hardware, electricity, etc. there will continue to be downward price pressure. But with over $300m (not including investors like Tim Draper purchasing BTC directly) there is a lot of major money in the ecosystem. Dont worry its not going away but its also not going to 10,000 until there is a LOT more demand than there is supply. THink about it. 3600 coins X $10,000 would be 36M per DAY or 1 BILLION per MONTH in demand. Lets be realistic. I doubt we will see real $1,000+ value until new supply decreases by half. But once that happens and then again 4 years later... Patience young guns... I promise if you own as many as you can and hold them you will be happy in 10 years!
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:31:04
Dogbunny, all miners buy or manufacture their own machines. Plug them into electric outlet and add hashing power to the blockchain. If I (or any other miner) unplugs a machine we just bought (or manufactured) we simply lose 100% of the value of that machine and generate that much less bitcoin. So lets assume I invested $10,000 in machines and now I own 20 of them. How many should I unplug? (Do you see what I mean?) Real world. 2 years ago. I keep 100% of my BTC. Now I spend almost 90%. I am probably the same as a LOT of other miners

Today we have Spondoolie-tech and Bitmain machines and we sell damn near every coin we get. Maybe you are right maybe I am too stupid to see the big picture that miners selling thousands of coins do NOTHING to drop the price.. whew...

Here is a simple question. Please answer it. If YOU were running a conference and Mark Karpeles offered you $10k (or 50k or whatever a "Platinum/Super shiny diamond") sponsorship costs would you allow him to present. Not just to attend but to PRESENT. When Moe is offering him a chance to "Q &amp;A" for 30 minutes thats great. Go ahead and do that. All we are asking is STOP PROMOTING HIM AS A PRESENTER. You are giving him credibility to go out and steal more money from unsuspecting newbs and young kids (Can the average age of his victims be more than 18 years old?) Refund his money, and get him off the main stage and sponsorship... It is embarrassing...

Very good article and can absolutely help noobs with a basic understanding of why NOT to mine. One interesting thing I learned about your strategy of mining that is really, REALLY negative is: You decided to set up a mining operation in the Caribbean? Really? Before you started this and came up with your strategy did you realize that heat is the  factor you need to deal with when setting up an operation? I cannot really think of a worse location on earth than where you selected to set up your operation. (I guess sub sahara Africa would probably be worse) but seriously as long as you have a very small facility which I assume you have it likely does not matter but having run a not very small facility I can tell you that the cost of the electricity is important but of far more importance is heat elimination and you need to be very careful in your facility to prevent electrical fires/dead people. But thanks for a great article! It really is good...
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:10:43
Sorry it took me so long to respond but did you really say "heat really isn't much of an issue" LOL. Now I know you have NO clue what you are talking about. Who ever told you the real issue is maingaining consistent temperatures whether they be high or low.. LOL... sorry even typing it makes me laugh. Lets start up a mining business together, since its just a decision to choose consistent temperatures ill choose super high temperatures all the time. How does that sound? LOL...

Wow what a brilliant strategy... So you can get away with only $50k in electricity... Just out of curiosity how much did you invest in order to build, install, and run 180,000 Antminer S9s? Do you know that the hard cost just on the installation of those units would cost you over $4m the cost of building these machines on the other hand is closer to $360,000,000 So your hardware and installation investment (of course you couldnt manufacturer 180,000 S9's if your life depended on it but we wont get into negative details here) Lets just keep it simple... You could spend just over $360M Plus $50k in electricity for the purpose of a "double spend" attack that would immediately be rolled back. In other words you would wind up with NOTHING and BTC would continue with the correct blockchain happily not giving a fuck about you... Please understand what the hell your talking about next time...

@_date: 2017-01-25 06:15:53
OH dan_from here we go again... The only reason many of us "attacked" you is because you made so many "wild" claims regarding your operation. Several people called you out due to some of your more outrageous claims. (Lets face it, even you must admit some of your claims are a tad bit hard to believe!) :) Now I actually AM an experienced miner and when I called you out on your "I am planning on spending $1m on mining equipment" and your "I am earning 4 BTC per year per miner" and "I am using HVAC to cool my mining operation" (Forgive me if I am mis quoting I am trying to remember the conversation) so I was one of the potential "betters" I do NOT doubt you have a greenhouse, I do not even doubt you have solar panels on your greenhouse. I do however doubt that you have any clue what you are talking about regarding mining and many of your mining statements are clearly bullshit. Other than that you seem like a nice enough guy but you should not talk about shit and promote ideas to people that you have no clue about. Long reply short: ANYONE WHO IS READING THIS DO NOT PLAN TO BUILD SOLAR GREENHOUSES IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO MINE BITCOIN! You will lose your ass. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:38:40
I hate to burst everyone's bubble here but 1. NO you are NOT generating almost 4 BTC per year from each antminer. Anyone who even continues this thread conversation from there knows as little as you apparently do. If you would like me to go into detail on this I will be happy to do it but suffice it to say "difficulty" and I will leave it at that. 2. I love your concept of "Free energy" Can you please explain exactly how much you are paying for your solar panels in order to generate this free electricity? GUYS I LOVE BTC BUT YOU ARE ALL INSANE IF YOU THINK "THIS IS THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN" Or even "this is the short-term future of bitcoin" No its not. Its one of the worst ideas I have ever heard unless your goal is to lose money. If you want to lose money please use this model. Because I am a real miner, I have electricity costs "fully baked" for below .026 and its a BITCH to break even...

Anyway around 2013 or 2014 a guy I know starts asking me questions about BTC. I am always ALWAYS helpful to friends and acquaintances when they ask for help or information and they genuinely want to understand. This guy was barely an acquaintance and he starts badgering me with the usual (remember 2013) I heard the CEO committed Suicide, They are arresting the people running it.. ETC.. So after about a minute or two of him disrespectfully asking stupid shit I just tell him "dude, just google it and read the white paper" he stops me and says "Look if you want me to buy into this stuff you need to explain it to me"...

Dan_from... I am good with your plan, but first lets clarify the bet. We are talking $100k from me and $1m from you. This is NOT a casual "bet" this is real. 
1. I HAVE the $100k in BTC and I can prove it. Can you? 
2. My bet was "you do not have a Bitcoin Mining Facility Cooled by an underwater lake and efficient HVAC system" Let me be very clear about this. 
3. I am NOT betting that "you have a greenhouse" I personally dont care if you have a greenhouse or not. What I know for a FACT is you do NOT have a "Bitcoin Mining Facility" 
4. Let me define a Bitcoin Mining Facility. It is NOT a "miner" anyone can buy an S9 and plug it in. Your claim was you were "running a mining operation" to which I call BULLSHIT! 
5. Lets define said "mining operation" a reasonable mining operation would be something on the scale of 500 kwh. Being that I helped operate a 2.0 aMW facility I am being reasonable here. Hell Lets take it down by HALF.
6. If your "mining operation" is running a minimum of 500 S9 or lower Ant Miner's I will agree that you are running a legitimate "mining operation" that is being cooled by the lake and efficient HVAC. 
7. If you are ready to make that bet you are 100% on and I will bash the fuck out of you on a post (as you request) 
If on the other hand you are just trying to bullshit people about your "mining operation" and in fact simply have a greenhouse with solar panels and have a couple of Ant Miners plugged in now is your chance to back up and wiggle out of this bet. 
Your move friend...

The moral of the story is: There are certainly large hodlers who may sell someday, some of them are old miners, some are early investors, but regardless the value will continue to be driven by the laws of supply and demand. The truth is as long as there is more demand than supply the price will continue to climb. If supply increases or demand decreases the price will drop. Dont invest more than you are willing to lose and once you do hodl on tight... Come back to this thread in 10 years and you will smile!

Its unbelievable that the NY Daily News (What a RAG) actually wrote this! "Autumn Radtke, the CEO of Bitcoin, took her own life as a result of 'the magnitude of the issues on the work and personal front,' according to the coroner." Later in the article they say "Autumn Radtke was CEO of First Meta, an Singaporean digital currency company founded in 2007."  To this day I STILL listen to people comment "oh yea the Bitcoin CEO killed HIMself..." Unbelievable but true...

I can give first hand experience at what the KNC guys did. I personally invested a large sum of fiat (Over 100k) via wire transfer to KNC. This was for delivery of the Neptunes. During this time BTC was in the $70-$90 price range. After 6 MONTHS of non delivery (after about 20 broken promises) they gave a "refund" of $100k but wait isnt that great? They didnt perform but they did refund the money they took? Here is how they did it. They refunded the 100k when BTC was near the peak price of $1,000 so in essence my personal experience with these people is.
1. They take my $
2. They do not deliver for 6 months.
3. They refund my $ but instead of refunding the value of the 100k with $100 BTC (i should have owned 1000 btc) instead they refund me with 100BTC. 
Needless to say I hope these guys get ruined with lawsuits, etc... I will continue to tell my story as often as i can...

Still amazes me that more nations have not acquired a small % of their reserves in BTC... I know that given the option I would advise Barbados or any of the dozens to hundreds of small countries to put some aside as a reserve... 
@_date: 2015-11-06 03:51:07
Dimon is an idiot but remember what he is referring to is "big picture" in other words if BTC is worth 10Billion or even 50 billion its a "blip" on the radar. His comment is more like "if you think Bitcoin is going to replace the US dollar you are wrong!" but BTC prices of 1,000 or even 5,000 is a drop in the bucket.

IF you honestly think fiat is "100% safer" you need a lesson in economics. Fiat is 100% GUARANTEED to drop in value. No other item is guaranteed to drop. (Real estate, stocks, bonds, crypto, all MAY increase in value) Some will obviously not others may but only fiat is 100% guaranteed to lose value over time... Once you understand that you will not stress...

dear waphou... When you are older than 17 and actually understand what you are talking about please give us more advice. Until then let me leave you with this. 1. whether you buy BTC at $190 or $1900 or $2900 does not matter. 2. Wake the fuck up or else when BTC is $50,000 you will be giving advice to people that its a dead cat bounce and you should have sold at $75,000.

I agree with most of the below comments regarding how BI is ANTI BTC. This is obviously true. However this article is one of the most positive articles I have ever read on BTC/Alt. It explained very well the actual truth and that truth is there is now BILLIONS of USD in newly created value that is unlikely to invest in NASDAQ/NYSE businesses and is FAR more likely to invest in new ideas in and around the space. As this speculative "bubble" grows this story in somewhat MSM is actually really accurate. When you think about Satoshi white paper and what it has done to change the world it is becoming more and more clear this technology is at least as disruptive as the Internet and it could be even bigger... What a time to be alive! *Note at the height of the dot com bubble when the bubble "burst" there was a drop of over $1.7 Trillion (WITH A T) USD. This tells me the author is accurate, this is just getting started. Yes there are some pets.com stories out there but there is also an "Amazon" and "Google" being born right now...

Why does KNC have a bad reputation? Hmmm... let me think about it.
1. Presell hardware
2. Collect MILLIONS
3. Do NOT deliver on time EVER
4. delay refunds or refuse them. 
5. Make a killing in the price run up (allegedly "pre-minimg" errrr testing) 
6. Raise major funding round. Take all money build your own machines to compete and crush all the suckers...errrr. "customers" who helped you launch.
rot in hell KNC...

Actually if you have ever had a conversation with a newb who is not able to grasp the idea of a blockchain, deflationary currency, reading white papers, etc. this simple analogy is what sticks in their mind and helps them. I have literally spent 30 minutes with good friends digging DEEP into the technology. One year later they are like "man I wish I listened to you" I am almost 20/20 with this explanation and nearly every person who I explained this too came back within a month with a wallet, and BTC in it. So I guess the moral of the story is try it and see for yourself. I guarantee this explanation will work for your parents, uncles and family WAY better than what you are doing now
