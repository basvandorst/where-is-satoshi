Erm, someone tried to hard fork Elacoin?! I was the original developer (Milkshake, aka TradeFortress) and gave up on it in a week due to the launch issues. I still think the concept is worth exploring though.

Try hacking this. We've had more than a dozen pentesters try and break into Inputs.io

Hi, this is intended - it's to prevent keyloggers. Sorry but your account is too new.

Yes, you can! 
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:10:53
Right, but if you send to someone who doesn't have an account yet we'll send them an email making it possible for them to claim the funds.

Hi, TradeFortress here. I'd like to clear something up:
1) I did not gain anything from the "scam".
2) Some completely unaffiliated people have been able to get BTCs from a flaw in Ripple (valuing all IOUs the same, despite how this never happens in the real world). 
3) The experiment had nearly a hundred participants, of which about 3 lost money to other people who used the flaws.
4) How the experiment worked was detailed on RippleScam.org. I suggested that people read it in the thread.
5) CoinLenders is not a social experiment, nor a ponzi.
**Yes**, I've learned a lesson to not do experiments/PoCs in the future that causes people to lose money. However very few people complain when someone releases a proof of concept for a vulnerability after following responsible disclosure practices to the vendor, and the PoC leads to people getting hacked.

The captcha should show up when you're copy pasting (I just tested it) - you may need to wait a bit.
@_date: 2013-08-04 06:07:19
This issue has been resolved hours ago. The OP has been sent 2 BTC to their Inputs.io account.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:53:28
Entering something in 2 factor when you don't have it enabled does nothing.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:49:30
Please do a "view source" and see if Recaptcha is HTTPS or HTTP. It should be displayed as https.

Your PIN is NOT 2fa.
Thanks for the heads up.
EDIT: Thanks for pointing out the typo, but we're not sure where you found it. There is no "lachine" in our repository anywhere.
The scribble can be anything you want to jot down like "remind to pay back my friend $%", "check out this new bitcoin service". Don't put anything sensitive there :)

We'll have a big announcement soon that will clear this up. Note that all the existing services we offer right now will still be here, with no fees!

You're not - and congrats on getting a 3 character username (we just disabled generating new usernames less than 3 chars)

Sorry but you were registered today.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:02:10
We use bcrypt on the server side.
We do know your private keys, however keep in mind that if I'm in the business of stealing them I'd have put an innocuous line in the Chrome Extension.
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:16:17
Thanks for the feedback! You have a Bitcoin address too.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:53:48
Hi fear_hardcore,
We recently added extra responses (forex rates). Existing responses have not changed so it is still compatible. We'll work on documenting!
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:15:24
That username isn't ok - changed :P

This is definitely a valid concern, but I'd suggest reading this:

You can just send it to your wallet address.
But we'd love it if you stayed :)
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:30:54
Didn't think of that - thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:04:00
We'll be making an announcement soon that should clarify that, however for business reasons we cannot disclose it now. Everything we offer now will not be changed.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:51:37
Not yet, but our site design is responsive!
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:50:08
There is a 0.0005 BTC tx fee if you are sending out of Inputs.io. (That's mostly to cover TX costs anyway) No fee if you're sending on the chain. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:32:47
Thank you! sent.
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:32:37
We've secured tens of thousands of Bitcoins for CoinLenders which is subject to daily attacks. None has succeeded.
All private keys are stored on a separate secured server (we own the metal).
Keep in mind that if Blockchain.info is hacked, if you sign in kiss your private key good bye. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:24:57
Sent! Sorry if I missed you.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:40:26
Thanks! Stop taking up all the good usernames, dammit :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:13:25
This is true, but keep in mind that Bitcoin is not very accessible right now. Some people prefer the peace of mind that a trusted third party is keeping their Bitcoins safe and backed up securely - better than losing your coins because you visited a Java drive by or your HDD failed.
In addition, Bitcoin will never succeed if you need to wait 60 minutes to for a transaction, or download 8+ GB of the blockchain. We're here to fill the gap - for the users that trust us because of our history and want a good Bitcoin experience, even through it is not trust-free.
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:12:24
It says 0 days on RES. Sent you the 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2013-07-27 07:59:28
Hi, TradeFortress here!
I put a lot of attention in managing the risks. It had gotten a lot harder as CoinLenders grew to keep getting the same returns, but we're still doing well without pushing into higher risk territory, and the rates we offer can be simply adjusted.
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:19:01
That's right. We actually can't remove client sided hashing without requiring the user to jump through hoops, now that I think about it.
SHA256(SHA256()) ftw!
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:00:08
That's the purpose of your recovery key.
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:48:53
We are looking into support for Litecoin however for technical reasons you will have separate wallets. Your logins will work the same.
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:37:05
Thanks - we've fixed the bug!
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:33:03
You can suggest that to your favorite sites

We'll be looking into adding LTC. Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:43:54
If they already have an account, they'd need to log in too. This is how PayPal operates too.
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:01:33
Hi, TradeFortress here!
The hashes are computed client side because it was a legacy feature of when we didn't have a SSL certificate. We do now, so it is unnecessary, but it doesn't hurt to remove it.
On the server, we hash user passwords with a user unique salt.
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:52:46
We've given away more than 2 BTC in total. Thank you to everyone for your feedback and support! We're excited to bring more competition to the Bitcoin economy, and we're not here to make a quick buck - everyone at the Inputs.io team sees Bitcoin as a revolutionary protocol than a fad.
We're working on an automated tool to detect fraud and abuse of our giveaway - we want to spread Bitcoin around, not have one user claim a dozen times. We'll be back sending coins soon - keep them coming!
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:08:37
No, it is not, sorry! How are you finding this?
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:00:32
That's odd - the link works for me! It's supposed to redirect to pay?to=1base58 but that's not blank here.
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:53:06
This username doesn't exist - have you claimed your username?
EDIT: Saw you registered. Just sent.
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:43:36
Protip: You can't login with a username :)
We have cold storage that is adjusted automatically depending on the frequency of coin movements, and we are also working on a "dead mans switch" where trusted parties would gain access to the private keys

I'm the lead developer behind Inputs.io (also known as TradeFortress). I'm actually the person that worked on Blockchain.info's Chrome Extension :)
Client side encryption isn't really secure, because it's trivial for Blockchain.info to send you malicious javascript - that makes you sign a transaction giving all your coins to them. 
As they run the biggest block explorer, they can hide those transactions from the website and searching will return nothing. They can do this in batches of users - for example, those who are on mobile phones first - and effectively raid a very large majority of people's coins.
And this doesn't have to be malicious by piuk - if the server gets compromised, you know what the attacker is doing. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:30:46
Your coins are automatically mixed. They come from someone else's address, and we auto mix transactions in addresses too.
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:41:16
This is HUGE.
@_date: 2013-07-27 08:05:05
Hi, TradeFortress here!
BTC is a highly volatile currency - much more than 30-40 pips for fiat pairs for example. Some central bank base rates are 20-30% in countries with high inflation or a very unstable currency. A high APR should merit more suspicion, but not always "too good to be true".
We **don't** have long term positions on BTCUSD. However, we do perform some trading (only a portion of the deposits that can be covered if it flops), such as selling coins while it was hovering around $130 and rebuying them around $70.
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:52:18
Thank you! Also, sent :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:26:54
We updated the help text to be more clear. If you are on a slow internet connection, you'll need to wait a bit after entering "confirm password" for the CAPTCHA to load.
