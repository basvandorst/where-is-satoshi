So much talk of retiring with some people at &lt;1 BTC. I'd need BTC to be circa 100k to 250k to think about quitting my job

He could always buy more and transfer at a later date though

Bullish I am

Having just recently taken my BTC to Electrum, when the fork happens how do I sell off these 'lesser' coins and add to my BTC [provided BTC wins...]
Will I receive equivalent fork coins on Electrum itself, sending them to Coinbase, exchanging back for BTC and then sending back to Electrum? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:06:47
Electrum is the one to use.  Very safe and easy to use 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:22:49
Is it easy to transfer from Coin Base to Trevor,  any guides online?  Also how would it work if I wanted to buy BTC again in the future and linking that back to Trezor
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:11:41
Heard it's pretty good
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:57:34
I do intend to do that once I reach my desired level of BTC.  Trezor is what I'll be using 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:37:29
I'm talking Trezor with delivery on top.  This is in GBP at least
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:30:53
Now that I've moved the investment...how do I keep track of the value in GBP on my phone?  Used to quite enjoy seeing the price on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:05:43
What does a node provide?   I mean all I personally want to do is buy BTC on Coinbase and then stick it into Electrum and then a Trezor and then forget about it...
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:23:33
Trezor is better
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:24:20
Trezor is better

Can you move BTC now to a Trezor and then buy from say Coinbase again at a later date and put it back on to the Trezor adding on to your overall BTC amount or does it stay separate 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:37:50
Guys if I transfer my BTC from Coinbase to Electrum (any ideas on fees?) am I safe from the disadvantages of the fork?  I know I'm not truly safe in my investment until I Trezor but wanted to make sure I do the right things now...what are the benefits (with the fork in mind) of having my money in Electrum as opposed to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:26:03
More like a 100 dollars, still an insignificant amount in the grand scheme 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:58:51
No idea.  Electrum seems good and that's where I'll take my current BTC.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:15:36
British Airways had it too
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:06:03
Electrum is what I'm using personally.  Not mobile though
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:59
Trezor is better
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:17:43
It'll most likely be after the fork now.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:24:16
Also why Electrum, looks similar to Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:30
Trezor is better
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:19:01
Good.  Hope it drops as low as possible so I can buy at a low price.  I want to get as close as I can to my end investment and hodl til the price reaches 250k
