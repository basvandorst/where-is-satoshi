Well, if you were in Brazil I'd advise you to seek an attorney. Here a bank can't decline you as a costumer due to the way you spend your money. It would give you a few bucks in damages. 
Are you certain that they can do that? Banking is usually a public service very regulated by the central bank Keeping you from opening/maintaining  an account would be equivalent to deny you telecommunication services, energy, transportation or any infrastructure related service. If you have any lawyer as a friend you should ask him if they can do that.
Good luck searching for a new bank.

Well, here a business can't refuse to sell you a good/service if they have it in stock and you're willing to pay the value they are charging.
With banks it's even "worse". They are obliged to take you as a costumer for free and offer you a minimum package of services free of charges (4 cash withdraws, 10 check sheets and 2 bank transfers within the same bank).

What are you waiting for? You already posted this plan a couple days ago and I said I'd be an avid reader and follower of your blog, if you decide to share your progress with us.

Yes. It's feasible and mining companies are also concentrated.
