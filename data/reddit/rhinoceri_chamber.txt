I don't know if Donald wrote it down but it's definitely a rule he enforces, yes. Just ask anyone who dared to show him disloyalty how it worked out for them. lol

It's really entertaining watching people in this thread who are pro trump and pro Bitcoin try to struggle through their cognitive dissonance. lol

Dude, whatever you find come back here and say you were not able to recover anything. Don't paint a target on yourself.

Dear Diary,
I guess today is going to be just like yesterday and every other disappointing day of the last few months. I logged in to Reddit to check keynet10's profile when I woke up, same as always, and same as always there was nothing about when or if they are planning to sell off their bitcoin. Not even sure why I bother anymore (waking up I mean).
The worst part about all of this is keynet10 probably doesn't even know I exist, probably has no idea how important the future of their bitcoin is to me. I'm too chicken to say anything, so instead I suffer in silence. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to just blurt it out, to grab keynet10 by the shoulders and shake them while shouting "Just tell me! Stop tormenting me this way!!" but the fantasy doesn't make me feel any better. This is all so unfair!
EDIT: Oh, Diary! It happened - it really happened! This afternoon keynet10 announced all their bitcoin was sold. I almost can't believe it! Finally, after I had given up hope, my dreams have become reality.
