rofl, someone deciding to fire up some tether fud after they stopped paying shills to do it.
This is a non-issue, finex makes a shit ton of money, they can cover the amount of tethers.
bitstamp doesnt use tether, neither does gdax, the 2 largest spot exchanges.
at a certain point you get labeled the boy who cried wolf, i thought the imminent crash of tether was 3 months ago? its still here.
