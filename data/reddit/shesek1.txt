That ETC they were sending out belonged to their customers. When these customers ask to withdraw their ETC, Coinbase would be short by whatever they lost via the reply attacks.

But the exchange *was* dealing with ETC, which is the chain with the original consensus rules. Most critically, the consensus rules in ETC were the consensus rules used during the initial deposit of ethers into the account balance.
The Coinbase customers who deposited funds under the old consensus rules can rightfully demand to withdraw them under these same rules; only allowing withdraws in ETHF would basically mean that Coinbase took their customers' entire crypto-coin balance and rewarded them with a new, different crypto-coin instead.

This is nonsense.
- There is no actual conflict and no potential disruption of any kind, this is pure FUD. Both projects using the same enum value will work just fine.
    &gt; Yes, they use the same enum. So what? Support for BIP152 is negotiated. As far as I know the only consequence of the index reuse is that an implementation couldn't support both protocols simultaneously on a single connection. That is it. It would make no logical sense to run both since they both accomplish the same thing (though BIP152 does so more simply and efficiently).
    &gt;
    &gt; @ [the github issue](
    &gt;
    &gt; ---
    &gt;
    &gt; BIP 152 and "xthin" negotiate their usage before use. The fact that they use the same index for their message is harmless, actually better than harmless: why burn a new message type for what is essentially the same message-- a partial block-- when you're already negotiating what encoding to use for those partial blocks separately.


    &gt;
    &gt; @ [a lunatic-as-usual r/btc thread] (- The sole reason this happened is because the people at Unlimited have [explicitly refused to collaborate with other implementations and did not write a BIP]( to document XThin. Have a BIP been written that documented the enum values being used by XThin, this whole debacle wouldn't have happened.
- There's no chance that any serious amount of money was moved because of the lunatics at rbtc. Who takes them seriously anyway?

I think that what they're saying is that they were still running on an old bitcoind version that sees segwit txs as non-standard, and therefore won't accept them until it sees them in a block. In other words, it ignored unconfirmed segwit transactions and only displayed them to the merchant when confirmed.
This is the simplest kind of upgrade, as they only needed to update their full node software and nothing else in their stack. And it still took them forever. :(

Yes, funding/peers/channels management didn't make it to v0.1, but I am planning to add it eventually.
For now, Spark focuses on the core aspects of day-to-day usage (sending &amp; receiving payments), where the initial setup (funding, connecting to peers, opening channels) is expected to take place via the RPC ahead of time.
(the wallet UI does expose an RPC console where you could do that though, if you [enable expert mode](
@_date: 2015-12-06 08:26:22
Yes, the same thing could be (and is being) said about the Lighting Network. But the stakes there are much lower - the most a misbehaving LN hub can do is temporarily freeze your funds, but you'll get them back eventually. With what you're suggesting the stakes are much higher: the worse that can happen is that you receive imaginary bitcoins in return to your real goods, services or currency. Basically, you can be rubbed.
You don't need to control *every single blockexplorer in existence*, just the ones that your victim relies on. Probably one or two? The most commonly used ones (currently) being US-based...
Basically, the model you're suggesting is Bitcoin without proof-of-work: just have a bunch of trusted authorities that dictate the historical sequence of events, and hope that you have enough of them and in different jurisdictions so that the system is trustworthy.
If that works for you, great. But Bitcoin attempts to provide a much stronger guarantee, and compared to that, your suggestion is a step backward.

This is only true if the user is actually verifying the hash-chain links from the genesis to the present. If his software assumes the pre-fed information is correct (because it was supposed to already verify it at some point), it could contain information that is different from the real history, even if the tip of the chain appears to be the same.

Just holding the UTXO set and receiving/validating/relaying blocks and transactions is quite bandwidth/resource-intensive, even if you don't hold all the historical blocks. I would even say that the hard-disk space requirement for holding the historical blocks is probably the least problematic compared to the bandwidth, RAM and CPU requirements (which are the same for pruning nodes).
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:30:58


Additional space is one of the very least good reasons to use sidechains. There are plenty of other, much more appealing, things that one can do with sidechains. Even if blocks were limited to 20GB, there would still be tons of interest and VC funding flowing into sidechains.
Edit: And more that - the SPV proofs needed for the two-way pegging require non-negligible space, so the sidechain devs should even be pushing to a higher block size limit, if anything.
 


There's only one such dev, as far as I'm aware.
This whole "hidden agenda" thing seems ridiculous to me. The overwhelming majority of the core developers oppose raising the block size limit to 20MB as per Gavin proposal (but mostly do support raising the block size limit in general). The only ones supporting it are Gavin and Mike. Wouldn't it make more sense to look for an hidden agenda in the overwhelming minority group, rather than in the overwhelming majority? (not that I think there are such hidden agendas to be found - just saying that it seems like it should make more sense to look for that on the other side of the debate...)

The fact that you can have many different centralized service providers to choose from definitely helps limit the power any single service has over the users, but this is still a centralized institution architecture that provides a much weaker guarantee to users compared to a true peer-to-peer architecture as envisioned in Satoshi's white paper.
Also, take into consideration that block explorers are prone to attacks and still rely on standard internet and certificate authority infrastructure, making them vulnerable to hackers (who can access their servers and make them say whatever they want) and MITM attacks (especially in the case of state-sponsored attackers, who can NSL their way into making SSL-protected services secretly lie to their users). Being a full participant of the Bitcoin network and relying on proof-of-work consensus and cryptography protects you against these kinds of attacks.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:57:14
This is not true. If they changed the consensus rules in a way that required an hard fork (e.g. generated coins out of thin air, include a transaction without a valid signature, etc) their blocks would be rejected by the rest of the network, effectively making them mine on their own private coin that everyone else ignores, and making the previous 49% the new 100%.
@_date: 2015-06-09 09:34:22
CoinJoin and CT works very well together - CT fixes the major shortcoming in CoinJoin, which is leaking data via the amounts being sent. Combined together, you can obscure the transaction graph with a pretty high anonymity guarantees.

You can't really compare the two. The architecture for a chat app would allow for sharding, distributing computation between nodes and load-balancing incoming connections. It's completely different for something like Bitcoin, where you can't distribute the load, every node has to do everything, and the purpose of having multiple nodes is completely different. Comparing the numbers like that is quite meaningless...

@_date: 2015-06-09 04:09:25
What you're asking for isn't really possible. With pruning we could only save disk space by not holding all the historical blocks, but every full node would still need to hold the entire UTXO set and mempool (requiring RAM), receive all new transactions/blocks (requiring bandwidth) and validate all the new transactions/blocks (requiring CPU).

I think you misunderstood how SPV works. SPV clients definitely do verify proof-of-work and follow the longest chain, they just don't verify the entirely of the blocks contents. This gives you a weaker guarantee than being a full participant of the network, but a much stronger one compared to blindly trusting block explorers.


Right. That's Bitcoin without proof of work: ask a few trusted authority figures and hope for the best. Somewhat similar to the Bit Gold proposal by Nick Szabo.


That's not how people work :-/ Different people have different expectations and different risk tolerance... what works for one does not necessarily work for others. Evidently, trusting authority figures and hoping that there's enough of them to avoid corruption/hacking works for you, but not for me.
Edit: &gt; but you can be lead to believe you don't have money you actually do have.
Or the opposite, which is much worse: leading you to believe that you do have money which you don't. This basically gives the power to create coins out of thin air, defraud merchants and steal goods.

SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY existed long before Lighthouse, and Lighthouse only uses that for a very specific use-case as part of transactions made in Lighthouse itself, and not as a general-purpose use-anyonecanpay-for-collating-txs solution. I don't really see how this contributes to scalability...
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:14:34
The docker image comes pretty close to that I think (it automatically sets up bitcoind/lightningd/spark and configures them to run together).
If you already have a c-lightning node running, all you need to do is grab the [release]( for your OS and run it.
Edit: but I would say that Spark is more suitable for tech-savvy users at this stage and is not yet ready for the average joe. Will get there too, eventually :)

It's still important to get that point across. Many of the pro-20x-increase people seem to think that Bitcoin could reach VISA scale and that this is the way to get there. These people will probably be pushing for another increase once we inevitably get to the point where 20MB is not enough. (And why not? Many of the arguments being used today would still apply...)

I'm not sure I understand. Using the Bitcoin currency does not imply storing the data on the Bitcoin blockchain - the currency and the storage network are two different things.

If someone is ever copying a transaction from somewhere to sign locally, they should definitely confirm the transaction does what they think it does with `decoderawtransaction` prior to signing it.

I'm Nadav, the developer behind Bitrated. I helped implement multi-signature and the website, and worked closely with Ron Gross and Edan Yago. I can confirm that they're indeed behind this.
Also note that this thread was submitted by Edan, and Ron also commented here (ripper2345).
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:32:47
The transaction happens in two stages - first, the buyer deposits the payment into a multi-signature address. Later on, the payment is moved from the multisig to the seller (in case of a successful transaction) or to the buyer (in case of a refund).
Each one of those transactions are handled like any other transaction and is confirmed by the network, so there's no chance of missing funds.
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:04:30
Hmm, I just gave it a try, and he website instructed me (as the buyer) to make a payment to a standard pay-to-pubkey-hash address.  This doesn't seem to be actually using 2-of-3 multi-signature transactions.
Can you clarify what you meant exactly by "Our transaction *are* 2-of-3 multisignature" and "the owner of the site can't alter transactions without a dispute being initiated"? This doesn't make much sense to me - the buyer is sending the funds to a standard address of a single private key under your control, giving you full control over the funds.
(Disclaimer: I'm the developer behind Bitrated, an arbitration marketplace that uses 2-of-3 multi-signature transactions.)
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:10:26
A few things to note about the differences from credit card companies:
1. Many arbitrators only charge fees for disputed transactions, making the majority of transactions free of charge.
2. Because no escrow is involved (even though some people call it "multisig escrow", its not really an escrow - the arbitrator doesn't hold or control any funds), you don't need to obtain escrow licensing, pay bonds/securities, retain lawyers, etc, which makes this much more open to new, smaller and specialized players in a way that's not possible in the traditional financial system.
3. Due to (2), an open and competitive environment for arbitration services can definitely lead to reduced fees, better dispute resolution process and more accountability for the arbitrators.
4. Another interesting benefit is the use of arbitrators with domain expertise. Say you're buying an iPhone application from a software developer. The arbitrator you would use in such case is someone with software development background, so that in case of dispute he can actually go over the project specifications and source code and use his expertise to actually investigate and decide who's right. This is something that credit card company representative could never do.
5. Another issue is "friendly fraud", where consumers pay for a product, gets the produce, then issue a chargeback and keeps both of them. This is made extremely easy by the dispute resolution procedures of companies like Visa and PayPal, who basically always protects the consumer, even on the expense of the merchant (friendly fraud is estimated to cost merchants tens of billions of dollars a year). The competition and accountability that arbitrators would have could really help reduce this by providing a dispute resolution process that's more balanced and fair to both parties.

@_date: 2014-12-14 00:17:13
It's actually quite easy to accomplish. You start with a transaction that has no inputs and a $2000 (BTC-equivalent) output paying to the project's addresses. At this point, the transaction is invalid because it spends more than the input's sum.
Then, each contributor would add an [SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY]( input with their payment. Once enough inputs are added and the output amount is met, the transaction becomes valid and is broadcasted to the network.
It's currently somewhat problematic to implement, as we need wallets to support adding an unspent output to an existing transaction, and a way to mark unspent outputs which are not meant to be spent (so we won't use those outputs by mistake). Also, this only allows crowdfunding an *exact* amount that's pre-determined (as any leftover funds from the inputs would go to miner fees, rather than to the project).
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:26:33
I do, however, think that its quite misleading to inform users of that only when trying to withdraw (rather that putting that requirement up front, before allowing the user to deposit funds).

The risk is somewhat elevated with a web application though. With desktop software, you just need to gain access to a reliable copy of the software when you first download it or during updates. Web applications can be updated silently and automatically, so the risk of getting a malicious copy happens every time you use the website, which can also be selectively done to some users or in some cases only.
Chrome extensions are much safer in this regard, and they are also digitally signed.

Producing the hardware and shipping it to someone else is different from holding control of the hardware forever like it is the case with cex.
And it doesn't matter what incentives they have or don't. Bitcoin was built on the premise that cryptography alone can guarantee the network operates correctly, with no need for trust. What you're suggesting involves trust. It doesn't matter how well that trust aligns with their own interests, it still undermines the very idea of Bitcoin.

That's pretty cool, well done! You should publish it more, I never heard of it until now (and I created another service for multi-signature transactions (bitrated), so I was actively looking for other such services and never bumped into yours).

It can't be overstated how big of a problem fraudulent chargebacks is for the porn industry. A lot of people claim they didn't pay for it after their spouse finds out, and the chargebacks costs them tons of money (not just the chargeback amount itself - there are other costs associated with chargebacks [1]) and makes it very difficult to process those payments (if you're considered too risky, credit card companies will simply refuse to process payments for you).
Also, small-medium companies are forced to use external companies that are specialized in dealing with payments for high-risk businesses, which makes processing those payments much more expensive.
The situation is also very similar in the gambling industry (a lot of companies prefer to refund payments even when they know the customer did pay for it and just don't want to deal with the losses, to avoid the credit card companies from getting upset with them), who can also benefit a lot from Bitcoin payments.

Not true. With 51% of the hashing power, they can start mining on top of an old block (as long as its after the last checkpoint) and eventually get to a longer chain than the rest of the network is working on. 


With 51% of the hashing power, the attacker can always keep mining on top of their private chain and eventually win.




Actually, they can undo whatever transactions they want. They don't need to double-spend them, simply not include them in a block.
They can also prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed, and some or all blocks from being mined - effectively having complete control over the blockchain.


A lot of ghash's hashing power comes from cex.io, which is mining hardware that they physically control. Miners can't control what pool its mining on.


Again, not true. They can undo transactions at whatever depth they want, as long as its after the last checkpoint.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:19:12
Even if they have less hashrate, all it means is that the transaction would wait for awhile in their memory pool until they mine a block. Given the nature of such transactions, they should usually not be urgent and it should be okay to wait a few blocks until they get mined.

Have you read the rest of the comment? Bitrated is a platform that allows using multi-signature transactions (an alternative to escrow that provides the same fundamental advantage to users), TMP is also offering multi-signature arbitration for the transaction that takes place in their market, and a lot of other marketplaces are offering (non-multisig) escrow.
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:13:53
There's another aspect to it that should be taken into account. Because credit card companies are making it so easy to do chargebacks and punish merchants so heavily for receiving them (additional fees [1], stop processing payments for them, etc), the incentive for trying to fraud consumers is basically non-existent.
Why try to fraud someone if Visa is just going to take that money back from you, and charge you some extra on top of that?
I believe the state of affairs is going to be quite different in the Bitcoin world as it becomes more popular. I imagine that we would start seeing farms of 1000's of e-commerce websites that looks very pretty and offer products at attractive prices, which simply do nothing at all once you send them the money. This kind of operation is very doable and scalable with Bitcoin, but completely impossible in the traditional financial system. We'll also probably see less extreme cases of shitty merchants who're going to screw over consumers and tell them to see them in court if they want their money back (again, not possible today).
[1] It is estimated that merchants pay a total of ~$2.8 for every $1 being charged-back.

Does replication and redundancy only come into play after the node running by the user who hosts the file notice that some pieces are missing? What happens if that node is down for a few months and is not there to watch over the files and replicate them? If it is the user's responsibility, it doesn't seem very fault tolerant :-\
Edit: Also, are there more technical details available on "three levels of encryption"? I'd be very wary about this - there are quite a few things to consider with multiple encryption schemes... this can go very badly if not done correctly and actually decrease the level of security relatively to using a single strong encryption method. There are strong encryptions today that are considered very safe, I'm not so sure if the risk of multiple encryptions is worth the potential benefits.
In addition to the security considerations, there is also an obvious performance hit for that, which might be considerable if you're dealing with huge amounts of data and require fast reading speeds (e.g. for video streaming).

It should be noted that the only coins in danger are the ones you imported, because someone else still had the private key and can use it.

I dunno. There are a lot of things that can be said about this case in support of Ross, but I don't think that invoking the lack of liability for service providers is one of them.
Ross definitely knew and encouraged illegal activity under the Silk Road marketplace. Whether it should be illegal or not can be debated, but this is the fact. This is very different from a case of an innocent service provider whose users used to conduct illegal activity, without the service operator knowing.
This is like the difference between opening a file upload website that some users choose to use for uploading copyrighted material (in which case, the service operator should definitely be protected under the DMCA Safe Harbor, under some limitations like following the notice &amp; takedown procedure) and opening a website that's *targeted* at illegal uploads, encourages it and have the service operator highly involved with the illegal material. Assuming that its illegal to upload copyrighted material (again, this can be debated on its own), I cannot see how one can claim the second case should be allowed - both legally and morally.

That's not true anymore. Multi signature transactions with up to 3 public keys are considered standard for some time now.
There's no reason that transactions paying to multisig (more precisely, p2sh addresses) would take any longer, but the transaction that spends it is somewhat larger and requires more fees to get the same priority as a regular transaction.

It doesn't have anything to do with the exchange knowing it, its the same privacy issues that any address-reuse causes - its all public on the blockchain and it leaks a lot of information.

Can it really be called colored coins if it uses that Open Assets protocol? The whole idea of colored coins is to take *regular* coins and give them a color. It seems to me like its not what it does at all... I don't see how its any more colored-coin-y than Countryparty and Mastercoin - it works quite similarly to them, by storing metadata about non-Bitcoin transactions inside Bitcoin transactions, with the obvious downside of not being SPV-compatible. 
I wonder what were the reasons behind this? Is it just because its hard to relay/mine transactions with small outputs?

I'm not sure how useful multi-signature would be as a generic feature inside wallets. There are many different use cases for multi-signature, which I believe require different interfaces and services tailored to the specific needs. Some examples for that are [TrustedCoin]( (delayed/reversible payments with a third party) and [Bitrated]( (2-of-3 for arbitration services. disclosure: I'm the founder).
It would definitely be good to have some support for constructing multi-signature addresses, making payments to them and extracting relevant information from the wallet, but I still feel that a specific interface is needed on top of that to make that really usable to users.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:36:21


Because multisig doesn't require the arbitrator to do anything for successful transactions, a lot of arbitrators choose to only charge fees for disputed transactions, so the consumer really has nothing to lose by using their services - same price if everything goes well, and an option to get your payment back minus fees is something goes wrong (in which case, without an arbitrator, you're pretty much screwed).
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:57:09
It doesn't work like that. They need the plain-text address in order to send funds to it, saving it hashed will make them unable to use it.
Also, I don't think that's the problem he was referring to - he probably meant that its a privacy leak on the blockchain itself, by being able to follow all the payments you're getting from there the moment the address is found out.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:11:43
Ugh, the writer and Bitgo seems to be really confused about what p2sh is.
It has nothing to do with multi-signature at all, its just a way to encode scripts as a Bitcoin address (p2sh means "pay to script hash"). You can have p2sh addresses that have nothing to do with multi-signature (they can encode any type of transaction), and you can use multi-signature without p2sh.

Consumer protection mechanisms and chargebacks are definitely possible with Bitcoin, either with regular escrow, or even better - using multi-signature transactions (see [here]( and [here]( for more information). I recently released [a service]( that helps manage the technical aspects of that process and provide a marketplace for arbitrators to offer dispute resolution services, which should hopefully help make this more commonly used.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:42:24
Why so?
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:55:13
Actually, while theoretically correct (they meant to limit standard transactions to m&lt;=3), its only checked with multi-signature script outputs - when using p2sh that test is not applied and you're only limited by the size of the script you can push in the input of the spending transaction (which limits it to 10 public keys, IIRC). I understood from the developers that this isn't going to be fixed.

Good counterpoints. As to the second one - you can still be forced to start logging this information if it touches your server at some point (as was the case with Lavabit). Otherwise you would have to modify the client-side code to send it, which is at least something that users can detect.

All of this isn't really related to .onion addresses, though. (1) can be achieved on clearnet by simply not using CloudFlare, and (2)/(3) would be the same by simply connecting via Tor, even without a .onion address.

You would still have to wait for the transfer to the escrow address to confirm, so its not really an alternative to waiting for confirmations (can be done in conjunction, though, if its relevant for the type of payment).

Multisig.info signs transactions using client-side code in your browser, so private keys should never be uploaded to the server at any point (though a dishonest operator could modify the client-side scripts to do that [note that multisig.info is run by vbuterin, a known and reputable member of the community], or a third party attacker could MITM the request and send other scripts).


For using multi-signature for the purpose of dispute resolution by an arbitrator, there's [Bitrated]( that (hopefully) makes the process somewhat easier to manage (disclaimer: I created it). Multisig.info is more general purpose and allows creating other kinds of multi signature transactions that aren't possible with Bitrated.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:39:02
Today its mostly used by marketplaces, and private buyers/sellers on forums and such.
You do have a point - its rarely used with regular merchants. But its still very new, multi-signature transactions weren't accessible to most people until very recently. Now that the tools and services to provide this are starting to appear, this would start getting more usage. Give it some time.

As others noted, this has some privacy implications. You don't need to be paranoid or laundering money in order to want to preserve your privacy.
It is, however, an excellent use case for stealth addresses. Have the users input a master public key (the stealth address), and only send payments to addresses derived from that. This will both increase security and preserve privacy.

The public keys are required for multi-sig, this isn't possible with addresses. I think that post is wrong, AFAIK bitcoin-qt doesn't support using addresses (though it technically could take the address and figure out the public key for it, but only for addresses that were spent from so the public key is available on the blockchain. But I don't think bitcoin-qt does that).

One other example is Bob's co-worker wanting to know how much Bob makes. Even if the employer is paying using stealth address, Bob's co-worker can make small periodic payments to Bob (also using its stealth address) and wait for one of them to be merged with the salary input (which can be determined by the approximate amount and time of the transaction).
Merging together inputs still has some privacy issues, even in a world where everyone is using stealth addresses.

Bitcoin allows many types of transactions using its scripting language. Currently, the standard transactions are limited to a specific set of whitelist templates (pay-to-pubkey, pay-to-pubkey-hash, pay-to-script-hash and multisig) that are relayed and mined by the standard Bitcoin client (bitcoin-qt/bitcoind), but if the transaction is mined and gets into a block its still allowed.
I personally think this is a bad precedent. The Bitcoin developers have a good reason to whitelist a specific set of scripts and disallow the rest, due to some security concerns and possible unknown attack vectors on the scripting language. I don't think GHash can be trusted to be as responsible about the types of transactions they allow.
Edit: As to your question about escrow - assuming you meant "escrow" using multi-signature transactions (which [isn't really an escrow]( those types of transactions are standard for some time now and are accepted by most miners and pools.
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:18:15
Its not needed for every transaction. When the seller and buyer have a long and established relationship and trust each other, or when its a very reputable merchant, or when its a personal payment between two friends, its relatively safe to pay without any arbitration in place.
For the cases where it is needed, you would have a lot of arbitrators to choose from so the load will be divided among them. Generally speaking, if there's demand for a service there will usually be enough supply to cover it.
As to your last point - we (I'm one of Bitrated co-founders) are working on improving the user experience and usability, there's definitely more room for improvements on that front. Still, I believe its already much better than what was previously available for using multisig transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:23:09
Yep, exactly. That's the purpose of using the key pool and pre-generating future addresses.
@_date: 2014-01-03 11:18:38
It is somewhat similar to BIP32, it uses non-deterministic key derivation. The main advantage over that and the payment protocol is that it avoids address reuse, while the payee is still passive and not required to provide new addresses before each payment.
Edit: and I wouldn't say that its "better" than those. I think its more useful for some use-cases while other alternatives are more useful for other use-cases.

Actually, by making this common place, they're making it: a. harder to trace coins, as there'll be a lot of unrelated people who receive tainted coins and it'll be quite impossible to search everyone and b. because the authorities know its common, it gives everyone the plausible deniability of "I don't know where those coins are from, someone just sent them to me".

This is really awesome, an open source ATM would make obtaining Bitcoin much more accessible and could really help adoption. Well done!
It could be quite lucrative to run one of those, which I imagine could really help it become wide spread, but I'm afraid that KYC and other regulations would get in the way of that. Have you thought of implementing a mechanism that would allow this to uphold to regulations?

The payment protocol can't prevent a program running locally from doing whatever it wants. A malware could either MITM the request to the payment server (possible even with SSL when its running locally) and replace addresses, do it at the time of the payment and replace addresses as you're about to pay, or simply just steal your private keys. 
A browser extension is limited to operating in the browser though, so it wouldn't be able to do this (unless its a web wallet).

He does have some vectors of attack - he can modify the transaction on the online computer and provide another transaction to be signed instead by the offline computer.

The thing is that you can't rely on anything that a software does if you're running a compromised machine, and no protocol can fix that.

Looks pretty clearly stated to me...
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:13:00
Yep, its very cool indeed! Other than the obvious downsides of giving your funds to be held by a third party, providing escrow services is also strictly regulated in many parts of the worlds and requires bonds, licensing and lawyers.
With multi-signature, all of that doesn't apply, which really lowers the barrier of entry for providing arbitration services and really allows to open that market to competition from new players. Traditionally it was companies like Visa or PayPal who provided it, who, imho, does a pretty shitty job at that. I believe that allowing competition can really improve that and provide an incentive for merchants to accept Bitcoin, in order to decrease fraudulent chargebacks and buyer fraud (estimated to cost merchants tens of billions dollars a year).
Another interesting aspect is that allowing "normal people" to offer those services can allow domain experts to give arbitration services in the fields they specialize in - like using an arbitrator who is a software developer for a software development project. Try explaining to a rep at PayPal how the source code you got doesn't cover the specifications...
I find what multi-signature allows extremely cool, which is why I went with the model of an open marketplace for arbitration services at Bitrated and didn't just create yet another arbitration service provider. (I founded Bitrated)

Sure they do. The global banking system is build on a network of connections, trust and contracts (which is really just a way to establish trust). In my view, Ripple helps digitize, structure and standardize something that already exists in a more archaic form.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:33:08
There are a few more things to consider:
- I believe people are more likely to trust an established service like bc.i than my own service (you're much better known in the community than me, so it might not apply in your case).
- I prefer to to keep myself in a position where I can't be given an order to reveal such information by simply never holding such information to begin with.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:00:17
Its also extremely hard to verify something like that; Watching the network tab is not enough, as the website could use a defective RNG to create private keys that can be determined by someone else (or just not use an RNG at all and pick them from a list instead).
The best solution I could come up with for this trust issue, when its an open-source project, is to provide a [browser extension]( that verifies the client-side code served from the server matches the code on GitHub. That would mean that the service operator (or a third party) would have to commit the malicious changes publicly, where they can be audited and detected.
Even for someone who can't do the auditing himself, just knowing that other people are/can check the code works as advertised, and that the malicious code would have to be shown publicly on GitHub, makes it much easier to trust the service to behave correctly.
Edit: Also, as I wrote in another comment, note that the developer behind multisig.info (Vitalik) is very well known and reputable. But you are right - it does require trust.
Edit 2:


Not quite - even without the scheme I described above, doing it client-side is much better for a few reasons:
1. Hacking the server in the future won't comprise all the old private keys, only new ones
2. It would require changing client-side code, which can be detected by a careful user. If its server-side, it can be a completely passive attack.
3. Because of 1 and 2, there's much less incentive for an attacker to try and gain access to the server to begin with.

I'm afraid that I have to agree with your concerns. On the [video thread]( from yesterday I also asked a bunch of unanswered or partially answered questions:

-  (why create a separate currency)
-  (their planned future move to a sidechain, which is not really possible)
-  (the claim that "storj would have to be" cheaper than centralized services)
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:08:52
Going the decentralized route isn't free either, there are costs associated with getting a decentralized consensus over the state of the network and payments.
Trusting a third party might be cheaper and more efficient than a peer to peer decentralized network in some cases (thought it obviously has its own set of disadvantages).
For example, a payment system built on something similar to the blockchain technology, but where you simply have a trusted third party sign blocks (instead of a using a PoW) can be much faster, allow for many more transactions and be more efficient electricity-wise, storage-wise, bandwidth-wise and cpu-time-wise. Of course, you lose all the benefits of a trustless decentralized system, but I'm not sure that efficiency and lower prices is necessarily one of those benefits.
Edit: I should note - I do think that Storj should be cheaper than the current solutions provided by centralized companies. I just don't think that there's anything inherent in decentralized networks (especially ones that requires consensus) that makes them cheaper.

Services can be built on top of Bitcoin to offer escrow services, or even better, arbitration using multi-signature transactions. I built one such service, [Bitrated]( and there are probably much more to come (like the [one offered by TMP]( that's currently on the frontpage).
This isn't something that's part of Bitcoin itself, just like chargebacks aren't part of the dollar itself but rather provided by credit cards companies and banks.
Edit: Also, to answer the OP - being able to provide arbitration services without an escrow (and the strict government regulation and high costs associated with it) is another benefit of using Bitcoin.
It allows smaller players to provide dispute resolution services for transactions, who can (hopefully) provide better, more throughout and more fair process than that of companies like Visa or PayPal (who almost always protect the consumer on the expense of the merchant), which is a huge benefit for merchants (that currently can't really do anything against buyer fraud and fraudulent chargebacks). Also, people with domain-expertise on some subject, like Magic cards, can offer arbitration services specifically for transactions in that market.
Bitcoin's multi-signature transactions allows to do that without an escrow, which was simply impossible before with regular money (like a lot of other interesting uses for [Bitcoin contracts](

This is not true. Bitcoin Unlimited adding the "Accept Depth" setting gives more power to miners due to the fact that users will follow the longest chain even if its invalid according to their local rules.
The situation today is that no matter how many miners are cooperating to change the rules of the system (increasing the block size and system requirements) and how long their invalid chain is, no one will ever follow it.
BU definitely changes that and gives significant new powers to the miners.


Miners choose what to do according to what they believe to be a good idea to do or not.
I'm not trying to force miners into not adapting dangerous proposals such as BU, I'm merely adding my voice to the discussion to try and convince miners and users that BU is reckless and that they should never adopt it.
This is how the free market works - people have opinions, they discuss them, and make decisions.
Again - the fact that this is possible for miners to do does not mean that its a good idea. Miners can also choose to change their PoW function to a different one. We could even give them a drop-box inside the GUI to change from sha256 to scrypt to keccak. Does that mean we should? No. It's a terrible idea, just like its a terrible idea for miners to change their max block size setting.

In addition to letting the user choose the number of inputs/outputs, it would also be useful to show the fee amount for the median (not average) transaction size.

How is "immediately" reasonable even for the scenario he presented? Even if no one opposes the change there are still considerable logistical challenges with coordinating a network-wide upgrade that make this *very slow* to deploy safely.
Think about CSV, CLTV or BIP 66 - no one opposed it, the developers all agreed on it, and it still took quite a long time to get them activated (as softforks that only require the miners to upgrade - an hardfork requires everyone to upgrade and will take considerably more time).
Given that the potential damage of not everybody upgrading in time is so extreme (splitting bitcoin in two), we should be doing this with as much lead time and extra precautions as realistically possible.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:24:09
This shows a huge misunderstanding of how testnet works. No one controls testnet, no one decides what to test on testnet, there are multiple testnet networks, and the BU developers could even start their own separate testnet if they wanted to.
And no, not being run on testnet is not the reason you can't talk about it here - the reason (for the 88373892th time) is that BU is trying to *change the Bitcoin protocol without consensus*.

Any improvement in scaling we can make is only ever going to give us a limited amount of scaling, and that's it. Are you expecting any single scaling solution to give us infinite more space?
Increasing the block size isn't different at all in this regards - increasing the blocksize to any X number of megabytes is also going to be eventually saturated.
SegWit will double the transaction throughput. Then Schnorr/MAST will roughly double it again. And then CoinJoin, TumbleBit, LN, extension blocks and sidechains would scale us further. If we get to the point where an incompatible hard-fork is the only realistic option on the table, we can definitely consider that too. But we aren't there yet - there are tons of forward-compatible soft-fork upgrades to consider first.

This is really inaccurate. Discussing the merits of larger blocks or any other technical proposal is and always was allowed here.
What is not allowed is the promotion of client software that attempts to change the bitcoin protocol rules without reaching a community-wide consensus first.

I am talking about soft-forks as an upgrade mechanism used cooperatively by the miners, with BIP9 signaling, no secrecy and no malice.
An "evil soft fork" that's done in secret is basically a 51% attack on the network, and yes - you're right about these being hard/impossible to detect/block.
As long as miners have the authority to decide which transactions to include, they can always abuse their power to prevent certain transactions from confirming. There were some interesting ideas for two-stage commit/reveal schemes that could take away that power from miners, but I can't find a link at the moment.

... as simple as making an incompatible change to the protocol that will break all existing clients and split the network in two.
No, doing this safely and correctly is anything but simple. SegWit being able to resolve malleability as a soft-fork that is backward- and forward- compatible and without the risk of splitting the network in two is nothing short of a miracle. People were sure that fixing malleability required an incomptiable unsafe hardfork, segwit being able to do this without one is truly amazing.
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:20:42
So why bother limit the powers of the miners at all? Let's just hand over control over the entire protocol to them and hope they'll be benevolent dictators. Why have full nodes enforce any rules?
And my comparison was to show that if the miners use their power to hijack the protocol today (for a reckless, dangerous, risky hard-fork that might split bitcoin in two), then people will rightfully worry that they'll abuse their powers again in the future for even worse causes.

Blocks being full is meaningless, the only thing users should care about is how costly it is to get confirmed within X blocks.
Making blocks appear full sooner than when organic demand actually filled them up helped certain interested parties to push the false urgency narrative.
I do agree that blocks are (probably) filled up organically today, but this doesn't really matter. To preserve an healthy fee market, the natural state of affairs should be that blocks are always nearly full.

From Gavin. 


Gavin himself admitted to it being flawed and revised it to 8MB.


Jonathan Toomim, the lead developer of Bitcoin Classic, is the one who asked the miners and came up with the 2MB figure. This had nothing to do with any of the developers from Core.


Unless Jonathan is lying, none of the miners were fine with 8MB when he asked them, especially not the Chinese ones.

1. Most merchant payment processing solutions are offered as a SaaS, meaning that anything Bitcoin-related is handled remotely by the service provider and requires no upgrade by the merchant. It'll be completely seamless.
2. When it is handled locally by the merchant, he has to upgrade his software anyway to keep up with changes to the network/protocol (any change, for example, when we raise the block size limit). RBF doesn't really change anything here.

Under that definition, would an extension chain soft-fork that introduces an additional UTXO set be considered an hardfork?


Define "function"? They won't be able to send/receive payments, but they can still follow the chain and validate the rules they're familiar with.
I understand the distinction you're trying to make, but the line isn't so clear to me. Some softforks (e.g. P2SH, CSV, SegWit) are purely additive and don't cause any interference to non-upgraded users, some create mild interference (e.g. softforks limiting the use of previously-valid-and-standard [non-NOP] transactions, which might confiscate nLocktimed transactions), and some are basically an absolute DoS attack on the old network.
My understanding was that the defining characteristic to differentiate soft and hard forks is whether non-upgraded nodes can still follow the new chain. In my mind, following an empty chain satisfies that requirement, regardless of whether there's some new underlying hidden data structure.
Would you say that the miners enforcing empty blocks (without a new underlying chain) constitutes an hardfork too?


That's also true with any softfork, though (i.e. users can opt-out of segwit with a trivial change too). I'm talking about a split purely due to logistical challenges and non-upgraded nodes, not due to users explicitly choosing to opt-out of the upgrade.


You meant ca*n*'t, I assume?
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:12:41


I said Schnorr and MAST, not just MAST.


IMHO, we are actually quite likely to never need to hard-fork. Almost everything that an hardfork can do can also be done as an extension/side chain, and even the things that really require an hard-fork are probably better done as an soft-hard fork instead.
We should start by taking the easy wins; soft-forking changes that can give us extra capacity with little to no risk. Once we're done with that we can re-evaluate and see if we still need a capacity-increase hard-fork, and what else we should be put in that hard-fork (because we sure as hell shouldn't be going through all the logistics of an hardfork just for a capacity increase... there are way more interesting and pressing stuff to put in an hardfork if we're doing one).

Because Gavin [had an arithmetic error in his calculations]( that showed 20MB isn't safe even by his own model.

Segregated Witness brings us a *larger* block size that what Bitcoin Classic was cheering for just until not too long ago. How is that not a compromise?

Sidechains and extension chains can definitely work, its just a matter of building consensus, getting it done and getting it tested.
A good hardfork proposal doesn't yet exists either and also needs development time; why not invest this time into a forward-compatible upgrade instead?
I honestly don't get it. Hardforks have become some kind of goal, when in reality its the worse way we have available to upgrade bitcoin. Hardforks are literally defined as being an incompatible change to the protocol that requires everyone to upgrade. If we can find technical solutions that don't require us to do that, then why should we?

I'm fine parting from users who think that the right way to advance Bitcoin is to break out of the consensus-building process, disregard the opinion of ~all the technical experts, and attempt to push through a contentious hard-fork. For me, the right way forward is to acknowledge that progress should be made based on technical merit and ecosystem-wide consensus, get back into the development process that have gotten us so far, and stop with all the "I didn't get my way via the technical community? Let's push it directly to the users as an hardfork instead!" shenanigans.

@_date: 2016-03-04 02:14:44


A majority of *miners*, not users. There's no way to gauge support from users, and entrusting the authority for changing protocol rules to the miners would be a disaster.


I consider attempts to by-pass the discussion and consensus-building process of the Bitcoin community as hostile.
If the development process was shown to be broken, then we'd have different story. We'd probably see a significant part of the development community (as we've seen with other software forks - i.e. nodejs/iojs, xorg/xfree86, etc) complain very loudly about the process being broken (not about "my proposal got rejected", but about a more widespread inherent issue with the process itself) and split off into a separate, viable fork.
What we have now is a group of a few individuals (Mike &amp; Gavin, and later Jeff) that weren't satisfied with the rest of the development community not agreeing with them, and decided to try and overthrow the technical processes we have in place. They didn't manage to get any following from the development community, and weren't able to create a viable alternative (manpower and expertise wise).
Do you think that anyone should be able to create alternative protocol rules and start a PR campaign to hype their wallet software directly to end-users, while going around the technical process &amp; community? This would create chaos, and I'm very glad that theymos is trying to prevent that from happening, in the same way that I'm very glad that he won't let Litecoin be promoted here.

Uh, "follow the longest chain" isn't how Bitcoin works - it's "follow the longest *valid* chain". If 90% of miners were to start mining blocks with 2x the reward, the shorter chain supported by the remaining 10% is the one that should be followed. The longer chain would simply be considered invalid and discarded by every other participant of the network.
Now, the question becomes - *valid* according to what rules? Which brings us right back to the beginning... deciding which set of rules to run is still an important question, regardless of miner support and "longest chain".

Core is in no position to promise such a thing. I would not support a rushed hard fork that's used for political purposes.

@_date: 2016-03-04 00:44:24


Doing an hard-fork safely requires a grace period of 6-12 months, to give enough time for the ~7000 full nodes to upgrade. SegWit as a soft-fork can be deployed in production as soon as it reaches a miner supermajority, which is much easier and quicker to achieve.
If you want the quickest solution that could be safely deployed, then soft-fork SegWit is the best option.


Why is that nice, again?


It provides a solution for these that need it. If we start running out of capacity and see the fees rise, users who want to benefit from SegWit will either switch to a wallet that supports it, or pressure their wallet provide to implement support. The 75% fee discount on witness data helps align the incentives very nicely here.
In other words - when we need the extra capacity, users who want to take advantage of it (and pay lower fees) will take advantage of it. If SegWit is not used, its probably because the extra capacity is not needed (yet).

Alternative implementations that are compatible with the Bitcoin protocol (such as btcd, bitcore, tbf, etc) can (and always could) be freely discussed here. Same goes for technical proposals and discussion regarding potential changes to the protocol.

- The payment request the user receives should indicate that they don't accept RBF transactions, and the user's wallet would know to handle that. If he does send it with RBF regardless (meaning that he explicitly modified his wallet to do that and is not acting honestly), the merchant should just ignore the payment completely in the same way he would ignore a payment made to the wrong public key, or a payment time-locked to a year in the future. It would simply be an invalid payment and be discarded (IMO, the sender shouldn't even get a refund in such a case).
- Alternatively, if the merchant does want to accept RBF, he would know that the risk of coming in-person (and being filmed on tape) and committing a crime probably isn't worth it. If it does happen, it'll be a cost of doing business - the same as credit card chargebacks ("friendly fraud"), shoplifting, etc.

Even if the miner is not part of a pool, you can still see that he's connected the the Bitcoin network and sends out blocks. Figuring out that these are new blocks mined by him, rather than blocks that the he's merely relaying, would require some more sophistication.
But this isn't really relevant: no one mines without a pool these days.
Aren't the connections to the mining pools SSL-encrypted, though? (but even then, you could see that he's connected to a mining pool, even if you can't see the contents of the communication. this would be enough to determine that he's mining)

Locking coins shows a real long-term vested interest in the success of bitcoin. Someone locking lots of bitcoins for a long time (taking away his ability to sell them) would be highly dependent on the long-term success of bitcoin, showing that he's incentivized to make bitcoin successful and that he has a high confidence in its long-term viability.
Digital-signature based voting (like Bitcoinocracy) only shows that the voter is *currently* holding bitcoins, but not that he has a long-term vested interest. Someone who is currently a significant holder but is planning to diversify into altcoins/fiat or to short bitcoin could abuse Bitcoinocracy-like voting system for his gains, then dump his bitcoins. Locking up your coins shows that you have some skin in the long-term game.
Bitcoinocracy-like systems also suffer from the fact that the voting is cost-free, meaning that people who don't care either way about the issue at hand are incentivized to sell their votes to someone else (because why not?).
In addition to that, time-locked voting also makes it harder for custodians (exchanges, hosted wallets, and anyone else who holds others' bitcoins) to vote on behalf of their customers. With bitcoinocracy they could easily vote with coins that don't really belong to them, while with time-locked voting that would mean running on fractional reserve for the duration of the lock.

These "technical crutches and work-arounds" is what makes bitcoin continue functioning smoothly for everyone, including non-upgraded peers. How is that a bad thing exactly? Backward and forward compatibility don't come for free and do require more clever engineering, but that's a totally acceptable trade-off.
If we already invested all the hard engineering work and reached the point where the new rules are activated and everything works well for old and new clients, breaking backward compatibility "just because" sounds completely insane to me.

The scenario says everybody is *willing*, not necessarily *ready*. There's a huge difference between the two. For most hard-forks (which actually do anything interesting other than raising the block size) there's going to be considerable amount of work to do around upgrading the full nodes and the surrounding libraries/applications to match the new protocol rules.
The question isn't "how soon would you personally download the new software and upgrade your systems", its "how soon do you think it would be responsible to assume that *everyone else* upgraded their systems in order to activate it, at the risk of splitting the currency if its too soon?"


That, I believe, is what the question is actually asking. In other words: "In the case of an hardfork that everyone supports, how long will it take for everyone to upgrade their systems?"

Decentralization != Anonymity. While you could possibly add some anonymity/privacy features on top of a centralized system (although that would probably be quite difficult too, given that the centralized system operator is going to be regulated and legally obliged to prevent anonymity via KYC/AML procedures), building a decentralized system on top of a centralized one is simply impossible and makes no sense even at the theoretical level.

Because they're trying to sell-off the miners' decision as representing the entire market. The fact that "hash power majority" is really just a proxy for "Bitmain's decision" is an important aspect of the these discussions. If we didn't have a monopoly over ASIC production and a cartel for operating them, then using hashpower to determine the market sentiment might've been a reasonable option.
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:28:46


The current system gives us a market-driven block size *limit* by people choosing to run software that sets a block size limit rule to a common number that everyone agrees on.
This can be further improved by shortening the feedback loop and making it safer to coordinate a block size limit increase across the ecosystem, but BU doesn't do that - it just takes the easy choice of giving even more power to the miners.


The fact that they can doesn't mean that they should. The rules of the system is something that needs to be coordinated across the entire community and industry, not set individually by every participant to whatever he wants.
BU has two possible end results: 1) miners get all the power and everyone follows them (if AD is set to anything other than infinity) 2) the network becomes fractured into endless pieces by people running with incompatible rules (if AD is set to infinity)
Exposing such dangerous configuration to users to reckless engineering.

@_date: 2016-01-03 23:34:44


This is completely not true. Miners were never meant to govern the network rules. They were given one simple task: ordering transactions. The rules are enforced by the entire network and cannot be modified by the miners. The only case where miners control the network rules is when you downgrade to SPV security and accept the inferior security from doing so.
Extending the authority of miners beyond ordering transactions and allowing them to change the network rules might be a plausible choice going forward. It is a terrible one IMO, but others may disagree. The important thing is that it is a choice that needs to be made by the community after discussing, considering the various factors and reaching a consensus.
Proclaiming that "miners control the network rules" as Brian is doing, without any wide discussion and consensus, is disingenuous and dangerous.

Losing the ability to sell is exactly what makes this kind of voting interesting. You're forfeiting your future freedom in order to prove that you have a long-term vested interest and gain more influence today.
People who hold lots of bitcoins but are not so sure that Bitcoin is going to make it through, who are thinking of diversifying their bitcoin holdings into altcoins/fiat in the short-medium term, or who are planning to short bitcoin, are really not going to like time-locking their coins away. True HODLers that are in it for the long run, on the other hand, will have an easier time doing so.

The CLI tool could indeed be used by reddit users to show they're true HODLers:
    $ npm install -g hodl
    # lock bitcoins for 4320 blocks (30 days) while (p2ch) committing to the provided message
    $ hodl lock --duration 4320 --refund &lt;address&gt; 'I am on reddit'
    # provides a p2sh address to lock funds into, asks for the deposit tx, then returns
    # a refund transaction returning the time-locked coins to the refund &lt;address&gt; (valid in 4320 blocks),
    # and a HODL proof showing the sacrifice and that it commits to the message.
    # check the HODL proof is valid, show the amount/time it sacrificed and the message it committed to
    $ hodl verify &lt;proof&gt;
This, however, would have significant privacy issues (linking reddit accounts to on-chain txs) and could mark the reddit account as a significant holder and as a potential target for extortion.
These concerns could be partially addressed with the use of some more crypto. Ring signatures could be used to hide the link between the user and the on-chain tx while still proving he made a sacrifice, and ZKP could be used to hide the exact bitcoins amount committed and only expose the Bitcoin Days Locked (BDL) metric instead (`number of bitcoins` * `time locked`). This way, you couldn't tell the difference between someone locking 2 BTC for 300 days and someone locking 300 BTC for 2 days - only that the total BDL is 600, which makes it more difficult to know who has a huge stash and who is just a true long-term believer.

Every full node in the network would reject these blocks. They won't be recognized by exchanges, wallets and users.

Uh, "follow the longest chain" isn't how Bitcoin works - it's "follow the longest valid chain".

The longer chain would simply be considered invalid and discarded by every other participant of the network.
Now, the question becomes - valid according to what rules? Which brings us right back to the beginning... deciding which set of rules to run is still an important question, regardless of miner support and "longest chain".

Bitcoin provides much stronger guarantees than democracy and should not be ruled by the majority vote. Any change being pushed without broad consensus should indeed be considered hostile.
Keeping the social contract between bitcoin and its users should be our  priority. Contentious hard forks breaks that contract, and, in my opinion, must be avoided (or labeled as what they are - a new coin with a different social contract *and a different name*).
Also, even if it was a good idea to govern Bitcoin by the majority vote, it's not clear at all that any of the hard-fork proposals actually garnered such wide support.

It's not about the naming, you should simply avoid promoting software that aims to alter the protocol without consensus.

The only reason its not is the fact that they're pushing people to use it today on the live network while there's clearly no consensus for it.
Alternatively, if your proposal has no code at all and is just a theoretical suggestion for discussion, that's fine too.

This witness and non-witness distinction is only relevant for non-upgraded nodes. For nodes that did upgrade, "the block" is now the witness + non-witness data, which can be up to 4mb in size.

@_date: 2016-01-04 02:13:00
Nope. Only the longest *valid* chain would be called Bitcoin, "valid" being determined by the set of protocol rules being used by the full nodes who represent the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:34:43
It does have a maximum, of a few thousands years IIRC.


It's not very fair to come and say that *now*, when people already have nlocktimed transactions and breaking compatibility would mean confiscating their money.

The people at blockstream contributed greatly to the design, implementation and testing of Bitcoin Core, helping to achieve all of the awesome stuff that you can see at 
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:25:48


Nope. The ordering of transactions and preventing double spends depends on just 50% of miners. The rest of the protocol rules, like validating signatures and controlling inflation, are being managed by every participant of the network. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:20:34


Nope, not really. The SPV security model trusts the majority of the hashing power to properly enforce the protocol rules instead of you having to do so. In the SPV model, miners can definitely steal coins, over-inflate the coin supply, or do pretty much anything they want. The only thing that can stop them is full nodes that fully validate, and other miners who (should) refuse to mine on top of invalid blocks.
Honestly, the SPV security model is quite terrible... it's basically "blindly trust the miners to act honestly and validate nothing". SegWit would allow for some improvements though, by making compact fraud proofs possible.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:26:54
They're only orphaning their *invalid* (according to the new rules) blocks. By default, miners do not add transactions that they don't understand (non-standard) to blocks, so they should never make invalid-according-to-the-new-rules blocks unless they explicitly changed their software to include non-standard transactions, or if they're trying to attack the network.

What businesses? I'm not aware of businesses that support BU, and see no reason any would follow the miners in the case of a split.
Miners provide a service to the users in exchange for the block reward. That's it. If they stop doing what their users want, they'll be made irrelevant and powerless.

The most worked *invalid* chain is not what you want to follow, as no one else would be following it. You want to be on the longest *valid* chain according to the rules that other participants of the network are enforcing.
Nodes could also be set to change the block reward back to 50 BTC once it becomes less than 1 BTC. They won't diverge until the point in time where this makes a difference (in about 15 years), just like how setting a different block size won't get you diverged until it makes a difference in practice.
Does this mean this there is no known way to maintain consensus for the 21M coin limit because some nodes could set a different value for it?
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:35:01
No matter how you slice it, Core definitely has much more talent with deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and distributed networks.

Again, this is only relevant from the perspective of nodes that did not upgrade. For nodes that do upgrade, "the block" is now up to 4mb in size.
You're right in that its mostly semantics. The important thing is that after segwit activates (and wallets [adopt it]( we'll have double the capacity compared to what we have today.

Altering protocol rules *without consensus* would harm bitcoin. If we're able to reach consensus over protocol upgrades, especially purely-additive, opt-in, voluntary upgrades like P2SH, CSV, CLTV &amp; SegWit, upgrading the system should not be an issue.

Everyone would love a permanent scaling solution that will last us forever. Unfourtantely, we don't have that. What we do have is a SegWit that will give us an immediate doubling of the capacity (to give some breathing room while we continue working on other, more permanent, solutions), or BU that is simply utterly broken on the basic technical level. Take your pick.

It makes no sense to bundle a hardfork with segwit just for the sake of it. Hardforks are *very* slow to deploy safely, while softforks can be activated in mere weeks. Why should we delay the immediate doubling of capacity that segwit gives it for no apparent reason?

If you believed that making this sort of vote would have a real influence on the outcome (say, help prevent a chain-split form happening altogether), would you not consider it?
It's an interesting trade-off. You can try to have more influence today, but end up in a worse position if the bad outcome happens anyway. Or you can better prepare yourself for the possibility of a bad outcome, but increase the chances of the bad outcome happening in the process.
Of course, all of this depends on the voting really having any meaningful impact, which isn't really guaranteed in any way.

Any node that mines or accepts blocks larger than 1MB will get diverged away from the chain the rest of the network uses.
You're only not isolated as long as your higher max_block_size setting has no effect because you never actually receive blocks larger than 1MB. The moment you do, you will be isolated (until that block eventually gets reorged out of existence by the ones who are properly validating the rules of the system).

The only thing I've seen core devs says is that in the case of an attack against bitcoin, we'll have no choice but to hardfork as a defensive move (due to a 51% attack, due to SHA256 being broken, etc). Which is a pretty obvious and boring statement to make.
An hardfork like that will still be dangerous, but it'll be a no choice situation.

The internet is the other way around: it has a very decentralized architecture in theory, but network topology has made it highly centralized in practice. I would say that its an example of a semi-centralized system on top of a decentralized one.
Also, note that Tor breaks completely with an adversary that has full network visibility, as we know some three-letter agencies to have. This is only possible due to the centralization of the internet self, and an excellent example for my case - building a foolproof anonymization software on top of centralized internet is very very hard, if not impossible.


From my experience, it is the other way around. You have the most resource-heavy services at the very bottom, and layers on top of that which cache, queue, optimize and manage the usage of the lower-level resources. (e.g. Varnish cache on top of resource-intensive PHP website, Redis storage on top of your graph database, APIs that queue jobs to the crappy legacy mainframe, etc)

It doesn't work like that. Every node in the network, even non-mining ones, validate all the rules and would reject such blocks as invalid. Changing the rules is not possible - not even with 100% of the hashing power.

Because SegWit already is a 2MB block size increase, one that we can activate safely, quickly, and without a currency split risk.
An hardfork would take 1-3 years to develop and test under Core's standards and would have a currency split risk.
Why delay the immediate doubling of capacity we can have within *weeks* until the time such a hardfork is developed? And why even do an hardfork if we can get the doubling of capacity without it?
SegWit first to relieve some pressure, then we can start thinking about doing a well-designed, well-tested hardfork a few years into the future, as a long-term solution for capacity and not just a one-time bump, and hopefully with some privacy and fungibility improvements too and not just for adjusting the blocksize parameter.

I agree, no change could indeed have other reasons (other than highly optimized coin-selection algorithms, another possible reason is donations made by advanced users using manual coin-selection to explicitly avoid change), but I think its *far* more common for transactions to have no change because they're self-transfers (into an exchange, another wallet, lightning channel, etc) than for any other reason.
Going over my transaction history in two of my wallets (cold &amp; hot), I can't seem to find a single transaction that had no change because the coin-selection algorithm managed to find an exact match for a real payment, and plenty of transactions where I was sending coins between my own wallets.
Is your experience different? Perhaps I'm not aware of other wallets that are smarter at doing this? Though it seems that even with a very smart and highly optimized coin selection algorithm, finding exact inputs still require some non-negligible amount of luck and would still be relatively rare.


Do you do that only in case the payment amount is round too? If so, this wouldn't trigger the detection. What I'm checking is whether there's a difference of more than 3 precision digits between the two outputs. In other words, that one output is round*er* than the other, not just that its round. If you're matching the precision of both outputs to be similar, you're doing this right!

These two achieve the same goal *for the duration the evil miner is in control*. The moment he's no longer able to finance his attack, or when more hash power is brought up to counter his, or when the proof-of-work function is changed to kick him off the network, *everything resumes back to normal*.
An evil miner bloating the public chain in a way that tangles it with valid transactions would be impossible to ever undo. We could be stuck with terabytes or petabytes of spam data that we'll have to carry forever and ever, making running a full node prohibitively expensive for many people.
It's basically the risk of temporary DoS vs. the risk of fucking up the chain forever.


They can reverse their own transactions by mining a double-spend of it, which would render the original transaction forever invalid.
For the case of other people's transactions, they can remove them from the blockchain and make them unconfirmed again, but not entirely reverse them (they'll float around in the mempool until the attacker is no longer in control, and then get confirmed). I believe this is covered by the *Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations* bit.

The hardfork would have to do much more than just raising the blocksize limit, only after all other (non-hardfork) options have been exhausted, and only if there's an extremely strong consensus among the development community as well as the wider community.
If it passes these criterias, my personal preference would be 5 years from when the upgrade becomes available until its mandated, but I could possibly feel okay with as little as 3 years if other sufficient measures were put in place to reduce the risks. ([related previous comment](
The exception to this would be an hard-fork that's required as an emergency  response to a catastrophic failure, where shorter time intervals might be acceptable.

The majority of the miners don't really care either way and aren't signaling for BU or SegWit. I do not think that you can honestly label these as "resisting".

This is not an actual risk. The new segwit rules will be enforced by all the full nodes of the network (currently already 60%), and reversing it would constitute an hard-fork.
I would personally strongly oppose any attempts to force segwit into an hardfork, unless it comes bundled with lots of other wishlist items (that cannot be implemented as a soft fork) and with a grace period of 3-5 years until the upgrade becomes mandated.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:12:56
I believe that there would be signficicaly more opposition to forcing segwit into an hardfork than there is today for segwit as a softfork. I do not see how such a "compromise" would get us anywhere...
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:37:41


How about a situation where the miners are preventing soft-fork protocol upgrades from being deployed?

- If you're pulling transaction history for your addresses from a third party service (as many mobile wallets do), the service you're pulling from would know all the addresses you sent him and could log them.
  The most private way to get your transaction history is to operate a full node. If that's not possible, a proper implementation of an SPV wallet should provide some enhanced privacy compared to pulling from a server, though its still not perfect.
  Edit: if you want to know if your wallet does that, the ["choose your wallet" page]( on bitcoin.org has a great overview of the privacy levels for different wallets. This specific concern is listed as "*Discloses information to a third party. This wallet uses central servers which are able to associate your payments together and log your IP address.*"
- If you receive 1 BTC to `address1` and 2 BTC to `address2`, and then want to send someone 3 BTC, you'll have to combine the outputs from both addresses to make the payment. When you do that, the link between `address1` and `address2` becomes known on the public blockchain. Some blockchain tracking companies use this information to cluster addresses as belonging to the same wallet.
  The way CoinJoin and similar technologies works break the assumption that all the inputs on a transaction belong to the same wallet and makes this kind of tracking much harder. Because of that, if CoinJoin-like technologies become widely used, even non-CoinJoin users would benefit from better privacy.
- When you send a transaction to the network, the nodes you're sending the transaction to can keep track of the IP address who sent them the transaction first and link the transaction inputs (addresses) with your IP. Some blockchain tracking companies are known to operate lots of bitcoin nodes for the purpose of collecting this information.
  Sending transactions over Tor would prevent this kind of tracking. Bitcoin Core has also done some work relating to transaction announcement to make this tracking more difficult.

Bitcoin Unlimited just surrenders full and utter control over the blocksize limit (and thus, over the resource requirements for operating a full node) to the miners. This is a terrible idea.


SegWit very elegantly avoids the chain-split risk of an hardfork, why would anyone sane take that risk for nothing? I would strongly oppose any such attempts.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:18:22
You don't have to go that far. See [the table]( in the OP - bitcoin is cheaper even for a $3.74 payment. And as my parent comment here mentioned, at $200 we're 16x to 27x cheaper compared to alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:44:28
Bitcoin does offer consumer protection, as an opt-in layer on top of the core irreversible payment system. I happen to be the founder of [Bitrated]( a platform that providers exactly that. You're right in that this adds additional costs, but I believe that an open, competitive market for dispute resolution can achieve results far superior to what we get today from companies like Visa and PayPal, both in terms of cost-efficiency and in terms of service quality.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:01:51


I'm not aware of any other cryptocurrencies that are actually being accepted as a medium of payment for goods and services (except for perhaps litecoin, on a tiny scale), so I don't see how you can compare them here.


Not sure what you mean by this. Time to confirm? The listed fee of $0.23 is for confirmation in the next block, or in roughly 10 minutes.


Bitcoin needs to adapt and improve over time. That's why he have a talented group of developers that worked very hard on building and testing segwit.
But at current time, even before further improvements are made to bitcoin, it still provides a better, more cost-efficient solution compared to alternatives.
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:18:21


The only difference between segwit-as-a-softfork and segwit-as-a-hardfork is where the witness merkle root is put at, which is very very negligible... I wouldn't call that "hackish" at all.
But even if it were, it would totally be worth it to avoid making a risky incompatible change to the network that could split the network and currency in two.
BTW, are you a software developer? Did you make up your own mind about this, or did you just "read it somewhere" and blindly accept this as a fact? [I am]( a software developer, and I can tell you for certain: these claims of segwit being inelegant are pure FUD.

You're absolutely right, we will see more efficient off-chain solutions becoming more and more popular for everyday use as bitcoin grows. The only question is whether these solutions are going to be centralized, or based on a decentralized lightning-style network. I am somewhat worried that centralized solutions would dominate the space if we keep delaying segwit and LN further.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:44:08
If all the bitcoin holders suddenly died, the blockchain would still continue to chug along... you only really need the miners to continue mining for the network to operate, but that would be a pretty useless network.
Also, miners are easily replaceable. The expertise accumulated by the development community is not.
Edit: also, you're disregarding the possibility of fatal bugs or security issues. With an active and knowledgeable development community, it would be a minor hiccup with some mild temporary discomfort. Without them, it would be a catastrophic event that would mark the end of bitcoin.

That's exactly why we have the blocksize limit as a protocol rule. People organize and negotiate ahead of time, set rules, and follow them.
Bitcoin Unlimited is a naive solution that does not provide a way to organize and negotiate and expects things to somehow work themselves out magically. They don't.

The parent to the comment I linked to tried to claim that Bitcoin is more expensive than credit cards by comparing it to the fees of card-present (physical swipe) transactions, and using the fees the banks pay to the credit card companies rather than the fees paid by the merchant. This is FUD.
And Bitcoin *is* 10x better, on many fronts that are far more interesting than fees. But even when talking just about fees, Bitcoin is currently 10x cheaper for payments of over ~$100 (a $200 payment would cost $0.23 with bitcoin, $3.65 with credit cards and $6.28 with PayPal. That's 16x and 27x cheaper, respectively).

This is why we have a threshold of 95% - near-unanimous miner support is a good proxy to approximate wider ecsoystem support. By the time it activates with 95%, nearly all the full nodes will be enforcing segwit. (we already have 60% of the visible full nodes running segwit-compatible software *today*)

Each individual miner has an incentive to accept any transaction that covers his own costs for including the transaction (some extra CPU time [for including the transaction into his merkle tree, not for the proof-of-work costs which are independent of individual txs] and slightly increased orphan rate, both being negligible and measured at a few fractions of a cent).
 
The problem is that if every miner takes that approach, all the fees go to cover the individual's miner costs and there's nothing left to pay for the security of the network (proof-of-work). The security would just dwindle down to a level supportable by transactions paying a fraction of a cent each, which cannot be sufficient.
Individual miners could try to impose a minimum transaction fee that ensures the health of the network, but the problem is that other miners are *very likely* to undercut them and just include all the transactions that are profitable to them, disregarding the network's health. This way, "honest" miners that want to improve the network would lose out on these transaction fees and be less profitable than their less ethical competitors. This is not sustainable - eventually, they'll all figure out that they should just grab whatever fees they can when they can rather than leaving them to their competitors.
The only way to have a healthy fee market is by ensuring that block space is a scarce resource that people have to compete over. If the block size is so large that there's never more demand than supply, there cannot be competition and the fees will inevitably go towards zero.
A dynamically adjusted block-size must algorithmically ensure to retain these properties. The miners cannot be trusted for this, as their incentives do not align with these of the users.
Edit: some slight modifications and explanations 
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:21:46




No! He still doesn't get it. No one can force you to accept a different protocol without your consent. By running a full node, you agree to participate in a cryptocurrency system under a specified set of rules, and them only. This is the same flawed mindset that makes him think that some percent of miners can coerce the network into upgrading to a different protocol (XT, Classic, Unlimited). They can't.

This gives disproportional voting weight to custodians of others' bitcoins, like exchanges and shared-funds wallet operators.


The *only* real difference between SegWit-as-a-softfork and SegWit-as-a-hardfork is where the root of the witnesses merkle tree is stored.

Indeed, SegWit does not fix the quadratic scaling of signature verification for non-SegWit transactions, but unlike a "regular" hard-fork blocksize increase it at least doesn't make the problem any worse. The worse-case scenario for quadratic scaling remains unchanged pre- and post- segwit.

It's not circular. Hard forks requires a coordinated network-wide upgrade, with the very significant risk of splitting the currency in two and putting nodes that didn't upgrade in time in danger. Even with a hard-fork proposal that has wide consensus in the community (which BU doesn't), a network-wide upgrade would still be a logistical nightmare with significant risks.
I would personally strongly oppose any hard-forks attempts, unless we exhaust all other options and an hard-forks is the only available option we have. It is not.

Bitcoin is a more efficient, lower-cost solution to payment processing. Whether its the merchants or the consumers who enjoy the costs savings is besides the question and not related to the payment technology itself, but to the consumer-merchant relationship and the competitiveness of the market. (my assumption is that eventually, these cost savings will be passed down to consumers, just as the costs associated with the inefficiencies of credit cards are currently passed down to them)

The trust in hardware manufacturers we have in bitcoin today does not create a systemic risk. Each user can choose his own hardware manufacturer to trust, in such a way that no single manufacturer or hardware type can compromise the whole network.
With Teechan, everyone has to fully trust a single company, Intel. Secured chips of different manufacturers could theoretically be used, but AFAIU they cannot interoperate with each-other (that is, each one would be its own network/currency).

It can break implementations that manually parse out data from the raw block bytes, which I don't imagine to be highly common outside of complex use-cases like block explorers and meta-layer protocols (such as Counterparty).
For the majority of cases, where the RPC is simply used to send payments and verify incoming payments, almost nothing changes.
For cases where transactions are manually constructed (that is, not created via the RPC commands), the majority of changes will be at the base library layer, not in the applications themselves. I'll be personally looking into getting segwit implemented in [CryptoCoinJS]( (of which I'm one of the maintainers), and will follow that by upgrading [Bitrated]( to use segwit (I founded and built Bitrated).
I'm anticipating the CryptoCoinJS upgrade to take around two weeks of my time (alongside other bitrated-related day-to-day work). After that, the work on Bitrated will mostly consist of upgrading to the segwit-enabled libraries, with some *very minimal* changes on the application layer itself. It's really not that complex.
The point being - once we start seeing segwit implemented in the base libraries for all the various programming languages, the upgrade to the applications themselves would be a breeze. Given the economic incentives (lower fees) and the relative ease of implementation, I'm very certain that we'll see segwit widely adopted very quickly once activated (and, in fact, we already have [23 companies and projects that implemented it]( even though they can't actually use it on mainnet!).

Right, in the case of a node that was already previously connected to the network and knows of some good nodes to start with, but not for new nodes that are just now joining the network (which could be very easily partitioned from the rest of the network by an attacker who has full control over the DNS seeds)... but I realize that there isn't really a great alternative for that, all P2P networks have and would likely always have some centralization for the initial peer discovery process (torrents have trackers, DHT has bootstrap nodes, Tor has directory authorities, etc).
Do you think this could ever be improved in Bitcoin, or is there really no way around trusted authorities for bootstrapping/discovery?
Edit: possibly with some mesh networking? but I can't think of anything that can be done on top of standard TCP/IP internet...

Planning them ahead of time does not somehow magically makes them non-controversial.
And even with a non-controversial change that has wide community support and strong consensus among the technical experts (which it definitely not what we have), coordinating an hard-fork network-wide upgrade is still a logistical nightmare with many challenges and risks involved.
Hard forks should be avoided if at all possible and be used as the last resort if all else fails. Not before that.

Well, the very fact that you sign this document already judges the fact. Point 1 is obviously considered to be a good thing if its on the list of points you're signing.


This is so superfluous - they're basically saying "the presence of more development teams creates a diversity of development teams". Well, duh!
And in any case, they are the same point - (3) just expands upon (2), trying to explain what is the "net gain" they're referring to is... but not doing a very good job at it. The argument is basically that more dev teams =&gt; more diversity =&gt; better bitcoin. You can make a good argument as to why more development team diversity is a good thing, but they make no such effort - that linkage between "more diversity" and "better bitcoin" isn't explained at all, its just scrambles  "diversity ... innovation ... solutions" together without really explaining anything. So I would say that (3) doesn't even really expand much upon (2), but just states an obvious fact (more dev teams =&gt; diversity).


I fail to see how such a case would make this relevant. Each implementation is developed by that implementation's development team, and a development team would work together on an implementation. There's no distinction here...

So basically: What we don't want to bitcoin become? We don't want bitcoin to become ... diversified with multiple implementations?
... which is the exact opposite of what they're saying.


So: How bitcoin should be developed? It should have no leader.

I know. What's why I said its a *proxy* that can be used to *approximate*.
I agree that miner support is not a very good approximation for the rest of the network, especially when the threshold is lower. But a near-unanimous miner support does say quite a lot about the readiness of the rest of the network, it would be extremely unlikely to have 95% miner support with &lt;80% full-node support.
Unless, of course, this is a deliberate attack by the miners where they adopt a change that wasn't vetted by the development community and the wider ecosystem. If this ever happens, we'll have to deal with this just like we'll deal with any other 51% attack.
But given that 60% of the listening node already support segwit and that there are over 100 companies that support segwit (including *all* major wallets), this is simply not the situation we have today.
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:28:35

Are we looking at the same document? How do you gather that from (1)?


They say no such thing, just "net gain". How do you figure that from the text written?


This just expands upon what they wrote in (2) - slightly better explaining what "net gain" they're referring to exactly,  but its really the continuation of the same thing. This is basically breaking down the "We believe that having many implementations is good because it leads to greater innovation" idea into two separate points, splitting them up just before the "because".


How is "no single team/person that has the final" different from "no official version [that has the final say]"? What does being an "official" version mean if you have no authority over anything? Just the fact that you slap the "official" tag on yourself? This is not how it works -- being official is only meaningful if the official version gets the authority to dictate things. Otherwise, its not official. I fail to see your distinction between (1) and (4).


Where does it say that? (4) only refers to what *we shouldn't do*, not to what we *should be*.

Someone who mines bitcoins for profit, sells them immediately, and doesn't care at all about that stuff. Which is the majority of the miners.


The network would've broke down many many times by now (from bugs, from inability to deal with the growing demand, from incompatibilities, from inefficiencies) if it weren't for the development community.

Bitcoin is far more accessible to the un-/under- banked (just a mobile app vs. the bureaucracy and inaccessibility of opening a bank account), and far far cheaper (for a $200 payment, its [16x to 27x cheaper](

Hard to tell for sure, but the development of [lnd]( (which I follow the most closely) appears to be going very well and is accelerating its pace. I'm hoping for around 3-6 months for the core software and infrastructure to be ready, and another 3-4 months until we start seeing it implemented in existing wallets and/or as standalone wallets. But even then, it should probably be used for no more than changetip-sized payments with relatively low-value channels at first until it gets more battle tested. If everything goes well and the ecosystem adopts the technology, I'm crossing my fingers for LN being commonplace and used for small-medium sized payments around this time next year, perhaps plus a couple months or so.

This is very misleading!
This price you quoted is for card-present transactions, where you swipe the card physically in the store and there's no risk of chargeback.
Edit (2): also, these prices are VISA's "interchange reimbursement fees", which is what they charge the *banks* [0] to process the payment, not what they charge the merchants (which is probably significantly higher than that).
For [card-not-present transactions]( which is what you should be comparing bitcoin to, the fees are `1.75% + $0.20` (according to your very own table).
Even if we go the relatively high fee the OP paid, Bitcoin is still dirt cheap compared to other payment methods, and gets cheaper and cheaper as the transactions amount grows. Here's a quick comparison to VISA and PayPal:
Amount | Bitcoin fee | VISA fee | PayPal fee
$3.74 | $0.23 (6%) | $0.26 (7%) | $0.42 (11.2%)
$10 | $0.23 (2.3%) | $0.37 (3.7%) | $0.61 (6.1%)
$100 | $0.23 (0.23%) | $1.95 (1.95%) | $3.30 (3.3%)
$1,000 | $0.23 (0.023%) | $17.7 (1.77%) | $30.18 (3%)
$10,000 | $0.23 (0.0023%) | $175.2 (1.75%) | $298.97 (2.9%)
An alternative way to look at that: for a $200 payment, Visa is 16x more expensive than Bitcoin ($3.65 vs $0.23), while PayPal is 27x more expensive ($6.28 vs $0.23).
Edit: added PayPal, based on numbers from the [paypal fee calculator](
Edit (2): note that the VISA fees in the table are still based on the (misleading) "interchange reimbursement fee" the parent comment linked to, and would be higher if they account for the actual cost to the merchant.

There's a major difference here: uTP was dependent on network effects - you had to have other users upgrade to uTP to enjoy the benefits of uTP yourself. With bitcoin, anyone that upgrades to SegWit-supported-software immediately enjoys the lower costs and added capacity, regardless of what anyone else on the network (including the ones sending payment to him) does.

Do you really not see that even your own words for (2) and (3) are the same? They both say that multiple implementations are a good thing for the bitcoin community, with (3) slightly expanding upon (2) by adding some extra words and modifying others... (3) uses "dev teams" instead of "implementations", (2) says "net gain" while (3) says "innovation and solutions"... totally negligible differences.


What does that even mean, as a statement that one signs? Of course that more of anything creates more diversity of that something... these are all just filler words used to repeat the same idea in different phrasings.
*"There is not one "official""* ... *"There is no leader"* - for any practical means, these are the exact same things!

From the perspective of an SPV user, blocks are nothing but headers and a hash root for transactions. An SPV user could say that the transactions "aren't on the blockchain", but are just committed to with an hash and stored to a separate database that some others (full nodes) know how to process. 
So yes, segwit isn't much different from the case of onename, which isn't much different from the case of normal transactions. The only thing that matters is what software nodes on the network are running, and once segwit is adopted the nodes on the network will run software that bundles the witness data alongside each and every block and transaction transmitted or stored. Meaning that for the users of the network, the witness data *is* part of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:45:05
Trying to figure out when a piece of software is going to be ready is more art than science. Software developers are notoriously known for having terrible time estimates. Anyone committing for a release date is either a fool or a liar.
Here this gets even more complicated - LN adoption is dependent on the Bitcoin network activating some features it needs, dependent on integration into third-party wallets,  dependent on liquidity providers locking down some bitcoins into channels, dependent on users adopting the technology,  dependent on merchants accepting payments via channels, etc...
But that's the beauty of the decentralized Bitcoin world. We don't have some company like Microsoft that announces some date and decides what's best for everyone. We have a complex set of interactions between all kinds of different stakeholders, so no one is in a position to do what you ask. The market will decide when and if LN is adopted.

Nah. A 30% minority will get blocks once every 30 minutes. Compared to the days it takes to make bank wires, this is totally acceptable.
Also, given that these minority miners will all be segwit-supporting, the effective capacity would double, giving us the equivalent of a block every 15 minutes.
This would be a mild temporary discomfort at worse, with slightly longer confirmation times and higher fees, until eventually the difficulty re-adjustment would bring us back to normal.

The merkle root hash of the witness data is embedded in the block and is getting hashed, such that tampering with any part of the witness would break the hash-chain integrity (just as it works with transactions).

Its quite simple: he's talking about blocks from the perspective of nodes that upgrade to use segwit, and you're talking about ones which aren't. Would  you be happier if people said "segwit is a blocksize increase for these that upgrade to use segwit" instead? I thought that it was quite obvious...
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:25:40
I'm afraid that you got this wrong :( Segwit is just a "dumb" capacity improvement, much like a blocksize limit increase (well, because *it is* a blocksize limit increase). However, segwit builds the foundation for several future true scalability improvments - the possibility for a new hybrid security model for network nodes, a better script versioning system that would allow adding things like aggregated schnorr signatures (iirc, making transactions 40% smaller!), removing the quadratic scaling of hashed data, fixing malleability to allow for better smart contracts (including payment channels and the lightning network), and more.

Do you not see the problem with that?


In the same way that we reached consensus for every previous change made to Bitcoin. We collaborate, discuss things, bring up arguments, explain our positions, and eventually - sometimes - we reach consensus and deploy the change.
I don't understand why this seems so difficult. Humans have been able to talk and resolve issues for much more complex matters. Many open-source projects are able to reach consensus with no "proof of work" or "longest chain", but rather just with words and discussing things. Why does that seem so wrong to you?

Unlimited does not have the signaling period and hashpower majority requirement that Classic/XT had; miners running with Unlimited are using different protocol rules *now* and could diverge  away from the hashpower majority consensus chain if a relatively small number (6) of blocks are mined in succession on top of an invalid (too large) block.
This require significantly less than a majority. For example, a 30% minority would produce 6 blocks in a row once every `1/(0.3^6) = 1,371` blocks, or once every 9 days, a 20% minority would produce it once every 3.5 months, etc.
Eventually the minority miners would figure out that they're on the wrong side of the fork and move back to the majority side, but by that time they have already lost the block rewards for all these too-big blocks. Hence, this thread to warn miners
@_date: 2016-11-20 04:49:28
They indeed should not, but the miners verifying this on their own is an important part of the checks-and-balances of the system.

I will give you this: (1) and (2) are different in that you could have multiple implementations, but still have an official one.
However, (2) and (3) are both showing the advantages of multiple development teams, in somewhat different terms. "diversity of implementations ... variety of development teams ... net gain for bitcoin" and "more development teams will lead to greater ... innovation ... solutions" are just the same thing in different words - "why having more teams is awesome".  "diversity of innovation" is basically the marketing-speak-buzzword-inflated version of "multiple implementations". The one difference I can spot is the inclusion of "more *developers*" (rather than "more dev *teams*") in (3), but even then - this difference is uber negligible, and in any case (3) encapsulates (2), making (2) redundant.
"Having no official bitcoin", even as you explain it, is also a governing matter. Saying that there is no official bitcoin *is* saying that bitcoin is leaderless. You can't have one without the two, the two requirements are satisfied by the exact same thing. Note the striking similarity: "no particular implementation ... holds claim to being official" vs "no team of developers has ... authority for the entire community". Basically, "implementation" replaced by "developer team", "official" replaced by "authority".

The witness data is on the blockchain. When upgraded nodes talk to each other, they transmit the witness data alongside blocks and transactions. When upgraded nodes store the blockchain to disk, they do so including the witness data.
You could perhaps say that its "outside the block" from the perspective of nodes that didn't upgrade, but that's surely better than the [upgrade-or-gtfo]( approach of kicking nodes that didn't upgrade off the network entirely.

How is your example related to anything? Upgraded nodes transmit, validate, process and store blocks that are larger than 1mb and contain both the nonwitness+witness data. When a peer on the network sends you a block, they send you more than 1mb. When you store blocks on disk, they weight more than 1mb. How is that not a blocksize increase?

Hahahaha yeah, I saw the previous version. It looks like they got people to agree on the first version, snipped it out to contain just the anti-core-focused propaganda points, then sent out a revised version for an urgency approval.
This is a pretty nice trick, actually - the people who agreed to the first version got the 2nd one and said "oh, well, this are all points that I already saw and agreed with... looks fine" and OKd it without too much thought. If the first version they received looked like the updated one, it might've been harder to get them on board.

Changing a single historical transaction on the blockchain requires re-doing all the proof of work that was done since that transaction. As your transaction gets buried under more blocks and proof-of-work, the record becomes more permanent and harder to modify.

I'm sorry to say that you have this wrong :&lt; Segwit is a capacity increase, not a scalability improvement. It does create a bigger bus, and has the same effect as increasing the blocksize in nearly all aspects (blocks are bigger on disk, take longer to transmit, take longer to validate, etc) - because *it is* a blocksize increase. But it does create [some awesome possibilities for the future](

Nodes primarily exists for the enforcement of the consensus rules (ideally, such that every participant in the bitcoin economy has a full node that does real-time validation for him), their archival function is secondary (and primarily useful for bootstrapping new nodes to the network, without giving much benefit to the node operator storing all the historical data).

The thing is that there are no real avenues to benefit from ethers that don't go through an exchange. The primary thing these ICOs can do to benefit from their ethers is to sell them off.
With Ethereum, a currency split would mostly just mean another currency ticker symbol showing up on the exchanges, and probably some extra price volatility. Ethereum users are already well accustomed to trading and using an exchange and there should not be too much disruption. And that is indeed what we saw happen - Ethereum went through one of the worse things that can happen to a currency, and no one really cared.
With Bitcoin, OTOH, I can easily imagine tons of confusion and chaos over a currency split. Services like Purse would be disrupted, marketplaces like OpenBazaar, or the various DNMs would have to take a halt as users figure out what happened, BitPay would have to stop merchant processing, remittance service users would have to start learning about this "bitcoin 2" , consumer-oriented wallets like Circle and Xapo (which are not meant for traders and are not really designed to function with multiple cryptocurrencies) would have to start showing a "bitcoin 1 balance" and "bitcoin 2 balance", etc. With ethereum, that ecosystem of services where this matters doesn't really exists yet.

Bruce Fenton is getting it! Bitcoin Core is not a monolithic group of people, it is a process and a community based on the principals of open communications, peer-review, technical merit above all, and a consensus-driven decision-making process.
Just like how we don't artificially break up scientists into rival groups and have them compete with each-other, there's no sense in calling for rival implementations in Bitcoin. Unless the open, consensus-driven process itself is broken, the best possible outcome is to have everyone collaborating under the same roof to bring Bitcoin the best possible solutions.

Isn't that a bit different, though? Sidechains are not consensus-enforced by full nodes, while extension chains are (in other words, miners can steal the sidechain's peg, but can't steal from an extension chain).

Probably around the time of X+144 to X+4320 (one day to one month), as everyone gets their wallet updated from the app store to use the new space offered by SegWit.
But this also highly depends on the actual demand for blockchain space. Even with BU and a max block size of 100mb, the blocks could still be smaller than 1mb in reality due to low demand. So I can't answer definitively, but as I said... if more people want the extra space, they'll upgrade their wallets and start using it in no time.
Note that nearly all wallets have already developed SegWit support, its just a matter of sending out an update: 
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:54:56


Couldn't the same signaling be used to activate both the extchain and segwit on the main chain? (assuming we were okay with delaying SegWit until the time the extchain proposal is designed, developed and tested -- which I'm not sure is acceptable on its own)
Not enabling SegWit on the main-chain is a complete no-go for me.

@_date: 2017-04-25 07:42:43
The way the extension blocks proposal attempts to resolve that is by giving the extchain-&gt;mainchain transaction a cooling period, such that the mainchain output remains unspendable for X blocks (I think they were talking about 100?).
This, of course, is also a serious reduction in usability, especially with old software that won't be upgraded to know about the new cooling rule (a non-upgraded client won't know that it can't use these outputs, so it'll try to and have its transactions stuck for seemingly no reason).

Can you predict how bitcoin users are going to use the system and how much demand there will be for block space?
In the case of a HF to remove the block size limit entirely, we can have blocks that are 10kb, 100kb, 1mb, 5mb or 100mb in size. How can you predict which one it'll be?
@_date: 2016-02-20 16:30:18
For a block consisting of only simple pay-to-pubkey-hash transactions, we get 1.6mb of space. As we use more complex transaction types, we can get up to 4mb. I would say that ~2mb is a good estimate.

I think that this is where your understanding went wrong. The witness commitment (the merkle tree root of the witnesses) *is* being hashed as part of the PoW, meaning that any change to an historical witness will invalidate the entire block.

Under the same argument, would you say that the 21MB coin limit can be lifted as well?

Even with trustless non-federated two-way peg, the security of sidechains is not comparable to that of Bitcoin itself - sidechains, by their very nature, rely on SPV-level security which provides much weaker guarantees and puts a lot more trust in miners (a 51% attacker can do pretty much whatever he wants, including stealing all the coins on the sidechain).
This might be an acceptable trade-off (I personally think that it is, at least for some use-cases), but claiming that sidechains has a "security level comparable with Bitcoin" is just plain wrong.

Miners are operating on relatively low margins and have lots of expenses to be paid out in fiat currencies (electricity, storage, etc), so I wouldn't expect them to be significant holders... at least not significantly more so than other players. I don't think they have any special power in this regard.
You're definitely right in that they can 51% attack the weaker chain, but I do think that an hard-fork changing the PoW function would be realistic in such an extreme scenario.

Is it expected that full-node software could come without the extension chain code bundled in? Extension chains without broad enforcement by full-nodes have properties similar to that of a sidechain (degrading the chain to SPV-level security), which might be acceptable for some use-cases, but not for others.
If this is meant to be opt-in by users such that not everyone has to run it and without bundling it as an inseparable part of full node implementations, why not make it explicit and do it as a sidechain instead?

Right. So isn't "*If there isn't full-node enforcement on the extension chains' rules*" an oxymoron? Either there is full-node enforcment and its an extension chain, or there isn't and its a sidechain.

This is how the free market sorts these things out.

Yikes. Bitcoin should be apolitical money. Making flawed technical changes as a political compromise would set a terrible precedence.
We already have a solution that more than doubles the capacity of the network, which we can activate safely, quickly and with no currency split risk. Why delay the immediate doubling we can have today just so that we can say we hardforked?
SegWit first to relieve some pressure, then we can *calmly* and responsibly start working on future protocol upgrades. We must not hardfork in haste due to the threats by Bitmain.
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:49:39
I'm not talking just about Core developers, but about the scientific community at large. Within that community, there's a wide and clear consensus against an hard-fork to raise the block size limit at this time.
And no, the "longest chain" doesn't win. Miners don't get to dictate the protocol rules, it would be terrible if they did. If the "longest chain" claimed that there should be 1,000 new bitcoins generated every block, these blocks would be flat-out rejected. That's why we follow the "longest **valid** chain", with "valid" being determined by the software being run by every participant of the network.
The miners' job is to order transactions. Nothing more, nothing less. All this talk about them having the authority to change the protocol rules is irresponsible and dangerous.
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:39:29
That "mathematical democracy" you're referring to only gives a voice to the miners, while ignoring the rest of us. This is not acceptable.

I completely agree that "rival implementations" is an important part of how open-source works. In the context of Bitcoin, it also serves as a safeguard against bad actors or bad processes taking over the development of the reference implementation or the protocol.
It's important to differentiate cooperative alternative implementations that are consensus-compatible with each-other and work together under the established open processes, subject themselves to peer-review and use the cross-implementation BIP process, with implementations that attempt to alter protocol rules without consensus and without following the established practices. (we have plenty of the first kind: core, libbitcoin, bitcoinj, bcoin, btcd, knots, bitcore, haskoin, toshi, nbitcoin, pynode, and probably a few more that I'm forgetting)
Rooting for "rival implementations" that are not consensus-compatible as-if its somehow a goal on its own is crazy. Science shouldn't have rivals, only peers cooperating to figure out the best solutions. If the process is broken and we must have a "rival implementation" to fix it - so be it. But otherwise, there's absolutely no sense in splitting our technological experts into rival non-cooperating groups.

That's not true, space taken outside the transaction itself is simply discounted with some factor to incentivize adoption.
@_date: 2017-04-23 10:36:45
No, you can't reveal the pre-image (or any other private data, for that matter) depending on the completion of a transaction (well, you could have someone do it manually, but there's no way for the public network itself to withheld secret info until some time and then release it - its its part of the public blockchain, or its ain't).
What you can do is to make the execution of two transactions atomic (either they both fail or both succeed) by hash-locking one to some piece of information needed to redeem the second. See [atomic cross-chain swaps]( as an example of a contract that uses hash-locks to achieve atomicity.

You're confusing miner consensus\* with economic consensus. It is very likely that a controversial hard-fork being pushed by the miners would get rejected by the users and the other players in the industry. And we do have a defense mechanism against rogue miners - switching the hashing function used for the proof-of-work.
\* Although, I would also claim that 75% is far from "consensus". Perhaps with something like 95% you could call it that.

First of all, the distinction you're trying to make is meaningless. We now have X txs/block, and after SegWit we'll have 2X txs/block.
But also, the distinction you're making is wrong. From the perspective if upgraded nodes, there's no "base witness" and a separate "ride along". It's just one block transmitted together as one blob. The only case where this distinction matters is for old nodes. But once everyone upgrade to the new version, the distinction will be entirely gone.

You can, however, require the user to reveal a pre-image in order to spend the output. You could do something like this:
The oracle says, ahead of time: "after the Team X vs Team Y game on 23 April 2017, if Team X wins I'll publish the pre-image of [some hash A] or if team Y wins I'll publish the pre-image of [some other hash B]"
Then, if Bob wants to bet on Team X and Alice wants to bet on Team Y, they'll deposit funds into a script that says:
    [2-of-(Bob and Alice)] OR
    [signed by Bob AND provides pre-image of hash A] OR
    [signed by Alice AND provides pre-image of hash B]
That way, they can either co-sign a transaction cooperatively, or use the pre-image revealed by the oracle to sign a transaction releasing the funds to themselves.
This only works for "winner takes all" situations - there's no way to split the output according to the outcome published by the oracle, only give one of the parties full control over it.

Brian really needs to clarify the bet to only be valid if the hard-fork is contentious... if the hard-fork goes through with ecosystem-wide consensus, the support of the scientific community and follows the advice of the technical experts, it will probably be fine.

It's because we don't have watchtowers yet. If you're only sending, the prior states would always represent a worse state for the other party to the channel, so he has no reason to try and broadcast any of the old states. This way, you can be offline indefinitely without the risk of funds loss.
Eventually, this will be resolved with watchtowers. Your wallet would contact several different watchtower services and have them watch the chain for cheating attempts. If they catch a cheating attempt and respond on your behalf, they get a fee.

This is true for every soft-fork, not specifically to segwit. Following a soft-fork activation there's some reduced security for non-upgraded nodes and to SPV clients, but miners are very quick to upgrade once that 95% threshold is getting near - they would be wasting lots of money if they didn't. Our experience from multiple soft-fork deployments has shown that this mechanism works very well in practice.
Interestingly to note, this isn't different at all from the effect caused by SPV mining (mining empty blocks on top of unvalidated blocks). According to some recent research [0] [1], roughly 6.1% [2] of the network hash-rate is being wasted on empty blocks which do not enforce consensus rules, which has more negative effect compared to that of &lt;5% non-upgraded miners following a soft-fork activation (which would only not validate segwit-enabled txs, while SPV miners *won't validate anything*).
Taking this into consideration, I would say that the more worrying aspect of segwit is raising the effective block size limit, which could worsen the situation with SPV mining even further (the larger the block, the more time it takes to transmit/validate it, the longer the miners would be SPV mining). Fortunately, the Bitcoin development community has taken steps to mitigate the negative effects of raising the block size (primarily, libsecp256k1 &amp; compact blocks), which I hope should suffice to counter-effect the block size increase planned as part of segwit.

Huh? That's exactly how we got p2sh and the recently added new op codes into bitcoin...


All of that was possible with P2SH, too.


This is not what I was talking about at all. I was talking about the fact that with SPV mining, the miners don't validate the transactions in the previous block *at all*, which is far worse than not validating *just the segwit txs*.


This is not true. Validating the headers does not in any way guarantee that there won't be a fork. A block with valid headers and proof-of-work, but invalid transactions *will* eventually get rejected by the network, alongside any block that's built on top of it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:30:11
They lost whatever balance they had left-over in the channel they were trying to attack. Lightning nodes won't let the balance of the other party reach zero, exactly so that they'll have something to lose from broadcasting an old state.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:52:15
There's a tremendous amount of trust placed in TLS certificate authorities, while there's basically no trust involved at all with Lightning payment routers (the worse that can happen is some slight delay in getting your funds back). I don't think they're comparable and don't see any reason that wallets would need to hardcode specific nodes into the software (unless they're restricting their users on purpose as part of some fishy business model, perhaps).

Are you familiar with the [fidelity bonds]( concept? It's quite similar to your idea, only that the deposit is non-refundable (spent on mining fees to prove that a sacrifice was made).

Most popular wallets today use centralized API servers to fetch blockchain data. The ones that use SPV are exceptional — BreadWallet and Android Bitcoin Wallet are the only popular SPV wallets I’m aware of, while Mycelium, Blockchain.info, Electrum, GreenAddress and AirBitz use the trusted-server model and not the P2P SPV.
Mike's image suggesting that 99.3% of Bitcoin users would auto-switch to 2X is incredibly misleading given that that the majority of Bitcoin users depend on full nodes (whether theirs or someone else’s) and not on SPV security.

Very good! At Bitrated, we also took care not to load any external resources as part of our webpages, not even analytics. Everything is loaded directly from our webserver, with the only exception being the Vimeo iframe on the homepage (and even that only happens on click). 
This isn't just a privacy issue - there are *major* security issues with executing third party scripts under the context of your domain, especially when dealing with private keys in the client side. Any script loaded can access everything the user can, read private keys and make actions on behalf of the user.
From our testing, the majority of Bitcoin services don't take that into consideration at all. Whenever you're using a web wallet that embeds Google Analytics, Google, or any agency that can coerce them with a warrant, can gain full access to your funds. I'm very delighted to see CoinKite isn't one of these wallets.

To claim that Bitcoin can reach VISA scale, it needs to be able to handle its peak capacity, not just the average capacity.
However, according to [this source]( it appears like the 56k number is their theoretical limit and not what they actually process in peak times. The maximum capacity they actually handle appears to be about 20k tx/s (or at least it was two years ago, probably higher now).
So, yes, my numbers were wrong and should be divided by 3 (but not by 28). Still, even with that correction, this is far beyond the reach of most users, and would still doom Bitcoin to a centralized structure.

To anyone wondering, here's some back of the napkin math:
- VISA can clear [56,000]( transactions per second.
- For Bitcoin to handle this capacity would require blocks of roughly 20 gigabytes, or about 1 petabyte (one million gigabytes) per year.
- The storage costs (for 1 petabyte) alone, disregarding bandwidth, RAM and CPU, would be roughly $30k/month on AWS S3 (which is pretty cheap, possibly cheaper than the DIY costs for storing that at home)
So, no, Bitcoin could never reach VISA scale using on-chain transactions (well, at least not while still being decentralized).

Yes, you're absolutely right! We are working on an API to allow integration into third-party marketplaces and services (both for the payment system and the reputation engine), and have some very exciting partnerships to announce once the API rolls out.
We're respecting our users' privacy and are not looking at the specific details of the trades (and, in fact, plan to encrypt it end-to-end so that we couldn't look into such details even if we wanted to do), so I cannot describe anything specific about the type of transactions being conducted.
@_date: 2015-09-27 22:13:41
This is currently not possible using Bitrated, but we do have some future plans to provide tools to help our users deal with the volatility.
One possibility is to allow shifting the volatility risk to the buyer instead of the seller. For that, the buyer would pay an extra of, say, 20%, on top of the exchange rate at the time of payment. Then, the bitcoins would be released to the seller according to the exchange rate at the release time, and the spare coins would be sent back to the buyer as change. This would protect the seller against volatility of up to 20% (or whichever number the buyer/seller are comfortable with).
With that model, the buyer would take the volatility on himself. If bitcoin dropped in price, it falls on the buyer. OTOH, if bitcoin raised in price, the buyer would end up taking some profit, too.
Some more advanced models could allow splitting the volatility risk between the buyer and seller, rather than them falling solely on one party.
Another, more complex, alternative is to integrate a CFD market into our payment system, which would (given a liquid enough market) eliminate the volatility risk altogether, and shift the burden of dealing with it from the our users to professional traders who are more equipped for that.

I might be missing something completely obvious here, but that "you don't need the whole history, just get the utxos from random peers, and if they lie to you, its okay - you'll just see the transaction doesn't get confirmed" argument makes no sense to me and has circular logic. For other nodes to know that the transaction isn't valid, they must hold their own valid copy of the history. If everyone [or large parts of the network] behave in the manner he's describing, Bitcoin would be utterly broken. You'll have nodes that have no way to know which transactions are valid and should be relayed/mined, other than trusting other nodes to do so (and, again, not being able to validate they're behaving correctly).
Also, his "this is the same behavior we already have today due to the possibility of double spend" argument seems nonsensical. How are these two completely different scenarios the same?
Finally, the two explanations he's giving for why people claim Bitcoin scales as `O(n^2)` are explanations that I never saw before anywhere... the explanation that is being commonly used (which originated from ~~adam, I believe~~ peter, I'm being told) is referenced only at the end.
I must be missing something here, right? Can someone please help me make sense out of this? That whole post seems to be really, utterly, obviously, factually wrong.
Edit: for the first point, this could *perhaps* make *some* sense as a low-security high-trust*full*ness wallet mode where you blindly trust miners. But then, you just drop to SPV-level security, which we already have. Fetching the utxos set, when you know you can't trust them, doesn't add anything to the equation.

Bitrated facilities 2-of-3 multi-signature transactions for the purpose of arbitration. The main difference from traditional escrow solutions is that the trusted third party does not hold any funds, cannot control them on his own and cannot take them to himself (or, cannot be taken by someone who gains unauthorized access to his keys).
Basically, he gets a voting right that allows him to tilt the outcome in favor of either the buyer or the seller, and noting more. Legally speaking, this is considered a binding arbitration contract, rather than an escrow service, which makes this much easier regulation-wise to the third party.

Not with O(1) block propagation, which some miners already have today as part of a private network.


Yes, large blocks could eliminate some of the smaller players and decrease the competition for mining rewards.


Not really, the only real cost is the increased chance of an orphaned block, which isn't very large if you're a big miner (or cooperate on a private O(1) block propagation network with the big miners).
For miners, there are no costs in terms of transaction fees (as they collect the fees themselves).

Greg (and others) have formally proven that fully decentralized consensus (not specifically Bitcoin, as you claim -- in the case of Greg, it was in the context of consensus in Wikipedia) is impossible, which it indeed is. Bitcoin was able to sidestep these proofs by introducing the concept of "mining majority" and reducing the security requirements from cryptographic security to economic security based on game-theory and financial incentives.
Greg explains some more of the background on that here:

I would consider it distributed rather than decentralized, but that's besides the point. I was referring to the potential capacity of on-chain transactions, disregarding the potential advancements in off-chain solutions (lighting network et al.).
Also, I would say that off-chain payment channels solutions are *almost* completely trustless, but not entirely, due to the potential denial of service and *temporary* fund freeze attacks. (I still think they're an awesome scalability solution, though)
@_date: 2016-10-18 05:36:42
The main point is that trying to compete with centralized payment processors in terms of throughput and efficiency is a lost cause, as they can eventually be far better, technology-wise, than any decentralized payment system ever could (we should thank god that they're so bad at what they do that we are currently able to beat them at cost/efficiency even while being decentralized), and that we should focus on the benefits that Bitcoin-the-currency brings to the market instead.

Implementing segwit has nothing to do with Schnorr. While Schnorr can indeed give them additional space savings, this has nothing to do with the capacity boost and fee reduction already brought by segwit. In addition, segwit is available _now_, while Schnorr is still in the planning stages and far from a concrete implementation, not to mention activation. Bundling the two together doesn't make technical sense and reads like a poor excuse for delaying segwit.

If bitcoin nodes were to accept the 'first to validate' block instead of the 'first seen' block (as BU is suggesting), this would make this problem even worse, because now miners would have to take the block validation time into consideration as well (and not just the propagation time, as it is with the first-seen policy).

It allows for a blackmail situation. The moment after funds are locked, either party can go to the other and say: "Look. I'm not going to complete this deal, ever. Here's a signed transaction where I steal 50% of your deposits \*, and let you keep the other 50%. You can either sign it too and broadcast it, and recover some of your losses, or you can kiss your deposits good bye. I will not be answering any future messages to this email address. Bye bye."
Now, whether this would work or not depends on human psychology and how likely users are to surrender to such blackmail in exchange for recovering some of their loss. If enough people resist the urge, then these kinds of attacks would become unprofitable and the attackers would eventually stop. My hunch is that most people will think only about themselves wanting to recover *something* rather than consider the greater good, and that these attacks will be profitable.

19 is even a smaller sample than the 25 we previously used and which I already said to be too small. You have even more bias here because contributors that are not affiliated with bitcoin companies are less likely to come to physical meetings, and Blockstream are among the only companies to help sponsor contributors working on open-source development.
This is an unfortunate side-effect of the costs associated with global transportation, which makes it more difficult for unaffiliated contributors to attend physical meetings. But fortunately, it doesn't have a big effect here since the Bitcoin development community heavily relies on online communication to steer development and conduct its consensus-driven decision-making process, and uses face-to-face meetings on rare occasions as a bonus.
If we started seeing that more decision making starts to take place in physical meetings and away from the open, public, available-for-all mailing lists / GitHub / IRC, then I'd start to be worried (especially if the attendees would be mostly representatives of heavily funded companies, Blockstream or otherwise).

Only for segwit-enabled blocks. The miners can still produce non-segwit blocks after segwit activates, they just won't be able to include any segwit transactions in it. It'll be pretty odd that they do this and will probably raise suspicion of AB usage, though...
If we want to block AB entirely using a soft-fork, we either need to make SegWit-enabled blocks mandatory (they won't have to contain any segwit txs though, just the WTXID commitment), or add a separate WTXID commitment structure somewhere.

There are ways to reduce the volatility risks. One way is hedging using CFDs, which we're investigating as a long-term solution.
A simpler alternative that's probably going to be implemented sooner, is to have contracts denominated in different currencies/assets, and have the buyer pay an extra X% BTC into the multisig, based on the exchange rate at the time of payment. Then, when the funds are released to the seller, the updated exchange rate is used to determine the final payout amount, with the rest returned to the buyer as change. This basically means that the buyer shifts the volatility risk to himself (up to a certain pre-determined X% price swing), but also enjoys the potential gains if Bitcoin goes up in value. A more sophisticated model could also split the volatility loss/gains between the parties, as a sort of a mutual volatility insurance.

To be more precise, wherever you're getting the .onion address from becomes your CA. If its from a comment on Reddit, then the commenter and Reddit are effectively your CA (along with your ISP if there's no SSL, or with reddit.com's SSL CA if there's). Whether this is better or worse than how traditional CA works is open for debate, but it definitely didn't eliminate the trusted-party requirement for identifying the server's key.


If it ends up being served by the same servers and the same infrastructure as the non-.onion address, which is likely the case, then it doesn't really add much, security and anti-DoS wise. Agreed that it could be useful if they were to be using a completely separate backend (web servers, databases, load balancers, bitcoind nodes, etc) for that (at least for anti-DoS, not quite sure what are the other security advantages).
All in all, I agree that its definitely not dangerous and doesn't do any harm, but I'm not convinced that using .onion addresses for services ran on known servers and by known operators is actually useful in any way.
Would love to be proven wrong, though :) If I am, I'll make sure to setup a .onion version of Bitrated.

LN channels can remain open indefinitely, they don't have a pre-set expiration time. They continue to operate until one of the parties decides to close them. (this is made possible with the relative locktime feature being added to Bitcoin)

Bitrated has no fees either, except for the fees (optionally) charged by the arbitrator (many of them don't, at least for the case where no dispute arises. I would also say that a completely free arbitration solution is not really sustainable - the dispute resolution process could take significant time and resources from the arbitrator, why would anyone devote that without a financial incentive?).
It is also worth mentioning that Bitrated doesn't hold any keys in the multi-signature and does not provide arbitration services directly - instead, we offer a marketplace where anyone can list their services as an arbitrator, alongside a reputation management system to help find reputable arbitrators.
BTW, Bitrated v1 didn't require signup either. But that also meant that we couldn't provide any UI to show the users' active trades, instead relying on the user keeping everything in bookmarks and text files. Switching to an account-based approach was one of the highest requested features, which is why it was implemented in Bitrated v2.
Regarding the ease of use - we're very receptive to feedback and would love to hear suggestions on improving our UI and UX. If anyone has any feedback, we'd love to hear about it! I can be reached directly at nadav
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:57:38
It is not decentralized, but we are designing Bitrated in a way that requires putting [as little trust as possible]( on the service operator. Every identity is backed by public-key cryptography, and every action (such as posting a rating, agreeing to a contract or updating the profile) is digitally signed by the user. That proves the authenticity of data, prevents unauthorized modifications by third parties (including by Bitrated itself) and makes this interpolate nicely with p2p decentralized systems who wants to process this data. In addition, everything is accessible via [open APIs]( for easy replication and archiving.
Going one step further and implementing the reputation engine as a decentralized application is definitely something that we're considering for the future, once we have more resources available to dedicate to this. Building a decentralized reputation system that is reliable, efficient and sybil-resistant requires considerably more time and resources than a centralized-but-trustless system. This compromise allowed us to deliver a working product that solves users needs much sooner, while not compromising on security and minimizing the shortcomings of centralization.
We'll open-source the client-side code and our shared libraries code pretty soon, probably within the next month or so. We're still not sure about the server-side code, primarily due to security considerations.

You're still treating that top 25 list as-if it was the full list of Bitcoin developers. As I already stated:
- That list is in no way comprehensive; there are far more than 25 contributors on the Bitcoin Core development community. It's 6 developers out of around 40-50 (regulars, hundreds if we're looking at the entire project's lifetime), which is 13%. Of these 6, a few are not at all in a dominant position within the social &amp; trust graph of the Bitcoin development community.

1) This advantage is blocking us from making improvements to the bitcoin protocol (not just segwit, it conflicts with many other proposals on the pipeline too)
2) This advantage is protected by a patent and cannot be used by others. A patented-protected advantage that lowers energy costs by 20% will result in the patent owner and its business partners being the only ones able to mine at a profit, and eventually in the complete centralization of the network.

That $1.7 trillion figure doesn't appear to include things like exchange fees, its strictly payment processing fees.
Edit: and it doesn't include inflation either... I don't think that comparing it with miner revenues is right either, you should be comparing it with actual fees paid by end users, excluding costs of inflation and money depreciation.
Edit 2: oh, you did write down the total miner transaction fees, but as "fees paid to exchanges"... what does exchanges have to do with this?

70% of the miners using AsicBoost would still give them an advantage over the other 30%... why does it have to be a minority?
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:00:05
There's plenty of space for these willing to pay 50-60 satoshis/byte (roughly $0.05 for the median transaction size), which is still extremely cheap.
The only reason blocks are currently full is that miners still accept transactions paying extremely small fees, making the block size a terrible estimate for network load. The only number that should matter is how much users have to pay to get their transaction confirmed - and that number is still very, very, very low.

Very true. Another interesting angle is that if your goal isn't making a digital, decentralized, censorship-resistance currency, "blockchain technology" is a terribly inefficient way of doing things compared to the myriad of less-sexy, less-buzzy solutions already possible and available since the time before Satoshi's whitepaper.
I find it very funny that the banking industry view "blockchain technology" as The Next Big Thing™ and Bitcoin as an "unfortunate requirement" to get rid of, while Bitcoin developers view the blockchain as an "inefficient consequence" necessary for the creation of the true objective - a digital, decentralized, censorship-resistance currency, aka Bitcoin.

Strong development community and network effects.
@_date: 2016-05-24 04:27:38
There are many non-economical transactions that would go away rather than pay higher fees; this includes mixing scripts to hide the origins of money (to be replaced with coinjoin), gambling sites that use the blockchain to track user balances (to be replaced with internal account balances), inefficient use of "bitcoin 2.0" meta protocols (to be replaced with efficient protocols), faucets (to be killed), data storage (to be killed), messaging (to be killed), etc.
Once you take all of these away and only leave transactions made by actual users trying to transfer value, we will be FAR OFF from the blocksize limit. If usage grows to the level where these kind of transactions, that have proper fees attached to them, fill up the capacity of the blockchain - THEN we will have a problem. But by then we'll already have SegWit, and probably LN too. The easiest metric we can use to determine whether we're getting near that point is the satoshis/byte that has to be paid to get included in the near block - which shows that everything is just fine. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:04:38


The top 20 is just an arbitrary number, I could just as well chosen 10 or whatever other number. I was trying to measure "how many of the highly involved contributors are from blockstream", and 25 seemed like too much for "highly involved". Trying to paint this as disingenuous on my part is quite unfair, as I did explicitly mention the total number of Blockstream contributors later in the very same paragraph.


That is due to a difference in what we consider as "potentially being influenced by Blockstream". I count employees and shareholders, you also want to count freelancers.
Fine. Even with Luke counted in, we're talking about 7 out of 40-50 developers. This still far off from "*more than a third*". Far off as in "more than double than the actual number" far off.


Are you serious? You're going to use "he didn't refute it" as an evidence of it being true? Come on...
Not to mention that Greg did explicitly state that Luke has no shared in Blockstream. What more do you want?


A good summary would be that Blockstream has a significant involvement in Bitcoin Core development because it was founded by a bunch of the top long-time contributors that wanted the funding to allow them to dedicate themselves to Bitcoin development. And yet, this involvement is less than half of what was claiming.
Edit: And even if we only count the people on that list and go with your definition, we're still talking about 7 out of 25 - which is still 16% less than what  was claiming. (re-edited the edit - I mixed up some numbers)

You underpaid the mining fee by about 60%. Your transaction has 17 satoshis/byte, while the current recommended fee is 50-60 satoshis/byte. The other transaction might've been smaller, which made the 0.0001 in fees sufficient. (the transaction you linked to is 583 bytes long, about 2.3x the size of the median transaction)
Try a better wallet next time and you shouldn't experience any delays.

What's Craig's interest in discrediting members of the Bitcoin development community? Trying to go out against Core and well-known personas would only make his job claiming to be Satoshi harder. I do not see how this fits his agenda, unless the agenda is bigger than we think.
The orchestrated comes primarily from the effort that must've gone into tricking Gavin, Matonis, Ian and JVP. I do not believe that this would've been possible without significant resources and expertise at his disposal. This, in addition to the massive on-going blocksize campaign, online community manipulation (sockpuppets &amp; voting), the smear campaign against Core and other respected members of the community, and now - the ties between Craig and that smear campaign, makes me believe that there's a something bigger here at play that connects all the dots.

Segwit already is 2MB. It makes no sense to take the considerable risks and logistics challenge of deploying a hardfork just for a simple constant change that doesn't do much except for pleasing Bitmain. When we do have an hardfork, it's going to need much [more upside]( than that to be worth it.

What do you figure from Wright's involvement in the blocksize debate and his participation in the smearing campaign against Bitcoin Core, as can be understood from his authorship of that document? This doesn't fit in the picture at all for me.
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:10:38
It is proof of stake. The sampling isn't very great, and as in all voting systems, you have a bias towards people who are actively engaged in the subject or have an agenda to promote.
However, Bitcoinocracy has been advertised pretty heavily here and on r/btc. If Classic supporters had bitcoins to put where their mouth is, they would surely have done it by now. Just look at how much effort they spent on manipulating a metric that's easily Sybil-attackable (node count, which recently [dropped in nearly an half]( because of *one guy* who stopped maintaining his pseudo-nodes on AWS).
Edit: you can also look at the current hashing power (not easily Sybil-attackable) and to the voting that was made on mining pools (also, not easily Sybil-attackable) to see that Core has tremendous support. Basically, the only places where it might appear otherwise are places that are easily susceptible to Sybil attacks - message boards, twitter, online (non-hashpower-backed) polls, trollboxes, etc.

We published some more relevant information here: 
Reddit thread: 
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:43:51
These arguments apply to both sides of the debate, and I see no reason why it would be skewed in favor of either side. They should roughly detract the same amount of votes from both sides.
Classic supporters have shown that they're willing to go through great lengths to promote their ideas and are much more passionate and emotional about this debate than most Core supporters. If anything, I would expect a voting system like this to be skewed in their favor - meaning that the actual numbers for Core support might be higher than what we're seeing on Bitcoinocracy.
Edit: also, its quite odd that you *"do not want to ... [do things that might harm your privacy/security]"*, yet you announce to the world how many bitcoins you're holding and associate that with your two years old reddit account (meaning that its probably associated with your real-world identity, if someone bothered looking closely enough), which harms both your privacy and security, and makes you a potential target for blackmail?

A compromise would set the precedence that the miners are able to throw a tantrum and coerce the network into accepting protocol rule changes. If Bitcoin were to activate a technically defective protocol upgrade as a political compromise, against the will of the community and the advice of our technical experts, I would have no trust in the ability of Bitcoin to uphold any other rules and no interest in participating in such system.
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:51:08
I'm not entirely sure what kind of proof they asked for (I'm only aware of Gavin making information about the procedure publicly available), but even if you're right - Craig couldn't have predicted the level of scrutiny they'll put him through. Failing a live demonstration could've been devastating to his cause. He would have to be prepared for the worse case scenario once he puts himself in this situation. My guess would be pre-rigged computers that were re-factory-sealed in a state where they still boot up into the initial Windows installation (which is tricky due to secure boot), as well as various stores that such computers could be bought from if the victim insists on going to the store.
I do not doubt for a second that there are real participants in the smear campaign. Even if someone is orchestrating this, public perception and crowd control is the game here. Getting real people to jump on the wagon is a crucial element of a campaign like that.
I was on the fence regarding whether everything we saw over the last months was a naturally occurring phenomena of the Bitcoin community, or something that's being carefully planned and executed by some external entity. Until Craig and learning of his connection to the smear campaign, I leaned towards the former. I've now changed my mind.
I agree that this cannot be concluded definitively from the evidence at hand, but seeing that Craig has been part of the smear campaign since at least December and that he's fiercely advocating for bigger blocks (both directly and via the anonymous paper) strongly suggests that he's part of that campaign and that there's something more going on than a simple internal power struggle.
I didn't say that Craig is the one orchestrating this, though. I also believe that he's just a pawn in this game.

We both know that this is bigger than just me. People in the Israeli Bitcoin community have been talking about paying Bitmain Israel a visit for several months now. As you probably are aware, members of the Israeli Bitcoin community participated in activism protesting against Israeli banks, so the decision to apply that same model to Bitmain was quite straightforward and natural. I’m not your problem. I just helped put up some signs. The problem is Bitmain aggressive, bullying behaviour that causes that response from the community .

 &gt; This leads to two conclusions: First, we need to resolve the situation, we can’t remain in the current situation indefinitely. If a compromise is what it takes to move forward, so be it.
You have an hidden assumption there: that appeasing Bitmain by letting political compromises dictate protocol rules is the only way to get SegWit activated.
It is not. Accepting this as an axiom is the only reason this debate is going nowhere. As long as Bitmain participates in the discussions while everyone else on the table accept their veto power and that they must be appeased in order to move forward, they will continue acting irrationally and non-collaboratively.
Getting back to the discussion under the mutual understanding that decisions are only ever made with "rough consensus and running code" (and specifically: that rough consensus can be achieved despite Bitmain's objection), and never by lobbying for company support behind closed doors and approving proposals in a top-down manner, is the only way to get this conflict resolved.
Take away Bitmain's veto power, then discuss. It won't go anywhere positive otherwise.


There are other 2x-3x increases in the form of softforks on the pipeline. Shouldn't we start with it first?
Also, shouldn't we see the effects of doubling the capacity before comitting to further increases?


Exactly! Shouldn't we try to batch them together in a planned-out manner, rather than doing one-trick pony hardforks?

Note that Bitrated itself is not the arbitrator to the transactions - users are free to choose whichever arbitrator they want. But your point still stands, private keys are under the full control of the users and can be recovered to regain access to the funds.

Great question, thanks for bringing this up! We're in the process of writing a post to clarify the current situation regarding the DDoS and funds held in the system, but to give you a quick answer -
The private keys used in the multi-signature scripts are directly derived from the users' passwords (generated mnemonic &amp; user-provided password). This ensures that funds are always under the full control of the user and will never not be lost, even in the worse case scenario of Bitrated becoming permanently unavailable.
That being said, there's currently no easy way to recover the private keys from the passwords., but we'll soon be releasing a tool to help users do that. This has long been on our TODO list, but the DDoS has pushed this up on our priority list.
If anyone has funds held up in the system and need to urgently release them, please reach out to us for help at support If it's not super urgent and can wait for a little while, please allow us for some time to publicly release the tool for that. Thanks!

According to bitcoinfees.21.co's recommended fee rate of 50-60 satoshis/byte, a fee of 0.000205 bitcoins would've gotten your transaction confirmed in the nearest block. That's $0.09 instead of the $0.06 you paid, which is still dirt cheap.
Also, keep in mind that your transaction is relatively big. For the current median transaction size of 256 bytes, your fee should've been enough for inclusion in the nearest block.
You should switch to a better wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-19 08:47:54
$0.25 is way too high. according to  $0.06-$0.07 (for an 256 average bytes transaction) would get you confirmed in the nearest block.

The other extreme side of that, if we just bump the blocksize whenever we're near full capacity, is that companies wouldn't have any incentive whatsoever to use the blockchain in an efficient manner, wallets won't need to implement proper fee handling, and no work would be dedicated towards real scaling solutions. And that is exactly what we saw happening until very recently. It is necessary that we hit the block size limit to incentivize work on these areas (and I'm saying that as a founder of a Bitcoin company that had to deal with these issues).

When read in the full context, its clear that he's definitely advocating for bigger blocks and referring to 340gb blocks on a "network shared by banks and large companies" as a good thing.
Craig is being quoted by the press as saying one of the sentences in that report. The only scenario where he didn't write it is that he stumbled onto that report somewhere on the internet and decided to copy-paste from it into his press kit... which is quite unlikely. And besides, who would go through the trouble of writing a full academic article just for the sake of pissing Greg off?
I might've gone a little too far with my tinfoil-hattery near the end there, but it is clear that Craig is taking part in the smear campaign against the technical community. Which is a very strange behavior on his part - getting along with leading figures of the community would make the Satoshi scam much easier to pull off. Why create enemies? What possible reason could he have to participate in the smearing? What kind of agenda is he trying to push here?
There's something else going on... him taking part and picking sides in the blocksize wars make no sense whatsoever.

Not quite... Coinb.in is a general-purpose multi-signature tool that allows to create all kinds of different m-of-n scripts, while Bitrated is specifically optimized for the case of 2-of-3 arbitration contracts. I would say that Bitrated is more convenient, UX-wise, for the case of 2-of-3 arbitration, while Coinb.in is better for cases where you need the flexibility to create different kinds of contracts.
Also, Bitrated itself does not directly provide arbitration services. Instead, it provides a reputation system and a directory of available arbitrators to choose from.

The old Bitrated v1 release (back from '13) worked like that. Only arbitrators signed up to be listed on the marketplace, with buyers &amp; sellers using unique one-time URLs to keep track of their trades. Bitrated v1 had no concept of accounts, identities, ratings or trust scores.
This, however, came at a price - the usability really suffered due to that. We were unable to even do something as simple as showing a list of active trades to the user. The feedback we received was that its an awkward way to keep track of transactions, and that users wanted to have an account they can log in to and a dashboard that shows them all of their trades. Based on that feedback, the v2 release was changed to focus around accounts, which also works nicely in combination with the new rating system.
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:46:12
They are uneconomical because they do not provide enough user-value to justify paying for their block space. With the majority of the cases I mentioned, this is quite clear-cut - faucet payments are too tiny to be worth their costs (both for the initial payment and for later including the tiny output in a tx), mixing transactions don't move any value around nor provide any real anonymity gains, yet requires tons of separate transactions and lots of fees (and that is while a much better anonymity solution exists, that even has the added benefit of overall cheaper transaction costs [coinjoin]), etc.
Yes, with some of the cases I mentioned, the user value might be more subjective and we might see users that are willing to pay competitive fees to keep these use-cases possible. But the general idea stands - there are many inefficient uses of the blockchain that would simply go away as the bitcoin network starts charging more realistic fees. It might made sense to use the blockchain as an alternative to an internal ledger of user balances on gambling sites (and even send a single satoshi transaction back, just as a way to tell the user he lost!), but it is becoming clear that this is not a realistic way to use the blockchain.

Can definitely confirm - we will be providing sexy looking badges to put on 3rd party websites :) Still not settled on a design, but they'll provide more information than just the Bitrating score itself and so will look differently than what's currently on the FAQ page (though, the current Bitrating-in-an-hexagon design might be a part of the entire badge).
And yes - fake stores popping up is something we have thought about, and should be of major concern for the Bitcoin world. With the traditional financial system, consumers can feel relatively safe buying from a random website they stumbled onto on Google, knowing that their bank and credit card provider is there to look out for them. It's also not really possible to setup such fake storefronts - the credit card companies will shut you down rather quickly. With Bitcoin, however, its a very different story and the need to build up trust with the merchant is much more crucial.
(BTW, we are still working on linking Facebook business pages. Sorry for this taking longer than anticipated!)

If a group of major Bitcoin exchanges starts enforcing blacklisting (refusing to accept certain coins), fungibility will be harmed without doubt, regardless of whether you're using their services directly or not. It will spread like HIV - anyone who wants to deal with exchanges, or deal  with someone who wants to deal with exchanges, or deal with someone who wants to deal with someone who wants to deal with exchanges, ..., will have to start caring about these blacklists. Very soon, that blacklist won't be enforced just by the exchanges, but also by merchants, unrelated bitcoin services and individuals.

That's exactly my point. Some companies would find it unprofitable to buy the licensing and would not enter into such an agreement.


That's absolutely not fine. You've just monopolized the position of 2 or 3 companies to control the mining market without any viable outside competition.


You're completely overlooking the fact that a large chunk of the current network hashrate is being manufactured AND operated by the same company. Almost all ASIC manufactures are also miners nowadays. And when they do sell, its usually to large mining facilities that buys them in bulk. The days of consumer ASIC are pretty much over.

- I did say that a total of 6-7 of all contributors are employed by Blockstream - even higher than your count. What did I miscount?
- Luke was never a co-founder at Blockstream. You seem to be getting your misinformation [from here]( where the author eventually acknowledges that he [was pulling facts out of his behinds]( (TL;DR Luke was one of the 9 authors of the sidechains whitepaper, but "was not issued any stock [in blockstream]" and has no relation with them other than taking some freelance work from them).
- I do not count freelance work as being hired by them. Luke receives (received?) a small amount of his income from Blockstream, and is not dependent on them for his livelihood in the way employees are.
- That list is in no way comprehensive; there are far more than 25 contributors on the Bitcoin Core development community. It's 6 developers out of around 40-50 (regulars, hundreds if we're looking at the entire project's lifetime), which is 13%. Of these 6, a few  are not at all in a dominant position within the social &amp; trust graph of the Bitcoin development community.
- Why should we take out Gavin because he no longer has commit access? The majority of the contributors on this list don't have (and never had) commit access. Also, there are also a few other people on that list contributed in the past and moved on since besides Satoshi and Mike. You can't exclude just Gavin and include all the non-active members besides Satoshi and Mike just because it fits your agenda.

You can. After linking the account and proving ownership over it, we no longer require having an active authorization. Note, however, that we try to ask for the minimum permissions required to identify your public account, so we usually (depending on how fine-grained the permissions are with the account provider) don't have permissions to read your private information or to make actions on your behalf.
We'll look into the Coinbase issue, thanks for letting us know about that!

For the purpose of *including and ordering transactions*. Miners were never meant to be the guardians over the protocol rules, or have any other power over the network's users.
Understanding that Bitcoin was designed in a way that a [51% attacker can't really do that much]( (because we're depending on them *only* for the purpose of including and ordering transactions, and nothing else) was a major reason for me to get involved with Bitcoin. If it weren't the case, Bitcoin would be a very vulnerable, uninteresting system.

Yes, rating systems (like any other system that's highly depended on user-generated content) indeed have a strong network effects factor and do suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem.
But Bitrated is not just a rating system, and the other features that it has could help it build up adoption and bootstrap the rating system. Primarily:
1. The payment system provides buyer protection and is useful to consumers as a standalone service, regardless of the reputation system. Users coming for the payment system are likely to start adding ratings as well.
2. The reputation system allows users, as an opt-in, to leverage their existing online persona and past internet activity into measurable reputation. We're using that to help build trust and bootstrap the system while reviews and vouches are getting built up.
Thanks for the excellent question!

As a followup to my [other comment]( here, here's a more direct answer:


No. But we're exploring this option and are building Bitrated in a way that would be compatible with a future decentralized system.
Building a decentralized reputation system is a nontrivial feat that requires considerably more time &amp; effort, and we believe that the Bitcoin ecosystem needs a solution for consumer protection as early as possible. We preferred to have a working product that solves user's needs, even if it meant going with a centralized model.


Partially. Every action you make on the website is signed by your key, which is managed using client-side technology. This means that we cannot rate users on your behalf, accept contracts for you or even update your profile (if we did, we would not have a matching digital signature to authenticate it, and users could easily tell that it did not originate from you). Additionally, we cannot touch any user funds, intervene in any trades, or change the trust agent's decision.
While we did our best to minimize trust and are not aware of any other web-based service that matches our level of trustlessness, there are three main things that still require trusting us:
1. You need to trust our servers to serve you with the correct JavaScript code that matches the published open-source repo.
2. Currently, Bitrated servers as a CA for your identity's public key.
3. Censorship on the information published on Bitrated might be hard to detect.
All of these issues are things that we heavily considered, and we do have proposed solutions that are planned to be implemented in the future. The ["Trustless Server Model"]( section of our security page has some more information on that.

Hum, that doesn't sound very good.. I would really prefer to see private key and digital signatures handling done on the client rather than on the server. Many people are (very likely) going to out-source the liability of running the server part to third-party provides, and therefore surrender their keys to them - which is really quite unnecessary, given that all private-keys related operations can be done in-browser.

OpenBazaar does intend to add a reputation system (based on a web-of-trust network similar to ours) in the future. Even with multi-signature and assuming the possibility of a perfect dispute resolution process that can never be gamed - how would you choose an arbitrator that is trustworthy and honest without a reputation system?
Regarding identity - users are free to use a pseudonym identity. We do not force, validate or encourage using real-world identities in any way. See [bitrated.com/faq
Regarding transaction history - while there are some things that we do know, we plan on minimizing them as much as possible. For example, the description and contract fields of trades are going to be encrypted end-to-end (using the user's keys and an [ECDH library]( I've been working on).
Regarding centralization - while Bitrated is a centralized service, we do strive to make it as trustless as possible. Many of the advantages offered by decentralized solutions can in fact be achieved by leveraging cryptography in a centralized service. See [here]( and [here]( for more details on our trustless server model.

No system can ever prevent fraud completely, and past behavior is definitely not always an indicator of future behavior.
However, our goal is not to make fraud impossible, but rather to make it uneconomical. By making trusted identities harder and costlier to obtain, we could make the cost of gaining trust and defrauding users higher than the potential returns from doing so.
An attacker on the Bitrated platform would find it quite challenging to create new trusted identities every other day and throwing them away, because it requires non-trivial time and effort. While many honest users have an established online persona and trust relations with other trustworthy users, attackers would find it harder to keep creating new trusted Internet personas (a 5 years old Facebook account is rather scarce and near impossible to obtain on a large scale) and getting vouched from other trusted members.
In addition, consumers can decide to only deal with merchants and agents that have a real-world identity attached to them, giving them legal recourse in case of fraud. This all depends on the market's demands and market forces.
Finally, you seem to be talking mainly about the reputation system, so I answered primarily in regards to that, but the payment system also makes it non-trivial for a single attacker to fraud users. He would have to either collude with one of the other parties to the transaction, or "cheat" the dispute resolution process offered by the trust agent.
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:48:54
Well, basically, every Bitrated identity is represented by a public key (used to sign reviews made by that user, approve contracts, etc). A decentralized system looking to integrate with our reputation information would need to allow users to: a. link their Bitrated account (by providing a digital signature confirming their ownership) and b. send signed reviews to Bitrated's ratings repository.
Reading information out of Bitrated is pretty straightforward - simply send the request with "Accept: application/json" or append ".json" to any URL, and you'll get a JSON response with all the information.
Example:  
We have some [API docs]( available, but not everything has been made public yet. If you want, send me an email at nadav and I'll let you know as soon as more API features roll out.

All voting is skewed towards the "highly active". There's no way around that. We see that all the time in democracy, where a well-organized group can wield more political power than they should have according to their proportion of the population. Here in Israel we see that with the Orthodox Jews, who are able to pass religious laws, get (higher than the rest of the population) government allowance, skip the (otherwise mandatory) army service and boycott corporations into obedience. That is because they have the highest voting rates, are highly active in inner circles of the political parties, and are smart consumers that know how to organize protests and present a unified front to obtain their objectives.


You're confusing "indifference/apathy" with "exit", these are two completely different things. I'm guessing that these who don't care about the blocksize are either consumers that are satisfied with the current fees and user experience Bitcoin has to offer (and would likely be surprised learning about all the drama on reddit about "delays" and "omg full blocks"), or people who simply don't make Bitcoin payments. Either way, I would lean towards counting them towards "retaining the status quo", I see no reason to believe they should be counted as "dissatisfied and switching to a different [crypto]currency". If that was the case and they were indeed dissatisfied with Bitcoin (which they're holding), they would likely become "active voters".

Exchanges don't require participants to have trust relationships among themselves, they all just have to trust the central exchange operator. In this context, I would say that ratings might be less relevant.
I could, however, see them using the historical reputation information to establish the credibility of their users, as part of their internal risk management, and using that to reward honest users with lowered costs and less restrictions.

You could say that in a way. We don't aim to provide product listings, auctions, or anything of this sort. We view ourselves as a base trust layer for reputation management and smart contracts, which applications like marketplaces should build on top of.

While Bitrated is a centralized web-based service, our goal is to make it as trustless as possible by leveraging cryptography and the blockchain technology.
We wrote a little more about that here:
And a relevant HN discussion on that topic: 
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:40:11
We're actually thinking of a model where users could create sub-identities that are not publicly tied to the parent identity, but carry a proof that "this identity owner owns a different identity with a Bitrating of 500 to 700". So you could basically leverage the reputation from your well-known persona under an new pseudonymous identity.

Not quite. BTCrow is a specific service provider (who, btw, offered his services on top of the old Bitrated v1 system), while Bitrated aims to create a platform that lowers the entry barriers and allows an open &amp; competitive market for arbitration services to develop.
There's also the aspect of how the money is kept. Using standard escrow adds a lot of risk (both to the buyer/seller, who may get their funds stolen, and to the escrow agent, who usually operates without the required licensing) and costs to the process, which multi-signature-based smart contracts could alleviate.
Also, may I ask which trustworthy services are you referring to?

We took a conscious decision to prevent users from using shooting themselves in the leg by using weak passwords. History has shown time and again that user-provided passwords are simply not strong enough to withstand brute-force attacks.
You are, of course, free to decide whether you want to use a service that works like that or not.


It should be noted that while the browser does remember the mnemonic, it does not remember the user-provided password, which is required for controlling funds. An attacker gaining access to your saved password would still have to brute-force the user password, which is hardened with Scrypt n=2^16, r=8, p=1.


Did you read to the end of that sentence? While its not clear-cut, I do believe that it could be regarded as a multi-factor system. Under these circumstances, we decided to use a term that's more widely understood by our audience. Our password scheme is quite different from what people are used to as it is, and inventing a new terminology for it would've only made matters worse.
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:11:38
Yes, exactly. We view Bitrated as a platform that sits at the infrastructure layer and provides identity/reputation management, smart contracts and dispute mediation tools to third-party applications (like marketplaces) built on top of it.
[Our APIs]( are not fully ready yet, but are about to get a big update soon.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:56:30


You don't give us any bitcoins. Private keys are held by the parties to transaction and never touch our servers.


You can choose to use the platform to make information about yourself available to others, to help establish your trustworthiness. This is completely opt-in for these that find value in that. We believe that building trust between participants in commerce is something that is indeed valuable, but users are free to make their own choice.
Also, all the ratings, linked accounts and other reputation information you put on Bitrated is completely public and open via APIs. Bitrated is not in a privileged position that gives it access to additional information. And there's no point in selling information that's already public.


While irreversible transactions are definitely valuable in many cases, and it is great to have that as an option, there are many cases where its not desirable. If we want Bitcoin to go mainstream, we must provide consumers with protection against fraud.
Bitrated allows two transacting parties to enter into a contract where a mutually agreed trusted third party can mediate and adjudicate in case of unresolvable disputes. This is very different from the traditional financial system, where the dispute resolution process is tied to a payment processor (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc), giving you little to no choice on who gets to resolve your disputes.
Bitrated creates an open and competitive marketplace for arbitration services that reacts to market demand, and who has to satisfy the requirements of both consumers and merchants (unlike traditional solutions, that lean heavily towards protecting consumers and gives merchants almost no say).
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:35:39
I can understand that. The password scheme we implemented definitely has a security/usability trade-off. We want users to have secure public-key-based digital identities, and it indeed has some usability disadvantages, but this is the choice we made (though, of course, we are trying to provide the best possible experience under the security constraints).
It should perhaps be noted that your browser remembers that password, so you won't have to input it again unless you logout or login from a different machine. (you will, however, be required to input the password you provided any time you want to touch funds)
We elaborated some more on our design goals and choices regarding the password scheme at 


We are aware that this isn't exactly a standard 2FA, but more like a scheme with two factors of the same type ("something you know"). We ended up using that terminology anyway, mostly because this is the closest term that describes this which people are familiar with, but also because you could consider it a 2FA with the mnemonic as the "something you have" (users are not meant to remember it, just keep a copy) and the 2FA password as "something you know".
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:33:33
It should be "hey Where do you see just "hey"?

We're definitely planning to provide an integration API for the payment system, to allow for a seamless experience in 3rd-party marketplaces, e-commerce websites, and more. Our [current public API]( does not expose this functionality yet, but it should be coming pretty soon.

I added this as a suggestion at  If we see enough demand, we'll definitely implement that!
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:53:13
Yeah, the Bitrated v1 release never got much marketing, because the work on v2 has begun shortly after releasing it.
There are actually multiple trust relationships in play - the trust in Bitrated itself as a reliable platform (though, we do our best to [minimize the amount of trust]( users put on us), and the trust in the agent as a reliable arbitrator.
Even if Bitrated becomes an household name, they still need to establish trust in the agent. We do, however, believe that we'll eventually see a few (probably 2-3) big brand names that offer arbitration services and are the go-to choice for standard transactions, with a long-tail market of specialized trust agents who are domain experts in niche markets.
For now, I believe that users would mostly go with agents that have a very well-known and reputable internet/real-wolrld persona outside of Bitrated (i.e. [SamPatt]( from OpenBazaar, [ripple234]( from MasterCoin, or local organizations like the [African Bitcoin Foundation]( or a legal certificate (i.e. [jonklinger]( a well-known Israeli technology attorney and social activist). As the reputation system matures and proves itself, people could start trusting it more and base their decisions on that.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:36:46
Not at the moment, but feel free to add a feature request at 
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:03:09
Multi-signature allows you to distribute the trust you're putting in other people, but there's definitely still need for trust. You need to trust the agent not to conspire with the other party (or even, trust that they aren't the same person), trust the buyer not attempt chargeback-fraud on you, etc. I believe that in many cases, trust and reputation could play a much bigger part than recourse.
We wrote a bit more about that [here](
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:03:14
He doesn't really control the funds, because he can still only finalize transactions that were approved by either the buyer or the seller. Basically, he gets a voting right that allows him to tip the outcome in favor of one of the parties in case they reach an unresolvable disagreement.

I wouldn't make any judgement calls based on speculation, but speculation is still a valuable tool in the search for true. Throwing ideas around might invoke others to come up with better ideas, or to provide more relevant evidence that they wouldn't have thought to be relevant otherwise.
In any case, this is, of course, your decision to make. It's just that him being involved with the blocksize debate and personal attacks against reputable members of the community does not seem to fit with him being a simple conman working for his own personal gain.

We thought long and hard about that, and picked the best available option. The password scheme we use is quite unique and don't really have any fitting terminology, so we preferred going with something that's more widely understood by our audience.
Until about two weeks ago, Bitrated used an alternative terminology based on terms that we picked, but user testing has shown this to be extremely confusing. When we switched to "2FA", it was much more intuitive for users to understand what's going on.
The way the authentication system works already introduces some learning curve as-is, and inventing a new terminology that people can't relate to would've only made matters worse.

Core did provide a doubling of the blocksize, which could be rolled out safely and quickly as a softfork. After we get this doubling, we can start collecting more data and think about the next bump. Why delay SegWit until the time a HF is ready, when SegWit can be activated in mere weeks?


Nearly every participant in the ecosystem has indicated support for SegWit, and many of them (75 companies) already have it implemented. Once the big transaction producers (exchanges, hosted wallets, etc) switch over to SegWit, we'll see an immediate fee pressure relieve.

You can use 2-of-3 with those three keys:
- A private key that's stored on the computer (with backup on a paper wallet)
- A private key that's stored on a third-party service
- A private key that's stored *only* as a paper wallet (and generated/used on an offline machine), or even a brain wallet with a strong password (~10-15 words with some typos and weird punctuation/spacing should be fine)
That way, for day-to-day transactions you use the one on the computer + the one on the third party, and have the paper-wallet-only private key for backup.

Licensing fees are usually not charged as some percentage of the revenue one stands to make from using the patent... this means that licensing would only be profitable for mining operations large enough so that a 20% boost would cover the licensing costs.
And even if it was profitable to everyone, patents and licensing requirements adds all sorts of friction to the process. Not everyone would be able or willing to go into a licensing agreement, and the patent holder would likely not be willing to sell to everyone. There are also additional costs in the form of lawyer fees, potential disputes and court enforcement costs. Also, the miner wouldn't be able to mine anonymously anymore if he wanted that license.

The main use-case for the payment system is to enable safe commerce between two parties that don't trust each other. For example, if you were buying some alpaca socks online, but didn't trust to the seller to deliver them as promised, the payment system would allow you to involve a trusted third party that mediates disputes and can have the final say in case of unresolvable disagreements.
The reputation system, while also very useful in the context of e-commerce, has a more broader scope - for example, it could be useful to vet new open-source contributors that wish to receive commit access, or to show who stands behind a new crypto project that wants to crowdfund, and how trustworthy are they.

This is actually a good idea. You could even go as far as trying to bribe them as one of the parties...
Perhaps this is even something that Bitrated could do itself in the future.

Hey, I'm one of the founders at Bitrated. I'd love to hear any feedback/questions/suggestions you have.
If you don't know what multisig/m-of-n means, check out the FAQ: 
If you want to play with it, there's also a testnet [1] version: 
When it asks you to share the URL with the other party, you can just open that in a new tab.
If you don't want to go through all the process, you can see how the transaction page looks [here](
[1]  you can get some testnet coins sent to the multisig from a faucet:

In any case, the users should keep their own safe copies of all the keys, signature and terms. This allows them to release the funds even if Bitrated becomes unavailable.
The browser's local storage isn't a reliable place to store such sensitive information, so I would have to give them some string/file to keep a copy of in addition to that anyway. I think that just using the URL as that string makes sense, being able to use a bookmark is a nice addition (even if one that I find non-optimal - ideally, it should be kept encrypted, but  I know that most users won't do that and just end up keeping it in some file on their desktop, which is just as secure as using a bookmark)
When I implement encrypted server storage for the transaction information, it might make sense to allow accessing it by logging-in to the website, but users should still keep their own copies of everything.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:44:53
Thanks! The security and privacy aspects played a big role in designing the architecture of Bitrated.

I've been working on something exactly like that, also based on QR codes and with a deterministic wallet. I'm expecting to release it in a week or two, if I'll manage to find enough time to finish it.
Edit: here's a screenshot: 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:57:36
Yeah, I had a few people sign up that looks serious, but this really needs an active community in order to succeed.
I was also surprised it didn't get much attention, but Reddit submissions have an element of luck and timing to it. Perhaps I'll try submitting it again tomorrow and see how that goes.

The miners will follow the market and mine the profitable chain. The markets will determine the outcome here, the initial hashrate distribution is nearly meaningless (as we saw with ETC, that initially had 0.3%).

@_date: 2013-12-09 22:35:47
Its going to be challenging fitting that into a QR code, as it also contains the transaction terms (they must keep a copy of them to show the arbitrator in case of dispute). And if the transaction terms would be saved separately, then we're back to saving a file somewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:15:39
It should be quite simple (I hope!), but it seems like someone took is already. I'm waiting for the second one to confirm, I'll publish the link in a moment
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:48:49
The URL could still get sent, but not by Chrome sending it to Google servers. The user would have the post it somewhere else that is accessible to search engine crawlers.
And yes, an encrypted URL with a passphrase is something that we plan to add in a future release.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:38:51
Thanks, but the credit for that should mostly go to [Bootstrap]( and [Bootswatch]( :)

Its not in the blockchain. Its in blockchain**.info**'s database and possibly in some other nodes mempool.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:02:57
I want to keep it simple and arbitration-specific, so I probably won't be adding completely other types of contracts (not with that website, anyway, but I do have some plans for other bitcoin-contracts-related projects).
And time locked transactions are possible with [nLockTime]( and a low [sequence number]( which might be a cool addition in the future. The parties would sign the reversed transaction in the beginning, locked to some point in the future. If it won't be replaced by another transaction, they could announce it and reverse it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:51:21
Seems so! What browser are you using?
Reply to edit: I can't seem to reproduce it here with Firefox. I'm using some external APIs to handle communication with the Bitcoin network (blockchain.info and coinb.in), and I think they probably were temporarily unavailable for some reason. I'll look into it, thanks for reporting it!
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:46:31


Originally, I did call it an "escrow" service, by had to change that due to a legal advice from my lawyer (it has a specific meaning in the law and invokes all kinds of regulations, liabilities and licensing requirements, but most importantly, with the way it works - its really not an escrow).
And yes, I agree - it could definitely use some better texts that appeal to a broader audience and use a little bit less technical terms, but I'm more of a programmer and its not really my strong suit :) I'll try and see what I can do about that.


This would require 1) a system for sending messages via the website that could detect when one party isn't responsive and 2) allowing that system to sign transactions releasing the money.
This means that the system would have to be trusted with the power to sign transactions, in addition to the arbitrator. I'm not sure that's a role I want to take, or if that's a role that users would trust the service with.
For now, that role can be given to the arbitrator itself, who could declare that he's releasing the money to one party if the other party isn't responsive for X time (which I also mention [here]( possibly for a discounted fee.
Edit: and thanks for the tip :)

I wonder why they would do that. Loading data over ajax (and not with jsonp) isn't something that I think should be blocked by NoScript. Only execution of remote scripts.
As to loading a script from coinb.in - this would theoretically allow them to load a malicious script that sends a copy of the private keys to some server. I am purposely [not loading *any* scripts]( at all from remote servers, everything is served from bitrated.com.

Its currently limited to 3, but it will probably be raised in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:46:34
Its not sent over GET - the part of the URL after the " isn't sent to the server during http requests. Its only accessed from javascript, and allows me to get everything I need client-side from the URL alone without storing anything on the server.
There's basically no record of the transaction at all; it only exists when opening that specific URL.
@_date: 2013-06-28 04:49:40
Thanks :) Do you mind giving the exact percentage for IE8 only?

Satoshi Nakamoto, the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( (emphasis mine)
All transactions being reversible, regardless of the buyer/seller wishes, is definitely bad. Allowing two parties who transact together the option to choose an arbitrator they both trust to arbitrate possible disputes is exactly the kind of thing that should be done on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:12:29
Two parties can sign together whatever transaction they want. They can sign a partial refund transaction, or even a transaction that sends coins to some 4th party. It doesn't matter.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:18:37
Heh, this is actually the fifth or sixth time Bitrated was submitted here since I released it (about a week ago), and none of the submission made it to the frontpage until this one, so your analysis was somewhat correct.
I'm glad to see this one is doing better :)
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:15:24
Its arbitration (dispute resolution service), not arbitrage.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:44:48
Really? I was wondering about the downvotes too, and didn't know the up/down numbers weren't accurate. Why does Reddit do that?
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:03:44
Great questions!
1. No. The website doesn't have access to any of the private keys, and cannot do anything in case one of the parties is unresponsive. The only thing that can be done against that is use reliable, trustworthy and reputable arbitrator. Perhaps it should also be noted that if Bob and Alice are in agreement, they don't need the arbitrator in order to move funds. Even if they don't agree to release the money to one of them, they could agree sending it to a new multi-sig address with another arbitrator.
2. Currently, Bitrated is still in an MVP-y stage and doesn't handle any of the communications between the parties at all, its expected to go over other means of communication. We do plan to implement something that allows users to communicate directly on Bitrated, and when we do, it'll be encrypted end-to-end and digitally signed.

This is actually something that I really want to have, but its somewhat problematic to record it myself (I'm not a native English speaker and have some strong Israeli accent :).

They can always add more decimal places, and make the total number of units as large as they want.

Oh wow, thanks, that's very generous :)
And yes, I've been wondering myself how come no one created an interface for multisig transactions yet. Its been part of the protocol for so long, just waiting for someone to take up the glove...
Edit: As for the question (I didn't see that before, did you edit your comment or I was just being blind?), yes, I am planning a rating/reputation system for the future. Its still very much MVP-y right now.

How would their wallet password be stolen by hacking into Target servers? The attackers would have to compromise 30 million separate computers of the consumers (or the web wallets they used to store their private keys).
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:10:33
We are aware of the problems with client-side cryptography and the possibility of forging the javascript served from our servers, and we [plan on taking some steps]( to make this less of a threat (specifically, see the section about the work-in-progress browser extension), given the limitations of the web platform.
As for XSS - since you aren't persistently authenticated to the service at all (using cookies or something like that) and all the data exists only in the URL, most XSS vulnerabilities would be quite useless for an attacker. A non-persistent XSS wouldn't have access to anything sensitive - it has to be a persistent XSS that's executed inside the page with the sensitive information, which is just a plain HTML file served directly from nginx that communicates with a websocket server and some APIs.

I try to have my websites gracefully degrade, but that's not always (easily) possible. In that case, some of the core functionality heavily relies on some newer features (like canvas, webgl and web workers) that I could get try to get working using alternative methods (iframes instead of webworkers, canvas shims, and gracefully degrade webgl) on older browsers, but I think that it might be a waste of time when targeting Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:24:52
I think this is a great idea. In fact, I was hoping the community would come up with some standard terms templates for buyers/sellers, and even for arbitrators. This could really help - expecting everyone to write their own terms from scratch and make them clear, easy for the arbitrator to judge upon and cover the corner cases is non-trivial at all.
(I'm the creator of Bitrated)
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:33:15
Nope, never made it to the front :) I'm planning to do a repost on Monday morning with a cool idea for promotion I had, hopefully it'll go better this time.
The arbitrator database does have an API - just add ".json"/".txt" to the profile URLs (its linked in the bottom) or ".json" to the listing URLs. Examples:
- 
- 
- 
- 
Instead of the extension, its also possible to send a request to the regular URL with the appropriate "Accept" header.
Perhaps I should make those links a little more visible, it seems like no one noticed its there.
And there are also some other things that I'm planning to add an API for, to allow easier integration with ecommerce websites.

There are two major problems with IE that prevents it from being supported: Until IE11, it lacks a CSPRNG (random number generator, which is needed for securely creating private keys) and it limits the URL length to 2,083 characters (the hash portion of the URL is used to store all the transaction data, as a way to avoid saving it on the server, and makes it easier to save all the needed information as a single URL).
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:32:50
Its only been out for about 4 days. Its been alpha-tested quite extensively before the public release, but I don't want to take any risks with people's money before I'm 110% sure it works well and is bug-free (I'm the developer behind Bitrated).
Edit: there's also a testnet version at  if anyone wants to give it a try without risking any money.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:24:50
I'm glad to see you're also excited about this project! :)
Referring cases to a panel of arbitrators and allowing appeals is an interesting idea that could possibly even be codified using the Bitcoin scripting language in the future, but those kinds of transactions aren't yet standard. In the meanwhile it could still be handled by trustworthy arbitrators who promise to abide by such panels / appeal processes.
As to a forum - I actually created an r/Bitrated subreddit, but its not very active as I haven't told anyone it exists yet. I'm planning to try and get some people to join in the next few days.

Using random/unreadable strings for the auth token is very problematic. Its very easy to fool users into signing an authentication that they don't intend to. As an attacker, I could go to "somebank.com", retrieve the random string from the bank, and display that same token to users that attempt to login to another site that I control. When they provide the signature, I can use it to login to somebank.
A better alternative is adding some readable text to the string that's being signed, like: "I wish to login to somebank.com, with the token: ko9GtMz8T2ka9u75A".

We don't do the arbitration services ourselves, its a platform for others to offer those services.
If you want to be an arbitrator, you can open an account and charge fees from your customers.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:32:23
It really depends on the arbitrator, but here are a few things he could do:
- Ask the seller to provide a delivery tracking number and verify it with the delivery company
- Ask the seller to prove he had the product, be e.g. providing a recipet from his supplier
- Check with previous customers who bought from that seller, or previous sellers who sold to the buyer
- Try to talk with both parties and try to evaluate their reliability and try to find incompatibilities in their stories

Its easier to save a copy of everything in the URL; it makes it robust and easy to backup (you can bookmark it or copy it and save it somewhere as a string), and its not effected by clearing the browser or switching computers.
There's one thing that I'm thinking of doing to make short URLs - [encrypted server storage]( as an optional opt-in. When I add that, I could theoretically support IE11 users who opt-in to the short urls.

Those URLs are meant for Bob and Alice to save privately, and shouldn't be shared with other people. The URL contains all the information they need in order to release the funds.
I was just sharing those to allow people to access the interface as Bob and Alice would, it shouldn't usually be published publicly.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:59:18
Hey, I see you opened an account to write this comment - thanks!
The buyer/seller interfaces being symmetric made it easier to develop, but we might need to consider changing that in the future, though I do kinda like that they're like that.
As to both parties having to be logged-in in the same time - this is somewhat problematic, but it allows us to avoid saving the transaction permanently on our servers, which we prefer not to do. In the future, we plan to [keep an encrypted copy of transaction request]( on the server, which would let us implement this in a secure way and allow the parties to connect separately.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:04:34
