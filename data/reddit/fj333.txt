Why read the article when you can speculate about what it might say?

So you're not worried to lose what you've invested (i.e. a net negative), but you'd be terrified to lose a hypothetical previous gain (i.e. a net break-even)? That doesn't make any kind of sense.

Bubbles transcend the object being bought and sold. Just because the *thing* being traded around is new, does not mean that economic fundamentals don't precede the market. Bubbles are about people; like the rest of economics, they are a social phenomenon.

Rich != wealthy. A distinction rarely understood by recipients of a gambling windfall.

The number one function of a market is to support buying and selling. Blaming a broken market on its participants is ludicrous.

Economics is an entirely social force. Supply and demand are both functions of what humans *feel*.
The problem with the cult rhetoric thrown around on here, is that those spewing it seem to believe that their words on here (and choices with their own holdings) carry enough weight to influence an entire market (i.e. change the minds and actions of a significant amount of people in that market). In short, they believe that if they hold, and urge others to do the same, they're doing their part to stave off any impending dips. This is cute, and silly, but ultimately wasted breath. The market will do what it's going to do, no matter how hard you "hodl" or how many memes you make on an internet forum.

Bingo. Question is very flawed.

It's still an interesting cultural phenomenon. Even if you're not a member of the prevalent cult here, there are still plenty of compelling discussions to be had about BTC.

Nothing to do with JavaScript, everything to do with floating point arithmetic.
And 10^N == 1eN by definition. No need to calculate anything.
But all of that is beside the point. My issue was with *precision*, not *accuracy*. 1.00000.... would have been just as ridiculous as 1.0000....1.

You might want to learn about significant figures. Seventeen sig figs is ridiculously silly under any circumstances, particularly so when the quantity being discussed is an extremely rough estimate.
