@_date: 2017-12-12 03:45:25
I agree, if fees are too high and confirms are slow shouldn't the devs fix it? my xlm costs me  .001 to send crypto in five seconds, my btc costs ten dollars to send in hopefully ten minutes to an hour, even my ltc moves faster and cheaper. Is there any plan to fix this? 
I only use crypto to make day to day purchases, the fees are curently unsustainable if it wasn't for the profit that makes it a better store of value then a bank. Most of you here don't even use crypto on a dsily basis to buy things so you wouldn't know the current speed bumps we face with efficiency.

Wait till it hits 50k and 100k. Lots of future millionaires cashing out then. Will it crash btc, that remains to be seen. Truth is people are all invested at different price points, dips will happen and as the price raises the dips will get bigger.

@_date: 2018-09-01 20:21:38
Satoshi supported bip70, ltc, bch, abc, etc... You know how I know this for a fact? He created bitcoin with the ability for the people to choose its direction and fork it. He supported all forms of progress and trusted that the majority would find a consensus eventually. He left his own opinion out of it. Something so few in this space can do, be impartial.
You say bitpay is cancer, but I would rather use the bch address decoder to make a quick tx and use my crypto in a tight spot rather than wait days for an ach transfer. I use and support bch every time I use crypto which is very often. I will soon move to a stellar xlm to usd card for the efficiency reasons. We owe all of this progress to btc. 
Now as far as me being called insecure because I admitted to being an early adopter, well my point was that I have made a decent amount off of being an early adopter in a space that was joke to most normies until the last bull run. You can associate me with ver, that is fine, I really don't mind what you think of me. Just take a minute and think about your pointless waste of negative energy. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:02:02
You should be ashamed for thinking it's ready for mass adoption. Atleast bitpay enables early adopters like myself the ability to use our crypto in an almost instant manner to buy goods till the tech and apps catch up with adoption. Easy use is the bottleneck. 
I will support any company that makes using crypto more accessible and efficient without bias to what coins I hold.... Why? Because that is how you truly support a technology. All of you are just concerned with supporting your wallets, and that is fine, but don't try to act noble when you causes are geared towards self enrichment. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:33:58
I support Bitcoin for the record, and I support crypto as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:14:31
Use bitpay every day... No problem. Crypto isn't for the technically challenged. That said, I wouldn't want to be responsible for getting anyone into crypto. Five+ yrs ago yes, now I don't want that responsibility at these prices. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:26:49
I will agree that it is wack and a pain. But I see no other current alternative. And I would think any real bch supporters wouldn't let this deter them. But to each their own. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:33:14
Ah crap, sorry. I really do try not to take sides. If bitcoin scales I'll use it daily for purchases but for now its my store of value coin. I will agree though that ver and csw are douchey and likely not satoshi based purely on the temperament and humbleness it would take to remain anon.... He wouldn't go through all that trouble just to come forward later and ask for attention.

Hal has the money to fund this research from the grave. He knew he would so he had himself cryogenically frozen and a unbeknownst team headed by the boggs will start the research after btc hits 100k. The keys were entrusted to a program he wrote, on a deads mans switch that triggers a very specific plan that will unfold off the blockchain and later be brought on. It is running on a separate chain he created with smart contracts and he already solved oracle problem. You will all bow to your reborn overlord satoshi when he is brought back to life in a robotic body as the richest man ever... At which point he will get in elon musks tesla space shuttle car and fly away to live on his own planet. The Winkelvoss twins are the first timeline of the Bogdonoffs, they invented time travel to ensure Satoshis plan, and under went surgery after a failed time jump left them stranded waiting to fix their timeline. After the singularity hits when time travel is once again created, they will both disappear into thin air and the timeline will be sealed.

Good luck. It is a tough situation indeed. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:16:43
A very expensive coffee indeed.
Still a ways to go before mass adoption due to common sense. Situations like this can strike fear into the mainstream public out of lack of knowledge. 
The idea behind being your own bank also entails being your own security, this is not stressed enough to newcomers. Remember the private key that was shown on tv and btc community took it before it could get actually thieved. Those days are slowly being numbered and awareness is key moving forward.

It was fairly early in the btc adoption phase so I would assume it was something introduced or initiated by somone in their IT dept. It was on a moderated trial run at the time from what I remember of the call. It was a lady asking me about the transaction. It's my experience most people seem to have questions anytime I bring any crypto currency up; so the call isn't so weird now that I think about it.

You are confusing burnt or locked as in lost key with theft. And yes when keys are lost they are essentially taken out of the supply.

However if they are stolen, they remain in circulation, just not in the owners hands, they end up in the thiefs... This is why being your own bank entails being your own security.

Anything costing around pennies is the same as free to most consumers. Only ones that will care are large corporations that worry about bottom lines and constantly saving money...
With that said, as long as it is instant, cheap and secure from first to third layer it sounds promising.
I am huge Stellar supporter, and it already has these option with less work. The mining and decentralization is what makes bitcoin special, that I understand. Lets see where this goes... The market needs btc to succeed to avoid losing momentum. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:35:21
It works a lot better with bch I've found. I still have to use a converter for the address though. 
I've used it every day for the last few years and btc takes too long with confirmations for the funds to reconfirm what is left in my wallet after a purchase. So I keep my btc in cold storage and use my bch for spending money. 
Just advice from a seasoned bitpay pro not pro either coin, I use them both.

That's some first world shit right here. The fees are still redic and so are block times and we are rivaling other countries currencies with a digital asset we don't want to spend because it's more valuable to hold then use. We need real world use and more efficient safe wallets with integrated exchanges or people will lose interest fast. We are gaining adoption but we are not ready for it, sounds like a plan for failure.

Diversify, I have been in since 2012 and am headed into med school myself. I work two jobs just to invest in crypto on top of school full time. This is the future, so anything you put in will be the best chance at an investment return as you can get by savings standards. Now can you risk to lose that amount is the question? Never compromise your lifestyle for the investment unless its choosing a few coins over a video game or other luxuries. 
Find a few alts you truly believe in and invest. I choose btc,bcc,eth,ltc,xmr,xlm as my portfolio. I believe each one has a use case in the future of crypto. You need to have faith in what you choose so you can buy it, then stick it in a ledger hardware and forget about it a few years. Keep a little on an exchange if you need a bit to play with, but keep the majority on hardware. 
Last and most important, have an exit strategy.. Just in case. 
No you are not too late. If you truly believe crypto is the future of currency then too late is the day after mass adoption when the dollar falls in price because of the exodus to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:52:01
It's called KYC. Pretty routine..they would be operating illegally if they handled cash any other way. Had you just used it to send crypto to wallets or as an exchange you would be fine. Just convert to btc and send to your coinbase verified account.

Yup, btc has run its course. It is only time till it's either replaced completely or ltc is seated at its rightful place as btcs counterpart.

I spent bitcoin today as I usually use bch for daily use... it is such a nightmare using it in a time sensitive situation. As a regular crypto user I wish everything moved as efficiently as stellar does. It just works. Bitcoin is why I even got into crypto in 2011 but now it is just a nuisance and holding back the whole space. Credit were credit is due, but it's time to step aside and allow a new face of crypto that will help with adoption. And no not bch, a crypto with no drama and actual infrastructure. 
Yes yes I know, decentralization is the goal, I agree, but we need to find a happy medium so both can exist and work fluidly without a wait.

I've done extensive research into this dip and the current market.

Btc's gravitational pull has become so strong that the moon is now coming to us. Ofcourse this has had an adverse effect of panic and sell offs due to global destruction and fud...hey atleast we got one thing right...

Crypto was never intended to completely replace fiat, it was meant to supplement the world economy and help solve the world's monetary downfalls. It's meant to give people another option, banks and fiat will always exist, crypto will just be used as a tool to facilitate both worlds faster and cheaper and more secure. People will always need loans or want loans, "crypto gives the people back the choice of control", which was taken away at one point. Now people have a choice, let the banks control their money, or do it themselves.  
It is in no ones interest to completely replace fiat, governments would collapse, depressions would devistate the lower and middle classes across the globe leading to power struggles and world wars.... a redistribution of wealth via crypto is happening but it won't be as severe if we integrate crypto instead of replace fiat. The Fed Reserve in its own sick way serves a purpose of balance, now we can use blockchain tech to better monitor and control greed and manipulation in a trustless public ledger.

Currently bitcoin is still a speculative investment in the mass public eye. Yes "we" believe in it and understand the real benefits but the public doesn't really get the scam of the federal reserve... We need to focus more on that. 
How long new comers hold vs. How quick old hodlers sell for profit vs. The fresh batch of new buyers will determine when it crashes and scares the weak hands away. Lately we are seeing posts of more and more original hodlers cashing out and claiming crypto millionaire status. This will bring an inevitable bubble burst and then everyone who really believes will buy more while weak hands run. The market will continue to grow but wont stabilize till it is no longer looked at as a way to make money, but actually a secure stable form of money itself.

Do you understand the federal reserve, national debt and the currency exchange? Not many people do, why? Because it is a giant mindfuck of laws, rules, exceptions and excuses for why money is worth what its worth. Wouldn't you like to know exactly what your money is worth without having to worry about the national debt or political manipulation? 
The blockchain ledger offers that kind of transparency. You can't print more bitcoins like the federal reserve does dollars. Inflation/deflation, all tools used to manipulate every human being in the world and opress weaker economies and nations. We are not americans, africans, germans or tunisians, we are all humans; and we deserve a standard human currency devoid of goverment manipulation. 
Bitcoin isnt about sticking it to the man.... It's about stopping the man from sticking it to everyone else.

The only way to realistically figure this out is to do the math. The market capped out at btc 21M and then broken down into decimal points or satoshis as mooners call it, but more likely called bits. Calculate the total average daily bank transactions over a 1-10yrs and at that point figure out the percentage the market would move with day to day transactions at full volume. If the swing is miniscule enough at that projected volume to the point of fractions of a cent then it is a feasible currency.... If not then it's bust. 
Anyone care to do the math.... Because I don't.

Blockchain would have prevented all of this. And bernie would have won.

That's cute. You think making assumptions and bringing up research will deter a true blockchain enthusiast. You should do some research before assuming that bitcoin and blockchain are only useful for one purpose:
Want a true democratic election with proof of work, a public ledger, and no chance of voter manipulation... Blockchain. 
Want a true corporate board controling the direction of a company with smart contracts and proof of work without voter manipulation... Blockchain. 
Want a secure safe internet experience completely revolutionizing the internet to internet 2.0.... Blockchain technology. 
So ya loans, store of value, anything a bank is good for can be completely replaced by non human technology. We don't need humans with their greedy interests in mind "helping" us with our money. And well that's the future. 
Want to hear a good joke I over heard today:
Two dollars walk into the federal reserve.... Ten trillion walk out unaccounted for.

Well gov could make banks temp ban currency exchanges with crypto exchanges till they can find a way to profit off of it. This will force a mass sell off and ensure a big buy in. It's all in the timing. We have yet to see a massive opposition besides the 2013 china bans, sr, and mtgox.

I can agree that any crypto deserves a trial by fire and this isn't the first or last boss to battle.

This sub gives a bad impression of the real btc community. The one i was part of in 2013... I came back to see whats going on after hodling and forgeting and i see with its rise its also lost its friendly, informative, community nature that made it so great to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:40:21
I don't wish for this but china has a number of exchanges closing by sept 30 and friday is a big sell day in general. Mon-tues will bounce back. None of this will effect btc or crypto much at all in the long run but temporarily it will cause panic. Same as 2012-13
Also lots of traders are lowering there buy prices now since the dip. This will take the floor out for friday.

Fiat is backed by armies and nukes. Don't kid yourself... Crypto is the future, but fiat will likely always be around.

Agreed, the bitcoin logo sealed the deal for me... I wouldn't hide my cash in a box marked money. 
Still nice work, just needs to be rethought. Anything with a hidden compartment would be a strong selling point. Especially if said compartment was fire proof.

It all makes sense now. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:47:14
You are assuming every bill printed is actually accounted for. When in reality there is nothing stopping any gov from printing unaccounted for fiat like a counterfeiter would and then later destroying it when it returns to the bank leaving no trace. 
This reason is why we need accountability on a public blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:28:56
Ok, tell me this. Let's say that happens.... And then the government prints more money and buys crypto with it? When does it stop? At some point exchanges have to stop accepting fiat to stop fiat or all any gov has to do is keep printing more paper bills.

Nope, bad i investments. I met a guy a year ago that was investing in crypto atms. They are missing the idea completely.... It's expensive advertising at their expense. Doubt they will ever turn a real profit after each newb would only buy there once then do it cheaper at home without waving a flag in public saying I own crypto.
