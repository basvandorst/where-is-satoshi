Lol fair, I definitely recommend storing on a wallet you control.
Thanks for the link.

Which apps? Robinhood is one of the more accessible stock apps and it doesn't allow fractional shares.
Fees vary. Bitcoin transactions were much cheaper a year ago, and even today it can be cheap to buy and leave on the exchange (assuming you trust it).

1 share of Microsoft costs $85, no fractions.
1 uBTC costs $0.02

Fees were cheap then. I wonder what they're using these days.

I know this is a super old thread but I can't resist being pedantic.
I'd argue that the gold itself is perfectly fungible (aka "melt value") whereas the _numismatic_ value of various coins is not.
Gold is just atomic number 79, and there's nothing distinguishing about particular atoms.

Gosh it's hard to post external links on this subreddit.
I found this to be a good essay. Will obfuscating the link get it past the çėñșóřş? Sorry about the funky letters.

Instead of trying to choose the best day to cash out, I probably would have "averaged out" as ETH became &gt;90% of my net worth. As it keeps growing, keep trimming back.

Credit can be withdrawn. Debt can be defaulted on. Fiat money can be printed. Those kinds of assets are all someone else's liability. If the counterparty goes under, you don't have assets anymore.
Commodities are nobody's liability. The USD price might fluctuate, but at the end of the day you still have "stuff".
Commodities like wheat and oranges have a high storage cost and degrade over time, so they aren't a great store of value. In contrast, gold, oil, and bitcoin are all excellent stores of value. Nobody runs Bitcoin, just as nobody runs gold or wheat. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and is easier to trade.

Out of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has the biggest network effects.

Maybe email the exchange to arrange an over-the-counter exchange, rather than placing a surprise market sell.

The USD is the world reserve currency; other currencies are backed by USD. Central banks around the world keep sizeable USD reserves.

Remember that many of the coins were lost. That's why MtGox went bankrupt. It's only at these high prices that MtGox became solvent.

Prof. Robert Shiller has a good lecture about central banks on YouTube.

Gold's use as currency has dropped off quite a bit, although you probably could find someone who would accept gold as payment for pizza. USA Gold Eagle coins have a $50 legal tender value, although the gold content is worth a lot more than that. Remember the gold standard was only suspended in 1971, not even fifty years ago.
Your second question is where my answers have to become a lot more opinionated. Crypto is still in the adoption phase so it's hard to say exactly. Here are some of the reasons that lead me towards bitcoin opposed to other coins:
1. It's the oldest. This blockchain has survived nearly a decade of nonstop attacks. We've identified and fixed subtle bugs like the transaction malleability attack. Bitcoin is a long-term survivor.
2. Nobody runs Bitcoin. Unlike all these other coins which are being run like a business, Bitcoin just _is._ There is no CEO, no bureaucracy. Just a web of participating nodes.
3. It's scarcer than gold. The aboveground supply of gold has more than doubled since the 1970s. Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million. Some cryptos are targeting low inflation rates, but the fixed supply of Bitcoin makes it appealing to hold.
4. As the most popular coin, Bitcoin enjoys the biggest network effects and a lion's share of developer attention.
5. Now that the hype has died down, transactions are cheap again (less than $1). Lightning Network is starting to be deployed and offers a path to scalability so that transactions can remain cheap.
The real answer to "Why bitcoin over anything else?" is "What else would you pick?" Litecoin is just copy+paste. Ethereum is cool but the dev team has a lot of power (remember they undid the DAO hack). I like what they're doing but a decentralized coin seems safer. Monero is neat but I don't envision it overtaking bitcoin.

The cost of food and other items depends on the currency.
Your house can appreciate in USD at the same time it's depreciating in BTC.

Oil, gold, and bitcoin are all priced in USD, so what? I didn't say any of these things are investments, I said they are commodities and assets. They pay no dividends and the USD price fluctuates.
Oil, gold, and bitcoin are all good stores of value, although it's hard for individuals to store oil. Bitcoin is the easiest to store.
Gold has been currency and commodity for millenia, I don't see why bitcoin can't also be both.
