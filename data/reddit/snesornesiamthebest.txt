It could also be set up to require a trx be made and confirmed every time someone wants to log onto the PC.  That would create a public log of sorts of how many people have accessed that PC and when.  A company could use this by giving each employee a bitcoin address to use so individual user logins can be tracked via the blockchain.  Sure you could just log it all in house, but then you have to trust people in charge of the logs to never lie or cheat.  Hardware crashes on occasion too.  Even if this idea is stupid it shows the different uses the blockchain is capable of and thats what excites me about all this!

I think it's bigger than just a DDOS.  Their btc buy price spiked to almost $10,000 before it went offline.  Probably hacked but I don't know anything for sure.

It is directly related due to the fact that bitcoins will never be suspended in Crimea, or anywhere else.  It is highlighting a major feature of the cryptocurrency.

If you go around playing with something you don't understand then you are correct.  Sending your BTC to the correct address isn't exactly rocket science though.

What authority does the US government have over a Japanese exchange?  I still don't understand this.

What kind of parent indoctrinates their 10 year old to the point that they would even write something like this for a school assignment?

He's been talking up SecondMarket and Wall Street getting into bitcoin since the beginning of the year.  I don't listen to anything he says anymore.

This would be for systems that require a little more security than your moms candy crush machine and it was literally an idea that just popped into my head.  I have not thought about the details for more than about 10 mins.  I was just trying to run an idea across some other possibly like minded individuals and who knows maybe it will give someone else an idea that could end up being very useful.
This is more about finding other uses for the blockchain that don't directly involve finances.  I would think that Trx's would make pretty good timestamps that are immune to tampering or hardware malfunction.

Starting next paycheck my 401k money will be used to buy bitcoin.  I'm going to do this for a year and then go back to the 401k.  Hoping its the right choice!

So what stops people from buying with CC and then do a chargeback?

Since when do miners coordinate with each other over multiple exchanges to sell their coins at the exact same time?  I don't know what is doing it but the miners aren't.

All you need is the internet to use bitcoin.  And I'm pretty sure they have that, even if it is just shitty cell phone service.

I'm not a bitcoin troll and I agree with him.  This commercial made me cringe.  The other ones were good though.

I am willing to bet that belief came from the parents.   A 10 year old has no grasp on the real world potential impact of something like bitcoin unless their parents are preaching to them about it constantly.
