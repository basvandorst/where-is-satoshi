Ah, the "interviewer".

I don't know, I don't want to debate on Garza but I honestly don't think he ripped people off any more than other cloud mining services, it's fine that you say he did as your entitled to your opinion and I'm not here to argue with anyone tho.

As a reddit user and frequent visitor of this sub, I don't agree with most of the statements made here, it saddens me to see this sub stoop to the level it is currently at, and I just wanted to let you know that. I believe all this hatred combined with subjective titles (like the one of this thread) is completely rediculous and is burning bridges that don't need to be burned on top of that the constant call to boycots is just so detrimental to the overall industry that it's turning me away from crypto all together.
That being said, lately I can't make a post that doesn't get downvoted out of sight in seconds here myself. 
I just wanted to say it's not because it appears one sided that no one is on your side of the fence, especially so on reddit.

Really scary what bitmain is doing with their cloud hashing solutions imo. 
Umisoo pool that are already 70% fees and you agreed to forfeit the entire investment you made if it ever peaks at 100%. (from their TOS)
Only S3s are available for purchase as cloud hosted, S4 and S5 are not being made available as a cloud option, I guess they first need to jack up btc difficulty more and use them more themselves before actually sharing with customers. 
Now on the S5s that I could get, at least it's the industry norm, but the S4s... come on...

I still don't get why people are more angry about the xpy CEO speaking than Ver and Shrem who have both been convicted.
(Serious inquiry, I don't get it, perhaps I don't follow the whose who of bitcoin enough to know)
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:17:42
That I can get.

The way I see it the premine was to gather coins for the investors &amp; cloud mining customers trough ICO because of it being a POS coin I don't see much wrong with that or questionable. GoCoin ceo confirmed they will list xpy "soon" on twitter, and features are supposedly in development and due end of january. 
a POS coin is very different from bitcoin imo, LTC would fit your description far more accurately. 
*disclaimer* I do have a little invested in almost all cloud mining services, including GAW, and I really don't want to argue in favor of them, I also wouldn't advice buying into paycoin to others right now given the controversy, but I wanted to answer your response honestly and if we look at cloud mining well about 80% of the things I invested in went bust and stopped paying, gaw is not among them (yet?).

You're right, should've read slower.

To be fair, the charity part left out that they actually refunded all the money raised in order NOT to be considered subjective. 
Threads like this are LITERALLY reversing charitable actions. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:17:06
So basically Shrem and Ver are more charismatic to the subset of people that visit but that implies bias, so how just are all these boycot actions than? 
Idk I agree with alot of libertarian beliefs, but I still don't think it makes sense that the non convicted guy is the controversial one. Oh well can't blame people for appreciating a friendly face. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:12:43
I'm sorry but how is this serious and or objective journalism with a title like that? 
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:17:31
You have to question it, however there is no place where can  you can get an answer without getting downvoted out of sight or boycotted to all damnation, so why even question it then? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:02:01
Were you really surprised? After all the accusing that's going on here lately lol.

"Able to reword others their articles without doing any real journalistic research".
Not trying to rip on bravenewcoin.com but that's how I feel that description is met in 90% of bitcoin news outlets.
