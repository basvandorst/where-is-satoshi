OP You need to make your own post on bitcointalk, not just post in a thread about it.

I love this idea and think it's great. I'd be interesting in helping as well if / where I can. I'm a .net / android developer and work in payment systems.

Can you please post something (server logs, whited out if necessary) to verify that you're actually getting DDOS'd? Thanks.

Not to be rude, but anyone who thinks 10% of internet's b2c e-commerce will come from bitcoin anytime within the next 5-10 years, is delusional at best.

I was considering building an escrow service system. Any interest here on reddit assisting with this? Seems like this is the first logical foundation that needs to be built before several other technologies can take off.

That's just how the internet works. It's unfortunate but, when you divide people categorically and take into consideration the rational self interest of human nature, and give it anonymity, you end up with forums / subreddits where a "fanboyish" / almost religious following develops. I've been on the internet a long time and I've seen it happen on hundreds of forums. The minute one person comes forward with anything negative about the cult from which the following was born, prepare to get shit on and flamed. Hard. It's just the way it is.
It just goes to show you that speed and efficiency isn't the most important thing when what you desire is an intelligent, adult discussion. We live in a digital world where an "upvote" or a "like" or "+1" is given out without any real consideration or substantial thought put into content and context, due to the fact that it's so convenient. Put all the variables together and that's what you get... Circlejerk McGerk!
