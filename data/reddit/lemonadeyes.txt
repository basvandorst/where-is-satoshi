Don't forget all the services you take for granted, if you don't pay taxes you are basically stealing from the community. Isn't stealing a crime in itself? Think about it.

Isn't that what all of you bitcoiners are against? Privatization of commodities and basic community services? You guys really need to make up your mind.

I would like to know your solution to pay for roads, schools, firefighters, public hospitals, public assitance, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:25:02
Again, you are putting the blame on the wrong side. You are not looking beyond the mask.

A lot of you blame the government, yet it is not the government itself. It is the people who are in the government, the people who have been bought out by private interests. What would you suggest we should replace the government with? Another governing body? This mentality has to change and try looking beyond what the mainstream had dictated you to believe.

I thought it was because most people evaded taxes and the government ran out of money to keep funding public works/pay their debt.
Also, the restart of their economy where the Greek money would lose value and be in a volatile state so people would rather have Euros because it is more stable.
Wouldn't holding bitcoin just compound to the problems they face since they refuse to change their behavior for the greater good of the community?
Nahhhh, that's has to be wrong. It's because they don't use bitcoin.
edit: from the replies I've gotten, I can tell most bitcoiners only care about one thing: becoming mega super zillionaires. A lot of bitcoiners are malinformed on economics and how the world actually works, a lot of bitcoiners are just conspiracy theorists. I know many bitcoiners are not like that, the loud minority is what the public is hearing.

Please link relevant articles from actual people who are in the political sciences or law fields. Youtube videos are just people pushing their own agenda. You obviously have not stepped beyond the cringey part of "the guvment is out to git us", again read carefully: It is not the government, the government is ok. It is those who are in position of power receiving orders from higher ups.
I suggest practicing better critical thinking skills and research. The hole goes deeper than you think.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:55:08
You basically described why people pay taxes.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:22:31
So you rather be wrong than correct yourself and be right next time, that's fine. Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:40:45
So you have no answer. cool

ask the guys from Alcurex, the owner ended up doing most of the coding himself because indian programmers could not finish the exchange properly

It's a good app and the first step towards mobile btc innovation. I have plenty of history and I approve of this app.

I don't think you understand the amount that is being generated, its miniscule. It is a neutron heavy element, thus you need something like the explosion of a neutron star to get massive amounts. A few atoms of gold hardly can be considered of value.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:40:25
gold is only made in the explosion of a star, we cannot make gold. that's what gives it its value

I found the professional redditor, explain more mr. physicist, of course my years of research are questioned by a professional of your stature /s 
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:31:00
lol, too much pseudo here
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:25:31
Some people actually believe in pseudo science, I've met plenty
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:08:54
So you're saying Satoshi is a 30+ year old virgin redditor?
