lol what's your problem. nobody forces you to use RES, let alone donate anything.
@_date: 2012-11-15 01:36:45
as a long term drug (ab)user, and btc fanatic, i could never understand why people wouldn't just try to get some local connections. i mean, come on; i've lived here and there, and if you use you can recognize a dealer in no time, why bother with e-currencies, deliveries etc.

i had the _SAME_ f***ing problem, i even thought the guy is fooling around - i couldn't find btc option myslef; i refreshed, nothing. cleared the cache, nothing. posted a comment, honestbleeps says the option should be there. 'my bad' i thought, and tried again: this time requesting the page through proxy - still no btc option; tor - the same; so i started to intercept http requests, cutting out and modifying headers - changed UA, no referrer or cookies, no cache-specific headers, not a damn thing that could reveal i'd ever attempted to GET the /page in question before; still no btc option :/ oh and this was routed through tor + fresh proxy to be clear...
baffled i started fresh, jailed instance of google chrome - and i still couldn't see btc donation option. i've made last checks if this wasn't miscoded JS  or CSS, or some unclosed &lt;tag&gt;, and almost posted another, not-so-polite comment, when this bright idea popped into my head: use your phone, grashopper... needless to say, using my beloved mobile, the same freakin url showed btc option like there was nothing to it:| and, mind you, not by 3G, by the same f**king wifi i connect my machine to the internetz with...
you can laugh all you want, but this one will keep me awake for some time
TL;DR dark internet magic; some(?) caching(?) mechanism(?) fails(?) and the btc donation option doesn't show up, but it's there, i assure you.

high-five for your donation; to be honest i don't usually donate to open source projects that much, but i was forced to use 'plain' reddit at my friend's place recently, and oh boy, RES makes all the difference

well i've been thinking about it really hard and changed my mind. if anybody's would set this whole thing up with iama mods, i can give it a shot. what the hell, i might not be the best man for the job, but someone has to do it. given that iama is a default, rather popular subreddit it might echo through the interwebs if done correctly.
if i were to do it, it must be done properly. i would very much count for help of fellow redditors. i wouldn't want to omit any important/interesting questions, or to mislead anyone.
finally, while i love bitcoin as an idea and support it with whole my heart, i have my reservations and will NOT be dishonest. i believe bitcoin is awesome because of the overwhelming advantages&gt;disadvantages ratio, not because of lack of latter.
to be honest i get more and more excited just thinking about it :)

I understand that. Still, I feel like I needed to say this. Things never have been so bad here. If it keeps going downhill in terms of quality, I will simply unsubscribe, sure. But why should I? I'd love to have btc related news/posts popping up on my frontpage, where it can mix with not so serious content, including memes or whatever. And I'd love to have discussions in comments with people I "know" (or at least go over their comment history to not waste my time on trolls), in easy and accessible manner.
I'm not asking for much here. It's only natural for a subreddit that expanded so rapidly to have more of less quality posts, and so it should be natural for mods to step up their game. It's not that we got constant percentage of shit posts, it's that it's almost all we've been getting lately.
My post is only one option, but whatever it would be, something must be done so everyone could enjoy this subreddit, not only quick memes preferring demographic.

although i found archive.org extremely useful on more than a one occasion, i'd really prefer donating to the organizations that focus on more basic needs, like food, shelter, medical aid or educations as in getting access to it (think people building schools in the poorest corners of the world), i believe they need it much more. especially that in the process they might learn about bitcoins (charities that is) which would be double as cool.
this is my incognito reddit account which i post all kind of stupid things on, so i hope you understand if i don't want to link it to my real name persona ;). that said, if you sign a message stating 'i declare donating $xx to yyy.zz' i can go 2btc upfront. please don't take my lack of trust personally. you can always wait for a couple of hours and see how things go if you're still not sure.
as long as i applaud you for donating however much you can spare, i will only tip 5btc for $100. feel free to donate $1000 and blow all of our minds though :)

your mind seems pretty set on that matter, but I'll try anyway: would it be possible to reanimate one of those subreddits with neutral mods in charge? I myself enjoyed it quite a bit and wouldn't mind sacrificing (yeah, right:P) some of my own time to maintain it, ensuring everyone behaves nicely and no rules get broken, eventually getting someone on board that I'd know would do the same. I understand your frustration with former mods (one in particular I guess), but it would be a shame to deprive the rest of us of all the fun because of it.

so they could have accessed your transaction history and password hint, but if i understood correctly they still needed to guess your actual password? i wonder what that was, given that you're 'it professional'.
still, that doesn't excuse strongcoin.com owners (whoever they might be), it's a major fuckup. reimbursing their users would certainly help, but somehow i don't see that happening.
maybe one day services build around managing money will not by created by completely clueless people. i know, i'm a dreamer.

don't get my wrong, I root for Bitcoin with all my heart. but how many 
'investors' do you think will not have they greed overcame by the fear of loss when the price hits the magic mark? and from then the avalanche which stops who knows at what point.
miners won't care, they'll still get the same amount of btc. exchanges won't care, they'll still going to charge the stiff % of every transaction. but the merchants who don't instantly convert their coins to fiat, which imho play the most important part in wider Bitcoin adaptation, they will take a huge blow. and this is not something i would like to see.
and you're completely right, this is very calm, rational way to look at this situation, it's only those 'next week $100 - next year $1000!!!11' kind of posts that make me cringe a little.

I just hope they have their shit secured. I don't imagine anyone bailing them out if they got pwned. And even though I think BTC would recover faster than in 2011 it still would be a major clusterfuck: price plummeting and lots of people loosing their coins for good.
As for all bitching and whining: well, try not using mtgox for a change. 'But liquidity!' I hear you cry - maybe if some of you took your business to other exchanges this wouldn't be a problem anymore. Besides they're not going to move a finger in this matter since they're making many regardless, not to mention their growing user base.

EDIT: disregard this comment, see 
hi all!
thanks for all the flattery, i'm embarrassed to admit it feels pretty good :)
as for your idea, i'm sorry, but i must decline. as i feel pretty confident about my knowledge of bitcoins from technical side, there are many more qualified people who'd do a better job explaining it. i lack language skills and patience to deal with trolling/pure idiocy [seriously, bitcoin is ready to go mainstream, but the mainstream is not quite ready for bitcoin]. plus, i'm completely green when it comes to global economy (although i believe bitcoin will redefine it instead of following its rules).
besides, i value my privacy too much. this is 'ask me anything' we're talking about here. this is my incognito reddit account, for reddit related stuff only. thus, any personal question, i'd have to lie, which kind of beats the whole point.
there are many fine folks in btc community that don't frequent reddit, you could look for someone at bitcointalks etc. an owner of one of the major exchanges would do too, i guess. if you find a feasible canditate, we could always make sure his time and effort is well rewarded - i'd be more than happy to chip in :)

possible, improbable. most of folks who put any serious cash in this know it's an investment for years and realize there might be some major crashes along the way.
it would slow btc adoption, but it wouldn't stop it. they would only waste money - but now when I think about it, they've got lots of experience doing just that, so who knows.
in the long run any cash they'd pump in the btc economy will end up making it stronger imho.
