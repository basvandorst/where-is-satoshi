Good day, everyone!
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:17:59
Good day to all!
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:17:14
Oh, no!!!
That means he is also the main trombonist and founder of the Genesis band...
Oh, well...
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:03:06
No, but then again I wouldn't borrow, period (except if it was for medical/health reasons, or so).
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:18:32
Flux capacitors, mate...simple as that.
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:26:03
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:28:32
Good moooooooorniiiiing!!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:44:58
Yes, you do.
The very moment your sell order gets fulfilled, your money is available to do whatever you want with it (transfer it to a bank, rebuy BTC and/or alts etc.).
Just keep an eye on the fees (buy and sell using the Limit option, reduced fees).
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:21:34
All you need is another crescendo and you'll be just fine.
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:20:54
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:15:38
I can wait...
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:57:28
That's it.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:46:41
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:37:23
Good day, people!
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:38:24
Pardon my ignorance but, what/who the heck is Slush and who is Ben Verret?
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:44:57
Beautiful! Bravo!
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:13:55
Hang in there, buddy.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:29:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-27 07:06:47
Good morning to all!
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:52:41
Phack'em, I've used Binance to buy/sell alts two or three times but I stopped being bothered with them the moment I stopped being bothered with alts.
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:03:15
You shouldn't be bothered with the FB in the first place...
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:47:39
An Alfa-Romeo hodler? Oh, man, this is not going to end nicely...
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:15:14
Will it die young?
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:11:04
Naaah, too "linear" and symmetric.
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:11:03
Good day to everyone!
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:39:22
Bloody hell!
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:46:02
Well, it's $5.1K now so there you go.
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:01:52
Although usually predictions come with a specific timeframe, sounds more like wishful thinking than a prediction.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:52:04
Yes, if you think that $3100 was the bottom, no, if you have the feeling that we are in the slope of a dead cat.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:44:41
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:50:59
Good day!
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:29:19
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:15:03
Makes you thing, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:17:16
Good on you, mates!
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:17:53
Looks fantastic, mate!
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:14:21
And good day, to all!
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:12:18
Both are good, I could have gotten either (or both). I own a couple of Ledgers and never had a prob so far.
@_date: 2019-04-17 07:41:49
Good morniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:25:43
Actually, he trades.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:46:06
And once again, good morning cryptocurrency maniacs!
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:39:52
Good day, hodlers, shorters, coiners and no-coiners!
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:33:09
Doesn't matter, no matter if it goes up or down, I am ready so bring it on...
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:12:55
And yet another beautiful day! Good morning ya all and keep smiling!
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:48:02
Well, is it? Not in my experience.
@_date: 2019-04-16 07:12:26
Your bird is right, I am in the northen hemisphere right now and it's just beautiful.
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:40:28
Sounds legit.
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:57:18
It's a trap!
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:24:59
Good point.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:58:28
Good on you, buddy!
Make it 5-10 years and for the love of God, buy a HW or keep your keys safe on paper.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:59:37
OK, it's official. *Now*, I've seen it all.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:57:05
Here's my take; Concepts like "overbought" and "oversold" are kind of arbitrary in speculative markets.
Still, every time I zoom out a BTC price chart I get the same impression as you.
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:58:36
A whole coin? Like a whole Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:56:06
Good point.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:14:28
I think that you meant, WAIT to find out.
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:47:19
Hahahahahaha, ingenious!
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:43:39
Well, I always kinda liked Motley Crue but I have the feeling there is yet another Tommy Lee in this world. I wonder if he plays the drums as well... 
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:40:26
Are we still talking about cryptocurrency, here? Because neither of these links has anything to do with it.
BTW, I don't have to prove anything as you certainly don't have to oversimplify/generalise everything.
Have a good one.
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:43:11
A hodler just buys from time to time and hodles their entire portfolio. Coiners may or may not trade from time to time for profit or to minimize their (current) losses, I reckon.
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:47:53
No problem, just take this with a grain of salt as these "concepts" are kind of vague anyway. ;)
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:22:05
Well, THAT'S art!
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:09:02
What a clawn...
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:51:18
The problem with all these ATMs, no matter where they are located is the crazy fees/commisions.
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:19:47
I dare you to fire it up, as it is right now!
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:15:48
What if you are not an American?
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:40:03
Naaah, If I were to play along with this diagram I would first switch it to log and I would say that we are probably somewhere between "bull trap" and "return to normal". 
But who knows, time will tell.
@_date: 2019-04-12 08:08:43
Good morning, still at $5K.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:56:14
Overreacting a bit?
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:12:51
Good on you.
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:28:34
In Bitcoin we trust?
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:50:33
Thumbs up to these guys for accepting BTC, but zero confirmations? That's a bit odd...
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:44:43
@_date: 2019-04-15 07:36:47
Yet another beautiful spring day! Good day guys and gals!
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:55:52
TAs are all about probability. Probability doesn't mean that you can be absolute sure that something will or won't happen.But even if you are sure about that, chances are you won't be sure on WHEN exactly it will happen.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:04:49
Good day, guys and gals!
@_date: 2019-04-11 09:01:59
Another beautiful day, ladies and gentlemen!
Have a good one!
@_date: 2018-11-14 07:09:35
Good morning!!!
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:17:21
Good mooooorniiiiiiing!!!
@_date: 2018-12-30 07:02:33
G'day guys and gals!
