On  it says "released as a hard fork or sidechain of Bitcoin"...

Maybe you would get upvotes if you explained your skepticism more

He has a slide show about that: 
In general, he tries to do in the software what 'real people do' when they are deciding on something.
In an email to me, he described it as "consistency-based redistribution of ownership in an abstract corporation which exists to prove its reliability over time + markets with changing prices".

Nothing comes to mind.

Looks cool to me, but on  it says "released as a hard fork or sidechain of Bitcoin". I know sidechains are good, but aren't hard forks bad? I know one happened in March 2013 which was apparently bad.

It is a pitch deck which doesn't ask for any money...so what exactly are you asking people to stay away from?
1) There is an entire "Papers" page which contains a 40 page whitepaper.
2) There are other presentations about the valuation, and logic behind the initial distributions and why they are relevant.
3) People already have built a versions of it: they are under GitHub, Demo, and Downloads pages.
Pitch decks are usually very high-level and straight to the point.

Yes it was. You couldn't even make it to the second and third words of the page?

Competition is also healthy.

If only the FAQ contained a question like "If you built something like this, what use would people get out of it?"
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:15:34
In the FAQ, he outlines some problems with crime-markets:

He isn't?
