Not if Bitfinex keeps printing 100 million tether a day and buying bitcoin with said tether at 500 dollars over market value.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:12:44
They won't get audited because that would ruin the scam. The very fact that we had to find out about bitfinex being owned by the same guys as tether through the "paradise papers"-leak (which is a huge conflict of interest and something they should have told from the get-go) is EXTREMELY sketchy. 
How do they acquire 100 million dollars a day when most banks have stopped working with them? Shit smells very fishy to me.

US retained its elected president and it's territorial integrity as the rebels lost. 
What do you think it more likely, the US purposefully destroying its currency and economy for shits and giggles, or bitcoin being fairly unstable for the foreseeable future?

The instructions not to invest anything you are willing to lose are plastered EVERYWHERE. C'mon man... 
That being said you're in quite a precarious situation here my friend. Maybe sell and cut your losses? Maybe hope the value goes up? Nobody can say as the crypto market is driven by speculation. Follow your gut.

That seems to imply bitcoin would lessen poverty, if the current system causes it. Keynesian economic policy has made a massive rise in the quality of life; life expectancy has gone up  on every continent, the amount of poverty in the world is falling constantly.
In 1990 over 40% of the world lived in extreme poverty, the world bank is aiming to lower extreme poverty to 9% by 2020 and eradicate extreme poverty completely by 2030. 


 
You think businesses would change that if bitcoin was used? Why? They could just continue doing the same, only now instead of investing it, creating more jobs and better products, they can just haul it into the vault for the price to inflate. The world would be Much poorer without the current system of inflation. Deflation would mainly benefit the rich who would literally just accumulate money into some vault instead of putting it back into the economy.
 &gt; and asset bubbles that favour the wealthy over those who actually work.
You think the poor of the world are the ones investing in bitcoin or suffering losses from keeping large amounts of money money in the bank? 
The poor would suffer from the introduction of an inflexible and stagnant or volatile and deflationary currency.

First of all, you have to transfer your money from dollars to bitcoins, send it over, then your mother needs to trade it from bitcoin to local currency. Then you have to worry about the price changing during the wire. so you got two conversions from crypto to Fiat + transfer costs + changes in price.

Why save tho when you can buy things that appreciate in value? I don't think poor peoples problem is that all that money that they keep for decades in the bank is depreciating, that's a rich persons problem. His video stated that most people in the world don't have access to banking services. I you can't even get to a bank, do you really think you got a 10k retirement?

Might have something to do with the gambling nature of the game. Many gamblers might get a 300% return and continue to play until they lose all their money. Some people don't know to stop playing when they're at the top. "I'll get the money back for sure, I'm on a winning streak, I can't lose, I've already won a lot so I'll continue winning"

The issuer government seems to have not been overthrown since it's inception in 1776 and has never defaulted on it's loans. I am curious as to how the US dollar could be "destroyed" in one day. If only all these fools would use a stable currency like bitcoin amirite?

25% of africans have internet access, the folks that do have internet are not the poorest ones. 


So crypto gives you the logistical capability to sell internationally? What middle man gets cut out from the process if you acquire crypto? Does crypto eliminate the need for a website to sell stuff on? Does crypto suddenly build infrastructure for him to send the product worldwide? Does crypto cut out the truck drivers, post men, ups drivers, shipping captains ect? 
If the mask is worth 200 dollars somewhere else, he can just sell it on ebay. 


Food is perishable, that's why you don't see milk being shipped into africa, not because of some evil "middle men". Evn if crypto somehow magically made food non perishable, it would totally ruin the local agricultural farms that don't have modern tools of economies of scale. 


What workers are you talking about here? Most things are made in factories, the singular workers don't own the products and I doubt some chinese factory worker has either the knowhow, materials or tools to manufacture microprosessors, let alone an entire computer by himself. 


How is that not possible today? Crypto won't eliminate tariffs, taxes and shipping costs.

Greece had huge "federal debt" and it's bubble burst big time. The key here is to compare GDP/Debt ratios and such, if I recall correctly Greece had about 150% more debt than GDP.
Thing is though, the US has never defaulted on debt so it's a very attractive investment. Other investments are often compared to the US treasury bonds, which are considered the safest investments out there, they are called "risk free assets".

Infaltion is not necessarily a bad thing, take Russia for example. Russia exports lots of oil, the price of oil dropped a lot a couple of years back but their currency also got inflated -&gt; Now they still get the same amount of rubles from the oil even though the price of oil dipped drastically. Inflation is good for exports, importing becomes more expensive but it can also give a boost to local production when making the stuff locally is cheaper.
Deflation on the other hand freezes economies. Imagine you bought a house a year ago on a 100 bitcoin loan, now the price of bitcoin has jumped and you have no way to pay back. The super rich hoard money already, even with inflation. Imagine how bad it would get if  they could just put their money into a vault and have it appreciate instead of having to invest it back into the economy.
Things are not black and white in economics.

It's open source though, anyone can do the exact same thing, and some are doing it better than bitcoin already.
Value transfer protocol of the future, with sluggish speeds and high transfer costs, not to mention the price can fluctuate substantially before your coin reaches the other end. 
If I want to transfer money to a friend business or anyone else locally, I use "mobile pay", the money goes straight from my account to theirs in a second. 
If I need to buy something online abroad , I use my card, which is also pretty much instantaneous. I bought a vintage 80's adidas sweater off ebay today and it was a breeze.
I also had to borrow some money off a pal today, which is really not stressful for either of us because the value of the Euro is pretty darn stable. Neither of us is losing a penny. 
Why would I have done ANY of these things using bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ripple ect? Why would I ever want to "transfer value" using cryptos? (Ill give you a hint, been using cryptos since 2014 ;) )

Eh, I think it's a shitty currency when prices fluctuate so much. I spent most of my bitcoin on "purchases" a long time ago, and boy does it sting. With no other currency do I think "hmmm, should I hold my euros or go buy food?" or "I wanted to buy a car last week but the euro dropped 9% and I can't afford it anymore".

I don't get why you'd buy things in bitcoin tho? I mean unless it's illegal stuff.

I can go to a shop and buy a can of soda for money, I don't have to transfer any money through wallets, lose money exchanging it, wait for the transaction to complete, worry if I can buy the can of soda because the rate is different, worry if they printed the price 24 or 48 hours ago, wonder if 0.0007 bitcoins for a can of soda is a good deal, worry about holding or making the purchase ect...

Only problem is that due to volatility and high deflation it's not a currency. 
I don't understand what the big problem with banks is. I have never had to pay any transaction fees, or any fees to my bank. All I've gotten is a little interest on my savings. Someone care to elaborate?

Ok, why would people want to do that? Do you realize the downsides of that might not be worth the advantages to the average person? 
Why would I want to purhase my clementines anonymously or without a bank/institution? I just don't see these things being big problems for people. So what if the government knows I bought items to make a carbonara and I have never had any issues with my bank. Bitcoin fixes something that is not a problem for 99.9 percent of people, while having huge disadvantages compared to other payment methods.

it hodls up pretty well: Internet and blockchain are the things that the government says have a lot of future potential but need regulation. 
This does not mean all websites or all cryptos have inherent potential for being based on these technologies.
Same thing happened before "Oh! The internet is the future, gobble up these future companies while you can!", only this time it's "coins" not stocks. 
The stocks that turned out to be profitable belong to companies that generate billions in revenue, employ thousands of people and provide invaluable services for modern living where as bitcoin... bitcoin just kinda exists :/

Eletric cars were also popular in the early 1900s but big oil/GM/Ford and battery technology kept it from gaining the upper hand. 
Eletric car backed by gas? Tf you on about? You need motorised transportation to go long distances from point A to point B. You don't need bitcoin to store value or transfer money.

What about smartphones? 10 years ago it was a gimmic, now everyone and their grandparents has had one for 5 years.
The tech cycle goes at a faster speed than at the beginning of the 20th century. 10 years in tech is a massive amount of time and time won't change the core of the tech, which is not really useful for the layman. 
Edit: Comparing Bitcoin, essentially a payment system amongst thousands of others, to a novel invention that revolutionised the human species and shaped our environment, is ridiculous and misleading. It's not like bitcoin is either the best, only or first currency/store of value.

They believe in blockchain, Bitcoin does not own blockchain tech, neither does any crypto.
Take the tech bubble, just because the government says "the internet is the future" does not mean that poop.com is the future. poop.com does not own the internet, it is built on the internet but totally worthless.
