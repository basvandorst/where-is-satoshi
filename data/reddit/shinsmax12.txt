Coinbase has FDIC, but it only applies to USD deposits, not any Crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:35:36
USD sitting in a Coinbase account is insured only. If you send money to them then convert to crypto it is not insured anymore. 
Sort of like a brokerage account. Your funds sitting in the account are insured, but you AAPL stock is not.

That's not quite what inflation is. Inflation has to do with purchasing power. If bitcoin was truly inflationary,  your purchasing power with bitcoin would be decreasing instead of increasing which has been the overall trend since its inception.

If you are looking for a safe haven you wouldn't dollar cost average, you would move from the risky assets into the safe haven. Why would you go half way if you were truly concerned with your current equity position? 
Bitcoin just dropped 14% in 2 days. How can that be considered in any way a safe haven asset? Similarly with the previous run-up, I would never expect a safe haven to gain nearly 50% in a short amount of time. The violatility is insane! Safe haven's typically gain 1-2% and do so *reliably.* That is what makes them safe. 
You shouldn't have to time your entry and exit into a safe haven position because you are already doing that when you exit your equity position. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:59:49




Wut? How are you supposed to dollar cost average into a "safe haven." You move assets away from equities and into safe havens in large chunks, not a few dollars here, a few dollars there.

The conditions that resulted in the government confiscating gold in the 1930s is totally different than anytime we have seen since. If the government was going to seize private property, they would do better by seizing and selling land (can't hide or smuggle away land). Since the dollar isn't tied to gold anymore, it just doesn't make sense to go after that commodity.

People are sinking a lot more money into USD than even Precious metals.  The Dollar IS gold to many people. And absolutely no liquidity issues. 
You will probably not see any movement in the price of gold, except maybe down, because of the strengthening Dollar.

Great analysis. The thing that must not be forgotten is that normally the trading volume is very low which means that there will be extremely high price volatility as well as bubbles easily forming.

Methinks many governments may not like this proposition.  Additionally, until the volatility issue is resolved widespread use of bitcoin will not happen. Are merchant s expected to change their prices every few hours to accurately reflect the cost of their goods?

Bitcoin will only really become valuable once it is used primarily as a means to purchases goods and services instead of an instrument with which to trade against other currency. People won't really start using it as currency until it stables in price because who in there right mind would pay for a $100 item today with money that will be worth $130 tomorrow?

Why would anyone insure Bitcoin? The government certainly wouldn't get involved in that. Insurance for depositors is not something that has resulted due to the "invisible hand" of the free-market.

My biggest concern with BTC is that it seems like most of its liquidity revolves around currency trading. I would feel a lot more comfortable about the long term prospects if it was primarily used in the purchase of goods and services.

I like the idea of Bitcoin, but I hate the idea that it is somehow going to replace the dollar. Bitcoin is a great way to make transactions online, anonymously, if you so choose. 
Stop talking about Bitcoin as a defense against hyperinflation or any of that other "kill the fed" garbage. It just marginalizes Bitcoin and scares people away. Your best way to increase the value of Bitcoin is to increase the number of people using it, but that is never going to happen if Bitcoin is lumped in with all the Daily Paul conspiracy bullshit.

Private insurance doesn't cover cash. The only thing that insures the safety of your deposited financial assets is the FDIC which is a government corporation, and they only cover up to $250,000 per person per financial institution.

For Bitcoin's own good, it would best to stop celebrating the incredible rise in price. If anyone is truly interested in it's long term viability as a currency, the price needs to begin to stabilize. I know it isn't sexy, but currency speculation doesn't provide a lot of security for consumers or businesses.

When you can pay your taxes with BTC, then we can talk. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:50:43
Agreed. No one ever went poor taking a profit. Using scales to buy and sell is a great way to cost average on the way down and take profits on the way up since the likelihood of pegging the market at highs and lows is highly unlikely.

It pretty much is exactly like a penny stock. There really is no inherent value in BTC. It's only valuable because people think it is valuable, or will be valuable. There are almost no fundamentals to judge its worth by so really its just a crap shoot. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:47:01
Yes, but when I buy a stock I have a fairly good idea of what types of earnings they bring in as a company. I am willing to not receive a dividend if I believe the company will use that money to create growth or reinvestment.
There is pretty much no way to evaluate the true value of a BTC (as far as I am aware). The only thing really pushing the price right now is all this sentiment and belief that the price will just continue to go up.
