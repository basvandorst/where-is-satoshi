I have an idea of how bad it is....it is pretty bad! but check this rankings:
Philippinnes is not on top of the list but way more corrupted than U.S.

Phillippines is one the most corrupted countries in the world.... I would not call "Banks in the Philippines mining Bitcoin" as a progress. Biiiiiiiiiitconnnnneeeeeeect!

Crypto is too small.... let us play alone we are just kids

unbelievable how BTC fundamentals are better than ever but price seems to be crashing again...

I would like to understand if this is true or not. Does the lightning network fix this problem?

IMO Venezuela is the perfect example of a country that NEEDS a currency like Bitcoin... it is not the first one and it won't be the last one

Pretty good insight! I have been arguing with myself the same: should I just buy and hold BTC or get mining rigs??! I guess buy and hold...

If I was a student I would do exactly the same! 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:43:39
I guess not!

isn't Ethereum also an alt coin? I might be wrong on this... I think investing in Bitcoin is "the safest bet" but not the best. There are a few quality alt coins that will outperform BTC like ICX, ADA and IOTA. What do you guys think?
