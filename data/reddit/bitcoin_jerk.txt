What about displaying btc in 8 decimals and fiat in 2 decimals at the same time? I think from UX perspective, fiat should only be 2 decimals and btc 8 decimals with option to change. How can I do that?

I had them laying in bittrex. I paid something like 0.001 BTC, which is their withdrawal fee.

Hey cool thing you did there, I bought it last night. Is there a way to display fiat currencies in 2 decimals instead of 8?

Awesome! Thanks

Actually you don't need the programming skills anymore.

As soon as I have some free time, I will redesign this for you.

I'm not saying you should replace your payment options, just offer cryptos as an extra option. 
In my case it's 'rational' as you say, as I sell websites/apps, not coffee.

Use a monotype font for the code instead of cursive.

I'll probably doing manually since updating is not that hard. Thanks for your reply.

Those people either truly believe in the technology or they want to sell you their coins. Never take financial advice from reddit comments or news outlets.

They didn't even bother changing the copyright on the footer. Looks scammy!

In other words a 50% drop and 50% increase. The analysis is strong with this one.

You shouldn't be concerned, this move will create more exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:43:00
You don't have to move it to make profit, just trade on both exchanges.

If I were you I would invest 1% of my savings. Get a hardware wallet, fund it, store it in a safe and forget about it. Come back in 5 years.

Hello, front-end dev/ux designer here. I want to help too, I believe good UX will lead to mass adoption. 
My question is, can I do this on Homebrew? 
I'm installing bitcoin 
    brew install bitcoin 
which I guess was renamed from bitcoind. I can start the service with 
    brew services start bitcoin
But how do I know if it was synchronised? I can only read started or stopped. 
I'm probably doing this wrong though, can you please help? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:59:43
You might want to release that on Github. Looks fishy when it isn't open source.
Happy holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:18:06
If you want to help with Bitcoin adoption just start accepting payments in Bitcoin.

If you trust them with your bitcoins you can leave it there. 
If not, the cheapest way is to sign up with GDAX (which is basically Coinbase's exchange). This way you can move your bitcoins free. From GDAX, you would want to withdraw to somewhere safer, eg. a hardware wallet you bought or some other company you trust. GDAX will not charge you with the network fee (that goes to miners). They will pay it for you.
