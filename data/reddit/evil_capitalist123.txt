Yup. I had an SL1 that looked just like this one. Got around 40mpg on the standard shift and drove it until I had over 170k miles on it. Never had any mechanical problems. Great car.

That could definitely be one monetization scheme, like the micro-payments mentioned in the article.
I also wonder if blockchain technology could be applied to DNS. Instead of having centralized DNS servers, we have a "blockchain" of domain names that are attached to IP addresses, which is distributed globally and verified like bitcoin transactions.

Awesome! I was just kicking this idea around last week after reading about the mesh networks in Afghanistan and Africa that are used to push internet connections out into remote areas. Wouldn't it be fantastic if the internet were completely decentralized in a way that the government couldn't touch it at all? We already have the technology. In my (probably flawed) vision, each home would have their own server which would act as a node and connect it to all of the other nodes around it. The nodes would basically just be another household appliance and the value of your property would be partially affected by the quality of the nodes around it. That's a very simplified version of what I was thinking, but weirdly similar to this article.
EDIT: all of this would depend on the wifi band, to be clear, not necessarily wired connections
EDIT: this is the article that inspired this train of thought for me:  . It's an open sourced linux based mesh network built partially out of the garbage found in 3rd world countries.

The only crypto-currency I am familiar with is Bitcoin. So... I have no clue.

Humor bro. :)
Sending money out of the country by migrant workers is a touchy subject in the USA.

Right! Bandwidth would be significantly lower than it is now, in the beginning, but they are achieving some pretty impressive speeds in Africa. Something like 30 mbps after 6 node jumps! That's faster than most people get for their paid broadband services. If the infrastructure was set up properly, you could probably cover damn near the whole planet in 6 node jumps.
Here's a link to the system that got me thinking:
