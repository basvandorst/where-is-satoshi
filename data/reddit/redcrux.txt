that would imply that there are more people (10-100 times?) who's primary reason for not getting into bitcoin is the high fees. We already know that many lower income countries are completely priced out of it at the moment. So this would mean that fee's are definitely hindering adoption.

Bitcoin isn’t doing anything to fiat, the us government is inflating fiat. Plus they can’t shoot a block chain and they can’t enforce laws on citizens of other countries.

No, I think you missed my point, centralization is not the problem, it's corruption. Any scaling solution will lead to some form of centralization because it's practically required for the scale of a global currency. It's possible to be centralized but not able to be corrupted because the underlying protocol is sound and voted on by people with consensus mechanisms. LN is over top of bitcoin and outside of it's rules, no consensus, this means it's easily corrupted. It allows LN's final form to be no different than the crappy fiat system we have now.  
  
The entire purpose of bitcoin is to be better than fiat, not fall into the same traps. I thought we wanted to give a fuck you to the central banks who fucked us all in 2009, not birth a new one.  
  
I don't give a shit about the value of any individual coin, I hold them all. I just don't want so many people to get tricked into thinking they are getting the future of money when really they are getting "fiat central bank 2.0".

There's absolutely no profit or point to a miner spamming the network. They would lose more in fees than they gain.
  
Any spam transactions with too low fees will not be mined anyways so it doesn't take up space for users transactions and any spam transactions with too high fees costs too much. Plus it's not like a miner gets all the transactions back so they can recoup their costs, they have to compete with every other miner getting the blocks that contain their transactions.

Value = Demand/Supply  
  
If you decrease demand for the USD, because everyone wants and values bitcoin more, than your value decreases. The same number of dollars exist but each one buys less goods and services when those people would rather have bitcoin. YOu don't actually destroy dollars to end fiat, you just let it run it's natural course.
  
The extreme end of it is that everyone is left with a pile of worthless USD and just uses bitcoin (see Zimbabwe and Venezuela)

the "bug" is that they can mine blocks without transactions by analyzing the merkle tree. This gets them the next block faster but doesn't do any useful work for the system.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:50:38
Even if they are flooding low fee Txns those transactions are not getting processed so they aren't taking up blockspace from legitimate users. If a miner set their fee high enough to get mined and block legitimate users then they would go broke in no time. They could set a low fee floor easily but the only reason the fee keeps rising is because more and more people want to transact and are willing to pay more and more to do it. If there were actually WAY less legitimate transactions then the fee would drop and no amount of spam would keep it up because it would be a waste of money.  
  
Miners can't affect that dynamic.

There are threads around that talk about the maximum value. Basically, if bitcoin's market cap reached the level of gold ($7.8T - a relatively small part of the overall money supply), each bitcoin would be worth ~$250,000 - ~$500,000. And that's not even the maximum.  
  
When bitcoin reaches it's maximum, you won't make sense to denominate it in dollars any more.

So? if a miner sets a 10 sat/b fee you should be able to get in for 11 sat/b. The miners don't want to lose money to fees so they would only set a fee that doesn't have a chance of getting mined. Everything above that means that someone else is actually trying to make a legitimate transaction and filling the blocks.  
  
If the miners set a floor at 100 sat/byte then the only reason it's 300+ right now is because there are MORE people trying to transact than the network can handle so the miners 100 sat/byte is not having an impact at all.

3) He didn't think transaction fees and transfer times would ever be an issue because he assumed that the future developers would enact a sliding block size increase so that fees would remain stable as demand increased.

The US dollar is designed to maintain 2% annual inflation. That means your dollars lose 2% each year. The money supply is adjusted by the federal reserve to maintain this inflation forever.  
  
Bitcoin does not have that "feature" it's value is based on whatever people think it's worth. All factors remaining constant, USD would be worth 2% less and bitcoin would be worth the same, which would give the appearance that bitcoin is worth 2% more each year (if you measured in USD). What happens beyond that is outside of the scope of the design of bitcoin. There are no central banks here so it's value is pure.  
  
When people refer to bitcoin being deflationary they mean that it's supply is actually shrinking as people lose their coins or die without an heir. This will drive prices up in the long run but the price is not what they mean by inflationary/deflationary. They are purely talking about supply because no one knows what the demand will be in 10 years

Do LN transactions generate fees? Yes. So there is incentive to create hubs, the more transactions you funnel the more fees you collect. However you are correct that a hub will be expensive and you need merchant connections, which is why only the biggest corporations/banks will own one. Also, it's not just users that don't want to open hundreds of channels. You think starbucks wants to open millions of channels? How much capital would that tie up?


  
That's not what I was implying, I was implying that anyone NOT on a hub will need far more hops to get to their destination. Mostly likely one of those hops will be through a major hub as the step right before the merchant. More hops = more fees and the hub would get a fee no matter what (because the merchants are on the hubs). So why wouldn't the average user just connect to a hub instead of using a more expensive decentralized path?  
  


  
For now, but LN can be modified in the future because it's completely independent of the bitcoin protocol. It only has to follow the rules once it makes its final settlement. As more layers (see group lightning network layer 3) and more adoption takes place, settlement will be rarely needed, then never needed. Users chance to have a say in the future of bitcoin ended with segwit.

If two things have value, you can exchange one for the other, or represent one in terms of value of the other (BTC/USD) but that does not mean that one "backs" the other.  
  
I can show an exchange rate of 12 eggs/USD. That means that 12 eggs are worth the same value as $1 USD, that does not mean that Eggs value is backed by USD. Even if USD didn't exist, and we used schmekles people still want to eat eggs so they would still have the equivalent value in schmekles.
  
Right now everyone has fiat so we show BTC's value in terms of fiat money but that is not where BTC get's it's value from, it's not backed by fiat, it has value on it's own.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:08
that's because fees move linearly up to a point, once the transactions exceed block capacity it's exponential growth as people outcompete eachother for a transaction. The limit is reached when the fee exceeds people's wallet balance or willingness to transfer. At that point they are "locked in".  
  
When the price is dropping due to FUD people begin to think about moving their coins to sell. However, they also worry about getting "locked in" and being a bag-hodler, so they sell instead of waiting to see if it recovers, increasing transactions.  A vicious cycle really, like a stampede for the exit in a burning building they will trample eachother.

If you are referring to tethers as the counterfiet USD then it's because when people think everyone else is transferring value to an asset like Bitcoin they believe in has more value (percieved value). If it turns out Bitcoin has been bought with fake dollars than it has less percieved value in the eyes of the buyers.
The real value might be far less than the percieved value  or far more, but no one knows at this point. The price is based on percieved value so if people panic the price will go down regardless of the real value.

It's impossible to prove a negative, as in, it's impossible to prove that the Tethers are not backed by USD. Tether has had problems with banks in the past and It's unclear whether or not they actually have the ability to transmit and store as much USD as the Tethers they are releasing (~10M per day average last I read). Tether conveniently claims they ARE backed but won't produce a verifiable 3rd party audit.  
  
So right now, no one knows but it's pretty clear that there is no proof they ARE legitimate. Even though they have had plenty of opportunity to prove otherwise, so we can only assume that they are NOT legitimate.

1) Mining can use renewable energy, but even fossil fuel generated electricity has a low environmental impact compared to say actually burning diesel fuel with a few dozen bulldozers in a strip mine. There is also the idea that perhaps the hashing algorithm could one day be designed to fold proteins and perform calculations like a supercomputer. It hasn't been invented yet but the idea is already there.  
  
2) Get used to it, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Our entire modern society is set up to function that way and bitcoin isn't going to make it worse. Keep in mind that the fiat money that we all use depreciates over time as more is printed, in a bitcoin based economy a poor person can work and save for a long time and not be at a disadvantage due to inflation losses over decades. In our current system a poor person can never be more wealthy unless you are also getting pay raises each year that beat inflation, which is much more likely in the highest earners. Bitcoin economy doesn't need raises because your 5,000,000 satoshi life savings will be still be valuable, it also doesn't need you to invest that money into risky stock markets (putting that money into the pockets of the rich bankers most of the time) in order to afford retirement, it's FAR more equitable.

Generally, I agree, but it's very unlikely that it goes perfectly vertical. Assuming that trend continued we'd be nearing 100% adoption, where the entire global money supply is in bitcoin within a few years. Policy makers just can't move that fast, the population can't be educated that fast, and colossal banking entities can't change over that fast.  
  
Hell, bitcoin can't even scale that fast, not even with LN.

I'm a LOT more inclined to believe the 2016 - Present and earlier columns are more correct than the inflated 30,60,90 days of this recent bull run.  
For that to be true, we would most likely experience at least a 50-80% drop in the coming year but still would recover to $30,000 by mid 2018. For reference, the price channel that bitcoin's been in since 2012 has a floor near $2000 at the moment. We are currently far above the top of the channel, could be over extending or It could be the start of a new trend in 2017.
Even if we are in a new trend that's been in play in 2017 then we are above its top too, it's floor is around $6000.  
  
I'm just trying to show how insane bitcoin price is right now. No matter how you look at it we are going hyper-exponential which is rarely sustained for long no matter how aggressive the asset. The only hope is that user growth is exponential and that we are hitting the hyper-exponential part of the "growth S-curve".

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:46:38


  
Game theory. Sure, anyone can run a node. The problem is that People and businesses are only going to want to open as few channels as possible with highly connected nodes (hubs) to avoid excessive fees and the hassle of managing thousands of channels. There is also the problem of preferring to connect to nodes with high balances to avoid rejected payments due to lack of funds.  
  
Walmart will have a node but it will only open a channel with a bank level node because it's far simpler to route all customer purchases though one or two common payment providers than millions of customers. Since all the customers of Walmart will have to hop through this bank level node to get to Walmart anyways, the customers will also open channels with this node because no one wants to pay higher fees if they don't have to. Other businesses see that this hub has 1000's of users and partnered with Walmart so they will open up channels with just this hub as well.  
  
The system will naturally centralize itself over time because that's the most efficient form of network architecture. Bitcoin is decentralized, this is not efficient, LN will be more efficient because it's centralized. Now That's not really a problem until you think that the LN is completely separate of bitcoin protocol and can be modified at will without a fork consensus. LN could be modified to a fractional reserve lending situation between hubs without bitcoin being able to do shit about it as long as the final closing works out. That's why the real purpose of segwit was never to increase transaction throughput, it simply enables the LN.   
  
There are already 3rd layers planed that will make settling on the blockchain be never needed at all. Do you understand what that implies?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:01
It's a mining technology that no one else has, that allows them to mine empty blocks at a faster rate. This does no work for the network processing transactions. There isn't really any manipulation other than that and it would resolve itself naturally over time as the reward from mining transaction fees outweights the empty block reward.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:12:22


  
That doesn't take into account that the number of users does not always increase linearly with time. The number of users can grow exponentially once a technology reaches mainstream adoption.  
  
  
  
We will follow metcalf's law during periods of stable linear growth but bitcoin's network growth won't always be linear. We need to continuously pressure the owners of bitcoin's infrastructure (coinbase, other exchanges, and wallets) to be implementing the improvements the developers are releasing in order to prevent stagnation and decline.  
  
If the protocol can handle 1,000,000 TPS but the infrastructure isn't there when it hits mainstream we will crumble under the load. Once bitcoin's reputation is trashed because of high fees and slow confirmations the users we lose won't come back. First impressions are everything, especially when you're looking at adoption on the global level.

The block size is only as large as it needs to be to process the transactions currently in the mempool. Once the backlog is cleared the blocksize would decrease to whatever the current transaction volume is at the moment.  
  
Once LN is in place and transactions move off chain the block size would drop again. Just because your MAXIMUM block size is 1GB does not mean that every block is 1GB, especially if transactions aer moving off-chain. The chain would not end up much larger just by having a few months of big blocks to keep up with demand

Yeah, I mean it completely depends on what indicator you're using to determine oversold but IMO although we are due for a bounce we haven't reached "a good time to buy" yet.  
  
The signal I'm getting now is the same as 3/10/17 and 6/15/17, a 4 hr trend bottom. it was a decent low but rebounded and then dropped twice after that. I'm waiting for the same level of signal I got on 3/24/17 which was the daily trend low. The signals I got on 7/14, 9/15, and 11/12 were all 4hr trend signals *and* 1D trend signals combined which is a much stronger indicator of a quick dip and recover, this isn't looking the same as those on my charts.

Answer this question then: Why wasn't there a chance to get community consensus aka why wasn't there a fork needed, to enable LN?  
  
It's because LN *only requires* segwit to attach it self to bitcoin. The developers sold us on segwit slipping in a soft fork so it wouldn't cause an uproar and then force LN on us with no consensus. It's bait and switch. That's why anyone who didn't want the centralization of LN had to fork themselves off before segwit activated.  
  
So it conveniently looks like they are the fork-coin when really they preserved the original coin. Segwit should have been the hard fork and we would have seen the real situation.

Bitcoin is nowhere near 24000 tps so the block size would NOT be 5.76 gigs. We could have an unlimited block size and the blocks would only be big enough to clear out this backlog and then decrease in size to the normal average transaction amount. Bitcoin cash has 100kb block sizes right now, if they had all the transactions of the bitcoin network they would be at 1MB blocks just like bitcoin is now. The maximum block size is only used when needed, like right now.
  
This would make bitcoin usable until the LN has time to be developed and adopted. Then the block size would decrease again as there would be even less transactions on-chain. Right now bitcoin is barely functioning just because people want to save 1 GB on their precious hard drives in the 12 or so months it will take until LN is in full effect.

One day you find out that your neighbors and friends are buying houses with monopoly money disguised as dollars, counterfeits. They have unlimited supplies of these fake dollars and are using it to buy houses from people like you, raising the price.
  
Do you think your houses are still worth $500,000? Do you trust these people who are rigging the system to pay you a fair amount and buy your house with real dollars? You thought it was a hot market but really it's all fake dollars, there is actually way less real interest in these houses they are trying to sell you. So the houses are worth WAY less than you think they are. The scammers walk away with your real dollars and gave you an asset that they bought at an extremely elevated price using fake money. Now that you know about the fake dollars you are looking to sell your house for $500,000 real dollars but there is no one who wants it for that price.

No because the opportunity cost is that you buy bitcoin now instead of mining it.  
  
Example:   
$3000 miner hardware with a 1yr payback time assuming a 50% gain of bitcoin price = you earn $3000 worth of bitcoin spaced over a year, your btc amount mined gets smaller and smaller because bitcoin is worth more but you're still only getting the same dollar amount as difficulty increases. the bitcoin you mined on day 1 has gained 50% but all the rest of the bitcoin you mined has has less time to gain.  
  
The alternative is you buy $3000 worth of bitcoin on day 1 and and the year with $4500 worth. As more time passes the gap shrinks because you're still getting free bitcoin from the miner but it is unlikely to exceed the gain of the first bitcoin you bought for $3000 unless the mining difficulty decreases.

for bitcoin to reach $1,000,000 each, it would need to have twice the amount of USD value that gold currently has (~15 trillion?). In order for it to reach that much many of the existing millionaires/billionaires would need to believe that their net worth is better denominated in bitcoin rather than USD. They would still be billionaires  
  
It would represent a shift of power, but it's not like there would be more millionaires/billionaires than before because you can't create value out of nothing.  
  
This could happen if for instance the US government decided to accept bitcoin as an official currency and decided to eventually phase out the dollar. or if the USD collapsed entirely (unlikely but who knows in two years...)

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by fundamentals, the fundamentals of bitcoin haven't really been fully explored yet but I've heard that quantity and fees of on-chain transactions are the fundamental drivers of bitcoin price. Basically a measure of adoption. Exchange volume is good but not a fundamental, more of a byproduct as a lot of exchange volume can be artificial or not really applicable to bitcoin's success/adoption.  
  
Anyway that's besides the point, if the doubling period is getting exponentially smaller it means we will soon be basically going vertical. I mean can you really see bitcoin being worth $1,000,000 (a 100x increase) just 5 months from now? It can't realistically happen. If you look at the estimates for the trend for pre-2016 to present and earlier you will see that the predictions were much more accurate for when we hit 10,000 and I believe will be much more accurate for when we hit $1,000,000 (~2020).
This will require a HUGE drop to occur over the next few months, recovering by mid 2018 or severe stagnation.

So you think that this pool is just exploiting a security breech that affected &lt;100 addresses, the owners of which were notified and probably emptied and is just searching through 200 trillion keys per day for fun?
  


I did, buggy RNG means that the underlying RNG that wallets use to **generate** the keys for is faulty and it's pattern has been exposed, this has not happened yet on a large scale of any kind. This would allow an attacker to search through only **specific private keys** for valid keys, which LBC IS NOT DOING. If the RNG was completely compromised then it would be trivial to get all valid keys from that wallet generator simultaneously. *If LBC was just searching buggy RNG, there would be no need to search through every key.*

It's a brute force attack, looking for ANY private key with BTC on it. They could find Gdax's wallet tomorrow and empty it if they got lucky.

Tether is having a bigger impact than you think, if you research it some more you will see the math behind the bubble. The total amount of Tether is insignificant but the actual impact of Tether is based on 24hr volume which is NOT insignificant compared to Bitcoin's 24hr volume, especially with leverage considered. i.e. BTC price is being moved significantly by Tether.   
  
Hint: Every dollar that BTC price rises by increases the "market cap" of BTC by $16 million because "market cap" is a retarded metric.

When did they solve the traveling salesman problem? This is news to me.
The only way LN is feasible is with a *centralized* hub that connects many users with many merchants with fewest number of hops, one. Like the deformed crypto-child of VISA and a bank, where you open a channel and have access to instant transactions with all the merchants that use that company.  
  
Sounds not too bad for a scaling solution, however it opens the door to evils that we don't want here. Evils that come because consensus rules no longer apply to 2nd layer and the bitcoins aren't "real" until the final settlement. For example, fractional reserve lending would be possible to create in LN.

Do you use credit cards? Do you know that you are paying ~2% more in fees via increased prices for that convenience? You're willing to pay more because you don't want to have to carry cash around.
People value better methods of transaction, not the just the physical goods those transactions are used for. A new invention that improves transactions has a practical use and intrinsic value for everyone who makes transactions.  
  
If I invented teleportation that would enable me to trade goods instantly with china do you think that would have value? It wouldn't produce anything, so to your eyes it wouldn't be worth anything. Let me tell you it would be worth at least as much as the entire shipping industry, but more because it's a *better* method of transacting that people would be willing to pay more for.

@_date: 2017-11-20 15:57:18
That's not how it works, what you are calling "several billion in bitcoin" is actually a multiplication of [Value per bitcoin]x[number of bitcoin traded].  
  
30 million tethers were created a few days ago, which is ~.6% of all bitcoin volume traded that day. .6% higher artificial demand for bitcoin *raises the price of ALL ~16,000,000 bitcoins in existance*, probably by around .6%.  
  
At $8000 per bitcoin that equates to around $50 per bitcoin or about $768 million dollars of fake value rise of "market cap" for a measly $30 million in tethers
  
And that's just ONE day of a Tether market pump at 1:1 leverage, imagine 10:1 or 100:1 leverage and now think that the $30 million tethers are being printed every couple of days (they average $10 million/day Tethers printed)  
  
That's why it's a problem, not because "A couple hundred million in tether cannot buy several billion in bitcoin."  
  
What will happen when people see that half of bitcoin's market cap was created out of thin air when they legitimately thought that bitcoin was worth 136 Billion USD as it stands right now??

There are other currencies out there that  DO have solutions but we aren't any closer to implementing those solutions because certain parties are too busy trying to make bitcoin into a tool that makes THEM profit rather than what it was originally designed for, that is a crypto*currency*
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:24:26
Merchants aren't going to open up lightning channels with just anyone off the street. The design of LN is such that realistically there will only be a few major hubs that will connect merchants with users. Users will open and fund an account (a channel) with the hubs and the hubs will have the resources to reach many merchants, sort of like a combination of a bank and VISA.
The entire purpose of the LN is to act as a 3rd party to siphon transaction fees from the miners while only making a fraction of the capital investment. All reward, no risk. The future owners of the LN hubs will be the new big banks (or old ones) and will be able to make the rules as they see fit because they will no longer be constrained to the consensus rules of the miners on the base layer.  
  
LN does nothing that a properly designed base layer can't already do with the right modifications. So, how to get users to agree with such a scheme?  
  
Oh, right, just place an artificial limit on the base layer of 1MB and claim that it's for decentralization. Once the base layer is rendered impossible to scale then 2nd layer will be the only choice, which conveniently they are developing.

Maybe it's excessive, but the very nature of bitcoin front-ends the coin creation process.

Back when there wasn't really well known recovery methods and bitcoins were worth shit so people weren't very careful about losing them.

The whole reason for Tether to exist is that it has the properties of a cryptocurrency with the value of $1 USD. It's not always possible or easy to trade BTC directly for USD so that's where Tether comes in.  
  
However, at this point it is highly likely that Tether is a scam because the creators refuse independent audits proving that they do indeed hold $1 USD for ever Tether. If It comes out that there is no money behind Tether it will collapse a good chunk of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is so far beyond what a stock is it can't even be compared by any known metrics, even market cap isn't really a real metric for bitcoin. The reason why bitcoin fluctuates so much is because it's a TINY currency compared to all other currencies, it's still in it's infancy. If it reaches maturity it will easily reach the value ("market cap") of other major currencies such as USD, YEN,  EUR.

Also, anyone who was going to buy bitcoin using tether is screwed so now there's less total value available to buy bitcoin. Less buyers = less bitcoin price in USD. Not to mention the panic-selling when people find out.

Reposting for visibility:  
  
30 million tethers released just today, that's ~4% of bitfinex's daily BTC volume ~.55% of total daily BTC volume. Lets just estimate that the addition of .55% additional buying pressure increased the price by .55% since supply is constant. .55% of $7800 is ~$43 per bitcoin price inflation, The market cap of bitcoin is based on price per bitcoin * 16,684,612 BTC = $715 million dollars in increased market cap  
**$30 million USDT = $715 million market cap**  
Holy shit. Now, Imagine if those tethers were used for margin trading 10:1 or 100:1. Now remember that this isn't the first time this has happened.  
If Tether is a scam it will absolutely devastate the market.

Lets say you bought 20 casino chips for $20 with the expectation that you'd later be able to trade chips back to dollars. You also trade/gamble your chips with other people, trade your gold watch for some more chips. Now you have 200 chips, worth $200.
Then it turns out the casino never intended to take chips and give you dollars back, they just sold an ass load of casino chips to people, took the money and ran.
You thought you had $200 in chips but now you have $0 in chips because they are worthless. And you don't have a gold watch anymore because you traded it away for worthless chips. That's a big loss if you were depending on those chips to = $ to pay your bills.

The thing is that it's OK to catch a falling knife if you're alright with the likelihood and potential magnitude of it falling further. If I buy at 3500 (~25% dip) and each dip on average is around 35% I'm OK with the risk of losing an additional 10-20%. The alternative leaves you waiting on the sidelines forever. You still come out ahead of HODLER's that had the chance to sell at 4500 and didn't, or noobs that bought at 5000. You don't have to get in at the bottom to make a profit.

No the transitions are driven by regulation. Why don't merchants accept gold? It has value. They don't because it's just easier to take the same money that the banks take. Path of least resistance and all. Bitcoin won't disappear overnight, but history shows it will probably never be adopted by the majority before the banks switch to a fiat crypto system and then merchants who do accept bitcoin will disappear along with it's value.  
  
Why do merchants use bitcoin now? Probably because it's not taxed by the IRS yet. That's not that far away. There is literally no other reason for a business to accept bitcoin other than "good feelings", which doesn't apply to big business. Businesses will jump through lots of hoops to avoid taxes, they do it all the time. Once that gap is closed by regulation bitcoin's days will be numbered.

Miners are backing out left and right, they might split but it would be suicide. The original bitcoin would be worthless without miners enabling transactions and the fork would be worthless without users.      
Case in point: Bitcoin Cash is doing OK but the price is 8x lower than bitcoin and they HAVE some user support.   
  
There is almost no user support for the miner fork, the price would be far lower than Bitcoin Cash, but with all the difficulty that comes with all that hashpower, it would be FAR less profitable to mine than the original bitcoin. Mining profits basically follow the formula = price/difficulty. So in order for the miners coin to be more profitable, they would need to NOT mine their own coin. It's a paradox that can't exist.  
  
Bitcoin Cash "succeeded" because they had a relatively equal amount of users and miners that wanted to split so that the profitability found an equilibrium with price and difficulty.

I need to do some research on how they moved away from coins to paper dollars. History repeats itself. I'm assuming they offered equal-value trade ins.
The value would be arbitrary, just like our existing dollars, probably 1:1

Nothing 'backs' bitcoin other than people using it. If everyone stopped using bitcoin it would be worthless. Even the flimsy fiat of $USD is backed by more than bitcoin because they force you to use it with laws that are enforced by men with guns.

I respect it. But at this phase it's probably only at the DARPA "think tank" stage. Most policy makers don't know what bitcoin is, or that they could corrupt it for their own purposes. But once they do learn, make no mistake, they will make a fiat system of their own. There is a reason why they moved us away from the gold standard.

Yeah I went half in on a gut instinct that this is an intermediate low with the chance of being a long-term low. The other half is going in once I get the official "buy signal" from my charts.  
  
Of course only a portion of it is going to bitcoin, I'm diversifying between Tier 1 (the big 3), Tier 2 (smaller coins that have proven themselves), and Tier 3 (experimental/ICO)

Are you saying that exchanges losing millions of dollars and potentially going bankrupt won't hurt the price of BTC? Are you saying that in the uncertainty of the exchanges financial health we won't see a mad rush for the exits  on exchanges as people try to prevent getting their balances lost?  
  
None of that would create enough uncertainty to create selling pressure that wouldn't be able to be filled on potentially crippled exchanges?

Well, First you need a company to set up a LN Hub that people trust to transact money, Bob and Starbucks both set up a channel with a Hub we'll call BofA, .They both fund their accounts, oops i mean channels, with bitcoins that they want to transact with frequently. Then when Bob wants to send a transaction to Starbucks he can instantly buy his coffee because both Bob and Starbucks trust the LN hub BofA.  
  
Don't worry, IT'S COMPLETELY DECENTRALIZED because bob could set up a LN network with every vendor on earth separately if he wanted.

The thing is that it's OK to catch a falling knife if you're alright with the likelihood and potential magnitude of it falling further. If I buy at 3500 (~25% dip) and each dip on average is around 35% I'm OK with the risk of losing an additional 10-20%. The alternative leaves you waiting on the sidelines forever. You still come out ahead of HODLER's that had the chance to sell at 4500 and didn't, or noobs that bought at 5000. You don't have to get in at the bottom to make a profit.
Would you say that he people who bought stocks in late 2008 were wrong for catching a falling knife given that the market reached it's bottom in early 2009? They definitely came out ahead.

Once everyone's on LN (because high fees on-chain) it won't matter, they can modify it as they want without a fork. I guarantee big banks will open lightning hubs because that's what the vendors will want, similar to how they accept VISA. Us ever-day Joe Shmoes will have to create an account (read: open a channel) with the banks to make transactions at all those vendors.

Its not anonymous once you tie your ID to a wallet like most users have. Merchants would be too scared to use it if the fed came down.  
Without users, exchanges, and merchants bitcoin would be "gone". It wouldn't actually be gone, just pushed to the black market fringe where it would live out its days as a novelty used to buy LSD on silkroad. It's value would be irrelevant to the majority of the world.
Is it going to happen? Probably not, but we are not safe and to think otherwise is foolish.

The hard part is getting your customers to pay in a weird currency that they have no clue how to get. They have a $20 bill in their hand that they got when they cashed their paycheck, and want to get high tonight.  
  
The gap exists for bitcoin as well, just replace "get high tonight" with "get X tonight" and it still works. People would use it if only it was easy to transfer between dollars and coins without waiting on bank transfers, exchange limitations/verification, or sky high prices on localbitcoins and bitcoin ATM's

The Ipad is a bad example, we had user-friendly internet in the early 2000's, around 7 years. It also took around 7 years from the beginnings of popular smartphones to the Iphone.  
  
I'd say we are at most 1-2 years away from the Iphone of bitcoin. In order for bitcoin to ultimately succeed we need a bitcoin wallet that is as intuitive and functional as going into your local JP Morgan bank branch. With instant and cheap transactions on a debit card that can be swiped at any merchant. Making transactions with a wallet address is like writing a check, cumbersome. It's something that should only RARELY if ever need to be done.  
  
Wallets today are getting better and better. It won't take too long now, I'd say that bitcoin is RIPE for the picking.

 Can answer most of your questions. The key thing is that the reason people and exchanges use tether is because it has the utility of a cryptocurrency (transfers, divisibility) with the fixed value of 1 USD = 1 USDT. Currently most of the tether is on the exchanges in one way or another.
Here's how it works (simplified example):  
1. Bob sends $100 USD to kraken.  
2. Bob exchanges $100 USD to 100 USDT through Kraken. Kraken gives bob's $100 USD to Tether and recieves the 100 USDT that it then credits in Bob's account. He can now transfer that money to other exchanges or his own wallet for storage easier, he no longer has to go through a bank, YAY Bob!    
4. Now Bob does something with his USDT, No one buys USDT just to have it sit around. So he buys BTC with USDT, transfers the USDT to his wallet, or to Poloniex. Most people are probably buying BTC, using leverage I might add. Bob buys $200 worth of BTC (0.04522 at the moment).  
5. Kraken now has Bob's USDT back, They can exchange it back to Tether for 1:1 USD using a bank transfer that's slow and painful. OR hold onto it in the event that other users need some USDT or if Bob decides to cash out his wicked 1000% gains (he's not much of a hodler)
  
&lt;- WE ARE HERE
  
So, Lets start start a hypothetical situation, obviously I have no proof of this, no one does. The silence of Tether speaks for itself IMO though.  
  
6) The owners/shareholders in Tether secretly pocket the $100,000,000 USD.  
7) Kraken is kind of nervous, the $100,000,000 USDT they have in reserve is a lot of money, so they ask Tether for an independent 3rd party audit so they KNOW the money is still there in reserve.  
8) Tether says "Audit is all good, the money is all there, but we aren't going to show you the audit. See it says on our website right here -&gt;  
9) Kraken is pissed, but can't exactly trade back the tether because users are trading with it, after all Kraken told it's users it would buy and sell tether for 1 USD each.  
  
  
At some point, when exchanges figure out they can no longer trade back the Tether to USD the truth comes out. The money is long gone. USDT heads to $0. The $100,000,000 that Kraken thought it was holding is worth $0. Including Bob who had just cashed out his 1000% gains, of .5 BTC into 2199 USDT he freaks out and tries to withdraw everything he can into his own personal wallet, along with 1000's of other users. But Kraken is broke, they can't afford to keep the servers running and pay back everyone they BTC/USD in their Kraken accounts so they immediately lock all transfers. Kraken Bob and the rest of Kraken's users are now screwed because really Kraken is the one who possessed all that USDT and BTC. So even if Bob hadn't cashed out his BTC it still would have been seized by Kraken. After all, not your keys, not your bitcoin!  
  


  
This is backwards, if USDT is losing value, BTC/USDT is *falling* and USDT/BTC will *rise*. After all, why would you pay MORE bitcoin for an asset that's losing value?? The truth is anyone with USDT will be trying to SELL SELL SELL but no one will buy, and the price -&gt; $0, 0 BTC. Thinking about it another way, if it's worth $.01 USD, why would you pay more bitcoin than $.01 USD is worth? $.01 USD is worth .00000226 BTC so that would be the price of 1 tether if 1 tether is $.01 USD  
  
Now Kraken is gone, and 1000's of people lost their bitcoins and money, hundreds of millions, probably more (remember Bob was 2x leveraged!). What happens to the value of BTC? Everyone thought the market cap of Bitcoin was $72 billion, but a bunch of that was monopoly money. What sane average american would be like "I know 4 people who just lost $10,000 with no legal repercussion so YEAH, i'm going to go out  right now and buy some bitcoin!" after all this? Which vendors would allow customers to use bitcoin? It will be Mt.Gox all over again, but 10 times worse, Kraken alone trades $30 million worth of bitcoin in  just 24hr, all gone. Now add Poloniex, bitfinex, bittrex..... It could be bad, really bad.  
  
  
Right now, this is the only thing preventing the scenario above:  
  
"Audit is all good, the money is all there, but we aren't going to show you the audit. See it says on our website right here -&gt;

Very naive. Do you really think coinbase and all the other exchanges with KYC and AML won't turn everyone's ID over to the feds like a bitch?
The block chain is 100% transparent so all it takes is one big exchange to break and they can track everything their users do. The algorithms already exist to do so.  Plus they can simply enact legislation to require ID for any sale to fiat, then tax you for the full asset amount by assuming your cost basis was $0.
  
Unless someone solely uses local Bitcoins, cold storage, and never plans to sell for fiat they are the ones who will need "good luck" once the IRS gets involved. The exchanges sealed our fate long ago
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:54:24
Yes, the lightning network will increase capacity by acting like VISA debit card with your bank. You will put your BTC on an account with a big hub that's accepted at a large number of vendors which allows you to transact instantly with those vendors. The hub then takes a cut of the transaction. The on-chain block size needs to be kept small, with high fees and slow transactions so that people will use this new network. The corrupt miners should not get as much profit as they do so the LN allows other people to take a cut of the transaction fees without needing to buy all that expensive mining equipment.

Even your own link says that the cause of the largest increases in inflation are due to monetary policy and money supply. I'll admit that smaller, temporary increases can be due to supply and demand of a MAJOR resource like oil that affects the entire economy via gas prices, or a MAJOR disaster, but that doesn't apply to most economic activity throughout history. The reason why your grandpa could buy a coke for a nickle and it costs you a dollar is not because demand for coke has increased so much or that coke supply has decreased. It's because your dollar is now worth that much less because there are [SO MANY more dollars in existence.](  
  
The point is, that people feel their buying power constantly decreasing (heard any crying about minimum wage recently?) and will be naturally driven to an asset that doesn't ALWAYS lose value like fiat dollars/euro/etc.  
  
Even if bitcoin doesn't gain ANY real world value over the next 15 years, it's value in dollars will go up because dollars will always be worth less and less each year.

My favorite comment from this article:


  
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:16:36
There are two main problems with games using currencies that can be directly moved to real world currencies. Diablo 3 was a good example of the problems, and they eventually removed the ability to convert in-game gold to USD.  
  
1) It creates a conflict of interest. As a player, do I spend my gold on item upgrades or cash it out? Real world money gains usually trump in-game items so the net flows of currency is away from the game. You have to design intelligent money sinks that don't drive the players away but also keeps the currency circulating in-game  
  
2) Abuse. In diablo 3, once people learned that you could make a lot of money by converting in-game items to USD, the Chinese gold farmers and bots came out in force. For every account banned, 10 more took its place. The economy was being devestated and they were simply cashing out all the money that players were willing to sink into the game. Eventually, only the wealthiest (in real life) players could afford to buy the best items and normal players could only afford scraps. The botters controlled the market because they had an easy gold supply and only wanted USD.

You'd just need to report your gains to the IRS like everyone else.  
  
The banks flag large transactions and have algorithms that flag regular transactions that are near the flag limit (if it looks like you are avoiding it purposely). It's 100x more suspicious to attempt to get around the flag than it is to just do it all at once. The flag isn't "bad" it just means they notify the IRS, not that you will get audited.  
  
Sell what you want when you want, pay taxes and you will be fine. Don't do that and you will get in trouble when they catch you.
