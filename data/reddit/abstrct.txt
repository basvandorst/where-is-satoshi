The CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium is a registered non-profit in Canada. Incredible amounts of work put into it this project in the form of legal details, business planning, site design and of course the actual examination and peer review processes. Many of the names listed on the site as advisors have publicly stated their support as well.
I appreciate that scams are everywhere and it has to be asked but no, this is not a scam. This is an organization that has been in the works for about a year for the betterment of Bitcoin and the future of cryptocurrencies.  
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:17:40
C4 is a non-profit organization with directors and advisors who are well known in the cryptocurrency space. There are costs involved with certifying but that's because there are costs involved in running a certification authority. 
You can find more information here: 
If I need a lawyer or accountant for my Bitcoin business, I want them to know what I'm talking about, otherwise their advice will probably be wrong. If I am hiring somebody, this makes things a lot easier to gauge what level they are at and how much I will need to teach them before they are useful in my business. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:08:51
Sorry, we must be taking up a lot of useful Apple Pay advertising space :/ 
As a new organization that just launched less than a month ago, we are definitely in a push to announce to the community who we are and what we offer, as well as get valuable feedback so we can continue to improve. The community is a key point of that push because there are a lot of valuable members of the cryptocurrency community that spend their time here. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:26:14
C4 is just a certification body and doesn't perform the training. This allows for many organizations to offer training while still assuring a standard level upon completion.   
While I generally believe in not feeding the trolls, I think this is actually a relevant question. People who are able to complete the CBP will be less prone to falling for scams as they have shown they have an understanding of how Bitcoin works, what portions are sensitive, and what organizations are actually involved in the Bitcoin space.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:28:43
C4 has literally hundreds (if not thousands) of hours put into the organization to make it what it is today. The volume of traffic to the forms doesn't really make a good metric as to the cost of the certification. C4 is a non-profit so this isn't about lining wallets - it's about giving your classic business comfort during their hiring process using means they are familiar with. 
Our CBP exam intentionally has a very tight timeframe that it must be completed within to make cheating quite difficult. It is even barely enough time when you know the answers - searching may get you one or two answers but it won't get you a pass. 
If you don't see a purpose in certification than this really isn't design for you and that's ok. We have many organizations who are looking to hire people across several industries and they have shown their support and excitement for this project. They are thrilled to have an easy metric to judge that people have basic knowledge of Bitcoin. 
It is also important to point out that this is just the CBP, another exam is coming soon which is a much more in-depth technical exam. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:43:33
That's a great question and it kind of goes along with "what gives bitcoin value?" - In short, it's trust. 
We have worked very hard to create a test that was developed by a very strong diverse committee and was further peer reviewed by a number of large names in the industry. We started this out of our own need (I was trying to hire people and it was terrible) and we realized that others had the same need. Sure, there is a question of why trust us, and that is totally fair. But we are providing a service that we felt was needed in the space, and we are doing so completely as a not-for-profit. 
If you want to learn more about how the test was developed, you can read our other post here: 
As for who recognizes us, there is certainly people in the industry who think highly of the designation and look for it when hiring. We are only a couple months old though so this is still growing. I have yet to hear of anybody who didn't see value in the test after trying it. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:55:38
Fair enough, I can understand that criticism. For the record, this is actually the first time any of the directors have posted something about it to reddit. All of the other posts have been from supporters. But the optics may seem otherwise.

@_date: 2014-09-16 19:33:41
Amazing feedback, thanks so much for taking the time to post. This is the first I have heard about the issues you faced within the testing application but that sounds really frustrating. We will do some tests on our end to try and recreate the problem and then do our best to have it resolved. 
Updating a resume doesn't cost anything extra but that may not be clear in the current workflow. We will look into smoothing that out a bit as well from an interface perspective. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:40:46
I am very proud to say that most of the C4 posts have been by members of the community excited about what we are doing. Officially, there is one post by myself (posting an article that somebody else wrote about C4) and now one post by TigereyeTO posting the C4 press release.
This isn't advertising. This is community involvement. Thanks for your input though.

@_date: 2014-09-10 15:40:54
We would still like to you submit a resume/CV/whatever your local custom, even if it is very simple. Differences from language and cultural perspectives is something we are totally understanding of - at worst we may just want to have a quick conversation with you. 
This is done so that we can assure that the people we certify are real people and also so that they get the most out of being a CBP - from job opportunities in their field, to alerts on local events and groups. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:31:06
We only accept Bitcoin as payment. Consider it the first step in assuring that you understand Bitcoin. 
The length of the certification was actually something we put a lot of thought into. We decided on two years because the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency space is very new and very fast moving. We want to make sure that certified professionals are up to date in their knowledge and not missing out on the details of key changes that occur. This is certainly something we will revisit as Bitcoin matures. 
Edit: I should say that we only *currently* accept Bitcoin. As we develop our certifications across other cryptocurrencies, our support for payment will expand to include these currencies too. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:52:48
Thanks! Happy to add more if anybody has additional resources they think fit.

Lawyers are easy to poke fun at, and some honestly are not that nice of people (what industry doesn't have assholes?), but I have worked with enough to know that a passionate lawyer on your side is an incredible thing. 
Lawyers, and other professionals, who want to understand Bitcoin enough for a certification are on our side and have probably put more effort into helping Bitcoin as a whole than many of us in the space. Maybe we should hold off on the burning and such for a bit...

Hmm interesting, apparently this is a game of Feature or Bug! Thanks for adding in your experience too. As with all debugging, any additional details are always helpful. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:44:19
Honestly, it seems silly but we have processes and procedures in place to detect and deal with such a situation too. I'm not saying it won't happen and cheating isn't a concern - quite the opposite. It is a concern and it is something we take very seriously. 
If you research the background of the Board of Directors, you will find a couple who have a career of securing information systems, performing investigations, and also have strong ties to the legal community. We will work very hard to set a standard and assure that those who proudly display the designations we certify do deserve them.

I like to think we are awesome but I'm a bit biased as a director of the organization. Happy to answer any questions you have. 
Edit: Actually no, we aren't awesome **yet**. But we are working really hard to be awesome one day soon. We have a great team of people who feel that a non-profit organization dedicated to standards is important to helping Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies succeed. We think the CBP is great and we are really proud of it but it is just the beginning of what C4 will work to accomplish in the coming months.

I found out about it now four.. maybe five years ago? Thought it was ridiculous until I spent a month trying to break it (I have an information security background). Through my attempts to break it, I learned what a beautiful system it truly is. 
I mined, and I made a lot of coin. I sold that coin to upgrade to the next generation. 
Butterly Labs didn't ship! What a unique story that is. Now I have less coin :(
Understood early on that mining, although important isn't everything. It is just one of those key steps that everyone must attempt. 
From there, I just tried to apply my other interests and knowledge to cryptocurrencies. 
1. Started a security consulting firm and worked with amazing organizations like ethereum and numerous exchanges
2. Give talks to lawyers and accountants even when they think I'm insane
3. Made a skill based blockchain game for the DEF CON security conference (bitcoin version coming soon!)
4. Started the C4 non-profit because I care about cryptocurrencies and I think it will help adoption
5. Give more talks to those same lawyers who now wish I had been more insane
Honestly it's been an awesome journey and I look forward to more crazy adventures. I don't travel anywhere without meeting the local bitcoin community (I'm looking at you Vegas, Tokyo, and Osaka) and I try not to miss local meetups (Decentral in Toronto is an incredible community).
My story isn't about riches and, in reality, has been a lot of work. Days and days of having 2, 4, and 4 different jobs. But what a ride, what awesome challenges I have had the privilege to attack, and oh man, what a future I look forward to. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:57:12
I think you are right here. I will bring this up with the CBP committee and see if this topic is properly covered. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:55:01
Do you have a particular concern that makes you think this is a scam? I am happy to answer any questions you have.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:48:25
There is no question worded as "Which of the below is a scam?" but there are questions that, as two quick examples, test your knowledge of "official" organizations and understanding of addresses and privates keys. Again, this isn't directly teaching people how to recognize scams, but is assuring that they have the knowledge of Bitcoin needed to make educated discussions in their day to day activities. 
With that being said, if this doesn't sound like enough and you have additional ideas on how we can improve on this, please get in touch with us: info 
From the absolute beginning, the most important thing for us was that our exams were built and reviewed with the help of our peers. If you want to help us improve on our exams, we welcome and encourage such participation.

You have 20 minutes to complete the exam. 
Absolutely we plan on giving student discounts, especially to those involved in cryptocurrency groups at their schools. We just haven't figured out the exact logistics behind that yet.

My bad. It was my original inquiry to Mint and I just received their official response. I didn't expect that I was the last to know.
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:12:47
It is on our roadmap to become ISO 17024 certified, which is an international standard for Certification Bodies. Amusingly enough though, the first requirement of that standard is that the organization must be actively certifying professionals before the audit process can begin. 
There is certainly a bit of chicken or the egg type situation here that we are dealing with. Most organizations want to see us walk before they will help us run.
Despite not having buy in from many financial industry groups (yet), we have reached out to many well respected folks in the Bitcoin space for their feedback and support and, honestly, there has been an incredible response. This organization isn't just a couple randoms deciding they are the experts on the subject matter, it has been a community effort.
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:54:34
The CBP is a multiple choice exam. We have worked pretty hard to assure that this still tests a certain level of understanding and there is a pretty tight timeline on the exam to prevent rampant googling of the answers. This format of the exam was done so that we could reach a wider audience. Having testing centres globally available for something more substantial would have made the price point of such an exam way too high for what it is trying to accomplish. On a light note, there is some hands on knowledge that one still has to show as you can only pay C4 using bitcoin. 
Our Certified Bitcoin Expert exam will be an in-person proctored test that will be much more like what you have described. A very in-depth exam with various formats of questions and scenarios.

Let's remove the theme of 'private blockchain' for a second and just take a look at the technology he is suggesting. He is proposing an enterprise system that ties into the blockchain, maintain the ledger for other internal enterprise applications, and providing a means for those enterprise applications to queue up transactions into the bitcoin ecosystem. 
I'm sure a number of organizations have written ingestion engines, signers and broadcasters to give themselves a powerful bitcoin backend in a more familiar format that their applications can interact with. Extending postgres, an incredible piece of software trusted in countless organizations, to incorporate the blockchain, perform validation and coordinate sends would immediately replace all these, still well performing, band-aid scripts we have running around postgres already.
PostgreSQL's feature list, of which this is just a portion of, includes:
* Foreign Data Wrappers
* Background Workers
* JSON / JSONB support
* Advanced indexing
* Fine grained security and auditing
* Licensed similar to the BSD license
Business applications really like talking SQL to each other. Imagine if the n-million cloud hosted postgresql databases had bitcoin support built-in? I think this would be a great puzzle piece to fit into the enterprise and improve adoption.

C4 was just there to show support. Deloitte and C4 have worked together on a number of initiatives (like the CCSS) and we think it's great that there is a BTM in the heart of the Toronto financial district, branded with a familiar name. The BTM was all Deloitte's internal blockchain team.
Additionally, C4 doesn't have any employees on payroll. We are volunteer run.
@_date: 2016-09-07 12:56:42
According to the speech given, it was up on a different floor for the launch to support a slightly larger crowd, but it will make it down to the lobby soon for public access. It will also travel around to conferences, which is equally exciting given the diversity in events an organization like Deloitte is a part of. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 06:57:35
Too bad they don't actually reference any cryptocurrency specific requirements. This is basically just a list of common practices for infosec, which is important, but misses the point.
Businesses who, in addition to proper cyber security practices, try to self-regulate through CCSS compliance will have a much stronger system.
@_date: 2016-09-07 18:26:47
You're right, you didn't say they were anti-bitcoin. I apologize.
For what it's worth, they did say the BTM would be available in a public space but I know that limits will be low. Large institutions are very difficult to move though so I think the BTM project deserves more credit then you would expect. 
I think you hit the nail on the head though, it's not a move to entice the highly technical, but the financial district is not about high-tech, we are generally outnumbered here ;) 
@_date: 2016-09-07 16:20:15
While I don't completely disagree, I also don't believe it is a totally fair portrayal. Deloitte DOES really like dApps/ethereum, but they are not anti-bitcoin by any means. 
A new BTM can seem like a small step. We have had BTMs for years after all. But just imagine how many people internally were involved for Deloitte to have a BTM. You name a department and I bet they were involved - Legal, Compliance, Risk, IT - Risk, IT - Networking, Marketing, Operations, Site Management. A group at Deloitte had to care a LOT to pull this off - and they had to convince a lot of people internally that Bitcoin is important in the process. 
Is it a marketing stunt? Absolutely. It's a marketing stunt to get their clients, a.k.a. all of the financial district, asking about this Bitcoin thing. They want to be the ones that these clients finally ask when they work up the courage to learn more. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:53:13
Standards and centralization are not the same thing. The standards help everyone - At minimum, new groups with a great idea now have  somewhere to look for advice on creating a secure product.

Gem has been a huge contributor here and other individuals have also shown their support. 
I don't really expect this post to get anywhere towards the top but we really appreciate those who have supported us to date. 
If you don't know what C4 is, a year ago we started an non-propfit organization to focus on standardizing the cryptocurrency space. We started with personnel certifications and recently released a security standard that has a lot of the industry on board. Support goes directly to funding these initiatives.

Your idea that no security professional uses Word, PDF and Excel is flawed but sure, let's assume it was a bad call on our part. If we take down the zip can we focus on making the standard something helpful for the industry?
Edit: sorry, re-read it and noticed the suggestion. Consider it done. 
Edit: done

You're right, I do certainly over simplify it. Identify and reputation are really difficult problems to solve. I just don't see proof of burn as a sustainable solution to the problem.
That's just my opinion though. If you have something that people like and the results are relatively successful then that's great. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:47:30
I honestly just wish that people would attack the draft with the same passion that they attack my person. It would be so much more constructive. 
I suppose I'm too candid on Reddit as it's not somewhere I needed to be professional prior to C4 (my history should make that obvious). I will do what I can to be more professional in this sub going forward.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:22:29
It's still a draft at this point but a number of organizations, including exchanges, are contributing and looking to meet all the requirements once the first version is finalized. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 17:46:44
We look forward to your feedback! 
In our next phase we also need to start putting together common processes and procedures that auditors can use when assessing against the standard. The more firms we have working together on this the better it will be. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:41:01
We actually strongly suggest that people review and contribute to the standard through our git repository which, as you request, is completely HTML based and allows for a more open discussion of the draft:  
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:17:49
Good suggestion, thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:38:41
Thanks for the feedback! These are some great points. I think we have some covered already but we will take a more detailed look and see how/where they can fit. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:28:29
A section on secure communication would be a strong addition to the standard. We had it in at an earlier revision but there was an equally strong argument that, from a customer perspective, the industry wasn't ready for it. 
Regardless, I hope that I soon see the secure communication section proposed and discussed publicly in more depth within the repository. It would make sense to at least start with a section mandating internal communications are being signed and/or encrypted. 
As for the CISSP, the curriculum is extremely detailed and covers the information security industry very well. I'm sure the difficult part that ISC2 deals with every day is making sure that the test confidently assess an individual against that curriculum. All and all I would say that ISC2 has done an incredible job maintaining that bar - it isn't an easy task. There has been ups and downs in the quality at times but they clearly recognize that and have worked keep the standard high. 
It's also important to remember that the CISSP existed long before degrees and diplomas in the information security space were available, which could mean that it's usefulness has declined somewhat - but a common bar does still benefit hiring managers.
Personally, I don't have my CISSP, but I know a number of qualified professionals that proudly display it behind their name. I know an equal amount of organizations who require it from new recruits, as they have found it to be a consistent measuring stick. 
 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:34:47
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:00:11
A next step in the process is outlining the processes/procedures an auditor can follow to assess against the standard. I think proof of reserve will definitely be a topic that sees a lot of debate - it will be a difficult part to solve confidently but it's worth the effort to try.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:23:06
The document is for the public to use, learn from and evolve. As we expect there to be community involvement in the authoring of the standard, it is only right that the license governing the repository reflect that. 
With that being said, there will be licensing costs and procedures involved in order to publicly declare compliance with the CryptoCurrency Security Standard and to use our marks. This is for a number of reasons, not limited to consumer protection, our own liability, and of course to help fund the continued maintenance of the standard.
If another organization/individual feels the need to fork our standard, we wish them all the best but we would certainly rather work together instead. *Many* competing organizations put time into writing the draft so there isn't really a concern that we can't continue to work together now that this is public. If there is a glaring omission or hinderance to innovation, we would take such a problem quite seriously and happily work to get it resolved. 
There has been a lot of comparison to PCI since our launch, which is understandable, but it is a really tough question to answer - so I am going to answer around it instead like a jerk. This standard was written because we are security professionals and we hoped it would help. We wanted to help consumers (including ourselves!) be able to trust the services they are using. We wanted organizations to share their best practices, because their competitor being hacked *doesn't* help them, it makes us all look silly. We also really wanted something where a new startup or established business could reference from the beginning of any new project, helping them to bake security into their product from day one and save huge amounts backtracking later on in their development cycle. We even wanted organizations to have something to bring to their insurance broker and say "Hey! Look, we are working really hard to secure our service and the industry agrees with us". 
Those are our goals. Does that make us the PCI of Bitcoin? I'm honestly not sure - that depends on your view of PCI.

C4 is a nonprofit that is just focused on developing and maintaining the standards. The standard itself is open and available for all to use in their own assessments. 
Displaying our marks will certainly have requirements and conditions but that shouldn't stop an organization from using this standard internally to better their business.

Proof of Burn is so silly. Why support a system that automatically benefits those with the most to spare? 
If I burned a $1USD bill, would you trust what I have to say or think I'm an idiot? If I burned $100 would that make you more inclined to trust me? 
Develop a reputation system where the money is at least sent to known charities and causes, then I'm all for it. 
Edit: Sorry, this ended up more negative than my usual posts. Nice implementation, I just don't believe in the methodology.

We didn't feel that a lighthouse project was really the place to outline our entire business plan but I appreciate the criticism. We tried to provide specifics while not boring the hell out of everyone. 
You do bring up a good point though, we have a code of ethics for our certified professionals but we haven't updated that to specifically include supporters and other affiliated organizations too. We will definitely get that resolved.

What if you run SD and you want to travel to the USA? Better hope they know any business you operate doesn't violate any of their laws, otherwise you won't have a pleasant time at the airport.

Neat! It is nice to see my suggestion is still gaining a bit of traction. Sometimes these things take time :)

In other news, BFL announces that they have begun production and will totally be shipping next week.

Maybe the website's creator enjoys being able to travel freely to and from the US?

Those monkeys in suits are paid good money to research topics like this on your behalf and do their best to suggest ways of operating within the law. Lawyers get a bad rap, and many times this is justified, but I would guess that any lawyer working on bitcoin related projects is having a blast and actually working really hard to give the best advice.
(I'm not a lawyer but I work with many of them)

Maybe just considering it for the swag booth? He seems concerned about time and the DEFCON reg line is an impressive beast that they work really hard at to keep efficient. 
I think this was bound to happen eventually but I am not sure if this will be the year for it. The conference is only a week away after all.

That's the point of the article. He did put his mind to it. 
Dan if you're around, please feel free to correct this. 
Purely speculation but I know it was on my mind during the timeframe. The last two years, the price has jumped mid-august after the two main hacker conferences, DEFCON and Blackhat. Both years, nobody has destroyed Bitcoin. As Dan points out, it's a big target and this is when somebody would generally show off and make it their bitch. It hasn't happened. Bitcoin is the brunt of a lot of jokes at these conferences, but nobody has broken it and I believe that is saying a lot. 
Take from this what you will, but it is certainly a sign in the right direction for the future of the currency from a security perspective. A wonderful design and a solid implementation using trusted algorithms and libraries.

A full trusted transaction does take 50 minutes. I think saying that a zero confirmation transaction can be trusted for most businesses is a dangerous lie to spread. 
As merchants come on board, we need to make sure they have the best possible information. Misleading them on simple issues like this is going to hurt the currency in the long run. 
The sad part here is that 50 minutes is still quite reasonable in a lot of cases. Practices just need to be altered a bit. Coffee shops usually have payment card systems already which allow for larger less frequent bitcoin transactions to 'fill up', online merchants can easily wait an hour before shipping your product, and, if you eat at a restaurant, you can request to pay in bitcoin while ordering dessert.

NSA *really* doesn't need mints help. Mint is more like an Internet-Mom complaining whenever I use my debit card somewhere dumb or spend too much on booze during consecutive bar nights. 
Really thought, being able to watch my net worth each month has really helped me to save money. It makes it into a bit of a game/challenge where you win your own money. I 'lose' that game by investing in bitcoin though as that money is currently considered gone as far as Mint is concerned.
