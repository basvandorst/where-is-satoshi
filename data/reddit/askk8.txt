I’m just curious if the ones saying ”all altcoins is a scam” that u believed in so much you had to make a post about it acctually presented any facts of this statement being true...
Bitcoin has the longest track record and the most hashpower wich makes it the most ”secure” you could say, but that doesn’t mean that an altcoin like Litecoin is a scam
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:37:45
Did they present any proof of their claims?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:56:30

A marketplace like amazon with the option to pay with cryptocurrencies would be great, where the marketplace is the one verifying that the seller is legit.
There is still scams occuring on amazob despite them being the middleman. So it’s really hard to get around scammers.

You can use it anywhere in the world if the counterparty accepts it. Just like any fiat money..
There’s no private company printing more of as the US dollar, you allways know the current supply of bitcoin no hush hush.
It’s decentralized, no one but you controls your bitcoin own your private key.

That a peer to peer transaction should not take 7+ hours?
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:58:33
That’s atleast what they have been saying all along, clearly all lies��
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:37:48
So you’re saying the goal isn’t a peer to peer electronic cash system anymore?
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:26:59
Nope but that is not peer to peer either
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:29:55
This post literally shows that it took 7+ hours...
I’m pretty sure you haven’t even used LN yourself and you’re just promoting something u know nothing about...��
Please stop promoting stuff that is under development...

”Tether previously said the coin was 100% backed by an equal number of U.S. dollars in reserve. In December, Bloomberg vouched that Tether essentially had a dollar for every USDT on the market, after reviewing parts of its financial auditing records suggesting it had billions in fiat in offshore accounts.”
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:57:18
Why do blockstream keep supporting Tether and bitfinex when they clearly lied about the 1 to 1 backing?
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:40:12
Yea when they got caught red handed��
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:11:39
So what your saying is that couse they said this 1 month ago it’s fine they lied to everyone prior to this? For years?
”Tether previously said the coin was 100% backed by an equal number of U.S. dollars in reserve.

@_date: 2019-05-01 20:13:35
For that you use fiat right?��

So you’re suggesting me to open a LN channel , deposit 10dollar worth of btc, connect to other.
Then help the one i want to send the 10dollar to open a channel, deposit btc as he aswell need cash in the channel te recieve my payment, and then struggle with the withdrawal...
And i didnt even say anything about the fees along the way...

Please dont bring up something thats not ready to be used...

Hopefully this wasn't in a store, and you stood there in 7+ hours waiting for the transaction to go through :)
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:44:02
Nope hell no,  at the moment i would suggest u to use another cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:35:12
What it needs to be is a peer to peer electronic cash system, something people can trust and use without intermediaries as people can’t trust the banks who control their funds...
And if you don’t think this is what it ”needs to be” you and the rest who think alike should fork of and leave the ticker BTC alone for the people who believe in this vision and goal��
