Magnificent find

Ah thanks, I thought there was a check when the block is verified. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:58:30
I seem to recall there is a limit on the number of free transactions allowed per block? Can anyone confirm?

Is there a bitcoin remittance service that can deposit to bank accounts in Vietnam and beat traditional services? I just sent a payment for my girlfriend using Orbit Remit. 
Obviously after spouting the benefits of Bitcoin to her I looked for Bitcoin services first and all I could find was Bitcoin Vietnam and the numbers worked out worse if I assumed already owning some BTC and using bitstamp price. 
*edit: I will say Orbit Remit worked out at a better price than Western Union so I was happy that we didn't have to use WU at least. 
Also Western Union "was down" when we went to the local agent first. And their online service said it wasn't available for some reason also.

There is a small local exchange in NZ - bitnz.com, but there's not a lot on the order book if you want to do a big buy/sell.

Ok if we are being pedantic the guy was wrong about the ponzi scheme thing. Can we move on? The point is that Mt Gox was operating in a manner that was not good for their customers, and it was not the fault of bitcoin itself but the actions of a company.
*edit double negative

Taking payments to pay others. I'm not an expert on Ponzi schemes, but it sounds similar.

Er wouldn't you be saving money then?
0.1415 x 715 NZD = 101.17 NZD, instead of 109 NZD

Start your bitcoin business in New Zealand instead of Australia :)
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has already stated "digital currencies will become more realistic substitutes for cash".

Thanks for your reply, really appreciate it. These calculations are what I went though also. The amount was 400 NZD so just above your threshold for Bitcoin services to be cheaper. 
I tell my gf that one day we will have a worldwide currency with instant transfer and no need to convert it, but seems like there's a bit longer to wait if we need to convert back to fiat. 
I did ask her about Circle and credit card deposits but she said they don't really use credit card in VN. Haven't done the calculations there. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:42:16
Yep that's where I got all my bitcoins. Though it would always show in my account next business day when I made deposits at the bank, but haven't made a deposit recently. 
I preferred it because it didn't require any international money transfers.

Doesn't work on Alien Blue, for me anyway. Always have to search the comments for the time.

I've tried it, looks good! But I found it is only showing 15 of my receiving addresses, so the total balance is incorrect.  I have 5 more addresses with balances in them which aren't listed.
Also it seems like it doesn't check change addresses at all, so balances in there are not included in the total.
Edit: I see there is a slider in the settings to set the number of addresses to retrieve.  Can this be done automatically like in the Electrum client?

It's quite good actually if the rate is favourable compared to bitnz. Might be able to convince some of my Slingshot-using friends to finally buy some bitcoin :)

At least he's got an opportunity to buy them back cheaper now.

Yup. Just write down the key which consists of 12 words. My 7 year old nephew managed it pretty well. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:23:23
Creating your own brainwallet word list is never a good idea. It won't have enough entropy compared to one generated through something like Electrum.

As Bitcoin gains popularity it will require more and more resources to operate a node. Should the lack of good speed/fairly priced connectivity for some home users really dictate the number of transactions per second that can be processed?

or "his" perhaps?
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:04:33
True. Them all working for the same company is the definition of centralisation. 
I'd like to see an argument otherwise.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:20:00
True. Centralisation of interest allows changes to the software that are in the best interests of that company, and not in the best interests of bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:43:30
True.  There are times when decentralisation isn't worth the additional cost.  Generally Visa/Mastercard don't block transactions, though it can be an issue when travelling internationally and bitcoin doesn't have this problem.
however, is one case where a decentralised uncensored platform instead would be helpful for free discussion...
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:32:01


Bad example. Posting on Reddit should be compared to using legacy payment systems such as Visa/Mastercard which block transactions on the whims of governments or other pressures.
@_date: 2015-08-01 08:41:59
Must have been intentional. Maybe the guy has a sense of humour.

The default seems a bit low. The default settings should not make them lose money due to excluding backlogged transactions that have fees.

I didn't say I liked the video ;) but I do like to hear opposing views sometimes incase they actually have any good arguments, unfortunately they were lacking in this video.  His arguments seemed pretty simplistic, primarily based around the 51% attack and risk of centralised banking services. I did find it amusing that he thinks one of the flaws in bitcoin is that the price can go to the moon though :)

Well there is an obvious difference after the main peak, but leading up to that peak was reasonably similar. 
Also in the past week it has dropped the same amount relative to the main peak in 2011, and then both were/are relatively stable after nearly the exact same number of days since the main peak.
There is a lot of media coverage this time around so maybe it won't drop off as fast. Who knows...
