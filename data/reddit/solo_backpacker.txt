Lol sounds like a scam

Coinbase doesn’t have support though

Bitcoin is a zero sum game, either it goes to $0 or 10s of millions one day, what do you believe? Pick a side and stay on it

Futures is fake bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-04 01:45:30
Why do you think there’s “fake” exchange bitcoin?

They make money through fees, which have gone through the roof lately. Look into the amount of customer complaints coinbase has in general along with the high fees, one day an exchange like binance or maybe a decentralized exchange with no fees will take over

Be willing to lose everything multiple times before success that is all.

You’re gambling, if you want to never worry about tops/bottoms again start trading.
If you start trading and doing you’re own t/a you won’t have to rely on random people from the internet for financial advice either

Never buy bitcoin with the intention of profiting tomorrow, that’s what trading is for my friend
@_date: 2019-10-20 07:24:31
Only someone trying to break into your house

This has happened multiple times already. Look at bitcoin, litecoin etc
Miners that can’t afford to mine pack up shop and turn them off, meanwhile new more efficient miners are made &amp; the cycle starts all over again. 
I personally think of miners mining close-to-cost as weak hands, just like overleveraged traders

Coinbase is the safest entry-level exchange with the least confusion and is properly regulated just as any actual bank would be. Although the fees are 1-2% higher, the safety ease of use and insurance coinbase has makes it the best option until you get your own ledger/trezor

Wrong site = likely a phishing scam that you sent all your info to

Why would they agree? Their coins would instantly lose value lmfao
@_date: 2019-10-20 03:41:53
So quite likely yes.

Safer now than it was when it was 10-14k 3 months ago, most people don’t understand and just buy out of greed
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:45:26
Why do you care about other people’s bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:05:48
They pose a threat when they can 51% attack the whole network
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:55:28
Just Coinbase bro,  if you want free crypto either trade for it, or get airdropped junk coins with the hope that one day that $3 turns into $50
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:36:25
Dollar cost average they said!! ��‍♂️

They’re going to think it’s a massive risk. You’re going to want to convince them that it is a necessary risk that they shouldn’t miss out on?But hey! Chances are they will buy at prices that won’t even make sense to us now. Less than 0.1% of the population has a bitcoin wallet there’s only 40-50 million wallets. Imagine even 1 billion people were to transact on a daily basis through crypto (it will happen one day!) Also id like to mention the fact that there was $100B yesterday that the U.S just printed, over time currencies become less and less valuable due to inflation and trust. As time goes by and more and more people purchase bitcoin and it becomes more scarce &amp; trustable. It’s a real people’s currency if you ask me! It’s value will always be based on what people are willing to pay &amp; sell them for, unlike a dollar it’s always called a dollar so you never notice it’s true value in constant decline. Every time some dies, loses a private key etc bitcoin becomes more scarce meanwhile more currency is printed everyday to get pumped into assets like real estate, gold, and crypto. The easiest way to explain bitcoin is like real estate. 120 years ago a Mansion in London England may have cost a family €10000 that same mansion today is likely worth upwards of €2-3 million.

Unless you’re going to put a significant amount more than $10, investing in bitcoin doesn’t matter. Long-term you might get yourself a few hundred, or you can take a bigger risk and allocate more of your capital into bitcoin and hope your $5000 turns into 50000
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:59:29
Please don’t ever dollar cost average if you plan to get rich off cryptocurrency ��‍♂️

If you don’t trade, don’t expect to have any idea where the market is going you’re simply strapped in for the ride, most of us traders were waiting on this move for the last few months it was just a matter of time until the descending triangle broke to the downside.
