Yeah my goal overall is to be able to spot the lowest price exchange for a certain coin and the highest price exchange at a glance, perhaps with red and green backgrounds, so arbitrage can quickly be initiated. And then hovering over to show specific rates for all of the others listed. Once finished, I really dont want it to be just another list, too many of those!

0.31488 was the cost of the last maintenance fee which is every 24 hours, its a large chunk, but not too unreasonable for me

If I buy hardware, it doesnt just vanish after 6 months, I don't see why buying cloud hardware should, yet thats how most of them do it, aside from CEX and ZEN as far as I know. If a place allows me to buy hashing power and then resell it or hold on to it for as long as I want, that is good. But having it just vanish after 6 months, or 12 months, is crazy. Just my opinion though :)

Oooh nice, thank you, I am sure I can find somewhere on the list for it :)
Edit: Added a Derivative Markets sub category, hopefully I can find a few others to keep it company. Thanks again!

Guess I wont be trying Xapo. Who needs stress like that, especially on a vacation. I hope they fix your problem AND COMPENSATE you for your trouble.
Xapo, get your god damn shit together.

I do! I believe these guys to be more honest than the traditional cloud mining scheme. But we will see. So far 5 days in and payout is consistent. My house is full of antminers, cant take any more, so I really had to move to the cloud anyways, but the ants helped to pay for it so all is well so far.
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:03:12
Well, almost. After cloud hosting fees its about 0.9, but I am happy :D Its been a long time trading, slowly buying btc, mining hardware, cex ghs, etc etc, consolidated in one spot finally its nearing 1 real btc a day.

Still sorting and rating so its not really complete yet, just want to make sure I got most of the major exchanges? Or are there perhaps any on there that are officially dead that I can remove?
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:58:59
Thanks SpaceTire! They are sorted by a score, which I am just basing off of my own personal experience. Only used 5 of them though at the moment, after I have signed up and tested them all they will be in a proper order based on my experience and the general consensus with ratings when you hover over a link. Plus prices of course when I figure out how to use the various APIs, I want it to be useful!

Nothing on the electric bull, its all hosted at zencloud. Their fee for maintenance is 8 cents a day per MH of scrypt hashing.
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:01:25
doing it this way I assume makes them back their money on hardware instantly, to invest in new hardware, leaving me to wait the 60 days or so to ROI, and them to be able to purchase more/better hardware instantly. At least I assume that must be the reason.
