Indeed, that's something we still have to find an answer to. One of our ideas is to set a minimum amount to donate, another to create an algorithm between upvotes and amount donated to sort the positioning of the project. 
The downvotes we are talking about will work differently from downvotes we are used to on Reddit - it's more of "report scam" kind of downvote that we will later take a look at if it will reach a selected amount of downvotes.

What would be your approach to prevent scam? Our idea as it stands is to let people do their own research and support a project if they have enough facts and proof of of their legitimacy.

We ave launched the platform! You can find it here:

At this point we don't want to hold any money in Escrow - we want people to do their own research and if they want to support the project, they send BTC directly to receivers wallet. No fees. No middleman. Your own responsibility.

Everyone is free to post their projects, site operators included. We will have a downvote system to filter legitimate project from spammy and fake ones.

Exactly. What we present is a way to instantly transfer your money into something that you truly believe. Without any intermediaries or fees. You go through all the information the project author had submitted and if you truly believe in the project, you send them fraction of funds.

When someone downvotes a project, they will be required to submit a reason why did they do it. If a project will get a number of downvotes, we will then manually check it and decide whether it is spam or scam and if we should take it down.

We don't have a smart contract and we don't bound together both parties. Everything is super simple - any project can be posted and upvoted, sending funds directly to receivers wallet. What's even better, we are non-profit, and we don't have No fees whatsoever.

It is not official yet, but we have created a subreddit to find answers to all of the issues we see could happen in our project. It will be open to the public on Monday when we will launch, but you can join the subreddit to follow us through our journey already if you wish.

That's unfortunate. We will think of how to solve the issue - probably we will add Facebook as a method of authentication in the future. As of now, feel free to drop me a PM and I can add the project for you.

Can you tell me specifically what error message you received? We just submitted another test project, and image upload worked fine on our end.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:56:48
Interesting. We have tested the project submit page and we hadn't had an issue like yours before. I will get back with this to our developers and we will see what might have gone wrong. Thanks for the tip!

At this point we want potential backers to see who is the author/creator of the project so than they could evaluate all the aspects before committing their funds for the cause.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:31:42
So did you succeed to submit your project finally?
