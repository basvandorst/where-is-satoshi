btc on mtgox are now trading at $276, perhaps it's that? Perhaps they don't want to reenable withdrawals until they can figure out how they want to respond to that.
Equally, they're over in Japan, perhaps they don't read english-language reddit, and don't realize what's spooked their customers.

Without legal enforcement mechanisms, the expected level of scamming will be higher than if there were legal enforcement mechanisms.

Perhaps, perhaps not. Bitcoins may be blockable at the network level, the cryptography may be vulnerable over the long run, or the government might ban the technology. It's probably quite hard to set up a government proof system for bitcoins overall.

Yes, actually, you could hide it in the digits of the value of the transaction. Okay, there probably is some. It doesn't serve much use, and I can't avoid it without losing some other functionality that I care about.

Um, no. If people are buying BFL products, then the value of having bitcoins increases - you can do more things with them. Unless BFL releases only to high circulation groups, that they release quickly shouldn't make much difference.

Some fraction of the mtgox rate will be day traders and miners - which aren't really part of the useful services economy.

So, as long as mining is a fungible resource, it's still about money, not people, even if it was written/intended to be about people.
I'm saying this because I thought this was a great opportunity when I first heard about bitcoin, I even built it from source on windows, but I couldn't see how to guarentee identity.

No, until someone makes a mathematical breakthrough that allows you to solve it in less than a second.
More fundementally, cryptography is a high rate of change science. 15 years ago, rsa-128 was widely used and thought to be unbreakable, despite the fact that you could break it with pollard's rho for factoring, an algorithm from the 70s.

1. Yes, it hasn't all that many flaws - I think if the assumptions are met, you can't steal coins etc. The assumptions would be 'the cryptographic methods actually work' and 'your computer doesn't have a program running on it to steal your bitcoins.
2) Perhaps - it looks like a distributed database, but it's possible and probably that it can be blocked at the network level, and the network is a necessary part of the bitcoin system
3) Could be - it may well change the world. Have you read the diamond age?
4) As above.
5) Only to a degree - it's something that has been done, but doesn't have full annonymisation, which techno-libertarian philosophy would want.

What's this upcoming trouble cycle then?
@_date: 2012-04-11 15:14:16
1) The short answer is that the number of coins added to the system is near-constant with time, and the difficulty of the calculation needed to create new coins is scalable, and scaled by the network of bitcoin programs running together. Actually, the creation rate decreases slightly with time, and bitcoin creation will be complete at some point.
2) Bitcoins are valuable because you can do things with them that you couldn't before, they are enablers. Extremely small micropayments, or anonymous transactions for transactions the local law enforcement disapprove of are two examples.
3) There's more than one ebay type site running using bitcoins, so that's probably a long question. There are some restaurants where you used to be able to buy a meal using bitcoins.
