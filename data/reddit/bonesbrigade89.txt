You the real mvp
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:24:17
Oh interesting. I'll have to research more to understand more. I guess it's different than coinbase in that you can only buy what other users are trading. Versus coinbase where they get you the amount you need  with the fee
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:17:58
Cool so you just hit limit buy and select amount and it's that easy?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:52:03
Yeah good call. I first bought in before my bank account was verified 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:11:55
Thanks man! Does gdax have an app? Checking now
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:11:12
Just researched it and they are owned by the same company so it seems good to go. Using  the method you mentioned what is the fee or is it free? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:52:05
Cake Bill? Hehe.. yeah I'm gonna see what I can do 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:07:41
Thsnks man. Is that as secure as coinbase? I know some have disappeared over the years with people losing everything 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:14
Can you see what you buy in gdax on coinbase or are they not connected 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:44:29
So leave it in coinbase? Forget splitting it with the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:11:10
Right. I guess I was looking at it from the fiat side. In theory that 0.9 would be worth your initial investment tho. I know people frown on day trading with bitcoin. But I am curious if people skim off these raises in value. Leaving their initial investment in. If you bought 5000 worth of bitcoin. And it jumps to 5964. Can you withdraw the 964. Then say it jumps to 6964 and you shave off , or withdraw the 1000. Then when it dips you wait?

Thank you fine sir.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:01:37
Yeah I purchased with debit card and got 99 cent fee everytime :-(
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:15:20
Thanks for all the info man. I'm literally days in and learning a ton still. Yeah the fees seem to be an obstacle. I planned on just throwing 5 dollars in a day but it's 99 cents on coinbase every time. Seems foolish. If I do 200 it's 7.50 or whatever so guess I should build up and buy in. I imagine the sell fee is same. Dang fees lol.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:50:30
So an altcoin like litecoin? I see you can buy one for 60. Is this similar to buying in at bitcoin say in 2013?  Assuming litecoin will go anywhere. Eth also is "cheaper"
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:52:52
Put the deposit amounts thru home computer versus mobile and it instantly verified it
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:32:45
Is hodl a joke misspelling hold or some legit initials lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:00:26
Oh ok haha. Newb checking in
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:02:27
It's instant that way tho. Seems easier to lock in buy in Amount with card? Oh one more question. How long does it take if you sell for it to appear in your account? Or have you not done that yet
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:23:31
I'm a certified newb. But how would a cash out for 4.4 million work exactly. I assume say coinbase would take an insane fee. But without government involvement would it be taxed? Or just appear in my account in 2 to 5 days lol 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:37:42
Thanks for this awesome info. I'm new too. If I only have 20 dollars in coinbase. All fees considered should I still move even that low an amount before the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:52:19
Dude... that worked instantly. Thank you for that easy fix!! Happy I posted here
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:42:23
They weren't a help. They said they see same thing
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:35:57
Thank you. I'm going to call my bank first to see if they can see different or omitted deposit amounts
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:38:07
So restart the verification process as in remove bank account and re add it on my home computer versus mobile?  Or put in those two 0.03 deposits on home comp. Wasn't sure what part you were recommending doing on comp. thanks!
