I am sure in Mac OS, that it is safe from many viruses, but no one could be sure that it won't get such virus as Troyan.

Is this reliable information?

You are lucky if you aren't worry about a transaction. I wish i could not worry too, the practice shows that there is a 5-10% risk every time you make a transaction.

don't call us fuckers and don't store you money online, that's it

It's a big mistake to have same password for everything
@_date: 2014-02-18 11:45:07
Sorry about your situation! That's weird this site is doing wrong! I agree there must be a site or a topic there we can know about one or other scam with bitcoin as you had
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:30:35
it's very hard to find site you can trust
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:56:57

I sent two stories - about myself and a friend and he says he'll want 1.5 btc if his story won, the greedy s.o.b., and I bet he does not even know what a bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:13:36
It looks more like a joke not a news. So glad I am not the only one who think this is unnessasary to build a bitcoin bank.

Chinese people know what they are doing, it could be a good sign for other nations, maybe they will also change their attitude to btc.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:32:11
can micro payment channels solve this problem?
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:01:37
