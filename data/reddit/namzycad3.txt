Me too, will let this as a chance for the community to trained our self how to "verify". But at the same time Satoshi being so silent until now is worrisome, he might dead already who knows, it might be good for Bitcoin holders if he no long around. I just wish that he can stay alive longer to see the future of Bitcoin.
