It's not the sale, but rather the purchase that is taxed, meaning the buyer pays the tax. In the US, it is commonly called a "use" tax.

The government gets a cut of your car or home sale through taxes.

As far as I know, you cannot make cash deposits from the US due to regulatory issues.

They seem like a poor choice for Americans at the moment. Their XBT/USD (BTC/USD) volume is shit and I'm unable to deposit USD to Kraken. As soon as that gets figured out, I'll definitely switch.

From what I understand, the only critical part of a wallet is the private keys, therefore you really only need to back up after the creation of a new address along with a corresponding private key; although I may be wrong. All transaction information is public on the blockchain and shouldn't need to be backed up.
The wallet.dat file is typcally stored in 
That is true at least for Bitcoin-Qt, I do not know where Multibit stores it's wallet. According to the Multibit help pages:

Do you actually see a trend of homeless veterans? Any idea why? I feel like all through school we always heard that veterans are more marketable for jobs. Is there a psychological issue reintegrating into society? Do you think government sponsored work programs could help?

Bitcoin private keys are just 256-bit numbers, meaning there are 2^256 possible combinations. Assuming you are able to generate 10 keys per second, it would take 3.672x10^68 years to generate all possible private keys. For comparison, the universe is 1.4x10^10 years old. 
The odds are essentially zero.
As Mknox1982 pointed out, I mistakenly wrote that there were 2x10^256 possible private keys.

I ordered from you last night! 
I'd be interested if you would care to briefly explain the benefit and difference of a "handcrafted bar of high quality soap" over other store bought soaps. I know next to nothing about soaps.

If blockchain.info still has the private key for the address where you stored your coins, you are not safe. Whoever has the private key controls the coins. If you don't want blockchain.info to have any connection to your coins, create a new address with Multibit and send the coins to that address.
Yes, if you regularly back up your wallet, which contains the private keys, you are safe if your computer crashes. Although someone could still steal your wallet.dat from your computer.

I believe the buy order you described only occurs when coinbase reaches their daily limits, they give you the option to buy at market price on the day the order is finalized. Otherwise, the price is set when you buy the coins.

I think its much more likely I can buy groceries with BTC than gold, lol.

Same thing is happening on bitstamp.

I've never heard of such a service. 
I think your best bet would be selling through [localbitcoins.com]( Also I've seen some people selling prepaid credit cards for bitcoins, you can probably find them on bitmit.

The wallet.dat file used by bitcoin-qt.

I don't believe so, most are going to be cash transactions, though.
@_date: 2013-03-02 18:23:43
Because chargebacks. What's to keep you from buying 50 BTC with your credit card then issuing a chargeback? Thats why companies are asking for copies of identification (mt.gox) and have very tight anti-fraud measures (coinbase). 
If you want to get bitcoins hassle free, you need to buy them with physical money.

You are correct, there are only 2^256 private keys, I have adjusted my numbers.
Public and private addresses are usually shown in wallet import format (base58 encoding with a few modifications) to improve portability as it uses alpha-numeric characters only. Although, this process is easily reversed to get the private key in hex, which is used in the bitcoin protocol.

From the prepaid cards I've used in the past, you only have to provide personal info if you plan on using the card for online purchases, otherwise, it's anonymous (aside from transaction records).
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:00:54
When you buy with coinbase.com, the price is locked-in at the time of purchase, you just have to wait approximately 4 days to have the coins and be able to sell.
You can also look on localbitcoins.com, although there has recently been concern about scamming.
Bitinstant.com is another popular alternative, they allow you to deposit cash at major banks, they usually allow BTC to be sent to an arbitrary address, although currently they only support deposits to Mt.Gox.

Unfortunately, there are other ways to get infected, recently there's been a series of Java 0-day exploits. If you visited a webpage that has a hidden malicious Java applet, it would download a piece of malware from the internet and execute it on your computer. That piece of malware could be used to log website passwords or steal a wallet.dat file stored on the computer.
These types of attacks are rare, but are usually well hidden and utilized by highly skilled attackers. Once security analysts become aware and are able to issue patches, damage could already have been done.
