So, i need to be very fast to get the tx in hex, mutate the transaction, submit before the other has been accepted and pray that the mutated get approved before the original one?

But with that you will modify the input ScriptSig, and the txhash will be propagated by the network, and the first transaction to be confirmed will get approved and the other declined.

I tried with  to submit a mutated transaction, but it every time i try to do that it appears something like this "An outpoint is already spent in [DBBitcoinTx [txIndex=68563724,  getEstimatedBTCSent()=0, isGeneratedBlockReward()=false, getTotalBTCSent()=0, getHash()=eb55bf56cf14af9c2e787bd64ede298da2a51e4ef8f98309cc84668526061a68, getVersion()=1, getSize()=473, toString()=BitcoinTx{hash=eb55bf56cf14af9c2e787bd64ede298da2a51e4ef8f98309cc84668526061a68, version=1, lockTime=0, in=[], out=[]}, getClass()=class piuk.blockchain_db.DBBitcoinTx]] [(68561334, 0), (68539551, 2)]"

I know that "?format=hex" but, because is not propagated it can't find the raw transaction in hex.
EDIT: Used  and it say's "Transaction not found"

And how can i do that? How can i submit two transactions at the same time using the same UTXO inputs with different destination addresses? i need to manual build the transactions?

I use blockchain. And i know that to make a bitcoin transaction i need to get my private key, but i don't know how..

I was trying to mutate a transaction.. I don't know how to double-spends works. How can i double spend? Its by putting 2 same transactions at the same time and wait to both get approved?

I just want to know how to manual build and send a bitcoin transaction.

Thank you sir!

How can i find my private key using the Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:47:27
But i can't create the mutated transaction before submit the original one, because i need to get the original tx in hex format, and you can't get that if you don't submit the transaction? If i could get the raw transaction in hex it would be easy for me to pull of a transaction malleability attack if the system is not patched.

Yes, it's mine.. But with the private key, how can i get that?
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:02:11
Ok, i will try with Bitcoin Core. And one more thing, why can't we just create a mutated transaction by adding 2 more bits, like 8d4d4700 before it hit 1 confirmation?
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:51:47
I used other methode :b but there is one thing i don't understand, why can't we get the raw transaction. What changes after i approve the transaction? It is the same hash but it display's the raw transaction.
