Yes I use Mycelium from time to time, it allows you to pick between a normal fee or priority.

Nice, I really don't think the barrier to enter and use bitcoin is as terrible as some people complain about. However the concepts are the scary aspect to newcomers I would imagine. Good luck with your bet(s), I don't feel knowledgeable enough with sports to bet. I tend to stick with blackjack or dice, or the best alternative imho of investing in the casinos bankroll.

Gotta say good choice, although your lime jarrito looks more like tamarind.

BGS2.0 Checking in here. First off I've got to congratulate you on the sleek site. It's very streamlined and easy to use, I see and hope for much success in your future. 
I really enjoyed the varied options of circles, it helped me feel like I could hedge or break those losing streaks. Setting/editing the wager is a breeze and allows quick re-bets at different magnitudes. The penguins add a laugh here and there - I kept playing a little longer hoping to see rockets or UFO's, to no avail. I think it would be a cool addition to "burst" random ballons and possibly win or lose bitcents. (not sure how tough coding something like that would be)
You guys really found a nice balance between the sound effects of winning vs. losing - which may have been completely unintentional. Whenever I lost a bet the noise wasn't "depressing" while the winning tick/ca-ching continually felt intoxicating and urged me to play again! Great job.
Best of all, I ended up making the same amount of bitcoins playing SatoshiCircle in 30 minutes than I would have running my GPU all day!
