It’s simply just not sustainable once mass adoption grows. Where do we draw the limit on how large they can go? And who can handle mining these giant blocks? One or two mining pools? Well damn, they now have complete control. So much for being decentralized... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:44:25
Done. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:46:03
I think they still have plenty of time. Bitcoin is still what the masses have heard of, altcoins are a niche within the crypto niche. With the global scale, no size of blocks will be enough to compete, with say, visa. All the altcoins are effective right now, because they simply aren’t used. They will all run into the scaling issue, scrambling to figure out how to fix it,  once they obtain any kind of adoption. Mainstream adoption requires a different protocol, blockchain isn’t going to cut it.  
Bitcoin has the best of the best developers. If ver “wins” this “civil war” he created, it will be very short lived.  Where bitcoin is going, is much larger than anyplace the others have planned for. And that takes very well thought out, cognizant decisions. If these plans can be changed because Ver goes Scrooge mcduck, well, then you never had much faith in the original plan to begin with.  We are talking about a global financial revolution here folks. Not what coin can get their money on Silk Road the quickest and cheapest.

This is the reason the IRS is requiring Coinbase records of all accounts w/ more than 20k in transactions a few years back, If the majority had done  their taxes right, they wouldn't have the grounds to have a judge grant the request.

He isn't verified far enough to trade on gdax. Otherwise, that may be a viable option to trade for a different coin (they still arnt offering bch pairs in anything but usd). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:09:05
Whelp, if that's the case, the IRS is gonna want you to self report and pay the short term capitals gains on the profit on the amount. This in reality is a tax nightmare for the user, and the IRS knows this. Could you imagine having to track and make a record of every purchase (BTC, USD, whatever) made throughout the year?

While I'm sure spam transactions contributed to clogging the mempool, once the run started, not sure if they were even necessary anymore to keep it clogged (I haven't paid much attention as I'm not moving my coins and these corrections no longer scare me). Either way, this is not spam, unless they have really upped their game in disguising them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:32
You blind? All the evidence was just presented. What else do you want? Screenshots of everything stated? It’s all there except and email or recorded call to Ver, which I’m sure something of the sort will turn up. This isn’t going to be easily swept under the rug for either CB or Bcash. CME uses them for future prices, which is going to be the SECs reasoning to investigate.  If you don’t think the SEC has been waiting for a slip up, your crazy. This just landed in their lap with a giant bow.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:59:10
who knows. avoid it!
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:30:57
BCH will still take well over an hour to fully confirm and BCH is dumping right now. Plus all the fees you'll be paying to CB since you cant just trade it on gdax. For the few bitcoins to be sold/rebought in diff coin, you will be paying hundreds, not even considering that you won't be getting market price. So not ideal in this situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:59:02
That's true but the market has a short memory. I wouldn't be surprised if they canned a small fish customer service rep as a scapegoat and delisted bch shortly after. I think CB will be ok if they take action to appease the masses quickly. They have done everything to go by the book up until yesterday. If CB ends up going belly up for insolvency, I can guarantee you every other exchange is much more worse off. And we are all fucked (at least for the next few years), regardless of your coin of choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:36:32
You record the difference between the buy price and $7k as long term capital gains, as you held for more than a year. When you sell next, record the difference between the new price you bought in (7k?) and the price you sold for capital gains. 
If you sell again within a year from when you bought the second time, the difference will be taxed short term capital gains. If this happens, you basically just charged yourself an additional 15% + for nothing. This is based upon USA capital gains laws.

1st correction? Actually like the 6th this year... Or you talking about the correction of the correction of the correction? The way I see it is its all one big correction, starting all the way back in 2010. So instead of separating them out, clump them together. It just so happens bitcoin corrects up in price. So, it works out. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:57

Yeah, don’t do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:18:26
Well, it’s a fork that claims it’s the “real”  bitcoin and using its decently wealthy, yet unstable,  backers to push that agenda to high heaven.  
From coordinated attacks to tricking newcomers into thinking they are buying bitcoin, when they aren’t. It’s terrible for the whole crypto market. Who would want to invest in something, knowing that a special interest group can just take it over, making the original virtually worthless? The code is similar to bitcoin, except larger blocks, which makes fees lower at the moment, but not any faster, as they claim.  
It’s very shortsighted as larger blocks don’t fix the scaling issue that bitcoin is  currently developing solutions for, Once further adaption grows of crypto, increasing block size seams like their go to, which centralizes the coin more as only a few select miners will be able to handle the blocks.  Basically meaning they will have control over the whole infrastructure.  Bigger blocks will never be big enough to handle any substantial volume. 
It’s nothing but a money grab that only has the bitcoin name going for it. The model is not sustainable. It’s just another run of the mill alt once you take the name “bitcoin” out of it. Stay away is my advice.. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:25:51
That is correct. But all honesty, with all the nonsence going on, unless you really need to get it out, I would give it a few days, fees aside. I think the Coinbase launch was Ver's last hope, and that didn't go over too well. He is going to be desperate at this point and no telling what him and his miner buddies are capable of after the millions they have put in is proving fruitless. I wouldn't put a transaction in the mempool right now and would consider my funds much safer in CB for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:09
68%..... Pretty eye opening, shocking actually, I know.
No, not how far down we are going, that's how much we are still UP in the last month. Relax. These mass sells/panic have been happening like clockwork every one to two months in the last year. And bounces back with a vengeance every time. Once the bounce happens and all the alts stop pumping, all that alt coin cash is coming right back to btc.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:42
Yeah. But the thing is, these bad actors are going to force regulation, damaging the whole crypto space. Especially when CB appears to be involved, where innocent grandpa buys his coins.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:27:29
The way I see it, is the core developers are looking longer term and larger scale than what the quick fixes offer. They are aware of the quick fixes, however; a band aid isn't the best option. They obviously have a stake in bitcoin's success and they are more than competent to realize the current issues. 
Let the weak hands jump ship. I'll be more than happy to buy their coins off them. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:42:08
Yeah, and looking though his post history, looks like he/she deals quite a bit with stolen credit cards on the dark web. So even if he did pull through w/ buying you something off Amazon, it would likely be bought with a stolen credit card, implicating the receiver for fraud.

"rip the faces off anyone who tries to buy it"
I don't even understand what that means. Please elaborate.
So there are 100+ "central banks", all competing against each other. I don't think "central bank" means what you think it means.
Don't give accurate quotes? Huh? Somebody wants to sell for a price, and somebody decides to buy for that price. How is that not an accurate quote?
I don't think you have any idea what you are talking about. At all. Nothing you have said makes any logical sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:55
Your call. But I don't believe in it one bit and refuse to hold anything that makes me second guess my morals. At the same time, I would wait to see what the price does after Coinbase actually starts letting it trade. If I could hold off an extra day and sell to Roger at an inflated price, why not?

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:35:02
Short it. Nobody is going to tell you not to.  You have got this market figured out. 
I think you underestimate the majority that hold bitcoin. Not alot of panic sellers and they quickly buy the dip. And see way more potential in bitcoin other than a quick buck. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:00
When you have been through all the crap that bitcoin has been through (especially in the last year), and it comes out stronger, you learn not to trust your gut that says sell. And we have been rewarded very well, as a result. I would be a liar to say its been easy, but emotions have eaten people alive in this space. When in doubt, get off reddit for a week.

@_date: 2017-11-03 05:18:39
Whenever you buy or sell on Coinbase, the price is locked in, even though it takes a week to get your coins/receive cash to your checking account. Just keep in mind that on top of the fees, the price you buy/sell on CB is NOT what the current market value. They take a chunk out of that too. 
Yes, you can keep your coins on CB. Taking them offline and controlling your wallet yourself is the best option, but if you are gong to keep them on an exchange, they are your best bet.
 As for advice, don't put in more than you can afford to lose and don't panic when the inevitable volatility comes. It has worked out for everybody that has hedl tight so far. Take a look at the China situation that happened in September... Everybody could have sworn that was the end, dipping to 3k and look at it now, less than 1.5 months later. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:08:03
Fuck North Korea. I don't want bitcoin to be associated with them at all. Imagine what would happen if word got out it bitcoin truly was funding rocket boy's bombs? Shit would be cracked down (rightfully) hard. You would be ok if your miners fees were funding this shit? That would be the point where I sell everything. 
Edit: I got all fired up before I finished reading your comment. Sarcasm. I get it. But point still stands. Don't taint my bitcoin.

Its complicated. You wouldn't get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:37
Not exactly. Pointing out there is plenty of cash out there that hasn't even been touched. And the scarcity of bitcoin is what makes it look expensive. Most people's brains can't wrap their head around that. So just a different angle on how to wrap your (and anybody elses your trying to spread the good word of bitcoin to) head around that $10,000 is not actually that much. Its all relative.

The short squeeze from all the haters was enough to make it pop as soon as it crossed 10k. But I would be surprised if it didn't dip below 10k again, temporarily, once people wake up, the media covers it, and your neighbor Frank decides to sell to buy a new TV.

I think that's a decent balance. Although if you are a student, no kids/family, you could be a little more risky and turn some of that gold into more bitcoin. If you can afford to lose it and you can stomach the roller coaster of course.

The fact that most exchanges require 6 confirmations and lack of more advanced bitcoin financial tools makes arbitrage difficult, thus why the prices don't quickly correct to mirror other exchanges. Who knows what the price on either of the exchange will do in the 30+ minutes for confirmations to go through.

But you argue with EVERY SINGLE POINT somebody makes. Why do you ask for opinions when you are closed minded anyway and already made up your mind? And then insult the community with every post/comment you make?  I'm not going to "Argue against it being a bubble". I'm going to call you out for being a troll as you are trying to convince everybody that their investment is a bubble with your fallacies. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:33:56
20 confirmations is required before you are credited with any BCH to use on the exchange you send to it, it does not affect withdraws. Whenever those are available will depend on your wallet's settings. BCH is not affected by the fork, so send away while its occurring. I'm sure Kraken will support Segwit 2, but haven't heard any official word. Also, Kraken sucks. Find a new exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:37
Bubble? This is the issue with that statement. This is uncharted territory. Bitcoin is not a tulip, a tech stock, or anything that has ever existed.
Comparisons to any of the sort are completely useless as there has never been anything of the sort before. Do you know how long people hodling bitcoin have been hearing this? Years... If bitcoin is  bubble, what does that make the USD? The opposite? Is that somehow better? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:32:13
Yup. Sell when its recovering and the other coin is going down. Solid plan. I'm pretty sure the big dawgs are out of btc to sell. They threw all the had, which was their only hope for the plan to succeed ,but this is btc. Resilient as F

Hmmm. I guess I never paid much attention to GBP/BTC on GDAX. On the USD exchange, orders that size are nearly always present on both sides within a few dollars of the current price. Looking at the volume of GBP on GDAX (less than 500 BTC today), I can see your concern. But then again, the low volume on that exchange means that it is going to do absolutely nothing on stopping a rally within the bigger picture, although may very temporarily cause an effect on that particular exchange.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:43:39

Yeah. we need more info. Was that not the address you sent it to? Did you not send it anywhere and somebody hacked it? But you are right, you can't undo the transaction, unless you have access to the address it was sent to. And damn! A $15 fee!!! That's a lot. If you got hacked looks like somebody was looking to get it through asap. Sorry bud. My condolences.
Check any other wallets you have. Maybe you copied and pasted a previous address on accident? Did you maybe send it to a bcash address? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:02:05
Just keep in mind it’s not always fun and games. It feels good when it’s up. Not so much when it’s  down. If you’re investing everything, pretty damn stressful when 30% of your nest egg gets wiped out in a matter of hours, but perhaps the swings will taper off once CME futures start.  Like others said... HODL, learn how to safely store them, and brace yourself self for the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:18:00
A sell order for 23.65 BTC? That looks like a normal, everyday order to me. If there is a rally, that will get eaten up in no time. An order to sell several thousand may be noteworthy.

It could go either way. No doubt. The unexpected has happened with bitcoin over and over. And there is a new crisis every other month and takes a huge hit. But every time, so far, it has come back with a vengeance, especially within the last year. 
The fact is that even though $10,000 seams really expensive, keep in mind that there will only be some 21 million of them. In the big scheme of things, its really not all that much. The fact that your inquiring about it makes you ahead of 95% of everybody else and I only see adoption increasing. 
I can't say for sure what will happen in the future, but so far, it has overcome things that I was for sure would be the end.  Don't buy more than you can afford, don't panic when the next crisis happens next month, and you have a chance at turning a few bucks into something more substantial. Or lose it all. Nobody can tell you for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:18

I think the bitcoin currency shipped has sailed. Its not the fastest and most technologically advanced by a long shot. What makes gold valuable? Its not the prettiest or versatile medal, but its scarce and GOLD! Everybody knows what gold represents.  Some other crypto will come and take that place.

Its a currency so if you just keep 1 bitcoin you purchase, it will always be 1 bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin does not shrink or grow, unless a fork occurs, but lets ignore for simplicity sake. Just as a dollar bill will always be a dollar bill, regardless of what it can actually buy.
While the value of bitcoin changes, it is in relation to the purchasing power of the bitcoin or relation to other currencies. If the value grows 100%, 1 bitcoin is still 1 bitcoin, but it can now buy double the amount of Big Macs that it could before. The value can and does fluctuate, just as the value of USD to Euro, although a bit more drastically and frequently.
Anyone you ask here expects it to grow and are bitcoin enthusiast, myself included. For all that say it will skyrocket, I'm sure you can find an equal amount of people on a different subreddit that will claim its a ponzi scheme and will fail. Do your own research and make up your own mind. I'm all for investing but don't put in more than you can afford to lose as who knows what the future holds. Learn how to safely secure any bitcoin you obtain.
