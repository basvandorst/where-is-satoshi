I agree that it's overblown, or I hope it is. Everyone is acting like Wall Street has a huge conspiracy against bitcoin and wants to crash it for their personal gains. Not saying I trust Wall Street, but market manipulation of that level should stand out a bit and it isn't exactly legal to own a bunch of something, buy into a future you would stand to profit from if it dropped, and then directly sell a bunch of that to drop the market.
Buying into futures shorting bitcoin would discourage those investors from helping bitcoin go up in price, but they aren't allowed to blatantly crash the market for a profit.

The legal answer: Every time you switch between cryptos you should realize gains/losses depending on the values of the two cryptos for every trade. In the US at least, it is treated as basically cashing out the BTC into USD, using that USD to then buy LTC...then later turning the LTC into USD to buy BTC again.
Now realistically, unless you're day trading cryptos and making significant income from it, or trading in large volume, you're not worth the IRS's time. If this is a one-off or once in a while transaction just make sure you report the gains once you actually do convert back to fiat.

Just want to clear up, you don't really get $100 worth of the new currency, more if you have 0.5 BTC before the fork, you get 0.5 Bitcoin Granite or whatever the new currency is. Right after the fork that 0.5 of BTG could be only worth $50 if no one sees value in that forked currency.

People seem to confuse lucky investing with smart investing. Putting all of your life savings into bitcoin, which let's be completely honest is still in the "proving itself" part of it's life (thus the potential for significant gains on the investment), might get you rich but is bad investing.
Get a secure job, save 10%, invest what you can in a variety of options (401k, stocks, crypto, property), and live within your means to enjoy life.

That's my thinking as well.
Hit or got close enough to $3000 for someone(s) to sell a bunch. That triggered a panic or stop-loss orders to sell as well. Right now is a bunch of people not sure if it's going to hold or do another drop.
This is kind of making me doubt how well it'll hold through the beginning of August. I held my coin/used it during the drop to $200, so whatever, at this point it's money I left in an old pair of pants I randomly found again... But that might be one wild ride.

Because the US government and political situation of today is the same as 70 years ago.
I don't think most people in the 40's even knew that was going on.
