I would assume control of the wallet. I'm open to suggestion on how to ensure people could see that I wasn't taking any for myself. I suppose I wouldn't even have to control it if there was a better way of doing it.

Wow this is actually really neat! I created a bitcoin account through reddit and now have the ability to tip other users as well as withdraw into my Coinbase account. This seems like it would be a great way to create fundraising projects!

I'm starting to really wish I knew how to create online gaming sites

Yeah I'm actually a bit puzzled myself. As far as I have figured out myself you can tip people on reddit using this tipbot. Essentially you send the tip to the bot and the receiver of said tip withdraws it using the link provided. However I'm still not to sure if I did it correctly.

Yeah that's probably a good idea. So give everyone a a ticket number and let the generator do the rest of the work.

Why is it dumb? You seem to highly resent this idea. If it could do some charitable good why not?

I love it. This really is the perfect way to ensure everyone knows its random. I'm really going to have to sit down and figure out the math though. What kind of legal issues could possibly effect the lottery?

Doesn't EVE online encourage scams as its just part of the massive economic simulation? I always here about people tricking board members in massive corporations to sell shares or make the wrong business decisions that lead to financial ruin of all but one member. 
Either way I started this thread because I wanted insight as to how to create a completely fair system.

somebody somewhere is more then likely doing this right now.

Oh nice! Any chance your going to use the power for good!? Charity?
