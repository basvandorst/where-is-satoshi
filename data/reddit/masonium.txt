That's not what the article is implying. 
The "Wealth Effect" referred to in the article suggests that people feel more confident in spending because their portfolios are doing better. It does *not* imply that they cash out their portfolios to increase spending.

Just because there are two outcomes, doesn't mean each outcome has a 50% chance. If you buy a powerball ticket, you can divide the outcome into "wins jackpot" and "doesn't win jackpot". That doesn't make the possibility of winning a jackpot 50%.

The information is interesting. The *graphic* is awful. 
A bar chart (with a logarithmic axis) would be *so* much better. People are quite bad at estimating the ratios of areas of circles. (The fake 3D lighting also makes you wonder if you're supposed to be comparing volumes, which would be even more difficult visually). 
Hell, even just a table with all values in billions and the decimal points aligned, would be much better.

Probably not. Warren Buffett is infamous for his lack of understanding of technology, at least in terms of tech stocks.
