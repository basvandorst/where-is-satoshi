Aaahahahaaa! Yes, I'm getting plenty of sleep, thanks, nothing wrong here!
I can't believe I've been telling myself that for a month and a half.

The answer depends partly on what you'll do with the funds you convert it to and partly on how long you think The State will be able to hold off bankruptcy. BTC to the moon happens when they (UK for you I guess) decide to emulate Zimbabwe. BTC trending upward versus your local currency happens for as long as politicians favor inflation except when your local currency is rising against all others like the dollar has been in recent years. You have no control over any of this except how you use your withdrawals. Saying HODL forever is silly unless you have nothing better to bank on than the collapse of The State (which is certainly desirable for many reasons, but not something I'm banking on personally). So I'd say hold until you find an opportunity worth investing in.
One BTC-related opportunity I'm considering right now is the Mycelium wallet tokens. I missed the crowdsale, but hopefully they'll be on an exchange soon. My second BTC-related choice right now would be to swap a fraction of my BTC for ETH, because I'm not convinced that The DAO is the end of ETH, and I'm hearing a lot of people shouting that it is, which makes me think it's oversold. Outside of crypto currencies there are loads of other options worth considering in my opinion, starting with silver, foreign real estate, or a well-built lifestyle business.

Very interesting talk from Andreas Antonopolous, thanks for sharing it. I did not see anything in the first two links that really scare me away from using Coinbase. What am I missing? The reason I use Coinbase is that they make it easy to connect

For me, with S7s and power at $0.053/kWh, it's about $300 now, $150 after the halving, assuming the difficulty doesn't change much. But I'm guessing that with S9s and SP50s coming online and S5s and SP20s turning off, global hashing power will increase enough to cause a significant increase in the difficulty.

Just thinking out loud here, because I'm not sure either, but here's how I understand it:
Reward halves, miners drop out, network detects lower hash rate and adjusts difficulty downward within 2016 blocks to compensate, lower difficulty lures miners back in, cycle repeats. As I understand it, Satoshi's design intent was that, as rewards diminish from halving, broader adoption would translate to more transactions, which would mean more transaction fees to make up for the diminishing rewards. However, the current block size limits the network to 7 transactions per second. I think that's tied in with new block discovery being allowed every 10 minutes or so. At 7tps for 10 minutes, the max number of transactions in a block is 4200, which means transaction fees would have to average about 0.006 BTC to compensate miners as well as they are now.
Did I miss anything? Somebody correct me if I got anything wrong?

I was going to say that having my bank account connected to a wallet makes it easy to pay my mining expenses (I cash out 1 BTC a month). However, I agree, I would not keep a stash of BTC in Coinbase precisely because of its cozy connection with banks. I'm using Mycelium for BTC I want to hold, and I think when that account gets big enough to worry about I'll get a Trezor (somewhere less than 20 BTC, I think). Is there some other reason I shouldn't use Coinbase though, even for short terms? Are you suggesting that Coinbase somehow has access to my private key?

I'm wondering what you find concerning in this. It actually sounds really good to me, especially that last line.
I've been reading both this sub and for a couple weeks, and even though this post has nothing to do with the scaling debate, it's the first thing I've seen that really helps me come to a conclusion on that issue.

That's a great lecture and I enjoyed it, but Stefan says nothing about bitcoin or Blockstream in it. Could you possibly explain why you see a link between Blockstream's defensive patent strategy and future price appreciation?
@_date: 2016-07-20 19:13:13
I agree, but: All that makes Blockstream's pledge more legally binding than Coinbase's blog post is that they're backing it up with the DPL, which can be withdrawn by 180 days written notice published on "a publicly available website." If Blockstream later withdraws from the DPL, any free licenses they've granted to other DPL community members under DPL terms remain in effect, but DPL community members who have granted licenses to Blockstream under DPL terms have the right to convert those licenses to commercial terms.
This still looks good for the bitcoin community, for sure, as long as other bitcoin community members also become DPL community members and ritually obtain licenses for all bitcoin related technology offered under DPL terms. The more parties involved in this way, the greater the positive impact for the bitcoin community. Am I seeing this right?
Admittedly, I haven't yet read the entire DPL.

Yes the currency that's baked by gold is exchangeable for gold, but that doesn't mean another country's currency is. If the US went back on the 1913 gold standard, the (just for example) Canadian dollar would not be redeemable for gold at the US Treasury, and the USD/CAD exchange rate would start dropping fast.

Ha. 
That article mentioned "a forthcoming technical event known as the block halving" ... Does Roger Ver know about this?

And what's the problem with expansion of wealth? There's no reason the money supply has to expand proportionally. If the USD is worth more because it's backed by gold (or baked by gold, haha), consumer goods just go down in price. That doesn't hurt the sellers in the long run though, because the currency is worth more. And it's not called hoarding, it's called saving, and it's good for the economy. A spiraling debt cycle is what destroys economies, not prudent reinvestment of capital.
