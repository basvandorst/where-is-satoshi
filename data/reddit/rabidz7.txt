I would try to hack them.

Why 1920x1080? 1920x1200 and 1920x1440 are much better choices as 16:9 is disgusting.

Eh, I'd take 800x600 or 1024x640 over the abomination that is 16:9. 16:9 is only common because nobody cares about quality.

It's only the most common in monitors that are pieces of shit.

You're advocating to take away innocent, harmless people's freedom and property away because of your misguided beliefs? People don't use drugs at increased rates because they are legal.

Desomorphine is no more dangerous or harmful than morphine, heroin, oxymorphone (Opana) or hydromorphone (Dualuid). The complications seen in Krokodil users are due to the bathtub type synthesis procedures that are used. People end up shooting elemental iodine, red phosphorus and strong acids or bases.  In a legal market, desomorphine would be legal and regulated. Addiction would still not be good, but it would not involve injecting poisonous and caustic chemicals along with the drug.

Banning heroin puts users in far more danger than if it was legal. Heroin and most other opioids are physically-benign substances. The only danger is overdose and perhaps constipation. Junkies end up the way they do because of their lifestyle. They struggle to get jobs, are ostracized and the drugs they get are never of good quality. Giving people who suffered from addiction access to affordable heroin that was pure and regulated would save countless lives. Prohibition also creates a huge black-market opportunity. Decriminalization would do nothing to curb the cartel system.

All chemicals, plants or fungi that have a recreational, medical or entheogenic se should be legal and available without restriction.

If people are only harming themselves out of there own will, why should society tell them what they can do? Yes, addiction should be treated as a medical issue. All drugs can be used responsibly. Some (marihuana, GABAergic depressants) are easier to control than others (opioids). Just using a drug recreationally is not abuse or an addiction. And what about thing like psychedelics and dissasosiatives where people might have spiritual or introspective reasons for using the drugs, which are generally proven to be safe and non-addictive?

Government theft for whatever they decide is a crime.

It is legal under current jurisdiction.

Those are stolen coins.
