I'll share the btc in the form of tips to anyone who upvotes me and comments on this. I will give an even percentage to everyone, I stake my reputation on it.
Think of it like pooled mining. 
ok cutting off the rewarded comments now. I will give 1/46th of the money to the 46 comments with the top 'minutes ago' time.
I'm watching the 49ers game now, so I'll give the money during halftime.
Wow the 49ers are doing well!
I distributed the reward of 0.01 mBTC to everyone who commented in time. 
Haha all of this was waaaayyy too much work for just 20 cents!

The Family Marts in Taiwan sell bitcoin, they just don't advertise it at all.

I've used this method extensively, it's been up and running for about 3 months. The issue is that in order to buy them you need to know how to navigate 4 levels of ui and search for bitcoin in a specific search box. You also need a Taiwan cell phone. 
Because of this, very few people actually use the service, and it's likely to be discontinued soon.
