Long term btc holder, but now really is a terrible time to get in compared to when we dip.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:03:06
Don't. Now is a terrible time to get in. Do some research on altcoins, invest in some other coins short-medium term, then use your profits to buy the btc dip and wait for good news

Yes I literally also told him to research

I agree that the whitepaper states this, but my impression was that this community had forsaken this vision with the decision that 2nd layer options were preferable for the overall vision to become a success. Perhaps this impression has been put into me with fake information and members who are misrepresenting what the community stands for, but my interpretation of the development and moderation policies seems to confirm the same thing.
If Bitcoin is indeed still intended to be used as a medium for exchange, why has it moved backwards in transaction speed and cost, and what is being done to remedy this?

Where are these "thousands and thousands" that can *only* survive by accepting bitcoin core? In any case, they function the same whether btc is $1 or $100,000, and stop functioning the same when transactions are literally too expensive and time consuming.

The official position literally is the official implementation that is currently live, right now. If the way things are run, fees are high, and complaining about it gets your banned, then this means that the official position is that high fees are what we are intending here.
Does your bitcoin debit card send the transaction through the network? If so, could you show me these 'beers every day' and the associated fees? Would be great if you could show me how to get low enough fees to justify paying for such small purchases with it. Right now I'm mostly cashed out of Bitcoin because I'm not sure about the price, and the last few times I've moved funds around I've had to pay enormous fees, and it's been a problem to me. I'm sure my choice of wallet might have an effect, but it's hard to find reliable information on how to get fast transactions with low fees, and I've come to be taught that this is because Bitcoin is specifically not trying to do this. This genuinely is my experience, so if you're not just trolling to mess with me, an answer that clears this up for me in the future would be fantastic.

What is the scam? Fair to call it an alt if you have a 'one true bitcoin' philosophy, and I respect the opinion, but it's a stretch to call  market cap coin a scam, unless you're saying everything except BTC is a scam (which needless to say, would make crypto a scam as a whole).

So you've learnt to be a sheep? One could argue the same for any product, asset or technology, but it doesn't make it any more of a valid lesson to have learnt. All things come to an end. I'm not saying this is necessarily coming to an end, just that it's a foolish way to live.

I'm not trying to call you wrong, I'm asking you to show me that what I said was wrong. The fact that on the development and actual application side, Bitcoin is being steered towards being a store of value literally means that the developers are not attempting to make it a medium of exchange. There is a bigger picture, of course, in which Lightning Network and other solutions complete the puzzle. These solutions have nothing to do with Bitcoin transactions currently being expensive, and the fact that is fine with transactions being expensive, and actively prefers it to alternative solutions.

Just children playing along with a joke. Very weak reason for us to believe there's a conspiracy at play.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:07:45
Very ignorant to call market movements 'pump and dumps'. Also very ignorant to call supporting BCH an 'attack' on BTC, same way calling supporting anything is not necessarily with the intent of attacking the opposite. You have to realize that there are also people who simply believe even if BTC &gt; BCH, that BCH is undervalued, and are simply trading to profit from the movements of the market.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:36:49
Happy to agree it's nonsense, but show me how. I am not, and was not, in any way endorsing bch or speaking against btc. Fairly clear that you haven't even read what I've said though.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:48:06
Thanks for your kind words :).
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:40:50
LOL rich. Nothing I've said could be considered shilling by any definition, but your downvote armies are cute.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:30:57
Genuine curiosity - how is this FUD? It's well accepted that transaction fees are that high. You're not helping the community by responding like this. There are plenty of crypto newbies coming in every day, and this is their first stop. The least we can do is make them aware of the situation and help them maximize their experience. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:56:01
Correct me then please? Frogolocalypse didn't seem eager to help me at all, but you can read through the other thread and show me what I'm doing wrong, so that I can be a better support in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:31:07
It doesn't matter what you like and don't like. Factually, both BTC and BCH are separate forks of the original Bitcoin chain, with BTC maintaining the title as it is the longest chain. Doesn't matter whether the shorter chain is called Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Fork 1 or BCash - it doesn't make it a scheme, scam or 'misdirection', and childishly calling it so only serves to make Bitcoin and crypto seem less legitimate, and hurts everyone involved.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:02:35
How is that what I'm saying at all? I'm saying that my understanding was that Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is not intending on being a medium of exchange, but that this functionality will be provided with the technology that is being developed as an additional layer on top of it. You're saying that I'm wrong, and I'm explaining what my understanding is, and requesting that you explain my error to me, so that I can learn. Why are you avoiding addressing anything I'm saying and throwing out a challenge tangent when I'm clearly not even trying to argue or show disagreement?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:33:18
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the official position is that Bitcoin (BTC) is not intended to be a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:48:38
What is the scheme? As far as I can see, there are 2 different coins doing 2 different things, with different plans for the future that are supported by different people, who are all welcome to put their money wherever they want.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:04:19
Can you direct me to where I can confirm this? Everything I've found in the past 6 months has been pretty clear about intending to be a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:01:34
Feel like people are saying this every 6 months. If you're investing because you believe in the technology, then you'll know there's still massive room for growth
