Yes - However you should also factor in the potential new revenue going to come in. However you are right that's the stock is currently overvalued - but this is just a buying frenzy.

How will square compete when bitpay and coinbase can offer 0% fees?

Hopefully soon, have not purchased a trezor but will as soon as Electrum release is out.

I would like to know if there is chip and pin on the cards.
Using it in a shop and needing to sign a receipt in the UK will look funny as everythings chip and pin.
It may even cause hassle with shop owners who think your trying to pull a fast one with a bitcoin debit card.

I don't think you can value BTC securities with traditional methods. 
With this opinion you could have a situation where a mining stock could potentially be paying out dividends that are not far off the price of the share.
If BTC hits $10,000 for example, will the share price fall to accommodate what people value the company in dollars? 
What if the company is also holding 5% of the mining market and paying out 1260btc to the shareholders weekly.
You are much better of calculating the share price from the weekly dividend paid. Rather than thinking about fiat valuation imo.

So I will pay £4 monthly for use, and as long as I use chip and pin within the UK and not withdraw from ATMs it will be free?
Not to bad but could be much better!
50p to change my pin!

I need to find a company for university coursework that has an external threat and then analyse if the companies strategy takes into consideration the threat.
I think I just found that company.

That's class.
Kind of shows why there was never investment in any tech companies.

This seems very interesting. I have been looking for a project I could work on in the bitcoin space. I will be looking into this more. If anyone else is as interested give me a message and we can see where we can take it.

OK thanks for the reply.
Any idea when Electrum will release a compatible version?
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:32:16
I agree much tougher environment now.
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:34:41
Any idea on full trezor release date?
@_date: 2014-04-29 08:35:11
Correct me if i'm wrong, but is this not something that could be created using Etherum?
Edit: A decentralised platform such as Airbnb.

Thank you for your fast response!
I look forward to using the card in the future.
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:43:39
Very informative and interesting video. Well done.

Awaiting Electrum 2.0, still.

Yes, its not so much about the bitcoin stamp than to warn people that there is potentially bad pills going about.
There was the same sort of articles about red mortal combat pills a few months ago.

Heres a question.
I have an Electrum wallet on my Mac that I open from the desktop. Its basically my hot wallet.
If I purchase a Trezor how do I start using it to add extra protection to this wallet?
Does it automatically sync with my wallet?
Could someone please explain.

Fees for the english doubled because you have a Tory Government in place who want to see class division - they do this buy making fees £9,000 a year, which basically means education is based on the ability to pay not academic ability.
So the rich can have an education but the poor will need to go into large debt or just make a living by doing jobs that will be available to them without a degree.
Scotland have free tution because as we have devolved parliament that safeguards our education from Westminster policy making. The fact that Scotland is a much more left leaning country and has a left of centre (SNP) government, is why we have free tuition fees.
The English don't pay for us - it is known fact we put more money into the treasury than we receive back. We just choose to spend our 'pocket money' wisely. 
It has been said that if Scotland was to become an independent nation in 2014, it would be written into the country's constitution that everyone has the right to free education.

Is the product shipped directly to me, or to you and the forwarded to me. Also do I need a coinbase account or can I for example send btc fund from my desktop wallet?

The Monarchy are nothing but leaches on our society. While the normal working family are facing cuts to their public services and struggle to make ends meet, this bunch are given an extra 5million a year to piss up the wall.
The media likes to hype up the working class as some sort of dole scrounging and work shy scum. What does this make Lizzy and the rest of the incest litter?
The argument that they bring in tourism is farcical, get rid of them, the palaces and history will still be there. I'm sure they will have enough cash stashed away to go and live somewhere quietly out of sight - and best of all outwith the grapple of our tax revenue.

Thank you very much. I have been playing around with it and it looks great. I have a few more questions and suggestions, I will message them over to you soon.
I would like to agree with the sentiment on this page. This thing could be huge and is a massive innovation. Congratulations.
It should really be at the top of the /bitcoin page

Good work and good luck. 
Hopefully when I make a few more coins I could use btctrip and get a flight over to the sunny side. Could help out if you need someone to work on the marketing/brand development side of the business.
