I watched a lot of interviews with him, he is by far not a tech guy, but he makes sure to grasp the essentials of BTC and crypto as a whole.
He is building a multi million dollar business betting on crypto. He wants to be the "consensys" for Bitcoin so to speak. He often states that he wants to be the binding force between retail, institutional and the crypto world.
Ofc he is in for the money, but he is a strong believer and helps to build out the necessary ecosystem.

He certainly understood that the whole space is super hot right now, eventhough the prices have cooled down in this bear.
Calling a +50% on BTC is not too out of proportion if you ask me.
But what do we know? Could aswell go -50%

the forgetting is the hardest part

Where do you target the hight of the next bullrun?
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:56:02
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:09:50
Also bear in mind that one BTC could be $10,000,000 one day.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:10:41
Y tho?
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:21:36
Hindsight much? 
People like you were screaming "when 100k?" 
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:55:37
Some people really don't understand this. They think adding zeros equals inflation.
Thank you for wording this so precisely

Aaand another "BTC betterrrr" thread. 
Jesus. Everything would've been better than the regime with the bolivar
@_date: 2019-03-17 13:23:58
This thread is full of doo doo
@_date: 2018-10-26 10:54:41
The best way to introduce people to crypto is to actually GIVE them some.
It doesn't need to be much. Just make a wallet together and sent some satoshis to your friends.
Let them download a tracking app/ portfolio app on their phone and they can see their holdings daily.
Worked best for all my friends

@_date: 2019-02-27 20:42:06
You just ignored all the points of the above without elaborating anything...
@_date: 2019-02-24 12:26:23
He is a knob head though. Can't stand him speaking. He stresses words really weirdly

Also it's just in your mind that you want to achieve that round number. 
BTC is divisible.
But it is crazy to know that if you hold 1BTC you are one out of 21million people who could (potentially) hold 1BTC. 
FUN FACT: There are currently 36million millionaires on earth.
@_date: 2018-11-07 07:48:53
lol, I had this exact thought yesterday. Those news articles are getting desperate
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:38:22
So called "shitcoins" will sooner or later die out.
The market will gravitate towards quality eventually
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:34:00
