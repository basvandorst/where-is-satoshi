Yeah and if everyone uses it as a "store of value" and hodls like you're doing, how's it ever going to become a spending medium in the future?
Hodling and using it as a "store of value" hurts bitcoin as a currency. If you truly care about bitcoin as a currency, you'd use it as such.

Well if you're not buying because there's nothing to buy that you'd want, that's a different story. 
I'm just talking about people who still only use USD while hodling bitcoin when they could be using it for things they want. Those people should just be honest and say they're hodling because they're speculative traders, and not because they're bitcoin-currency proponents.

I agree. If people truly want bitcoin to be used as currency, they’d use it as currency. That is, spend it, not hoard it. 
The more people spend bitcoin, the more it will attract other vendors to accept it, and hence the more ubiquitous it becomes. 
I fail to see how HODLing helps any of that. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:32:14
This is exactly what I said before. Those who truly believe in bitcoin as currency will NOT hodl it; they’ll spend it. Those who hodl are just either speculative gamblers or hypocrites. 
And those that tell others to hodl are doing so selfishly to preserve their own portfolio value; they couldn’t give a shit about bitcoin as a technology.

But that is about as unrealistic as flying pigs right? Especially with the crazy volatility. 
Even if it does stabilize one day—which would require government backing and regulation to guard against the flares of speculation—it may do so at a much lower price, maybe even $100, at which time the HODLers will have lost a ton of money right?
Bitcoin’s fiat value doesn’t necessarily grow with its stability and utility as currency. In fact, the two are probably at odds.

This is why I posted [my thread]( to ask if bitcoin had real value or was it just purely speculation. My impression has been that it had failed in its original vision because of some major problems, and it has become just an instrument of speculation. The responses to my thread were interesting but were not convincing enough to change my mind. 
And from the speculation perspective, I thought the same thing—all these posts encouraging others to HODL and “hang in there” did not stem from altruistic supportiveness but from self-interest, persuading others to continue buoying this bubble so that they could retain the value of their own investments. It seems truly like an emperor has no clothes situation that only works if everyone goes along with it.

@_date: 2018-01-31 20:46:44
No, I'm talking about hodling, as it not letting any of it go. I see that as speculative trading. 
With USD, sure I save, but that's maybe 30% of my income a month. I'm spending 70%. I think this savings rate is pretty normal. And I wouldn't call spending 70% hodling. Maybe we just have different definitions.

There are two uses to bitcoin: 1. As currency, 2. As speculative investment instrument. These two are actually at odds with each other. 
This article describes the progress of 1. BTC as currency, which is great—it was the original vision of Satoshi. 
But BTC as speculative instrument is tanking. And it makes sense. BTC was never designed to be a get-rich-quick scheme when it was created by Satoshi. That was an aberration created by human greed and hype, hence bubble. 
BTC was meant to be cheap, affordable, and pervasive—to be SPENT, not hodled for making people rich. 
As that original vision of currency becomes realized, its price will continue to tank. At a low price, the speculative traders will finally leave it alone, people will start spending it freely, and it will finally achieve the stability it needs to be a currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:55:28
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:05:59


That’s the whole problem. When BTC’s only value is what other people think the value is, it has no real value and the bubble will burst sooner or later. People will see through it — they can only be fooled by hype and propaganda for so long.

The true value of the dollar is its CURRENT use as currency. It is backed by the government and regulated, and this very regulation gives a stable currency that serves as the blood of a large economy. No one can HODL onto dollars and drive its price up, so it is stable and useful as currency.

Since human are not psychic, they can only make the best decision they can with the information they have at the time. 
If you live by FOMO instead, and didn't sell then, yeah your coins would have more value now by pure luck, but you'd still be stuck in FOMO, and you wouldn't sell now.
And if it ever goes up, your coins would have more value, but you'd still be stuck in FOMO, and you wouldn't sell still.

Satoshi, while brilliant technically, was unfortunately not an expert in economics. 
Bitcoin, being a finite (and shrinking) supply, is deflationary by nature, and a deflationary asset can never be used as currency. 
People are right when they say Bitcoin is buoyed by hype, that it's basically digital monopoly money. It will continue to be volatile until people see through the hype, which I think won't be for a long time because Bitcoin is hard to understand by many. But after that, it will tank to nearly nothing.
Right now, whales and smaller cunning traders know the scheme of pump-and-dump for which bitcoin is extremely useful. They will hype (pump) and get the gullible to buy, and then sell after it goes up for a while (dump), and repeat this process. They'll take a lot of people's money. 
I believe the losers (money-wise) in the end will be 1. those who mistime the market (buy high, sell low), and 2. those who hodl for too long (until bubble finally bursts and bitcoin becomes worthless). All of those people's money will go to those who really understand what Bitcoin is and how to take advantage of it.

It is paying for votes. They're using monetary incentive to get people to upvote their post, under a disengenuous guise of charity. 
The upvotes are not for pineapple fund — they're for their company, Blockonomics. Pineappe fund gets a trivial amount if they get huge publicity.
I'm downvoting. Votes should not be bought.

Pump and dump and repeat.

Ok... because we know we've all wanted to do that. 
Not a day goes by do I not think: "If only I can transfer $1,000,000 completely anonymously overseas. How much better my life would be."

A currency to replace fiat that you can’t even tell people you have? 
I guess let’s hope one day bitcoin doesn’t get so popular that people can just assume you have it.

Gold has inherent value: 
1. It is beautiful and shapable, thus used in jewelry desired by millions.
2. It is biocompatible and does not tarnish, thus used as dental fillings for thousands of years (even today), saving people from agony, infections and death.
3. It is a highly efficient conductor of electricity and is used in most electronic devices, including cell phones. It doesn't get corroded.
4. Space vehicles are fitted with gold-coated polyester film to reflect infrared radiation and to help stabilize core temperatures.
5. NASA also protects its astronauts using gold. Astronauts’ helmets are covered by the extravehicular visor assembly. The visor is coated with a thin layer of gold to filter out the sun’s harmful rays.
 
Don't compare bitcoin with gold.

Stocks are investments in companies that actually have value (hopefully). They actually create products or services that people want or need.
Bitcoin has no such value because, by being deflationary, it failed in its original vision as a currency. Instead, it only attracted greed and hype, creating speculative bubbles. It encourages HODLING, which is by definition NOT SPENDING, which defeats the purpose of a currency. Bitcoin is a failed product and will kill itself. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:37:42
That’s actually not true. They take your money when THEY sell. The money that you’ve put into the pool—it is now in their pocket, and their btc is now back in the pool.
If everyone sold but you, you’d be left with a pool that contains valueless btc (including yours) and no cash.

Yes, and yes lol.

If you're the type of person who needs money (i.e. not filthy rich), and you put a lot of money in it, there's no way you can just "forget about it" for 3 years.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:08:10
IMO, no, it has not hit the bottom. Bitcoin is deflationary and therefore can never serve its original purpose of being a currency. It can only be a speculative instrument (aka gambling). 
Right now, two things are keeping it afloat: 
1. Novelty. Because it's so complicated and technically novel, laymen are still wrapping their heads around it and latching on in the process.   
2. Pump-and-dump whales. Speculative instruments, where value is based on hype, are very easy to manipulate by the big fish. All they have to do is flex their buying power, in addition to hiring shills. You can see signs of this by how the media has done a 180 in the tone of their articles. 
But both of these buttresses will disappear eventually: The novelty will wear out, and the whales will see diminishing returns on their pump-and-dump cycles (skinning the small fish in the process),  and will move on. 
Bitcoin has little use if it's not a currency. Its volatility and speculative power is its own undoing. And having little use, it won't be worth much in the end.

You're free to believe what you wish, but I'll leave it up to someone else to educate you on inherent value. You can also try its synonym, intrinsic value.

@_date: 2018-02-05 17:40:38
Exactly. I asked a while ago "what is the true value of bitcoin?" If it's not valuable as currency, then its only value is as an instrument of speculation, making it as unstable as the capricious whims of the public. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:47:47
Nah I have a pretty bad memory. Pretty sure I'll forget.

So you're basically using monetary incentive to get people to upvote your post, under a disengenuous guise of charity? 
The upvotes are not for pineapple fund — they're for your company, Blockonomics, right? Pineapple fund gets an absolutely trivial amount ($100) if you get huge publicity (10,000 votes)?

This is actually the perfect analogy because to get out of there, you need a running start. 
Bitcoin had this in 2nd half of 2017 because of the superhype and everyone suddenly hearing about it. But can btc get another one?
