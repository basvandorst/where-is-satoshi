I think this area has the largest potential for growth. Projects like Lisk, Ark, and Stratis all provide tools for building on top of blockchain technology, it only takes the first "killer app" built on one of these platforms to skyrocket it into popularity.

I think another important thing to note is that TONS of BTC out there are gone forever because of lost private keys. some early wallets have insane balances in them from when BTC was $0.02, and those will never be available to use gain. so actual usable distribution may not be as bad as it seems. also some huge balances are for exchanges or mining pools, which will be distributed back eventually and are only temporarily in a massive wallet

I really like the sound of that, paving the way for more languages/tooling in the future

Unfortunately the crypto space is full of scams atm. People are the problem not the technology, and every company involves people.

One issue, at least in the US, is that banks are "too big to fail". Banks can essentially do whatever they want, because they have so much money and lobbying power that they can get out of most court cases. If they do something stupid and run into issues, the country relies on them so much that they get bailed out with taxpayer money. There's no way for them to fail because we're too reliant on them and they have too much power.
The US Great Depression happened because when people went to the bank to withdraw, they simply got the response of "sorry, your money is gone forever". If you use Bitcoin, nobody has your money but you (as long as you have your own wallet), so it's impossible for someone else to just say "your money's gone now" since *only you* can control it.
