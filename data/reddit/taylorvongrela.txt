Oh I'm certainly not bashing the voting.  I just think that reporters should 100% not be using the voting scores as determinants of what comments to include in their actual story.  It's one thing for them to peruse comments to get a sense of what the community is thinking and feeling, but it's an entirely different thing to blindly use a comment in their story because they think it's "highly vetted" because it has a bunch of upvotes or downvotes.  That's just shitty reporting.

It seems to be one of the main points of Reddit and differentiators to a static forum.
Except for the fact that you're not factoring in who is voting and what their level of knowledge is.  Voting doesn't declare who is correct or incorrect.  It will only tell you who the general populace believed to have a more convincing argument.  For that to actually mean something, every person voting needs to have a strong knowledge of the matter at hand to be able to weigh in with their vote.  Otherwise it's just like asking a bunch of random people to choose sides.  I believe you're wildly overestimating the intelligence and understanding of redditors.




This is exactly my point!  What if Adam Back was incorrect and the generic reddit person was correct?  Reddit would still upvote Adam Back because they know him and trust him over a random redditor.  The voting means nothing unless you have an educated populace.  As a corollary, this is why Donald Trump is the leading republican candidate currently.  If you don't have an educated populace, they will vote for whatever sounds best or whatever triggers their emotions most.  People don't vote in like this is a scientific journal for review.  They vote with their emotions.
I will say though that the second example you provided is sound.

No source really necessary.  itBit has basically the same business structure and offers the same services, and they also have OTC trading, and they opened many months before Gemini was able to launch.  Gemini simply got beat to the punch and did what they do best: talked their book up with little to back it up.

No, I'm saying those things have absolutely no bearing on the SEC approving the ETF. You can argue the comparisons all you want, but the sec will not be holding the same argument because they are not emotionally attached to Bitcoin and its proliferation.  I 100% concede that your points are valid, but the SEC will not. You have far too much faith in the SEC.

Doesn't really matter if the Twins focus on the ETF or not.  The SEC makes the call whether it ever goes live or not.  The Twins could focus every moment of their attention and all of their combined wealth on launching the ETF and the SEC can simply choose to sit on it for as long as they wish.  
Do you honestly believe that the SEC would approve an ETF that seeks to track the price of a highly volatile unregulated pseudonymous currency/commodity?  Can you imagine the flack they would receive when retail investors begin pouring their retirement funds into an ETF and then a malicious actor manipulates the underlying bitcoin price at the exchanges to manipulate the ETF price?
The ETF is not going to happen anytime soon, I really hate to tell you that, but it's just not going to happen.  Look at the SEC's track record for approving unique ETFs for new markets if you want an idea of how they handle situations like this.

But you didn't properly use the analogy.  You used two things that are not related and tried to make them related by saying "look, there's a vix ETF with an 85% of the shares sold short".  That doesn't mean that you can simply go and sell BTC and continue selling and shorting BTC into infinity and expect to profit from it.  You are making the large assumption that BTC will simply continue to go down in value into eternity.  That's a very big assumption and one you can't defend.
Also, you didn't provide the specific ETF so I can't even go behind you to check the short interest and make sure you're not making it up.  On top of that, an 85% short interest in a VIX etf would mean that most people felt the VIX would continue declining further, but it's already right around some historically low levels, 12-15 range.  It doesn't really get below 12 pretty much ever.  All it will take is a week of the stock market declining and the VIX will be up over 20 and every one of those shorts will be deep in the red.


No, actually you are specifically talking about a VIX ETF, not VIX futures or contango.  You never mention anything about either of those, so don't try to slide them in now.


Sorry, I didn't know looking at a chart and understanding what it says was such an amazing skill.  It's pretty easy to look at the past 18 months and see the downtrend.  The problem I have is that  you are inherently assuming the downtrend will continue into infinity.  That's irrational and unlikely.  


It's not what you said, it's how you applied it.  Your analogy was bad and your responses to my questions make me think that you don't really know what you're talking about it.  I call it like I see it.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:57:33


How exactly does that tie in to BTC and prove your point though?
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:09:21
The VIX is the CBOE Market Volatility Index, which measures the implied volatility of S&amp;P500 index options.  A VIX ETF should be basing its price on the VIX itself (or on the daily changes in the VIX times a multiple rate such as 2x or 3x, etc) or it's not a VIX ETF.  
To remind you, your original comment was an analogy between selling BTC now and shorting it into eternity, and a VIX ETF that supposedly has 85% of the shares sold short (which I'm really skeptical of to begin with.  I'm betting you mean 85% of the DAILY FLOAT, not total shares, but oh no that's not an important point at all).
You made a crap analogy and I called you out on it.  You then made a comment saying "VIX ETFs go down and down and down in price, and so does bitcoin."  That showed me that you really don't have an understanding of the underlying factors behind the VIX, or you wouldn't have made a statement like that.  When I told you that you didn't know what you were talking about, you started bringing up futures contango.  Futures contango is an entirely different concept and there are a lot of other factors that come into play between futures and a VIX ETF.

Not trying to rain on anyone's parade, but this is just a rehash of the same interview that came out last week, and even that was just a NASDAQ exec "talking their book".  It benefits NASDAQ to be the first exchange to have a Bitcoin-centric ETF, so obviously they are going to be positive about the whole thing.  However, that does not mean that the ETF is going to get approved by the SEC anytime soon.  All these articles keep saying the ETF "could" be approved by Q4, but they're just speculating.  The SEC is notorious for sitting on new ETFs for as long as the please.

I disagree with your assessment because I feel it's flawed.  Demand for BTC can certainly go up because people think they might get rich from it (see the early 2013 bubble and crash), but you can't get rich from just buying BTC, not yet at least.  It's still difficult to use BTC in your regular life as a currency for most applications, so it's not like you would be able to take your $500K Bitcoin and start paying for services with it.  You would have to buy in the runnup, and then sell at the peak to actually make yourself wealthy.  But everyone can't buy in the runnup and sell at the peak.  That's a bubble and crash scenario, not a sustained wealth scenario.  Some people would make a lot of money, but others would lose fortunes.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:21:54
Well, think about how arduous the election process still is here in the US.  Despite all our technological advances, we still have a lot of polling places using physical cards that have to be punched (remember the "hanging chads" of the Bush vs Gore election?) and counted by machines.  Granted they are slowly being replaced by more modern electronic machines, but even those machines are not as efficient as a blockchain election would be.  
Recounts? Why do you need a recount? The blockchain is the blockchain.  There's nothing to recount.  The results are final, and would be known very quickly.  None of this "Ohio is too close to call, will take a few days for a recount" crap.  They could structure it to be a blockchain that had hard forks based on precincts and districts so that votes could easily be counted for both local and national elections.
Also, it would eliminate the whole "You HAVE to have a government issued ID to vote" movement that has been a hot topic of debate the past few years.  Instead of adopting a law that could possibly exclude minority voters, a blockchain election would force everyone to have their own private key in order to vote.  It would also allow for voting to be from anywhere. 
Wait, voting could be done from anywhere, you say?  Imagine the voter turnout if you could vote from your couch...

Yes, I could tell that from the article because it closed with "Developers: get started by requesting a BlockCypher token and reading our documentation."  
But that's what I'm saying is the issue:  They have a headline that made me think I'd be reading an article about a development with the blockchain or the bitcoin protocol that would "break the 10 minute confirmation barrier".  Instead, what I got was an article written by BlockCypher that was basically an ad for your product.  I have no qualms with your product at all.  It's great.  However, I'd rather it have been presented right up front as "BlockCypher: a new technology that will allow companies to confirm transactions in mere seconds with 99.9% confidence".  The article makes me feel like I got baited into reading something very different than what I thought I was going to read.

Yes, that was my thought as well, that the "over-secure" nature of the bitcoin network would be mitigated by growth of transactions and Bitcoin itself.  At this point, people aren't racing to launch mining operations, and it's likely that many smaller miners will give up entirely, so I don't think that this is a long term problem.  It's just something that exists right now.
The author obviously understood that comparing the current architecture to Visa/Mastercard was a stretch, but it certainly puts the mining network into perspective of where they will need to get to cost wise for Bitcoin to be more efficient.  
Edit: However, I felt like his point about economies of scale pushing mining towards centralization was a VERY key point.

Here's the thing, you can't just short stocks without paying a borrow for the shares you're shorting.  If "banks" start naked shorting en masse to drive the price down, then the borrow rates will skyrocket, and suddenly it won't be a profitable trade to short the ETF.

Nope, I disagree.  You're condensing what is happening over the past week down into one simple sentence, and that's just not right.  First, while Bitcoin has show dramatic price gains over the long term (+3 years), it's still down significantly YTD in 2014.  On the other hand, the traditional US stock markets have been on a tear for over 2 years, and have been hitting new all time highs in the past months.  
A pull back from all time highs is healthy.  A bounce from $275 to $400 is a great bounce, but you're still down over 50% from the all time highs that were hit less than a year ago.

You hit on a key issue that Bitcoin faces:  Cryptography and cryptocurrencies are complicated ideas.  It takes a fair amount of reading and research to have a good understanding of Bitcoin and the blockchain.  This is something that the average person just doesn't care about at all.  So yes, I think you're correct in that if you try to explain to someone the intricacies of Bitcoin, you're going to lose them very quickly.
People just want to know what it is, what it does, and why they should use it. The "what it is" and "what it does" is difficult to properly illustrate for people, in my experience, so I've stopped trying to go the technical route entirely.  When someone asks me to explain bitcoin to them, I don't lead off by talking about the technology. Instead, I lead off by asking them a few loaded questions.
"Do you remember what the internet was like in the mid-1990's?  Do you remember the first time you used email to communicate with someone via the internet?"
I'm setting them up to think about the way an emerging technology changed &amp; shaped their lives less than 20 years later.  It doesn't really matter if they actually have an answer for my questions, the point is that you've shown them how a fledgling idea can grow to become an integral part of everyone's daily lives over time, that a concept like Bitcoin can eventually grow to become a "currency of the internet".
And that's how I lead into the "What" bitcoin is question:  It's a currency for the internet.  I harken back to the email and internet reference and ask them what the internet would be like if we had never built email, and people still had to call each other using traditional land lines and cell phones routed through the commercial telephone system.  I then compare that to eCommerce on the internet today.  We're still using a legacy payment system that worked fine for what we had in the past, but now we're all purchasing more and more things directly from merchants via the internet.  Yet we're still using the same legacy payment systems we've had since before the internet to make payments online.
I then transition into all the data breaches that companies endure, and remind the person how much data they are unknowingly distributing out into the world, and that they are blindly trusting major companies to protect that information, but often those companies can't protect the information.  With bitcoin, you're not projecting your private personal information out into the world.
From there I usually stop and let them ask any questions they have about what I've already told them.  I'll clarify anything they want as granularly as they want.  
After that I'll talk about the blockchain and how it's a pseudonymous (not anonymous) distributed ledger and makes up the meat and bones of why I feel Bitcoin is the next big emergence in economics.  I can take it any direction from here, but typically I will lead off with the concept that we are so early on in the development of Bitcoin and blockchain technology that we still have yet to understand all the potential applications of the blockchain in our society.  I try to take as many real world things as I can and layer the block chain on top of them.  Contracts?  They could be entered into the blockchain with a simple transaction, and it's forever recorded there.  Deeds &amp; Titles?  Another thing that blockchain can be used for.  Distributed Voting systems?  Blockchain technology can assist with that.
Only then will I even begin to talk about the most obvious case uses such as remittances and moving assets worldwide.  I try to focus on instilling my own sense of wonder for Bitcoin into them.  It's not enough to tell them what Bitcoin and the blockchain are.  You have to make them see that it's something on par with the creation of the internet.  Something that still is learning how to walk right now, but soon enough it will be walking, then jogging, then sprinting.  Finally, my background is finance &amp; investments, so I'll usually tell them that the potential long term returns for an early investor is exponential due to the fixed supply of coins that will be produced.  There aren't many investment opportunities that come around in life that offer you the chance to make 10X your money, but I think this is one of them.  Most of my friends respect my opinions, and I can convey my thoughts well, so usually my explanations have a positive effect and the person I'm speaking with is left with a new outlook on Bitcoin.  I think I've converted more than 10 people to Bitcoin believers at this point, and it's not a conversation I often have with people.  
TL:DR - Half Life 3 confirmed?
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:37:49
Yes, but I believe that's a temporary effect, as what you're describing is really just weak hands being shaken out, and the existing supply of BTC being moved into fewer and stronger hands.  Fewer hands holding all the BTC means supply would likely be constrained as the stronger hands aren't sellers, and this would likely lead to a reflexive price increase.

He was asking you the question of whether you thought one person was controlling the markets.  He was not stating the point.  He was simply responding to something dramatic with an equally dramatic comment.  
You feel strongly enough about your opinions that you missed the context of his point entirely, and you tried to turn it around to make him look like he was making a ridiculous statement when all he was doing was pointing out that you've made gross assumptions that you cannot support with real facts.  You can only support it with observations of the market place, but you can't actually confirm your position.  Below is what he actually said at the beginning of his comment before he chose to insult you (which was shitty and usually negates someone's argument):


So now I'll ask.  **Do you have any way to prove that the market actions that have taken  place are the same player between exchanges, or even within the same exchange with any degree of reliability?**
No, you don't.  You have observations of the markets, and that's all.

@_date: 2014-12-03 14:40:31
So basically you're asking "what would happen if Bitcoin suddenly launched to a $7.2 Trillion dollar market cap by the end of 2015?"
First, that won't happen.  Bitcoin markets are beginning to quickly replicate many of the features that exist in the traditional financial markets, and that will actually lower the volatility of Bitcoin over the long term.  Second, the price can't just skyrocket without a huge influx of demand.  There wouldn't need to be $7T dollars of new money flowing into BTC, but the number would still have to be well into the hundreds of billions to create that kind of supply/demand imbalance.  
The only way this could actually happen would be if every major fiat currency suddenly had a crisis of confidence, and there was a flight out of hard currency and into physical assets.  BTC would get a fair amount of that capital flight to safety.  In reality, I give this less of a chance to happen than a true black swan scenario.  I think you've been reading too much ZeroHedge.

I felt like it was a well formed criticism of Bitcoin that was still supportive of Bitcoin as a whole.  It was obvious that the author has a strong understanding of Bitcoin and the bitcoin economy, and he wasn't outright damning Bitcoin (as many are wont to do).  Instead, he raised some good points about the current "over-securitization" of the bitcoin economy, that economies of scale naturally move mining towards centralization, and that we could see many companies that have been built around Bitcoin fail in the long run because of unsustainable business models.
Basically, people downvoting aren't reading the article, just the title I chose.

Ok, well I'm talking about the money side of it, not people.  The remaining guy who purchased the other 19 coins has compensated them to leave the market, and he now controls a larger portion of the bitcoins in circulation.  Now extrapolate that out to thousands and thousands of "weak hands" selling their coins and exiting the market.  What you're left with is a small cadre of "strong hands" who now control a large portion of the market supply of BTC, and those strong hands aren't selling coins at the same levels that they bought them from the other sellers at. They obviously believe there's more value in BTC than the current price levels, so they're not going to be selling until they feel BTC is appropriately valued.  So you've got the strong hands holding a larger chunk of the tradeable BTC, and they are unwilling to sell at these lower prices, so the supply is much more constrained now, and any new buyers coming into the market will have to pay up to purchase their BTC.  This would cause the price to rise again until an equilibrium was reached where the strong hands felt BTC was appropriately valued, and some of them would return to selling a portion of their holdings.  
You follow?
Example:  The weak hands get shaken out over the course of January 2014 to September 2014, and the price moves lower as expected.  Bullish news occurs (pick your poison: COIN etf launches, Amazon adopts bitcoin, etc) and there's a rush of people wanting to move back into the market, but now there are a lot less people willing to sell their coins because they've been consolidated into the strong hands, and they ain't letting go.  That's a perfect setup for a large ramp in price.

As a moderator of another subreddit, I am ok with what the mods at are doing.  The subreddit I am a moderator of is puny in comparison (has 333x more subscribers).  The sub I moderate has 7 active moderators and 1 or 2 bots that we use.  Even with 7 mods and a bot, moderating can get overwhelming very quickly in a small sub with only 15K subscribers.  
So just to recap:  has over 5 million subscribers, but only 11 active mods and 1 bot mod.  I'll make it a ratio of subscribers per mod:  = 454,545 to 1.  The sub I help mod: 2,143 to 1.
I cannot fathom how the mods at keep anything in check without the use of a bot removing posts like this.  Yes, I think it's a touchy/gray area because they are making a blanket assumption that posts with certain words will not be the type of content that belongs in the sub.  But it would be humanly impossible to manually sift through all of the posts that go up in that sub 24/7.  They would have to have a moderator on the sub at all times, constantly searching the /new tab and rifling through posts just to keep up.  It's just not a reasonable expectation to have of any mod of any sub.  It's impossible.  
Let me give another example:  In the sub I help moderate, there will frequently be 5 or 6 posts a day that are about the EXACT same topic, with the exact same questions or information.  Because we're a small sub, the mods are able to work together to remove duplicate postings so that the sub remains clean and the discussions don't get fractured into multiple different posts.  Now take that normal exercise and apply it to a sub the size of and all bets are off.  I bet when a story breaks they get 20 or 30 posts in an hour that are all focused on the exact same news or insight.  And I imagine that happens all the time.
I think the biggest job that mods have is to uphold the integrity of the sub itself.  What I mean is that as a sub grows in users, it starts hitting levels that are sort of like a point of no return.  When you're really really small, it's easy to moderate and everything that gets posted is good content because its the die hards that are posting.  Then you get into the thousands and you've still got the diehards, but you've also got an influx of newer participants who haven't learned all the details yet.  The quality of the posts and comments begins to decline a little because the knowledge base is diminished by the newer subscribers whose knowledge isn't on the level of the diehards.  That's all fine and dandy, just a natural course for a sub.  It's when you start getting into the 10's of thousands that suddenly the integrity of the sub isn't the same as it was when it was a small sub.  The sub begins to move away from what its foundations were.
That's a moderators real job.  To keep the sub true to its foundations, and to uphold the sub's integrity.  So I'll close with a kudos to the mods for keeping the wheels on that thing.  I'd have probably lost my mind somewhere around 100K subscribers.

What a joke. What a farce. Take a huge loss in BTC, then convert it all to USD and spread it among all BFX depositors (both USD and BTC), but don't spread the loss among the company accounts... Oh no, let the customer base absorb the entirety of the loss.
Just issue BFX tokens equal to the USD amounts of the loss to remove any possible future exposure to fluctuations in the price of BTC, and then when the price spikes from around $650 to over $1000, they reap the benefits of increased trading fees (revenue) while significantly reducing the actual amount of the losses they have to pay back.
119,756K BTC were stolen. At $650 per BTC, that's approximately $77.8M. At $1000, that amounts to $119.8M. At $1,200, that amounts to $143.7M. At current pricing around $1125, it's $134.7M. By converting the BTC losses immediately to USD values and only honoring the USD value of the losses, Bitfinex avoided repaying over $50 Million in customer funds...
but great job, Bitfinex!

Theymos has made a decision at a very high level that XT is bad, and he's basically trying to force that decision on the rest of the community because apparently Theymos knows what is best for Bitcoin and the community.

While yes, there are some buttcoiners who are true trolls that are going to bash anything bitcoin related, I think you are really generalizing the group.  In reality, most buttcoiners that I have conversations with, once you push past the rhetoric and really get down to their thoughts on Bitcoin, they don't like the *community* around bitcoin.  Bitcoiners can be absolutely rabid enthusiasts, and at face value there's nothing wrong with that. But when you congregate a couple hundred thousand bitcoiners into one subreddit, the euphoria around anything and everything bitcoin related gets pretty ridiculous.  Every development and news item is pounced on and extrapolated to be some amazing thing that is just another sign that Bitcoin is going to take over the world!  Well, that's actually not reality in most cases. That's just the echo chamber and the hope of bitcoiners affecting their thoughts.  When a buttcoiner tries to point that out, they get shouted down by the community.  
Buttcoiners and Bitcoiners are simply two sides to the same coin.  Both groups take a great interest in Bitcoin and tend to be pretty knowledgeable about the protocol and new developments.  It's their approach that differs.  Bitcoiners will focus on the positives because that's that humans do when they believe in something and want it to succeed.  On the other hand, buttcoiners are more pragmatic and see the negatives as well, and they don't extrapolate the positives into something that they aren't.

Half of $2 TRILLION is $1 trillion.  That's the rough amount of FX occurring with the Rupee.  The amount of FX that Bitcoin causes in India would have to start reaching into the 10's of billions of dollars before it would even cause a dent in the actual Rupee FX markets.  All you have to do is compare the size of India's BTC exchanges to the actual FX amounts occurring to see that BTC is like an ant compared to an elephant here.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:02:54
The problem with this theory is that it exists in a vacuum.  It does not account for the large amount of foreign exchange already taking place with the rupee that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  India's GDP is over $2 trillion annually as of 2015, and foreign trade accounted for almost 49% of that amount...
Any FX effect created by Bitcoin on the Rupee would be dwarfed by normal world trade.

None of those news developments actually are affecting bitcoin.  So what if a major corporation adopts bitcoin as a form of payment.  People still have to actually start using bitcoin with that business in large volumes before it will have any real affect.  Same thing with a non-profit paying employees in bitcoin (which, personally, I would flip my shit if my company started trying to pay me in bitcoin).  That's just one company with a small amount of employees, and those employees aren't going to be able to purchase every need with bitcoins.  Most likely they are just going to exchange them for fiat currencies.
You have to be able to sift through all the bullshit noise and realize what actually affects supply and demand of a commodity, such as bitcoin.

Yes, continue to be patient, **but also continue to be persistent** in contacting their support.  Coinbase is responsive to the "high risk" transaction issue, and they will whitelist accounts so that they never get marked high risk again.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:37:21
No offense, but I don't know where you are getting a potential billion dollar valuation from.  I think you're significantly underestimating Coinbase's expense load.  Sure, they probably have positive cash flow, but nowhere near the levels I'd need to see to value the company at a billion dollars.  I would need to see EBITDA of around $20-$25 Million before I'd even considered giving them that high of a valuation, and that would still be 40x EBITDA multiple (that's high even for tech).  There's just too much risk involved in their business model to value them that high right now.
* What if the US Government (or any global power) attempted to regulate bitcoin?
* What if the "CoinValidation" movement takes off and people move away from Bitcoin?
* What if a new US Based exchange and Merchant Servicer crops up and they have a better platform than Coinbase?  Because let's face it, Coinbase isn't the best pure exchange (there's a myriad of issues they need to overcome).
* The bitcoin world doesn't really respect the "First Mover" advantage.  They respect the company that provides the best product and service.  People just ship from exchanges all the time for the next best thing that's been developed.  Can Coinbase keep up with new exchange technologies? I doubt it.
* What if their site gets hacked? Yes, this is applicable to any exchange or BTC company, but it's still a valid concern.  If you lose all your customers BTC, you won't have customers anymore.
I'm not saying these are problems exclusive to Coinbase (they're not), but you have to factor these risks into any valuation.  Honestly though, I'd be really surprised if Coinbase is still considered the gold standard of american exchanges in 12 months time.  Many many other exchanges will launch in that time, and some of them will be very successful.

The problem with these assertions is that they have no basis in facts or evidence.  What you describe as "clear cases of market manipulation" is really just an opinion based on observation.  Do you have trading details or any information that shows this market manipulation?  
It's my opinion that almost all of the highly volatile moves in BTC can be attributed to market panic/euphoria.  MtGox has high lag and the price is falling?  Better sell now!  MtGox has high volume and the price is climbing fast?  Better buy now!

@_date: 2013-07-02 21:03:06
I think some of what you're saying is correct, but other points are off target, so I'll try and go one point at a time.
First, Bitcoin is still a highly illiquid market.  The prices are very volatile because the trading depth is shitty, and a $1.5 Million dollar transaction (only really 15k BTC) can still rock market pricing.  In ETF terms, a $1.5 Million dollar transaction is nothing.  The "Baskets" that the shares will originally be sold into the market in are a minimum of 50,000 shares (which is close to a million in USD).  So this ETF will have crappy liquidity for a while.
You are correct that short sellers have to pay a spread % called a "borrow", because they are essentially borrowing the shares from a broker and selling them to another person, and will give the shares back to the broker at a later date.  So yeah, a short seller automatically has a hurdle % to beat with a manipulative trade.  The Borrow rate could be pretty high with this ETF too, probably approaching 10% (borrow's are based on liquidity and demand too).
You commented that it would be difficult to short the ETF in any sizeable amounts because someone could see the trader was building a big short position and attempt to squeeze him/her out by buying up shares in an attempt to drive up the price.  I disagree with this because it's very difficult to cause a short-squeeze single handedly.  Typically short sellers drive their own short squeeze when adverse news comes out and the shorts scramble to cover to avoid heavier losses.  
While the price of the ETF will be market driven, it will still attempt to be connected to the actual daily price of BTC, so it should track reasonably close with intraday movements, but over the longer term it will disconnect due to supply/demand nature.
As for your short selling example, I think you're looking at the market the wrong way.  When a stock is sold short, the short seller is actually selling the stock to the buyer, and borrowing the stock from a broker.  The price of the stock would not be overly affected because of the trader's short position.  HOWEVER, as the trader continued to build his short position, the BORROW rate from the broker would begin to baloon because the broker only has so many shares to loan, and they are taking risk by continuing to loan out their own clients ETF shares.  So the borrow rate would constrict the actual size of the short most likely.
Honestly, I think we will see some real, tangible manipulation moments from the creation of this ETF.  The way the fund is set up, the winklevi's trust gets paid fees on all transactions, so they don't really have much motivation to keep the ETF pegged with the actual price of BTC.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:55:00
"BTC Gained vs if that BTC was held rather than fiat converted"
How would you do that? Are you saying you would compound the dividends over time and compare it against the value of the purchase price of the BTC held over time?  You would need future projections of BTC price to properly determine ROI then. That would defeat the purpose of calculating ROI.
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:08:39
If a depression occurred in the US, bitcoin would have no effect on it whatsoever.  Bitcoin just isn't widespread enough yet to even come close.
A US depression would drag most of the world down with it because we are large consumers and importers.  Europe would lag the US by a year or two, and China would be greatly affected as well.  Basically, as we saw with the recession in 2008, global economies are incredibly interconnected now (at a level never seen or experienced before).  A depression in the US would turn into a depression everywhere.

Well, I can't really comment definitively on market manipulation in BTC.  It's difficult to get much data regarding trading since the main exchanges aren't really very sophisticated or transparent.  However, BTC is an unregulated marketplace.  Market Manipulation would not be illegal here because there's no laws against it and no one to police it.
With that said, I don't think there is any significant market manipulation occuring with BTC, other than maybe some DDOS attacks on exchanges coupled with targeted buying by the attackers.  The things that people scream about as market manipulation around this subreddit are not even close to manipulation.  Sure, BTC markets can be exploited, but I just don't think it's happening.

I stand by my points, which I feel have still not been adequately countered.  I will admit though that most of my argument is to point out the circlejerk that has become.  The comments in this subreddit lead me to believe that most of the users here have little to no experience investing/trading in a financial market.  It is filled with rank speculation and misinformation.  It only contributes to the panic and euphoria we witness in the marketplace.  I do my best to provide a contrary opinion that doesn't leap to conclusions based off of speculation thinly veiled as "facts" or "evidence".  That is all.

It doesn't matter if the decimal place gets moved.  I'll just address the points you made.
-Psychological block of owning less than 1 of something:  You think that's a psychological block?  It's a currency that doesn't physically exist.  **That's** a psychological block. Anyone who actually took a moment to learn about bitcoins would realize that transactions can be done in tiny decimal amounts to account for this.  
-Next point- Why buy less than 1 bitcoin?  Well, getting a bunch of people to adopt bitcoin won't do much if they all go out and buy fractions of a bitcoin.  Those aren't the users you want to attract.  You want businesses to adopt bitcoins as a form of payment.  Then all those little fractional amounts become larger sums as the business takes payments from many customers via bitcoins.  What's holding bitcoin back now is the fact that it is a completely new form of currency that the vast majority of society has not heard of or does not understand conceptually.  What held back the internet in the early 90's?  The exact same issues.  Think of this phase of bitcoin as the early 90's "AOL Online" phase of the internet.  We were all using crappy dialup, slow modems and predominantly just getting familiar with email and websites.  But technology developed and entire sectors began emerging just to cater to the internet and it's emerging user base.
-A stock split style decimal move:  Doesn't apply here because it's a differently structured beast.  You can't own partial shares of a stock.  However, it's perfectly normal to own less than one bitcoin.  The entire structure of bitcoin is setup to handle the growth in value by transacting at smaller decimals (down to a satoshi).  Look at it this way:  Do you think the Japanese should move the decimal place on the valuation on the yen?  Right now, 1 US Dollar is equal to just under 100 Japanese yen.  That's just an exchange rate, just like BTC to USD.  Changing it doesn't change anything, and it certainly won't attract new smaller income users.

Theoretically, yes.  However, if each of the Rig companies kept their rigs for themselves, then the total computing power used to mine for blocks would baloon, and the difficulty of the mining would be increased to counteract the increase in computing power.  
So the rigs would lose value quickly, and each company would have to continue to produce new rigs to gain an edge on their competitors, and the cycle would become self-perpetuating. 
So instead, why not sell the mining rigs to third parties.  You make a tidy sum selling them because they are in such great demand, and as you ship more, the original ones you shipped become worth less and less as the difficulty to solve a block is raised.  By selling the rigs, they have eliminated the problem of self-perpetuation for themselves, and passed it on to their buyers.  Theoretically, by selling them they are actually creating more organic demand for their product.
It's pretty smart business actually.

Here's the thing:  John Lothian is correct.  Take a moment to take yourself out of your own mindset, and view bitcoin from an outsiders/neutral perspective.  We all have rose colored glasses on in regards to bitcoin because we want to see it succeed, and we appreciate all the positive potential it presents as a currency.  It's cognitive bias.
But right at this moment, Lothian's thoughts on bitcoin are correct.  Hopefully he will be proven wrong in the future.

Actually, that's not what is happening, and people need to stop thinking this way.  The government did not just "de facto recognize bitcoin is money".  They had an informant assist them in reviewing the money transfer process from Dwolla to Mt.Gox, and what they found was that the Mutum Sigilum bank account linked to the Dwolla account was not set up to transmit money as a business, and that the CEO of MtGox had 100% incorrectly set up the account.
So what actually happened is that the US Government realized that a US Bank Account was transmitting money on behalf of it's parent company's clients without having the proper account registration with their bank and also with the regulatory agencies.  That's it.  Dwolla does not transfer BTC, only USD.

Yeah, no, that's not how it works.  Trading will not just resume at $120.  There is no price for MtGox now because there is no trading, and price can only be set by a valid transaction.  Trading will reopen with all new bid/ask spread that will reflect what people feel is a current fair price.

Fair enough response.  I always err on the side of polite discourse in situations like that, especially because Dwolla has the right to close your account at their own desire (so the power really lies with them).

You have no idea what you're talking about.  MtGox is beyond the reach of the US Government because they are a Japanese company.

As for the service, I'd have to see how it actually works first.  I'm not sure why an arbitrager would want to provide their services to other people.  The whole point of arbitrage is that if it's easy to arbitrage, then there won't really be a point to arbitrage because everyone would just do it.  So if you create a service that makes arbitraging easy, then theoretically that should cause the prices to move back towards parity, and eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.  Basically, if your service operates well, it will be self defeating.

I use CampBX and Coinbase as my primary exchanges.  The only real downside to CampBX is that they have lower volume than some other exchanges, so that usually leads to a slightly higher bid/ask spread.  But all in all their fees aren't too high, and their execution platform is very nice.  
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:47:39
I hear your sarcasm, but I sort of disagree with your general sentiment.  I think it's just a difference in point of view, though.
Withdrawals have been reopened for a few weeks, and there are multiple verified reports of USD wire withdrawals being processed now(via MtGox's german bank, which to me means they are manually processing them).  So the spread should start coming down as MtGox catches up on the backlog.  As for the "dollar futures" and capital intensive comments, I really don't see it as such.  It's only capital intensive for someone who absolutely needs the money right this instant, and if someone really needs the money that quickly, then I would suggest that they stay away from bitcoin investing, or any investing for that matter.  Like I said in my original post, a 14% return in one months time is an amazing return in the investment world.  People here in Bitcoin world are thinking about and expecting 200%+ returns, and that's ridiculous from my point of view.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:25:29
Why does that keep you away?  Do you frequently move from BTC to Fiat and actually move the cash away from the exchange and back to your bank account?  That seems excessive.
It's just a one month period from the moment of your first Dwolla deposit to CampBX.  You can't get that money back from CampBX for 31 days that one time only.  After that it's same day transfers forever.  I actually think this is far better than what I had to go through with MtGox to get "verified".

No, not necessarily.  It really comes down to running the numbers internally.  They probably estimated what the old hardware could add to their hashrate, and what estimated return that would generate.  Then they calculated how much they could sell the old hardware for, and what return that would generate.  Then you just do some financial discounting to bring everything back to a present value, and voila, you have the numbers to make an informed financial decision.  Looks like ASICminer went with selling the old hardware now (before more power hits the market and the old hardware becomes even more obsolete, and less valuable).

I have a subquestion to tack on to this (because most people already know the answer to OPs question):  Today I was looking at CampBX's market book, and their orders were hanging right around $98 (consistently).  However, when I was checking my coinbase account, the price could be very different, and fluctuate very quickly.  For one 10 minute period, Coinbase was offering me a sell price of $102, and then 10 minutes later it would offer me a sell price of $97...
It kept fluctuating like that for a few hours.  What would cause Coinbase's buy/sell prices to fluctuate so rapidly?  I was seriously considering some arbitrage.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:22:10


Exactly.  For Starbucks, Bitcoin is a godsend.  They do millions of sub $5 dollar transactions every day, and they likely pay $0.25 to $0.50 for most debit card transactions, and even more for credit card transactions.  If they could get even 5% of their customers to pay with bitcoins, it would be a massive boost to their bottom lines.  Starbucks would be a perfect guinea pig for the first major market player to step up and accept Bitcoin as payment.

There's nothing to discuss.  Someone sold 5-10k of bitcoins which took out the Bids all the way down to $150 (where there was a standing buy of 1k that stopped the decline).

I can't 100% say whether this is correct or not, but I'd guess that the order book just isn't that deep since they don't have much volume.  
For example, look at the clark moody price charting page.  At the bottom they show the MtGox order book.  at the moment if you wanted to sell 10 coins, you could get it done at 119.31. Once you go past 10 coins, the top bid is eaten up and the next bid is at a price of 119.20 (where you can get 3 BTC sold).  My guess is that they just aren't displaying the order book so you're seeing an average price.

Ah, I understand now. For some reason his comment just didn't work in my head.  Yes, banning something typically only increases it's desire in the public mind.  But to my point, alcohol and weed are both well known in the public mindset.  People have divergent views on both, but for the most part, they are all familiar with booze and weed. Bitcoin is still an obscure, new beast that a lot of people don't understand or even know about.  Until the public becomes more familiar with bitcoin, I don't think the Streisand Effect would truly work.  I believe this is partly do to the intangible nature of bitcoin.

Question:  If you're really stressed about getting your fiat out of Mt.Gox, why wouldn't you just move your BTC to another exchange, sell there, and then pull your money out from the new exchange?  Sure, there's a small price gap between MtGox and other exchanges, but that exists because people can't remove their USD from MtGox.  Moving your BTC and selling on a different exchange wouldn't cause you a dramatic loss in money or profits, and you'd be able to get your fiat in quick fashion.

That I agree with.  People who take the time to make their transactions obscured via coin tumblers and general safety/paranoia will be very difficult to track.

Mainstreamers would not put much thought towards hiding their transactions and identity.

I guess I understand the thought behind using the final amount of 21 million BTC, but only if I was trying to estimate potential value 10-15 years in the future when a great deal of the total BTC would have already been mined.  However, only about 55% of the total BTC have been mined currently, and only about 80% will have been mined by 2018 (rough estimates given the problems we are seeing with mining overcapacity).
I still think that assuming all 21 million BTC are in circulation is very risky and should not be used for estimation/valuation purposes.  It would be far more prudent to incorporate the increased supply into your model over time like the system is currently designed.  That removes the assumption that adoption rates will be strong enough to absorb the new capacity in circulation over time.

A former boss/mentor of mine used to say a phrase all the time: "Hope is not an investment strategy."
Now, he was saying that in relation to stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.  What he meant was that due diligence must be done on any investment candidate, and it needs to be incredibly thorough.  Hope should not be a part of the equation. When the due diligence is done, you should be confident in whether or not the candidate is a good investment (and if you're wishy-washy, then it's not a good investment). With that said, doing the due diligence work on Bitcoin is much more complex and difficult because there is far less fundamental data to analyze, but if you really understand BTC, the data is there to be culled from.  
Can you say you've done the due diligence?  Or are you just hoping BTC is successful?

First, I'll start by saying that I've had nearly identical conversations with the few peers I have that do know and understand bitcoin.  We reached the same conclusion that your friend and his colleagues came to.  If bitcoin takes off, it will probably take 5-10 years for it to gain real acceptance, and in that time frame, it's likely the government will figure out a reason/way to regulate bitcoin into obscurity.
As for the Streisand Effect side of your post, I think that bitcoin isn't really going to see a pop from that.  In my opinion, for the Streisand Effect to work correctly the main topic must be something that is already popular or well known in the public mind (for example, it's namesake, Barbara Streisand).  Bitcoin is far from well known or popular to the general public.  We here on lose sight of this because we tend to immerse ourselves in bitcoin news and updates, but my guess would be that probably 95% or more of the general population doesn't know about Bitcoin yet.  I just feel like most people don't care about bitcoin or anything like it because they are generally content with the current state of fiat currency in their daily lives.  The regulation of Bitcoin wouldn't affect them.  Their awareness might be raised, but if they don't really care in the first place, the effect will be minimal at best.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:44:57
Well, let me first say that I hope you are correct, and I am BTC holder because I think there is a small potential that you will be correct.  However, I think the odds are stacked against bitcoin.  
For Bitcoin to be successful, it needs to reach a critical mass (don't ask me what that critical mass is though).  I think it's easy for BTC to seem captivating to people who are already involved in BTC, but to outsiders, Bitcoin is very confusing and shady.  I'm a staunch believer that people don't change much from a behavioral and philosophical standpoint, and a major concern will be giving up their physical, "known all my life" dollar bills and coins for a volatile, cryptographic based currency that you can't actually hold in your hand.
The major hurdle I see facing BTC is not regulation (which is a foregone conclusion.  BTC is not going to replace government control over money. Not in my lifetime, at least.), but actually getting Joe Schmoe from Sioux Falls to understand that BTC even exists, how it functions, and why he should use it over physical money like the US Dollar.  Getting youth to take up BTC will not be difficult because the youth are always ready to adapt to new technology.  The key will be getting the older millenials (26+) and anyone over that age to accept BTC.
The barriers that will prevent people from accepting BTC are just too numerous, in my opinion.  Until new technology and startups crop up that simplify the buying process, secure the holding of BTC, and make transacting with BTC absolutely painless to the average person/business, I don't see BTC reaching critical mass.
Edit:  As for gains, for us to see any sort of gain like the "early adopters" saw, the price would have to rise to over $5,000 USD per BTC.  I'm basing that off of the assumption that an early adopter could have bought in around $5 and sold out around $250 at the top of the bubble.  You could say that I'm using an unrealistic amount for the sellout moment, but that could also be said of my buy-in price, which could have been much lower (think of the return if you had gotten in when BTC was less than $1.00 a coin!?!).
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:03:21
That would depend greatly on what the price of 1 BTC is over time.  Excluding price fluctuations, if the dividend remained .011 BTC per week, it would take about 120 weeks (2.3 years) to recoup the initial 1.3 BTC investment.  
Edit: That's also not accounting for any fees you might be paying on pass through shares.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:23:20
You are totally right that it's everyone's own fault (including my own) for buying into a bubble.  However, absolving MtGox of some blame here is silly.  Their infrastructure has been revealed as a joke and this has effectively made them complicit in the bubble popping.

I understand your frustration with Dwolla, but I also understand Dwolla's point of view as well.  With all of the pressure being exerted on Dwolla and the Bitcoin community by regulations, I understand why Dwolla would want to be heavy handed.  ESPECIALLY after the MtGox account seizure.
Try and look at it from Dwolla's perspective:  They are trying to maintain a successful startup money transferal business (which is already under a lot of regulatory scrutiny without its connection to bitcoin).  Then the Mt.Gox seizure happens.  At that point they probably started really worrying about how their relationship with bitcoin could affect the entire company.  In your specific situation, you were unknowingly breaking Dwolla's terms of service.  The latin phrase "ignorantia juris non excusat" (ignorance of the law is no excuse) applies.  Still, they would have been willing to work with you despite this, but your account got pulled into a fraud investigation because an account you received payment from was hacked/stolen/whatever.  If I were dwolla, I would have shut down your account as well at that point because the risk has become too great (even though you were a great customer for over a year).  
However, I think it's excessive that they then messed with your campbx transfers, which got you banned from campbx as well.  I would continue trying to talk with both Dwolla and CampBx to get your accounts restored.  I feel like CampBX could be persuaded since you didn't break any rules there.  Sorry bout your troubles, though.

But would it?  Is that really how the price of a share fluctuates?  No, seriously, I really don't know. I'm not very familiar with ASICMINER and the shareholder system.
My finance perspective would think that the price of a share is actually tied to the value of the dividends. If the value of BTC went up, then your dividends would be worth more as well, which would make owning the shares more valuable and demandable, hence a higher share price.

You're being paranoid.  The IRS is not actively tracking your withdrawals from MtGox or your bank accounts.  There's nothing illegal about withdrawing your money. It's YOUR money.  
However, if a portion of that $1,000 is considered profit from an investment, then you are subject to short term capital gains tax just like any other investment.  Pay your taxes and there is nothing to be worried about.

No, Gold has physical applications and industrial applications.  It has real intrinsic value.  You don't physically make things with dollar bills or BTC.  That's what I would distinguish as "intrinsic value".  However, that doesn't mean that I necessarily disagree with you.  Instead, I feel like the concept of Fiat and intrinsic value is becoming outdated with the advent of new digital crypto-currencies.  One could argue both ways that BTC has no intrinsic value or that the intrinsic value lies in the protocol itself.  Both arguments would be valid.

I agree that if Bitcoin continues to prosper that it will likely grow in acceptance by several orders of magnitude.  That's just logical.
However, I would like to talk a little more about major businesses accepting BTC in tandem with how you touched on future bubble &amp; burst scenarios.  I think one of the biggest factors keeping a major company like Amazon, walmart, etc from accepting BTC is the repeatable Bubble &amp; Burst that we've seen in BTC multiple times.  Companies want stable revenue streams that are reliable.  For BTC to be taken seriously and adopted by the business community, we would need to see fairly long periods of price stability versus major global currencies.  A company that earns revenue in the millions of USD in a single day won't tolerate a commodity like currency that fluctuates wildly.  There's just too much currency risk, and the accounting would become more complex.  On top of that, how would a company of that size hide their BTC account structure from competitors or malicious threats?  All transactions would be visible on the blockchain, and the company would have to institute a very thorough plan just to conceal their financial transactions (and they would because no company wants to reveal any data like that to their competition).
So yeah, those are just some of the major hurdles that a company looking to adopt BTC would face.  A lot of people can't fathom why a major company wouldn't want to accept BTC as a form of payment. I, on the other hand, have a hard time understanding why a major company WOULD want to accept BTC as a form of payment.

I think we are no longer "early adopters" in the sense of a meteoric rise in the price of BTC.  That period is over, and to have participated, you needed to have purchased BTC earlier than May 2011 (though you would have also been able to purchase between November 2011 and May 2012).
In my opinion, we are now in what I'll call the "early implementation" phase.  During this phase price gains will be muted in comparison to the early adoption phase.  What will drive returns for this group is the ongoing uptake and implementation of Bitcoin worldwide.  The more businesses and individuals that begin using BTC, the more valuable the currency will become.  I think this next year or two will be the most critical times for BTC.  Ok, so we've captured some of the tech world and cryptography community.  BTC needs to begin capturing normal people and businesses now.  Now we need all the BTC startups to show up on the scene and make transacting in BTC simple, easy, and as secure (or more) than traditional banking.
If we don't begin to get the regular, average joe community into BTC in the next year, BTC will fizzle out and fade away.

In reality, I'm on OP's side, and I agree with what he's generally saying.  But you can't talk in absolutes.  Bitcoin has already seen issues arise (and then be dealt with).  To say that a coin will never ever be counterfeited, well, that's a bet that i'm willing to take the other side of.  Because when the concept of money is involved, people will always try to find ways to counterfeit it.  And someone will eventually succeed (and then the protocol will be adjusted to prevent that exploit going forward.  Hence the beauty of bitcoin).
@_date: 2013-09-11 19:07:55
haha practically anything.  Basically, they have an algorithm running behind the scenes that flags transactions.  It seems to be fairly arbitrary and heavy handed in flagging transactions.  HOWEVER!  If you do manage to have a transaction flagged as "high risk", you can reach out to coinbase support and they will go into your account and force the transaction through at the original transaction details rate.  They will "white list" you after that to make sure you don't get flagged again.  
Coinbase does not have a large support staff though, so it can take a week to get a high risk transaction sorted out sometimes.

300k USD is approximately 2500 BTC, so definitely a market moving amount if purchased/sold all at once.  You'll have to attack this problem in stages, so I'll take the answer in stages as well.
First, you need to get that 300k USD from a bank account to an exchange.  With an amount that large, you'll want to only work with a reputable, higher volume, safe exchange.  In my opinion, your only options are to move this money via ACH Transfer, or a wire transfer.  ACH will be the cheapest route, and take several days to complete, but it's safe.  Wire transfer will be very quick and safe, but the fees could be fairly high.  Some banks charge a flat fee while others charge a percentage of the total transfer amount. You'd need to see what your current bank charges in regards to a wire transfer.
You'll probably have to go the wire route because I don't think many major exchanges allow ACH transfers for deposits (typically only withdrawals).  
So now your money is at an exchange and you need to buy BTC.  That's the easy part.  You're going to pay a set commission amount on the total $ amount of your trades (probably would average out to 0.4% on MtGox or BTC-E.  Note that MtGox only charges the commission when you purchase BTC, while BTC-E charges the commission on both buying and selling.)  So at this point you've probably paid a wire transaction fee (based on your banks rate), and you've paid 0.4% commission on converting your USD to BTC and then back to USD/EUR.  
Now you have to transfer the money out of the exchange and into your bank account in EUR.  You're going to pay the same wire fee that you initially paid, or you could possibly avoid this by setting up ACH transfer.  BTC-E offers SEPA transfer into any Euro area bank (and this is typically free I believe).  So if you take the time to do this right, you may not pay any fees on the outbound transfer.
So, if all goes well, you'd have to pay the initial wire fee and the trading commissions.  You could move your BTC to BTC-E and sell the coins there, and initiate a SEPA transfer to the bank account of your choice. From looking at [this list of US Bank wire fees]( it looks like you could move the money to a US exchange for around $25, or internationally for about $50.  My best guess is your total cost on the 300k would be about $1,250.
The downsides:  First, you're opening yourself up to currency risk because BTC is inherently risky at this point.  You would have to stage out your purchasing and selling of BTC over the course of a few days so as not to move the market price through your actions.  During that period the price could move and you may lose (or gain) a portion of your funds.  Second, you're probably going to have to deal with exchanges that don't handle volume and transfers on your level very much.  They will be wary of your transfer and its purposes.  I would most certainly contact any exchange you plan to deal with before hand and explain to them exactly what you would like to do and if they will assist you throughout the process to ensure that everything is set up correctly.
That's all I've got for now.
TL-DR:  The initial wire transfer and trading fees will likely cost you about 0.4% of the total 300k (~$1,250).  SEPA bank transfer to a Euro area bank account in EUR would be free.  Speak to any bank or Bitcoin exchange you intend to deal with BEFORE diving in to make sure they can handle your needs (both from a liquidity perspective and a general competence perspective).

I hear you, but I just don't think that's what is causing this price movement.  I only know a handful of currency desks that are actively trading BTC, and they are not trading it because they see BTC as a safe investment.  They are trading it because it's easy to rake in gains when volatility is high.
There may be a select few small professional investors moving more into BTC, but the volume just isn't there to tell me that big players are coming in.  If pro's were taking risk off the table and moving into BTC, We would see way more volume.  MtGox is showing less thank 40k BTC traded today.  That's not even $5M USD.  That's nothing.

Of course, but OP is talking about actively saving via BTC.  That would infer he is further contributing to his current amount of savings at current pricing levels.

What do you mean by "except when it doesn't"?  As for the rest, I agree that technical analysis is basically for the birds in most situations, and fundamental analysis should always be the go to.  But like one of my earlier comment's edits states, there really isn't a good way to do fundamental analysis on Bitcoin (not like a traditional currency at least).  So in the absence of fundamental analysis, technical analysis will have to do.  Also, technical analysis can be a useful tool when looking at shorter terms such as OP's analysis.  
You took my rubber band analogy a little too literally.  I was just trying to illustrate how trends tend to be mean reverting, and that when a correction occurs, it typically falls too far to the downside before recouping some of the losses and stabilizing.  I think today's price movements have been a good example of that.

While your words here have not defamed CampBX, in the event of lawsuit brought against their company, they would very likely file countersuit alleging defamation.  It doesn't matter that the countersuit would be baseless.  It's about the fact that you're just one guy, and you likely have less resources to finance an extended lawsuit.

No matter what, Starbucks would still be paying the interchange fee, and likely a small percentage or flat fee on top of that aka "Interchange Plus".

This argument is thoroughly oversimplified, and can't be widely applied.  If a company was selling light bulbs that lasted 100 years, they would charge far more for that light bulb than the bulb that lasts 5 years.  Otherwise they would put themselves out of business after a couple years because no one would continue to buy their products because no one would need to buy new lightbulbs for generations.  The price difference between a 5 year bulb and 100 year bulb would have to be very significant.

I don't think you'll be able to ask for physical delivery of bitcoins via this ETF.  And even if you did, they will only redeem in "basket" amounts, which are 10,000 BTC each.  
Yes, this ETF will open up Bitcoin to widespread manipulation.  I should state clearly that I am not one of the ignorant people who hang around here screaming "Manipulation!" every time the price jumps or drops.  That's just natural market action.  But with this ETF, it's hard for me to believe that people won't actively manipulate the market to drive the price of the ETF.  
Example:  The ETF will be shortable.  It would be very simple for a large trader to sell short a large block of the ETF shares, and he could even do so on margin.  After he has amassed his large short position, he could dump 10k BTC at the market price and drive down the price of BTC significantly.  The ETF price would follow the physical BTC price, and the trader could exit his leveraged short having made a substantial profit on his market manipulating trade.
This is a major concern for me, and I don't think the community realizes how exploitable this is yet.

and here's the comment from &gt; Happy to address this.
Our goal with this piece was to collect disparate data points to empower the many concerned market participants to determine their own comfort level around Mt. Gox’s liquidity position. After quite a bit of time spent on this, the final executive decision to pull it was based on the room for potential misinterpretation.
The main takeaways from the piece were as follows: *The data suggests Mt. Gox’s total expenses and frozen funds are likely larger than their lifetime fiat revenue, but questions remain about how they’ve managed their significant BTC revenues. The piece outlined three potential scenarios, though there could be nearly infinite alternatives. Again, the goal was to show how one could use the data available to make a determination of their own comfort. *The withdrawal hiatus is likely caused by what Mt. Gox stated - problems with traditional banks. What they didn’t mention is that the root cause of those problems was almost certainly the account seizures. Warrants are a matter of public record, but they may have been advised not to comment on a pending legal case, resulting in confusion and panic in the market. *Most US banks are unlikely to open an account for a company under federal investigations. Knowing that's probably the cause of the withdrawal hiatus, its unclear how they plan to resolve the issue. *Mt. Gox has been an integral piece of the incredible bitcoin story for a long time. The next phase of the market will call for vastly different management tactics than have worked to date. Namely transparency, proactive PR and statements from professional auditors would help them sustain the business they've worked so hard to build.

The Nikkei was up +80% since Oct-Nov of 2012!  A 7% drop is a joke in comparison to that move.  Perspective: People lose it around here.  Plus that move had a very minor effect on the US markets.  Today's trading in Japan was volatile as well, but the market still closed in the green there.  
Cyprus was an isolated macroeconomic event.  That actually did affect BTC, and for good reason.  That is still the most ridiculous banking fiasco I've witnessed in my life.
Technical movements aren't necessarily gradual or rapid.  It was just a pattern that I have been looking at for a week or so since the price was finally consolidating at a stable rate around the $120-$125 levels.  I had been sitting in fiat but decided to move back into BTC earlier this week in anticipation of a technical move in the late week.  In this case, I was correct.  But things could have easily gone against me as well.  It doesn't take much money to move the price of BTC.

MtGox's price is higher because they recently had a moratorium on USD withdrawals.  So if you wanted your money out of MtGox in USD, you were forced to purchase BTC at MtGox and then transfer it to a seperate exchange to sell.  This artificially inflated the price at MtGox and lowered the prices at other exchanged.
MtGox has lifted the moratorium on US Withdrawals, but they still have a 2 week backlog in processing withdrawals, so the price difference still persists.

Well, your story is light on details, so I'm not ready to condemn CampBX yet.  
However, I would recommend that you retain a lawyer in the Atlanta metro area, and file suit against BulBul.  I would also contact the better business bureau in Atlanta to file a complaint.  If you go this route, I'd delete this post and any other defaming comments you may have made regarding CampBX or BulBul to ensure that they would not counter for defamation.
If you haven't tried calling them directly yet, this is their number: (510) 545-3987.  But at this point, I would not contact them without a lawyer present (if you're really intent on getting your BTC back without trading out).
Edit:  Additional thought - the issue you are dealing with could very well be Dwolla related since you used Dwolla to deposit your USD.  It's conceivable that the size of your transfers raised a flag at Dwolla, and Dwolla then instructed CampBX to freeze your BTC pending internal investigation.  Dwolla is really the power holder in that relationship, so CampBX would just follow Dwolla's orders or Dwolla would stop working with them (like pretty much every other exchange).

There's no advantage or disadvantage.  You will either get the price you want, or you wont.  Making your order visible in the depth chart should theoretically have no effect on that.
Now, with that said, if you're placing a 1000 BTC block order and you decide NOT to go dark pool with it, then that large of an order might influence at what price smaller players would be willing to enter their orders at.  Still, the effect would be little, if any.

Actually, either way is perfectly fine.  It's really up to you and your friend.  Some people like getting monthly dividends, and others just want their investment to grow.  Is your friend financially well established?  Example:  Say your friend is heading to work one day, and suddenly his car breaks down and it's going to cost him 3 grand to fix it.  Is he going to need his money back from you to be able to fix his car, or is he financially stable enough to handle unexpected burdens like that?
If your friend is financially stable, then I think it would be prudent to have him reinvest profits/dividends each month.  Reinvesting profits is a good way to grow the initial investment, and gives you more financial power to work with.  If he's not financially stable, then you might consider just giving him the profits every month and taking your cut.
One thing to keep in mind is how you would handle months when you have a negative rate of return.  Are you going to give money back to the fund out of your own pocket to share in the losses?  I'd recommend you just carry over negative performances to the next month.  So say you lose 3% of the fund in August, and you stated your hurdle rate is 5% in the above contract.  In that case, an easy way to handle a down month would be to just say that for you to get a cut of the profits in September, you would need to return greater than 8% (normal 5% hurdle + the 3% you lost in August).  If you structure it like that, then you are essentially penalizing yourself for poor months and rewarding yourself for good months.  In comparison, if you had a down month and you didn't carry the negative performance forward by increasing the next months hurdle rate, then you would only be rewarding yourself in good months, but there would be no downside for you when you had a bad month.
Edit:  I should make it clear that you shouldn't give money back into the fund out of your own pocket if you have down months.  I've never known a single professional investment fund to do anything of the sort.

Loving the highlander reference, but I am in the group that thinks BTC will coexist with current economies and currencies.  I don't think it would become the one, true global currency for several reasons.  First, if BTC were to become THE global currency, that would mean that the world (and it's many people, or at least a majority of them) would have had to agree on something.  The human race's track record of agreeing on things is not too good.  Second, existing governments won't eschew their own current currencies for a cryptocurrency that they can't readily control.  It's far more likely that people would be able to transact in both their domestic currency and BTC.
Honestly, for BTC to become the one major global currency during my lifetime, I think there would have to be a global upheaval that took down the world economy, and a political uprising that saw every major government overthrown.

Pretty much exactly what you would think would happen.  The price of gold per ounce would drop sharply based on a large new  influx of supply.  While gold is intertwined with the general economy, in that situation you are creating a supply shock that only ripples through the gold market, so the broader economy wouldn't see much of an effect.
Not part of  your question, but your reasoning in the second paragraph is pretty damn far fetched.  Mining asteroids?  Yes, this has been proposed, but I would guess that it's probably decades off from actually being an achievable enterprise.  Especially in any sort of scale that would effect the global economy for gold.

This is the vaguest and most misleadingly titled post.  First, Japan's stock market didn't "Crash".  The Nikkei was down about 7.5%.  While that is an incredibly large drop for a single trading day, it by no means can be considered a crash.  Consider that since October 2012 the Nikkei has risen by over 80% (prior to the 7.5% drop), and I think we can all agree that the Nikkei didn't crash.
Next you say that European stocks are "falling soon".  Well, that's a pretty broad assertion with no actual data presented to back it up.  Considering most of the Euro area is in a recession, it's not really news that their stock markets are lagging the rest of the world.
Bottom line:  The day to day movements of the stock market will not affect the price of Bitcoin.  People will not flee the securities market for bitcoin because its not considered a safe haven (in fact, I'd argue it's the exact opposite given the historical volatility).

I think you covered most of the reasons in your post, but I'll recap exactly why I think the prices are so divergent at this point.
  USD withdrawals from MtGox are basically still totally fucked.  So anyone who wants their money back in USD from Gox would need to purchase BTC on Gox (boosting the price there) and then transfer the BTC to a secondary exchange that will allow them to remove their money in USD.  They then sell the BTC on the second exchange (which in theory lowers the price on that exchange) and get their USD back.
  CampBX has lower volume, so the Bid/Ask spread is usually much higher than at MtGox and other larger exchanges.  The lower volume/liquidity, in general, is a slight risk, and if people are going to take on more risk by trading at CampBX, then they are going to want a better price as compensation for that additional risk.  So that affects the price as well.
  Typically the other exchanges have been about $5-7 dollars below the MtGox price, but today it's been much further, around $10.  When I looked at the order book on CampBX, I see there is a large sell order pegged at $87.80 (for close to 150 BTC).  That's a big order for CampBX.  That is likely holding the price artificially lower.  However, if MtGox price continues rising and flirts with $100 (currently hanging out around $97), then I think it will cause people to move in and buy up the 150 btc @ 87.80.  That would be a 14% difference in price, and that's just too much.  People will want to arbitrage that, even if it means waiting a month to get their money.  A 14% return in a months time (actually it would be even faster, but I say a month because of the withdrawal time at Gox) is pretty fucking good.

I didn't ask what your feedback said.  I told you why it's wrong to use an average price right now.  You didn't actually refute any of my points, so I'll lay them out more clearly again for you.
* The current system of individual exchanges do not interact with each other.  They are, in essence, isolated from each other.
* Moving money into and out of most exchanges is not a quick, simple process. (Granted some exchanges are easier than others, but for the most part, if you want to move money or try to arbitrage between exchanges, it takes a fair amount of planning)
* Because of the above two points, exchanges must be treated as isolated prices, because thats the only place you will be able to buy/sell bitcoin at those price levels.  You can't go to BitStamp and sell BTC at the Coinbase price, etc.
* The spread between exchanges exists for a known (and fairly obvious) reason:  withdrawing money from MtGox is basically impossible at this point in time.  So the only way for people to get their money out is to buy in, and then move their BTC to a seperate market to sell.  That works to boost MtGox and hold down other exchanges.
* By creating an average price (basically you're just putting together a VWAP for BTC), you are providing people an indication of pricing based on total volume of trading, but it has no real bearing on the marketplace.  It's not a number that you can buy or sell at.  It just becomes another statistic to track.  It may provide some technical analysts with another tool in their toolbox, but at the moment, it would be pretty useless.
Now, if you'd like to actually argue my points, or provide counter points, I'd love to discuss.  But I don't care what your "majority of feedback" says. 
Also, using a short time frame (past 24 hours volume by exchange) could cause large fluctuations in your VWAP, could it not?
Edit:  Please don't downvote OP's comment.  He didn't say anything that is even remotely downvotable.  I was merely trying to spark a discussion.

I'm thinking of critical mass more like a tipping point of no return.  If BTC reaches that critical mass, it will succeed as a global currency.  I'm just throwing out a number, but I think a market cap of $100 Billion USD would be enough of a critical mass. At current levels of BTC in circulation, that would mean the price would need to be around $8,000 USD/BTC.

No, I've chosen to be a part of a computer currency because I know that I can profit from trading BTC.  I honestly doubt that BTC will ever "balance out state power".

This isn't an inflection point.  In fact, I'd posit that this is the return of a more normal phase for the value of BTC.  Volume and trading has formed more concise trading ranges, and volatility is lower than the late March - early April bubble period.

He was just making pie-in-the-sky claims that aren't real.  When you invest using options, you can effectively make a bet on a greater amount of the underlying commodity due to the inherent leverage.  For example, if you wanted to buy 100 BTC, that would cost you something like $13,000 right now.  However, with options, you're making a bet on the future value of the underlying commodity, and you get to do so by only putting up a fraction of the amount you would need to purchase the actual commodity.  So with the binary option, you would buy 1 contract, which probably would represent 100 BTC, and you would pay a "premium" to the seller which represents the cost of the position. 
But with leverage comes risk.  If your bet doesn't work out, and the option doesn't finish "in the money" (i.e. correct and profitable), then you lose your entire investment (the Premium you paid to the seller).  You investment is a total loss.  But if the position is in the money, then you would make a tidy amount that is typically multiples higher than what you originally paid.
What OP was describing was a Binary option in which you would bet that the price of BTC would be below $100 USD at settlement on May 31st.  Since the price is currently stable, and about 30% higher than the strike price of $100, this option is considered pretty risky.  That's why it's currently priced to have an 8:1 payout.  
I think his hypothesis was that someone would take a large bet on the binary option, then proceed to sell as much of their personal BTC holdings as it took to cause a panic, and move the option below $100 USD by May 31st.  Then their option would become profitable and they would get paid 8:1 on whatever they originally paid, and would be able to use those funds to repurchase BTC at market price, and would likely come out with twice as much money as they started.
That would be blatant market manipulation, and very easily discovered.  Also, to make this work, you would need to be the owner of probably over 10+ Million USD worth of BTC.  People with that much BTC won't risk such a dangerous gamble.

The price of bitcoin does not directly affect the dividend payout, but it would affect the ROI.  If you purchased shares with 1.3 BTC while USD/BTC was about $113, your ROI would be much faster if the USD/BTC rate jumped to $200, and much slower ROI if it fell to under $100.

It's pure speculation.  If you're actually trying to save money, go buy a bond and hold it until maturity.

Jim is always a little further on the "sky is falling" side of things.  I do believe that there is further economic pain to come.  We never actually solved any of the fundamental problems of the economy after 2008.  We simply chose to throw money at it until such time as the economy could get back onto stable footing.  But we're 5 years in now, and the economy/markets are perched on a precarious peak that is built with mountains of government cash.  Unstable footing indeed.  The mere thought of the Fed scaling back quantitative easing is enough to send the markets into shock right now.
However, I do not believe that we will suffer a similar (or worse) collapse than 2008.  The current ruling powers would move quickly to quash any serious threats to economic well being with... more money.
Inflation will be the end game.

Yeah, it's just the cumulative version of the bid/ask spread.
So the price is displayed in the middle, with the bid orders below and the asks above.  So the top right number for me currently is  112.0 (or maybe 111.5 if the price moves).  Mine reads "112.0   17090" followed by "111.5   16057".
What that means is that for the price to advance to 112, the market would have to "absorb" 17,090 BTC via buying.  For the price to rise to 111.50, the market place would have to buy up 16,057 coins.  
The cumulative amounts go in 50 cent increments.  Easier to visualize the market depth this way instead of looking at each individual bid/ask order.

Just some advice since I've day traded BTC both successfully and unsuccessfully for some time now:  Be completely unemotional, and very patient.  I've had the most success with my day trading during volatile periods when I was able to be patient and not watch every little tick change in the market price.  Just decide when you think the price is low and buy in, and then set an order to sell at a reasonable higher price that you'd be content with.  If the price races past your sellout price target, don't panic and buy back in immediately.  Be patient.  Formulate a price that you'd like to buy back in at, and put your limit order in.. and wait.  
Patience has gotten me more profit than any other attribute when dealing with Bitcoin.

Well, Mega Upload was basically a site for pirating copyrighted material.  I don't want to get into the semantics of what Mega Upload was and was not doing illegally or legally.  Bottom line is just that the reason people used the site was for illegal pirating.  
What MtGox is doing/providing is not illegal.  There are no laws against buying crypto-currencies with fiat money.  The basic premise of their site is legal.  What the DOHS stepped in about was the fact that Mt.Gox had a subsidiary acting as a money transmitter even though they had specifically stated they would not be functioning as a money transmitter.  That's all on the CEO of Mt.Gox for that screw up (and the myriad of others).  But unless the DOHS can prove that MtGox is facilitating money laundering or illicit activity, then they have no grounds to shut down Mt.Gox.

No one guaranteed the price would immediately stop at $170 or $150.  No one can do that.
I'd posit that you're thinking about efficient markets in the wrong way.  Think of it like this:  Markets are like a rubber band.  Say you hook a rubber band to a nail and then stretch the rubber band away from the nail.  When you let go of the rubber band it will release it's energy, and go flying past the nail in the other direction, but it will expend its energy  quickly and move back to the center towards the nail.  
With BTC prices going so parabolic lately, it's only reasonable that a blowoff would occur, and that prices will snap dramatically lower before reverting back to a more meaningfull sustainable level.

IG Markets is just a company.  They allow regular retail investors to buy/sell various types of options and spreads on stock indexes, commodities, etc.  A binary Option is a simplified version of an option.  It begins with a question: "Will the price of 1 BTC in USD be lower than $100 on May 31, 2013 @ XXX time?"
If you think the answer is yes, you would buy the option.  If you think the answer is no, you sell the option.  I can't find any data on the open interest (amount of open option contracts outstanding currently, and at what strike prices) for this.  I'm thinking OP is just shilling for IG Markets because his post is vague and speculative, and he seems to have disappeared shortly after posting.
Edit:  What I hoped to find was the open interest tables to see if there was a large amount of bets outstanding that the price would be below $100.  From there you can take the amount of open interest and calculate how much money those positions would stand to profit, then compare that against how much BTC (in USD) would need to be forcibly sold through the market to cause a drop of that magnitude.  If the amount stood to be gained from the binary options is greater than the total BTC amount needing to be forced into the market to cause the price drop, then it is at least plausible.  My hunch is that there is no open interest, and he's just looking at a pricing table that shows that binary option paying off at 8:1 if it is in the money, with no data to back up his wild claim.

Part 1 - Mining Power:  Yes, it's feasible that mining power will grow exponentially.  This is why there is a function to adjust the difficulty of mining a block.  As more and more mining power comes online, the difficulty is raised to keep BTC generation on track.  At the moment, we are a few percentage points ahead of schedule in BTC mining because the difficulty level isn't keeping up with the rapid ramp in mining power over the past month or two.
Part 2 - prices:  Nope.  Prices aren't tied to anything you described in your post.

I'm only commenting because you mentioned auditing your credit reports.  This is pretty easy to do, actually!  You can get your credit report for free from each of the 3 main credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian) once each year.  It's sound advice to take an hour or two once a year to go through them and contact each bureau with any changes/corrections that should be made.  They are surprisingly good with phone calls, so that makes the process pretty easy.
Instead of reviewing all 3 credit reports all at once, I like to review one every 3-4 months throughout the year.  For me, the data is almost always identical in each credit report, so it's a good way for me to keep track of my credit report throughout the year without having to pay for a stupid credit monitoring service.
Just a friendly FYI.

I've seen the links.  I follow bitcoin very diligently and actively.  I was one of the first people to test out the Gox lag issue when a user reported it.  That was a clear flaw in MtGox's trading engine/API, and they've since fixed it with the rollout of their newest trading engine.
However, "matching" those micro transactions with large sell offs proves nothing.  It only suggests that high lag times caused market panic.  Correlation does not mean causation.  
I will continue harking about how people can't present any facts or evidence proving manipulation because that's what skeptical people do.  I didn't say that the BTC economy had never been manipulated, only that most of the times when people scream manipulation they are just speculating because they are unhappy with the outcome.  It's what people do.

Yes, but the other exchanges typically follow suit.  The reason the spread is $19 is because this ramp happened very very quickly at Gox.  It's only been like 30 minutes.  Give the other exchanges time to digest the jump, and they will shrink the spread back down to $10.
I always capitalize on these moments.  I was able to rush over to campbx and coinbase and get both my accounts fully invested before the price even started rising.  It's already up $5 since I traded like half an hour ago.
@_date: 2013-05-16 15:07:24
This is not true.  It is actually quite simple to execute an arbitrage trade between CampBX and other exchanges.  All you need to do is get your cash to CampBX and buy at the lower levels.  It's incredibly simple to transfer the BTC after that.  
The problems arise when you want to replicate the process.  You can sell the BTC at a higher price on another exchange, such as Mt.Gox, but getting that cash out of the second exchange and back to your CampBX account is where you'll run into issues.
Basically, it would not be incredibly difficult to run a sophisticated arbitrage trading strategy.  You would want to split up your total funds into multiple buckets and run a cycle over and over again where you first move from Fiat to BTC at CampBX, then move your BTC to a secondary exchange with a higher pricing point, sell your BTC to move back into Fiat.  After that, you'd have to ACH/wire transfer back to your bank account which would either take a few days (ACH) or cost a small wire fee.  Total time to complete one cycle would probably be about 7-10 days.  You could split up your funds into 7-10 different buckets and run a continual process over time.  So long as the arbitrage spread was around 5%, you could make a decent profit.

No, I dont think that has much to do with this.  That news has been speculated upon for months, and the stock markets digest it immediately once it actually becomes confirmed.  None of that is new in investors mindsets.
Everyone around here thinks that Bitcoin is tied to the market and USD as a whole.  I honestly don't see much that shows they move in any sort of parallel or tandem.  It would be interesting to see some correlation analysis done (not that it would mean causation, but correlation is a good start).
My opinion is that this is a technical movement as the long term trendline since the April lows is meeting the consolidation levels we've been seeing over the past couple weeks.  It was a rising wedge formation, and the price is breaking right when the technicals say it should.
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:05:47
This.  Moving BTC is very simple, but moving fiat typically takes days, and usually isn't free.  I've traded an arbitrage cycle before, and it does work, but it's really not as profitable as you would think.  You need to be working with the MAX $ amounts that you can withdraw from an exchange on a daily basis to see any kind of significant return.
@_date: 2013-08-30 14:47:03
Anytime you lose BTC it is very frustrating, but honestly, you made an egregious mistake by sending the coins back to your campbx "from" address.  You should have been more careful in that transfer, and I think it's good policy to always generate a new deposit address for every transfer.  Doing that would have prevented this issue from occurring for you.

Fair market price?  That would mean there's a willing seller AND a willing buyer.  Obviously OP isn't willing to buy at 135/BTC, so it's not a true fair market price.

@_date: 2013-05-29 15:00:10
Your assertions are a valid opinion.  It's hard not to see the basic trend.  
Here's my take:  Since the beginning of this year, Bitcoin has seen a rapid growth in its userbase, and the subsequent rise in the price of 1 BTC from the $20 range to the $40 range made some waves in the community.  This brought in more people looking to cash in on the advance in price, and the rally began to fuel itself.  
People were treating BTC like a stock.  However, BTC is nothing like a stock.  It's far more like a raw commodity, in as much that it reacts to supply and demand economics, has a fixed quantity or production rate that is well known and not easily manipulated, and is valuable as a means of exchange or trade.  Unlike a stock, BTC has very little fundamental (read: financial) data which can be analyzed to ascertain what one would consider a true value of 1 BTC.  Without those fundamentals to look at (I.E. historical financials, growth rates, margins, EPS, YoY Comps, etc), it becomes very difficult to hypothesize a true value.  So we are left to derive a value from the economics of supply and demand.
In that situation, it's not unexpected to see a price fluctuate around a perceived Mean.  When the price is high, people are more willing to sell, forcing the price downwards towards a sustainable supply and demand equilibrium.  And vice versa for a low price.  
TL:DR - I think the trend in the price of BTC is pretty much exactly what you would expect of a supply/demand driven commodity that is trying to find a new equilibrium.  You think this chart is interesting? Go learn about Elliott Wave Theory and apply it to the same charts...
@_date: 2013-07-02 18:02:31
You're thinking about the filing incorrectly.  It states they they will initially offer 1,000,000 shares, and each share will represent 0.2 Bitcoins, which means they plan to have an initial backing of 200,000 BTC.  And the $20 price was just an estimate based on when they originally did the math.  It would be cheaper per share now because the price of 1 BTC has fallen by about 15% since they did their math.
For me, this filing has no data that would portend what price the Winklevoss "Value" BTC at.  It's an ETF fund that is meant to replicate the price of Bitcoin to ease trading.

Ah, true, forgot to think about that from your point of view.   I was still thinking from the gambler's point of view.  So in reality, the house edge is really just the spread between the multiplier and the interest rate of a given "bomb".  
Do you publish any detailed stats on the various bombs?  Things like average times a bomb changes hands before expiring?  Your design is interesting, but I feel like it must be struggling with the fact that it's inherently a "social" gambling site versus a site like satoshi dice being individually based.  
All in all, I like the concept and I think it could take off, but I worry we're just too early on in the BTC adoption process for a social oriented game to be able to take hold.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:31:15
No, an average should not be used.  You can't buy at an average price, and you can't sell at an average price (yet...), so an average price has no real bearing on anything.  The spread between exchanges (primarily Gox vs the rest) exists for a reason.  It shouldn't be glossed over by using an average price.
The only purpose an average price would serve is for people who don't trade on Gox anymore and are bothered by the fact that most sites still reference MtGox pricing as the main pricing (and for good reason, they still have the most volume, even if only by a slim margin).
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:07:23
Well, no one will be able to tell you the answer to that, but here's my 2 satoshis.  The price had formed a consolidating, rising wedge shape over the weekend.  Early this morning the price was hovering around 127-128, which had been a price ceiling for several days.  There was a fair amount of sell side pressure around $128-129 via limit orders that were just waiting to be filled.  A large buy order then took out most of the built up resistance below $130.  Above $130 there weren't a lot of established resistance levels, so with resistance gone, the price ramped higher today.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:13:47
I'm completely unfamiliar with how the ASICMINER share prices actually fluctuate with the value of BTC, so I don't think I can address that issue.  However, I would point out that if the value of BTC rose from $100 USD to $1000 USD, then your dividends from the shares just became 10 times more valuable then when you purchased the shares at $100.  I'm thinking about the shares like a dividend stock.  If the dividends suddenly become way more valuable, then so would the share price.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:58:34
What day did the purchase actually occur on?  Typically coinbase takes 3-4 days for the BTC to settle into your account.  If the actual purchase occurred on June 1st or 2nd, then you're probably not accounting for the fact that the price of BTC dropped about $10 on the 2nd.

Well, you're SOL.  MtGox doesn't really have a viable option to withdraw USD at the moment.  That's why their price is so much higher than all the other exchanges.  Yes, they are processing USD withdrawals, but they will take 2+ weeks at a minimum.  And you will pay the international wire fees.
Your best bet is to leave MtGox altogether and go to an exchange that has better inflow and outflow processing.  I recommend Coinbase (links directly to your bank account) or CampBX (still accepts Dwolla deposits).  The downside to this is that the USD value of BTC is about $10 lower at any exchange outside of MtGox (because people can actually get their money from those exchanges, unlike MtGox).

What he's doing is called technical analysis.  The flat line at 150 is trying to show that for a 3 day period the price tried to move above 150 and then consolidated at that level.  At that point we would consider 150 a "ceiling".  Shortly after the price broke higher rapidly, so 150 becomes a "Floor".  The other sloped red line is more of a longer term (ha, it's still only 9 days) trend line.  It shows how the prices bottomed at predictable points from April 1 - 7.  If you extrapolate that line forward through today, he's basically saying the outcome of this crash will be BTC in the $150-$170 range.
Edit:  I should say that I'm not knocking technical analysis, or OP's opinion.  Since bitcoin has no measurable fundamentals, technical analysis is one of the only options left to try and derive "value" with.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:49:08

Ah, I see now.  I was so confused at first.  Well, there won't be a shift away from oil trading in USD anytime soon.  Until a major economic shift occurs, the Dollar will still be viewed as the global reserve currency, and therefore be the dominant trading currency.  If it were to be replaced, it wouldn't be by bitcoin, but instead by a basket of global currencies agreed upon by the major world economies.  However, I would add that Iran hates the fact that USD is the currency oil is traded in, and created an exchange that would allow people to buy oil in other currencies such as the Euro or gold.

That's NOT market manipulation!!!!!!!  I can't put enough emphasis or exclamation points on this.  Just because someone sells a large quantity of BTC doesn't mean they are manipulating the market.  What it more than likely means is that a large trading desk doesn't want to leave their position on over the weekend because no one will be working to monitor the position, and BTC is so damn volatile because it's still very thinly traded.
When someone sells a large quantity (+20k like we saw today), it destroys most of the bids in the system and crashes the price.  That's not market manipulation.  I do not believe the lag that comes after is a product of DDOS either.  It's a result of people flocking to buy at those low levels, and people panic selling to get out in case of a larger crash.
I'm getting sick of people screaming "Manipulation!" every time something like this happens.  You must realize that there are very sophisticated trading desks with millions of dollars actively trading BTC, right?  They move markets when they make trades.  It's why we suddenly see massive movements upwards in price, and also why we see massive moves downward.  Their positions are larger than probably every member of this subreddit.
Source:  I work in finance, have worked on commodity trading desks (this wouldn't go to currency desks because it's not viewed like a currency to trading desks), and still know traders at various banks that actively trade million dollar BTC portfolios.  It's chump change to them, and a very easy market for them to profit from.

The lockup period shouldn't affect the investment decision, unless you think you could get a better return in a separate investment.  Since your strike of 3.5 represents a pretty significant decline in the underlying price of the stock, that makes it far more attractive over a shorter duration like 1 month. 
Like I said, I'm not familiar enough with the goings on of ASICMiner to sell you the puts, but from a seller's viewpoint, it's an attractive chance to scoop up a decent premium in exchange for a short dated, far out of the money option.

That greatly depends on what you see as the end outcome of bitcoin.  
If you think Bitcoin will flourish, but never reach the level of fiat currency (practically blashphemy around these parts), then I'd say we're in the "Early Adopters" phase.
If you think Bitcoin will become a global currency that replaces fiat, then we haven't even gotten to the early adopter phase yet.  We would still be in the innovation phase.
Honestly, I think we're still in the innovation phase, and not because I think that Bitcoin is going to take over as the global currency.  It's just logical when you look at what's happening in the BTC world right now.  In the past 6 months alone, we've seen massive innovations in the space, and we're continuing to see leaps and bounds all the time.  
Now the important part:  Just because BTC is still in the innovation phase does not mean that the price is going to skyrocket as it progresses into larger adoption.  Logically, the price will rise as demand rises, but don't be a fool and equate people adopting the currency into dramatic price gains.

No one can answer that question.  But at the moment, it doesn't look like $140 is going anywhere because there's over 2000 BTC on the order book waiting to buy if the price falls to $140.
Edit: for perspective, if someone put in a 2000 BTC sell order at market, it would drop the price only 60 cents or so to $140.  If someone put a buy order in for 2000 BTC at market, it would ramp the price to $144.  There's a lot less pressure holding the price down than there is holding the price up.

As a former commodities trader, I don't think you understand what actually goes into "taking delivery" of COMEX products.  They have to be inspected upon receipt, warehoused, and then inspected again before you can transfer the physical products to another party.  This is why traders typically exit their positions before First Notice period, or choose to retender if they do actually get hit for delivery.
Inspection and warehousing on tons of gold can cost upwards of $10k, and that is if you are able to resell the commodity in a short time frame.

Because BTC are being treated like a commodity or investment by the CFTC, I'd believe that profits would not be realized until you sell the BTC for fiat or another good or service.  Simply mining the coins would not trigger a profit to be realized.  I look at mining as the process of making an investment (i.e. the initial purchase of a commodity for investment, not the divestiture).

Yet you hide behind a throwaway account.  I guess you're just fearful of the authoritarians who will come and lock you up and terrorize you because you disagree with Directive Zero.  Good call, mate.
Edit:  Yes, I will openly mock you and make sarcastic remarks.  I don't care if you think I'm just confirming your suspicions.  You haven't presented a logical argument, only a really longshot conspiracy theory which you wholly believe is absolute moral truth.  You even go as far to say that We (the authoritarians) are oblivious and blindly following some terrible directive.  It's just ludicrous.

10 years?  No.  In 10 years there will still be BTC being mined.  That would be some insane inflation to need 16 decimal places.  We don't even need 8 right now.  Most transactions can be handled in the 3rd decimal place.  
Think about it mathmatically.  For 1 "Nakamoto" to be worth 1 penny, 1 BTC would have to be valued at $100 Quadrillion dollars.  That's 100,000,000,000,000,000.00.   So no, the Nakamoto is impractical and unnecessary. But kudos for the thought/idea.

Bank transfer from gox is reasonable when compared to other options.
Question:  Do you have a dedicated Dwolla account already linked to your bank account?  If so, consider transferring your BTC to CampBX, and then selling there.  The spread between MtGox and CampBX is very small at the moment, and then you would still be able to utilize the dwolla transfer for only their $0.25 fee.

OP is not entirely off point with his assertion.  Because Bitcoin is deflationary by nature, it encourages a person to save their BTC because it should naturally rise in value over time.  This by itself isn't a bad thing, as saving is a positive.  
However, in the extreme case, that hoarding can cause a deflationary spiral where no one wants to spend their BTC because the value is rising so quickly that it becomes financially prudent to wait as long as possible before spending.  Because there would be less and less BTC being spent, they would be in higher and higher demand, and the price would rise exponentially in a rapid manner.  But with actual commerce grinding to a halt due to the hoarding effect, the rise in price would be unsustainable, and would eventually collapse (in a far greater bubble than any that the bitcoin world has seen to date).
But please keep in mind that scenario is an extreme case, and there are no documented cases of this actually occurring in modern finance (to my knowledge).  It is an established economic theory though.

In the market sense, yes, an equilibrium price would be found eventually.  That is pretty much a certainty.  But the problem is not in finding an equilibrium price.  The problem is the spiraling run up in value followed by the inevitable crash.  That instability would never be tolerated for a currency.
Also, while the equilibrium price would be discovered through natural market forces over time, the price would overshoot (i.e. crash) to the downside before rebounding.  An analogy that has always worked for me is that markets are "mean reverting" like a rubber band.  If you wrap a rubber band around a nail (the nail would be the mean) and stretch it away from the nail in one direction, when you let go of the rubber band it will go in the opposite direction back towards the nail.  But it won't just reach the nail and stop.  It will overshoot the nail and stretch in the opposite direction (overshooting) before it bounces back towards the nail again (reverting to the mean).

I, personally, have no issue with you or other people spreading the knowledge of Bitcoin or bitcoin related investments.  I think it's great. 
However (and it's a huge *however*), the manner in which you did so was very poor.  People are incredibly unfamiliar with bitcoin and related investments, and many have very negative connotations associated with the thought of bitcoins.  Your comment came off sounding like someone trumpeting an unknown cheap stock that pays dividends, and "with a little luck" could make you a huge return!  
Proper investments don't get pitched that way.  You would have been better off providing hard facts that show growth, proven financials, or even notable bitcoin stocks that had large growth in value.  
We, as the bitcoin community, need to take great care to position bitcoin in a positive, professional manner, otherwise people like the commenters in the subreddit will never take bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:41:06
I read it all.  Even my TL;DR will be a bit long because there's a lot to summarize, but I'll try.
TL;DR -  Bitcoin protocol is wonderful, but it has some issues that we will have to face if it becomes a globally accepted form of payment and begins to replace fiat currencies.  At the moment, greed is pervasive within the BTC community, and can be seen via: A. The fact that most BTC are being hoarded as investments instead of actively spent, B. The commoditized nature that BTC has taken on, and C. The RAPID growth in ASIC mining computational power to scoop up mined coins.  The fact that BTC can be exchanged for fiat currency should be viewed as a negative for BTC as a whole because it drives this greed, and the community should discourage and possibly even outlaw exchanging BTC for fiat.
Also, he talks about the fact that BTC has the potential to be this game changing world currency that kind of levels the playing field for everyone. However, in reality, only the wealthiest population of the world (hard to quantify, but I'd agree considering countries where BTC has gained traction) has been able to take advantage of the early adoption of BTC.  So effectively, we've screwed over the poor people again, and enriched the wealthy even more (via their early adoption and price appreciation).
He closes by saying that while BTC is great and has wonderful potential, he does not think that it will succeed as the currency of the future.

Foreclosed on?  I'm not sure what that has to do with bitcoin.  The banks can't force you to buy a house that you can't really afford.  If you're getting foreclosed on, it's partly your own fault as well for overextending yourself financially.  Digressing, though, obviously there will be some cases where it's not the homeowners fault, and I'm not trying to defend banks, but you can't only blame the banks for the housing crisis.  Exuberant homebuyers need to take some blame as well.  
I highly doubt the fiat system will magically fix itself.  I'm in the same boat with you when it comes to playing it safe via bitcoin.

You could be right.  I'm not sure how the government would take the growth/decline in the value of the BTC into account in the long run.  I'm inclined to disagree with the methodology you put forth though, because I feel like that would be a form of double taxation.
Actually, as I was typing it I took money out of the equation and pretended that OP was just bartering with his employer, and lets say he received XYZ goods for his services.  That would be his original income for his services which would be taxable.  That we have established.  Lets say XYZ was worth $1000 USD when he received it.  If later on he sells XYZ for $1100, then it would make sense that he'd have to pay either short term or capital gains on the $100 gain in value.  I think that's fucked up.

But 'DidHeJust' is asking about the ROI on buying a share of ASICMINER.  He'd pay for a share in BTC, and retain ownership of that share.  That share has inherent value (which can rise or fall, but will most likely rise).  Therefore, purchasing a share will not remove him from the price appreciation of BTC.  Not only will his 1.3 BTC (current value) share grow in value if BTC value rises, but his dividends will be worth more as well.  I don't see where you're going with your train of thought.

Arbitraging the first time would be easy.  The problem arises when you want to remove your cash in a fiat currency and move it to an exchange with a low price to buy in at.  The withdrawal periods are long and some sites charge wire transaction fees, and there can be limits as well.
I've given all of this consideration, and the only way I can see it being a profitable operation would be if you had a large sum of money to begin with, and you split it up into smaller amounts that would each be less than any ACH withdrawal limits for the exchanges you would be working with.  Then you would just have to keep rotating each group in a cycle.  So say you split 50k up into 5 groups of 10k each.  You would buy 10k worth of BTC at the low price exchange, and then transfer it to the highest price exchange and sell it at a higher price.  Now that you're back in cash, you'd ACH the money to your bank account.  I'd do that whole step in one day.  Then the next day, I'd repeat the process.  After 4-5 days, the 10.2k from your first group would flow back into your bank account, and you would be able to roll that amount right back into the low price exchange to begin the process again.

Yes, obviously I'm familiar with that.  I actively traded MBS and CDO's when I worked in derivatives trading for an investment bank.  
My point was that it's not 100% a banks fault when people default on their mortgage.  The bank didn't cause you to miss your payments.  The bank didn't get you fired from your job, or force you to take on a mortgage that you really couldn't afford.  In the housing crisis, many homeowners are just as culpable as the banks.  Greed isn't just a problem that banks face...  It's a main street problem as well.  But people just blame the banks for it because they'd rather point the finger at an external source instead of also pointing the finger at themselves.

Because it is more like a commodity than a currency.  Modern currencies' values are derived from the underlying GDP, trade balance, economic outlook, and a host of other factors.  With bitcoin, there aren't many underlying fundamentals that can be readily analyzed.

Ok, well the way that user accumulated his wealth in BTC was because he was a very early adopter, purchasing coins when they were valued at pennies per coin.  Some of the first transactions with BTC put the value at less than 1 cent per coin (way back in 2009).  That changed quickly.
My guess is the user you're asking about simply bought into bitcoin very early, probably when coins were still less than 10 cents per BTC.  At that rate, if he had purchased $1,000 USD worth, those coins would now be worth over $1.3 Million, or about a 133,000% return.

I'm confused on what you mean by Amazon providing BTC liquidity, so I'm just going to avoid that part for now.
As for hiding Amazon's transactions, yes, generating a new receiving address for each transaction would be standard protocol.  However, all of those transactions would need to be consolidated somewhere.  Amazon wouldn't want a million different transaction accounts to keep track of.  The problem with concealing for Amazon would be when they have to consolidate those BTC to be exchanged back into USD.  
I doubt amazon would use Bitpay services, not because Bitpay is bad or couldn't handle the volume though.  Amazon would just build their own platform to handle it (or buy Bitpay outright and integrate it).  They tend to do everything their own way.
