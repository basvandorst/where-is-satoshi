Satoshi would choose Bitcoin Unlimited.

Wow. Here's the proper sort for mobile users:

Naked short selling allows manipulation for as long as a closed source market exists.  You essentially fill the public's buy orders with brand new shares, then buy back and destroy those shares once the price is floored.

But that's only true with small blocks.  The obvious answer is larger blocks and no RBF.

So you agree that RBF makes bitcoin transaction not near-instantaneous.

More users and TXs = more fee revenue for miners
No need to increase fees!

**Who funded the development of RBF?**

Each time the reward halves, it creates less selling pressure, increases the price, and thereby keeps the reward in purchasing power high.  The 25 BTC (~$10k) reward now is much more than the 50 BTC reward 4 years ago (~$300).  This system is genius and doesn't need any tweaks, tweakers, etc.

This system goes forward and self regulates, it doesn't stop for a small few with a "what if" scenario and a solution that will make them rich.

Satoshi would obviously dump segwit and buy BCH.  BCH was created in his vision.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:37
That should put the angle of the B at BCH proper level ��
