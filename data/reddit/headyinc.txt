Well i can just write down my passphrase on a piece of paper and hand it to you right? And now lets say you send your gold to me (crossboarder i guess), lets compare fees now

airdrops! Most are junk but there are some rare gems around

Are you really comparing inflation with price speculations? Coz i doubt price will fall due reprinting ;). And the greek were able to withdraw like 20 bucks a day. Do you think your wallet will restrict your spendings when shit goes down?

Worst case the end is near scenario you mean? In that case gold would be worthless too. Food, tobacco, medicins and guns would be the favoured currencys... not gold. ;)

Ask the greek how safe their money was by the time banks did shut down over night. Or head over to venezuela. Thinking that cant happen to your country? Good luck

Never ever use skrill for any kind of money movement. Those guys just freeze accounts and take the money and rebrand if the fud is to big. Happened to me

Never leave any money on Skrill. If you end up having any kind of trouble with them they will just shut down your account and ignore your emails. Happened to me as i recieved a payment from an "hacked" account.
