and I invest in them too. Some things are just more stable than others. I mean I hope those companies die and get replaced by healthier alternatives, all I need is a good tank signal to get me to pull out of them and move it elsewhere where my money already is.

Everyone I know who looks at their account everyday alway panic sells and ends up having to buy back in for less coins. The best investors I've seen forget its there and come back to it in a couple years to find they have hundreds of thousands to millions.

Because bitcoin isn't backed only by the us dollar market, bitcoin is backed by all the currencies of the world including gold and silver. You can put almost any major currency into bitcoin and that is what is happening today. So many people keep calculating only off of the us market forgetting all the other notes being put behind it, so if you want to get an accuret picture of it's value you'd need to add the total markets off all the currencies being put behind bitcoin, take 30 percent of all the worlds markets and then put that behind bitcoin and see where the value will be. 30 percent global market share is what we should see by the time where in our 40's in the 2040's.

This is what I wanted to hear. This is what my experience in the game tells me too. Not jumping into them at first instead of bitcoin was a huge mistake on my part. Saw etherium at 8 dollars and jumped on btc at 700 dollars for 120 dollars instead -_-. Same mistake with litecoin not updating my app and seeing it till it was 30 dollars. Still grabbed like 17 of them but If I would have seen it at 3 dollars 2 months prior I would have picked up 1000 coins. I'm waiting for the major wallets to add another under 10 dollar coin to grab a thousand of them and sit tight.

It's 2k I'm willing to lose. Plus if I sell now I gaurantee myself the loss of 1k vs waiting for a possible bounce back and making it all back.

You sure? it's been the only one to make a bounce back up since the dip last week.

You were saying at it's most .001 would equal 100 bucks. A number that is already feasibly close and no where near the potential cap.

There not all in the tech sector, what part of "just listed examples not my full portfolio's diversity list." didn't you understand? I've got that dirty money in tabaco, oil, pharma ect too, I just don't list the money I'm ashamed to be invested in. I'd rather not support those fuck corporations but must diversify to be safe. Either way I'm not mentioning them in my lists and giving them free exposure. Wouldn't want to encourage others to support such vile businesses, rather showcase the honest companies I put my money behind.

What do you think I meant by "putting my money in every direction to sunday" or "I thank the cash cow for allowing me to diversify my bonds" I've invested more than what I listed, just listed examples not my full portfolio's diversity list. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:38:45
Thats okay, that's why I only put in what I'm willing to lose. But if I'm honest, I'm willing to bet my left nut that we are going to be shocked in 20 years when bitcoin hits a number no one imagined, a number so ridiculous that people with .001 bitcoin will be able to live out a comfortable retirement. Hell knows social security won't work for us if our parents are any lesson, so I'm putting my money in every direction to sunday till something works out; tesla, amazon, bitcoin, bitcoin stock, alt coins, nasdaq. If I'm in everything then even if half fail I'm still growing. Even better we are in an economic dip rn, if predictions from the guy who inspired the movie "The big short" are right then the next 2 years we should see a bigger dip than we saw in 2008. If he's right then I'll be able to pick up the best stocks for pennies on the dollar and just wait for it to rise back up like my investing professor taught us. Guy made 6 million from 16k in 2008, so my 100k should grow nicely once the stock market crashes good enough to unload it into. A 100k only made possible from crypto, so I'm not doubting the cash cow by any means, I thank the cash cow for allowing me to diversify my bonds while still keeping a respectable majority in the cash cow (It's still the fastest growing investment in history after all).

It's times like these when I feel like I should forget about checking my account for about 2 years and then come back to see my money ten fold. It's very hard on the heart seeing I made 3k over the weekend and then lost 1k overnight, but hey still way up from what I started at. Either way, [this is my screensaver to remind myself what to do in times like these.](
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:28:35
.001 at 100 would happen at 100k, something easily feasible in 2 years with bitcoins growth record. That is a very small cap for bitcoin to peak in 2 years and stay stagnant. ~~Every top person~~ Even the best analyst spectates at least a million a bitcoin by the 2020's so if it doesn't stagnate after 1 millions then 20 years after that the price for one coin would be astronomical if it's pattern continues.

Dude it was insane! I sat waiting all day long and out of no where boom! like 20 orders for 9k bitcoin. Too bad my submission I've had ready for hours screwed up and I had to reloaded, missed first post by nano seconds :'(

It's only temporary, just put a bid order for 9k and I'll put  sell order at 9k and well get it back up

You can negotiate it with a good credit union that is partnered with a crypto service. You can even change what coin your check is converted to when it comes in each month by percentage distribution, that way you can move your money into more profitable crypto currency if you see one.

Yeah, I bought a house and a car with my BTC, even my food and clothes are still bought through it. Please explain to me again how I can buy virtually nothing with my crypto? Haven't even touched a dollar in 2 years now thanks to it. Hell and now with the crypto debit cards I really can buy anything with my hodlings.
Edit: Not refering to u/Terminal-Psychosis, but agreeing with him while arguing to someone higher up the thread that said you can't buy anything with crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:30:52
I agree that 1 bitcoin is worth 10 million dollars, anyone else agree with me? Or do I have to wait till 2033 for everyone to realize that value?
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:19:26
Even before bitcoin got big enough for my to use with my hodlings I didn't really touch money, it's dirty yo. Also, millennials like myself like to do everything through a card.

Sorry, He beat me by literally seconds, if my page wouldn't have screwed up causing me to resubmit I would have been him. Ahhh! Well looks like this was the last chance to get this 9k post. I tried I failed, I learned. Can't succeed without failures to learn from. Next time I see an opportunity Ima constantly reload the page and set up the submission so I don't get beat to the post like I did here.

Don't need gas when you have an EV, and the Solar Panels on the roof take care of that juice. I also use crypto debit cards to purchase things that don't currently sell for crypto directly. It makes it so I never have to convert, although the card converts for you when you purchase. Either way thanks to services like theirs there's no need for me to access cash anymore unless the crypto idea dies. But at this point I don't see it going there anytime soon or anytime for that matter.
Google crypto debit card if you don't believe me. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:33:43
Like I said in the previous comment: *"Sure you'll lose some of the money your check got converted too for a while, but the money you put in months before will be so far ahead it won't matter that your last 5 thousand dollar converted check is only worth 2 thousand dollars atm(at the moment), because the 100k of your pay you autoconverted in through out the last year is now worth 5 million."*
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:15:14
Like I said, crypto debit card. Converts directly for you when making a purchase without you ever having to see cash or even initiate a conversion. Anything takes cards now a days, and if they don't; I say sorry for your loss of my business, you should've evolved to crypto.
And as for getting paid in crypto, not exactly. I have a service that converts my paychecks to crypto as soon as they come in, never even have to convert the money to crypto myself. It's all automated now, anyone could do it if they would realize it's the best financial move to do. Sure you'll lose some of the money your check got converted too for a while, but the money you put in months before will be so far ahead it won't matter that your last 5 thousand dollar converted check is only worth 2 thousand dollars atm, because the 100k of your pay you autoconverted in through out the last year is now work 5 million.

@_date: 2018-04-25 00:25:40
But then my money stays stagnate without growth. By auto converting it my money is growing while allowing me to spend fractions of the hodlings without spending more than I autoconvert/rate of investments growth.
