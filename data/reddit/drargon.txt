How do you actually get the sats from one of these tip bots? Does it make you a temp wallet or something?

FUCK PayPal! I sold a set of nice speakers to a dude off of Craigslist for almost $500. Made sure the money was through PayPal and deposited in my bank account before he left with the speakers. A month later the bastard initiates a chargeback and PayPal immediately sides with the buyer, despite my persistent communication and a police report. Any service that facilitates this type of blatant chargeback scam should be put out of business. I’ve learned my lesson: cash or crypto only.

Cool idea. I hadn’t heard of the app.

Probably a less than popular opinion in these parts, but I would fill up your yearly contribution limit to the Roth first and just slam it all into VTSAX or VTI. Once you’ve done your responsible investing, then have speculative bitcoin fun. This is what I do.
Investing should be boring. Speculating should be fun.

Lol. Amazing. This may be the first time this sub has genuinely made me laugh.

Probably not a popular opinion around here, but I would diversify a good chunk into the traditional equities market. Sell all the forks and like 50% of the btc (save cash for taxes) and then buy up some VTI or ITOT index funds. Save the rest on a ledger for future gains. You’ve already hit the jackpot, now is the time to put some in a more conservative investment and let the compound interest make you rich.

This is probably the right answer. 
I would go further and add that the “portfolio” discussed here should exclude 3-6 months of living expenses as an emergency fund kept liquid in a high yield savings account.
Emergency account first, then investment portfolio.
