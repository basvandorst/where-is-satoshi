Just watching some videos on it now. Specifically:  
Id appreciate some input into the way this is trending as I got shook off like an amateur. I bought into the fundamentals and made purchases at 640aud down to about 500aud (even as it dropped). I intended to hold, but i was a little over-invested so I had to sell down my holdings to a level i was comfortable losing. I started selling incrementally as it moved under 400. I got played beautifully, but i wouldn't mind getting in on the next run.

Do you think an EFT would give Bitcoin immense credibility?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:46:49


Maybe im incorrect as its 3:42am here and im seeing double, but the initial thread was: "So, the argument that bitcoin volatility will drop as the bitcoin economy grows seems to be false. Am I missing something?" Respondents seemed to defending Bitcoin by saying: "Yes it's volatile but overall it's gone down significantly. 2 years ago the average volatility was 10%. This year it's been 5% or under. That's a significant improvement." My point is that any normal stock that isnt highly dubious (like enron, bitcoin, ponzi schemes etc) has less volatility the more it grows, and yada yada yada i need to get to sleep

Banks retail national currencies. Central banks wholesale them those currencies. While banks will be all too eager to deal in bitcoins and other products, the central banks that provide them with their most profitable product (national currencies) will not. Also, their is a incestuous relationship between banks and the central bank (i.e. certain banks are shareholders in a central bank) but ultimately the ideology of the central bank will dominate as it goes far far beyond that of profit seeking for commercial banks. For example, The united states uses a central bank warfare model i.e. forces countries to take usd with military threats.

I think you missed the point..

Hi, thanks for the info. Ive been looking for a new exchange ever since coinjar started to charge gst. I actually loaded up on btc just before the tax was charged (to avoid it) and that was just prior to the crash. Not happy. I didnt know coinjar wasnt legally obliged to charge gst and yet they are. Thats so stupid!
@_date: 2014-10-09 02:45:52
Im having that same problem. Ive contacted them numerous times and bascially said "well how can i buy from you" and they said I cant at the moment. I even looked at getting a Entropay card and pay their 7% odd fees as that still would be cheaper. Do you know if that would work?
Its such a shame about coinjar and the gst. I would happily use them but im not paying an additional 10% on top of otherwise inflated prices
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:19:32
Can you explain to me why now is the best time to get in? Im no expert, but I imagine this will plummet again. The price is clearly being manipulated
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:18:06


Thats good. Buy then. I bought $3000 worth at $640 just before this crash. Unbelievable bad luck. I was ok losing 1000 so I have gradually sold my position down, but ill buy on the way back up, which i think wont be for a week or two as this is going under 200 for sure.
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:04:49
I wont argue with you my friend. If you are going to get your news from mainstream sources, I suggest you spend a few months watching RT and the BBC and then validate the information they provide with your own in depth research. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:09:54
Come on now. When you're a 10 billion market cap you cant expect the same % volatility as a 50 million micro cap

I was about to learn how to tip to tip this person but apparently i cant, so i will send him positive energy with my mind. But yeah, i couldnt agree more: this whole decentralized power/currency movement is starting to show a really nasty contradictory side to it. Such vehement being excreted by those wanting to use this movement to seize more power in their lives. So hypocritical.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:46:33
I dont know what that means? You predict this is a fundamental change and not just  "bitcoin being bitcoin" 
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:09:52
I dont know where to start. There are heaps, and have apparently attracted the best and most creative minds in tech. Just google "bitcoin start ups" i guess. I did like the sound of Andreas talking about altering bitcoin transactions in such a way that the maths was more palatable to the user. For example, instead of buying some socks for 0.003428 btc, they will break it all down into an easier to use number, like 10 bits for a pair of socks. Dont ask me how...
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:19:42
What position are you holding?
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:39:11
Im still very bullish on bitcoin - VERY bullish in fact. I think the price should be considerably higher and would hold if i could, but i unfortunately had to sell down my holdings as i was a little too overexposed and the price drop was bugging me more than it should. It will certainly bounce back up, but I could see it decline for the next 3 months or more before that happens.
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:27:49
I think this is a really important issue, do you agree? If it gets shot down, it could be indicative of a slow move to suffocate Bitcoin and it will be reflected in the price. If the SEC embraces it - and the SEC is arguably the most corrupt institution in the US - then it will do wonders for Bitcoins price/adoption.

Do prepaid cards like entropay work? What other options are there? Im also having trouble buying from circle with my NAB card.
Just found this. Would it work:
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:09:35
Me too. I bought at 1 dollar and sold smack bang on the November '13 high. I sold everything. I will now buy again at the lowest point in this crash. I am seriously.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:28:09
Volatility should decrease with the market cap, thats common sense, because its harder to swing the price, the larger it is. Of course this rule doesnt apply to things like enron, bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:32:41
Im open to receiving my news from anywhere, so you tell me which mainstream news source is better and ill check it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:16:51
Im not sure I phrased it right. Ill use an example: we all use/buy $ to conduct trade/pay taxes etc. Lets say there are only 100 $ available for us to conduct trade. The central banks take 2.5% and the banks take 4.5% (central bank bonds + commercial bank real estate mortgage for example). That means we only have 93 $ left for us to trade with making them more scarce and more expensive if there were 100. If the banks took 0% (like bitcoin) it would be less scarce and therefore cheaper. Is that correct? Obviousy the % varies, but the point is banks take a huge chuck of our currency to produce it when bitcoin takes very little.

But if he said: Its just as good if not better than btc and it therefore should be the same price as btc, he wouldn't be lying would he. If he then paid to have more businesses accept it and said it was more widely accepted he wouldnt be lying. He could get all the establishment people on board and they could pump it up to over btc prices and protect it, all the while trashing btc with negative media like silkroad; terrorist associations; hackers; mysterious owners etc
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:20:04
I think it will come down to who has the better product - like you said with the fastest transfer and verification, and whose foundation network can convince the public to accept their coins. They basically all do the same thing is what I am saying and BTC lead is essentially based on marketing and Im not sure if that marketing is worth 8 billion (or so) more than the others.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:24:00


im not really sure what that comment means. please explain?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:41:38
I was also thinking that if Bitcoin became a major international currency it could perhaps create an even further disparity of wealth than whats seen in the current system. Between the small group of people who can now mine the remaining 10 million or so coins, the small group who accumulated most of them during the first mining stage, and the super wealthy elite who can buy up most of them before they hit 5-10k, its not going to leave much breathing room for the status quo. It could be like diamonds - they are hoarded and the price fixed, and then the market shaped and manipulated for the major holders benefit. Having only 1-2 coins could be a disaster for the status quo. Thats why we need to have 20-30 easily exchangeable coins all jostling for position and more constantly being developed and improved upon
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:17:22
But why 0.01BTC when you could buy 1LTC? Why buy 1LTC when you could buy 5NMC? Why do you think people will stick to BTC? Is its barnd that much better than the others? Is its product better? Does it have patents to protect its lead?

Lets say mr rich sees a new cc that, like btc, has only 21 million coins. He wants to be like the winklevii and own a large portion of a new currency and since this currency is currently only worth $.01 a coin (as opposed to $800 a btc) he decides to buy up 1% of these new coins and spend the rest of his money advertising it and building better infrastructure. The coin is called XC and he gets himself all over tv and the paper saying its better than btc and does the exact same thing but better, and that its the investment opportunity of a lifetime as it should have the same value as btc. Its grossly undervalued as him and his paid mouth pieces would say. He puts XC on sporting teams, gets the sociopathic celebs to endorse it etc. and the price starts to align itself with BTC because of his rhetoric and enormous marketing clout. Now tell me why is this not possible? He could easily achieve that with 100 million
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:25:58
No but your wrong. Coca cola and Microsoft have patents, trademarks and various contracts that protect them; Bitcoin has none of that. Furthermore, Coca cola and Microsoft have spent decades forging their market share; bitcoin stumbled upon theirs in a market that is brand new, unpredictable and incredibly volatile

I think expressing most libertarian ideals to people generally falls on deaf ears. I find people just looove serfdom; they love getting manipulated and screwed over. Your friends and family should buy cyrptocurrencies not for the price; not to make a quick buck; not to high five you; but to get off their butts and risk their money on something good and help the world become a fairer and more equitable place. Price shouldnt be an issue. This is bigger than that

What about mining? Got some basic tips to mine alt coins? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:30:33
See thats where im starting do disagree. I think it is quite possible btc reigns supreme, but fundamentally, there is no reason why it should and i think eventually that fact will come out. I think either there will about 4-6 cc's (including btc) that all have roughly the same price, but do slightly different things.

Great questions. Im very interested in competing currencies, or "future institutionally-backed crypto-currencies" as i think they will be a big issue. I started a thread here: 
This was one of my posts giving a hypothetical:
"Lets say mr rich sees a new cc that, like btc, has only 21 million coins. He wants to be like the winklevii and own a large portion of a new currency and since this currency is currently only worth $.01 a coin (as opposed to $800 a btc) he decides to buy up 1% of these new coins and spend the rest of his money advertising it and building better infrastructure.
