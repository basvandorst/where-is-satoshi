Thanks for the info. You may be interested in my recent [post]( here in this thead as well.

Not verified, since I've been waiting for their new instant verification process to be rolled out (which according to their FAQ should be today). The previous waiting time to be verified got so long, I believe at some point they just stopped taking new requests and told people to wait for the instant version.
That said, even if you are correct and two happened to be received on the same date (causing my $1000/day limit to be exceeded), the last deposit was on 10/26 - far longer than being pushed back a day or two.

Will do. They've been good about mail deposits in the past for me, so I'm somewhat perplexed how this one slipped through the cracks.

These are money orders that were cashed on 10/25 (I have the photocopies). It's been almost a month and they claim to have never seen them. The MOs were deposited in a batch at the North Atlanta Bank of America - their bank. If they didn't deposit them, then who did? They don't even seem to care that my money has gone missing, and I'm still "waiting for them to get a response from their bank" weeks later. They are, IMO, dangerously close to moving from incompetent to straight criminal.

A very similar scenario appears to be happening to me right now with CampBX (cashed my money order, never credited me the $). That is, unless someone stole the M.O. and cashed it under CBX's name at the nearby North Atlanta Bank of America that they just happen to use O_o. They stopped replying to my ticket some time ago and I am involving the police at this point.

I posted this as a reply to CampBX in this thread and am repeating it as a reply to the OP due to the high similarity of circumstance:

Their website states:


It's been like that for at least a couple of weeks now, I think - definitely before I mailed my last deposits. Yeah, hopefully you won't have to re-verify (fingers crossed for you). As soon as the new verification system is up and running, I'm definitely on board.

Surprise, surprise - it's 15+ hours after my **direct public reply** to CampBX regarding my $1,000 that has been missing for a month (money orders were cashed on 10/25), and I've yet to receive either a reply here or a ticket update. These guys just don't get it or just don't care about the consequences for fraud (this is way past the point of incompetence).
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:30:53
Just added an update - maybe progress has been made, but still no deposit as of now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:19:33
Not gonna happen, they already told me that when my missing $1,000 gets credited, it will be in USD. When my deposit should have occurred, the going rate for BTC was ~$190(!) as well.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:51:06
I truly wish you you the best of luck. If you don't mind, please update here as each deposit is received. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:28:23
Money orders totaling 1K were cashed by them over ~45 days ago and the deposit still hasn't been credited to my account. They claim to still be looking into it O_o
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:06:49
They were mailed on 10/17, 10/19, and 10/21. MoneyGram shows cashed dates of 10/30, 10/28, and 10/28 (respectively). Deposits occurred on 10/24 and 10/26 (no third deposit). 
I totally agree about ACH too - hopefully that simplifies things.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:26:15
Sounds a bit like my issue ( where you (CampBX) asked me to send a photocopy of my cashed money orders (2 x $500) that you never credited me so that your bank can do "research" to determine what happened to them (even though they were, according to the photocopies, obviously deposited as part of a batch at your bank). Since then (weeks later), I still haven't heard back, even after updating my ticket last week, and am involving the police at this point. There is absolutely no excuse for this behavior and you damn well know it.
users, please see [this thread]( and my comments in [this thread]( for more details regarding my situation with this company.

In your case, I'd give it another day, as accounts are (according to the FAQ) credited 2 business days after they receive/cash it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:13:43
Wow, didn't know the CampBX pic wasn't their real office. I at least assumed they rented an office using something like TechSpace. WTF....
On a similar note, one of my $1,000 money order deposits got cashed and never credited to my account because they claim to have no record of the money order in their bank statements. The money order photocopies show no alteration to the payee field and were both cashed at a nearby branch of their bank. I am still waiting for the "bank to do research and get back to them" - and have been waiting for weeks. BTC was going for ~$190 at the time my deposit should have cleared too ಠ_ಠ I'll know soon enough what happened once the Atlanta PD fraud division finishes its investigation.

Wow, that's a very long time. Took about 3 days to get an initial response this time, then a few more after that to get one working directly on the specifics of my case. I'm currently not verified, so mileage may vary for those verified.
