FAKE POST to get losers excited
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:51:59
yea bro if you do not need money plan to hold for a year or two. I think BTC will hit 10k next year and they crying about 400$
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:00:44
sounds like a scam lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:16:19
i say buy and hold for at least 1 year. you can turn 2.5k into 10k
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:02:36
if he bought today for 2800 hes gonna lose in short term for sure... 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:49:34
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:00:48
exactly, lost 1% compared to yesterday. let weak people sell now so we can buy more and break 3k in june!
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:52:16
preach it man! too many bandwagoners jumped on btc last week i hope this dip shook them off!
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:48:30
a few big players probably sold a ton of coins. good time to buy for people who were hesitant
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:51:20
smooth operator!
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:32:40
well said. todays dip is just shaking off the noobs
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:50:48
just wait for it to bounce back up and relax
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:11:29
bro everyone knows bitcoin is volatile. we here for long term.  it will hit 3k soon anyway
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:59:30
i got multiple accounts. holding bitcoin for 2 years and counting. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:15:13
bro why would you ever listed to anything mainstream media says? they are sponsored by big banks to brainwash middle class and take their money!
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:34:31
If you cant hold thru 400$ dip then sell. you do not deserve the money when bitcoin is worth 10k next year!
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:06:53
HODL - it will hit 3000 next week. let them bandwagon fans shake off
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:25:44
short term it will go up and down. 1 year from now it will be at least double. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:51:09
yea we got nasty gain yesterday. relax and wait for it to bounce back. it is normal. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:54:14
if you are a noob I give you 1 advice: buy BTC to hold for 2-3 years. 1BTC will not change your life now if its gains or loses 400$. It might change your life 3 years from now when its worth 50k...
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:44:46
bitcoin was 2400 yeaterday and its 2400 today relax people it can not be gaining 400 a day for too many days in a row lol
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:48:04
if you want to sell now because it dropped 3000 to 2500 you do not deserve to hold any BTC. Please sell so the right people can HODL!
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:20:02
LOL i would be too lazy to start reddit thread for 14 cents LMAO
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:58:35
haters who did not board the train early gonna hate now :)
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:06:20
let weak users sell so we can buy more and wait :) 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:28:02
how old are you? 6? 
0.02BTC is not worth trashing this reddit with nonsense talk. 
grow a pair and buy more, come back when you got at least 1btc. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:25:36
lots of people sold at all time high. it is perfectly normal. only newbies are scared now. most of them make a big fuss and prolly dont even own 1 btc... fraction freaks lol
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:22:31
fake :)
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:00:32
he is just salty that he did not invest earlier on LMAO I smell a troll. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:00:15
2900 - welcome new friend.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:38:03
its called shut up and HODL!
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:22:51
it was published so big players can buy the dip
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:56:25
If you buy 100 Euros or British Pounds they go up and down in value. Same with Bitcoin just the variations are bigger. It goes up then back down. long term it will keep going up tho. Do not think short term as its pointless. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:07:36
Past month was too much growth. BTC needs to cool off a bit to hit new highs in a few months. We riding this train long distance!
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:10:48
a lot of people who did not buy bitcoins before will hate now. they want it price to go down so their investments can do well elsewhere. BTC is a threat to lots of big fish
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:59:51
first of all US government does not print or own money. Federal reserve is a privately owned bank that loans every dollar to US government on interest. Dollar is worthless as of now people worldwide are slowly realizing it. That is one of the reasons why price keeps going up. If system crashes government will print a shht load of dollars and 100$ will buy you 1 beer if you lucky. Looks at what happened when hyper inflation hit other countries. Bitcoin is inflation proof because there is a finite number of coins in money supply.
