Sadly this doesn't belong here at all anymore, but I think we need these news stories so we don't keep thinking bitxoin is the only coin that can make it big.
We need to keep our eyes on things like this so we can incorporate parts of these ideas to keep btc strong and viable

You have no idea what op wants or why
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:04:09
It's more to the point if moving away from satoshi's vision and away from the ideas in the whitepaper and away from the ideas that made bitxoin 
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:38:20
Sounds like a s am, they probably want you to buy the btc yourself [your friend] then send the coins to them and they'll send you a fake check, tell them you know how to accept btc but not send and ask for them to send you some test btc and scam them bacj?
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:45:09
Well if an increasing exchange rate doesn't show you that the value of tour coins has gone up a huge amount in 4 years nothing will.
It is likely far more valuable as a btc then the cash, if for nothing else that you mined it

I don't know what planet you live on but btc is for certain an apperivation for the word bitcoin, therefore by proxy the network when referring to the word.
A quick look at your history shows that you think you're always right and that everyone else is wrong. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:10:19
Well, why not? Cornell and others ha e shown little harm to miner centralization if we went to 3mb right now. There wouldn't be a problem.
And it needs to happen at some point.
So why not be prepared? Why not do what math says we can? Why? I find no technical reasons not to, only political ones.
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:05:42
That's the point. It's a feature not a bug.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:10:35

Non reversabitly is a feature, not a bug. Perhaps you are too focused on applying rules from another domain into this one. If you want to reverse a tx use a side chain you made to do so
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:53:27
In the most basic sense the transactions would be happening off the blockchain, so a limit on tx# on the blockchain wouldn't matter

Nothi ng was planned to be contentious but when discussion of merits and values was censored people sided with the oppressed dispite the problems. Without the censorship none of this might have ever happened. If we were allowed to discuss the ideas openly then the bad ideas should have lost the debate.

Hard forks are a way to upgrade they aren't something that should be justified by anything other than technical need.

Well this simply isn't true though, a data cap was added and never meant to be so close. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 22:40:08
Is this true? I think not.
The community was always on board with satoshi's vision that when blocks hit the cap the cap would rise. It was the accepted and proposed direction.
Only now that we are here do some come out saying we should keep to satoshi's vision, the one early users adopted.
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:42:57
Technically satoshi release the idea in summer

It sounds like you have some fundamental misunderstanding of the situation.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:03:00
I disagree with a few point in the article, some the even seem disingenuous.
To start people know that to Confirm a payment it must be in blocks. No one thinks bitcoin is truly instant.
Next he says fees must rise, why can't there just be more txs? Isn't that the idea satoshi sold to us?
He is against rapid rise in block size, well 1mb was a limit way above average use, we are talking about the limit here which should be higher than use.
Also he makes it seem like there are all these people that want free txs and I think that is a downright lie.
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:48:55

@_date: 2016-01-19 16:51:59
I don't think that's even a little true, in the white paper and such satoshi said free txs would always be possible because some few nodes might acceptnthem, but that pretty much everyone would have to use a fee if they wanted a timely purchase. It's disingenuous to say people wants free txs for small instant txs, people want what the vision that satoshi gave us. It's in the whitepaper

Maybe you are looking at this the wrong way. Many people who invest in btc only use off chain txs through an exchange and other who do use the blockchain might only do it once ever, and that could have been years ago
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:49:19

You can argue all you want but it comes down to individual miner cost of operation. What does it cost to rent the building and pay for electricity? That amount has to be converted, so the question is about how much profit they are making if any

High enough fees for miners should come from volume of fees,  not size. A least that's what the whitepaper led me to believe.
So to get enough fees to satisfy the miners, I think blocks should be big enough to include enough txs to do so.
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:09:27
It's a stepping stone like the sidechains white paper said. Though I've still not seen any way to do the 2 way peg
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:46:25
Satoshi mined for 6 days before announcing the software was running to anyone,
So that 
seems very unlikely.
Analysis of the hashing done shows the same computer mined the first few blocks as well.
Though I think one block may have been time stamped as found before the client was publicly announced.
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:00:25
But satoshi spelled out there should still be free txs even when btc was mature...

@_date: 2016-05-02 17:28:39
Yes, exactly. Satoshi would have trouble Proving he really is him would require a mix of keys, understanding, being in the right place and time before btc was made, and social confirmation by those that interacted with him.
Holding keys only proves they hold the keya, that alone is not proof.

@_date: 2015-11-10 16:25:17
No, pretty sure you just misinterpreted the question. It sound like that is exactly what they mean from the words describing it. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:24:10
I don't think they mean can't as in permissuon, but that to support a global enterprise not everyone can afford to do so, and by limiting the system so everyone can play they are making it lame

I highly highly recommend not using a desktop wallet as a new user, cell phone wallets are much better. That said electrum for sure, never ever core for new users

This is actually happening in this subreddit, a post on btc this week that was deleted here described how there are bots and paid people to do just what OP describes. 
You can clearly see them in action but they seem to side with the moderators of this sub in their opinions. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:00:22
How about trust less ledger?

That's what op return was for, one man's low fee spam TX is another's low fee personal tx. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:05:10
Why should anyone give them their money, a crowd fund means funders get some return. Do I get hash power? My money back? What
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:39:02
I thought 100 btc mined by sn had been moved? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:10:59
They found a bullet hole and no bullet right? It still strange circumstance 
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:44:44
Belief by Gavin and others that communicated with SN is a key part of positive id. Keys can be stolen, emails hacked. Verification of this cannot be done purely technically as there is no way, p2p keys never used don't help
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:26:28
As has been said time and again this only proves they have the key not that they are somone

See and look online for a ROI calculator to see how hopeless ever breaking even will be for you
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:06:13
Yes, only 100 coins mined by SN are known to have moved so they are the only suceptable ones but SN didn't reuse address so what would be the point?
@_date: 2016-05-08 17:37:35
Please don't call it BitCoin if you want to have credibility. I know I think Satoshi called it that very early, certainly his logo of Bit*coin* and the BC logo. But no one calls it that anymore and it makes one look uninformed.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:12:33
All good until the end, I can't imagine having being anything but tricked here.
Wright having email access would make it easier to pretend to be the real sn
@_date: 2016-05-26 21:19:06
To be fair they have been trying to help for years and received nothing but resistance from the core client devs with commit access. Why should they keep putting up with bratty people who won't be helpful or civil?
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:19:20
Yeah I up voted that post hoping for comments but it was too late. I think I'll just make my own then
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:45:41
Woah whoa woe there little man, take a step back and a deep breath. We don't know anything for sure yes,  it why not investigate leads? Why are you trying to shut down investigation? Do you have something to hide?
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:04:19
I mean some miners are expected to drop out, this lowers the total hash power and lowers the impact of the halving on other miners at least a little bit
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:34:45
We need more info, bitcoin didn't appear as a word in the previous white paper only thr white paper. Was the name satoshi or bitcoin actually used?
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:32:02
So the Casascus method eh? Not legal to sell in the US without a MTL 
Personally I like bip38, that's part of why it was made, and multi sign like denarium is also better than what you are doing but I understand the logistical problems with doing it that way.
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:34:30
I saw a website to introduce people to the c coding of btc, aside from that why don't you set up a local class like that other guy?

Duress account? I've been suggesting it for years now. A dummy account.
Execution can be complicated but I like the 10 digit code that you can enter part of, all 10 for full pemission, 7 for most permission, 4 for access to basic send receive and wrong 4 opens a tied but fake or smaller account.

Wallets on cell phone ate HD wallets they create new addressed based on one secret key.
When you add a seed of randomness at bitaddress you do it once for that while session and everything in it.

It is my understanding that the satoshi is the smallest unit, therefore it can never be gone past, just made smaller
