With Bitcoin Tuesday morning you could buy caviar and champagne and by Tuesday afternoon it may well be spam and white bread.

Every currency *could* fall that fast but as you've said yourself bitcoin is **currently** particularly volatile. I don't feel that it's practical at this point in time to rely on bitcoin for your weekly grocery purchases for example.

The caviar to spam comment is not a literal statement of value it is a hyperbolic joke about the fluctuating value. 
However if you want citations for significant drops you could have a look at the one provided above commenting on the 46% loss in June 11th 2011 by @_date: 2018-05-14 05:51:25
By my standards?

Are you asking for a citation to support the fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies?

You seem busy enough as it is going through my comment history and sarcastically replying to everything I've written.

It took a while (one comment) to "admit" it was a joke because I didn't think anyone would genuinely believe it was a dollars and cents accurate comment. That is why I asked to clarify: I thought there had been a communication error or that English might be your second language. The latter assumption was reinforced by your second comment.
As for "Lmao it didn't even break 20$" since it seems you don't want me to clarify your intentions I'll just go ahead and assume you aren't confident as to how percentages operate and the impact a 46% drop in value could have on a persons **buying power** (the point of this discussion). So hopefully the following is of some use:

Do you now need me to explain how night time works?
