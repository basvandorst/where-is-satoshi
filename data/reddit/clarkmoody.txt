I actually had the print edition of that issue of the Economist.

Thanks for your hard work, Kyle!

It looks like the [hdnode.js]( file contains derivation functions for BIP32 wallets.

Of course, with OpenDime, you can hand someone Bitcoins with no trace on the blockchain ;-)

Let the hate flow through you.
Seriously though, brother. Calm down.
Guilt by association is always a logical fallacy in argumentation. Look at ideas and actions, not associations, and you will go far in life.

Great! How does that actually happen?

This was an interesting UA:

To be fair, Satoshi [wrote](


You're right. The whitepaper does not mention datacenter-sized nodes, but Satoshi does later.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:38:19
Are there any details about how Gemini would use SegWit features? Or are they just running 0.13.2?
"SegWit ready" doesn't really mean anything without discussion of technical details...
Edit: Don't get me wrong. I love Gemini, but I just want to try and improve the level of discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:26:00
Voting with mining costs $$ and ASICs, so not as easily rigged.
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:47:49
The most security comes from controlling your own private keys. A hardware wallet is good for this.
I've found that trading on Gemini has been an excellent experience if you're looking for a new exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:30:15
Not necessarily. It's just that miners have the most to gain from using it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:38:53
Miners are the only ones securing the blockchain by adding work to it. Full nodes validate the blockchain, providing trustless proof of ownership of funds to the node operator.
GPU mining disenfranchised CPU miners. And even then, there were economies of scale to be had for those who made upfront investments in hardware.
There are lots of stakeholders. But the only ones who vote on the protocol are the miners. Mining remains an open market, with smaller operations pointing hash power at whatever pool they choose. Larger operations compete against one another as well.
Plenty of altcoins out there with different rules than bitcoin. Why can't users vote by selling BTC and buying the alts? Where are the more egalitarian coins flourishing? Why do we have to fork the Bitcoin chain?

@_date: 2017-03-10 00:24:39
If I understand correctly, those technologies block transmission technologies allow for faster **propagation** of new blocks by sending only a subset of the block information. This helps miners send their blocks around the network quickly. Validating full nodes already receive the transactions and require all transactions to validate the block. So more on-chain transactions means that everyone's bandwidth &amp; disk usage goes up.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:22:25
I understand validating my own chain, but my node does not contribute to BIP9 fork decisions.
I'll take your second half reply as tongue-in-cheek ;-)
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:36:45
I'm with you, brother. Could be dark days ahead though.

Statists gonna state

Politics is easier than economic or technical discussion and *way* easier than writing code.
Now there are plenty of voices on both subs saying, "No compromise! Screw those guys!" and getting upvoted for it.
The unfortunate thing is that we're all on the same team, and the more we fight with each other, the better it is for the banks and for the state.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:01:33
It secures the network and makes it much more expensive to attack.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:26:04
I've been running a full node since 2011. 
Running a full node does nothing to replace bad miners with good.

Custom personal site built on the XBX WebSocket (unstable at the moment).

You can: 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:21:37
But you have no idea who that particular user is. If you demonize others based on their associations or questions, you're not helping.
Plenty of people on the BU side want bitcoin to scale but perhaps don't have the imagination or are too cynical to understand Layer 2 scaling and various security models.
It's much better to give each individual the benefit of the doubt until they've proved that they are an enemy.
You probably drove that user away forever, rather than building a bridge for understanding.
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:54:20
Probably best. We had quite a back-and-forth going until that point :-/

"How can you oppose the State when you drove on government roads to get here?!"
is right: we're trying to create ever-larger closed loops of production and consumption using Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin is too volatile right now to server the "unit of account" function of money, but that doesn't mean we're not making progress with each Bitcoin transaction.

I understand, but belittling and personal attacks only strengthen their resolve to never compromise. We need everyone involved in the Bitcoin space to be on the same team in the battles ahead.

Indeed. Economic incentives are incredibly important in a digital *money*.
Get the incentives wrong and you doom the system before it begins. Satoshi got it right with the block reward designed to induce people to contribute computational power to the network.

I verified the message, and it checks out. The message [address]( contained a balance of 36k coins at one point in 2013.

Can we put a `FUD` flair on the article?
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:20:25
I can't address your concern, but I will simply point out that JihanCoin will take non-SegWit hashpower out of the legacy/148 competition, effectively increasing 148's power immediately. This assumes JihanCoin power would not have signaled for SegWit.
