Lightning is a terrible idea. I'd probably be discussing that at length.
So is BU for that matter. You don't solve a scalability problem by proposing a solution which will eventually reach a cap and suffer the same problems. That's all BU is - the network has it's limits and miners will always care only about their own wallets than keeping the bitcoin network moving.
SegWit is clearly the way forward. Why waste network hashing power on data that needn't be hashed?
Not to mention BU is run by a bunch of idiots who don't know how to properly internally test something. Hence the whole 0day which downed half the network a few months ago.

Some transaction IDs would add more validity to this claim. Edit: NVM. Assumed Monero worked like other blockchain currencies.

True, true. But in an era of microwaves turning into CIA microphones is that a sacrifice worth making?

Writing down private keys is torture...

It doesn't matter. I'll PM you

Is this an attempt to manipulate Segwit into the 95% release?
Because I've got 3 Pi's (2x 3's and 1x zero) sitting around and &gt;3 unprotected wifis and I'm totally doing this tomorrow.

It just doesn't make sense because those 12 words literally are your wallet. They're the seed for your wallet meaning it can be recalculated from those alone. Are you sure you copied them down correctly in the first place then? Or could you have made a localized mistake e.g. copying color as colour?

If you can find a node to relay it, most mining pools will accept a double spent transaction as long as there's no extra inputs or outputs even if the other one is in their mempool. They don't mind if you remove one though.

He's a lot cuter than I imagined. I was imagining some Japanese cryptography nerd...
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:32:08
It's because using a different 12 words, even if only by 1 character, you've seeded an entirely new wallet.

Why not just use a store receipt printer? You can print QR codes with them and they barely classify as digital.

I don't really see Litecoin as it's own currency as much as a fancy regtest / testnet.  I'm not too keen about lightning network though. It feels like it removes the decentralized nature of Bitcoin on a global scale.

Use coinb.in to create a new transaction using the same input and one of the same outputs, increase the fee (decrease the amount transacted), sign the transaction then find an old node to relay it. I had to do this the other day, had $500 locked in because I was being skint on fees.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:43:48
I agree. The price of a bitcoin transaction is significantly higher than accepting card payments e.g. through Stripe. If we can bring SegWit to 95% adoption, we can push that waaaaay down and handle far more transactions per second.
Sadly AntPool doesn't seem too keen.

Label makers print lasts a REALLY long time actually. They would be perfect. My labels are still thick black from 5 years ago.

We had this same river to cross for our website. We first had 1 solution but later moved to a similar one, but harder.
Here they were:
Option 1: Regtest Node
Have a second instance of the bitcoin core client running, this one in regtest mode.
Create your genesis block, all mined coins will be to 1 address
Use raw transactions to move coins from the genesis address to an address generated for that user (you can use the label feature for debugging purposes, but don't use the accounting features as it's deprecated) - do this using listunspent
Use raw transactions as the funds move around
Withdraw to your genesis address
This worked for us for a while, but it was very hacky, so before we went live we built a system around OpenChain, using Satoshi's as the denominator.
Later we made our own solution which ran around our website database for proving transactions other than cryptography, since we effectively held all the private and public keys anyway. A blockchain was overkill. We just assumed that as long as the node hadn't been compromised, that the transactions it submits are legit. 
Hope this is helpful.
PS: In favor of anonymity, users tend to prefer it if the bitcoin they withdraw can't tie them to e.g. the bitcoin their buyer deposited. We initially had it so a seller's withdrawal would always use their buyer's transaction as input, but decided it would be better for anonymity to scramble it. It was actually easier the final way, we wasted time tracking :)

If I wanted to rig the node count, I'd use my spare server with 16 ips as a docker container and run 16 of them.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:26:03
A minimum of 0%. As long as you're not selling it for real cash and you're not reusing public keys there's no way they can identify you or prove you're lying about it. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:41:39
We just need someone with an eidetic memory and the ability to generate private/public keys and calculate addresses. Ultimate security.
Added plus if their head has a receipt printer attached.

Segwit is the only way forward. That's just the way it is.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:06:19
Seems like you got the recovery phrase wrong. Are you sure you didn't typo? Since these phrases are the seed for your wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:19:02
It's this same line of thinking which had me waiting while for a temporary crash around the 980 mark. Unfortunately my temporary crash never came.

Option 1 was an option using bitcoind. Effectively by giving each user 1 address you can easily track how much funds they have left via the unspent coins function.
OpenChain just helps you keep a ledger, except of local transactions.
Ultimately it's not too hard to make your own.
