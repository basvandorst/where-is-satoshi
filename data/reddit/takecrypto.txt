@_date: 2019-07-23 20:59:09
Are you selling crypto and or drugs for crypto? Why'd they target you.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:47:46

@_date: 2019-03-01 11:11:22
Where ever did you hear that rubbish?
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:09:45
Thought you couldnt do business use over ham
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:33:33
You must admit, that is a fancy certificate.
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:37:01
Damn. Just waiting for the right fish
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:58:12

The internet. Where men are men, women are men, and children are FBI.
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:56:49
Havent heard of the company but that's a common scam
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:13:57
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:58:51
i use cash app because its pretty damn fast AFTER you do the kyc bullshit. The first withdrawal takes forever, but after that its lickity split.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:36:19
Tried to read it, but it requires a membership. No thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:46:03
I feel the opposite. I felt much better, and still do, upon receiving my nano s. I now only use paper wallets for giving gifts.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:09:30
Awesome. Thanks
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:48:35

Wow. The memories that drags up
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:14:25
SCAM ALERT. Cloud mining is always a scam. Why would someone rent you mining equipment for less than that mining equipment would make them directly?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:00:00
Be careful of what exactly? Its not like coinbase is the only game in town.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:08:31
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:52:27
Thats cool and you're cool for making it.

Spam. Check the account, no activity for 6 months and then this shit? Either a sold or stolen account or just plain spam.
@_date: 2019-04-13 21:59:55
That was fun.
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:18:02
You know what? I've heard both arguments. Id like to know the real answer.
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:00:37
I did a transaction earlier today using electrum and paid the minimum and it was still next block. I think that was 1.2sat/b or something like that. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 09:13:56
Buying power changes. Thats why a Pepsi that used to be 79cents now is 1.98
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:14:00
