I've also bought [bcashabc.com]( for the grand total of $20 which will be populated tomorrow.

The only dependencies required on the host are Docker and docker-compose.
The backend uses Rust, yes. We could ship a binary, but it's automatically compiled during the process of building the container anyway.
Postgres vs sqlite - fair enough.
In our use case, it makes more sense to re-use an existing psql database instance.
You are of course welcome to add sqlite support! :P

Yeah, it's mine.  
I don't need Reddit gold. If you want to pay for the cost of buying the domain, an address is in a comment below. :)

That's part of it, yes. (I have almost a year of historical data on my node as I started work on this earlier in the year.)
Ultimately I'd like to have it monitor a lot more and be almost like a web-based version of bitcoin-qt. An alternative front-end, if you will.

I've been developing and running this monitoring software for quite a while, and recently got around to making it ready for distribution.
You can run this yourself - the software is AGPLv3 and scripts are included to start the containers as necessary and run your own Bitcoin node.

Thank you!
No specific relay settings, however, the node is pruned so it only has approximately 10 connections at any time. If there are enough donations I will be able to upgrade the server and run an unpruned node.
1 - in the works; I'd like to change the charting library entirely, chartist.js was just the first I'd tried that had decent performance.
2 - vsize. It uses the mempool REST API in which 'size' actually represents vsize.  is my pull req to add weight (and possibly base size would be useful as well). A commit to add wtxid to mempool stats hit master the other day and that can be used to check segwit tx counts.
3 - exactly that.
jhoenicke's was the inspiration, there's a lot of stuff I'd like to add but no way can I beat his historical data :)

CPFP is accounted for in getblocktemplate.
Notice that the chart often has spikes in it (e.g. you can see a dip, and then a peak afterwards - that's a package of transactions).

Recent updates:
Historical data going back 7 days is available.
C3.js now used instead of chartist.js to display more informative tooltips.
Selecting different metrics to chart is possible.
More information is now shown about blocks (including the percentage of segregated witness transactions).
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:50:03
Update: now uses C3.js rather than Chartist.js to display the chart. You can now highlight individual fee levels by hovering on the legend, and the tooltip is more detailed.
It uses a bit more CPU to do this but I think it's well worth it, especially on desktop.

Hi all,
I've recently updated my node monitoring software to show transaction feerates that my node would include in the next block if it were mining.
You might be able to use this to inform the fee level you set on your transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:47:45
This is incorrect, see my top level post.

The pubkeyhash underlying a Bitcoin address is 160 bits in length.
If RIPEMD160 functions as intended, it would be expected that there are 2**160 possible p2pkh addresses.

I am a very minor contributor, but I can echo this statement.
As with many OSS projects, there's a whole bunch of unpaid development work that is the result of individuals choosing to spend their free time to improve software they use and enjoy.
This is hardly unique to Bitcoin - any project that undergoes a significant change in ethos risks losing goodwill in that way.

Transaction fees also reward miners.
Historically the entire block reward was due to the subsidy.
In the last block, fees made up ~2.5% of the reward for the miner. Some blocks have had a higher percentage than that.

On the github page ( there is an animated GIF. Feel free to make a video and upload it somewhere if you wish :)

Manually seeking to blocks/transactions by hash/height/txid now added. \o/
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:35:01
A related issue was opened just now - can you try with 'pip3'?
(On my machine pip and python are using py3 by default, on many systems they use py2).
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:53:30
1. is now done, re: my other post. :)

Hello all,
Some of you that have been around for a while might remember 'bitcoind-ncurses', a TUI for bitcoind.
It's been a good while and I've recently begun work on a full rewrite of the software to support the latest version of bitcoind and to use Python 3's asyncio support to drastically speed up operation and avoid blocking UI problems.
The current version has a monitor mode which shows the current state of the node, a wallet transaction viewer, block and transaction viewers, a debug console, and a network monitor. It is almost at feature parity with the old version - the main missing bits are seeking blocks and transactions manually by entering hashes/txids.
It runs well both using remote RPC (e.g. ssh tunnel) and on the local machine, in a terminal emulator or within something like tmux.
I would appreciate feedback - in particular, any missing dependencies or issues with running the software that I haven't yet caught.
(old repository at  no longer maintained)
p.s. live mempool stats:

Could you paste a log from a crash? Preferably in a github issue, if you have an account.
I am aware of issues with timeouts - at the moment if an RPC call times out (5 seconds), the exception is unhandled and the program exits. That will be fixed in time (at the moment it expects calls not to fail). In particular it means that if your node is in initial block download it almost certainly won't work.
