My public school was the best in the state, top 50 out of all high schools in the country, and totally free. The private schools that recruited in the area claimed to be "as good as", not "better than" the public school system.

Silk Road. A friend and I were going to get some to purchase a psychedelic analogue, at about $120 when BTC was $5.20ish. We had to use Dwolla because they looked like the only trustworthy company that Mt. Gox used to get currency to tier site. Turns out Dwolla put a hold on the money for 30 days until you could use it... BTC went up to just over $6 and we didn't have enough to buy what we wanted at the end of 30 days, so we just got our money back. Then I finally bought in at $480 when Gox went down a couple weeks ago.

Exactly. You buy a collectible car, it gets auctioned off for millions many years later - why would you not have to report those millions of  dollars?

Actually I think it's Mt. Gox.

Either way, he makes a good point - that's not a very user friendly system.

Most likely. I'm still a noob at this too haha, but from the way I understand it, the ability to mix successfully is dependent on the total amount of bitcoins mixing in relation to the amount you are trying to mix and how many different addresses are used in the middle layer between input and outputs. If over the next ten years, mixing becomes really prevalent (most likely to become more prevalent than now) then I say it will be easier to mix larger denominations.

Ahh yes, we'll be buying bitcoin with bitcoin. So if you don't have bitcoin you can still get some! Wait...

I think you should retain that address for Wikimedia, and create a new address that is only yours.

He supposedly had a stroke too. This is an important fact.

Nah, something like this should be vector - which is why svg, eps, or lastly an ai file would be the best. Preferably with type outlined too, and a spec sheet with typefaces used, Pantone colors, etc.

Just be mindful that there is a ton of malware on the Android OS and bitcoin is a great place for nefarious individuals to implement it.

Just get electrum, and write the seed somewhere if you don't think you can remember it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:20:40
It's still a win for bitcoin in general though too.

It would have to be done over a loooooong period of time with a mixer. If they did it all at once, it would have largely just mixed with itself.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:17:22
But that at least narrows it to a subset of possibilities.

Would be a million times better if your Dropbox sync could be restored on other computers and you could have/generate more than one address on there.

Yeah very serious.

Same, I bought in at $492 when Gox went down. I clicked their website, went back to reddit, saw the post, clicked back to their website and it was down. My next stop was coinbase.come buying little increments as it slowly fell that night. Hell of a day.

How exactly is that possible? Surely Pauli would have a bone to pick with you.
