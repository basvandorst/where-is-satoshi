Thanks. 1M means only a big number for the sake of the example. I learned a bit today, thanks again

1. a device controlling the flow of fuel or power to an engine.
"the engines were at full throttle"
In the case f BTC, it would be a control in amount of BTC that moves on every block, but I was wrong, it is not the case, there is no throttle with BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:59:38
thanks for that. so its a throttle or just crazy mass fomo, who knows anyway?
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:12:06
the time is always now.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:46:26
I see communication skills is one of your strengths.
Good for you!
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:49:18
Is this the best they could come up with?
this is rather lame and not even a prank.
@_date: 2018-09-20 18:46:12
I has  actually laughing by the time I got to the last 2  graphs.
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:19:33
I would be worried if this happen in the US, Europe or Japan (maybe South Korea too). We know Russia is an autocratic country and this news are to be expected (I mean, anything can happen in Russia).
To me, it is the same as if North Korea seized the Bitcoin ATM.
I could not care less.
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:57:33
How is this important and relevant?
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:41:06
there is a sub I recently discover.... or something like that.
That is the only reason I doubt your 0%.
After visiting that sub once, I am convinced I can no longer know what is possible or not anymore regarding crazy people doing crazy stuff....
bottom line, there is always a chance.
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:21:27
It doesn't work, does it?
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:25:23
ok now I get the Brint thing at least. I was afraid to ask, lol.
thanks for the video.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:37:19
World's "first".
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:45:38
make it happen
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:14:06
Next please:
Seoul, Tokyo, Moscow, New York, Mexico City, Paris and London. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:24:23
How big is the bank? is it like a little one based on a tiny town or a national one?
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:19:38
thanks, but the yuan is artificially under valued... anyway, I meant against the Euro or Yuan, whatever.
Are you saying that the dollar is bullet proof against a devaluation?
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:05:49
you get its a joke, right?
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:33:12
It is ok. We can agree to disagree. I am being downvoted, so obviously my sense of humor is not matching Reddit right now. 
I am ok with that. I can take some downvotes.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:12:16
I do. But some jokes do not work after the original. I could joke they DO look like 180 and you could say NO, but it ain't funny anymore, is it?
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:57:25
dammit! 
Am I not getting any jokes today?  :P
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:49:56
No I wasn't. 
This Redditor said "they do not look like 180" and I said that the post was a joke since it doesnt really show 180 lines.
Are we still arguing about this?  
I get it, I was a grinch saying it was not funny (the comment, not the post), shame on me. I can eat that. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:52:37
I like the meme, but no upvote because its advertisement.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:36:10
I already have the perfect [chicken dance]( for our ritual.
Any new member is required to learn the ritual.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:11:23
I do. But some jokes do not work after the original. I could joke they DO look like 180 and you could say NO, but it ain't funny anymore, is it?
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:58:50
I fear that.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:15:40
but why is it "the worst"?
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:51:03
No, I have been in a country which had a strong devaluation.
The problem is your debts and imports which you get from foreign countries. If the dollar goes down then all your imports of oil will be more expensive. Your gas station will charge you more and all goods are transported with using oil (freights, planes etc). Not to mention, fertilizers (I think, not sure) affecting your apples. 
Then all imports from China would be more expensive, but I didn't mean to go into economics so deep.
Ok it is not that deep but still...
Having a weaker dollar, would that be an incentive to buy and use more bitcoin?
Maybe it is just a stupid question at the end, I am ok with that. I do not care to embarrass myself  :P
I wouldn't be asking if I were an expert.
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:01:51
Maybe collapse was to big for a word. But as I mention, like a 20% depreciation. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:58:56
'cause they screw you?
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:22:45
Get the fuck off Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:15:37
should we make a club or better, a sub?
we can order pizza and skype on the weekends.
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:59:45
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:57:06


nevermind, that explains a lot.
congrats on 2K!!
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:40:07
I am sure Satoshi totally agrees with you /s.
@_date: 2019-03-06 16:22:49
B, mB, and uB is all we need.
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:09:17
wow. it must feel good to be you.
Anyway, I got other ways to waste my time, so this was it for my. bike.
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:59:02
how did we did anything? they obviously are rooting for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-11 06:37:12
what about right now!! it just went down like... BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:10:14


@_date: 2018-10-24 07:43:18
just remember than more than 99% of the population does not own any bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:20:59


wouldn't it be "can" instead of "can't"?
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:39:59
as an investment, I doubt it, maybe.
as anything else, no.
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:30:36
what do you want to regulate?
and is the currency is decentralized, who would regulate it?
and how?
@_date: 2018-10-01 10:16:17
Yes! Make this happen!
@_date: 2018-10-10 06:34:09
Im downvoting you for telling me what to do, I don't care what you say.
no other reason.
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:23:04
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:20:52
how can you regulate a wallet if you can write your own since it is open source?
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:51:04
Fuck off. 
You can't take a joke yourself?
oh I see. Your must upvoted post, now you are drunk in Karma. Imagine if you ever get +5K votes! What kind of person will you become? 
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:39:54
exchanges can be regulated I agree, but wallets? I don't know and I do not see how.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:31:15
no! I mean, we buy LOW and sell HIGH, not the other way around.
Lol, I did not even see the By thing, haha.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:28:23
is it not John, Jon and Jo'n Sun?
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:33:25
They are using [Copyright]( material.
And fuck the overcontrolling EU
oh shit, are the letters EU also copyright?
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:18:28
I have losts the contents of external HDs and USBs, so there is that. 
I do not trust those.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:00:47
I need a bit more than that.
You are saying the obvious but it is not so obvious for me. Is there like an ELI5 video for that?
And thanks!!! I will take my BTC out as soon as I learn to keep them safe out of there.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:38:34
I am SURE those emoticons are copyright.
We might get fucked someday for having conversations.
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:46:45
its not the 21 Million Club. I think there are like 100 people with some 10 million of then an I am making that up.
Someone might do the math on this one.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:35:55
They get my upvote, you dont.
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:54:23
But is this [Copyright](
And fuck the overcontrolling EU
oh shit, are the letters EU also copyright?
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:02:12
Did you think that yourself or is it really a copyright thought?
Damn, I hope no one has ever had that thought before.
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:50:09
following.... let me know how when you know how. At the moment, i have all my BTC on a website but I should learn that cold storage or offline or something.
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:13:37
as far as I have heard, no you can't.
Profits? tax them!
Loses? we don't care.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:21:40
thank you so much.
my problem is that I have lost HD and USB sticks etc, I know I can loose my information.
what would really help me is an ELI5 like video, like a video for dummies. I do not care to admit that I need a video for dummies when it comes to my BTC.
and thanks again.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:00:38
Im sure it doesnt.
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:50:17
Blockchain kills any evil, even FBs.
All I say, there has to be a way for this to work.
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:52:49
I have no idea what all this is.
yeah, lighting network, this seems like it would be familiar to people being admins of nodes or something similar?  dont take me wrong, engineer here, but regarding bitcoin I only trade, have little idea about this kind o conversation, never read anything like this.
ELI5 anyone?
also, have never used lnd that I know, I mean, could something like this happen to me? what is going on?
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:33:52
thanks! a lot!
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:16:09
how did Asagne kick the nest?
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:15:36
you can't **show off** Bitcoins
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:14:48
At least the diamond will not loose value.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:13:15
This is awesome and has kind of the wrong title.
I find nice the National Suicic... Prevention Lif... screen on the right side.
But what about the guy on the left? Must be a Bitcoin Guru and I don't know him (live with it, 99.9% of people are not super hardcore bitcoin wise men/women).
What would I put on the left side? Maybe something like a Lambo that never happen? like the dream is slipping away?
no idea why this post has so few upvotes, this is brilliant.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:14:15
you got the cookie for the least effort mirror ever, lol.
next time try just the screen and not the whole room.
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:13:13
Who was it? who among you sold/bought this house?
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:22:55
what happens when there is no more bitcoin to mine? are the fees going to be huge? how will the system pay for itself?, i mean, the power to maintain the blockchain has to be paid somehow, doesnt it?
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:17:01
I like that with the difficulty going down, makes sense.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:31:07
even better!!
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:32:00


my common sense says China is not printing money, so you are wrong. There are no news saying "China is not printing money" because those are not news. Printing money, that is news. so, where is the source other than your imagination?
And if they do print money (every country does), are thy printing an outstanding amount of money because of Trumps tariffs? or are they printing money (IF they are) at the same rate they do any other time of the decade?
common sense is not a source. It is an attempt to manipulate readers into believing what ever your fantasy is.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:01:45
I need a truly ELI5 for how to do and keep an offline wallet safe.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:31:12
that. looks. awesome.
why is that not like on the rights column? maybe it is, lol.
thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:52:45
no he is not. And no. Thanks but no thanks.  If you do not have a source you are spreading misinformation. You are part of the problem.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:43:14
I didn't find any (quick) source yet. Again, do you have a source saying China is printing money?
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:43:28


@_date: 2019-05-14 13:44:44


@_date: 2019-05-15 18:47:02
oh please make the front page.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:33:58
like Trump says? "Trust me", "Its true", etc... just because he says so?
I dont trust you. find a source, like a reliable one, not your uncle's opinion or yours.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:55:34
what intelligence? and past experience? what does that even mean? you have past experience on printing money?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:22:40
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:20:24
Can I have a 10 hour loop? but fuk the Lambo, i want a Van to travel the world.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:23:05
lol, were you not here like 18 months ago when it up side fall to 18K?
then it was a 3K again and oh boy, many of us still hodl.
