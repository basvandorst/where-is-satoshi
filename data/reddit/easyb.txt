You weren't "Coinbased", you were "BSA/AMLbased". Coinbase isn't requiring this info for shits and giggles, they are required to have sufficient KYC on customers doing certain volumes, whether it's buys/sells/bitcoin transactions.
You people need to stop getting mad at Coinbase, you need to start getting mad at the regulations/lawmakers that are forcing them to enforce these policies.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:26:20
More of this nonsense?  Coinbase and Circle have done more to get bitcoin to the masses than any other companies, and Coinbase offers a multi-sig wallet where you control 2 of the 3 keys.
Yes, you can and should hold your own bitcoin. Yes, you can do this on Coinbase with no fear of them stealing them.
Enough with the FUD, do your research.

Should be fairly easy. Start a 501(c)(3), accept BTC donations, use BTC to buy [VPS nodes](
Or you can just [set one up yourself]( I did, cost me $19 a year, and I haven't touched it in months.

I seriously doubt that since they were the first company Comcast screwed over with their anti-net neutrality rules. Netflix stands to lose the most if net neutrality goes away.

I did read the site. I'm not saying it's a scam, just that "Win a home" in the title makes it sound like it's free to enter. "Enter a raffle to win a home" would have been more transparent.

Win a home? This isn't a sweepstakes, it's a raffle. With a min reserve of 101,626 you stand to collect at least 1016.26 BTC. So each entry has, at best, a 1 in 101,626 chance of winning.
Thanks, but no thanks.

This is understandable, and nothing to get all shocked and disappointed about(silly headline). Bitcoin is still young, and really only interesting to tech, investor, and financially-minded people. There is no incentive for the average person off the street to care about what Bitcoin is, let alone worry about using it.
This will slowly get better(I hope) as more and more companies are funded that make Bitcoin more accessible to the masses.
tl;dr: Nothing surprising here. Give it some time.

centOS is perfectly fine. Most people mention Ubuntu because it's the gold standard for linux noobs, but centOS is equally easy to install and just as secure as Ubuntu is out of the box.

Highly unlikely. What are the details? Were you making a transfer? Selling? Did you have 2FA turned on?

Calm down, these tips are totally bogus. Changetip transactions occur off the blockchain, so as soon as these 2 guys try to withdraw those tips they'll get rejected.

Wrong. It states in the [user agreement]( very plainly that gambling is against the TOS. Like everyone else here is saying, Coinbase has to tread lightly and not give the gov't any reason to break out the banhammer, including people that openly admit to using their services to engage in illegal activity.
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:34:12
They have multiple freerolls daily, good interface. US players accepted.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:50:38
You do understand that in order to sell them someone has to be willing to buy them, right?
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:58:06

Would be fun to get tipping going here like they do over at dogecoin. I set up a wallet there and just tip out whatever I get in, it's like walking in circles in the forest: you never get anywhere, but there's still something kind of great about it.

Friday is fried chicken day! The local steakhouse does fried chicken for lunch, but only on fridays. It's seriously the best fried chicken on the planet. I feel like a kid again on pizza day when you used to get those little rectangular pizzas for lunch. I don't know what I'm talking about anymore.

You say savvy, I say lucky


So, seeing what has happened in the past vs what will happen in the future?

So by your logic if I look at the history of NFL scores, and hang out with enough fans of the game, I can win money betting on NFL games. But that wouldn't be gambling, of course.

With a large enough SD card? Sure. But I wouldn't. SD cards aren't the best at being re-written repeatedly, so you'd probably have to replace the card pretty often.

Trading is gambling in it's oldest form. Until a mind-reading invention is dropped on the world, it will always be gambling. People use all kinds of mental gymnastics to argue otherwise, but there's never been any proven system to make money trading other than buying and holding long term.

In dollars, it depends on what hardware you have available. In time, 30 minutes to a couple of hours, again depending on your hardware availability. If you're serious PM me. I'd be happy to help you get a node up and running.
