Thanks, very true.  I think one will come up soon enough on this sub.

yes.  I should probably smoke some more cannabis sativa and then read your comment again at 3 am.   
She asked me to find someone to talk to, so i figured this would be the best place to find someone who knows that someone.

I hear ya.  I do find it funny how people think losing a few thousand dollars constitutes divorce.  I'm pretty sure divorces are more expensive than that....plus she wouldn't have the funds to divorce me ;)  I would be much more concerned about waking up with my eyebrows shaved off and my babies gone, G-d forbid!

right, so that's exactly what I did, but making money didn't impress her.  She really needs to hear someone say it's smart.
I honestly thought if I just show her that would be enough.

right, for sure. We had no plans to invest all in one crypto, especially BTC.  Honestly I don't think it was even in my mind.  I'm curious why stocks would be safer/as safe as a diverse crypto portfolio.  Maybe I'm just pessimistic but it seems pretty obvious we are in the bubble to end all bubbles on the NYSE.  She doesn't have a ton of risk tollerance, but at the same time, she isn't the kind of person who would check on her investments more than once a quarter.  I would most likely be the one monitoring.  It's an assumption, but it's based on me knowledge of her financial cares in the past haha.

What are you referrring to? Sorry I'm new to the sub.

right, the FOMO doesn't seem to bother her, she's a unique one, especially since I recommending BTC when it was around 1k....Either she lives very in the present ( I wish she did) or she really just gives 0 sh1ts.
