Bitfloor's website won't work on the Android browser?
That's rather a nuisance not to be able to do all this from a tablet at the bank.
edit: looks like firefox works on android though.
edit: sending $5000 from BOFA to bitfloor took less than 5 minutes to show up in my bitfloor account ready to buy BTC.
edit: but BTC transfered from bitfloor to mtgox took over an hour
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:45:12
Bitcoinity has [this feature]( but you're talking about changing the mtgox api to not return those trade data.

So BTCGuild got a disproportionate # of the first ASICs?
What happens if a country/company designs an ASIC that far outperforms all others, and keeps them all for itself?
Chinese willingly self-censor their own internet; why wouldn't they control the world's bitcoins through a Chinese guild?

That url seems easy to get wrong:

MtGox changed it's ticker url recently from/to:
I edited my windows bitcoin gadget's source code with new url and it works fine.  There might be newer gadgets updated soon though.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:36:46
ya ya, but still i wonder whether those few first adopters can manipulate the market with their huge numbers of BTC.
what % of BTC do the top 10 owners hold?

What if the bubble bursting is fiat money, and the exit strategy is buying crypto currency (or gold)?
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:55:11
Would it make sense to hire the botnet, to make a list of the infected bots to send to their ISP's, so the victims know to clean their computers?
@_date: 2013-03-23 02:31:02
*Equally, as Finextra friend Dave Birch remarks on Twitter: "This is completely stupid. Why would you take odds of 9/4 instead of just buying the Bitcoins?"*
for the headline drawing people to the site

Maybe a reason for their restraint was for time to work out an exchange system.

end of bubble, back to DMA of ~50?

So what does gox do with the identity information, provide the US government with all funds and transaction data?
@_date: 2013-03-12 17:43:13
- I have no confidence my money held in bitcoins will be worth roughly the same tomorrow.
- It seems right now Bitcoin is completely dependent upon other currencies for judgement of worth when making purchases.  A calculator or webpage bitcoin/fiat comparison is always needed.  When will that stop being true?  When will we be comfortable thinking to ourselves "0.0236 bitcoins? That's a fair price."
- Who are these developers that brought the system down with a message?  Who elected them :)   Lets hope they and their heirs will continue to be ... good, whatever countries they come from.

It was a message from one (?) person, that could be faked (or worse), and had enormous consequence as do press releases from the Fed chairman.
I'm not saying they're bad; I really appreciate their efforts.  But if you're looking for vulnerabilities in the system, that seems like one.

There's the problem and solution.
