For some reason i always managed to pick the lows. I simply stopped buying above 250 and kept buying below that. No rocket science i guess.

That's not how it works. How about you show us proof that Cyprus had anything to do with the price rise.
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:29:33
How about alt-coins? Were there no alt-coins that did better?
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:41:37
Uh yes, fake volume can totally make the price go up. How can you possibly claim otherwise?
@_date: 2016-01-08 11:46:41
What are no alt-coins included?
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:56:18
I bought from 20 to 250 over the years. Can't complain. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:54:00
Why don't you include alt-coins??
@_date: 2016-01-08 11:34:37
The best way to get free coins? No idea. Probably in the same way you would get free money. Do you know some people who will give you free money maybe?

Translation - someone phished me and accessed my account.

What makes you think this money goes into Bitcoin? What is this based on? So far in the 7 years of its existence there hasn't been 1 verified case of people moving to Bitcoin after a market crashing. How has this suddenly turned into a certainty according to this sub?
Excuse me but why am i being downvoted. I post on the Bitcoin forum and i'm not sure how things work here. So why does my post get downvoted. I thought it was to eliminate spam or off topic stuff?

Please tell me you are 15.

Or whale traders pumping the price just to dump later. 
One of these 3 scenarios has been happening 200 times. Yet for some reason is never really an option when the price goes up. Guess which one.

Welcome to the free market. If you want things to change then go ahead.

Megaton? Nasdaq?
Why is this crap upvoted to the top?
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:05:05
No need to :)
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:53:27
But you demand that others provide proof. Of something that doesn't exist.

Let's pick a random chart and compare it to Bitcoin because reasons.

Why are there no alt-coins included?
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:00:39
It isn't?
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:14:08
Of which 800k times in the Bitcoin subs?
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:54:14
They have been leading pretty much non-stop for what, 2 months now? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:36:38
Could the reason be that 99.9999% of the planet doesn't use Bitcoin? Just a wild guess.
