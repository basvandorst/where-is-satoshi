Great. $400 down the fucking hole. Well I guess it's no ones fault but my own.

I think we're on two different pages here. My problem is that I downloaded ElectSum, generated wallets on the App, and transferred money into one of them. Now I can't even access those wallets on ElectSum, it says the blockchain data is unavailable, and the wallets are undefined. And I haven't been able to access it on Electrum at any point. The only thing that I can see right now is the blockchain. Basically all I have at this point is the wallet address. Did I just make a costly mistake today? I'm worried I did. Is there any way at all to access it, even through hacking or something? At this point I'm desperate.

I don't quite understand? I just copied and pasted my PGP public key into the master public key box in Electsum, and it generated those wallets. And I transferred the bitcoin into one of those generated wallets. How can I access those wallets via Electrum now so I can actually access the bitcoin?

Fuck you man I've been successfully using the DNM for 3 years with no issues but I just wanted to tumble my coins and got the stupid ELECTsUM mixed up with Electrum, somewhat. It's not like I'm some fucking idiot. I did it today at work on my phone cause I was in a rush to get these coins moving. Yeah I lost $400, the people over at bitcointalk.org actually helped me figure out exactly what happened. The fact that ELECTsUM even allowed a GPG key to be used for a master public key is fucked up because that's some seriously shitty coding.

So I created those wallets using my PGP key, which I have. But when I try to select new/import on Electrum and paste the wall of text that is my key into the box, the 'next' button remains gray and unclickable?

But will this grant me access to the electsum wallet that I transferred the bitcoins initially? I've generated a new set of wallets (if that's what you call them) on electrum. Now what would the next step be? Sorry, I'm very unfamiliar with using stuff like this.
