That's super neat! I tried searching bitcoin like 2 or 3 months ago and there was nothing.

First let me say I think the original blockchain protocol of Bitcoin, if used correctly, is the best form of secure long term value yet. It'll be hard to find a protocol that offers better security than Bitcoin does. That's its role and it does it well. 
Ethereum, if successful, would be more like the type of protocol that is used in most day to day goings on with Bitcoin acting as the "gold" of crypto currencies.
Another one I'm super excited about is Ripple. I know I'll get downvoted in this sub for even bringing it up, but Ripple does most of what Ethereum wants to do and it's already in usable beta. Miles ahead of Ethereum in terms of development and paving the way for full fledged digital financial applications.
Bitcoin has made its mark on the future, it'll be hard to usurp its throne, and there's really no need to. Contrary to popular opinion on here, there's very little chance that bitcoin will be the one and only currency in our future. There's too many financial roles that need to be filled that bitcoin is just not optimized for.
I'll be keeping a close eye on these second gen currency protocols like Ripple, Ethereum, Mastercoin, and Namecoin, because unlike most alt coins (LTC, DOGE, ICE, and the tens of other blockchain 1.x coins) gen 2 currencies bring something new to the table. Something necessary even. That is why they will have the potential to succeed where LTC and the like probably won't.
TL;DR Downvote me bringing up Ripple.

Bitcoin is not a stock but you could argue it kind of acts like one. Really though there's been nothing like Bitcoin before, but you can still apply a lot of the logic found in that old ass book from 1920 about a stock operator. It's a very good read for trading of any kind.

Wtf? Why do these two points still hold weight against Ripple?
First, XRP is NOT pre-mined. XRP is not mined at all! It is a math based currency that is completely different from the way bitcoin works. 100 billion XRP were created with the original ledger by OpenCoin. When OpenCoin gave control over the whole thing to Ripple Labs they kept 20 billion XRP. Ripple Labs say they are going to distribute 50 billion XRP to the public as fairly as possible through giveaways (Computing for Good is a big one) and keep 30 billion XRP for themselves to fund investors, build infrastructure, and of course to profit. Ripple Labs is a for profit company. It's actually a pretty genius business model.
All that being said, XRP is intended solely as an anti DDOS measure for the ledger. It costs a tiny fraction of an XRP to change the ledger in any way (make orders, set trust lines, etc.) This amount of XRP is so small that it won't really affect the average person, but it quickly puts a halt to anyone trying to send millions of ledger changes a second.
Now the second point, Ripple is NOT centralized. Far from it. Ripple uses distributed servers to verify the network, and it is true that Ripple Labs controls the majority of these verifying servers right now, but the server code was only open sourced in September! ANYONE can act as a Ripple verification server. It's just gonna take time.
If you think Ripple Labs or OpenCoin are just going to sell out all their shares to make a quick buck, you are woefully wrong. The absolutely spectacular potential of the whole system is immense. 
There's so much more to Ripple than XRP.
For anyone who got turned off by that whole RippleScam.org thing a few months ago READ THIS ARTICLE 
Ripple has made leaps and bounds in just the last few months alone and it's still in Beta! I see great promise in the system.
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:57:05
The point I was touching on, is that Ripple solved double spending with a system of consensus that doesn't require an insane amount of computing power and, in turn, electricity; especially into the future as mining difficulty increases. To do so requires a web of trust, as you said. 
That can be considered a disadvantage to some and an advantage to others for various reasons, I'll admit. Another reason for Ripple and Bitcoin to coexist, I'd say.
Though, you could argue that power consumption is a very real potential downfall of Bitcoin for the future. The use of Proof of Stake to combat this could be an advantage for altcoins preparing for this issue like Peercoin. Ripple solved it from the get go with a completely different protocol.

It's true that you'd have to keep your keys off the internet to avoid any digital security risks. And in the first world, physical security is just better. However, with the advent of Bitcoin and the value it represents in the digital space, a sort of arms race for better security is happening. There are already several advances in decentralized security (m-of-n being a recent one) taking place and the growth will continue to be exponential. You have to understand that up until very recently decentralization and security were paradoxical concepts.
Now, all of that being said, it's not like you are 100% going to be hacked and lose all your bitcoins if you leave them on your phone or computer. There are the same limitations to it that there are to any sort of hacking. You have to be targeted by a malicious entity and there are things you can do to somewhat negate that.
There is risk though, but...


Even considering all of the above, I still believe hardware and phone wallets would be a lot more secure than carrying around commodities, physical currency, or livestock. There's going to be risks involved in carrying any value in a place that doesn't have any law enforcement to speak of. At least with digital currency it'd be protected by one or more passwords.
With Bitcoin they incur mostly the same risks, but have global access to financial services.


I'm kind of in awe of your ignorance. Even the most useful things in the world are worthless if nobody knows about it. The internet didn't just spring up overnight without any promotion whatsoever. I don't know if you're gleaning a negative connotation from the word "promotion" but it just means making more people aware. Even the most brilliant people aren't going to just *understand* Bitcoin and why it is awesome without being introduced to it.


I read this and almost decided not to reply, because at this point you're not going to change your mind regardless of any information put before you. I imagine if Bitcoin takes off and becomes a global currency and Utopia occurs, you'd be sitting outside the gates saying "I don't see the point, guys."
But I like answering questions in case some random happens across this exchange.

Perhaps an in-game currency wouldn't be the best choice, but why does it have to be a limited money supply?
What if the dev creates a huge (infinite) number of coins on the blockchain, then the game itself acts as an exchange of sorts and keeps track of the in-game currency off the blockchain and at any time you could send currency out of the game onto the blockchain to be transferred/traded/sold for real money. It might be overcomplicated, but there's no limited money supply from the dev. People can pay for in-game "gold" based on an open market. The dev just has to issue coins backed by the game itself.
Again, probably overcomplicated and in-game economics are definitely hard/impossible to control but I'm just tossing ideas around. :)

@_date: 2014-02-04 09:29:22
There are a lot of coins that add something new to the table. When people say generation 2 coins, though, I think they usually mean a coin with inherent script capability. Ethereum is one that's planned to be Turing complete, Ripple is another that currently isn't and probably won't ever be. It's hard to tell which of the two has the advantage there because Turing complete language can be less secure.
Gen 2 coins are still a ways on the horizon, but you should definitely keep up on their progress as they are just the next logical step in digital finance and will most likely run parallel to the best Gen 1 coins in the future. Ripple is getting ready to release contracts here soon and Ripple Stocks is currently in closed beta on Peercover. Ethereum is equally as exciting. Check out both!

@_date: 2014-02-04 09:52:13
Bitcoin, technically, could do a lot more than it does right now. I think, though, that Bitcoin has one major thing going for it that won't be improved upon for a while by any other currency. Security.
That security is essential to Bitcoin's success. The more applications that are tacked on to the protocol to add functionality, the less secure it becomes. If that functionality is your goal, it makes more sense to create a platform from scratch that can handle such functions better, and leave the simplicity and security to Bitcoin.
Just my two cents though.

Honestly, Ripple is genius. It solves the double spend problem through the use of distributed consensus without the need for miners who draw incredible amounts of power (and even more as time goes on). Here's a few ([fully debunked]( reasons, though, why Ripple is looked down upon by the general Bitcoin community.
Some people hold the view that Bitcoin is the one and all, the all being supreme digital coin that will revolutionize currency by itself. This is approaching fanaticism. As such, any competition is bad. Ripple is a pretty big "competitor," so it gets a lot of flak. I just don't get that mindset. It's obvious that bitcoin has some pretty big flaws and can't do EVERYTHING. Up to 10 minute or more confirmation times alone are enough to halt bitcoin in its tracks for day to day transactions like the grocery store or a coffee shop. There's going to be multiple digital currencies in our future.
Ripple is built with an inherent medium of exchange called XRP (ripples). XRP is not a currency to take bitcoin's place, it is used in a very clever way to prevent ledger spam and DDOS attacks. It's also special in that it doesn't require a counterparty to exchange on the Ripple network. Now here's where it starts throwing people off, when the original ledger was created, 100 billion XRP were created along with it. There will never be more made and they are being destroyed at a near constant rate through dust transaction fees (the same ones that prevent ledger spam abuse.) The original creators of the Ripple protocol kept 20 billion XRP and gave 80 billion to the for profit company now in control of the system called Ripple Labs. Ripple Labs intends to fairly distribute 50 billion XRP through giveaways to the general public and use the remaining 30 billion to facilitate infrastructure expansion, fund investors, make a profit for themselves, etc. That's the biggest reason people call it a scam. Oh Ripples are pre mined! The companies and people who spent the better part of a decade building a protocol unlike any other want to make a profit? SCAM!&gt;&gt;&gt;!!1!&gt;1
The thing is, money is the biggest driving force behind innovation. It's just true. Can you really blame a for-profit company like Ripple Labs for wanting to make money with all the effort they're putting into a very risky venture?
Last reason I'll go over is decentralization. Ripply is currently NOT decentralized, but widely distributed. While Ripple Labs did open source the server code at the end of September, the majority of servers are still owned and operated by Ripple Labs. Let me repeat, though, the server code is open source. That means anyone can set up and run a validation server at this point. With Ripple still in beta though, version updates are frequent, and with the system of consensus required to update the protocol, it makes sense for Ripple Labs to control most of the servers so they can push out updates with little hassle. At least for now. Once the validation servers become more and more distributed, Ripple Labs will have absolutely no control over the protocol without the validation of every other server. Eventually, in this way, Ripple will approach decentralization but never really quite BE decentralized.
Like I said before, I'm a fan of Bitcoin as well. It has its purpose and I own some myself, but my bet is on Ripple (or something very similar to it).

Finite resources would be another possibility! Maybe ultra rare or event items or something that you could say are "yours" and show everyone the blockchain and even sell them that way.
I played Ultima Online for about a decade, there is most certainly great demand for unique and event items of history in long-running MMOs and people pay top dollar. Richard Garriott, creater of the Ultima series and UO, has said he was fascinated that "people were willing to pay real money for pixels on a screen" and I'm sure he must have entertained the thought, but selling items for real money was still against ToS for numerous reasons. Nevertheless, gold and items were and are still sold for money on third party sites. UO had some issues with item duplication which ultimately ruined the economy in my opinion, the same happened to Diablo 3's Real Money auction house. You give an incentive to make real money and people will cheat the system. But can they cheat blockchain so easily?
Could blockchain potentially be used to help prevent item duplication in MMOs where certain rare items can be worth staggering amounts of both in-game and real currency anyways?
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:45:31
I've seen this before! It's interesting because the game itself is the mining process, which requires time and effort from participants, giving HUC value in that regard. Very cool idea but more of a mining process with a game attached to it than what I'm thinking.
For my trading card example, I had this idea that a custom blockchain along with a wallet (possibly the game client itself) could derive all of it's "mining" power from the game client/wallet itself while the user was playing as well as dedicated servers. Of course difficulty would be really low so the CPU draw would be minimal. This should be enough to do all the verifying and transactions on the blockchain and for no reward/fees as cards/coins would be released in sets and booster packs by the dev.

Boom. This. Dogecoin was a good idea in the sense that it allowed a bunch of people who might not have even known about cryptocurrencies otherwise to get into this new territory and learn and, hey, even have fun. But as soon as that whole market control debacle started, I knew Dogecoin was fucked. It'll probably stick around for a while, but it brings very little new to the table regarding the protocol itself, so it's hard to expect success in something like a cryptocurrency through nothing more than some meme fanaticism.

Okay, I can think of several reasons why Bitcoin is awesome for us first world folk but if you've been lurking this subreddit I'm sure you've heard them all before. 
However, even if none of that appeals to you, that's fine because you are right that cash and debit cards work *well enough* for most people. Barring the political side of things, we have an established banking system that does its job for the average consumer.
Now, what about third world countries that don't have any of that? Proliferation of cell phone and internet technologies will happen faster than banking systems.

What really drew me to it in the first place was using human interaction and time to mine a currency rather than solving algorithms with hardware.

@_date: 2014-06-01 12:12:45
Well, if you assume that the risk of bitcoins losing all/most value is outweighed by the potential upside that they will inevitably increase in value, you have to assume there IS that chance that it could just tank. So that's kind of a fancy way of saying "only invest what you can afford to lose" isn't it? You're only putting in what you'd be comfortable losing or willing to sacrifice, your extra spending money. I assume that from the way you applied Pascal's Wager, which made me chuckle because it epitomizes the phrase in question.
Is it a connotation thing? Is it bad because the word "lose" is part of the phrase? I don't get it. It's solid advice. If you lost your investment would you be in a bad spot?
No one is denying the absolute utility of blockchain, that's a given, but to assume that there is zero risk in speculating on Bitcoin is absurd. Any number of unforeseeable things could happen that'd either devalue bitcoins or cause you to lose them.
I'm a firm believer in blockchain and Bitcoin and think it's here to stay, but I'd never tell people there is zero risk to speculation because we can't know with certainty what might happen to Bitcoin. Therefore, only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:54:47
It's true that you're not getting the decentralized benefit of blockchain with a centralized game. I had this realization a while back and figured it probably would curb a few potential ideas, but along with scarcity is the transparency. This must have a use case somewhere in online gaming.

I understand it's the same regardless of the underlying asset. I also understand how capital gains is applied.
My question was more regarding which tax bracket would be used when cashing in large amounts of a long-term asset all at once. allgoodthings1 summed it up nicely in that your tax bracket is based on your net income for the year. I guess I didn't realize capital gains would affect your current income tax bracket, but looking back it makes total sense.
@_date: 2014-02-03 11:32:55
You're right. Ripple isn't Turing complete as far as I know ([here's the language Ripple uses for contracts]( and I guess I misspoke when I said it can *already* do most of what Ethereum wants to do, but as a financial platform, Ripple probably doesn't need full Turing-completeness and it could be better off without it. Ethereum is taking on a pretty big risk to security with that move. But they might have a solution that I don't know about..
It's all pretty interesting and I plan to include some Ether in my portfolio either way. I feel like we're starting to see names that in 20-30 years will be as big as Google or Ebay today.

@_date: 2014-09-25 03:19:51
That does make sense and is kinda what I figured would happen, however couldn't this still be circumvented to some degree?
An example: I've been a part of the workforce paying income tax for years. Over time I've managed to accumulate 1000 BTC but have never cashed out. For the sake of this argument, say I quit my job at the start of the taxable year making my taxable income effectively zero. Could I then cash out up to $36k (second bottom tax bracket) worth of bitcoin either all at once or over the course of the year and incur 0% capital gains?
I realize it's kind of a narrow question that won't benefit most people, but what's to stop someone from quitting their job when they know they have enough bitcoin (or gold, or stocks, etc) in storage to sustain themselves year to year other than volatility?
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:39:43
Right on, I wish I had started developing my programming skills sooner but I definitely intend to work on it. I've wanted to get into game creation for a while and found a keen interest in blockchain technology.

@_date: 2014-02-04 11:57:57
Interesting idea. From what I've seen of Ethereum and Ripple, they are, at their basic level, distributed databases capable of supporting applications written in a native scripting language. That means they do basically what you just said.
Using Ripple as an example because it's my favorite of the two, the first application built on the protocol was the payment system. Running alongside will be Contracts. Who knows what will come? I see it as being a modular financial system and Bitcoin will have a perfect role to fill within it. It can be the ultra secure, out of network currency for whichever of these next gen financial platforms wins out and becomes ubiquitous.
