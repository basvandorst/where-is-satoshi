Saying you haven't twisted anything isn't evidence that you haven't twisted anything.

You're wrong. It's because you are blinded by always thinking you are right, and bend peoples rational points into something that you can dispute.

Your name and replies so far lead me to believe you are the type of person who thinks that when people stop arguing with them, they've won. It's actually because they are insufferable. But i read through some of you comments and you don't actually seem to be like that, so i apologize. But saying "he's being convicted of a crime he hasn't been tried for" isn't a really reasonable statement. He was convicted of the crimes he was convicted for, and then the judge has a specific range of punishment for that crime in which to take account for severity and any other  relevant intangibles. You could argue that every law should have an absolute sentence, but every case is different so you would have some people getting more or less time than the likely deserve. Even though they had plenty of evidence to possibly convict him of murder for hire, they didn't need that conviction.

Nothing is ever “the whole story”. That’s a dangerous belief, and is a huge problem.

A lot don’t, which is what I was getting at. Just look at Facebook, people will believe fucking anything...

I’d say the hard part is knowing what “enough” is.

Sorry I’m all defensive, I’m getting attacked in another post for saying that Comparing the taste of a food over a beverage is weird.

Really? I’m not attempting to be deep, it’s just a counter statement...

How? The phrase “the whole story” means literally that...
