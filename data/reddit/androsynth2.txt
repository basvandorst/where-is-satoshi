Beautifully put, as usual.

If you think wanting to use it as currency makes you a target for ridicule in this subreddit, try telling people that it's nearly impossible to truly guarantee the secrecy of a private encryption key. The bitcoin subreddit is a dazzling testament to human ignorance. Just a bunch of get-rich-quick scheming know-it-alls with no humility, circle jerking about their own incredible technological foresight.

Ah, sure, you're covered. Unless you happened to buy a large amount on the day the exchange went poof. So your advice is for people to play hot potato with the exchanges. Reducing risk, but not eliminating it. If, after all that, you happen to be the guy who has it blow up in his face to the tune of a very large sum, then and only then is it not your fault. Right? Makes sense.

9000% gain? Depends who you are. If your wallet file was corrupted, or you accidentally sent your coins to the wrong address, or you screwed up the change address on your paper wallet, or you made the mistake of buying takeout with your bitcoins on the wrong day in that period, or you had your coins stolen in one of the *myriad* ways that people have them stolen, then you likely suffered a massive loss. Bitcoin is a volatile substance, not a currency.
Why, the absolute and irrevocable destruction of bitcoins during the last 4 years, due to some of the above listed reasons, is the only reason the price is as high as it is today. Supply is being limited by peoples' personal fuckups. For gold to experience a similar phenomenon its atoms would have to be rapidly decaying into heat and less rare materials.
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:41:40
I like you. I hope you buy as many bitcoins as you can afford.

Bond holders are not the same thing as the central bank. Bond holders can be big banks, but they can also be foreign governments, corporations, or people saving money for a rainy day. Mutual funds in peoples' retirement accounts around the world buy government debt. Governments are large entities, and their debt is generally thought to be a lot safer than consumer or corporate debt. So someone who lent money to Greece had a pretty reasonable expectation that they'd get their principal investment back. Not in this case, though, it seems. What's amazing to me is how many people think a default does anything other than shift the pain from Greece to someone else.

But the main driver of inflation is increases in the cost of labor. i.e. across the board increases in peoples' wages. If wages are going up across the board and someone doesn't negotiate to receive the same for themselves, that's unfortunate, but it's not a systemic issue.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:54:00
I agree with everything you said, except:


How so? If you're someone who has nothing but debt, currency devaluation is your best friend, because you're repaying a debt with cheaper Euros than you originally borrowed. If you have 0 net worth, your pay probably increases as the devalued currency causes the cost of labor to rise, making it a wash. I would think only savers actually suffer a loss. At least in theory..
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:04:30
Your argument holds no merit whatsoever. Even if the money is printed up by the central bank, moneyprinting  serves to reduce the value of Euros presently in circulation. It's robbing value from savers, which makes it effectively a tax that hits only the frugal.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:32:33
You're absolutely right. It's a shame bitcoin is so convenient to perform transfers with, because it sure has a huge impact on security.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:19:15
I stand corrected. hm.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:37:49
A search of this subreddit for the word "stolen" suggests it's not the exception. Sure, there's a lot people could do to enhance their bitcoin security. But nothing's a guarantee. How well do you know the people who wrote the software that manages your wallet? Or the intelligence agents with the backdoor keys to your computer? The only way to be really sure is to translate everything to binary by hand, do your own hashing and encryption on paper, and electrically compose the network packets to send the ones and zeroes to another peer manually, and then atomize all of the work you did on paper. With bitcoin all it takes is someone compromising one element of your security, once, and they can take everything. In all likelihood, you'll never know who they are or how they did it.

Full control of your PC means 2FA doesn't apply to him. He's already logged in as you.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:37:30
Ignore all the morons telling you that you made a mistake. Hindsight is 20/20, and this place is filled with armchair investing experts. How many of the people in this thread acting like the right decision was obvious, actually bought even a single BTC at $5 and rode it to $1000? None. So many people have lost money in BTC to theft, data loss, or poorly timed trading, although you won't find them in this subreddit any more. You doubled your money, however small the amount was - kudos on doing that. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:16:25
So you were "off the grid" sort of but you're coming back onto it?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:12:58
I agree. Security is elusive, and can only be had in degrees. But as things go, accountability is a huge security feature if you can get it. If someone does a bank transfer that you didn't authorize, the money had to go somewhere - routing numbers can be looked up, and the banks associated with them can be contacted and subpoenaed for accountholder info. Doing so, a thief can be brought to justice. The threat of justice being done is your first line of defense, and is probably what prevents most financial crimes. Multifactor authentication, encrypted communications, secure facilities, and even identity theft insurance, are all icing on the cake.
I'm curious, do you know how much companies are out there paying for peoples' private data? I always assumed those kinds of trades were done in bulk, and valued my personal data at a few cents to a few dollars, and only really for their targeted marketing potential.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:09:29
This needs more exposure. I have $20 worth of bitcoins. By his reasoning, I don't need to put any more money in at all and I'll be a millionaire in 5 years and a billionaire in 9 years. Sweet! How long before I'm a gullible idiot living in my mother's basement?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:21:07
What program do you use to put your BTC in cold storage? Who wrote that program? How well do you know that person?
More importantly, if your cold storage BTC disappeared, how would you ever get justice? How would you ever know who did it and how? If you had a suspicion, how could you ever prove that in court?
All you need is to experience one compromise, once, and you're done - all your bitcoins are gone. There are too many attack vectors to list, and yet only one of them ever needs to be successful, and your BTC will be irretrievably taken from you by an anonymous agent in god-knows-whatever part of the planet, and it'll be done within seconds, before you ever realize it's happening and without ever having any recourse.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:48:45
No no, I didn't take your response as rudeness at all. And I apologize if I come off as preachy. I'm perhaps overly paranoid, but there really are a wide array of risks that any bitcoin holder is vulnerable to.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:48:29
So what you're saying is that you're ripe for the picking.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:36:00
Seriously, you're a fucking poet. I'd give you a tip, but apparently it's impossible to do that with dollars. Well maybe not impossible, but certainly unfashionable.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:43:47
Interesting. Well, I hope it all works out for the best. At the very least, life just became a whole lot more convenient. Once you get over the initial hurdles, I mean.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:18:15
I've read this twice and I still don't quite get what's happening to you or why. Didn't pay your taxes, or something of that nature?
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:43:43
I won't bother double checking the math, but this guy is most likely right. The odds of someone guessing your key with any amount of computer hardware are impossibly low.
When your bitcoins do get stolen, it'll be because someone was screen scraping your PC, or somehow got access to a an unencrypted memory dump, or took advantage of a security flaw in a wallet program, or accessed your hard drive and cracked the encryption on your private key, or one of many, many other methods that'll lead them right to your pot o' gold. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:41
That solution works for the two of us, and for that I thank you. I'm not sure it helps the mainstream users, though.

Credit card security measures have gotten fraud rates so low that there's a free guarantee in place that the consumer will be protected against fraud related losses. Unauthorized bank account transactions are traceable, ATMs have cameras built into them, transactions can be frozen and criminals can be identified and prosecuted. There's a lot of safety built into the financial system to protect the little guy, and Bitcoin is so decentralized that it seems like it could never support such measures. Involving a third party is a liability, not a feature, in a currency where secrecy is king. That liability extends not just to companies but to your own computer or phone. How well do you know the people who made the I/O controller chip on your motherboard, how thoroughly have you reviewed the code in every program you've ever run on your PC... the more bitcoin is worth, the more incentive there is for thieves to sneak one little line of code into a product you trust, and when your financial life is in shambles, what can you do other than guess at how it happened?
It's too much for me. I wouldn't sleep well if I had any amount of money in the form of bitcoins. It's too inelastic to be currency and too easily compromised to be a store of wealth, imo. It may be a good tool for extremely short-term speculation/profit making, but I'm not a gambler, so..
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:16:39
Haha! I love this guy.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:51:13
Your posts are literally the only reason I get on reddit any more. No homo.

Bitcoins only divide into hundred-millionths. That's a problem too.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:53:42
Or even more likely, they lose track of their private key and the coins are lost to the ages.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:22:25
From the article he linked, "We have worked with Ms. Tupper and her bank to rectify her overpayment as swiftly as possible, while keeping all security and fraud protection practices in place. We are pleased that all funds are expected to be returned to the customer within the next few business days."
Man, dealing with banks and reputable service companies sure is a nightmare these days. Must be the Illuminati hard at work, omitting decimal places and adding significant digits that don't belong.

The worst compromise a bank could see against a quantum attack would probably be against its encrypted, privileged communications with clients. When compromises appear and red flags get raised, unlike Bitcoin, a bank can lock down systems, reverse transfers, call in the cavalry, and find the culprit.
That all is impossible with Bitcoin. Someone could be out there stealing bitcoins right now with a QC for all we know. There are huge BTC thefts going on every day for which explanations will never be found. Maybe some of them are victims of quantum computing attacks, in which case the Bitcoin developers tinus42 refers to are already too late. They can't be anything but late, after all they need to implement a Quantum resistant encryption that, at present, exists only theoretically. Even if there were a universally agreed upon change from ECDSA to a new encryption, it's possible that every bitcoin could have its ownership irreversibly reassigned before that change made it into effect. Whoops!

This collection of responses is telling.

Did you review code for the encryption algorithm to make sure it wasn't designed to feed you false encryption results from a short list of pre-selected addresses known only to the creator of the algorithm? Addresses that could then be looted with ease.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:42:09
Right, but if you trust a piece of code to perform the algorithm for you, and you can't read the code, it could be doing just about anything behind the scenes. I could write an algorithm that gives you a valid SHA256 output for any input you give it, and unless you look carefully, you'd never realize that the outputs were actually bogus and totally unrelated to the input. But I'd code it so it's consistent with itself, and any time you give it the same input, it gives you the same bogus output.
I'm just saying, it's possible, and there are people in this world who, craving your bitcoins, will put in the effort to do it. It'll be more or less impossible to hold them accountable when they do.
