Yeah fuck me for asking a question
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:59:25
Increasing the block size = more txns per block = lower fees
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:52:55
To say he doesnt know for certain, is a truthful answer. No one does. Anyone that tries to give you certainty in their answer is full of shit
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:11:06
Yeah definitely. Increasing the block size to allow more txs seems like a good idea
EDIT: is this what bitcoin cash is?
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:36:57
Months of high fees and long transaction times defeats the purpose of bitcoin though? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:51:04
Yeah because neither of those are good arguments hahaha
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:41:33
So you dont have time to learn the facts? Then you go on to make a false statement? Classic Shill tactics 
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:15:34
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:55:02
Yeah I know! Who else thought segwit was going to fix this???
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:13:54
As all other currencies are priced against the USD, europe will be so fucked 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:01:43
Like what?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:38:24
If only there was a way to increase the block size
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:32:32
Hey there are some other subreddits that might be helpful to you too, such as @_date: 2017-08-25 14:58:36
Bitcoin is being steered in the wrong direction. Bitcoin cash is the continuation of satoshis original vision - check out the debate between roger ver and richard heart on this
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:05:36
Increase in block size is what was needed, not segwit. Increasing block size is what has been done successfully for the last 8 years - this is what bitcoin cash is. 
Segwit was a lie
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:32:31
One of the MAIN points of bitcoin is a global currency with LOW fees. What you're talking about is even bitcoin anymore
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:13:43
I just found out!! [Lots of wallets are ready but blockstream says not to use them yet?!](
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:06:53
The block size is to small for the volume of transactions occuring in bitcoin recently. The community was told that segwit would solve this but it hasnt. The truth is that the block sizes need increased - which is what bitcoin cash is. r/btc has more talk about it
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:00:50
Maybe the block size is too small after all??

why what? did u check out the debate? clears up most of this FUD

=Bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:39:39
Great questions. There is some great videos by antreas antonopolous explaining why it is modelled like gold. [This video might help also]( which is by roger ver.
Satoshi is the **inventor** of bitcoin. He led out what it was and his plan for it in his white paper. Bitcoin has been working perfectly over the last 8 years, with increased usage the block size was increased, and this has been very successful. In his genius he led out the blueprint for what to do, and left it OPEN for everyone, and then took a step back, to allow it to grow. 
Unfortunately in recent times, blockstream has tried to diverge from the proven plan, and did not want to increase the block size. This has led to increased transaction times and fees which will only continue to increase as bitcoin becomes more popular. Bitcoin cash is essentially the increase in block size that bitcoin needed for so long, and is a continuation of the proven system that has worked so well over the last 8 years
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:52:55
[Yeah like his video on youtube about segwit and bitcoin cash]( It doesn't make any sense at all. Would recommend watching for a laugh!
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:06:31
To say it cant be cheap and fast, is to fundamentally not understand what bitcoin is. This is such an obvious shill attempt to ruin bitcoin and what its purpose is
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:20:31
I'm no expert, but knowing we are only going to get much larger, increasing the block size is inevitable. Why not just do it now??
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:05:37
This EDA business is to help BCH get of the ground, it will, and is, levelling off. 
The other sub explained that segwit will not solve the long wait times and high fees. This is exactly the situation we are in. 
There was too many transactions for the block size - an increase in block size was what was needed, which is what bitcoin cash is mate
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:00:03
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:48:50
Im talking about bitcoin cash (a.k.a BCH), not 'bcash' which is an alt coin
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:42:55
Notice how **no one** that supports bitcoin cash(BCH) calls it bcash? 
Because the only ones that do dont have a fucking clue what they are talking about

[The Federal Reserve is private](
It is owned by the Rothschilds, who own pretty much all the banks
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:40:42
mate what are you smoking. Anyone can see richard heart was the 'aggressor' in this debate, however even that is maybe an unfair label. This was a great civilised discussion
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:28:49
I thought there were endless comments here saying how Segwit will reduce transaction times and fees...and now its activated nothing has happened? How long do you think we will have to wait to see an improvement?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:10:44
The problem of high fees and slow transactions was here long before bitcoin cash came about. Now BCH is being used as a scapegoat for segwits failures. 
But yes the economics will sort this out thankfully 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:27:32
For low fees use bitcoin cash mate. Only a few cents
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:58:20
8 years of a proven track record before the fork - it actually isn't debateble unless you say before we hit the block limit of 1MB, bitcoin wasn't successful
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:55:48
So as roger ver kept reiterating, whenever bitcoin was scaling in the past, the block size would just be increased. This has been successful for 8years and is what is laid out in the original white paper
Bitcoin cash is the continuation on this. I cant believe how against the **proven** system blockstream have been  
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:01:55
Segwit was a lie. Bitcoin cash is the answer
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:31:19
Fees are low with bitcoin cash - you can't handle the facts 
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:18:44
Every statement in this is untrue. I'm honestly speechless at the shit you're trying to sell
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:26:51
Just go to 8MB
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:31:23
Bugged chain? They increased the block size, the answer all along. People have been lied about segwit
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:57:46
There should of been a discussion about increasing block sizes up from 1MB to help deal with this
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:57:20
I was asking 'how long' as a way to find a rough quantified value of 'patience'. 
One of the main points of bitcoin is a currency that is quick and cheap. I'm saddened to see this not being the case
