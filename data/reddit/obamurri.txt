what in the actual fuck
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:30:54
Why would you waste money on such crap?
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:20:43
They don't understand why it's changing! They were worried it was a multi-threading issue (those can be difficult to resolve sometimes).
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:29:44
Ya sure. Bitcoiners are out to make a buck just like everybody else
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:05:07
No need to be a cunt
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:21:43
This looks like anything you want it to look like
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:23:34
That is shit
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:28:00
Oh hi mark
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:26:07
Nonsense. You're fucking gutted. Inside, you feel like a fool. You're posting here looking for re-assurance from people who won't admit to being in the same position as you.

The original merkle tree patent was filed in 1982
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:17:30
The merkle tree was invented, and patented, by Ralph Merkle on behalf of IBM in 1982.

Champion strategy
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:06:52
Also put 'THIS IS NOT A PONZI SCHEME' there too
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:10:23
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:58:44
Ha! I love how someone is demanding something be done for free
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:11:10
Actually, it should be exactly like that
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:55:34
What this guy is missing is that volatility like that puts it in penny-stock territory. There are people who make millions from trading penny stocks, but it doesn't mean it's a good idea.

zerohedge is extra special. apart from them predicting the end of the world for 10 years now, and the editor's obvious hard-on for putin, there is occasionally an interesting article in there. I'm actually quite surprised they haven't gone full-retard on crypto yet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:22:02
Cool story bro
@_date: 2018-03-28 07:17:54
Bitcoin isn't encrypted
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:07:50
Lol, what a twat
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:44:44


LMAO. BTC is pretty much controlled by China these days. Be very careful.

There will never be a world currency, the global economies are too disparate for that to work, a prime example of this is the Euro; it works for some but is a killer for others. Bitcoin will grow more in popularity for sure, but countries will release their own digital currencies that have none of the transparency or freedoms on bitcoin. Bitcoin will, over time, be used again for mainly buying drugs.

 Motherboard is actually quite good
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:43:35
Is it a monument or an advert? The latter
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:40:30
I can't any app seriously that has "HODL" in its UI
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:38:34
Are you saying unscrupulous people are involved in the crypto hype?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:57
Yes, because when WW3 breaks out, the internet and power grid will continue to function normally.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:15:40
You should really start diversifying your remaining assets across the some of upcoming crypto ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:19:33
You can send share certificates to a broker
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:21:12
'true believers'
you all sound like scientologists
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:16:25
What the fuck are you on about? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:59:59
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:17:52
You're a total plonker
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:10:07
So is that patent
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:01:44
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:41:12
You may as well be accumulating seashells
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:20:50
Bitcoin will only be a valid form of currency when you can pay your taxes with it. Until then people will have to convert it to fiat (sell) in order to do that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:44:15
WHat... like a... a.... karmakoin?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:13:49
It's more likely to be caused by Chinese people selling due to the massive fraud that is their economy slowly becoming apparent.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:06:01
It shows a traditional bubble
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:42:08
What a twat
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:58:28
i.e PATENTS
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:20:09
Check out spread betting.

Where's 'the next wave'?
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:54:44
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:14:30
blockchain != cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:14:55
Yes, you can ask for the share certificates be sent to you for a fee
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:29:54
Except libreoffice is crap
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:06:23
Silver went parabolic and there was no next wave
