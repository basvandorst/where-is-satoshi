I think a slow fall of BTC might "save the market". Hopefully a gradual transition into more ETH or NEO, as you say. I can't see a future for BTC, at least i can't convince myself. It opened the door, but it is time to go.
Do you think crypto exchanges can be as legit as a stock market in the future? It allready feels very much like a stock market for blockchain-companies.

I have a 20 satoshi per byte fee, and its still pending on CB now since the 12th... Ugh.. Sent from Bitcoin Core wallet to CB. Anything i can do? Have contacted CB.

Did you find out more? I have the same problem with the Bitcoin Core wallet. Sent to Coinbase

Do you have an update on this? Im in the same boat. 20 sat per byte, two weeks pending on CB. Zero confirmations. Says it was received 2 days ago when i check the hash. Weird.

Im having the same problems. 13 word passphrase i wrote down, greyed out buttons. What did you do?

I fucked up, sent BTC with a 20 sat per byte. Didnt think about it really. Now it's two week pending. Thinking it's lost forever, since its not dropped or through yet. Wasnt aware how important the fees were...
Gah.. I used the Bitcoin core wallet, sent to CB. Any tips would be appreciated.

I fucked up, paid only 20 sat per byte, now its pending for two weeks. Any way to fix it? Afraid its lost. Hope it would be dropped, but still pending on CB. Sent from a Bitcoin Core wallet. Not on a PC that have the blockchain downloaded atm, will be back home in some days.

Hmm. I use Bitcoin Core wallet, sending it to my wallet in Coinbase. I see the funds pending on Coinbase since the 12th. When using Blockcypher, the hash sometimes just disappears and can't be found.

I'm on a 20 sat/byte and it has been 8 days now, with 0 confirmations. Hopefully it will go through...

Hahaha. Thanks for worrying though. I can see the long term benefits of BTC and blockchain tech. I'm just asking questions whether or not the people with billions in assets are able to just inflate the market too much now in the start before it becomes more widespread?
I mean, its probably a lot less than 1% of the population that are into cryptocurrency.
