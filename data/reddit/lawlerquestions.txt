You totally would. Bitcoin being so volatile erodes its utility in this regard. If bitcoin becomes more stable then it would be a great hedge against inflation for inflationary economies.

I thought that this article would hold more weight since it is in the WSJ, which likely does a bit more fact-checking than other outlets.

I made [this presentation]( for this very purpose - discussing Bitcoin in an intelligent way to non-technical people. It presents presents the pros, cons, and potential of Bitcoin in a very neutral stance that is easy to understand.
Feel free to use it for ideas and spread it around the community.

Fair enough, but the utility is still there. In times of hyperinflation, holding your money in a more stable store of value for even a week would help you out. Certainly this effect would be more valuable the more wealthy you are.

For those curious as to how countries with higher inflation can take advantage of bitcoin, take a look at slide 33 on this presentation I made about a month back:

I wish!

This sounds like a unilateral change to a contract, which is illegal in many jurisdictions even if the initial contract says that Cloudhashing can do this.
A good strategy for getting out of cell phone contracts used to be to wait until your text message rates were changed from $0.05 to $0.10 per message and then calling the provider to complain about a unilateral contract change. It's unfortunate because in this case you might not want to break your contract - you just want it back to normal. Do I smell a class action?

Thanks, I will make the changes soon.

Apologies - no intent to deceive. Can you please explain how using a log plot is problematic?

Could you please describe how to disable USB auto run?
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:51:34
Fair enough - I suppose there is a tradeoff between showing price movement across a very large range and keeping a linear scale.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:21:45
I'm not sure I understand - could you please explain this more?

Ok, I see. So the security comes from having different operating systems between your online and offline computers.

I think there might be a problem with the approach described by OP.
When you want to spend your coins, you need to plug a USB stick in the online computer, then the offline computer, then back to the online computer. A virus/malware on the online computer could be transmitted to the offline computer in this manner. Consider this scenario:
1. I infect your online computer with malware.
2. You plug in a USB into the online computer. My malware infects the USB.
3. You plug the USB into the offline computer. My malware finds your btc private key when you use it to make the transaction, and records it.
4. You plug the USB back into the online computer. My malware now has access to the internet, and sends the private key to me.
5. I spend your BTC.
I may be wrong in this, and would be happy to learn where my mistake is or how to plug this hole.

How much bandwidth are you seeing used?
Are you getting close to the 1TB of bandwidth on DigitalOcean's $5/month plan?

How many characters are in one transaction? I like this solution, but am wondering if a transaction is &gt;1,000 characters that I may not notice an error made by the OCR software.

I feel that it would be trusting a little too much in linux to say that there is no malware at all.
