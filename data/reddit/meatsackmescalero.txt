This is a fallacious viewpoint.  Just because gold may get revalued (currencies will be concurrently and simultaneously devalued) does not mean people will be paying $100 for a loaf of bread.  
There is talk of Gold potentially backing the Yuan, Ruble, sovereign trade notes and perhaps even the $US if they can ever prove they have one ounce of unencumbered gold left at West Point if push comes to shove.
Gold cannot back a "global" monetary system or trade notes at the current price but gold will be revalued at some point.  Book it.

If I had more BTC wealth, and wealth in general, I'd do this tomorrow.  A visa-free passport from a gorgeous "jurisdiction" and potentially an income producing asset if not simply a holiday retreat or new home.

Well usrn has a valid point.  
Where in Eastern cultures are there the miriad and types of "unfunded liabilities" like "Social Security" and publicly-funded healthcare, etc.  Systems that are unsustainable and/or underfunded and/or operating in deficit or in the case of "Social Security, fundamentally a Ponzi scheme.  These are promises made by governments that will likely not be kept going forward, the types of promises that are taken for granted by people in the West, people who are all too happy to relinquish any and all responsibility for themselves and their old age/retirement to their governments, associated agencies and departments.  
Why do you think they raised the retirement age in Canada to 67 to be eligible for full old age security benefits starting in 10 years or so?  Why are they currently suggesting people of retirement age opt to delay collecting benefits until they are 70 for a few more bucks, equating to a massive loss of benefits fundamentally, if they live that long. 
Because they know they're broke and these promises to the citizenry in the West who trust them to actually keep them are in serious jeopardy to say the least from here on out. 
How do you think Spain is going to pay for it's public pensions going forward with over 50% real youth unemployment?
Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Ireland, Greece... Even private pensions being raided... and you criticize someone for suggesting that people are delusional to think that in 20 years they're going to be living happily ever after on fat cheques in the mail?
It's been happening for a while now and it will not stop because the system is inherently broken and has been for quite some time. 
The social contract has been broken in the West in many regards and that is where usrn is bang-on in his or her assessment of brainwashed and complacent Western mindsets utterly oblivious to these trends.

I would only feel comfortable spending from small denomination paper wallets, even BIP0038 despite Mycelium only holding the private key in memory.

Mankind has very little to zero to do with NATURAL climate change that's been occurring for billions of years.   It was over two degrees centigrade warmer a thousand years ago when the Norse were farming on Greenland.
In the 70s there was panic that we were heading into another ice age.
There has been no mean atmospheric warming for well over a decade and we may likely be heading into a cooling trend.  Regardless, the proponent "scientists"/politicians/propagandists have proven themselves as charlatans with the infamous "hockey stick" graph erasing the medieval warm period, East Anglia scandal, continually-failed computer modeling outcomes and general douchebaggery.
The "global warming"/"climate change" agenda is anti-human.
It is representative of just how asinine these theories are when they attribute atmospheric warming to an inert gas (co2) that constitutes a miniscule fraction of one percent of our atmosphere, necessary for life on this planet and has virtually zero IR retention properties.  
Even if humans were responsible, how do you think we're going to "fight" it and maintain our standards of living with increasing population and environmental demand?

I use small denomination BIP38 wallets for any spending BTC using Mycelium, change is sent back to the same public address.  Sweep and spend until the wallet is empty.

You don't have to just have a paper copy or copies.  One can keep digital image copies of the paper wallets stored (in encrypted containers if one wants just for a bit of added security) on various and numerous media Lord knows wherever one wants also.  
Why not make multiple wallets with the same password if you don't want too much confusion?
BIP38 is great and with BIP38 compatible wallets you're all good from cold storage to spending.
In my opinion it is safe and convenient, just ensure you take all the security precautions you can (offline generation and creation of wallets on an offline system, etc) and rest easy.
   
Good luck

"Why are people entertaining the idea of continuing to finance the violence of the state when we finally have a technology that allows us to withdraw our consent?"
Because, and sorry to be cliché...
"That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."
These changes take time and some never happen but it is our time to know.  All we can do is to never underestimate one person's ability to change the world.  That includes us chum, good luck to us all.
By the way, I love this wallet but the reuse of addresses needs to be dealt with yesterday.  Interestingly also is when I am in the middle of decrypting a BIP38 private key and I tilt my tablet from portrait to landscape or vise versa, the operation aborts immediately.  No biggy but somewhat annoying.  
I just redistributed my holdings from one BIP38 offline wallet into a dozen other BIP38 offline wallets with my Nexus 7 and Mycelium this weekend without a hitch.  Really impressed.  
Keep-up the tremendous work Mycelium Team!

Exactly some of my concerns.  If I was to sweep a paper wallet once to spend, especially a BIP38 key due to having to decrypt it on the device, I would then consider that private key to be compromised (whether it would be at that point or not) due to Android and devices running it being of questionable security in terms of BTC to say the least.  From what I understand, rooted devices are even much less secure than "locked" devices which should be taken into consideration also.   This is why I'd only do this with small denomination "spending wallets" personally.
Permissions in KitKat are a nightmare for anyone depending on data security and peace of mind with regards to BTC IMHO due to the total lack of user control, totally contingent on whatever a given app "requires" for installation in the first place and whatever all the crap on Android (that one can't adjust permissions for, reliably disable and/or get rid of) wants to access.

Won't say what I do but I'd recommend never keeping more on your device than you're prepared to lose and keep the rest in paper wallets, backed-up on paper and digitally.  If you need to sweep a paper wallet, send your change to a new address/paper wallet generated offline and securely as soon as possible if the wallet doesn't do that already.  I can recommend BIP0038 paper wallets.
If you like to spend your BTC, keep a bunch of small denomination paper wallets so you never have a large sum exposed if you're sweeping/spending them.  I like my little tablet running Android but I don't trust it in the least, nor should you.

That's what I was wondering, whether it was somewhat "advised" or not to migrate one's coin into HD addresses/keys and backups once the new version is released.
When saying "HD account" do you mean any and all addresses/keys generated under any given "seed" or back-up/word strings?
Anyway, as someone who currently has too much coin on and backed-up with my current install of Mycelium, a transition like this makes me a bit uneasy.

Let's see... Create "credit" or "money", units of perceived value, out of thin air and from nothing, lend it out with interest owing to the institution that just performed this feat of magic, paid for in "the debtor's" real labor and production?  What is that?  
That's usury by definition.  You hardly qualify in knowing what you're talking about apparently.
What has RBS been doing in the UK inflicting highly usurious and predatory "lending" practices to bankrupt and seize hundreds of formerly solvent businesses' assets out from under people for pennies on the dollar?
That's fraud and theft as far as quite a lot of people are concerned.  Just one small, isolated example in the grand scheme of things.
Naturally paying $20 for something Bitcoin can do for $0.05 is relevant here somewhere too... 
Banks are a necessary service and utility these days as everything from suburban standards of living to militarily supporting the Petro-dollar empire is addicted to and dependent on credit, spending and debt but you make it sound like the entire industry is humanitarian or something which is disingenuous to say the least.

I'm using Mycelium on a Nexus 7 and it is great.
OP, IMHO, cold storage means offline paper wallets and digital backups thereof.
One of the nice things about Mycelium is the way in which it handles sweeping and spending from paper wallets although I wouldn't use this feature with large denomination paper wallets.

At least you can admit that public pensions in the West are a promise that will likely not be kept for whatever reason.

It's likely not their fault at all as usually banks will hold funds for a period of time.    
However, you would be doing yourself a favor by getting verified (took me less than two hours for Level 3 verification) with VoS and trying them too.  One can fund their account instantly with at least up to $2500 using Interac Bill Payment.

I'm a Bitcoiner, believe me.  However, I love using my credit card to purchase items, especially pricy ones, simply because of what is essentially purchase and product insurance.  If something's broken or defective, if I have trouble with a vendor or don't receive the item, etc., etc.
The vendor bares all the risk and cost of the transaction (unless I'm on the hook for exchange rate conversion which I'm charged dearly for)  and me as the consumer benefits 100% which is one more reason why you'd think vendors would be knocking down the BTC door to incorporate it into their finances...  
CCs may be somewhat insecure but I've never been unhappy using mine.  I've had to dispute charges and get new cards due to identlty theft, etc. too but I've never been left hanging and have always been made whole and/or satisfied with the way my CC company covers me.
I can't say the same for buying with BTC.

I think it has been for a while and perhaps that is coming into the mainstream as infrastructure and utility is "built-out" and positive news continues to proliferate.  I've read a bit about what CoinKite is doing in my area and it looks tremendous.  Businesses need to have some kind of incentive to accept BTC, need to have the hardware reliably and easily integrated into their PoS, Invoice/Payments, etc. and need to have confidence in it.  
With more people hopefully owning and wanting to spend BTC it is inevitable that businesses will do it for a small percentage of their sales if it's made seamless and easy?  I'm not one who thinks BTC is going to replace the dollar or take down governments but I do think 5-10% of global remittances isn't out of the question if it catches on.
With more and more people starting to get interested and use it hopefully this is simply a matter of technological adoption and time is all it will take.
I remember people fumbling with credit cards, payment terminals and ATMs when I was a younger man so people's trouble to interact with the network eventually doesn't concern me. 
Long story short, yes.

I've been thinking the exact same thing for a couple of weeks.
I sold last Spring and Summer for what I thought was a profit (and for what was a nice profit at the time even after cap. gains tax) in a potentially nose-diving market.  It feels the same, amplified multiple fold.    
I've since gotten back in and am hodling a nice position but it came at a significant cost and loss of profit compared to where I'd be had I kept my original holding.
I'm not making the same mistake again and have been accumulating since last October.  To zero or many zeros I go.

Both of these guys sell precious metals for a living, between that and their inflated egos I'd say let them have their self-righteous blathering.  4 years of anything from dead money to outright 65% capital losses over the time frame in precious metals "prices" compared to what Bitcoin has accomplished over that same time and these talking heads are still bashing it?   Sad really... 
I'm not knocking gold and silver in the least, only people like these two who have been telling others to buy the dip in precious metals prices for almost 4 years now.  When one sells precious metals for a living though...

The RMB will eventually be convertible to BTC in places with legal BTC trading, even in a roundabout way, even if it remains outlawed from the RMB system in China longer term.

BrotherJohnF brought-up a very relevant point in his latest Bitcoin video.
He presents the idea that this new Bitcoin ETF is actually the development of an instrument that will undermine Bitcoin by diverting capital into a "paper" holding vehicle rather than having it go directly into the asset itself.  Could it really be an attempt by the twins to lucratively cash-out of their huge position as many have suggested?
As this "strategy" has worked wonderfully with precious metals via GLD, SLV, etc., there could be validity to this train of thought.
Can the BTC community trust the Winkelwhatevers as far as they could throw them in that that the development of instruments like these may not simply be "entrepreneurial endeavours" by individuals?

It may take up to 24 hours in some instances.   I just made a transaction this morning and it took less than 10 minutes for the BTC to reach the address.  
BTC isn't easy to get at any given time necessarily but if you're that fussy and live in the middle of nowhere there aren't many options, all of which have been mentioned now from the looks of it.  I imagine you can get BTC in a few hours through someone on locals with e-mail money transfer or direct bank deposit but expect a higher premium for expedience.
Localbitcoins in Vancouver is pretty well-supplied and if you call the number of Bitcoin Co-op in you can usually meet-up with one of the reps within 24 hours, they are a great bunch.  Maybe a city run is in order?  Or resignation to a weeks-long verification process?
There are pros and cons to all of these methods so be resigned to it.  VoS is a quick exchange to get verified with but there is no liquidity, VirtEx is the best trading environment but it takes weeks to get verified, locals and Q-BT are quick but the premiums are higher, etc., etc.
Good luck!

People weren't taking zero-down half million dollar mortgages on a house they shouldn't have and then borrowing against that "equity" to buy a couple of brand new Escalades when people were panning nuggets out of that stream either.   Gold is how Fiat is priced, not vise versa.  Accounting for debt and money creation is done by gold.  "Price" of gold in itself is almost irrelevant altogether now.
The reason it costs that much is because those are real costs in dollar terms.  I don't know what you mean about being the "most cost effective way to meet demand".  Demand CAN"T be met at $1300/oz and some mines CAN"T be profitable given this "price" for their product.  An ore body's structure dictates what it's going to cost to get an ounce, not price.  Demand should also drive price but not in the controlled holographic confetti markets.  GLD and COMEX/LBMA being sucked for tons of gold every day, ABN Amro and HkMEx defalting, Germany told to wait 7 years for 300 tons, rich people everywhere scattering for gold.   This has just begun.
My point is the world has never gone off a gold standard and we are in the midst of seeing it reassert itself as the world's reserve currency to a degree.  There is not enough gold currently above ground at the current price...  I see the point you're making but hopefully you can see mine as well.  
Gold is still the ultimate monetary statement of account.  I submit it is not so much profitable currently as there is demand for it despite what goes on in the futures markets.   It is NOT profitable for many projects now that the "price" has been screwed with in the triple digits:1 leveraged paper markets which is why demand has been out-stripping supply by a significant margin lately.  
Perception of value and demand for it, maybe with a side of rarity and human psychology, drives price it seems to me.  Hence the whole relationship between how mines operate and are financed, demand for product and most of all how true price is discovered have been so totally distorted artificially to the point of it blowing up.  Demand through the roof, "price" plummeting with supply unable to keep-up, even at a loss for some mines.  Yeah, that makes sense to you?
 
Look at the loss of purchasing power of the $ over just the last decade against gold.  Look at a 50% decline in the DOW since 2007 against gold even after the DOW reached a "new high" and gold got tuned.  Real purchasing power, real value is why supply/demand broke recently and why "price" in dollars on leveraged paper exchanges is a farce and an utter abstraction.

No, the reason gold is not $150 out of the ground is because it takes anywhere from 5 to 10 times that "price" in exploration, drilling, labor, machinery, fuel, refining, transportation, etc...  
We're missing the point?  How many mining execs are going to execute on a mine with a $1500 cost of production if spot is under $1400?  
This whole "imputed value" malarckey is not only BS from a production standpoint but in assessment of the true value of an ounce of gold.  
Problem is there is no real price discovery anymore thanks to all the essentially free money from a Fed Reserve counterfeiter used by bullion banks and large specs to naked short the crap out of the metal in fraudulent, manipulated and highly leveraged paper markets to not only cash settle contracts and covertly acquire physical but maintain the greatest paper Ponzi Scheme in human history for a little longer.
  
Nobody knows what an ounce of gold is really worth anymore denominated in $US toilet paper or any other Fiat currency for that matter but simply given current real inflation, real debt and money supply it is certainly multiples of its current "price".  
This concept of "imputed value" is much more appropriately applied to, hmmm let's see, the "value" of a certain covert data mining operation and self-inflicted forfeiture of one's privacy called Facebook that has zero imputed value as far as I and many others are concerned yet is valued in the billions by the Ponzi, it's "financing" by suckers and it's subjects.  I guess that's why this guy just looks like an idiot when talking about real money and real value.

Yeah, bad call on my part although the crosses show much more divergence... I guess the real question is why does volatility in Bitcoin even matter with companies like BitPay around or ways to easily scale prices with exchange rates, etc?

I'm officially shopping for a new exchange after what happened with VitrEx last night but despite all the good words about VoS, there is no liquidity compared to VirtEx.  That is why so many people still need to use VirtEx if they are trading any quantity whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:41:38
Too bad there's no volume, I'd love to use a different exchange...

For a paradise they are sure flogging it hard on the internet and always seem to come-up with presale lots at a discount after presales end... 
Do not forget people, this thing is someone's business and they're not doing it because they want you to live in paradise.  Check it out but one needs to see the nondisclosure agreement, etc. and do some serious DD before even thinking about this.

I just did this very thing for the first time today and it was easy with Mycelium on my Nexus 7.  It's a very nice client and fairly easy to use for a dummy like me.  *The* Android BTC client I'd imagine?  Android is a great OS aside from almost everything having access to everything (lack of permissions control) on one's device, I'm enjoying it.  
Merry Christmas and good stuff in the year ahead to Reddit.

It doesn't show if they've sent it but it does show it as withdrawn from my account (BTC Balance) to that public key address.  It no longer exists with them as far as their site and my account is concerned.  The address I gave them and the one that shows in my transaction history on their site is the same one in my client.  Still nothing showing for that address in blockchain.info aside from 2 old transactions either.  I am scared, it's a lot to be lost so far.

They DO NOT do this.  I just logged in and looked at my transaction history and the fees for any given trade are credited back to one's account after a cancellation and upon the funds exiting escrow.  They would never be able to get away with that.

Your "points" are too cryptic, seemingly ignore many current "market dynamics" and make very little real world sense in general, sorry.
There is not enough gold just sitting around to satisfy demand from industry and "investors" at the current price, on the contrary.  You seem to be treating the value of and demand for gold as being derived solely from being an industrial commodity alone which couldn't be further from the truth.

From the last couple of times I've done it on a non-SSD MacBook Pro, I wouldn't think 2-4 days out of the question at this point depending on one's system and connection.  My new MBPrd with an SSD synchs noticeably much faster.  I'm on pretty fast fibre optic and never get more than 10 connections.  It's frustrating the first time you run it but once it's done and with fairly regular synching it has been a nice solid platform for me as I just buy and put into cold storage.

Dead simple for small amounts up to .08 BTC with one's debit card within a 24 hour period.

Not sure what he means by production value but it currently costs between roughly $750 - $1400 depending on the miner just to get the stuff out of the ground and I think he's abstracting "value" disingenuously to make some kind of point.  The rest is impuned value?  This guy obviously has no concept of the history of money, current "market dynamics" and "management of perception" utterly distorting "value", or gold itself it would seem.  
Bitcoin is a huge deal but if a guy like this is going to butcher his own analogy perhaps it's worth taking him with at least a shovel full of salt?  If I misinterpreted please correct me but I've seen better pitches at a car dealership.

Just spoke to one of the lads.  Although this is a fantastic idea to facilitate easy purchase of BTC and I wish these guys all success, the premium isn't easy to stomach.  Very ballsy business venture for sure.  
Best of luck Tinkercoin!

Good points also and let's face it... If "they" want to confiscate assets, "they" can come after gold and silver much easier than Bitcoin.  Whether in a private vault or not, the locations are obvious and well-known globally.  Security at a private vault and an allocated or segregated gold holding means nothing if the full force and effect of any "government" comes into play.
A lot of these Austrian Economists are too busy tripping over their Von Mises fetish to think flexibly and with an open mind, asserting that one day we'll be walking around transacting and paying for goods and services in pieces of silver and gold.  I think precious metals will certainly be more a part of the financial and monetary system(s) going forward but I just laugh at these guys now with some of the assertions and ignorant statements they make.  Even one of the hyperbolic KWN pump-tards James Turk, who's been 100% wrong in babbling about gold going through the roof any second now for a couple of years, while holders of GoldMoney acounts get absolutely tuned, has started to recognize the virtues in Bitcoin.  Alastair is a dinosaur and well behind the curve.

From all the bad news about BitInstant around could this not forebode the perfect kiss of death for this "Bitcoin WinkelFund"?

It's not really hard but it is tedious and requires attention.
I'm pretty much an idiot and I was able to figure-out my own plan from backing-up my wallet.dat file into encrypted volumes on 4 types of media in varying safe locations, paper wallets ditto, meticulous record-keeping...
I took one look at Ubuntu boot thumb drives, tried it under 2 different versions of OS X with no real success and devised a safe plan that works for me. 
Don't get too caught-up in the ultra-tech methods which work well for the very computer-savvy, it doesn't have to be that hard if computers aren't your forte.
Good luck!

Wow, what a great little buying opportunity that was, on VirtEx anyway...  Naturally no money on the exchange but good for those that did.

I did it on another system and it made no difference whatsoever for me.

I'd love to try this but is it rock solid on OS X 10.9?

Show them charts of most Western currencies over the last couple of months compared to BTC and then ask them how volatile it is?  It's only hard to account for if one doesn't want to do it.
