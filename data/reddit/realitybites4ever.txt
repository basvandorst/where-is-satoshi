Are you high or something? The guy has lost his 3 month old job without getting paid for 1 month and do you really think with your horseshit for brains that this guy's tenure in a fraudulent company will look good on his CV?
He's got every right to piss all over Brewster and you should try and respect his plight by sticking your head up your arse and shut the fuck up!

Lol dude you're really one big baby who should get a licence to use the internet.
Brewster has swindled, robbed, conned, defrauded/.../ you. Your insistence believing that he didn't and this has something to do with a shit poor Romanian sob who's probably NOT here, is conducive of nutjob fruitbasket case.
If ppl have told you more than once that you suffer from the aforementioned condition that's one indication that something is cooky w you.

Well other blokes did a due dilligence report on Neo and Bee and they did spot the glaring gaps!
So for all purposes intended Tuur your skills as an economist have failed you and have failed audiences that thought Brewster had something good going given the high praise you shamelessly gave him!
Live in guiilt!

Danny if indeed you are Danny,
Your former COO George Papageorgiou says you also duped him and he is trying to clean out your mess.
You did defraud everyone as it is obvious from the economic analysis this guy did.
Cypriot authorities should ask for a europol warrant against you! You have a lot of explaining to do and none of this claptrap will fly!
