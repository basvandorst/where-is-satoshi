I mean the entire point of Bitcoin circumvents traditional banking,
its like the postal service is looking to integrate e-mail as a way for different offices to communicate more effectively yet also being in complete denial to the fact that their customers may also use e-mail but to communicate among themselves rather than use the postal service.

best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is today. keep in mind that bitcoin is still at its infancy and although 600 or 700 may seem like alot of money for now bitcoin has only been around for 7 years, if u buy now u will still be considered an early adopter. 
As for price, in the longterm bitcoin will either drop to 0 or have many 0s. 3 or 4 years ago, buying bitcoin would have carried much more risk; an example being mt.gox being the only major exchange. Today, the ecosystem is much larger and crypto/" blockchain" is being taken much more seriously.

@_date: 2018-06-27 02:23:38
That means you'll either cash out before the true bitcoin ATH since you don't actually believe in adoption. Or you might sell at a loss because again you don't believe in adoption.  Bitcoin is financial freedom disguised as a get rich quick scheme; you need to look at the big picture and realize it really has the potential the change the world. 
We have the ability to send money instantly (lightning network) and semi-anonymously without ANYONE being able to stop us. Also, this money is programmable and we can store it in literally ANY medium, even with just our minds! Do you think society is collectively going to say nah and pass up on something like this? Do you really think this might be just a fad? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:26:25
more like the ONLY real exchange, gox had a stupid monopoly on bitcoin at the time. We've learned our lesson and now we even have decentralized exchanges, there is no reason for the price to trade sideways for so long.

however if i choose to keep my bitcoins in cold storage then their value will be retained as long as i don't spend them during a hard fork, is this correct?

where am i wrong? i don't mean it in an offensive way, just genuinely want to expand my understanding of money/bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:39:59
thank you, precisely the answer i was looking for!
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:18:09
under what scenario would my coins be "unusable", my understanding is that coins transferred to the "fork" which ultimately fails will be worthless, how much truth is in that?
@_date: 2015-07-28 11:30:32
its best to use an offline paper wallet to store the bulk of your bitcoins while having a day-to-day spending amount on any platform which offers 2 factor security. Also, don't use brain wallets for your paper wallets as they are known to be weaker to brute force attacks.

@_date: 2016-07-04 23:38:45
thing is, in order to understand why bitcoin is a better alternative than our current monetary system; u need to first learn about the history of money, inflation, how centralized banking works, etc. It takes u all the way down the rabbit hole.

Only part worth mentioning imo is the back and forth between Bobby lee of BTCChina and the "Professor"/guy in the white jacket. 
the "Professor" is a self proclaimed bitcoin guru who began taking bitcoin seriously around 2013. He believes that bitcoin is essentially a ponzi scheme created by a group of very high IQ people who are collectively known as Satoshi nakamoto. He goes out the point out the Mt.gox bubble and says that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and could "pop" at anytime like all bubbles do.
At around 25 mins the "Professor" makes a point about real estate vs bitcoin. He states that real estate has real intrinsic value because I can utilize the land whereas bitcoin is only code on a computer screen. Bobby lee says, "if i own property in Guangzhuo and I live in shanghai, then in terms of real value, my property in Guangzhuo is worthless since I cannot utilize the land, yet it is still valuable because there is a market for it. The price of something is not what I decide it is but rather what someone else is willing to pay for it". Bobby then points out the market price of 5000 yuan/btc and asks the "Professor" that if someone should offer 100 btc to him for free, worth roughly the same amount as a house in Guangzhuo if he would accept the donation to which he replies no. LOL?
The "Professor" then goes on and says that bitcoin indeed has a price yet no real value. Bobby says that price itself is indicative of value, how can something have a price yet have no value. The professor then compares bitcoin to gold and states that gold has real value while bitcoin does not and then personally attacks Bobby lee by asking him if he donated bitcoin to some earthquake charity in 2013 with bitcoins to which Bobby lee replies yes. The "Professor" then accuses Bobby of using the event as a platform to "pump" bitcoin so that he can manipulate a worthless currency into something of value so his own share would be worth more.
Bobby goes back to his point of how something can have no value yet have a high market price. The "Professor" replies with " it is because of people like you who manipulate the currency", and asks Bobby how bitcoin has value. Bobby replies " bitcoin is the world's first truly decentralized currency with no center ". The "Professor" says Bobby's claim is bullshit and that a system like bitcoin has existed since the 1990s and compares bitcoin to e-gold. Bobby lee asks the "Professor" to give an example of one such decentralized system to which the "Professor" responds, " there are many, no shit, you aren't a cryptographer what would you know I don't want to argue with you anymore you are not making sense." 
TLDR: Dude in the white jacket is on some chinese tv show about bitcoin and no has clue what hes talking about.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:24:36
be careful of the Trezor shills, no matter how secure it may seem you are still trusting your bitcoins with a third party. I keep mine locked away in cold storage; sometimes the simplest solution is the best.
