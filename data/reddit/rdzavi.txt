There is no way in hell someone would sell their BitCoins for &lt;700$. ETF non approval is bad in terms that there will be no new fresh money in system, not like there is some flaw or problem with BitCoin. It is just that regulators are not ready to give it one more freedom... yet.

Cost of drive will skyrocket because AI would be safer therefore we will put much higher price on insurance for people that still want to drive. Also many drive related business operates on big number economy, as we drastically lower number of drivers/cars/rucks on the road prices would have to go up.
Basically, imo, only enthusiasts' will keep driving cars when AI comes around.

Bitcoin is far far away from mass adoption. It will take at least 5-10 years of development and spreading until we even knock on that door. At that point btc will be technically mature and there will be supporting infrastructure. Aldo volatility will be reduced since market cap will be much larger then today.
Problem with competing crypto that gov or UN will create is centralised part. Who controls it? USA? Russia? China? If it is not global and borderless and decentralize then it is not real contender to BitCoin, it is just digital FIAT with all it's flaws, and that don't have real value.

So what if couple of weeks transactions takes 40 minutes, if after that you'll get Lightning Network, and god knows what else. That is small price to pay. 
BU will crush sooner or latter with it's buggy code, and what then?
But you are right. Users don't care about who is 'tehnically superior', they care which one is called "BTC", and which is used by whole community (friends, exchanges, wallets). They don't care which one miners wants to call 'bitcoin'. :)
However, market cares A LOT about decentralization. No one wants to buy apolitical, borderless, permisionless money that is controlled by couple of guys back in China.

There is no way miners will fork and risk a PoW change. That would mean that they are gambling with all their investment on BU (BTU) since they couldn't return to min Core (BTC) chain if/when BU fails.
Also, even if BU doesn't fail miserably, in best case they would mine BTU which would worth lets say half of what is BTC now. That alone would put them under water. 
They are not stupid, they know that BU FH will not get them far and that BU exist only to bluff and to block SegWit.

I think biggest problem I faced with 'converting' people to BitCoin is that they have to admit to them self that they have been fooled and robbed up until this point in life. And people have to big of an ego to do that.
Second problem is that people don't understand personal finance good enough. They just go with the flow and play the game of expected life as well ad they can. I think that something like "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is prerequisite for this people so they can fully appreciate and understand what BitCoin is.

Ok, this might be shocking to you. People of Congo pay taxes as well. Afghanistan is destroyed with USA tax money so that is bad example.
But your basic premise is wrong - This guy should pay USA 600,000$ for allowing him to buy CPU, GPU or ASICs?
Are you aware that USA is nothing special in this regards, there are bitcoin millionaires all around the globe. USA is just very efficient in tax collecting, that is all. And by efficient I mean they will quickly send man with guns to put you in cage if you don't pay your share that they think it is fair.

I was thinking about that. :)
Guy on localbitcoins that sales him BTC have to buy/mine it in the first place. Basically, guy is only earning the trading spread or mining margin and rest of money goes elsewhere. Probably all the way to miners and electric companies and resources that are destroy for electricity creation.
However, if there is a large need for bitcoins in one country in short period of time, BTC price will go up in domestic currency (like in Venezuela or India) which is not good for our 'rebels' since they probably won't do this if they lose money in the process. But, this process on the other hand might take domestic currency down if volume is high enough...
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:26:30
Well, different parts of community will want different things. 
Implementing some of those things is not "giving control" to anyone, it is just trying to make bitcoin as useful to as many people possible.

Also, if they want to force us to use banks for basic needs (like buying food), then service should be totally free of charge. No account maintenance, CC anual fee, transaction fee, no nothing.
I belive they know as well that this is wrong and that majority of people don't want this so I'm wondering why they are pushing it? Is there a crush due so they want to trap us in the system when it breaks? Is it a control? Is it that they don't want to have any base money in system? Is it really because of the taxes?

I agree that way how NYA was introduced was not best, but if it there was not of it, maybe we would still be stuck without Segwit. UASF is 20 times riskier then S2X and it would be really bad for Bitcoin brand...

But then again they didn't ban it. It would be easier to ban it now instead when btc grown more. Trying to tax it and don't be passive is different thing.

Biggest problem I see with this kind of policy is because if you ban bitcoin (or make it hard to get), citizens in your country will not buy it (talking about mainstream adoption). That will put citizens of that country in massive disadvantage over citizens of countries that are buying bitcoin while coins are still relatively cheap. I just assumed that bitcoin will grow massively in next  5-10 years.
Sure, bitcoin may never be as big as I just assumed, but are they willing to bet own country future on that judgment?
It is much, much safer to let citizens buying it and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:20:56
Bitcoin will probably go dark at some point (no trace of transactions). But even in current form it can be used anonymously if you want. I mean it was used to buy drugs and many other illegal stuff.
Fiat is bad because it is based on debt and because people who own FIAT printing press steal all your money.
Sure, if something better comes then BTC, we all will gladly use it. It is about the choice to use best currency you like. Not the one that is forced to you by birth in certain border lines. :)
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:23:08
I've considered this but the problem is I believe that BTC will grow and if it grows barrowers will not be able to return loans since loans will increase relative to fiat. Even borrowers with honest goal to return loan would go under if BTC &amp; Loan goes up 30% in single Q.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:56:37

When there is need, there is will to learn and adopt. :)
You can use cash from some country that still prints it. That would actually be good business for that country, when I think about it. :D
But in all seriousness, I think that there will be strong resistance to this law. I know I'll vote for whichever political party is against it!
In my country taxes on income are high (like 50-60%) and social and medical insurance is laughable so whole country takes on paper just friction of wage and rest 'on hands'. There is just no way people in my country will agree to this. That said, my country is not in EU, but they talk here from time to time as well about banning cash.

Loan based economy is what gotten us in this mess. Also, today there is emerging peer-to-peer loans think - Lendingclub, so banks are not essential for that. Most usable thing banks do is - save our money from theft.
Why in the world would you need credit card when you have bitcoin and Abra (assuming they go mainstream)?
Yeah some states will try to stop it I guess... But then again, you can't really stop bitcoin revolution. And even if some state manages to do that somehow, it will end up far worse in the long run when they finally decide to buy BTCs and everybody else got them on way cheeper price.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:14:28
Governments that will make bitcoin hard to use for its citizen will fall behind in future world economy. Consider that whoever fill their pockets with bitcoin in early stages will benefit from it greatly in the long run as bitcoin price will only rise if adoption continues. Squizing couple of $ now in taxes are nothing compared to what they will lose in the long run. Sure, there are some leaders that will only try to fill their pockets during the time they are on the top of state, and those are same states will suffer greatly in the long run.
That is why you don't want to make bitcoin illegal as default option. And as you can see no serious country is making it really illegal, atm. Most are just standing at sides and watch how this will unfold.

Thanks. Can't find this published on English and Google Translate is a bit messy but I get the point.
I think that AirBnB has an agreement with many cities all over the world and pays taxes directly (before money get in hosts hands). It is one thing for government to want to collect taxes and it is other to heavily regulate this area. Often with unreasonable requests and all orchestrated by Hotel lobby.
Imho, it is a big mistake to try to ban (or discourage) AirBnB since it will reduce government tourists money income. Maybe you will squeeze 5-10% more of tourists that come in but I'm sure that in the long run this would be counter productive since less tourists will come. I only travel with AirBnB and choose only to go to places that are AirBnB friendly. I'm sure that there is many, many more people like me. I don't think I will ever put my leg in hotel ever again.

TL;DR Because they are evil, greedy and thinking short term. 
Indians never got banked as other countries did, now with crypto, it is obvious choice since there is no legacy banking system that Indians got used to. Indians would gladly jump into Bitcoin and leap jump over banking system. Similar as Africans never installed telephoned lines and jump straight into mobile phone systems. If gov don't do something to slow it down crypto would absolutely explode there.
Funniest part for me is how are they going to convince people that Crypto is bad "because of money laundry" and there are countries like Japan, China, South Korea that are totally embracing cryptos? :D

That is my question - what harm? 
What do you mean when you say - "Network is not ready"?
I mean, Bitcoin Cash has 8MB on chain blocks and sky didn't fall on them (at least not from that reason). We are scared of 2MB on chain scaling like it will be end of the world...
Btw, I respect the hell out of you and want to say - Thanks for doing awesome job making Bitcoin as great as it is.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:21:41

Removing cash was their plan for last couple of decades now, however because of the rise of bitcoin they have to rush for radical solutions instead of slow, step by step change.

If they rush - there is a big chance that system will backfire.
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:51:31
Getting into BitCoin is a great start. If enough people chooses so and opt-out from the system they will have to change system to be such that people WANT to be part of it.
For examle, AirBnB and Uber enpower people to do fast and safe transaction without any goverment interfere. There for I belive goverment shouln't collect any tax from that transaction if either party hasn't invite them in. Also I belive that more and more such use cases with escrow and smart contracts will emerge where we will not need goverment to 'help' us do the trade and therefor don't pay them anything. I mean, what are you paying? You can't by force tax things where there is a free way which is better. :)

My highly unpopular thought on terrorists:
I don't know about Indians, but many terrorists here in the west are... complicated. NATO/USA goes into some country, throws bunch of bombs, rapes women, steal natural resources, kills democratically elected president etc. And in the event when people of those countries fight back, then that is "terrorism". I mean, to me that sounds like a war which you have bring to your doorsteps by being aggressor.
I'm not saying this to defend terrorists, I'm just saying that word "terrorists" has become a "boogeyman" word that governments throw around whenever they want to justify their controversial actions or pass some law that is clearly against citizens best interest like this one with Bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:16:32
I see many people here says that they can do this faster, cheaper and more elegant with bank, post office, PayPal... I don't buy that argument.
- you can get bitcoin in many ways that don't make you fill any forms, KYC, or anything
- you can sell, spend, stash btc directly without ever converting it to fiat
- you can covert it to fiat and actually make money (like in India or Venecuela where BTC is sold with premium)
- banks charge you monthly account maintenance, selling you other services, re-landing your money with fractional reserve skim... Many ways yo make money of you. Just look how wealthy they are.
- I agree that there is some learning curve to use bitcoin, but a friend can get you up and running in metter of minutes (compare that with situation where you don't have neither bank or btc account)
- sending money between 2 persons via bans is not instant (at least in my country), if you miss "clearing" receiver might wait for tomorrow morning to get its money
- sending money over border to other person is way more complicated and expensive

Ah the good old: "Who would build the roads" argument...
So, your mother and father put a guy in charge of building roads. They gave him salary for that job and they give him a money for workers and material. Then "the guy" steal about 30-70% of money (depending of country) and build the damn road with rest. Further you and everyone else pays for those same roads every year with car registration tax. 
And now you should be grateful for this to government?! How about no? Only folks you need to thanks are your mother and father.
How about they ASK me for what I want my tax money to be spend and offer me projects to choose from. We have technology for a long time for this.
Also I want to see EVERY DIME of tax money where it is spent. Dafuq is this shit: 
I believe that taxation should exist but be much, much, much lower. If most profitable job in whole country is being in charge of managing our money, we are not doing it right by a long shot.
And percentage taxation is stupid AF. Like why would this guy pay 600.000$ more for the roads then the next guy? Percentage taxation is invented only to sell democracy to masses. Poorer people think that is OK if they pay their share as long as rich pay same percentage of much bigger amount of money. But in reality rich people don't pay taxes... They are not stupid. Just ask Lionel Messy.
Hmm, btw, didn't the president of USA said basically "Not paying taxes makes me smart" ?

Well, you don't want to spend currency that grows yearly 100%+ easily and you pay 5%+ fer to get it. So you will pay more in fees currently and miss out on further growth. There will be good time to use it when it gets stable with 5-10% growth and many more stores taking it directly. Currently most of bitcoin users are folks that earn in BTC.

15% of 4M is 600.000$. That is like saving 12 years of average anual salary in USA without spending single penny on anything else.
I think it is well worth moving to a country without capital gains for 600.000$...
Especially given the fact that USA literally did NOTHING in order to help you mine that BTC.

I get your point and not saying that you are wrong. But consider what would you rather possess - 30 BTC or 2400$/month income producing property? Especially in times when there is big correction expected in all traditional markets.
Also big thing to consider is that if you are selling in BTC people can't buy your propertie with debt (not sure IF bank would loan buyer money to buy bitcoins to buy properties).
However I do expect this trend of pricing real estates  in BTC to continue which will reduce real estate prices (since only real money will be accepted, not bank issued confetti FIAT currency)...

Interesting how you are referencing Cuba &amp; Syria, two countries that are destroyed by USA and when I say USA i mean - it's tax payers...
There are many, many, many safe and beautiful countries in the world where your computer can just sit in a room and work... In fact, that is possible even during war and/or sanctions, look at Venezuela (another country that is damaged by USAs tax payers) or Russia which mine bitcoins in this hard times.
Maybe you are influenced too much by mainstream media in USA that always portraits some kind of a great danger and telling you that you need them to protect you. Last month it was Russians, now North Korea, before that Syria, Iraq... Similar as when you go to a private doctor he will try to sell you fear of illness so you buy his services. No difference with government. They are just selling you their services by spreading fear...

Bitcoin can and will scale enough to handle needed number of transactions for global finance. In next couple of weeks/months LN will become thing... who knows what future holds, but I have no doubt about scaling capacity.
I'll for sure gradually abandon traditional finance system. Safekeeping is only thing I could possibly need and that is not really 'financial service'. And about credit, it will still exists even in bitcoin economy, it would just be a bit different then today. Lender would really have to have money he is landing. Crazy concept I know... :)

Agree, but I'm not talking only about buying as an investment. I'm also talking about buyers who will live inside real estate.
Yes, but several years goes buy quickly in real estate. Imagine if you buy something today with loan with interest on 30 years, and then BitCoin takes off and your investment/home is now worth 50% of the price you paid. And you still have big credit to pay off...

Crush is unavoidable, maybe they will choose when will actually happen and respond to it to gain maximum benefits from it. Crashes are times when large capital changes hands.

When there is will and money there is a way. :)
You can get married for papers, open a company, invest (buy real estate)... 
Probably best idea is to do some research online, ask around and talk with trusted lawyer... Then travel to a countries that are potential candidates, see if you really like there and talk to a local lawyer in that country what is best way to do it. 
Again, when you have money, countries tends to let you be their citizens. Why wouldn't they? OP will inject 4M+ in their economy, every country like that.

We are still in "inventor stage", not even "early adopters".
1 in 1000 or 5000 people own bitcoin and would like to do some commerce in it.
With that small numbers you can't really is it for much except on the internet. Just give it time... Both adoption and ease of use will increase. It is all good.
For example I'm thinking to start receiving my salary soon with bitcoin. I guess somewhere after price stabilized around 5000-6000$. Can easily imagine that many people are in similar position and thinking about same.

Regulations can only affect pace of adoption in that country. But bigger problem for them is if citizens don't buy it. Imagine this like a digital gold which everyone can go into digital world and take it. However your country don't let you go get the gold and because of their stupid laws you will have to buy the gold from us who took it now for much higher price. That government and their citizens would be left behind in new world order. This is the reason why no country banning crypto. They are just trying to get taxes and control pace in the process.

Doubling of usage in 3 months? Actually, since now segwit it enabled this 2X would get us to 4-8MB increase, meaning that in 3 months it would be 4-8 times more transactions? I hope you are right, but most probably you are not. :)

and converting it in time of trade into Yen with something like BitPay...
Also, it says "regulation prohibits financial firms like banks from doing the same" doesn't say anything about general type of business. I'm not sure to what degree it is legal in China, but it is certain that it is not criminalized or ban, far from it. Indians talking about banning it altogether, which is different animal.

1) I did address, you just fail to understand what I wanted to say. AirBnB is new model of doing business. Obviously there is market for it and hosts and guests that are using it are quite happy with it. Sure, housing market is affected, hotel business is affected, probably house maid business and who knows what else. Things changed... We can't forbid someone to do with its property what he wants, can't we? In internet based presence, two non-known parties can mach and have great experience. That is base of Uber, AirBnB and whole sharing economy. It is OK if you don't like sharing economy, just don't try to stop it because it affects some other thing that you like.
2) Well, we, hosts take most oh the risk of business model, aren't we? We are the ones that are dealing with strangers. But AirBnB doing their part of supporting and doing its best to get rid of bad guests.
There is like 2.000.000 bookings on AirBnB, one bad host is just a drop in a ocean. Also, AirBnB ban hosts and guests all the time. That is the beauty of it. If you are cool guy you will have cheep trips and meet great new people. If you are jerk - go pay hotel 30% more money. Your call. :)

They don't want to do it. Imagine if they did ban it when BTC was say 1000$... Sure, it would take for little longer for BTC to get to 3000; BitCoin startups would open new jobs somewhere else; in USA black market would form, meaning no tax money; and most important of all - all Americans that wasn't able to easily buy it at 1000 would have to pay 5000-10.000-50.000 per bitcoin once USA un-ban it. That would hurt weak USA economy pretty bad.
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:31:48
But, you can still buy other thing that stores value - Gold, silver, art, collection figures, old cars, bitcoin, cash from some other country, real estate... Further more if there is need we can trade directly with those things. Criminals will for sure do this.

Yap, and ability to create money out of thin air, money that is not backed by anything. And that is the single most important reason why millions of people in middle class are struggling and on the other hand why banks and bank related business gotten enormously rich in last couple of decades.


True, they still do, but I'm talking about the future, and considering is there a better way to do things. If you deposit money in bank and get 0.5%-1% return and bank then loans that same money to someone else for 3-5-10-20% interest it seams that there is a room for a better deal for lender and borrower, isn't it?


It seams that you fail to understand that banks don't have it's own money. It has OUR money which we deposited and money they create out of thin air to do business with. With BitCoin and Abra and peer-to-peer landing people will still be able to get loans but with much more fair terms. Go today to peer-to-peer and bank site, get a loan quote and you will see what I'm talking about.

All CC transactions has fee of 2-2.5% attached and lion share of that fee goes to theft protection. However that fee is charged to business that receives your money (let's say local baker). Then your baker since everybody is paying with CC must raise price in order to cover that additional transaction cost that wouldn't exist if everyone would deal with cash.

Thanks, I'm aware of how much segwit, as it gets used, will increase on chain capacity. 
What is the problem of having blocks increase 2Mb which will increase total transactions output to somewhere between 2-8MB in total if it will not significantly impact centralization of mining or node count?
Well, we will have to deal with a fork to 2X if we choose to ignore NYA. If we all agree to do it would be non-event. 
So I'm just wondering why are we choosing the drama path? :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:23:56
Well, with Segwit2X we will increase current blocks by 4-8mb. That will not fill that quickly, especially given the fact that off chain will kick in at some point.

Sure, online there is need for some protection since there is no person in front of you that is handing you cash however, escrow, smart contracts or even positive reviews are better protection then KYC.
When you think about it: You as a service/product provider, don't really care about the person identity, you care that transaction go smoothly. And tech should develop that way - making transactions safe and reliable as BTC is aiming to do.
Government is the one that is trying to attach a name to a transaction mostly for taxation purposes...

It happened in many other countries (including my own) and it could happen to yours tomorrow but you wouldn't be able to protect your self since you gave them to much power.

My country has gone through hyper inflation back in the 90s. 
That means that one day government has decided to steal all your money. You know in a way "us against them". People were going into banks to get theirs money out of the system but banks wouldn't give it to them. People after that went with the bombs in bank to force them to give them all their money. Also, your only solution was to change your bad money in good money (gold, euro, usd) but you had to have cash for that.
No one couldn't see that comming. We were good stable country with solid economy... It happened over night.
Now imagine that in your world where cash is dead and banks are kings your government decides to do the similar thing
@_date: 2016-12-28 13:37:47
hmm... I think that we are brain wash since emergency of CC. For thousands of years people were paying in cash with hardly any KYC in place and world hasn't stumble in flames. Now with CC KYC is like mandatory in order to you know... fight with pedophiles and terrorists. I don't buy that argument and I don't think KYC is nearly as important as they want it to present it. They just need it because of tax evasion controls.
So if they call you "Walter White" for not using fiat money... I choose to fight/evade that law as much as I can.

Maybe in terms of controling money flow, but you as a host don't really care who and how paid for the place. It is possible to pay with CC that is not on your name. Also it is possible for a company to pay for employee. However, there is "Verify your ID" feature that is based on ID or Passport and is shown on profile page. Me personally insist that all my guest verify their ID, I don't see why would I care which payment method have they used...

Well I'm assuming that you are earning more then you spend (as you should). In the long run you'll be better off with currency that gains value over time.


Not sure about this one... 
Your point about you having to secure your coins yourself is valid. I'd definitely list that as one of the cons of Bitcoins. But I still find much more upside to it so I'm willing to take my chances.
By the way. When you say "you can get your money back" in case that someone robs a bank. That is a service that you pay. With bitcoin you don't spend money for protection / insurance. That's why it is cheaper but more dangerous to store your bitcoin.

First of all, they don't have to convert it back to fiat. Some will do, some will not. If they like to keep their wealth in USD, EUR, Gold, BTC, ETC, Moner... Why would I care?
Second and more importantly. By using bitcoin you are enjoying have all it's good qualities that FIAT/MasterCard don't have: Permissionless, Borderless, Anonymus and ofc - you don't lose you money because of inflation and government confiscation...
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:39:02
I was referring to the fact that they are pushing cash transactions. In my country CC fee is already included in price so only handful of people realize that prices are blown for additional 3% that goes to banks for processing. Most of my fellow citizens thinks that CC transactions are free.

That only means that there is a 3 party that uses your money for investing and making capital and give you cut. Nothing really special about that that banks does.


It is not difficult with bitcoin. Bitcoin is not debt based currency, meaning that bitcoin is not created with debt. Banks don't lend you real money that they have. From money they gave you, 30% is money from other savers and 60% is money they just invented from thin air. Since in bitcoin world you can't just print more money interests on landing will have to be much-much lower then today. People did landing with gold for thousand of years without problems...
And this is what banks and government fear the most, that people will stop using their debt based, I-can-print-as-much-as-I-want money.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:37:10
Bitcoin is more then 'just a commodity'.
Bitcoin have many different qualities then gold so I'm not going to compare it.
I see bitcoin as a new asset class with it's very unique properties and don't try to fit it into old system.
I don't say that bitcoin will be here in 50 years. But IMO it has by far best chances from all cryptos... Mostly for the network effect, best development team and most robust security...
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:27:30
In most small shops/restaurants in Thailand if you want to pay with CC they will charge you additional 3% on bill size. Other shops will not accept CC if transaction is smaller then 15$.

I honestly think that country adoption would be similar as user adoption. Whichever country gets into bitcoins earlier they will become more rich. 
And if bitcoin continues to grow and gain popularity this will have to happen sooner or latter.

They certainly spend money on protection. Guards, alarms, armored busses, metal trezors, cyber security etc.
And about insurance, why would you say that they don't spend fee money on insurance? Do you think that they just go lose money and tax payers will just keep pouring money back in?
I don't know this for a fact, but I'm sure that private banks have to pay if they want to insure their money. 2008/2009 bailout was precedent, up until last moment, no one wasn't sure that they are even going to do it or let banks down the water.
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:47:22
Good reply, thanks.
Yeah I know about fraud called 'fractional reserves'. :(
I'm with you 100% on that. By the way, do you know that as you repay your lawn to the bank they 'destroy' the money they have created in the first place and keep only the interest as a profit?
However I think they still needs fee money on top of 'fractional reserves' scam. Why not if they can get away with it?
Bitcoin is needed because current rotten system is based on everyone using banks and banks and government extract money from citizens that way. They are, basically, parasites onto society. They purposely made not following that system hard for us, but in the long run if you want do distribute wealth fair among people and not watch how it goes into banksters and politicians pockets we must fight this system. Bitcoin gives power back to the people.
I don't think that bitcoin will easily shut down banks but I think it will force them to behave much more fail since people will always have an alternative if .gov becomes to greedy. Maybe you are coming from good country so you don't understand urgency for currency alternative. :)

It is not like we have to follow one developer until end of time. Core can make x2 implementation as well if they prefer, I bet that would be more popular then btc1 and I'm actually hoping that they do.
If (and that is big "if") majority of NYA signers opt out then I guess we shouldn't do X2, otherwise we should.
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:37:03
Well it definitely is not what OP said: "miners and few business chose different developers".
Core is threading to leave if they don't have absolute control over protocol. Is that something we really want? Large part of community wants small compromise, what is the big deal to make them happy? 
Btw. I'm all pro Core and think they are doing great job but this is just wrong. Also too many people are FUD-ing around r/bitcoin about 2X without any real arguments. 2X will happen sooner or latter and that is a fact. What if it is true that Amazon wants to get in? What if they choose not to because there is only 1Mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:58:25
Yeah, but it is much easier to come up with explanation for 20% of the money VS 100% of the money. Or even pay taxes on only 20% and rest spend tax free...
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:08:06
Not sure if inflation is that big of a incentive actually. It is only 1-2-3% now days and people still spend like crazy. People spend money because they like good things/experiences that makes them happy now.
Bitcoin now have crazy returns but so we don't like to spend it but if ever bitcoin become big and stable we will have deflation of 1-2-3% which will not be significant factor in money spending decision.

Also, why do we consider Core to be like justice league and talk about "miners and CEOs" as dirty scums that are second row citizens. Protecting Bitcoin and developing business on top of it are 2 very important aspects.

Hook up directly with miners in your neighborhood. They might even sell you without spread because they need to get rid of BTC to pay for electricity and costs... Also, hook up with HODL-ers, they as well need to cash out from time to time.

1) Not everyone can Invest in USA sp500
2) USA had a major run in last 80 years, not sure if it will continue with full force
3) Last year VW stocks fall 20-30% and they were one of the safest there is, it can happen to any stock.
4) you have brockerage fee, taxes and inflation to deduct from your gains
5) there is probably stock market crash coming soon, we'll talk then about your average return
I'm all for investing money, but we are not focusing on that right now. Also, currently crypto blows SP500 out of the water so that is why we are here. 
As a good investor you must have some cash, something highly liquid in order to spend if opportunity presents itself.
Basically, if conversion fees are low enough, everyone will hold crypto over fiat. Why wouldn't you?

Bravo, good and reasonable comment which is rarity in NO2X world.
I like with most of your points however I disagree with conclusion.
If Core is not ready for small compromise over what they think it is best way and demands ABSOLUTE control over protocol I find that bad.
I'd be very sad, but I'd rather see them leave versus bringing community with FUD campaigns into civil war with majority of big business and great majority of miners.

Why shouldn't big corporations and miners have a say in where bitcoin should go?
I mean, if Core can't give us any good TECHNICAL explantation why is 2X bad, how are they any better than 'other guys'? It is just power play and we are voting on popularity contest (since there are no good technical arguments). I've read the post the other day here in r/bitcoin and the guy was saying something like "If Satoshi was Jesus, Core developers are Apostoles". Come on!?!
* S2X Pro:    Cheeper transactions
* S2X Cons:  It will be slightly more expensive to run full node
* Fact: 2Mb increase will happen sooner or latter.
I'm all pro Core but this Civil War with weak arguments makes me thinking that they are steering bitcoin in this direction just so that money that goes to miners goes to L2 nodes instead. This doesn't have to be necessary bad thing, however let the market decide this by giving them an option to use both on-chain and L2 as long as it is possible.
Oh, I've forgot to address you argument that governments will now be able to control Bitcoin through big business. That just don't work like that. Any malicious protocol change will be rejected by community because we are not stupid. Basically no one will run that code. Big Corporations wouldn't run that code in the first place. Currently we are talking about change that will happen sooner or latter, not something hostile. We are accepting this 2X only because of a reason that good portion of community wants it and there is no good reason agains it. 
You can't blow narrative out of proportion to prove your point. That is like if mother asks you to wash the dishes and you answer: "OMG NO! I'm not your slave! I will not wash the dishes because tomorrow you'll ask me to kill a man and I don't want to become a killer!". :)
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:17:59
Yeah, but if chain remains small it will fill up and cost of transactions will rise. That will incentivize users to go off chain on LN. Issue I'm referring is that block limits remains unnecessary low just in order to push users to L2 solutions. 
Because I don't buy their explanation, I'm throwing around theories. :)
Yesterday, I've read on r/BTC that Core is actually pushing us all into PoW change (as they are fighting with miners with no good reason) just so they could sell their own ASIC equipment that they are working on.
I don't know, that is probably not it, but since I'm sceptic in stated motives about no2x I'm open for other theories.

1) Not everyone is American. Many people don't have opportunity to invest in it.
2,3,4,5) you selling stocks investing to high, it is not all flowers and unicorns
6,7) Investors holds bunch of gold, see golds market cap (which is even manipulated down). Most wealthy investitures owns 5-15% net worth in gold. Your point is totally invalid about that. 
Inflationary currencies don't have yield at all. Stocks, bonds and real estates does.
It is simple math, if USD loses value of 2% per year and BitCoin don't lose money or even earns you. Both are safe and highly liquid and/or can easily and cheaply be swapped. Not to mention that one of those can be send anywhere in the world with no fees and no 3 party and can't be confiscated... It is no brainer.
Again, as you are too focused on investment portfolio and investment strategies... In that mind set it is just question how much will you diversify in gold, FIAT, Crypto, yield producing assets, appreciation assets... It really depends and It will change over time. Crypto attacks everyting at the moment. Probably in 20-30 years It might not rise in value enough anymore. And you will not want It because  of that but in that point it will be far superior money and wealth preservation vehicle.

Whoever holds their coins can't manipulate it as easily as gold since bitcoin is highly liquid (anyone can sent in a second all around the world in any quantity) not to mention that from time to time there are money aidrops and what not.
Be cool, more different usages bitcoin finds the better...

You as a buyer are protected by selling agreement, the way you paid for the house is irrelevant. Also, most sales agreements are "bought in seen condition" meaning that you don't get refunds anyways.
Not sure if it is better to buy with credit if you have cash and don't know what better to do with that money. Anyways, problem will occurs as sellers get to sell in BTC, that is the moment when FIAT will collapse as real estate credit is top way for banks/government to inject their confetti money into economy.

I'm not putting effort in promoting 2X, I don't really care if blocks are 1 or 2 Mb, atm it doesn't make much of a difference in any way, shape or form. I'm putting effort into preventing mess that NO2X would be. I hate to see community split. Imo even bCash didn't had to happen. And to split community again because of 1mb or 2mb is so stupid I don't have words.
For example Roger Ver, I respect the shit out of that man for everything he has done and is still doing for bitcoin. He is extremly valuable asset for this community, and I see people shit on him every day. So sad that we took different paths and that could be avoided if people deals less with extrems and YOLO attitude.

Noup, X2 just don’t care as majority chain what will minority chain do. You are not attacking, you are not defending against it...
Simply, you expect BicoinCore to die off and have no business into trying to keep it alive. If CoreCoin thinks they can survive, they are free to try but don’t put on X2 list of responsibilities to try to help them. Also, if what you believe is “the real BitCoin” have to relay on other chains to build replay protection for it to survive, then it is already dead in the water.

Does ability to download 2MB every 10 minutes sounds like something that will lead to serious centralization and nodes switching OFF? I mean, I have internet speed 20Mb per SECOND for 15$/m and I'm living in shitty 3world country.
As of disk space, if all blocks are full (which are not) that would be 8GB per month VS current 4GB per month. 1T hard drive cost around ±50$ dollars today.

Voters are not 'by accident' behave like they do. They do so because they went into schools that teach them how to behave as they do. Also, mass media and internet propaganda are brainwashing them day by day. All that is made possible with our tax money. 
If whole population would understand the system tomorrow will be revolution. Henry Ford said that like 100 years ago and it is still correct today.
Democracy maintains it's power on votes of miss-informed / brain washed people. Because their vote counts "1" same as yours and mine and there is way more of them. People don't care about politics, system etc. Heck, they don't even care for their personal finance...
However, now we can 'vote' with our money since we are high stake holders into system. If enough people move out money out of their corrupted economy / system they will be forced to change since all of a sudden they will not have enough money to keep social peace and system will crash. Remove your money out of the system and move it into Bitcoin and you will see that change by votes you wish for and in the process you will become rich. Not bad deal if you ask me.

It is most likely that one chain will die off soon, so you will not have to do anything.
There is small chance that both chains will survive, in that case someone will create replay protection (or change PoW method) and you will be safe to use both chains. Just stay calm, don't try to do any transactions during fork and follow instructions that Ladger company will provide during this period.

If hard fork happens then possibilities are:
* both chains survives, everyone gets what they bought
* one chain becomes BitCoin other go to 0, winning better gets what he bought, losing better gets nothing.
Problem is if fork don’t happen at all. In that case BT1 wins all, and BT2 looses all.
Basically there are more favourable outcomes for BT1 with current rules set.

@_date: 2017-10-04 22:41:09
We are fighting about Bitcoin (BTC) brand here. It seams that you are assuming that there will be BTC and B2X after hard fork but it could get much more ugly than that...
For example CoinBase, ShapeShift and blockchain.info who are supporting X2 are going to list B2X as BTC and they as we all know have crazy high BTC transaction counts. On the other hand some other business will list CoreCoin as BTC. That will confuse users since they will not know what are they dealing with...
Since great majority of hash will be (at least initially) on B2X coin, that chain will be work normaly while CoreCoin will be super slow with only 5-10% hash power left. Also miners would perform 51% attack as soon as possible to seal the deal given the fact that they need only 3-6% of current hash to do it.
After that business that called CoreCoin BTC, will have to chose will they close their business or accept B2X as "the bitcoin" as well.
I'm not saying that this will happen, I'm asking - What is Cores defense strategy against this scenario?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:34:15
How it is an attempt to "seize control"?
Core (Adam) was literally invited to NYA, but he refused tom come. After meeting Core was welcome to write Segwit2X implementation but they have refused.
Please, don't forget that this is only a 1Mb upgrade to blocks and nothing more.
Only reason why this minor block size increase is so important to Core is because people will less use L2 solutions if there is enough space in on-chain blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:24:04
Sure I can. They should be ready to make small compromise, imho.
Not sure how you fail to see that his words are open thread to leave if things don't go COMPLETELY their way. Is that the developer that you would hire to work in your company? "My way or high way" attitude...
If there was not for NYA, we would go through USAF, which had like 5-10% support... Possibly wouldn't have Segwit just yet... Bitcoin image and price would plumped...
And now we are with this FUD campaign trying to go out of our part of agreement. I don't like that at all.
Who really cares and why if blocks are bumped to 2Mb in 2 months VS in 6-12-18-24 months?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:02:53
I'm not huge fan of this... They are creating asset between user and bitcoin which is not really needed. And how do you know that those companies don't do fractional reserves scheme?
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:39:57
It is small block size increase that whole community except developers agree on. Core (the developers) thinks that this came 6-12 months too early and wants to prevent bitcoin from doing it. This will sadly probably result in another chain split. This is bad for everybody. There will be no winners in this war. :(
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:58:22
Moreover we are spending time and resources debating meaningless change. I bet 95% of community don't care if we go to 2X.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:57:27

If they would, then this is nothing about "firing open source group Core".

Ver said something about he will sell bitcoin core for bitcoin cash (in which he believes) but Now he says that majority of his holdings are still in bitcoin core. Don't know when Will said anything similar and/or threading to leave.

@_date: 2017-09-10 17:33:02
So you are using current economy as a GOOD example? o.0

@_date: 2017-09-30 11:25:30
S2X don' expose BitCoin to government, see my previous comment about that.
I completely agree with last paragraph. How does fight with miners and Big Business over not so important issue like TIMING of block size increase fits that narrative? Basically we are risking Fork, PoW change, confusing users...
Not worth it...
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:55:30
How secure would that new chain really be? What about miners who invested in hardware to secure BitCoin and followed Core until this day (5-10% of hash as of today)? How will you get miners to invest in hardware again if they know that any day, without warning their hardware can be bricked? Do nodes, wallets, businesses have to update their software for this change and how long will that take?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:00:46


Yeah, this ain't gonna happen anywhere in the world. Everyone will face a choice, do you want to hold currency that loses value over time (FIAT) or do you want a currency that gains or stays same over time (Bitcoin). Literally everyone will want to be in second group. If forced to use FIAT we will change it only in time of transaction and not a second earlier. As 15%+ population uses bitcoin, we will be able to swap it with friends, families and guy at every corner using uber-for-crypto app. Exchanges are now popular for big dogs and speculators. They are not nesessery at all in big picture.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:14:36
Ok, what is your technical answer to question why don't we want 2X now?
If blocks fill up we will use extra space if not - we will not. Lightning will have alternative directly in chain which is good thing... And centralization of mining will not be affected especially as Russia, Japanese and USA are getting into the game.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:40:29
Because of superior fundamentals.
Why would anyone hold FIAT that loses value and deal with it's limitations?
Also, it seams to me that we are entering a phase where institutions are jumping in and if so, that is big wall of money that will race in and outbid one other. Especially as whole countries are entering into Bitcoin related projects.
If you ask, why do I think we will stop growth at 5000-6000$, I don't... I just wait for it to be constant above that line.

@_date: 2017-09-03 08:52:15
Hmm... interesting point. Actually BitCoin transaction is way better way to prove how much you pay. You just include transaction number in seller agreement and proof will be there until end of time. Also, it is quite possible that soon enough we will have real estate central registries onto block chain, which will further ease paying with crypto.
So yeas, house example is not best. :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:05:32

I'm sorry that my smiley face made you uncomfortable. I'll put sad smiley, maybe you'll feel better: :(
As I said Core made it "contentious" by opposing it. There will allways be parties that will not agree with any upgrade proposal and that is ok. Anyways, Segwit2X have no obligations to implement replay protection and try to help minority chain to survive. If what you consider real Bitcoin can't handle hard forks without replay protection then it is already dead in the water...
* No, combined with segwit it is a 4Mb to 8Mb block size change, bringing it past the established safe block size of 4Mb
I'm talking about actual block size not amount of transactions you can now squize in.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:04:28
Literally no one said that ever. Even Core devs didn't say that...
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:05:20
I'm keeping both and will keep buying which ever "wins" after HF. I don't care if bitcoin have 1mb or 2mb blocks. I'd prefer if Core is doing the development but if they don't want to respect what both big business and miners wants then maybe they are not good enough team players for this sport.
Btw, you are probably getting most of your info from r/bitcoin and this is Core funboys echo chamber. Go to other sub-reddits, youtube, news sites, conferences... Bitcoin Core, doesn't have as big support as you get impression by hanging around in here.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:00:23
Well Said.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:24:19
I don't think it is delusional. With bitcoin for first time you have chance to opt out of their system. This will weaken them as enough people stop paying for their services and taxes. What happens as someone propose that government keep all their finance and spendings on open public chain for anyone to see. After all they are dealing with our money and we have full right to know exactly how are they spending it.
Bitcoin could bring change in the game, just keep believing and HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:22:13
It is worthless comparing to other currencies or assets so no one wants to take it anymore. Basically, whole economy shifts to something more stable like USD, EUR or maybe even BTC.

It's a freaking block size change that will happen sooner or latter and everyone agrees on that. Dafuq is with all FUD-ing?
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:34:50
If bitcoin makes sense for you and you are living in country with 2-5% inflation, think if it makes sense for someone who lives in country with 2000-5000% inflation per mont or even a week. 
People are trading their FIAT for whatever they can, for some bitcoin is great choice. Only reason why there is not more bitcoin usage is because they are not technologically advanced enough yet, but they are learning fast.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:49:26
"Everyone" will be what? 0.1% of todays hash? 1%?
It will be non-secure network since anyone with relatively small investment could fuck it up. Miners are playing very important role by securing bitcoin. Cores narrative lately is to down play that but lets stay objective about it.
I'd be scared to do any serious transactions on network with such low security.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:44:13
* Even if, say, 95% of miner hashing power moves to the B2X chain, this doesn’t “kill” Bitcoin (BTC), it merely makes the blocks take slower to confirm, and gives time for users and the market to adjust.
What about 51% attack?
95% of miners go mine Bitcoin2X that means that only initial 5% of original hash has left on CoreCoin. Eventually in couple of weeks/month difficulty will drop and what then? Any miner from original chain that have relatively small 6% of original 100% can jump to BTC and attack it. Basically anyone could attack it with relatively small money investment. Who would have courage to do any transaction on that block chain?
Only reasonable path for CoreCoin if miners abandon them is to change PoW...
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:35:39
Nothing. If tech is any good it will be on 2X shortly after or even before, same goes for numbers of alts. Basically this is not selling point for CoreCoin at all.

I understand that no one bothered to attack BCH since that coin is a joke. If it comes to hard fork there will be arm race which fork is the real bitcoin. If other fork attacks CoreCoin to death that means that Bitcoin2X is now real Bitcoin. 70BIL is in stake! Power players already are gambling with millions on outcome...
Last thing I'd count on is that there will be NO attack.
Especially, since if BitcoinCore after Hard Fork and difficulty adjustment ends up only 5-10% of todays hash. That means that anyone controling 2.6% - 5,1% of todays hash could perform successful attack. Attack would be so cheep that it makes no sense not to attack it... :/
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:22:57
I’ve tried to ask several times, once got censured, once down voted without answer, but I’ll try asking again since I think it is important and related to this post:
What is defense strategy for 51% attack if Bitcoin remains with 5-10% hash rate after hard fork and difficulty adjustment? Anyone who controls 3%-6% of today’s hash power will be able to perform successful 51% attack...
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:26:10
Giving a opinion that don't fit r/bitcoin agenda is not attack on Bitcoin.

Last recession was caused by real estate bubble burst. What was typical for it was that people were leaving their home or selling it for whatever they could. This way people were defaulting/closing their mortgages meaning that banks had to destroy all that money they created and injected in economy when they were emitted loans (see: fractional reserves). Since there were less USD in circulation + people was scare to spend it because of uncertainty dollars went up. That is why FED is doing quantitative easing (printing money) trying to "save" dollar from going to strong.
Point is, next recession doesn't have to be like that. There are too many variables and no one is Sure how IT will play out.

To be honest, only difference between “Holy BT1” and “Gov takeover biz coin” is in 1Mb of block size. I don’t care at all about that minor change. I hate the fact that Core refuses to collaborate with business and miners and that BitCoin is stagnant for 2-3 years  because of this very reason. This Civil War that we are pushed into I put totally on Cores shoulders. They should just implement 2X and get done with it.
I don’t plan to gamble in future markets (especially ones on Core loving exchanges), being in Crypto is risky enough for me. Other then that those “smart and brave” traders on future markets and early dumpers got worst possible prices for their BCH, so it doesn’t make much sense for me...
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:07:02
Actually they are not reliable at all since this current offering is favoriting BTC1. One might say that is deliberately put in this way so BTC1 have higher number giving it false sense of worth.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:09:01
Because it will be singular event where you will switch 70 billion network to be secured with “everyone’s CPU”.  There is a good reason why BitCoin is most secure coin there it and that is massive hash by ASIC miners. There will be huge difference in value relative to security after PoW change. Security can’t jump up over night. Price can go down over night, if someone even dares to do transactions and there is no 51% attack on new algo.
Also, why would Miners invest hardware into CoresCoin as they change algo randomly without warning?
I don’t believe that BT1 will worth anything close to 70 bill after fork but I’ve explored your assumption just to illustrate you how wrong you are about that.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:25:58
Listening to Andreas is never "wast of time", he is literally on of most respected person in Bitcoin community.
Block size is inevitable because at one point as user base grows transaction fees will get high and there will be no reason to charge that if we can increase block size and make them cheeper.

Nothing is really wrong with it.
It is just simple increase from 1Mb to 2Mb of block size.

Whole bitcoin economy and miners are against Core at this point. What is easier to replace? Few developers and few forum moderators or whole BitCoin infrastructure build with millions or even billion of dollars? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:56:45
This is how Charlie would LIKE CoinBase to handle 2X upgrade/fork. Maybe he is right, probably he is not...
* This only works if everyone did this. Because this is a hardfork, if not everyone upgrades, then there will be 2 chains. The supporters of 2x and the NYA agreement believe that if all the mining hashrate switches over to the 2x chain, the original chain will be dead and no one would use it.
You don't have to believe anything, it is pure math. If Core have a plan (which is not PoW change) how are they planning to survive miners abandonment now is the time to tell us.
* But how is that different than fiat currency, where miners decide (by fiat) that your old bills are no longer valid? Thankfully, Bitcoin doesn’t work this way. It’s the people who use the coin that gives it value, and miners will mine the coin that makes them the most money. And right now, pretty much all the Bitcoin Core developers and a large part of the community including a lot of prominent figures in this space have come out against this hardfork.
Sure, anyone have freedom to use whichever protocol they choose. Similar to that any business have a freedom to support it it or not. Bitcoin Gold (which is another bitcoin fork that is about to happen in following weeks) probably will not be listed on CoinBase, there is no garantie that BitcoinCore will be listed as well. Of course if it turns out that BitcoinCore gains enough momentum and have non-laughable price it will earn its spot on exchanges.

If I recall right, there was a discussion that 2X should be implemented at the same time as SegWit, but whole r/bitcoin with Core as spiritual leaders was advocating that 2X should be "sometimes in the future". Well it turns out that 6 months is "sometimes in the future", so that is what NYA agreed upon. Maybe it is not ideal by some parameters, but it hardly "worst decision ever" as r/bitcoin is portrating it right now.
This arguments basically answering "rushed" part which is 5-7 of your bullets.
Reasons agains S2X are mostly because part of community rejecting it , not about S2X itself. Basically you are arguing that something is bad because in case you reject it that would bring you complications.
Most interesting points you made are actually about the technology: "effects of segwit, signature aggregation and mast...".
I hear you and I get that you believe that this is good path for bitcoin. I'm with you on this but lets wait and see. However, why not just enable more transactions on good-old block-chain with conservative 2Mb blocks while we wait? Large part of community wants it and we don't have good reason against it.

If Bitcoin can't endure "hard fork attacks" on protocol level and relaying on exchanges or law makers to protect it then it is dead in the water.

Yeah, I have that in my country as well. 
But I have problem with term "Free", because it is not, it is "Pre-paid". You pay it even if you like or need a service or not. They have monopoly over your health or school and you can't fire them.
I guess it all boils down to level of coruption. If money taxpayers pay makes it all the way down to end service then system can work well enough. However, there is a reason why USA is leading technologival advancement in the world in last 100 years and that is exactly because they don't have expensive safety net for everyone to pay. Therefor rich can become REALY rich and poor can become really poor. Both are strong motivator for prople to do their best work and to move there to do their best work.

No, they don't want a lash. They want to pay someone to deal with some problems we are collectively facing. Similar as tenants pay cleaning lady to clear common space in building. 
At the moment we are facing situation where cleaning lady is overcharging everyone, putting them in cage if they don't want to pay, taking them money before any work is done etc.
Cleaning lady is way overpowered and we need to find different solution, if that means that everyone will clean in front of its door for a while, fine.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:55:21
BOTH are solutions to scalling.
Why would we keep block size artificially low without good reason? Are you aware that on-chain transaction price goes UP as blocks are filled? Why would we want to pay more for transaction if we don't have to?
LN will not be ready until who know when, and we don't know how are they gonna perform. What if Amazon really wants to go in as early as Oct-Nov as some are speculating?

No, only nodes with transactions count. More transactions = Bigger impact...
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:39:23
 I hear what you saying but increasing "confirmed" number to 100 would cause people to wait days for transactions. Also, it is pain in the butt to update all wallets. And again, you don't really solve anything. 
 51% doesn't have to be only about double spending. It can be DoS attack as well, which is bad as well if it lasts for long time and since it would be relativelly cheep to do it if only 5-10% of current hash stays on BitcoinCore then it is easy to imagine it happening...
PoW change would cause so much trouble to everyone, it would take months if ever for everyone to upgrade. I guess it is good that for a while mining wouldn’t be centralized but now miners know the game, they would centralize it as fast as they can IF they even decide to invest in blockchain which randomly, without warning changes PoW. If price of BitcoinCore remains high with new PoW, wouldn’t that be a honey pot for malicious actors to attack the block chain? More hash == more security. What I want to say is that I’d be scared to do transaction on that chain.
If price drops, if chain becomes shorter, if PoW is changed, if nodes count drop off due upgrade, big business don’t consider BitcoinCore a BitCoin...
How will we be able to hang on to and say with straight face: “We are the real BitCoin?”

It is risky enough to even be in crypto, gambling with my money on fork winner is not additional risk I want to take.

Miners will abandon you, your legacy block chain will become unusable without new blocks, good know what then... you will probably try to change PoW which will fail...

AML/KYC is possible today as under 1% of people are using bitcoins. There are few ON/OFF ramps and bitcoins rare change hands... In the future, if bitcoin reaches 10% of population, it will be impossible to track what is going on. There will be bunch of anonymous (as you said even legal ones) ON/OFF ramps, and people will pay bitcoin directly for anything they can. Doing business only as known customer to a corporation is becoming an obsolete concept. Not to mention that people that wants to be anonymous find their way easily even today.
Government taxation as we know it will change as bitcoin hit mainstream. Bitcoin creates financial blackhole that will eat lion share of digital transactions on top of already anonymous cash transactions. It will be too easy to avoid taxes and governments will have to find a way to deal with it somehow or change their business model.

You earn your cash and pay taxes on it. So it is yours, fair and clean.
Now let's consider this example, the other day I've decided to buy a new kitchen table. There is a guy that lives next to me who is skilled with this kind of stuff and has agreed to create a new table for me. I feel good if I give money to my neighbor and support local economy instead of paying to some companies and banks and 3 more hands in the process before it gets to the guy that actually made the table. I'll pay him anonymously with cash or bitcoin. And actually that table will be cheeper for me and the guy that created it will earn more. Magic, Isn't it? :)
The question is, are we doing something bad by trading directly like this?
I think that we are not, and that IRS shouldn't be trying to monitor and take a cut from transactions that it is not invited into. If nether of us (buyer and seller) don't want what government brings to the table in transaction (consumer protection, quality control etc.), government shouldn't collect tax on our transaction.
If we want to keep this possible, we need to fight for our privacy otherwise we are headed for dark-dark future.

Sounds good but Is this 1 really enforceable? If Nodes have to do this manually, some/many could drop off... Even od sucesfully cordinated - What if attack continues for a long time? BitCoin would basically stop during attack, right? It would turn into DoS attack?

I disagree. BitCoin course should be combination of weighted interest of business, miners, developers, users... I have feeling that currently only devs are pulling all the strings and want absolute control. This is the reason why other parts of community wants to get rid of them and I agree with them actually as of lately. If Core can’t make a simple compromise like increase blocks by 1Mb they should be replaced.
Also we should, if able, offer users to use both on-chain and off-chain solutions and let the market decide. Core with keeping blocks to 1Mb is creating unneeded limit so that 2Ln solutions looks better. I’m not saying that L2 is wrong path but let the market decide by offering both.

I think that if we get to the point that bitcoin where bitcoin has reached mainstream adoption and is worth "millions of dollars" with small volatility governments will have to change it's status from asset to currency.
Currently one could argue that today bitcoin is used by far as a store of value (as gold). However, that could easily change in the future (someone said LN?) and as bitcoin starts to change hands often then it will have to gain currency status.

Think about how much new money is injected in system every 10 minutes 12.5 BTC x [price], today that is about 34.500$. Someone buys that with fresh dollars. Imagine if all of a sudden there is same 34.500$ dollars wanting to buy, but only 6.25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes to be sold. Price of each Bitcoin would have to grow since buyers will outbid each other.
Sure, supply is also filled with hodlers who wants to sell theirs BTC, however it seams that demand is greater then supply since BTC is gaining in value over time so if this trend continues, inflation halving will be significant factor. See what happened last year when halving happened.
Same thing will happen no matter .5%, .25%, .12%... All it matters is that there is half of it available on the market from this moment on. Maybe it will not go double but 70-80% increase easily.

1) USA is irelevant. Rest of world wants to use something other then dollars as global reserve and here it is - bitcoins is slowly maturing. If USA ban it , as you are suggesting, great, they just failed to buy ticket for the future. That might slow BitCoin a bit but that will destroy USAs economical future. USA have some of best BitCoin companies that will move somewhere else and create jobs there. It is as if they ban internet because it is hard to spread propaganda. Negative sides are much greater then positive.
2) They can't buy everything. If the start to buy large amounts price will rise. Other countries will see that USA gov started to buy big so they will get in the race with them making it even more sky rocketing. And many holders would not want to sell if they don't need money at that moment. Why would they, they can just sit it out and become billionaires instead of millionaires.
3) Even if this does happen, who cares? They bought it and push price up and made adoption skyrocket. If anything I'd be glad if a country does this. What is bad about this?

Governments will not try to disrupt bitcoin. At worst (mostly for them) they will ban bitcoin in their country.

Well, if they get in situation to have both FIAT and Bitcoin circulating, citizens can easily change between them... And it turns out that bitcoin raises in value in contrast to FIAT which loses value, not to mention other benefits of bitcoin related to FIAT, what do you think, which one citizens will chose?
In my country local currency is shit which have way higher inflation then EUR/USD so we convert everything we have saved into foreign currency. Same will happen with bitcoins, why wouldn't you? Not only you don't lose wealth to inflation, but your money rise in value. and you can easily get in and out... Perfect!
Sure, government can keep ban doing business in anything else then FIAT they are printing, but if you keep only pocket money in fiat and/or change it on the fly at time of transaction and do transactions directly in bitcoins to whoever wants to accepts it, it doesn't really matter?
I don't think government will give up on FIAT but I do think they will be forced to stop using it to extract wealth from citizens.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:21:28
No government wants to ban bitcoin, that would be crazy since citizens would miss ride to the moon of new global asset. Later, as enough people have bitcoin in their pockets government can't and shouldn't stop them doing business with it.

hmmm... interesting. However I'm not sure this applies to case of BTC-e. 
Customers of BTC-e are not "suspected of involvement with crime", therefor I don't see a way for government to steal (forfeiture) their money. Even if BTC-e gets prosecuted for money laundry for some big players or MtGox, what that got to do with all BTC-e customers? They are mostly fair, honest people that don't care about all of that and just wants to trade bitcoin. What do they have with USA and their s**t?
Like, if bank is charged for money laundry (as it should be) I highly doubt that gov will take money from all of its customers that got nothing to do with what bank does behind closed door and ask them to prove to be innocent or something.

I see that is going to develop somehow like this:
Countries around the world will continue to have stance similar as to day which is essentially: "Ok, dear citizens, buy bitcoin at your own risk but tell us if you do so for tax purposes". If that trend keeps for couple more years, and it becomes obvious that bitcoin will stay and become more popular, governments will then get into race to buy as much as they can. Believe it or not, no country in the world likes to do international trading in USD which USA can print as much as likes. Also, whichever country get last into new world settlement currency will have back seat in new world order, so they can't not go into the race. It will be glorious event to behold.

When, or better to say IF, they ever get back to 2-3-4% inflation every sane person will use bitcoin which will have like 0.5% inflation by then and even better, going up since more and more people wants to jump in.

**What government get if they constrain bitcoin?**
They can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by printing more FIAT.
They can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by controlling money flow and taking (overblown) taxes.
**What government lose if they constrain bitcoin?**
It's citizens will miss on buying new global asset when it is cheap and that will basically destroy that country economically in the world where bitcoin is becoming more and more popular. For example when Bolivians finally starts to buy bitcoins in couple of years they will have to pay $10.000, $15.000, $20.000 for something that rest of the world buys now for $3000 (not to mention that smartest/luckiest bought it for way less). That would be financial suicide for Bolivia.
Since governments are not stupid, there is only couple of governments in the world that are really banning bitcoin and other cryptos.
**Why would Average Joe wanted to deal with Bitcoin?**
Because bitcoins will not lose value over time. It only makes sense to keep any savings in a currency that losses as little value as possible over time. Citizens who lives in countries with good currencies with low inflations like EUR/USD don't really understand this ATM, however rest of the world only keeps pocket money (like one month salary) in domestic currency and all savings in better currencies like USD/EUR. Citizens of those less fortunate countries often do business directly with better currency if able and even price things in better currency with disclaimer "paid with local (shitty) currency with exchange rate at the time of buying". Anyways, if bitcoin becomes stable and widely used he will have smaller inflation (even negative inflation) then any FIAT currency and therefor become default choice for any savings everywhere. Not to mention that it is permissionless, borderless, and all other good things. Problem is that citizens of countries with shitty currencies are not early technology adopters. It just takes a bit more time for them to get infrastructure and right mind set. As someone said the other day: "For Bitcoin to win it just needs to survives a bit longer."

Why would they ask your for an ID?
Can you, in your country, swap currencies at exchange office without ID part?

Whats there to read about? Why would any state/bank share tax information and say "no" to a very lucrative industry of hiding peoples money? They say it as a smoke screen but they never actually do it. Just ask Donald Trump, Lionel Messi and other rich people who hide their money from tax collectors how do they do it. Remember when EU has ruled that Apple should pay to Ireland 12.000.000.000 in name of avoiding taxes and Ireland said: "Noup, all is good. We don't want that money". What that tells you?
As of blocking apps, you are able to install on your device whatever you want. If something is banned from 'official app store' that is just slightly inconvenience, that is all.

Freelancer, elance, 99designs... don't support bitcoin transactions.

Banks don't like THIS technology. 
Also banks don't have money. They can't buy bitcoin with fractional reserve issued dollars since since those MUST to go into citizen debt, not in buying crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:34:51
We all are into bitcoin because it is non-regulated, non-centralized. What would I do if bitcoin becomes regulated and centralized? Look for alternative? Fight?
Ultimately, that would mean that they won and we lost... :(
What would you do? Just go with IMFCoin?

Sure they do. Their main purpose now days is to pump debt money into the economy and that will no longer be necessary. How are they going to issue loans without fractional reserves scheme?
I only see them necessary in crypto world to provide some sort of protection for people who choose not to care them self about big cold storage of Bitcoins.

I've been through hyper inflation. It is not like world is ending, first neighbor trying to eat you, no food, no electricity... I mean, it is bad, but not as bad as you think. Economy is still ok, but monetary system is not. People here rushed as soon as they get paycheck to buy foreign currency. 
Also, during inflation what happened is big money transfer to packets of those who knew how to get best of it. So you can really look at it as a chance.

Yeah and all the people will use non-regulated code... hmmm
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:24:32
I've been through hyper inflation. Thing is, in those situation you don't really care what government says. You just want to get the hell out from that currency no matter what law will you brake or what premium will you pay. You know, because unless you do that you will just have to look and wave as your life saving vanishes into the night...

I doubt that you would be able to convert 'copious amounts of money' on a bitcoin ATM in a mall. There is probably some limit in place. :)
However, I don't get how is converting money to bitcoin any different then burying cash in the ground? Criminals would know what to do with stolen money. You know, it is their job to figure it out. They go to 'work 8 hours per day' to come up with ideas.
I hate to be the one that brakes this to you but KYC is not asked for in order to catch professional criminals or terrorists. Actually its only purpose is to make hard for ordinary people to avoid taxes.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:19:58
Bitcoin is way more decentralized than anything else we have. Obvious proof is scaling debate.
If banks and governments in some country choose to ban bitcoin (so far not a single government did this) that will slow adoption in that country and that same country will be left behind in new world order if bitcoin lives to its potential.
But even with government banning it, all you need is another finance crisis and/or big inflation.

What works in China and Russia? 
If there is a point in time where IMF hijacks Bitcoin with its 'regulated code' (which I highly-highly doubt) everyone will just move to other non-regulated crypto. It is much easier for IMF to bootstrap their IMFCoin then to try to hijack Bitcoin. 
Also, there is no way that 'world central banks' is created. Because, who will control it? Russians? Americans? EU? China? Should it be fair, and no special benefits for anyone?

It's not about "I don't like paying taxes". It is about "I don't like for someone to mismanage and steal my money".
But it is not even about taxes. Are you seriously think that government monitoring all of you transaction is a good thing? Maybe you'd like to explore more about topic of "cashless society" and what consequence are...
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:28:48
Well, it solves completely anonymous exchange of money which is useful if you want to evade taxes. ;)

How will that stop anything? Criminals can deal in any of 1000s of crypto currencies?
That project is solely for capital control for common citizens and it is going to fail... They are just burning money.

I'm not sure banks will be able to make crypto-loans and people will not want those loans anyways. 
In order to give loans they will have to have crypto in the first place as no one will 'save' crypto at the bank. Only if bank promise to pay interest in crypto for savers which I doubt they will be able to deliver. Also bank will not be able to do fractional reserve landing on money they do have... So I don't see crypto landing as a 'thing'. Maybe as something very different from what we know today.
Not to mention that people would avoid taking loans in crypto since it will just rise in value as time goes by. Imagine if you had take loan in crypto when BitCoin was 100$. :D
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:40:03
Maybe those are some other coins that you have sold to that guy? You know, ones that you have just bought (moved from your cold to hot storage), and ofc, your were totally gonna submit that in the annual tax report...

I like that quote. :)
However, I think that you are putting more trust then you should in governments ability to cooperate together. They can't even come together on climate control agreement, just ask Donald Trump. :D
If they had a power to stop the Internet based technology they'd stop Wikileaks first. Don't know if you remember, USA has cut off all financing from Assange, they blocked his credit cards, pay pall, even Swiss account... But they couldn't block Bitcoin. Assange asked for donations in Bitcoin and that helped him remain live and helped wikileaks remain up and running.
Even if they block ports and what not, people will find a way around this. As long as there is a way for malicious program to get into your device, there is a way for anything else. 
Just, keep calm and cyber punk. ;)
