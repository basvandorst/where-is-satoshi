From the paper, emphasis mine.




overlay network. **If the size or properties of the network change, that would
affect the X% effective throughput.** We note, however, that Bitcoin’s overlay
network has remained stable in size from Nov. 2014 to Nov. 2015 at between
∼4500 to ∼6300 full nodes


can achieve only limited benefits given the network performance induced
by Bitcoin’s current peer-to-peer overlay network protocol while maintaining its
**current degree of decentralization**
Given that they say


us to the position that **fundamental protocol redesign is needed** for blockchains to scale significantly while retaining their decentralization.
And then go on to list possible changes like:
* Make the network layer better
  * **Good idea, people are working on it**
* Change consensus to work like Proof of Stake, through a consortium, or sharding / hierarchy
  * **Solutions that are either arguably less decentralized or certainly less decentralized**
And then get EVERYTHING they say about sidechains wrong, what you're doing here is saying:
Some article, which does not even give proper scope to the paper, is saying that 4 MB would be safe for the network if these assumptions are fine:
* That the current degree of decentralization is sufficient
* That the current node count is sufficient and could even be a little smaller
* That ultimately Bitcoin can't scale anyway unless it adopts less decentralization, Proof of Stake, or unknown solutions to known problems are found.
The paper is academic.  It at least defines stuff.  It doesn't define or use the word *safe*.  It does not say that 4 MB are *safe*.  That you think its findings carry that assumption implicitly tells the whole story.  You don't particularly care about decentralization.  And more frighteningly, you think the Bitcoin network in its current form is entirely safe from the problems meant to be avoided by decentralization.  That's an assumption I'm certainly glad Core doesn't make.
Maybe if the authors understood sidechains a little better, they would see some of their unknown solutions have already been found.


scaling is to create a hierarchy of lower-tier “consensus instances,” commonly
referred to as “sidechains.” Sidechains can potentially have a lower degree of decentralization
than the top-level blockchain (**Or Equivalent or even greater**). Sidechains may also run non-proofof-work
consensus protocols, such as BFT(**Wow, so they can do stuff that the paper has mentioned might help scale Bitcoin without changing Bitcoin?**). One sidechain structure, proposed by
Back et al. [15], permits transactions to move funds among independent chains.
The introduction of sidechains raises three technical challenges. First, the
sidechains must be secured independently of the main blockchain. Merged mining
techniques [15] allow separate chains to share their mining power, but require
miner coordination. Without such coordination, the maintenance of sidechains
dilutes the mining power in the system, rendering the individual chains vulnerable(**Merged mining simply requires miners to want to merge mine.  By this logic, owning a miner but not using it 'dillutes' the mining power of Bitcoin**)  Second, if sidechains are widely adopted, the chances that a given source
of funds and a desired destination are on the same sidechain are small, requiring
inter-chain transactions. Inter-chain transactions will have to go through the
main blockchain, possibly requiring two separate transactions, and therefore may
place more of a burden on the main blockchain and thus have an adverse impact
on scalability. (**Completely false.  Atomic swaps**) Finally, transactions involving more than one decentralized chain
may incur high latency. Decentralized blockchains require the accumulation of
a number of blocks to ensure that a transaction will remain in the blockchain
with high probability. Transactions among chains will require a sequence of such
block accumulations, one per chain.  (**Again.  Arbitrage.  Atomic Swaps.  These aren't technical challenges.  They're risk and market decisions**)
@_date: 2016-04-15 04:52:00
Sidechain arbitrage markets makes sidechains the 'let the market decide' solution.  Cross-chain Lightning channels make sidechain arbitrage markets exceedingly efficient.  The end result is your bitcoins are liquid on a network that scales.

The only thing other cryptos do is change parameters against decentralization.  Nothing going faster than Bitcoin actually scales.
Also: How many Ether will there be in the year 2025?  Nobody's sure because there will definitely be forks that change issuance policy, whether directly or as a result of whatever 'new cutting edge' adjustments are made to the consensus algorithm.

Lightning peers cost non-negligible fees to connect with though.  That makes the topology different than Bitcoin's.  Service providers operating at economies of scale to manage channel liquidity amongst themselves and users makes sense.  Yes, that's similar to banking, but with the huge caveats that custody of balances can still remain in user's hands, and with a low enough barrier to entry to make monopoly impossible.
I think what we disagree on here is how much users will run from the idea of incurring even a $1 cost to 'use' their wallet in the face of 'free' provided by others.  Most people use Bitcoin through Coinbase.  
Since the block size cannot grow for the foreseeable future, that $1 fee might be more, too.  I think this is all great though.  The High Velocity Now coins don't understand the importance of a these connections weighted by liquidity and will be far more subject to bubbles than they realize.  Of course, many of them would rather just start managing the monetary supply in the face of this, which they don't realize yet either.

Lightning makes arbitrage between sidechains cheaper.  The block size does not have to increase to allow for 100 trillion entities to create 10 trillion channels a day.

It's not a straw man because it's exactly what you're saying.
The pro big block posts started the exact same morning that Coinbase launched its BCH exchange.  You can believe what you want on that, I was here.
Who defines urgency in Bitcoin?  It's FOSS.  If you have an issue you consider urgent, you can submit code or analysis to the exact same review process that fostered $15,000 bitcoins into existence and it will be critiqued and then implemented if it stands up to critique.
This urgency has been manufactured for four straight years.  Four straight years, you understand this, yes?  For four years, everything you have said has been said, and it has been vetoed by both the market and the peer review process.  If you are actually a concerned investor, you might start by educating yourself on why Bitcoin seems to work, and every attack on it has failed.
Or you can continue being pedantic and posting links to logical fallacies like an asshat while divesting your bitcoins to me, as I take a proven scientist in the crypto space at face value.  I win either way, really.

You want Bitcoin to increase the blocksize.  The Bitcoin peer review process has reviewed multiple proposals and not considered them for implementation.  You think this is wrong.  Another project, Bitcoin Cash, is nearly indistinguishable from Bitcoin except that it has an increased block size and a different, albeit less transparent development process.  You own bitcoins, which are valued more than BCash.  You are certain that the block size is the reason bitcoins are not worth more today than they would be if it was bigger.  You can buy BCash with your bitcoins and get exactly what you want.  There are a great many things you can do besides convince the community of something the community has signaled time and time again that it doesn't believe in. 
Bitcoin is a protocol that assumes rational self interest.  That you do not do what you say is in your interest is not considered valuable here.  That you believe you are right in your beliefs without being able to provide analysis or code in the form of a BIP, and with existing alternatives that map to your beliefs available to you, provides zero incentive for us to value you.  You're either being disingenuous, or insufferably stupid.
You're complaining that something you own is not what you want it to be while you have the opportunity to purchase exactly what you want at a reduced rate according to your own fucking logic.
You're attributing loss of value of an asset over a time frame of two days in the face of thousand percent gains for the year to the people that built it.  Boo fucking hoo.

Well said.
Blockspace is analogous to any commodity in that it'd be cheaper to use if there were more of it readily available, but we'd be less likely to better economize about our usage.  Just look at humanity's relationship with petroleum.  Massive demand prompted massive supply.  We'll never truly know the external costs in terms of geopolitical posturing about it, and ecological costs, etc..  The same can be said of money itself.  Bitcoin is a chance to do better than we have with long-term economics.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:06
Just to recap:
BCash being used less than BTC and carrying less economic weight than BTC, in tandem with a post containing a graphic showing that BCash nodes are mostly run on rented hardware in data centers, and the influx of posts on this subreddit supporting BCash and a block size increase, all signal that Nick Szabo's description of it as centralized sock puppetry is inaccurate and only justifiable from an appeal to authority.

Bandwidth requirements aren't BLOCKSIZE / BLOCK_INTERVAL if you're forwarding.  I run a node on a dedicated dual core i3 with 6 gigs of RAM behind a 20 mbit connection that costs $65 a month in one of the biggest cities in the United States. A single service that utilizes the blockchain + the node itself has me damn well utilized.  A 2 year old, $150 router has an awful time with QoS at 1 MB and around 30 connections.  At 4 MB, I am most definitely off the network if I want to do anything other than run a Bitcoin node.
Also, what do you have against the Mongols?  If I was the CEO of Bitcoin, I might think getting Bitcoin into areas that aren't already saturated with currency and financial tools would be a pretty good idea.  I wouldn't stall the entire project to do it, but I sure as hell would make it a priority.
At 8 MB, even the western world would struggle to keep very many nodes online.  All for a whopping ~50 extra transactions a second.  It's all besides the freaking point when you consider the alternatives to scaling like Lightning and Sidechains and the benefits of keeping Bitcoin requirements marginal.
I've got an idea.  Why don't we not hand over the keys to Bitcoin to Silicon Valley for a couple years based on science that could not possibly represent itself as in the same realm of rigor as that being done by people who have been intimate with the Bitcoin project for 6 years on solutions that by nearly all accounts of those with deep knowledge of the facets of Bitcoin will be wildly more successful than a large blocksize increase with nearly none of the downsides?  People that don't want to keep Bitcoin auditable as close to the edges of the internet as possible simply don't understand it.  They need to calm the fuck down.  They need to understand that a Bitcoin that isn't accessible isn't fucking Bitcoin.  It's banking software subject to governmental mandates and blacklists because those capable of contributing to the network are fewer in number.

NOBODY WINS if any part of the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes a monopoly.  Block size **for sure** increases the capital requirements of any blockchain auditor and thus any Bitcoin blockchain related services.  The same cannot be said of Lightning or Sidechains.  At the rate we're going, we'll probably never get to realize their benefit if a bunch of low brow, non-contributors can just as easily be convinced not to fork towards them as they can be convinced towards increasing the block size without better science behind it.

Because the best way to do it so far would be using an average, but that isn't necessarily the optimal way to curb spam/block size abuse.  You could increase it by some factor every year or day or week, but that is arbitrary compared to the way difficulty is calculated - entirely based on feedback from the network.
Of course, I'd support a marginal increase today just to stay ahead of demand, but the problem with the debate is people not spending time to establish 'the' dynamic block size adjustment algorithm.

Right now I'm stuck on figuring out if it will require a different address layer (because pseudonyms are awesome), or if we'll all use the blockchain to register IPv6 addresses to some key, or if NAT is all we'll need, or what.  There's a ton of work to be done on the problem.  The outline of the standard is starting to come into focus though.

@_date: 2015-06-09 00:23:46


Well yes, establishing the correct algorithm then is hard.  Believe me, I've been trying.  I started off with weighting block size within the set of previous blocks using a normal distribution.  So far that seems alright, but then there's the question of whether you use the weighted average of that set, or if you use those weights to act as an increase/decrease factor of the previous value used to establish the block size.  And then there's the question of how large a window you allow using that value.  None of it's any good unless you can establish some proofs that the derived value is satisfying some requirement about a super majority, which lead me to reading up on [condorcet]( voting, which may be a dead end.  I'm not speaking from ignorance here.

Can someone answer definitively whether the mining power will always be directed to one single pool?  It makes sense to me that if Apple wants to subsidize iPhone costs by adding some mining power in each of them, then that mining power will be directed back to Apple's pool (or whoever they contract or whatever).  But just as walled garden devices exist in a market with modular devices today, a configurable chip for my ATX machine makes sense as well, allowing me to target my mining power to any pool I like.  I then get the utility benefit of having some satoshis... by being able to make commits to the WWL.  Maybe Apple's devices just buy you a discount on the device or apple store credits or maybe they don't care about that and the utility of that ability to write to the WWL is worth including the hardware to configure to your heart's desire (or all 3!), but to me it seems like 'making money off of everyone mining' isn't 21's angle beyond the hardware (and probably becoming a leader in whatever services are related to being able to write to the blockchain).  
If you think about it this way: In the same way you want a newer GPU so you can render graphics better, you'll want a newer ASIC because you'll want to be able to make more writes to the WWL.  Of course that isn't a perfect parallel because you can't buy an additional fixed amount of 'renders' on top of your graphics card like you could with writes to the WWL, but (in theory) you can buy a streaming service for games on top of otherwise insufficient hardware.

In theory because I could make you spend time figuring out whether a very large block is valid or not without needing hash power.  Or I could dedicate some optimal amount of my hash power to producing huge blocks that include a lot of fairly meaningless, but valid transactions and force nodes to check them.
I tend to agree with you though.  You could dynamically scale your acceptable block size limit based on previous blocksizes and the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed that you know about.  I'm not even sure if spammers could push that window up.  If they submit a bogus block, you just disconnect them.  Miners that want to spend time pushing the blocksize up one block at a time are the problem I guess.  Need to think this through.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:36:44


I think it's just about establishing a protocol that acknowledges the interplay between the security provided by miners and the utility provided by nodes.  The easier it is to run a node, the more use cases that fall into the scope of bitcoin.  I ultimately agree with you, but we need a way of proving it.
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:45:42
Just to sum: You want to decrease your stales, but that's only achieved by winning blocks, or being closer to people that win blocks, or by others building smaller blocks (but that's a network wide decrease so that's no net benefit to you).  You can increase your chances of winning blocks by creating larger blocks when you win such that other's stales increase.  Over time, producing larger blocks should lead to a net increase in your hashing power relative to others (assuming the imbalance in hardware and connectivity stays the same).  So beyond cramming as many paying transactions into your block, block creators are incentivized to increase their block size further.
But at some point, your larger blocks will increase the chance of them being orphaned, as those on the other sides of the network will be slower to accept them.  So some kind of equilibrium exists here whereby abusing blocksize further can reduce the network as it reduces yours or others' rewards below a threshold.  If hash rate is spatially distributed, then this isn't a huge concern.  If it isn't distributed that way, then the network folds back towards where it's stronger.  So worst case for you is you're ultimately fighting for a larger share of a fixed or shrinking network.  Best case for you (to further abuse blocksize) is adding some profitable friction to the network's expansion, but this is tolerable.
But stakeholders in the network can achieve better than linear growth as additional participants are added per Metcalfe's Law (R=N^2 ).  
If we could rank the most profitable outcomes:
1. Increasing your share of the network while the network increases in participants
2. Maintaining your share while the network increases in participants
3. Losing less share of the network than the square root of your share for each additional participant added
4.  Increasing share and the number of participants staying the same
But trying to achieve 1 or 2 by abusing blocksize seems to contradict the addition of new participants, so the only thing you can truly optimize for is rank 3.


This was the point that I was missing the first go-around.  I won't say I have a good argument for it, but I will say:  Pools and their miners have operating costs in terms of bandwidth though.  To grow, a pool has to reach farther out in terms of physical distance.  [Nick Szabo has some interesting thoughts on the effects of reducing costs relative to distance and their effects on the net reward to the network](  


I'll have to do a bit of work trying to integrate that into an argument for why pools may be forced into 'less' share over time as well, and then tie some of this stuff together better, but the idea is that abuse at the cost of the network's growth simply doesn't pan out, and that trying to centralize -&gt; abuse at the cost of the network's growth.

The problem with this implementation is you can still drive the block size up easily and in not that much time.  So block congestion is still a tool for the resource rich.  A self-scaling method will require the block size to be able to go both ways.  We basically need a formula that helps incentivize miners to keep the block size as small as possible while still allowing it to increase.  Or put another way, one that punishes miners for submitting larger blocks relative to the current max by reducing the next valid block size by some proportion of max / current block size (probably not a linear one).  As TX fees become a larger percentage of miner revenue, miners will value scarcity in the block anyway, so ultimately we need a way to punish the network for more transactions.  We know that miners still indirectly value more transactions because more transactions implies more adoption, which implies more demand for BTC, which implies a better exchange rate.  There's a way to balance these things, we just have to figure it out.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:15:52
Yeah, so if hashing power isn't distributed, then bitcoin doesn't work.  That hasn't changed.  The block size problem is about how evenly distributed that hashing power is in 'space', and how non-mining nodes (who are 'equally' important in the ecosystem) are affected.

Meanwhile I'm out here wishing I could be on that mailing list LOL.  I understand that perspective though.  My view of it is Gavin is sourcing the community while using his pull in that community.  Economics is always political and vice versa.  Look at it this way: This discussion among other things has someone like me completely floored about bitcoin.  I'm dedicating as many hours as I can to hashing out thoughts and putting down code per my ability.  Bringing the discussion to the less initiated can have its benefits.  I can see why it's easy to be a bit pissed off about it though, since open source should inevitably rely on the merit of things and not the politics of them.  Bitcoin is full of every problem you could want to solve.
@_date: 2015-05-12 07:36:49
True, I have adjusted my thinking about it a bit.  Originally it was based on mainly that a miner has a stake in wasting other miner's times.  The ideal path for a new block to follow is to the nodes with the lowest hash rate weight on the network through to highest to optimize how much time other miners waste mining on top of the old block.  But you have to consider the chance of losing a block due to not getting it to the center of the network more quickly as well.  It's the miner's dilemma.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:07:47
That's a .3% increase on the next block only for a block creator with 30% marketshare.  If there were another miner across the network with 30% share of the network as well, then they'd receive the same 'temporary' benefit when they discovered a block.

Thanks for this.  I ended up making a somewhat similar suggestion in another thread based on previous block sizes within a range set at each difficulty adjustment as well.  I really like this extra difficulty idea as well.  Time to join the mailing list and get serious about it.

Put a hard cap on the block size at 20 MB.  Make the block size max the average of block sizes over the last 2016 blocks (update with difficulty) times some emptiness ratio (1.3).  Start it at 1 MB and see what happens.  This gives us time to collect data and develop a more formal system for retargeting the block size.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:47:29
Gavin's sense of urgency is heightened because that's his job.  Save for the exposure of some unknown exploit, there shouldn't ever really be a need to fork quickly.  If there was though, it could happen 'quickly' if the code is already there to be pushed.  Developing the code and then trying to break it through any means possible by regression testing is what takes the most time.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:15:52
I'm not positive, but I believe there are.  As far as bitcoin goes, we could probably hold block times at one value for a long time and still scale quite nicely.  But this gives us some diminishing returns on hash rate added.  I think a target block time of zero, a target block size of infinity, and a target block retargeting rate of 1 block is the unachievable dream.  We can get close one day, maybe.
@_date: 2015-05-12 06:46:08
My bet is entirely on the market.  But how are we describing that market?  A 1MB static limit is like saying, 'Apple would rather sell x iPhones every year at increased price' or 'Google would rather milk x users for increasing revenue per year' and yet we know both companies are incredibly user-base hungry.  So the next logical step is to look at tx fees to scale the block chain.  But what values even only considered relative to themselves are appropriate for an increase?  
*We* know what size miners are willing to assemble blocks at and how fast they're assembling them against a difficulty.  It's all *we* need beyond what we decided to set our threshold for risk at a long time ago (and even that can change, hell it could be made more conservative!). The miners know more about their predicament and will need to be deferred to.  We can give them all the help they need to not screw themselves without having to punish those trying to increase the capability of the network indiscriminately.  Part of increasing that capacity is increasing its spatial footprint.
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:15:20
There are multiple ways to scale a database, yes.  Eventually, the overhead of managing the data across multiple 'cheap' systems starts to translate into a better return on scaling those 'cheap' systems.  There is no silver bullet to scaling anything.  It's just iteration cost-benefit iteration cost-benefit.  I don't mean to imply that scaling the blocksize IS scaling the network.  I'm simply saying that it will be necessary for the network to scale.  And 20 MB is a good value.  In the time we've been discussing it, it's already become less of a barrier to entry.  You can see in my comment history I've recommended using a 20 MB hard cap AND a dynamic scaling using a weighted average (starting at 1 MB).  So the only thing we disagree on is apparently how 'dramatic' Gavin is being about things, which I just don't see.

You're looking at [whisper]( for that kind of communication which is where I think I'm headed with this.

If most of the miners adopt XT and start creating larger blocks than Core allows, it means the end of Core.

@_date: 2015-05-09 00:24:08
The more I think about it, the more it looks exactly like the hash rate retargeting problem.  We target an ideal block emptiness (30%?), and update at the same block as the difficulty.  Miners can engage through a tug of war that makes sense in terms of incentives.  Miners compute their ideal block size within the current bounds (min, somewhere in between, max) by comparing their block processing burden as a percentage of block discovery time to whatever ideal they have in mind.  Miners working in their own self interest will always want to 'vote' for this value with their solved blocks.  You still do better with better bandwidth, but is that something that can be avoided?
This basically lets us set the minimum transaction fee of any given set of transactions in the pool too (not hard codeable, but it makes price discovery less binary - transaction succeeds or not - by allowing us to look at miner hash rate share and predict the average minimum block reward for miners).

It moves the block size up or down.  I left out the equation because it could be inferred.  Every 2016 blocks, block size = 1.3 * (avg block size over past 2016 blocks).  You could weight it if you wanted such that blocks closer to the max block size count for less.  The main thing is developing toward a proof that miners working toward their own self interest can do that without getting screwed entirely.

Window size would be based on the sizes of some N previous blocks.  Transaction queue shouldn't matter if that's what you mean, then agreed.  It would be deterministic using previous block sizes. When 2 chains emerge it gets settled the same way as always - longest chain wins. The trick is coming up with the right weighting so that the relationship between 'honest' but IO bound miners (those submitting smaller blocks) is on par in the window tug of war with dishonest bandwidth rich miners.

Block propagation time reduces effective hash rate.  Time spent between when a block is discovered and when you know about it and have validated it implies lost hashes on a stale block.  I thought Gavin explained that quite well here.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:11:45
Interesting thought, but what is a 'high' txn fee?  And if you let miners place them beyond the limit, then what is the limit?  I don't know if we can assume anything about txn fees to solve this problem.  At most we could look at txn fee as a percentage of total transaction output (to answer my own question I guess), but what percentages matter?  I think it's better to think about demand in terms of recentish transactions (as represented by recentlyish solved blocks) and adjust supply (txn space as you stated) as a function of that.  This lets miners 'control' supply by measuring how they honor demand without having to start thinking about the absolute or relative value of fees.  As long as a single miner's control of the block size relative to their control of the hash rate is the same, then all we have to do is worry about mining decentralization just like before.

The question is can you really maximize both at the same time?  Can you decrease your ~~stales~~ orphans while increasing the cost of a full node such that your net hash power grows?  The more it costs other nodes to deal with your blocks, the less likely they are to propagate.  If you and your friends can handle it all, but the other sides of the network can't, then you'll either reduce the network (which works against the demand you feed off of), or have to scale back.
Edit: Criss-crossed some terminology, will fix the argument.

My statement isn't exclusive to Coinbase reward payments.  By OP's logic, 1 BTC across 10 UTXO is different money than 1 BTC from 1 UTXO because the transaction size is larger and thus potentially more expensive for the former case.  Obviously their definition of fungibility is flawed.

I would vote in favor of a 20 MB hard cap and dynamic limits based on the past 2016 blocks, starting at 1 MB.  Take the average, maybe weight the higher blocks a little bit lower than their actual value in that average, multiply that average by some emptiness value (30% maybe?) and see how fast it grows (until it hits 20MB).  I think that would buy us two years AND give us great data.
Ultimately I think the solution is dynamic limits.  And that that solution involves showing miners how to maximize their returns over some time by adjusting their block size accordingly.  It doesn't really protect non-mining nodes, but miners still care about those guys because they help cement their blocks in the block chain.  I'm fairly confident we'll arrive at a situation that involves rescaling the blocksize every 'x' blocks, with some solid math showing miners how to 'defend' themselves from the resource rich miners (maximize their returns over some time value given their own resources, their own perspective of the network, and the state of the blockchain), and a method that allows zero hash rate nodes to communicate about block validation times so that they can apply pressure on block size as well.

You don't actually highlight any assumptions.  I narrow the scope to what is pretty explicit about Bitcoin.  I don't know what is meant by correctly understanding the opportunity cost because it's flat out impossible to do so.  The scenarios I preface with 'for all we know' consider both extremes of the block size to show this.  If Africa's best kept secret is that it has the best internet in the world, it's entirely irrelevant to what I'm saying.  For all I know, it does, and yet reducing the block size is still some impetus to get world wide adoption regardless of transaction fees.  For all I know, everyone sells their kidney to pay to own one Bitcoin tomorrow.  
Within the context of Bitcoin client development, it's all irrelevant.  Stop setting the price in terms of adoption and exchange.  The value of 1 BTC, for any 1 BTC is &gt;= 1/21,000,000th of the Bitcoin economy for any time t, yesterday to the end of the earth.  That is the only conversion rate that matters.  Developing to that requirement makes decisions about parameters actually possible.  If the price of 1 BTC becomes 1 cent tomorrow and that causes you to deem it a failure, then that's unfortunate.  That would sound to me like you were in it for the dollar and not the Bitcoin in the first place. If we believe in the market, then we believe the price of something ULTIMATELY follows the value of something, and not the other way around.
If you don't think that's valuable, then check how any other currency fares against itself over time. 
The USD has widespread adoption.  Why does it keep going down in price?  Because it's less valuable over time.    Adoption isn't the right thing to chase.  It's far too expensive to prioritize.

Block size cap exists as a function of users' ability to audit the block chain.  Higher block size cap, higher chance that users can't do that.

In the beginning, administrators and authorized lists will still be necessary, but the audit-ability provided by the blockchain could conceivably be worth the trouble.  It's not fraud proof, and it basically adds up to a private blockchain, but the abstraction of the blockchain might be right for this kind of record keeping.
Or start smaller.  It'd be pretty sweet to have a city council or state legislature votes recorded on the blockchain. Or even congress. Each vote is a block, whoever runs the floor can record votes by proxy, or maybe individuals can.  Handling keys still requires centralization, but it's a step towards automated transparency.
As far as distribution online in a decentralized way, it's a ways off.  With a reputation system built around keys, it becomes more imaginable.  I'm sure there's a spectrum regarding public central authority vs trustless decentralized authority that we can slowly slide toward the latter on as we start to understand the technology better.

most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
It seems like Satoshi thought eliminating trust was rather crucial there.  Core's roadmap is the only roadmap that is trying to guarantee trustlessness.  Censorability relies on it being too difficult to censor i.e. ubiquitous nodes.  Scarcity relies on it being too difficult to change.  Classic effectively makes it harder to run a node by changing consensus code.

Diff blocks add more overhead to mining at the benefit of several qualities that other nodes should like.  I suppose orphan rates should be lower for miners producing diff blocks, assuming at first at least a naive implementation that prefers main blocks composed of a higher amount of diff blocks.  The extra overhead of updating miners about each diff block should theoretically cut into pool margins as well, which I think is desirable for mining decentralization.  Is the expectation that miners will mine on top of each other's diff blocks?
@_date: 2016-03-24 18:12:39
Right.  That has nothing to do with your first statement, that bitcoins on a sidechain are potentially infungible with bitcoins on mainnet or another sidechain. 1/100th of a bitcoin isn't to 1 bitcoin what 1 penny is to one dollar.  Pennies have to be exchanged.  The reason nobody is scared about holding pennies in the US is because the US government enforces the exchange rate.  I don't believe your local market can even legally refuse a penny as payment, and even if it could, no bank can.  If you want to argue $10,000 in pennies are a huge pain in the ass compared to $100 bills, then fine, but that's liquidity.
If I transfer to a sidechain where I then exchange 1 bitcoin for 100 bitcoin pennies, then, yes, bitcoin pennies aren't bitcoin.  People being stupid with what they exchange bitcoins for isn't a break in fungibility.

I've used the model in my head that it's banking done the 'bitcoin way'.  It helps to keep in mind that the utility of money isn't free, and banknotes helped solve the problems of other forms of money before them in terms of utility (and the market seemed to like it quite a bit) at the cost banking.  LN gives us all of that bank note IOU utility goodness without having to defer to anyone or anything but the blockchain, all at the reasonable cost of payment processors.  
Since it's all really in the same spirit - you have an asset (bitcoin, gold) that you'd like to exchange more rapidly than the asset's characteristics make cheap (TX fees, carrying around gold) and you can do it by depositing that asset with me in exchange for notes (subsequent time-locked transactions, banknotes) - then it's a bit like banking I suppose.  The reason it's good to have LN with faster/cheaper transactions is it allows for earlier settlements either way.  Combine the two together and Bitcoin starts scaling to the level it needs to - which is orders of magnitude more transactions per second than even the highest estimates of today of all monetary transactions combined.  Or not, some people want it to stay a potential reserve asset, but things that can scale tend to, and it's looking like larger blocks won't cost enough in terms of security to stall them anyway.

I pay for an atomic swap between my coins on a sidechain to a payee on a different chain.  The payee doesn't have to know or care what sidechain my coins are on, or how much I'm paying in fees, just as in the case of paying a higher fee because of a larger transaction due to multiple inputs.  They get their coins.
If there isn't a market for for an atomic swap, or it's a prohibitively bad market, it's no different a kind of circumstance than having coins spread over a prohibitively large number of UTXOs; both problems are *your* problem independent of the expectation of a payee.  Having to worry about market circumstances regarding fees given your state of bitcoins isn't a fungibility problem, it's a liquidity problem.  The two are not the same.  "Friction" != infungibility. 
You wouldn't say that someone who can't afford to pay a transaction fee to send one bitcoin doesn't have one bitcoin if their UTXO's contained a balance of exactly one bitcoin.

You do know that with sidechains, you can have a limitless block size client that miners could opt to merge mine if they thought that was in their interest, right?  That Blockstream's primary product guarantees the market can select block size beyond the Core reference implementation, and everyone can choose to run that client as well, right?  If Classic was about scaling Bitcoin, they'd be lobbying for the opcodes that allow a 2 way peg and working on the politics of bootstrapping miners to merge mine a 2MB implementation that they can fork instead for future block size increases.

I hear a lot about economics in the debate.  Mostly what is meant by 'good' economics is the positioning of Bitcoin so that the 'price increases' -&gt; 'demand for bitcoins increases' feedback loop gets more intense.  The economics of block size cannot be simpler.  Supply and demand.  It's irrelevant to the discussion of whether Bitcoin can be sustained on whatever blocksize, and how best to scale Bitcoin long-term.  If x users use y blockspace then z users will abandon yadda yadda isn't 'pro market economics'.  It's pro socializing costs and not letting the market select the price of a commodity that is a function of far more than how much of it you want.

Vaporware was a serious problem 26 years ago apparently.  Not so much today and not at all in the Bitcoin space.  LN and Sidechains exist in implementation.  And anybody worth anything on the discussion of Bitcoin engineering and scaling can see both the obstacles (political and technological) of consumer-grade implemntations, and that on the quesiton of how best to scale Bitcoin, they are deeply embedded in that future.  I can say that without even discounting the idea that a block size increase is desirable or not.  They're simply that 'figured out' and good.

My list is ordered correctly assuming Metcalfe's law.  It just assumes that your preexisting position in the network will be easy to leverage as the market grows because the ability to serve the network will grow asymmetrically in the short term in a way that favors that position.  But in the long term, local providers edge out foreign ones.  Less share can still be more reward in the long term because the net utility/value/reward of the network grows exponentially with participants.  We value decentralization precisely because of its ability to scale.  You are right, I have some things to define and clarify.  And 'physical' distance is only correlative with distance in a computer-based network, so I'd remove the word physical from my previous post because you're right, latency just isn't that big a deal in Bitcoin because it doesn't really affect throughout and propagation times which are the more important for metrics of 'distance'.

User base really is the crux.  You need it to grow to start successfully scaling things like Lightning Networks anyway.  I think you could just double or triple the limit now and buy a couple of years though.  20 MB is about more than just keeping the ship afloat.  It's a high enough limit for us to be able to observe the economics of the network versus spam without block limits.  Self-regulation without a block limit is where we really want to go, and we can't miss the opportunity to test that out.  That's what triggers my sense of urgency about 20 MB at least.

@_date: 2016-01-16 00:52:30
This is what I don't understand.  Sidechains and Lightning solve all of the problems that are supposedly 'already' causing Bitcoin's destruction.
From Mike's "farewell": 


I know of two ways to solve this problem: One includes making the block size so large that a transaction gets included based solely on the merit that it can make its way into a miner's mempool.  The external costs are massive.  The other way is routing transactions through payment channels that have none of the downsides, and quite a few more upsides in terms of privacy and scalability.
Then there's the fact that sidechains enable you to build whatever the hell you want and attach it to Bitcoin.  You might not gain any traction from miners, but that's the market.  Maybe your federated peg with whitelisted block creators and ten billion transactions per second becomes the defacto way to transfer Bitcoins.  Great.  If everyone is preaching about 'alternative clients' and 'let the market decide' and 'bitcoin needs to scale to VISA levels', the best solutions to all of these things already exist in theory and quite a lot in testing implementation, and pretty much none of the noise from Hearncoats includes any of them.

Why does inflation happen to every currency on the planet then?  Widespread knowledge of fractional reserve's existence is a relatively recent phenomenon that most still do not understand, despite it being a long-standing practice.  The scenario that allows for the highest probability of Bitcoin maintaining finite supply is if every member of its economy runs a node to enforce it.  Developing to that requirement is the most sensical way to maximize the probability of that outcome.  Trusting in some subset of all actors to maintain a requirement for all actors is not.

@_date: 2015-05-27 23:06:03
That's why I argue the emptiness factor.  You're right though, even as a short term solution it doesn't work because people could just spam transactions.  My logic is: In the long term, miners won't just want to fill up the block because there will be a better way to maximize returns than just including every transaction with a fee (scarcity).  There will be some sweet spot for each individual miner, where they are both 'voting' on the maximum with their solutions that protect them over time, and including the maximum of the transaction fees in the pool based on that sweet spot (block size).  Until that is made known to miners, where they can be shown how to maximize their return over some time period given the state of themselves and the network, then dynamic limits will just be subject to low cost spam (that spam still does have a cost though).  
It would still be interesting to see though.  If we just let miners be naive and include every transaction, then we'd get a picture of the effects of increasing demand on the network.  It's ultimately a bet that people won't want to spend money on spamming transactions.  I guess one less naive approach for miners would be to not include zero fees.  We don't have to enforce that network wide, someone could incentivize miners a different way to include zero fees still, but miners could adjust their tx fees.

Non negligible TX fee rewards make this harder a case to prove.  The more likely scenario is that smaller miners mine as many TX fees as is near-term maximal, since amortizing the opportunity cost of forgoing them to protect their position on block size is difficult to to provide for on quarterlies.  Businesses have to set terms for metrics.  You will never be able to adjust for the external costs of defending the block size correctly.

Here's what you don't understand: Core (a long list of people who built Bitcoin) is full of cypherpunks - people that believe that personal sovereignty through information privacy and economic autonomy is a priority.  The form AND content of the hardfork reeks of complete ambivalence, if not malevolence, toward this priority.  Core's roadmap for achieving scale with Bitcoin is built on not just the desire to maintain this principle of personal sovereignty, but on the conclusion that Bitcoin's growth positively affirms the long term economic viability of systems that allow for such sovereignty.  They are long on their ideals, and they are long on Bitcoin.  If you take this into consideration, Bitcoin *does not scale*.  That the price is high, and adoption is high, has nothing to do with what makes Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was not built to be valuable.  It was built to be Bitcoin.  You cannot separate its current speculative value from the incredibly conservative values that inform its creation and adoption.
You are indeed correct, that in a mature ecosystem with sidechains and payment channels, the block size acts as a rising tide to lift all boats.  The bigger priority is to make sure that experimenting with water levels happens elsewhere, and if the water level for everyone (Bitcoin's block size) is to rise, that it do so in a 100% safe way that does not undermine what makes Bitcoin truly valuable - it's ability to be an unregulated currency that anyone can interact with without needing to trust a single person or entity.

The cost to the ecosystem is relative to the miner's scale.  A larger position in a smaller market is often near-term more profitable than a smaller position in a larger one.  We're getting *better* at amortizing ecosystem support costs over non-discrete timelines, but there's no guarantee.  My example would be any and all currencies up to Bitcoin.  They always fall over because entities with discretion over their policies direct them in self-maximizing ways that breed external costs to their ecosystem that cannot be settled beyond collapse.

It's hard to imagine that kind of scale with only 3 miners.

Incentives to exclude fee paying transactions to artificially reduce supply of the blockspace commons do not counteract the incentives to artificially increase supply of the blockspace commons at each step.

Disclaimer: this is crap, but it was helpful to try and work out this bastardized analogy regardless of what a failure it turned out to be. 
Nodes = people running the bitcoin client such as miners, bitcoin related businesses, awesome people that just want to, or awesome people that want to deal with the network directly and not rely on anybody else to tell them about it for plenty of reasons.
Nodes are required to keep bitcoin decentralized because they all talk to each other about what is happening on the network.  Every point of discussion is a transaction, and every conversation goes:






More or less anyway. Nodes want to hear about every transaction they can so they can tell every node they can about them so that those nodes will think they're interesting enough to keep them further updated because they've got some stake in bitcoin for the reasons stated above.
Most transactions discussed are those submitted between the time of 'currently' and 'recently', with the occasional new node showing up needing to be told everything (and he asks lots of different nodes about the history of all transactions and makes sure to check the story for inconsistencies but how he's brought online isn't really critical to this discussion because the majority of chit chat doesn't involve the newcomers getting up to speed anyway).
Meanwhile, nodes that choose to try **really hard** (mining)  to summarize (create a block) everything they hear in such a perfect way that we can all agree to just stack up all these transactions and paperclip that summary to it because we've all got this weird way of just totally agreeing on whether a summary is perfect or not.  We'll give the node that submitted the summary some BTC for their efforts and to include all the transaction fees with that and start talking about some more transactions until another summary happens.  Anybody can submit a summary to other nodes any time they want, and other nodes are all perfect graders and can immediately give the summary a passing or failing grade.  If it passes, we're all going to keep that summary around and agree it's the perfect slice of our history between what just happened and what will happen next.  We raise the bar every once and a while so that summaries tend to be written every 10 minutes.
Right now there's a limit on how many transactions can be summarized at one time.  If you increase that limit, nodes will take longer to tell each other about the latest summary (since every transaction has to be listed with the summary).  Since anyone can make up a summary, anyone could start spouting bullshit constantly and we'd all still have to listen to the whole thing before we could pass or fail it.  That gives people who can listen to more crap at once (have more bandwidth) an advantage over those who can't, because they can move forward with the 'real' story and leave other summary writers out of the loop.
What it means for the future of bitcoin is that we'll come to some happy medium about how long a summary should be before I know to stop caring and things will progress just fine.  If people stop making summaries, we might have to lower the bar, so we want to make it easy for them to hear everything and sum it up or else the story starts to get so easy to write that almost anybody could convince me theirs is the right one.  And bitcoin only works because we agree on the same story of transactions, and it's secure because writing them just keeps getting harder and harder to do, and we want to keep it that way, but it involves regulating the chit chat

Yeah sorry, we all know what you're saying.  Your whole argument is just so absurd that there's really no point in refuting 'why' the promise changed.  It was never there.  I remember when people told me bitcoin was and always would be the 'cheapest' way to transact online.  They weren't Gavin, or Satoshi, or Core, or anyone who actually knew how Bitcoin worked.  They were Coinbase and other startups that, in the short or long, were leveraging the current transaction fee.  Many of them mistakenly assumed it would always be that way, or that they could (as they try) to make it that way.  Unfortunately, people like me, who run nodes, don't want it to be that way, and entitled assholes who think promises made by nobody should be kept by people that don't even agree with them.
And the stupidest fucking part of it is, that bitcoin will indeed become the cheapest way to transact by the nature of its architecture, and we know HOW for the most part, and we know that the assholes who want to do it the wrong way are constantly using this 'why has the promise changed' argument to replace a working governance with a more "business friendly" one.

You're absolutely right.  But since Bitcoin isn't a business, we should probably prioritize one over the other.  Bitcoin's spec is incredibly narrow compared to 'correctly understanding the opportunity cost of not scaling robustly already' or whatever the hell that's referring to.  For all we know, in the year 2029, Bitcoin's price is 100% higher in the case that the block size was reduced tomorrow rather than increased tomorrow because more residents of developing nations quickly used it to hedge against their own local currencies because nodes became feasibly operable on their hardware and internet connections.  Maybe after a global economic downturn, Bitcoin hit a huge increase in demand as a sturdy hedge against their weaker currencies.  Or, maybe if we just completely remove the block size, Bitcoin subsumes the entire world economy in two years.
The point is, why you would do either isn't about 'hitting the adoption curve' or making you a single cent.  Bitcoin's spec is:
1.  Be money that is uncensorable/completely fungible/inherently not subject to the problems of compliance and mediation of today's banking system unless end-users (including business) wish to be so.  We use the word decentralized to describe this.
2. Be finite supply.  This is your incentive to adopt.  1 bitcoin today = 1 bitcoin tomorrow = 1 bitcoin 1 trillion years from now.
Ever wonder why everyone's in a big hurry to be fast on the adoption curve, hit it big and cash out?  Because their money fucking sucks.  They always need more of it.  That kind of thinking will only give you that kind of money.

Transaction routing will eventually just be traffic routing.  Got an antenna and some bitcoin?  Then you have the internet.  Data at the very edges of the network will 'permeate' towards the center.  Big backbones might still haul data using IP, but a pseudonym based address layer is looking more and more likely (built on top of IP at first and then eventually natively supported).  Forward traffic with your home connection to earn credit for your mobile devices.  If your home location doesn't let you do that, then you just buy some BTC and you can connect.  Or in the case of 21, let your devices at home convert electricity into BTC.

Collusion.  Try to maximize the network distance between you and smaller miners and minimize that distance between your partner miners and the rest of the network.  Practically, try to keep them off the relay network, and keep your nodes in the same Datacenter as your friends and other large economic entities like exchanges.  Block size will always set an upper bound on the effectiveness of this strategy.  Keeping it as small as practically possible will increase the probability that the cost of colluding is prohibitive.

What if we could determine block time and block size from the capabilities of the network? I've been thinking of block size lately, and it required me to start thinking in about bitcoin's ideals. Equal effective hash rate between all nodes on the network being one such 'ideal'. But effective hash rate is a function of network topology as well. If we treat hash rate the same at time t (= time from last solved block), then we're really saying that every node is equidistant from every other node in terms of propagation time. Propagation time is a function of block size and transfer rate. So we know the topology of our ideal. Thankfully that topology isn't required for acceptable security and an acceptable block size (as block size relates to distance between nodes). I need to look at how difficulty and block times can be used to describe security to finish this thought. But I think we have the means to describe a given topology in terms of its security and thus its maximum block size (among other things). And in our ideal, any two sets of nodes of equal size have an equal sum effective hash rate. So can nodes tell enough about where they are given what they know about their neighbors and the state of the blockchain such that they can behave to guarantee an acceptable security and (and thus block size capability)? So far we know that a node maximizing its own hash rate is a good way to behave (we reward it at least). A node also wants to maximize profit from its TX fees as well, which means it wants to maximize its block size as transaction demand increases as well.
In an ideal world, block time = 0, and block size = infinity. Bitcoin can verify with 100% certainty the validity of any demand for transactions instantly (with no trusted third party of course!). Can an individual node know enough about itself, its neighbors, and the network from solved blocks for the network to target itself toward a minimum block time and maximum block size while maintaining a specific acceptable threshold of security? If it's possible, then isn't that what bitcoin is? The maximally ideal version of its network that can be achieved by the capability of its network?

This is such horseshit.  The argument that there are "social issues" hinges on the imperative of a block size increase; that there would be a 'simple' fix to the problem if not for structural problems in the community.  The stewards of the protocol and client development do not agree that the imperative exists, AND that the proposed solution would not be simple at all, that it is instead incredibly risky.
Now we're just stuck in a loop of circular reasoning, and you have to applaud Mike for it, especially since his farewell does nothing to convince against that this was his plan all along.  "Bitcoin has social issues because it can't fix a problem it must, therefore Bitcoin can't fix a problem it must because it has social issues".  It's exactly the lowest-common-denominator crap that Cohen is referencing, and it routes us backwards from finding the actual solutions to a technical problem to investigating how Bitcoin development is somehow now (despite it not being so a year ago with the exact same actors) corrupt.

I'm for a raisable block size.  However, we do it just needs to honor the existence of spam, the incentives of miners with more bandwidth to increase the block size, and the supply and demand mechanics already underlying transactions.  We shouldn't make transactions *arbitrarily* scarce, on that point I agree, but we like miners because they secure the blockchain, so it's all about managing their incentives to do that.  Scarcity will always be a factor.

If you want to enable more block space, run a Classic node.  I run a Core node and think Classic is a joke, but you can do whatever you want with the resources you have.  


Nobody is claiming 1 MB is a magical number.  Satoshi set it when it became apparent that Bitcoin was susceptible to a fairly low cost attack that could dismember the entire network.  No convincing science has developed to say that more is necessary according to the market.


There are certainly proponents for this, but what keeps that argument from breaking out really requires discussing:


The very idea that there is a perfect block size is suspect.  The science of blockchain based networks is brand new.  There have been attempts at diving a perfect block size, falling below, at, or above this limit.  It will be a while, I believe, before we can say what it is, if there is one, or prove why there could never be a perfect block size.
1 MB simply has a lot of inertia.  It turned out to be a enough runway to develop better thinking about scaling.  Since then, it has become what a lot of people consider to be a useful constraint in bringing about longer term scaling solutions.
Personally, I think people are way too willy nilly with the idea of finite supply money.  We have to remember that Bitcoin is only at best *probably* finite supply.  Solutions that increase that probability should always take priority.  Shrinking it (be it directly or through maintaining a constant requirement against increasing technological advances) is far and away our best means of doing so currently.

There are a thousand dimensions to the block size debate, but international implications are going to map to decentralization concerns pretty directly - it doesn't do us any good to have people hop on en masse only for it to turn out to be a centralized system.


If thats true, we can't afford as a civilization to make bitcoin a swiss army knife.
When the 'gold parity' feature of the US dollar was removed, it was quickly replaced with the 'oil purchasability' feature (in what we know as the petrodollar deal).  It was a pretty successful feature from the perspective of the US; it made the currency stronger (from US perspective) by basically forcing people to have to hold it.
So the stability of bitcoin comes before the swiss army knife features, but bitcoin's health depends on those extra features too if we want people to 'have' to adopt it.

Lightning is not the only means to scaling.  A two way peg to a merge mined sidechain with a bigger block size is entirely possible.  Miners and exchanges would do well to develop this, rather than sinking millions into contentious hard fork attempts.  They have all the right tools to balance liquidity on both chains and to make tons of money doing so.  As more sidechains proliferate, the market selects which solutions are workable by punishing bad bets.
From there you get cross-chain lightning, atomic swaps, etc.  These are the market solutions to the problem.  The reason people think 1 MB is fine is because when you're talking about millions, billions, even trillions of transactions per second, all of which I expect to see in my lifetime, the main chain transaction throughput just doesn't really matter.  Then, when you're talking about fragility, decentralization, geopolitical posturing, the history of money, why all monies fail, then 1 MB seems like a nice place to stop.
The only things I know for sure are: 1 MB works, and thus far, without a good framework for understanding the construct of the blockchain (like how we understand Context Free Grammars or The Prisoner's Dilemma), the only thing we can base the block size on is empirical evidence.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:39:53
This is the part that I struggle with with the 1 MB or less crowd.  People need reasons to run nodes.  Using the reduction in nodes as evidence that block size = centralization is ludacris too when you remember that for the first few years, Bitcoin Core was the best/only way to interact with Bitcoin.  You don't need to run a full node to do that anymore.
And if we end up with a protocol stack where bitcoin is the base settlement layer only accepting 1 MB blocks, then are people actually going run full nodes en masse?  I think that camp would argue everyone will be using Lightning Network transactions (believable) and that they'll all also be acting as nodes that forward transactions in that network (less believable).  With 1 MB pushing everything else that can be done with bitcoin downstream, I think we end up with a really light full node that nobody has any real reason to run anyway, since their smart property and other crazy use-cases will largely be settled by a different layer and only require SPV for bitcoin.
In terms of consumers vs producers and a taller bitcoin stack, DNS hierarchy looks more promising.  Of course we all want decentralization, and there aren't any convincing arguments to say the market would correct a small cohort of 'root nodes' from toppling that, but keeping a full node lightweight doesn't seem to guarantee anything in terms of decentralization either.  It just pushes the weight up the stack.

There are definitely people that want to keep blocks at (or below) 1 MB.  I'm hopeful we'll find a better scaling method than XT's, and the hard fork deployment strategy is certainly not ideal, but with 8 MB, we get to see how the economy actually handles larger blocks without removing access to the block chain for smaller entities entirely.  
I'm just tired of the FUD.  Is 8 MB ideal?  Nope.  Is doubling every once and a while ideal?  Probably not.  Do we know what the ideal is? Not yet, maybe someday.  Can the network handle this change without breaking? Yes.  Do we have to hard fork?  Not *yet*, but when will we get consensus from the Core devs?  Maybe never.

If bitcoin turns out to be a reliable store of value, it will eventually sit upstream of all other currencies anyway due to its 'finite' supply (these things are determined by consensus and we can't be positive that consensus won't dictate the coinbase reward continue in the future even if I am hopeful it doesn't), and its fungibility / ease of transfer.  But it would be nice if transacting in bitcoin, no matter the layer, gets cheaper over time as well.  
Bitcoin doesn't have violence on its end, so we pretty much have to bank on just obscene utility to make it a world power of its own.  One such utility is a reliable, uninflatable store of value.  The 'Bitcoin 2.0' stuff is just as exciting though.

If blocks stay uber small, nobody is going to run nodes anyway.  The logic is just astounding (and makes me paranoid as fuck about what's driving it).  Even if everyone is using Lightning, they will just SPV from trusted service providers for the most part.  Most people want iPads, not desktops.  Most people don't opt for 2FA when their bank gives it to them.  They're not going to run full nodes if it means better security for themselves and the ecosystem when they can just use a service that has no economic incentive to lie to them.  And keeping the blockchain small guarantees pretty much no use-case where there's an absolute reason to run a full node - everything will be pushed downstream.  It will just be the same problem at another layer.
"But censorship" ... again, just because people could maintain a decentralized network on cheap hardware, doesn't mean they're going to.  We broke the union by shopping at Wal-Mart.  If you can make it cheaper, we'll use it instead.  Nobody's going to double back for altruism.

I defined them explicitly.  The critical properties are fungibility and a lack of trust of a 3rd party (trustlessness, local auditability).  The more expensive it is to run a node, the higher the risk that you lose these.  Blacklisting, impossibility to validate your own blockchain, KYC, AML.  Avoiding that is Bitcoin.   
The internet of commerce?  Merchants?  Electronic cash?  Are you sure you aren't looking for the US Dollar?  Or Yuan?  Or Euro?  Merchants accept them.  All across the internet.  And the vast majority of them exist entirely in digital form.  You may want to spend some time figuring out the difference between bitcoins and dollars and see if bitcoin really is for you.  Why is bitcoin fixed supply?  Why is the dollar not?  Didn't the dollar used to be pegged to gold?  Why isn't it now?  Why can't I accept your credit card directly without having to ask permission from an authorized payment processor?  What does this mean about what I can practically sell to you?  Who controls the supply of the dollar?  What is their policy?  These are questions you need to know the answer to.
There's nothing about a transaction fee market that invalidates the electronic cash use case of bitcoin.  You just don't like how much it might cost in the interim.  If bitcoins are just cheaper to use alternatives to existing currencies to you, then you're assuming a lot of risk for very little reward.


People saw value in the token because it does what no other token can because it has properties that no other token has (see above).  The market can do whatever it wants with the conversion rate of bitcoin.  People mined when it couldn't buy a dollar.  Why is the price of a bitcoin in dollars suddenly so important?


Won what?  Being the cheapest way to buy stuff on the internet?  Trustlessness -&gt; Permissionless innovation -&gt; innovation and efficiency.  You can't traverse backwards.  You seem to be confused about whether you're a part of a revolution or just trying to make big bucks off bitcoins.  Because supporting users today at the cost of what actually makes the token valuable is a short game.

Because the leading figures of Core would no longer have a Bitcoin to develop.  From their perspective, XT/Classic style hard forks define a new coin that is not Bitcoin while simultaneously ending Bitcoin.

There are even products leveraging Linux where *the end user is the primary concern*.

There's a reason Ethereum's consensus is built the way it is.  These systems aren't looking to be the end-all-be-all of objectivity that Bitcoin is.

The point was not to make the cheapest way to purchase things online.  Find that in the white paper please.  The point was to have a system of transferable value independent of any trusted third party.  That entails the properties I have discussed.  Block size is incredibly important in maintaining those properties.  Wider adoption is not worth undermining these properties.  The value decreases in the long-term if these properties are not maintained.  
You're talking to someone who has invested thousands of dollars and who would not 'sell' a bitcoin for his cat.  Who spends their free time working through the protocol to hopefully develop against it.  I am incredibly long, and I promise you that if node count decreases to make the  number go up in the short term, that I won't be able to buy Friskies with my bitcoins in 10 years because it will devolve into yet another shitty database coin subject to the will of the assholes that already run the others.

That's entirely possible, yeah.  I said waiting to HF makes HFing in the future much more difficult (assuming Bitcoin's adoption in more disparate markets).  The thing I also left out is... What stops someone from just ignoring the GPL license?  We know it's illegal, but we know some laws are more strictly followed than others.  Ultimately it's peer pressure. (That it's written that domestic and international courts can levy fines and prison sentences is not the guarantee that they will).  There's no guarantee to stop a HF.  There's no guarantee for the first amendment either.  Why we choose to consistently enforce these conventions in the real world is for a multitude of reasons spanning from market to ideological.  I'd argue that any successful coup on FOSS or Bitcoin that undermines their respective inspiring ideals will ultimately lead to a failure for the new order anyway - an inferior product.  I won't say that Classic is a coup outright, but I think it, in form, works against the principles that make Bitcoin truly valuable.  Trustless -&gt; Locally auditable.  Fungible -&gt; Privacy and the guarantee that coins will always be valid.  I'm not saying Classic means to undermine these things, I'm just trying to explain my aversion to both the HF and the increase, and try to give an impression of what a lot of people think.

If I go above 35 connections with the current 1 MB, the girlfriend's netflix/hulu starts to stutter and I have to hear about it.  Of course, I care about bitcoin, so to maintain those 35 connections, I invested money into overkill on my modem and router.  Trying to maintain any inbound peers on the default crap modem + router combos that practically everyone rents from their ISPs will give you some pretty bad QoS on your LAN as it is. If all you're maintaining is 8 outgoing connections, you'll be alright, if your roommates don't do anything too bandwidth/routing intensive.

Yeah.  Appealing to business sense is silly.  Bitcoin is a stateless, digitally transferable asset with complete fungibility (privacy, censorship-resistance), and local auditability (pre-req of stateless, trustless).  Bitcoin as a critique of money, and the possible subsequent ontological shift about money into something untethered to the will of existing state monopoly capital entities is its value proposition.  That is the scope of the protocol.  That is where its value as an investment, or currency, stems from.  Abstracting money away from state should make the development of both better.  If Bitcoin no longer has the above properties, and some other token does, then either a filter exists (probably in the form of political subdivision) that makes no such token possible, or that token will become more valuable than bitcoin in the long run.
Appealing to existing users is practical, but not if it is at the cost of the original values that created the space in the first place.  The comparison of block size increase to socialism is, I feel, apt.  It's asymmetric.  Trying to solve the N * N problem of Bitcoin while maintaining the above properties is difficult, but not an endorsement of scaling down validators and relying on them to maintain the original value proposition.  This breaks the local auditability quality of Bitcoin, and at some threshold of barrier to entry, the privacy and censorship qualities as well.
Going beyond the scope above to serve business interests is exactly what any given business would want.  That's why these parameters are hard.

Scalability will increasingly become less of a question of block size increases and more a question of how smart contract tech like Lightning, and the sidechains economy evolve.  Scalability will never be a solved problem for the internet or Bitcoin.

But scalability will be traded on for quite a while.  It's actually the beauty of sidechains.

Who said that block size should never be raised?  Again: FORM.  Satoshi didn't have the max block size in his original conception of Bitcoin.  Is it possible that as we develop, we learn things?   That a best guess about how code today might scale tomorrow is very often incorrect?  I suppose rather than conceiving of such a possibility, I'll overlook the notes of tons of people involved in the project for many years and defer to a few words by Satoshi because it makes for a good canned response.

What use cases exactly are shed by maintaining the critical properties of Bitcoin against increasing adoption?  The only one I can think of is far-below-market or free transactions.  


What people have in Bitcoin are bitcoins, chains of scripts and bearer signatures.  "Access" to them cannot be limited by the block size.  If the blocksize were zero, I could exchange bitcoin with you still.  The risk of doing so is just far higher for you than would be practical.  Block space is a commodity that enables risk-minimal transference of bitcoins.  So yes, political will to enact (not just 'listening' about, you can listen to whatever you want) a policy that requires the provision of a commodity to protect against potential risk *for all* (that fees increase, what you call 'access restriction') is (because I never said it was, only that the analogy is apt) a bit like socialism.
And yes, an arbitrarily small block size would produce monopoly.  I said these parameters are hard, not that there is one exact one that I know.  However, keeping the critical properties of bitcoin trumps everything, so an overly conservative approach should be considered.

It'll just be to appease my risk-averse investors. I won't actually not publish my source in the future because that would be wildly unpopular, but I feel more comfortable and I will be more likely to join my capital with the ecosystem if I have the option.

Bitcoin is far more cost effective to build a network around trading in small amounts than gold though.  The tech for gold-as-currency is way too expensive.  Imagine someone handing you fragments of gold.  Verification would require technology that's way harder to make portable than transistor based mechanisms or software for general purpose computing machines.  Digitizing gold transactions and settling balances at-will would require massive physical infrastructure if you want latencies less than months, and securing those transactions seems all but impossible.  It has been tried.
The ability to amortize bitcoin transactions for smaller quantities of bitcoin over time will be easy to realize compared to gold.

If you don't 'put aside' the fact that there was a politically motivated spam attack on the network, then yes, less TXs are a good thing right now **since so many of them were malicious**.
Things you'll realize in time:
1) These arguments have been made for 4 years now, and BTC is worth $4600 still without any adoption of the 'scary full blocks' mentality
2) Transaction throughput is higher than ever.  Bitcoins don't have to be transacted on chain; ask an exchange.

You are way overestimating how well the governments of the EU, China, USA, BRICS are going to take a trillion dollar non-national economy's existence, and way underestimating how fiercely the control of Bitcoin's monetary policy will be pursued as it increases in value.  Nothing can be done to stop Bitcoin if running a node is trivial, and all attempts at leveraging the value of Bitcoin to form more scalable transaction networks can take place safely off the main chain.  Raising the block size is bad engineering and bad economics with FAR superior options available.  There's a reason that a lack of consensus on this has been manufactured.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:23:21
Because transaction malleability was intended.  It's almost as if you have never interacted with the block chain programmatically.

Segwit helps scale because the block weight incentivizes more efficient transactions, but it was created to fix a protocol breaking bug.  Only because a bunch of propagandists were seeding the conversation with BIG BLOCKS LOOMING CRISIS bullshit did it ever get wrapped up in the scaling debate.
At some point there was a lot of talk in r/btc about how SegWit is bad, but it didn't last long because it didn't make a lot of sense and couldn't be parroted by the humans.

That Bitcoin is scarce is the reason people speculate about its value, and that it stays scarce is a function of automated audit by all stakeholders, including end-users.  If you remove automated audit by the end users, you will create incentive for abuse of the monetary supply by entities with better relative proximity to the mint.  Why does every currency get devalued? Because the end-users have next to zero recourse, while the policy makers can create and abuse time-value schedules that the end user will never have access to, thus beating the market on the currency they control, and leaving the losses to the end-user.

If there were enough nodes representing meaningful economic activity of disparate interests, then the market would be the users (of the software).  Nobody runs Bitcoin though.

I would if I hadn't already explained above.  Go ahead and stick with your narrative that you're fighting a 'community' battle on the forums, but it doesn't matter what software that community runs.  
Running a node secures the network from political attacks.  See: The fact that a bunch of dicks trying to fork the network away from FOSS and user sovereignty with BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin 1 have all failed miserably.  It's absolutely amazing that literally every attack has come with node software, and tried to hype node count, and yet you still believe nodes don't matter.  Miners aren't going to mine blocks on top of a fork that they think 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 percent of the network are going to reject.  UASF literally just proved this.  Maybe you just can't understand it because you're convinced everyone actually wants bigger blocks despite everyone with any economic weight rejecting such proposals **by not running software that implement them.**
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:34:17
You're right.  Non-mining nodes just determine what is Bitcoin for the user.  What will ultimately bring people back to the chain that prioritizes nodes is that their coin won't be some worthless pile of shit moderated by committee.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:30:44

The only authority is rational self-interest.  That's why miners don't run the protocol.  The hashing algorithm can be changed if it ever came to that.  They can fork all they want, but, as it literally just happened with SegWit activation and UASF, and as it would happen with 2X if it wasn't already dead in the water, they won't do it if they're not positive it won't cause disruption that causes losses.  Miners != Consensus.

2 MB is not a tiny block size.  Can you justify it without using the word 'probably'?  People are 'entrenched' in their bitcoins, and the soundness of the value of those bitcoins is tied entirely to the reliability of a network with a necessary throughput of an absolute minimum possible N x (blocksize/10 minutes) with ideally low latency to help it survive: an arms race for computing power conducted over it, every possible catastrophic internet vulnerability, uncertainty in every possible political and economic climate, current and future cyber warfare and espionage, government firewalls, current and future legal frameworks.  
Basically add up all the stuff that kills currencies all the time plus all the stuff that makes a network hard to sustain reliably, and then add a bounty for network disruption of the possibility of irrevocable liquid money.
There's a reason that the best engineers in the space are not trying to raise the block size  *more than they already have*.  Raising it more is risky.  It will always be risky.  And not raising it whenever possible provides good incentives for real solutions.
That you dismiss this thinking as 'bullshit' is ridiculous and ignorant.

I have put on presentations describing Bitcoin to technically adept people.  Classes teaching people how to set up bitcoins and helping people recover them are the only thing that I can say are actually nice, definitely pro-Bitcoin actions.  I have never told someone to buy bitcoins though.  That's really fucking mean.  I inform, and I let people decide for themselves.

If you think that it simply doesn't matter what software users run, despite 8 years of Bitcoin history to prove this entirely false, I can't help you.

At what number of nodes is Bitcoin free of moderation by intermediaries and safe from state enforced prohibition, and thus worth anything?  At what number of nodes does rent seeking become feasible as it is with every other currency on the planet?  At what minimum system requirements is Bitcoin no longer trust free or intermediary free for all possible Bitcoin users?  At what block size does the cost of securing the network become externalized and thus the currency subject to regulatory capture?    
Can we scale in a way that allows individuals to inherit the risk of trading security for cost instead of the entire network? Yes.  Can you use a different platform if you want cheap but less secure transactions? Yes.  Is it a bit ironic that the reason you don't want to use a different platform is that Bitcoin's growth over the past 8 years far outstrips the savings after pricing in the friction of moving between Bitcoin and other currencies even if transaction fees are high? Yes.  Are most people clamoring for a block size increase to lower fees on the basis of adoption weak handed, short term oriented? Yes.  Do people with hundreds of bitcoins worth $6,100 each give a fuck about adopting the unsustainable, short sighted agenda of people that came way late to the party? No.  Can you run a node to effect the policy of Bitcoin? Yes.  Do people who actually run nodes want to incorporate some socialist view that transactions  should be cheap if it means offloading the cost of maintaining the network to a few number of actors? No.

I have been saying the same thing.  Fiat requires regulators to function, and regulators are subject to capture.  That's Bitcoin's entire critique of money in a nutshell.  The problem of money soundness is the problem of privileged third parties.
How do we maintain Bitcoin without making it subject to regulators? 
1) Peer review (what proposed modifications work within the framework of Bitcoin's critique)
2) Not allowing maintenance of the money, such as securing the blockchain, to be externalized.
B2X breaks both.

Wow this is laughable.  Regulation, laws, politics.  That a lot of people run nodes is why we don't have bad policy like block size increases already taking place.  Ubiquitous nodes makes it nearly impossible to encourage forking away from the contract already in place due to the massive risk associated with attempting to do so.  Ubiquitous nodes make filtering node traffic or prohibiting some or all use cases of BTC through legislation and violence next to impossible.
And I'll reiterate: There are far better solutions for scalability in terms of engineering and economics than increasing node requirements anyway.

Jesus that's some double-think you did there with SegWit.  Try changing the subsidy and getting a pre-soft fork node to accept it.  That's what auditing means.  Are people minting Bitcoins they shouldn't be? Do the inputs and outputs of transactions add up?  Soft-forks literally cannot break that.

Lightning solves most of the scaling problems for transactions.  Regardless of where the tech is today, if you approach the problem from the opposite direction i. e.  that given a network topology has a blocksize capability while maintaining some threshold of security and decentralization per Satoshi's probability of an attacker being successful (sec. 11 of the white paper), then rapid demand will almost definitely carry with it a larger blocksize.  I'm not saying transactions should be free or even cheap necessarily on the mainchain.  But all those things are doable.

If Comcast could charge extra for access to its customers to companies like Netflix, then either users take on the additional costs through membership fees, or Netflix gets priced into a lower quality of service.  I hate when capitalism is invoked to write off net neutrality.  Seems like it takes a lot of pretending to think Comcast-NBC-Universal doesn't have a set of conflicts of interests here; as if NBC doesn't lose revenue when people stop watching traditional cable, something that it's even hedged against with a stake in a Netflix competitor, Hulu.  What does its Universal Studio subsidiary think about Netflix and other internet content providers getting into the movie game if they want to?  It's an arbitrary barrier to entry set by a company using its customers as leverage to back up the bottom line of its own subsidiaries and to extend the lifetime of its own product: cable television.  
  This is usually when people say municipal and state sponsored monopolies are what caused the problem.  Or talk about things like mesh networking routing around all the bullshit. I say until either of those things are even remotely solved, keep net neutrality alive as the counterbalance to those monopolies set up before and as a equalizer for things like microtransaction supported mesh networks to get off the ground.  I mean jesus fucking christ.  I build cabinets for a living and half of my contracts are auditable by standards boards to protect our consumer and there are plenty of government contracts that require me to interface with trade unions and councils in an attempt to protect labor.

I'll agree about the assessment of the pro-startup mentality by saying that I don't think much of what they do reinforces the idea of reducing the barriers to exit anyway.  It's pure irony to me that Hacker News will link an article about how silicon valley might be changing the world right under an article about the latest company to secure millions of dollars in VC.  I'll take the useful ideas they create and try to do without the other nonsense.  To me, someone who likes to think in terms of what can be made to be socially productive without completely undermining my own political economy (because I can't do shit towards anything if I can't eat), I think 'reducing barriers to exit' isn't a completely useless idea.  It's a decent way of pairing technology with social aims that can give insight into making dissent from the existing structures towards those goals productive.
  As far as Bitcoin's place in things, I used the word 'aid' because I don't want to fall into the trap of technological determinism.  Though I'd like to point out that Bitcoin is a product of the open source movement.  It is being co opted by the startup space.  I think it does have the power to make money more fair, transparent, and open, and that a lot of people around it have helped grow it on that basis.  Those people are a subset of society.  I'm not trying to argue from a technological vacuum.  Plenty of work has to be done, and if I might seem technologically deterministic, it's simply because I think Bitcoin is incredibly powerful to that end while being resistant to individual motive no matter how much that motive tries to drive it.  But if society doesn't care about that or can find a way to displace money as such a huge motivator, it won't necessarily do anything for us.  
  I view it like the atom bomb.  The atom bomb was completely begat by a system of violence and warfare.  But can you argue that mutually assured destruction hasn't played a role in creating a geopolitical structure that makes full scale warfare unwieldy for even its largest potential perpetrators?  Does society benefit from it?  Obviously there are bigger losers, and plenty of problems, and we could completely blow ourselves up still, and these things have to be weighed against each other, but Europe or Japan or anywhere else isn't likely to be destroyed anytime soon, which I think is worth quite a bit.  And the atom bomb didn't have to be co-opted.  It was a direct product of nation states.  Yet overtime, I think it's played a role in reducing their (Edit) ability to end individual lives.

So to accept a transfer back to mainnet, bitcoin would (should?) require a proof that as much work has been conducted on the sidechain for an equal time period.

If I can provide you a miner/hardware wallet/node for a cheap price, at what point does the overhead of offloading namecoin (overhead including understanding, caring, etc.) outpace the benefit?  If I have a decent size stake in bitcoin, I might let my device mine for 'free' to support the network that I have a stake in without considering or even knowing about namecoin at all.  It's possible that merge mining of namecoin could be victim to a situation where as the bitcoin network becomes more distributed, it starts to act against namecoin - that is hash rate that comes online for bitcoin, but not namecoin, creates centralization in namecoin.  Edit: Maybe namecoin could be included on that device for the same desired effect, in which case namecoin also gains from the added decentralization.  This would be great at putting more namecoins into people's hands and could very well be a better scheme.
This also creates an opportunity for different protocols to compete.  Some may require signing (like your device registration below), while others are less constrained.  Consensus will determine which, if any such protocols, are maintained and useful.
Could the bitcoin community act against this? Yes, there may be a way to structure P2SH such that private-keys-as-values do not work or are prohibitively expensive.  But my general thinking is that this allows for incentives to be better aligned than maybe namecoin does.  Ultimately it's just a 'really' expensive version of namecoin with no established consensus thus far.

I was on board with bip 101's larger blocks until I actually dug into the technology of bitcoin, lightning and sidechains.  Block size will grow as we develop better science around blockchains, sure, but if you're looking for a renaissance, it isn't in one parameter of Bitcoin.  It's in an incredibly smart stack of technology surrounding a scarce digital asset that is edge-auditable.  I would rather we had arduous argument over block size than an end-all-be-all solution that we can't control in the future.  I trust in this community to find a sensible value 50 times in 50 years if that's what it takes.  I also, having seen the state of the art, know this won't be necessary; we'll one day laugh about our dark age knowledge of blockchains, but today, in the spirit of the science that will guide us there, let's not assume we know anything more than we actually do.

If the government announced regulations today about verifying your coins with some whitelist authority, the market would just react by finding a rate that thousands of people will accept for the risk of providing whitelisted coins to be mixed with unlisted ones.  If the government decides to still pursue coins across thousands of addresses, it *could* kill the fungibility of bitcoin, but then again they can already attempt that if they want to, whitelist or none.  The possibility for doing so becomes less as bitcoin grows.  It adds friction to coins connected to 'illicit activity', but then again I'm not exactly against society being able to add barriers to behavior it doesn't like.

I understand that, but if a majority of the miners switched over simultaneously, it would be an altcoin with more security and strength than 'true bitcoin'.  With all the energy that goes into figuring out how to compensate miners through transaction fees without making costs exorbitant to end-users, it's not that farfetched to think miners could take this issue into their own hands a la inflation.  It wouldn't be the first time that people close to the mint benefitted from such a scheme.

Logins.  Browser certificates.  Anything that requires authentication or can be boosted by public key encryption.  I wouldn't be surprised if 21 has something along these lines with their device (maybe using name coin).  By having a full node in your house it can act as a security appliance.  
Edit: Also works for hostname resolution in theory.  Miners are the registrars.  'Place-in-chain' is the best thing I have for now.  If there's a way to arrange registration transactions such that any subsequent attempt becomes a double spend in bitcoin, that would be ideal, but I can't quite figure out such a scheme and it also doesn't allow for expiration.

I did some further thinking on this, and you are right, but mustyoshi's reply to you is still relevant; there is a cost in blockchain overhead to obfuscation.  The question is ultimately whether this cost can reduce node eligibility to a meaningful minimum, which doesn't look likely.  It seems that the cost of obfuscating would achieve a maximum that would be outpaced by increasingly cheaper disk space and bandwidth.

Bitcoin was created to be a scarce commodity free of intermediaries.  It just so happens that the elimination of an intermediary undermines rent seeking.  Rent seeking ultimately drives the cost of transacting about a commodity up, though it's generally only observable through the external costs associated with maintaining jurisprudence about the commodity.  Small blockers are fine with not externalizing those costs today in exchange for quick gains.  Big blockers are unaware of any of this.

This is why you can just go fork your own chain.  We don't think you understand decentralization because you don't understand decentralization.
A Bitcoin node will be cheaper to run over time because it's the only way to ensure that the monetary policy stays immutable.  ANYBODY saying that you can increase the cost of running a node is making an assumption AKA introducing risk to the entire ecosystem.  If you don't care about this, then Bitcoin is not for you.  There are several ways to scale transaction throughput that shift *risk* to those trying to do so.  Everything else will fail.  If you're so confident it won't, and that we're all wrong, then stick with segwit2x and stop posting these horribly fallacious comments.

So we 'have' to take out loans and capital reinvestment from the owners to maintain any edge.
People are pretty oblivious to how things work in this economy.  Every boom is a credit bubble, every bust is a stagnation in lending.  Things are rolling right now because people are using credit to buy things.  In our case, if we don't use credit, we fall to the wayside as our reward for staying debt free.

Certainly, that's why I started thinking about what's really enforcing that limit.  See my edit, I still think it's worth considering at a very large scale for Bitcoin; greed* is a powerful force, and when you look at our current economic situation, part of the reason new USD can be created is because of how different entities interact with the USD.  The average person bares it because it at least helps alleviate debt (they may not know or care, but they don't revolt either); the banker likes it because they have access to new money sooner than the market can adjust for that money's effects on purchasing power.  I'm not condoning it, I'm just saying people have worked towards it before, and it's not harmful to consider skeptically why Bitcoin might not be immune to it.

You're asking me these questions like I have to provide the answers.  I already said that any change makes implicit assumptions about these values.  Ready for me to blow your mind?  There's no way of knowing if Bitcoin is actually decentralized enough with 1 MB.

'Outbound' connections are capped at 8.
'Inbound' connections are capped by the `maxconnections` parameter (which includes outbound connections).
To increase the total number of connections, you'd want to look at the `maxconnections` setting and otherwise forward port 8333 as others have mentioned.
I should note that the crappy modems+routers that the ISPs hand out, and WiFi if that's how you're connected, will put a soft limit on your incoming connections.

Bitcoin is N^2 from the fact that all nodes validate all transactions.  m is just a coefficient to highlight that transactions can be a multiple of users.  Of course, not all bitcoin users run a node, and there's certainly a spectrum between a fully validating, forwarding node, and a blocks only node, etc., but the existence of trustless, autonomous money with a monetary policy enforced by consensus will, until someone invents something to say otherwise, always be the product of its economic participants' will as expressed through what they're willing and unwilling to enforce through validation and propagation via their node.
If you own bitcoins, but do not run a node, you're ultimately at the mercy of those who do (whether that node is associated with mining or not).  If you're invested in any of the properties of bitcoins, or care to change them, or prevent them from changing, you're incentivized to run a node.  If you think that some small subset of actors will enforce policy as benefactors to the rest of the economic participants, then Bitcoin can theoretically be O(1), but then we already have that in pretty much every other currency on the planet, and it's proven that the small subset of actors will prioritize self-serving policy before that of all participants.  Therefore, if you believe Bitcoin can exist beyond centralisation and a prerequisite of trust, Bitcoin is at worst case N^2 if it preserves the 'best case' scenario for as marginal an economic participant as possible.

If you don't run a node, you're trusting other people to administrate the mint.  Literally every currency to come before is an example of why you don't do this.  So will be every currency to come after it.  It's really not worth arguing about anymore.
Higher requirements = Lower Requirements.

[This gives some info](  
The above article isn't politically biased.  I'll say that this is happening now: BIP141, which has been cooking for a long time now, required 95% of hash rate to activate.  That BIP will expire in September, and it doesn't seem like it's going to activate before then.  The code of BIP141 is generally considered a good thing as it patches in Segregated Witness, which fixes transaction malleability, while enabling quite a few other features directly or as a consequence of that fix to transaction malleability.  The end result is just a way better Bitcoin, a next-gen Bitcoin.
A large percentage of hash rate is tied up with a group of miners that are using the expiration date as an opportunity to play brinksmanship.  SegWit 2x hardforks to a larger block size while implementing the SegWit activation of BIP141.  BIP148 is a last ditch effort to circumvent miners to activate BIP141 by having nodes, whether they are mining or not, signal that they will not accept non-SegWit blocks exclusively after an arbitrary date.
This is happening now because the much needed features of BIP141 are being used as leverage by a political group in Bitcoin to change the political order of Bitcoin such that Core is no longer the ranking source of Bitcoin implementation and development.  This fight *has* to happen now because the first wave of layer 2 scaling of Bitcoin is enabled by SegWit, and so the miners and their political cohort will lose much of their leverage over Bitcoin since their incredibly suspicious prerequisite that Bitcoin scale on-chain will be increasingly laughable as the better tech gets rolled out.  It's simply the best opportunity for a coup on Bitcoin that anyone is ever going to get.

Most of us are fine with the trade-off because we know that it's either not scalable or it will simply take time.
I probably share your general take.  The possibility for Ethereum as a decentralized system was thrown out in favor of 'cool, exciting, shared state magic' blockchain nonsense.  Bitcoin's scaling problems are manageable in that the vision is simple and - what nobody in the industry seems to want to understand - already damn close to the cutting edge of what can actually be achieved in a decentralized fashion.

It has been tried.  My opinion on the best solution is to use something like blockstore (or eventually something else as decentralized KV gets better figured out) to associate a pubkey with a handle and a URL for their tweets.  Then just aggregate on the front end.  It's not efficient, but it doesn't require a domain specific blockchain and it leaves market problems to the market.

Bitcoin wasn't premined beyond getting the network up and running.  If you subscribed to the mailing list, satoshi didn't have that much of a head start.  Also, nobody offered any money for bitcoins initially.
As far as Ethereum goes, it's probably going to be worth more than $30 billion, but that argument isn't that great.  Bernie Madoff took $18 billlion from investors and generated fabricated gains and for a total fabricated fund value of $65 billion and dollars were worth more back then...
One thing to consider on the Ethereum valuation though is that 72 million ether were premined, 60 million for the crowdsale and 12 million for the developers I assume.  There are 92 million ether today.  Satoshi's 1 million BTC account for ~6% of all bitcoins today, while ICO + founders ETH owners account for over 75%.  Considering the conversations I've had with people hyped about ETH, I seriously doubt that is being priced in correctly.
I don't think it's fair to call Ethereum a scam.  I do think it's completely dishonest to call it decentralized though.  Ever tried running a validating node?  It's a huge PITA.

Hence why minimum system requirements for Bitcoin must tend towards zero.

Upping the requirements of the software doesn't create more software users.

I'd guess a million at least.  I know a few people that mined in 2010 that lost hundreds between them.  On that note: If you or someone you know lost coins way back then, remind yourself or them that they almost definitely wouldn't have held on until now.  I  didn't learn to hodl until after Gox, when it was clear that they weren't worth $1000, but that someday they absolutely would be at least.

It's not artificially limited.  Run a node and throw hash power behind what you want to be the solution.
@_date: 2016-07-06 04:28:07
N^2 m.  Lightning scales the m.  Sidechains scale the N.
The mechanics of Lightning trade time-value of money for more granularity in transacting.  The mechanics of sidechains trade trust up the stack for keeping the mint (Bitcoin mainnet) open and honest.

Yes, the people who would be fine with just fixing transaction malleability via segwit, an objective bug, so that well-researched work can continue as a product of their devotion to their crafts, and who have massive, low time preference investments in literal bitcoins, which they gathered as they stewarded the project from year zero to year 8 and beyond, are the ones who want to change Bitcoin.


So you just want it to be a way, and you're not interested in which way is actually better?  Which way leverages the world of computer science, mathematics, and economics to the greatest solution?  You'd rather use dubious claims about my elitism and my willingness to 'change bitcoin into something that it isn't' (by not changing it, mental backflips are fun) than listen to the people who actually built the fuggin thing?
You're not paid enough to write this drivel.

And that an asset with infinite velocity is also an optimal store of value per Craig Wright.  It's all truly stupid.  The market cannot select beyond what it 'knows' though, and Fiat is what it knows.

How did you get your bitcoins?  If I'm the state and I deem your transaction illegal, there are a few measures you would have had to have taken to increase deniability, and they're relatively expensive compared to regular ole' cash.  You're right, in easy to transfer I should have said 'inexpensive'.
Also, in what world is Adam Back's Bitcoin 'bank settlement'.  I can't audit the banks.  I can audit the blockchain.  It's disingenuous to equate the Bitcoin main net as a means of settlement between higher layers as not digital cash.  It's disingenuous to call increasing the block size any more measurable a means to digital cash than the above as well.
An aside: What you call word games is actually just denotation.

Bitcoin already isn't digital cash.  Cash is private and untraceable.  Bitcoins today are far from that without great expense in obfuscation, and yes, transaction fees.
[Confidential Transactions]( move Bitcoin closer to digital cash and they are a  research project of Greg's.  They all claim to want digital cash, but depending on your definition of cash, only some are telling the truth.  If cash just means easy to transfer, then you don't want bitcoins.

It's my reply.  I've read enough r/btc to understand why anything that doesn't correlate with the party platform must be relegated to a 'retort' though.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:23:29


I can't help you here.  You think bitcoins can only be transferred on Bitcoin, which isn't true.  I gave my brother a paper wallet and we called it a transaction.  It's prerequisite wasn't even 100% trust either, given that I have shit incentives to steal from my own family.  There are plenty of papers written on the subject of transacting off-chain, with varying degrees of trust or liquidity or latency involved.  It turns out that you can do it without sacrificing anything besides a little bit of risk, as opposed to trying to cram every transaction on main net at the risk of audit-ability. 
How can a DDOS cap be temporary without a solution?  Are you going to pay the extra cost to me to run a node if you increase the blocksize? No? Then it doesn't look like there's a solution.


It shows computer science.  You can have all the things you want without risking Bitcoin.  On a side chain.  The positive externality of being able to audit Bitcoin is not worth attempting to 'do both'.  Increasing a number by a static amount every time it gets expensive to transact is easily the least imagination required solution that could possibly be put forth.
Edit: If someone was able to bootstrap a merge mined sidechain that was basically a clone of Bitcoin with a higher block size, I'd be one of the first people trying to figure out how to implement a retargetable block size that provably meets the requirement that % hash rate be 1:1 with % blocks won.  That's the entree into figuring out how to achieve a retargetable block size that doesn't alienate very small stakeholders in terms of btc stake, but that is incredibly low on the list of priorities given how much more can be done elsewhere for greater effect overall.  People being willy nilly with the block size just simply don't understand what they're risking, or they do which is worse.
