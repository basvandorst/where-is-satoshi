Q so does this mean that bitcoin is basically dead.  I mean not dead like it's going to just die.  but that the transaction fee's will likely kill it off slowly.  Cus from what I can see if you can't use BTC to actually buy stuff then it's underlining value is compromised.

Looks like I was dead on. now to phase two of my master plan.  I must gather the 7 sacred treasures to revive the dark lord, and bring forth the next great age of bitcoin.

That's what I'm looking for as well unfortunately to looks like that momentum to get back up there has died.  I think were going to be stuck between 8-12 for the next 2-3 weeks.  I don't think it will get back up to 20K for a long long time, there's just to many problems with the way transaction fee's are calculated.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:36:47
so do you know what the input's and outputs stand for?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:58:02
Still very confused.  From what I understand the formula is.
in*180 + out*34 + 10 plus or minus 'in'
how do I determine the in's and out to the dollar amount.  (this is percentage based on how much I send right?)
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:29:34
I think it's flat lined at worst it could hit 8K but it's already pretty tantalizing at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:43:12
It's funny but your probably safer with alt coins then you are with bitcoin.  If you want to get out wait for bitcoin to pop back up to 12,000 then sell. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:59:56
I think it's finally found a bottom at 9,500 I'm hoping for a recovery to 11,000 by tomorrow. There is no way this crash is being driven by Korea, boom investors are pulling out because they realized that the market cap was to high on these big coins. (looks like I was right, and now... We Pray.)
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:28:11
thank's that was useful. I'm still trying to figure out how to calculate the in and out though.  Do you know how I can calculate that as part of the formula "in x 184 + out x 34 + 10 plus or minus in"  Also does this mean I'm able to edit my transactions to give myself a lower fee.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:13:47
well we will find out soon enough.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:51:11
Lol it might have been the breaking point but bitcoin was really trying to get back up to 15,000 anyway.  I do believe though that bitcoin is in the process of being replaced though by Etherium due it it's inability to reduce it's transaction fee's.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:37:01
BTC, doesn't the transaction fee come out to 1.5%? or is it a flat fee? Sorry I'm having difficulty figuring this out.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:54:07
could you explain this to me I heard that BTC was dead because of extremely high transaction fee's, is that not the case anymore?
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:29:20
Question.  How will this effect mining?
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:18:17
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:57:32
I'm interested in how this will effect mining.  If the fee's are lower does that mean that miners get less.  Right now when you mine you get the coin + a portion of the transaction fee's so this may mean that people will be making 10-20% less mining.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:17:21
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:50:26
blow's my mind that people are still saying this as it drop's to 8000.  I'm don't chasing the bottom, I'll wait for it to level out.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:47:27
Well keep in mind we've only been stable for a couple of days.  I do expect there to be a jump to between 9-10k but I'm worried we might have another correction after that down to 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:19:51
well see I think it's going get to 5k at the lowest and then change direction.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:14:44
I do believe that Transaction fee's were partly responsible for the recent crash.  Here's hoping this lets us scale properly this time around.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:24:22
It should people are reporting lower transaction fee's.  Not sure if were going so see the effects right away since most of the pending transactions have been cleared.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:47:46
maybe but holding clearly isn't the solution, I sold 50% today, if it go's under 8000 I'll withdraw the rest and wait for the market to make up it's mind.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:17:10






2K is way to low of a number.  If you think it's going to 2k then you basically believe it's in a death spiral.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:03:56
I think thats a little generous a lot of people are ready to sell at 7000 I think it's probably going to push it to at the very least 6000 maybe 5000.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:02:13
I saw a chart that I think is probably a pretty good perdiction.   I think it's clear at this point that bitcoin is likely to go under the protected level of 8500 maybe as far as 4000 then it will shoot back up and probably reach the 10,000 mark.  my reasoning behind this is that there are a ton of sell orders in the 7000 range that I expect to be triggered when it breaks that level.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:41
Yes were getting close, so close I can almost tast it.  I think we could get to 6 or 5 thousand but your going to start seeing a lot more resistance.
