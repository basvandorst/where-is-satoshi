"We are familiar with a tip about Bitcoin, but at this time we will not provide more information about the investigation," said Metlid.

Garbage rooms and common areas in the apartment block are end-facing in search of clues. It is not known if something has been found interesting in the investigation. Wednesday night there are crimes technicians in the scene. Killers investigators have conducted surveys in the neighborhood. The police state that they have made many testimonies, but do not want to go into what has come from these testimonies.
The deceased 24-year-old's family has asked for peace and does not want to express themselves in the media. - They are terribly awful
Peder Morset is a lawyer for the family, telling them tough.

He does not want to comment on any motives in the case or if the victim was in conflict with anyone in advance of the murder.
Wednesday at 12 o'clock police and updating.
"We're going through video and doing surveys in the area. It is still the case that we have no arrests or suspects in the case, says the head of joint unit for intelligence and investigation in Oslo police Grete Lien Metlid.
The police are now focusing on mapping movements around the knife-killing 24-year-old. So far, the police will not go into the forensic tracks that are secured or anything about the killing weapon. "For now, we can not say anything about the deadlock. We also can not say anything about a motive for the action, Metlid states.
The time when the comrades went to bed on Monday is the last safe observation of the 24-year-old. The comrades in the community in Arbo's gate at Majorstua had a fun Sunday evening. Relatively early everyone walked and left, but what happened after that is still the big question for the police.

Grete Lien Metlid states that one roommate did not sleep at that night.
Two of the boys in the community have explained to the police that they left the apartment around 07.50 Monday morning to attend work and school.
The killed 24-year-old should have actually met at work at 09, but never met. The next known observation of the killings is according to police when one of the roommates found him at 12.15.
The police are now working on a bomb to find out what happened in the four hours between 07.50 and 12.15.
Dozens of knife sticks
The roommate notified the health service, who again alerted the police. The 24-year-old was quickly found dead.
Sources say to TV 2 that the murder appears to be brutal, and that the deceased was inflicted on many knife stings.
The police have received more tips on the matter, but it is still unclear when the 24 year-old was killed and how the perpetrator or perpetrators got into the apartment. On Tuesday afternoon, the police received the preliminary autopsy report and stated that the report confirms that it is a very serious matter.
