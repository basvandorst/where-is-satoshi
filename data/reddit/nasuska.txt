I listen to Andreas Antonopoulos, not Roger (rich prick) Ver. Bitcoin cash does not have the depth of developers and their scaling will be eventually limited.  Andreas says  that with the Bitcoin Lightning Network we will eventually  have billions of transactions per second. He calls it (streaming money). So I'll keep my BTC and HODL.﻿

I heard about btc about 4000 and bought at 7000 luckily I sold at 15500 after the first “Dip” however i bought more at 11000 because i didnt think it was going to depreciate more... so its a win 80% loose 20%

It was great once they took calls though. Alex just shut up well the listeners, who happened to be rather informed, put him right in his place. He was literally attempting to sell BCash as BTC to the ill informed.

I'm very close to a bitcoin maximalist although I don't like the term. Despite this, I really don't think that calling everything else than bitcoin a scam is helpful. It comes across as needlessly aggressive, it is not a factual argument and likely to antagonise ppl.

This market is manipulated so hard man. They did a great job hyping BTC to 20K then making it to down to 6K. This next bull run will be to 50K and the cycle will repeat :
