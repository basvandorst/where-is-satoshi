believe me , you would have not "hodled", you buy btc at $5 , you sure as hell would have sold at $100 nobody would ever assume it would ever touch $50 in those days.

lol, its all good man, shit happens, the account thing getting hacked was totally 100% my fault, I did not secure it properly.
also when ur buying drugs on dark web, u can't expect things to be all safe and smooth.
its pretty shitty though Ill admit, logging on and seeing a 0.000 btc balance, felt shitty about that for weeks.

if it makes u feel better I once spent 15 btc on an ounce of weed around 2012 , 
and around 2016 before alphabay got shutdown, my account which had a little less then 2 btc got hacked. 
still haunts me

im not so sure throwing 30k at once was so wise, i think 10k down and 1-3k a week after would have been a better move imho(dca).
anyways, just be fully prepared to possibly see your 30k become 20k if things keep going south.
