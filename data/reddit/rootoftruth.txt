You think that some races are less intelligent than others. By definition, you are a racist. 
It's bullshit because IQ has been shown to be linked to socioeconomic environment more so than "race," which is a nebulous concept anyways. Italians and Irish weren't white a century ago.

More like taking steps to avoid people only hiring people with similar backgrounds to them. Personal bias towards the familiar is a real problem for any untrained hiring staff.

Socioeconomic environment matters way more than race, as I stated in the part of my comment that you quoted above. Did you miss that part or are you being obtuse on purpose to push your agenda? 


This isn't true because of historical inequalities and the fact that people will always like those more similar to themselves. Unless they have specific training, they are not equipped to eliminate their own unscientific biases. Male hiring staff might look for masculine confidence in hires and not realize that competent employees may not need this trait. 
Race and wealth are linked. Wealth influences your IQ.

Are they in direct competition with Coinbase?

It seems Circle goes a step further with currency conversion, whereas Coinbase is only a marketplace for BTC. Am I correct?
