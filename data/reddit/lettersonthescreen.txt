What would happen if a big bank or government with money to burn just bought all the available bitcoins?

I guess my question is, what could a government do to shut down the bitcoin economy? This seems like something relatively pain free for the bank/government that could be done as long as it occurs before the bitcoin economy reaches a critical mass. At the current time the economy is basically nonexistent because of the high volatility of the market.

I would say yes. I'll be buying some as soon as they bottom out.

Buy at the bottom.

I think we're still before the stealth phase, if we use that image for reference. It's like a computer game that is still in alpha, it's still in development but people are using it to test for vulnerabilities. We have found that having a centralized exchange is a bad idea and we need a p2p exchange. The price will drop again but this time we'll have a few more people who believe bitcoin is worthwhile even after this crash. And I think it will keep cycling like this until it works or there is a replacement. Pandora's box is open now though; fiat money is collapsing and the peasants of the world have discovered that we don't need our government/big bank overlords anymore, something will replace fiat within our lifetime.

The whole mindset of people being less sophisticated because they don't know about bitcoins is what he was attacking. The attitude implies that we need to dumb down the message into something for the average person and people that know about bitcoins are somehow above them. You seemed to miss his point and then go on to say that advertising was a dignified way of communication, which I agree with, but if you come from a standpoint that the people you are advertising to are less sophisticated (which implies less intelligent) then your ad will seem like pandering and which is not dignified. That's why the whoosh.

P2p exchanges.
