My understanding is that the our ability to trust a blockchain requires it be decentralized otherwise the person/persons mining the blocks can alter the blocks.  Trust is the key reason for those that praise the blockchain technology, an unalterable public ledger of transactions.  Am I mistaken?

My guess is the download server is being flooded with traffic as I am now on hour 12, waiting on the wallet to finish the sync.  That is great news if my guess is correct.  Let's test the hell out of this thing, get all bugs ironed out so the developers will give the green light for mainnet.

My take is that the most Bitcoins sit in the wallets of people that truly believe in the power Bitcoin has to change the world.  Thus the BTC are not on the market for sale.  We will wait for LN to take off and then use our BTC to make everyday purchases.  We are believers!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:47:15
Demand is low.  Right now the FUD is keeping new funds on the sidelines.  My hope is that the exchanges have accepted and verified thousands of new accounts since the December dip.  Once LN takes off demand will surge as those sitting with an empty account will see the FUD for what it is and become BTC believers.  Can't wait to use my BTC to make everyday purchases.  So long fiat!!

True!!  I hope we get to 1 million per coin but, can it realistically happen if it would double the number of billionaires?  Of course that would only happen if the Hodlers of 1000+ coins do not sell out on the way up.

The internet says their are 2600 Billionaires in the world (based on US dollar).  A 1 million dollar Bitcoin would significantly increase that number.   So, I do not believe BTC will reach that value.  But, I hope it does.  So is it your belief that all of the crypto analysts that project a 1 million dollar coin are doing so counting on hyper inflation of fiat?
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:21:06
So why are you on the BTC channel.  Could it be you are being paid to spread hate against crypto.  My advice is take the fiat the banks are paying you and purchase some Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-11-26 01:46:51
Agree on being worth a lot, but 1 million per coin seems like a dream more than reality.  But I hope it does get close.
@_date: 2019-11-26 03:50:28
I agree that it is unlikely that the wallet holders will not sell part of their stack on the way up.  But a 1 million BTC price would still significantly impact the Billionaire club if it reaches 1million.
Many of the wallets with 1000+ coins have been dormant for over 5 years so they are unlikely to belong to an exchange.  
I simply cannot see BTC teaching 1 million per coin.  But I hope it does.

My reference was near term, not generationally.  Warren Buffet is not going to lose his fortune in the next ten years, nor will the majority of the 2000+ billionaires.  So can Bitcoin produces another 2000+ billionaires in the next 5-10 years is the question?  I hope yes, but it would be an amazing feat.
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:27:16
Not everyone, but some will be interested and they will be glad they said yes to accepting crypto once fiat crashes due to inflation.  Which will not happen with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:51:06
You are not forcing your friends into accepting bitcoin, you are making them an offer.  If you have bitcoin then you believe in the future of electronic currency, so why not suggest to your friends that they take part in this new asset class.  I bet your friends would have loved it if you could have reimbursed them in google stock ten hears ago.  We need to encourage adoption as bitcoin is not a company so it is us users that must spread the positive word about bitcoin.

People with money tend to keep their money.  A Bitcoin boom will not diminish then number of current billionaires.  Most will join in and increase their wealth as well.
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:37:26
Read an article where the wallets that had between 1 and 10 BTC going into 2018 have added to their balance.  So I am not sure are on our way to mass adoption, but those in the community still believe and are accumulating at these low prices.

There are 2060 billionaires in the world.  Up massively?  If BTC goes to 1 million per coin in the next few years we will likely have over 4000 billionaires.  Is that reasonable?  Can BTC go to 1 million?

I am not a developer, but I view it like email.  You have an email address that is public, you tell your friends and they can send you mail.  All of your friends use the same address for you.  In crypto you can send different people different addresses, but the BTC still arrives in your wallet.  The blockchain knows where the BTC was sent because each address is connected to your private key.  You can use block explorer to see transactions to a specific wallet address.  As long as it works I am happy.  I trust it because the code is open source and a lot of smart people are keeping an eye on one another.

You will have to pay a fee to move your Bitcoin .  The wallet likely has likely calculated the fee they will take to transfer your Bitcoin.  Or, you purchased via credit card and they will not release all of your coins until a later date?  This just shows how little most of us know about Bitcoin storage.

Crypto.com is not a bank.  They use banking relationships with payment processors to allow crypto holders to sell their crypto for everyday purchases.  The banks cannot put a freeze on my crypto.com card like they do with their bank cards.  I can spend my crypto anywhere and the banks have no say.  Unless the banks shut down the use of all cards via strong arming the payment processors my card will be approved.  Whereas wells Fargo could easily put a hold on my wells Fargo card if they wanted to keep me from my money.  But they cannot keep me from my crypto.  Once all merchants accept direct crypto transfers we will be free of banks and third party intermediaries like crypto.com.

Sales at a local PetsMart: two years ago at the close of a Saturday the fiat sales for the day were about $6k with some credit card sales.

My degree is in Mathematics and the security and decentralized nature of many crypto currencies will change the economic world.  P2P exchange of value without third party control is revolutionary.

Do people look at the price of Gold before purchasing?  They buy if they see a risk to reward ratio they like or if they fear inflation.  Same goes for Bitcoin.  But unlike Gold, you have possession of Bitcoin and it can be used as a currency.  Additionally, we know how much Bitcoin will ever exist.

HODL is what I am doing with Bitcoin, Realestate, IRA, 401k, etc....  HODL is the basis for most investment strategies.  Spread your money among several asset classes along with periodic rebalancing so that no one asset class gets too large.  You choose your asset classes and distribution percentages based on research and risk to reward analysis.  You do not believe in Bitcoin, so do not invest.

It sounds like you are a merchant and customers are complaining about the fees from coinbase.  Encourage them to move their bitcoin from coinbase to GDAX, ( a free transfer as GDAX is the coinbase exchange )  Then they can pay transfer funds to you free of fees.  Better yet, they can send the funds on GDAX to a private wallet that they download on their phone: Jaxx, BRD, etc.  Then their bitcoin is safer and when they pay their bill the fee will be cents not dollars.

Openning a channel is comparable to going to an ATM and putting fiat in your pocket, it is now waiting to be spent.  You only put in your pocket that which you believe you will need and maybe a bit extra.  Same goes for funding a channel.  Except the ATM charges a much bigger fee.

Not sure where you live, but that matters very little.  If you believe in BTC as do I and most of the subscribers on r/bitcoin, all you need to do is download a wallet to your phone or computer: BRD, Jaxx, etc.  Some reddit posts suggest one wallet over an other for various reasons but the popular ones all give you control over your private key ( a 12 to 24 word pass phrase ).  Write the words down a store them in a secure place.  The wallets are free so no need to worry about experimenting a bit.  I personally have used three different wallets over time.  Once you have a wallet you are ready to purchase bitcoin. 
Where you purchase your bitcoin is also well debated:  Gemini, Coinbase, Localbitcoins, wall of coins, etc.  I personally started with coinbase as it was the easiest to download and verify my bank account but now use Gemini.  Many Bitcoin users have left coinbase because they overcharge for fees.  Gemini took longer to verify my bank account.  The fastest way to purchase is localbitcoin.com you meet up with a bitcoin owner and purchase directly from them.  Buy a few hundred dollars at first then once you know they will not rob you of your cash when you meet up, you can make regular purchases.  Most on this site would recommend buying in over time to dollar cost average in your investment.  But seeing as how you mentioned selling if the market begins to drop, you will need to sign up with an exchange so you can jump ship if you get nervous.  Your skittishness regarding bitcoin probably means you should find something else to invest in as BTC will continue to wildly fluctuate.  New technology takes a while to become stable.  However, if you truly believe in BTC then buy in, close your eyes and ears for a year or two and see what happens.  My guess, you open them and you are at the moon.  Good luck.  Owning Bitcoin does not take an advisor.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:44:17
Any guess as to how many are actually changing hands verses how many are being HODL?  I am guessing that a majority have been in the same wallet for over a year.  Thus the volatility.  Hopefully we get more liquidity once LN is fully deployed.
