What I'm saying is that Coinbase should be responsive and process orders in the agreed upon time-frame. When they don't uphold their end of the agreement, they should expect customers to use twitter, reddit, and other sources to raise awareness of the problem.

The big difference this time is the publicity BTC has gotten the past two months. Every day there are new articles about BTC in mainstream media sources. 
People with money are starting to notice and people with money are always looking for ways to make more money. That's a good sign for BTC.

The truth is, it doesn't do anything right now for the average joe. (average joe in america is low income, low technology).
Unless the government starts paying out entitlements in bitcoin, there really is no benefit right now. 
But, once drug dealers and other small time criminals start using bitcoin on their cell phones, instead of dollars, then average joe will buy.

Doesn't surprise me that they are being stubborn about fixing this issue. The development team is stubborn.
The biggest failure of localbitcoins is that it doesn't let you send a message to other members unless you've initiated a transaction with them.
I like the site and have used it a lot, but not being able to message someone with a question prior to initiating a financial transaction is just ridiculous. 
I've considered developing a similar site/service but one that is responsive to customers.

When bitcoin is unknown, the early adopters (i.e., fanatics and nerds like us) want it. 
When bitcoin gets some press, the trend-setters jump in to make a buck.
When bitcoin becomes popular, common people start buying it up.
When bitcoin becomes trendy, like 50 fucking shades of gray, early 20s females start buying.
When bitcoin becomes overbought, grandmas start buying it.
I will sell my holdings to grandma and look for the next project to adopt.

Gotcha. So why was the system going to let me buy coins the day I registered and told me I only had a 5-day wait? 
Coinbase really sucks. Their website is complete shit when it comes to explaining this information clearly and concisely. And they don't reply to emails. I won't recommend them to anyone. Fuckers.
I'll keep using localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:08:14
Right, but even though he (presumably) had proof the money was being transferred, the seller still claimed he was going to walk with the escrow. That's a dick move and worth of losing your head on youtube.

I think the OP has a very fair point and it's one that I've been pondering too. People are already saying bitcoin is too expensive because it's $1,000 per bitcoin. But most of these people don't know what they are talking about. They are judging 1 (one) individual unit as being too expensive because they cannot afford to buy one individual unit. They can only afford to buy a tenth, and one tenth does not seem like a lot, so they naturally think that it's too expensive because they cannot have a full "one."
The "they" I refer to above are the general population...who will need to be convinced to use bitcoin if the currency is going to take off and go anywhere for the long term.
I think mBTC is a good idea. I hope it catches on. BTC ends up being the larger denomination that few people deal in...and everyday transactions are conducted in the mBTC unit.

You are cutting them too much slack. If they want to handle people's money, then they should have the system in place to do so.

I always get downvoted when I say it, but coinbase is an amateur shop. I think the action today proves it. Can't keep up with buys, can't keep up with sells. It's all good if you know and accept what you're getting when you do business with them.
I think Coinbase spends their money employing reps at a call center in India to downvote negative comments on reddit.

The problem with bitcoin is people think in whole numbers but 1 bitcoin is expensive for most people so you'll hear them say it's too expensive right now. People won't think in terms of the limits of the currency and what that means for the future price. And they can't be bothered to calculate transactions in tenths or hundredths of a bitcoin. I have no faith in the laziness and stupidity of mankind but I do think there is hype to cash in on in the near term. Cheers mate.

Sorry, I won't cut any institution slack that wants me to trust them with my money and banking information but can't provide a consistent and reliable service.

Coinbase isn't a forum or some other trivial online service -- they are in the finance business and want us to trust them with our money. There is no margin for error.

What you're missing is that coinbase customers should not be concerned with how many other customer tickets exist. As a customer, it's only your ticket that matters and when it has to do with your money, you expect a prompt answer.

Hopefully someone else can say with better certainty, however, I believe the above message from Coinbase was for people who wanted to purchase when Coinbase was out of coins. They were essentially telling buyers that they could send money to Coinbase and Coinbase will go ahead and make a transaction at market price on Friday.
That said, I think those of us who were able to buy coins but stil have to wait until Friday for the transaction to go through, are safe. If I'm right, when we made the purchase today, Coinbase reserved those coins for us at the current price. Once we wait the four business days, Coinbase will release those coins to us at the price we paid today.
Coinbase gurus, am I right? Wrong? Halfway there? All dicked up?

Dude, I applaud your effort, but you can review my comment history and see that I constantly get downvoted for carrying forward the ideas you present -- that customers have every right to hold companies (such as coinbase) accountable when they do not meet expected customer service levels. Good luck getting the point across in the forum.

Oh man, bummer. I made my first Coinbase purchase today. Purchased .5 BTC. Just decided I wanted to add another .5 but can't make any purchases until this transaction clears on Friday.
I wonder, can I cancel this transaction and then immediately make a purchase for the larger amount (1 BTC)?
Edit: Fuck me, the price dropped $200 in about 20 minutes. Glad I wasn't able to buy extra. God loves me, bitchez!

I'm calling them amateur because they don't respond timely to emails from clients (it shouldn't take three days to reply to an inquiry about a problem with an account) and because it seems every 2-3 weeks they have another outage or major issue that completely removes buy/sell capability. 
That level of service is not acceptable in this business where time = money.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:15:19
You guys keep asking for customers to be patient but what you don't seem to realize is you're dealing with their money. These transactions are based on money, not some trading cards. If your systems can't scale then you should significantly reduce the amount of volume you take on a daily basis.
I'm not trying to slam you, but reddit and other forums are full of disgruntled users and all we keep getting is "please be patient" and "please understand."
Meanwhile, you collect interest on our money while it sits in your account.
Come on, coinbase, if you're servicing 440,000 customers then use some of that investment money you got to hire the staff to get the job done!
