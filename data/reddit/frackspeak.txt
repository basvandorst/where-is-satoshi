Bank accounts get hacked all the time but payments made from them can be reversed so there is a limit to what the hackers can gain. Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed.
Bank IT systems are managed by professionals so while individual accounts can be hacked because of poor security on the part of customers the bank's entire network is unlikely to be hacked. Bitcoin is similar in this regard. Individual users get hacked all the time but the network can't be hacked.

Encrypt means to turn the private key into scrambled text. To unscramble that is called decrypting and requires the password originally used to encrypt it. Before you can use your private key you have to decrypt it. Does this clear things up for you?
