He wouldn't have to fake much in that case, IMO

LocalEth is pretty much like localbtc except they don't rat out your ID and they also allow cash. I wish bisq would be this simple. Because idk what else is there for BTC now.
@_date: 2019-07-27 20:06:10
No just Eth, you can always ask your counterparty tho, some are willing. Otherwise you'd have to take it to some non KYC exchange to swap it. Still worth the privacy IMO.

I legit went like "is that still around?"
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:55:44


Yes, I have just recently discovered this as well. It's poor judgement, not you being fundamentally a mistake. 
And... I was dirt poor too, for a very long time. So I understand that as well. I think there will be a time you'll need to be very alone if you're ever to stop struggling with life, perhaps. But that's just a thought that comes from my experience.

You can stay freely, as long as your country visa or other allows. If you stay longer than 180 days in a year you may become tax liable but this is never enforced and widely abused. You don't need a proof of income to rent or buy, the owner might want it if you look shabby or are a single female but it's not a legal requirement.
The classical music scene still exists, but especially now in the summer season be prepared to not see any Czech people ever anywhere - it's Russians and Chinese only. They drove the property and lease prices up accordingly so the locals were forced out. 
Just saying this because that was a deal-breaker for me, the city looks pretty on a photo but the vibe is really bad unless you're permanently drunk or fully isolated in a lux condo... Prague is a dying place.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:08:09
Because all the people with income from other countries (or no countries) have moved there. Same as Prague.

Lol ok, go on and send some bitcoin from coinbase to an online casino.
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:34:10
Jeez this is brilliant
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:18:52
They have been stealing since 2016 I wonder how there are still ppl who trade there
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:49:00
So they wrote an article about the twitter post?
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:52:28
Itaipu Ñane Mbae!
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:10:30
Yeah but it's not like it were better to just not do anything.
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:11:13
This is so cool I can't
Well done
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:07:48
Now it's getting somewhere
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:12:04
Can you lose wow gold in a boat accident?
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:40:38
I disagree. Doing something stupid at least can show what seems to be something stupid in the given situation.
Do you think bank run is something stupid?
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:14:49
Not born in PY but very familiar with the country.

Stuff is banned all over on all crypto reddits. Custom domains are blog spam, steem is spam, affils is EVIL...smh
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:16:04
I also wonder who'll be first to the key, hope they'll post here. 
Maybe if we upvote this post enough news outlets will pick it up.
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:11:55
That's pretty cool
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:05:02
Was that when you made the one with the hidden seed phrase?
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:03:09
This. 
Gotta give one thing to op though - contents of metal boxes don't show on airport scans. Sometimes they ask to open them, sometimes I get to keep my spare lighters.

Some vendors on local bitcoins sell via PayPal with some markup.

They had ads running in Vietnam hiring lots of staff just two months back. They're probably switching to outsourcing, or optimizing for location.
The article cites "optimization" btw.
