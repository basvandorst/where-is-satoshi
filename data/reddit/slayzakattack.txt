Australia also only has 24 million people, fewer densely packed cities, fewer gangs, different health care system, etc. Just pointing at the number of shootings and the gun control laws is a pretty basic argument.

Do they? I just checked CMC and Abra was just under a dollar cheaper than CBP. I hadn’t noticed the price difference you speak of since I uninstalled Coinbase from my phone once I started using Gemini a while back. The draw back with Abra is having to wait for funds to clear as well. This is where Gemini come into play for me. If I need to FOMO in, I use Gemini. That’s if my Abra USD wallet is empty.

Abra is the cheapest BTC/Fiat gateway I’ve found with Zero fees on purchases.

This is an amazing tip. I use that so often never even crossed my mind to apply it here. Thanks!

Cool idea. Still chance of loss tho.
I’m working on memorizing it. 2 words a day. Since I say it out loud a bunch in the morning my wife is also memorizing it.

Yeah.. but when shooting a television, or really any subject/scene that has more horizontal possibilities, why am I looking at the wall and tv stand instead of the intended content?

Now how many buyers paid with crypto?

Awesome! Doing your part. I like it!

Genisis is way cheaper. I haven't noticed any of the foreign transaction fees and they only charged me a $1.25 fee to purchase ETH. I could be wrong as I'm not counting pennies but it seems that Genisis is way better than coinbase.
