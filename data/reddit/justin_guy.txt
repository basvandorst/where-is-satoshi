Amazing! I am going to play with it this weekend :)

As a simple explanation it is not possible. Perhaps if you gave an example of what you were trying to accomplish I could point you in the right direction.
As a more advanced explanation it is technically possible but would require a lot of bitcoin, many many transactions, and it would be just as complicated to get out of the blockchain as it was to put in. Currently the only "socially acceptable" method of storing data in the blockchain is with the OP_RETURN script and the limit is currently 40 bytes. Using that for a 2mb photo you would need more than 50,000 bitcoin transactions (all with a fee). Then to retrieve the photo you would need a way to gather all those transactions in the correct order and put it back together.
Alternative blockchains and technologies have addressed this. One worth checking out is:

I understand your reasoning but proofofexistence.com actually creates less blockchain bloat.
If you use the Btproof method every time you create a timestamp it creates a spendable output (UTXO). This is because the small amount of Bitcoin you sent to the address is a standard Bitcoin transaction and the output is spendable in the future (the network is unaware that you don't have the private key). All of these spendable outputs have to be kept track of in memory, basically like they are waiting to spent, but in your case they never will be.
When you use OP_RETURN the network knows you are storing something and that it is not creating a spendable output. As such it doesn't have to keep it in RAM.
This is the first article I referenced when I was investigating this: 
Edit: Btproof.com was more of a hack similar to what a lot of developers were doing in the past (thus creating the need and addition of OP_RETURN). I noticed the haven't updated the source in a year and a half:  and the SSL certificate for their domain is invalid.

If you are talking about a large amount you could look at Genesis Trading ( They will do same day wire transfers (so depending on your bank it may have an incoming fee). I am not sure what the minimum is but I would have to guess like $10,000 or more.
Edit: Just checked and the minimum is 25 BTC, found on this page:

Hardware wallets fill a need and they are *a* solution to *some* problems. However I believe with the dematerialization trend that the common user doesn't want to carry around another portable device any more than they want to carry an MP3 player in the left pocket and a phone in the right. I just don't see mass adoption of bitcoin for consumer payments if the normal use case is managing another device.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:28:08
That is probably just laziness. I would assume that a good underwriter would treat it just like if you sold stock or your stamp collection, by making you provide some sort of proof that it was your property and someone didn't loan you the Bitcoin. Proof would be something like a record of when you bought the Bitcoin.

I wanted to note that on point  it could actually be for way more than 5 smart contracts. The 21 pool could subsidize it's own hardware and include incredibly low (or zero) fee transactions from it's clients.

His follow up was a bit over the top. However lenders are very cautious about sources of funds because they don't want to you to take a second loan (that way they have sole claim to the property if you default). Had you been buying in cash it would have been a different situation. I am not defending the practice, just pointing out what the underwriter is looking for.

Basically the 21 Bitcoin Computer is a Raspberry Pi with additional hardware attached. The additional hardware is an ASIC miner for bitcoin (an integrated circuit that is built just for bitcoin mining). The additional hardware may contain some other features.
In addition what they are marketing is a "full stack". It appears they have a custom Linux distro running on the Raspberry Pi. It also appears that the combination of the ASIC hardware and the software running on the Raspberry Pi is going to allow the device to participate in an ecosystem they have developed. So basically you plug it in and you have a full node, some mining capability, and the software to start developing.
I have tried to keep the description as objective as possible. The truth is we don't have a lot of details yet, and expect more will follow over the coming weeks.
As far as duplicating it goes, it is true that you could get a Raspberry Pi and use it to control a bitcoin miner that you purchase separately (lots of examples of this on the internet). And if you are trying to just mine for a profit this is probably going to get you more "power" (you still aren't going to make a profit, but that is another discussion). The 21 Bitcoin Computer is not marketed to compete with the raw power of bitcoin miners. It is marketed to provide a full environment for developers to build things on.
**TLDR;** The 21 Bitcoin Computer is targeting developers as a development kit. Bitcoin miners like the AntMiner are targeting hobbyists who just want to mine.
*Edit:* Thought it might be a good place to add some of my opinion. This is based on following the space for some time, as well as people like Balaji Srinivasan. I feel the 21 computer is just a very early version of what they envision. They have to start somewhere and have to start getting the hacker community engaged in their stack. I believe they are on to something and as a hacker myself I have pre-ordered two of the "computers".

Bravo, this is simpler than anything I could think of. I think replacing poker chips with dollars (they have serial numbers) or a precious metal would make the initial idea easier to grasp, but I wonder if that association would be bad in the long run as a first impression?

This was very direct and honest feedback, and I appreciate that. I cannot say I fully understand nor appreciate the implications of what Bitcoin is going to do for humanity. I feel it would be naive to say I fully understood it. I do however recognize it as one of the greatest disruptive technologies ever. And it is also my opinion that it is greatly underestimated by nearly everyone. It has the potential to do more for the advancement of freedom than the Internet did, and that is a tall order.
Technology can’t be good or bad, it is a tool. People have built amazing things with just a hammer, but that same tool can be used to bash skulls in. GPS technology can get me to the nearest hospital while I am on vacation or it can guide an ICBM into a village full of people. It is up to us as humanity to choose how we are going to leverage the inevitable progress of tech. I for one look to the future with a smile and a sense of responsibility as one of the many.

* This "service" has no contact details.
* The reddit account was created today.
* The domain name was registered six days ago.
* The site is hosted at Namecheap, meaning it is probably paid for in bitcoin.
Chances of this being a scam are very high. Even if it is not a scam it is being hosted in a place where it can be more easily compromised and/or monitored.

A few reasons. I have some proofs of concept that I want to build that would be easier if I had two independent devices (communicating with each other). Also when I am tinkering with hardware I find often that I have something I want to keep for a little while or show off, simultaneously having a new idea. If they were cheaper I probably would have gotten more. It is worth noting most of my current ideas involve devices and IoT applications. If I just wanted to develop connected to my computer I may have settled for one.
Edit: Grammar :/

@_date: 2015-09-30 02:04:04
I just took a look at the site in question. Without a doubt this is a either a ponzi, or just an outright scam.
Try to withdrawal some of your bitcoin in small amounts, they *may* let it go through hoping that you are just testing to make sure withdrawals work before putting more in.
How do I know it is a scam? First they claim to give you 3.6% daily interest. I can just stop at that point. But continuing down the rabbit hole; They are hiding behind an anonymous domain registration. They don't list a single member of the management team. The list goes on.
Sorry and hope you get some back.
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:48:50
I wouldn't call it spam so much as I would call it a SCAM. Basically he wants to con you into sending him irreversible Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin is sent no person or government in the world can reverse it. In exchange he would probably trick people into accepting a check (takes time to bounce) or even things like PayPal (probably from a stolen account and PayPal will take it back).
They are trying to play on peoples greed. Greed can make people do really irrational things on impulse. In this case he is hoping you will rush to "take advantage of this too-good-to-be-true offer".
If you fall for something like this at best you will be out the money, at worst you could even be prosecuted for facilitating money laundering or some other financial "crime".
Hope that helps, cheers!

I feel it is really bad practice to allow users to create brain wallets by their own password. There are many of examples of this ending badly. There are groups of people that build farms for the sole purpose of cracking brain wallets (sort of like a "brain wallet mine").
Depending on what you are trying to do you should look into BIP39, which is a mnemonic code that can generate deterministic keys. The BIP is here:  .
This can be done in Python using:  .
Going this route also adds other benefits like being able to have many addresses, not just a single address that is reused.

Powerful and humbling thought indeed. 
When I try to consider the value of the internet it is difficult to even find a logical starting point. It would be naive to just try and add up capital in all "internet companies". The internet has not only radically enhanced every single industry in the world. It has also done more for freedom than any other event, belief, or movement in the history of mankind.
The internet is a big part of the exponential suite we must employ to continue our civilization. This makes the internet priceless. I also believe another large part of this suite is what you call the internet of value. Thus I would say that the internet of value will adhere to the same exponential trajectory that the internet has.
In short; trying to value the internet today is just as hard as it was to envision its growth in the mid 1900's, and the "blockchain breakthrough" mirrors that.
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:32:27
Thanks for taking the time to reply.


My personal opinion is that there is immense potential in the ability for value to be exchanged between nodes (devices). Although it may not be a perfect example the reason I used the ability to send an SMS is because it is something I have personally ran into recently. If all I want is for my IoT device to be able to send me an SMS notification I have two options. First I can embed a cellular antenna and SIM card into the device, this means a service plan is going to have to be setup for every device (just like signing up for a cell phone). Second I can leverage a third party such as Twilio, that requires an account with a credit card to be manually setup for each device. These are both fine for one off hacks but horrible for consumers expecting technology to be plug and play. Instead if the device can just simply leverage any service provider in the marketplace and pay for it itself, then it removes a massive amount of friction. Email is the same story, we live in a world of spam so for me to get my IoT product to send an email I need to provide it access to a centralized trusted SMTP server. All it takes is one bad actor to reverse engineer the device and send spam through it and then BAM my centralized SMTP server is blacklisted and every IoT product I sold losses the ability. If instead my device can say "Hey Google, please send this email for me, and here is the half a cent payment you require" it is a win!


I am not really sure what approach to take in answering this. If you think that this is either a miner, or the end product, then I believe we have a difference in opinion. My opinion is that this is a development kit so that the doers can start hacking services and products together. It is like saying that the first computers that took up an entire building worth of space are idiotic because we already have paper and pens to do math on, and those paper and pens cost pennies not millions. I agree that $400 doesn't make this ready for every IoT device, and I agree that you are not going to be able to buy this and plug it in, stand back, and make money.
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:24:33
Welcome to Bitcoin. I will try to answer you as simple as possible.
Your wallet keeps track of all your addresses. As you generate new addresses it keeps track of the old ones. So if someone sends Bitcoin to an address you generated previously, then that is fine. Or if they send to the address multiple times that is fine as well. The "balance" you see in your wallet app is showing the sum of all the addresses in your wallet. So your wallet may say you have 5 BTC but behind the scenes it is really 3 BTC on one address and 2 BTC on another. This is really what a wallet is doing, managing all your addresses for you.
As far as for donations. The simplest way is to just to publish one single address that everyone can see. But because everyone is using the same address, anyone can see every donation that has been sent to it. If you are ok with it, and many people are, then go for it. You could even change it manually from time to time if you would like.
As far as I know the only simple way to be able to give different addresses to different people would be to use a third party online "wallet" like Coinbase. They give the ability to add a nice button to your page that takes care of everything for you. They also have an Android app. ***The drawback here is that you don't control your Bitcoin directly until you withdraw it from Coinbase.*** At any time Coinbase, just like a bank, can decide to lock your account, they can get hacked, go out of business. This goes against the spirit of what Bitcoin is.
No matter what you do make sure you are familiar with how to backup and restore the wallet you are using. If your phone gets lost or destroyed you don't want to lose your Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2015-09-27 23:44:22
Nice find! At a first read through this service seems they are getting it right. Great job Stampery team :)
It is very nice to see they have separated Bitcoin from the end user. The problem I always had trying to get people to use other solutions (like proofofexistence.com) is that they have to set up to buy Bitcoin, manage it, give access and training to employees to use the Bitcoin. This may sound easy to us "techs" but in a real business this is a lot.
I also like how they created a very easy to comprehend service by calling them "stamps".
The only flaw I would see from a business perspective is that they must be able to pivot VERY quickly. As use of Bitcoin grows they will just be a middle man and easy to cut out by implementing "stamp" support directly into services (like an email client, Dropbox, or even the camera app on your phone).
@_date: 2015-09-24 03:12:30
Thanks for that, I think I will just test it out and see.
@_date: 2015-09-29 08:19:18
There is no reason to import them into a wallet.
Managing private keys directly is usually discouraged. Many things can go wrong, and many people (even advanced developers) have lost bitcoin this way. I would recommend looking into something like  .
If you insist on doing this manually at the very least make sure you test your process. For example send a small amount to one of your offline keys and practice bringing it online.
@_date: 2015-09-27 04:50:47
I find it admirable that people want to reduce their carbon footprint. As a race we all need to strive to find better balance with this beautiful planet, our home that we can't possibly live without.
I also encourage you to take a few steps back and look at the bigger picture of it. When I did that I thought of two things. First I thought of how Bitcoin is direct, cutting out countless middlemen. All of those middlemen have to drive to work, run heat or AC, use electricity in their offices, executives to fly around on private jets. A quick Google search told me VISA employed more than 8,000 people directly in 2008. That doesn't include all the staff at banks (call centers, compliance departments). To get the real carbon spent on a transaction you would need to account for many more things. You may possibly even include things like printing and shipping plastic cards and the extra receipt paper it takes to print duplicates for stores to retain a signed copy.
The second thing I thought of is how we are shifting from burning fossil fuels to more renewable resources on a global scale. In the decades to come energy is going to become more abundant and much cleaner. To me this is not a theory but a fact. If you wanted to start your own research on this a great place would be to read Abundance by Peter Diamandis &amp; Steven Kotler. If you haven't read it yet prepare for your mind to be blown.

This, I would HIGHLY recommend in the future you do not play with the private keys. Instead a better course of action would be to just send from one wallet to the new wallet. When users start playing with private keys it opens up many things that could go wrong.
To fix the problem you already have, if I was you, I would send my Bitcoins to a brand new wallet and then start over. The reason being is depending on what wallet software you use it is a good chance that it wasn't tested heavily against manually managing private keys. You could have bugs later (like say maybe the address you imported doesn't get backed up with the rest of the addresses).
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:49:29
Don't really understand your comment.

History repeats itself.
Some decision makers in financial institutions think they are being smart by building a proprietary solution behind a big wall. First time they hear about Bitcoin they just chuckle. Once they begin to see the value they want to extract what makes it great and profit on it. I would even be so bold as to say this is an ancient pattern of mankind, to extract and exploit wherever possible.
Eventually these new networks will give away just like they did to TCP/IP.

What you are experiencing is the tightening grip of capital controls. It is getting even worse in other parts of the world. For example I spend time living in Poland and with the local currency PLN you can walk into a bank and withdrawal/deposit as much as you want, just with a debit card (chip and pin) and not a single question. As soon as you touch a Euro, lord have mercy on you, more paperwork than buying a car.
It is my personal belief this is only going to get worse before it gets better. Bitcoin as a tool has the potential to help reform all monetary policy, including this. It is a real shame pioneers like Circle are taking this approach, and to me it only adds them to the ship of traditional banks headed straight for an iceberg.
Currently capital controls are only providing an inconvenience to most people, and they are putting up with it. Wait for negative interest rates to hit and then I believe you will start to see an uproar.

It is a mixture of two problems. First it is your governments (federal, state, local) requiring an obnoxious invasion of your privacy to simply trade freely with other citizens. Then on top of this it is Coinbase being overly accommodating because it has good lawyers. Those good lawyers point out that the many agencies would love to shut them down for their interest groups.
We need to reach a place where we don't have to ask for permission to participate in commerce. They can no longer control knowledge or information, meaning ideas are impossible to stop. One of the last things they have to hold onto is complete control of our money.
Posts like this represent the fact that citizens are reaching a point where they are sick of it. As more join this crowd we will naturally start regaining control of our own prosperity. It needs to be our economy.

The idea of online social networks was the idea, Friendster was an implementation, so was MySpace, so is Facebook.
Anyone being able to buy personal copies of media or record straight from the broadcast, was an idea, betamax was an implementation.
While a particular implementation of any great idea will eventually become the "winner" (at least for that period of time, I don't see VHS tapes at Walmart), a truly great idea cannot be stopped.
The idea of financial emancipation is old. Bitcoin is the current best implementation of it. As technology improves that idea will continue to get better. Even Bitcoin itself will continue to evolve or die away to another implementation.

I strongly disagree with SMS 2fa being more secure. With SMS (or voice call) you have risk of your cellular account being hijacked. You have risk if the third party they use for sending messages being compromised. It has happened both academically and in the wild where someone convinces a cellular carrier to switch phones or transfer a number.
I personally prefer app based TOTP and servicea like Gmail specifically have the ability to turn off SMS backups because of security concerns.

Since the CEO of Coinbase is asking for opinions I have a few.
First for you directly I would say you may consider some business advice. Dragging your $300MM+ companies reputation into a political power struggle within a FOSS community is probably not an advisable choice. I have a feeling that those with a financial interest in your company would feel the same. Your job to them is to go unicorn, and liquidate back into their funds. I understand you are passionate about this, but choosing a side in something like this, and backing a political figure publicly (Roger Ver) is risky with little chance of reward.
Try and take a step back and take a look at this from the other side's shoes. I was here for the great XT raids and saw the way the community was attacked. Discussion needs to happen within the community but as with any centralized forum the centralized moderation needs to take action. I feel that it wasn't handled well in PR terms, and I have expressed that to the moderation team. Ask yourself what Theymos's motivation is and what Ver's motivation is, explore different ideas. Have conversations with the brilliant engineers on both sides of the block size debate, don't let your hand get held by one or the other. Encourage conversation between the developers, don't go out and try and strong arm a solution through using Coinbase's power without natural consensus.
One of my favorite things is coming up with analogies. How many times has the USA picked a group in a territory it thought could do a better job, and support/arm it. How many times has that worked out?

I understand pressure from customers and third parties. But I don't see how paying doesn't just make it worse. It either shows them you will pay, thus they can continue (they have zero incentive to stop). Or it tells other criminals the piggy bank is open.

I feel Python was a great choice for many reasons, one big one being the ease of when the libraries become open source.
I also believe the RPi was a great choice for a controller of the MVP and to build out the libraries. Producing ASICs and trying to solve lower level issues like mining that pays in a steady stream rather than sporadically, marketplaces, off-chain transactions (micro) and payment channels, is enough work. Using a tried and tested RPi as the first consuming device removed a lot problems to solve.

I assume you sold coins, and they are going to be taxed as long-term capital gains (assets held longer than a year). If you are in the USA you can put anything you want when filing your taxes. You don't have to show proof ahead of time. The issue of proof is only if you get audited. Normally you would just show proof of when you obtained the asset. In your case do you still have the private key(s) from 2012 that you used for mining? I would think that would satisfy an auditor, showing that you mined X coins in 2012 and you later sold &lt;= X coins.
However if you don't have this, perhaps showing you controlled that many coins at least a year before selling them (by proving you have the private key) would do the trick. And if you can't even do this and get audited a good attorney would be the first step, or of course coughing up the difference between short and long-term gains.

As I mentioned before, I built this simply as a demonstration, as a proof of concept, not as a business.
Agreed spam is the best case scenario regarding abuse. Companies like Google (it is fairly easy to get a Gmail with a full Google Voice number over TOR with no personal details) already deal with it. I have worked with Nexmo before and when creating a new account I made my intentions clear when being asked. Yes with high volume or gripes I am sure it would get the axe. To do this on a proper scale you would need to not use a middleman.
As far as zero confirmation transactions, I would debate that with you. I am perfectly comfortable accepting them in this case.

Hello welcome to the wild world of Bitcoin!
Bitcoin provides the opportunity for great financial freedom, often described as becoming your own bank. The danger of this is you are responsible for your own security. This is true if you keep the bitcoin in your own wallet. This is also true if you give your bitcoin to a third-party like Coinbase.
Keeping your bitcoin in a normal Coinbase wallet is as good as an IOU. They (and those they are subordinate to) have control of your bitcoin. You are just hoping that when you come to collect the IOU that it is honored.
Keeping your bitcoin in a Coinbase "Vault" can provide a bit more security because they do not have direct control over your bitcoin. If they closed tomorrow you would still be able to control your bitcoin.
I would recommend you start here:  And I personally would use a service like Coinbase to purchase or sell bitcoin, but keep bitcoins in a wallet I control. Depending on your level of confidence and the amount you are investing one great solution today is a hardware wallet like Trezor:  .

Welcome I have some experience in car sales.
If I understand your post correctly, you are disappointed that a customer paying in bitcoin is more likely to publicly announce how much they paid for the vehicle. And this can be a problem because you charge different people different amounts. You don't want Bob (that just went with sticker price) to know that Jerry paid 15% less. Also if Alice negotiated a good price you don't want Sara coming in from social media expecting to start at that price. Keeping people happy and referring is much easier when everyone thinks they were given a great deal. I am not shaming on this practice, you are in business to make money, but let us just be straight forward about the issue.
To achieve what you want you could use a bit more sleezy of tactic and suggest to new buyers that they got such a great deal to please keep it private or you would be out of business. You could also stop accepting customers paying in bitcoin.
However as the transparency of Bitcoin style currencies becomes more and more popular you may have to evaluate your business practices. It may not be feasible for you now but in the future maybe you could move toward a pricing model that has a transparent "sticker" that fairly shows invoice plus your take. Part of that would be you have don't have room to negotiate as much because you use fair pricing. I remember buying a VW about 10 years ago in Virginia from a dealership that had a policy like this, and it is why I picked them. They clearly showed the invoice with what they paid for the car, and what they were making. They made it clear to potential buyers that this was below the advertised rates for all the dealerships that rely on more of a sucker model. Talking with one of the managers he told me they were selling so many more cars using this approach that it was way more profitable than trying to squeeze a few thousand more out of an occasional sale.
An early adopter of Bitcoin is more likely to respond to an honest open system, and you may find that you can have an advantage in attracting them. It is the way of future and perhaps you can find a way to get your dealership into a great early advantage. Other ways you could cater to this crowd is things like storing proof of existence contracts on the blockchain (very easy to do), or offering bitcoin rewards for referrals (this is a very close community).

One of the main reasons is privacy. Some people don't want to give their bank account, social, copy of ID, address, and explain every dollar to a company like Circle or Coinbase. So instead they meet in person and can exchange cash for bitcoin with very little risk. It may sound backwards but in person is actually more anonymous.

My best possible explanation for what the issue is can be found in my post  . Also the comments have a lot of discussion.
Someone (or group) is deliberately causing the attack, by exploiting a flaw. Whether developers using bitcoin or the bitcoin protocol itself is to blame is open for debate. My opinion is transaction malleability issues should be addressed (cautiously) in the protocol. However developers building on bitcoin should be aware that unconfirmed transaction ids can change. Transaction malleability is not a new issue, and any developers in the space should have already been aware of it, and building accordingly. Again these are my own personal opinions.

You are correct, I assumed average vehicles not high end customized ones. I understand you have a more complex situation where financial privacy is preferred. One thing I just thought of is if I had that amount of bitcoin I wouldn't want to the world to know and be a target of criminals. Not sure how you would bring that up to a customer though. Maybe just a simple suggestion that sharing a bitcoin transaction ID or address publicly gives everyone a direct look into their financial privacy, including the tax man and other criminals ;) Or maybe a joke in passing "Man we had one guy buy a ____ with bitcoin and he was so excited he posted the transaction ID on Twitter, he didn't understand it was like posting his bank statement".

I would say this is happening to a lot of people and services, yes.
I can't speak for the challenges that developers are facing while trying to mitigate the headaches this causes, or to why they chose to build things the way they did. I can speak to the fact that hindsight is 20/20, and building any application has a lot of complexity to account for.

My technical data is just a basic technical understanding of how CF works. I suppose the CF site would be the reference.
The reason they need unencrypted traffic is they work in the top layers. If they were only routing traffic they would only be working on say the transport layer and wouldn't need to push through SSL (sitting on the application layer).
They work on the higher layers to provide a more robust service. For example they can:
* Sanitize GET and POST data to not include things like SQL Injection attempts
* Show a user a CAPTCHA instead of the resource they requested to make sure they are not a bot.
* A big part of their offering is Apps that work by modifying your content to add some sort of functionality, you can see that here: 
Hope that explains the need.

The database itself is encrypted, and if you think it is worth the convenience then you might go for it. Lots of people do this, I just feel it can be a weakness.
Another option is to use a USB flash drive (they make ones that have a dual adapter to also plug into Android via USB OTG).

If you are asking if the attack is still going on, and if you may run into the problem again, the answer is yes. The same thing may happen again (it is about a 50/50 chance on each transaction). This will be true until developers, like the ones at freebitco.in, take into account that unconfirmed transaction ids may change.

Sorry couldn't find that quote.
I was only making a case they outsource network security. But to be more clear: Coinbase hands all their network traffic over to Cloudflare, including the keys to decrypt it. The majority of major Bitcoin services do the same. I see several risks in this. The first being it presents a single huge treasure chest to criminals. The second is it provides a really easy place for three letter agencies to freely mine data without even worrying about encryption. The tin foil hat came off for this with Snowden, it is why Google had to start encrypting internal traffic as well. It is why companies like Apple are encrypting phones by default, technology is fighting back.


I wouldn't make an argument that rolling your own would be better. This needs an even bigger step back. We need to start modernizing services and even the Internet itself into a decentralized model. Going to the bank and handing them your gold so they can give you a paper voucher is full of flaws and outdated. Yet here we are with Bitcoin and people are going to Coinbase and giving them their bitcoin. We need a different approach than trying to build a stronger fortress, the news proves this every day.


You don't need an investigation. If a company uses Cloudflare they have handed access over to their unencrypted traffic, period. Yes you could mitigate some attack vectors by using things like Authy (but the joke in that is they are also using Cloudflare). When you setup TOTP (2fa) and the service gives you that QR code to scan, anyone that had access to that can generated codes forever. And guess who has access to that? Cloudflare! So in this case even if Coinbase switched to only using open source Google Authenticator it wouldn't protect.
@_date: 2015-10-02 03:29:54
You make a good point about the reason for needing DDoS protection. I have used CloudFlare on projects, and it is usually after a DDoS. It is cheaper than other solutions, and much cheaper than trying to build a network yourself to mitigate attacks. However that doesn't change the fact that pooling together under a centralized service like CF trades it for a different kind of risk.
It is a good point about using Tor, I am pleased you guys have thought this through already. I will add a note on my original post.
@_date: 2015-10-02 05:27:57
Here is a nice article about the current malleability attack, it is what you are seeing: 
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:32:30
Haha sort of like a bitcoin mafia, pay for protection against us. I think a bunch of groups are attempting a similar business model but based on denial of service attacks against services.
I don't think such a service would do well because anyone could copy it with very little code, so it would be too many wiseguys trying to collect. Additionally this issue, although annoying, can be solved directly by developers.
@_date: 2015-10-02 02:52:05
*Additional thoughts because I wanted to keep the post short:*
I only tested the services that popped into my mind, if you want to check any service you can search on  . If they are using CloudFlare it will come up in the "Name Server" section.
This problem affects more than bitcoin. Effectively with the shift towards SaaS many companies are trusting centralized entities like CloudFlare because it is easy and very cost effective. The financial incentive of bitcoin makes the situation even more alarming.
Just a few years ago (2012) a malicious group, UGNazi, gained administrative access to CloudFlare just for the purpose of defacing the website 4chan.org. The only incentive was to redirect a website to a Twitter page for laughs. Now the incentive is probably in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
An inside job would be even more probable than an outside attacker against CloudFlare.

As a startup guy myself I think an even bigger step needs to be taken back, and we need to address reworking the internet into a more decentralized platform that has natural protection against things like DDoS attacks. Such an attack is possible because data has to be centralized to a single place to run an internet service, and the solution we employ is just to centralize to another place.
Things like BitTorrent and Tor (at least with onion sites) have already taken great first steps. In addition there are many projects working on solutions to the centralization of information.

Please please please don't teach people to rely on the insurance. It is a false sense of security. Just saying "they are insured" is irresponsible. Here is their support page on it:
 
It covers a very limited set of scenarios. And even for those it includes a force majeure clause.
The main issues a user has to worry about are:
* A computer virus stealing your credentials, not covered by the insurance
* Being phished, not covered by the insurance
* Coinbase going bankrupt, insurance does not cover insolvency
* Coinbase funds being seized by a government agency (in many cases this is theft but again not covered by insurance)
You can mitigate some of this scenarios by using Coinbase's Vault offering. However you still have to pay attention to your end of security (phishing, malicious software) the same.

Currently the majority of transactions are reused addresses. Here is a chart (sorry I don't remember the source): 
It is considered bad practice to reuse an address, because it has the potential to make it more traceable in the future. But it is my opinion that if our goal is anonymous transactions we need to address that in different ways. Even without reuse it isn't hard to track sources. For example the other day I was digging into the payouts of Purse.io (after the email compromise). Each time they process a withdrawal they send the change to a new address. It isn't difficult at all to follow that chain and tell they are all from the same source. It may make it a tad bit harder for manual reading of the blockchain by a person but any simple programmed script can put these together in a snap. So I can easily put together a pool and tell that bitcoin came from Purse.io.
Additionally some use cases are still difficult without reusing addresses. For example as an average user if I want to put a donation address up anywhere it is way more complex to build a safe system to generate individual addresses. The easiest safe way, and the way I would recommend in that scenario, is to setup a Trezor or offline wallet and paste a public address wherever you want.
I wouldn't go crazy over never reusing an address. If you can use wallets or practices that easily avoid it, then great, but if not it's fine. Bitcoin, as it is currently built, is not designed for anonymous transactions. It is actually the opposite, it is designed for every transaction to be 100% public. Things that are being layered on top of Bitcoin like Coinjoin *help* with anonymity, but to truly achieve that it will need to be addressed at the protocol level itself.
Bitcoin is hard enough for new users as it is, trying to impose more "rules" on them for a supposed benefit is just making the curve harder. I disagree with those in this community that tell new users "ppfffff never reuse addresses, you are hurting us all, oh you don't have to put one public address up, get a server with PHP". Imagine if the dealer at Toyota told a potential customer "Oh the car runs ok, but never use the stock firmware on this, go buy a flasher and flip these specific bits and that is how to use it properly".

Read through everything, very well put together. They have put together tutorials that teach developers the foundations of bitcoin and get them setup with a VM to start developing on. This is all without the computer. It seems later they will make a case of why their computer is then worth it. This puts a lot of the negativity to rest that the computer is just an overpriced full node.
Some quotes that may hint at what is next:




@_date: 2015-10-04 05:52:52
Yes this was because of the current transaction malleability attack. My description of what that means is here:  .
Your transaction did go through but under a different transaction id. Here are the two transactions (they are the same, and that is why only one went through):
* 
* 
So what you need to do is contact freebitco.in because their software didn't recognize the other transaction id.

I wouldn't go so far as calling it a business relationship. They asked what I was doing and how they could, and I told them. They are not going to risk their business over a couple Euros that I provide. If I was building this as a business I wouldn't rely on them.
It is a higher risk during a malleability attack if you accept a zero confirmation transaction that spends outputs from another zero confirmation transaction. This is easily mitigated by putting a rule saying zero-confirmations will only be accepted if they are spending UTXOs that have n confirmations (so basically no "chains of zero confirmations").
As far as attackers are concerned, if they successfully orchestrate a double spend attack the most they are going to make off with is the few euros I keep on the pre-paid Nexmo account. If I were to build this into a more robust service I would also get more advanced like limiting the number of zero-confirmation transactions by IP, then the attacker would also have to facilitate the use of many IP addresses. In the end the complexity to pull it off wouldn't be worth the few Euros in value.
Thanks for your kind words, I do appreciate the discussion and not wanting people to get burnt, we all have to be extra careful in this space!

I am personally not a fan of this. It does great to secure it against individuals or private organizations. But it does a horrible job protecting against law enforcement.
Civil asset forfeiture is basically a free pass to seize the assets of anyone they pick. You may think "Yeah but I have nothing to hide, or any reason to get law enforcement's attention", but sadly others thinking the same have been caught off guard. No matter what "crime" you are being pursued for it is always in your favor if they are going to have to go through actual due process to remove your property from you (you know with things like a jury). 
Of course you could mitigate this by encrypting the mnemonic stored in the vault.

Basically the transaction was broadcast to the network twice. One has 38 confirmations and the other has zero.

I built this simply as a demonstration, as a proof of concept, that machines can exchange value without borrowing the identity of a person. Something I could show to colleagues as a demonstration. I priced it high and if I caught much heat for it I would simply shut it down. I never expect it to even cover the cost of the .io domain. A spammer has much better options than this.
As far as your question of what happens when _______ comes after you or a customer for __________.  Any business can sit down and dream up an endless flow of these. We have so much bureaucracy and regulations on so many levels, entire law offices can't even be an expert on it all. The best you can do is acquire counsel and be an honest person.
If you wanted to turn this into a profitable business model some big changes would need to be made, and some challenges would need to be overcome (like any disruptive startup). One is to price it more competitively, currently it is more than 10x what a traditional gateway would cost. Also you would need to not use a third-party like Nexmo, that have very low risk tolerance. Spam is easy to go after because you are advertising something, and that something can be tracked back (and filtered, in the US if you message  to 500 cell phones you are going to find that network operators will simply start dropping the messages, they want you to go with a short code for that). Harassment would be the difficult one to address. Off the top of my head one way to mitigate that would be when someone replies to an SMS the service could reply with details about what the message is, where to report abuse, and how to permanently unsubscribe from the entire server ("STOP").

This is a decent rundown:  .
The transaction hash (called the transaction id) is a hash of the entire transaction, including the signature. If you signed the transaction after it was hashed, you couldn't put the signature into the transaction because the hash would change.
Of course other approaches could have been taken back when this was implemented. I wasn't present nor have I taken the time to properly evaluate other methods. I can say however as a developer it is IMPOSSIBLE difficult to foresee every possible scenario.

I am not sure of Shapeshift's exact privacy practices. I know that (CEO) is a privacy advocate. I know that the service does not collect personal details in order to use it (no email / name for example). It is also based in Switzerland, a place that is usually praised for privacy practices (especially compared to the USA). This is a model that I am a huge fan of, and I believe it will become the norm in the future.
However please be aware that for network protection Shapshift uses a service based in the jurisdiction of the USA. Meaning that your interaction with the site is routed through a company that could be doing it's own data logging without the knowledge of Shapeshift (even with SSL encryption).

It is because of the malleability attack:  .
**Edit:** I wrote up an ELI5 to try and explain the issue better: 
Basically someone is exploiting a "vulnerability" of the network by rebroadcasting transactions with a different transaction id. A lot of bitcoin software relies on the assumption that the transaction id will not change once sent. The bitcoin transaction is still successful and only one of the transactions will be accepted. The attacker is not able to modify any data in the transaction, just the transaction id itself.
Most users will need to contact the service they were using (for example your game) and have them straighten it out, until their developers can update to detect and handle duplicate transactions.
Hope that helps.

I know that it is common belief that Wall Street is going to rocket the price, having been hearing that for a long time. It will for sure make the market deeper, but speculation doesn't guarantee upwards action.

If you send your bitcoin to Gemini, you no longer control it. In Bitcoin whoever holds the private key is the owner. You are trusting them to make an entry in their private database that you deposited n bitcoin, and you are trusting later that they will give you back n bitcoin.
The real question is risk assessment. If you are looking to day trade bitcoin you have to evaluate the risk of losing your bitcoin completely vs the benefit of what your profit may be. If you are not looking to day trade bitcoin then you have no reason to take the risk of giving your bitcoin to Gemini.
You mentioned Coinbase, and that is a similar risk assessment. What do you need Coinbase for? If it is to buy and sell bitcoin then minimize your risk by immediately transferring bitcoin you buy back into your own control (a full wallet) and only deposit when you are selling.

Ok perfect, usually with an ELI5 I tend to stoop as low as I can.
I guess it is because transactions are a neat package to transmit across the network. If you removed the signature you would have to transmit both the transaction and the signature. I am not an expert but I believe these sort of ideas have been explored, and the problem is possibly introducing other vulnerabilities such as the possibility for a signature replay attacks.

Google could accept bitcoin in Play. The problem is refunds are hard to handle, currently if I buy an app on Google Play and then don't like it and uninstall it just refunds my CC. With Bitcoin you can't return to the sending address because of services like Coinbase that use massive shared wallets. It would be great to see something added to the protocol where wallets can specify a return address similar to email's reply-to field.

[BIP-0062]( deals with malleability, and could probably give more insight, I have never researched it that deeply. For this particular malleability technique the major miners and pools could filter it I suppose.
This isn't the only source of malleability that is known. Another approach would be for developers to assume that unconfirmed transaction ids are subject to change. This would make wallet and other software more adaptable if newer malleability techniques are found in the future. And regardless of what patches get applied to the reference client I would argue developers should still do this.
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:02:13
It is mostly likely because of transaction malleability, basically transactions are getting broadcast twice, but only one will ever go through. Some wallets show this as a double spend. I wrote an ELI5 a few weeks ago:

If the individual on Bitcointalk.org that is claiming credit is actually behind it, then I would say the incentive is attention.
However the incentive doesn't really matter. It is happening because it can. Call it Murphy's law if you wish.

It seems that the latter is currently the better approach.

Agreed in the duping. It is also a possibility for bitcoin to end up the same, I see similarities. People didn't want the risk and hassle with carrying gold around, so they pooled it together in a central place. Many are doing the same thing with bitcoin, pooling it for convenience and perceived security (Coinbase &amp; Circle are good USA examples). If this trend keeps up it will only be a mater of time before more bitcoin exists off-chain than on (if it doesn't already).

The way we regulate has not evolved, and it can't keep up. Regulation still follows a linear path, and by the time an exponential technology even registers on its radar it is way too late. This is the beauty of this revolution.
By the time oppressive governments could even define the Internet it had already set information free. Today some are still trying to censor and control it, but it is pointless. Torrent technology saw the most resistance but it is still flourishing. Encryption is another battle and somehow centralized authorities think they can control it.
This same scenario is going to apply to money. Bitcoin technology is taking an old linear idea and hooking it to the exponential train. Economic wealth is going to leave the arena of centralized control, regulation, and manipulation. By the time it is fully understood it will be too late. Sure some entities will fight, some "bans" will happen, but the innovation has been set into motion.
Eventually when the regulators having nothing left to regulate our approach to governance is going to need an overhaul as well.

This is not a new idea, it is an idea that has been toyed with throughout history. I applaud the team over at CryptoVoter for their effort, but I personally feel it will not work out.
The biggest issue you have is every Bitcoin user does not have the time to become versed enough to provide guidance. When the founding fathers of the United States of America came up against the same realization they decided they would create a system where they could take turns leaving their normal lives and focusing on representing the desires and needs of their communities. **In a world of specialization every participant of a system can't be an expert on every specialty that affects that system.**
Asking every person that has Bitcoin "Do you think the block size limit should be raised" is already misleading. It is like putting to vote "Do you think cars should get better gas mileage". When whatever regulation is going to provide that better gas mileage has a lot of complex variables that would take many hours to study to make an informed vote in your best interest. Another analogy would be asking my Grandmother to vote on increasing the TCP packet size because she has a computer.
The next issue is that in our current ecosystem large amounts of BTC are pooled under operators such as exchanges. This would give them an instant super majority on any topic they wanted to vote on.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-10-02 07:58:18
It is easier if we look at a single transaction, so lets use [this one]( The transaction is creating three outputs:
* One is sending some change back to the original address (1PvcShSF...).
* One is sending 0.0000543 bitcoin to the address 1BURNSogX... 
* One is a special output called OP_RETURN. It is marked as "Unable to detect output address" because that output is not sending bitcoin to a new address. Instead that output is storing a small amount of data in the blockchain. If you scroll to the bottom of the page you can see the data they are storing (starts with OP_RETURN 84e1d2c94...).
Now as far as the address "1BURNSogXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXW3ny2Y", that is a valid bitcoin address. By valid I mean it is acceptable by the protocol. However it is impossible that anyone has the private key to ever use it. Any bitcoin sent to it is gone forever. I know it is impossible for anyone to have the private key because to generate a private key that has that public address would take an incredible amount of computing power. If it were possible the entire security of bitcoin would be broken because you could generate the private key of any public address you wanted. Whoever sent this transaction probably did it on purpose to prove the bitcoin was "burned". Hence using the word "1BURNS" in it.

 of events:
* Several [reports]( surface of Purse.io users having the bitcoin emptied from their account. For each case reported it is the same description: Receive three emails, password reset, confirm withdrawal, withdrawal receipt.
* Purse.io brings the site offline and posts [this blog]( Basically saying that unauthorized password reset emails are being sent out, and all funds are safe. They don't mention the withdrawal confirmations that are being sent out as well.
* They tweet that all user balances are accounted for  and reply to many Reddit comments that all funds are safe.
* About five hours later they restore service
 short investigation
On a [reddit comment]( I got this address from the withdrawal email: 1GsFvMK9PKNYzHFPzT5D4B3SfZ6HN5uamY. The withdrawal did go through to that address. Purse.io uses P2SH addresses (assuming multisig) that sends the change to a new P2SH address after each withdrawal. If you click through that chain you can track over 30 bitcoins that were withdrawn today. With some deeper digging and more unauthorized withdrawal addresses you could account for more.
If Purse.io is claiming that all funds are safe I call that bluff. I wonder how many bitcoins were stolen and if they will be able to cover the loss.
When are customers going to wake up and stop trusting control of their bitcoin to others?
When are entrepreneurs going to catch on? Start building services that don't require user funds to be pooled under insecure practices. And if you think you must store user funds, don't outsource the security to others. *In this case I see that Purse.io is using MailChimp (Mandrill) to send all their emails, CloudFlare with their SSL, Authy for 2fa codes.*

* What was the reason for not including a really basic LCD screen? Or at the very least a few LEDs? I find that most of the time if people buy into the need for a separate hardware device they also want that device to be able to communicate at least basic information back to them. Another reason a basic information display would be awesome is the wow factor. If I have this sitting on my desk and someone comes over and asks about it the "coolness" is even better if it looks like it is doing something.
* How do you plan on competing with companies like 21 Inc. in the long run? The device they are releasing also boasts that it is instantly a full node as soon as it is plugged in. I know for now your price point is the winner but I would predict future versions of the "bitcoin computer" to come down in price.

Cash became successful entering the age of specialization. With specialization participants in the economy can focus on being really good at something, say making hats, and not have to worry about hunting food. In order for this to work though we needed a way to easily exchange value in the economy, a system to be able to redeem that your created hat is worth 5 steaks at a later date. This started with direct barter (give the hat directly for the steaks), to trading objects of scarcity, to evolving into divided pieces of precious metal, and eventually cash.
Moving forward if a crypto currency was to gain enough adoption it could replace the purpose of cash. Although it also presents a lot of new properties that haven't been tested on a grand scale. Such as Bitcoin is deflationary and all modern cash is inflationary.
As far as needing the touch and smell. I think society has already proven that is not necessary. Myself, and the majority of my friends/family hardly ever carry cash, and find it an inconvenience when we need some. Most of the time all that I carry is an ID and debit card.

It is hard to keep up with all of the bitcoin conversations that go on in so many places. However I have not seen any discussion of fixing this or pushing BIP-0062 along on Github, in the mailing lists, or Reddit.

@_date: 2015-11-04 23:43:26
Thanks for engaging. I wouldn't evaluate myself as having a lack of understanding of the situation at all. I also feel you assume that I believe Bitcoin is meant to be anonymous. Bitcoin means different things to different people, but to me it is about freedom from the economic monopolies. It is about absolute transparency of wealth that can't be manipulated by a central authority for their own benefit. It is about removing the power of those that use economic advantage to not only maintain but profit from the inequalities of the world.
I understand banking, and the reality that it is very difficult to plug a Bitcoin onramp into the existing fiat system. To participate in the fiat system you must play close enough to the rules to not end up in orange coveralls. You must also play it safe enough to got get robbed by the recallable nature of fiat transfers.
With that being said Coinbase could have taken a different approach from the point of accepting an ACH and releasing bitcoin. They could have created a platform that didn't rely on them holding complete control of a users bitcoins, encouraging people from their first introduction to Bitcoin to just hand them over to a bank. They could have encouraged and onboarded new comers into the beauty of a system where the bank doesn't control your money. From a technical perspective this could have looked much like Blockchain.info's wallet. And yes BCI has had many issues, but the idea that we don't want access to your money was an attitude I would like to see repeated.
Many of us point newcomers immediately to Coinbase. They could be better custodians of what is possible in a world with Bitcoin.

Edit: Thinking it through I could see a scenario like this: You receive bitcoin from Alice, and then you pay for your coffee with it before it has any confirmations. The coffee house accepts it as it is a valid transaction. Later if it turns out if the bitcoin Alice sent you was confirmed in the duplicate transaction it would invalidate what you gave to the coffee shop, and you would still have all the bitcoin. However for this to be true your wallet would have to support spending unconfirmed outputs, and to the best of my knowledge they usually don't.
I don't feel this would cause a problem. Once the PoS software (wallet) sees the amount was broadcast in a transaction it will confirm it was paid. How it handles the second transaction later may cause some headaches depending on if the wallet developers worked in this scenario or not.
So in short, it is still safe to take zero confirmations for small amounts, and it shouldn't effect your coffee purchase.

I had never seen this before. This is now what I will point people at that have no idea what civil asset forfeiture is.

I see, only option then is to wait for Blockchain.info to work again for you.

This is a very good argument, agreed that four billion can't really support much in the realm of speculation.

I think it is easier to describe "used improperly". Although using something like KeePass provides a lot of convenience it can also increase risk because you are "putting all of your eggs in one basket".
One example is using a short easy to crack master password. The password should be very long, and one you have NEVER used anywhere else before. You could go the extra step and use a combination of password and key file, and keep the key file on an external thumb drive.
Another example is using a third party application with your database in an insecure environment. Great example would be a rooted Android phone with a "KeePass" app from the store. If you are on windows keep antivirus up to date. Don't use KeePass on public or shared computers.
Try and avoid using file sharing or "cloud" services to store your database (Dropbox, Google Drive). To get your passwords someone would need your database plus your password (and hopefully plus your key file), best to make it as hard as possible.
Do NOT store TOTP seeds or any other 2fa recovery data in your database. It really defeats the purpose. I have seen many people doing this, really don't do it.
I could go on but hopefully you get the drift. In conclusion although KeePass gives you a lot, (anything is better than using the same password all over) you have to remain conscious about it and treat it like your Bitcoin keys.

This is a great quote. It doesn't seem radical, it is just the next natural progression.

If you are a developer take a look at  It is a key-value data store where the key is registered on the blockchain, and data is stored off blockchain. The data off blockchain is decentralized and maintained by those running Blockstore Nodes just like Bitcoin. This is what Onename migrated to for blockchain IDs. I have been playing with it and it is very robust. Keep in mind it is new and evolving very fast.

You are correct, I was quick to assume using them for DNS meant using them as a full service, I didn't dig deep enough.
However using incapsula isn't any better. It is still in California and still has the same security issues. You are still trusting with all of your unencrypted network data.
I will update my OP to reflect this.

Usually contacting Reddit admins would be the best way to handle any site wide issues you are having. Posting here as a moderator of a sub reddit that's purpose is to mock is probably not going to get much result. It is more likely it is going to be perceived as trying to instigate problems.

Thanks for answering. The look-ahead seems like the solution for most cases. I guess the worst that could happen is you have to manually tell it to look ahead farther if the need arises.

I applaud most of your comment, those are the right questions to be asking. But to say that because of that it will not happen is like saying the same thing about monarchies. The many will always defeat the few, it may be a slow battle, but it is still true. And technology is giving us more power than ever, piece by piece.

Couldn't agree more. Challenge accepted.

I don't mind entertaining this as one of the contributing factors. I just haven't seen any hard enough evidence. Does anyone have something?
@_date: 2015-10-04 04:59:14
Thanks! I understand the warning. I was actually coding it all (including the "wallet"). Not for use in the real world, but just to expand my comprehension of the underlying mechanics.

I wasn't trying to personally offend you, or the OP. Perhaps I was a bit direct with my comment.
My point was simply topics with titles about the price moving one or two dollars, and speculation about why, will have better reception in the subreddit dedicated to that. In this case it was discussing the exchange spread and speculating it had to do with the Chinese, how is that not market talk?
Notice how this topic is 47% upvoted? I feel directing the OP to a place where people discuss markets is better than letting them continue and wonder why their topics get downvoted.

I would settle for this.

We are both stating opinions :)
