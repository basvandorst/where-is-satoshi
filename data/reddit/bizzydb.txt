I plan on buying in a few days time. Bought in at $125 a while ago, no regrets. You don't lose anything until you sell.

What should I regret? I'm in it for the long run. If the price stays under $80 ill buy a couple in a few days.

I bought two domains yesterday at namecheap via bitpay and my account was funded instantly.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:06:26
Because it was stolen and everyone knew so no one would buy
@_date: 2013-07-21 07:39:21
Yep they funded instantly then I paid from account balance.

That's what I'm thinking. What happens when there's &lt; 1,000 copies of the full blockchain after some years. It'll slowly become a centralized network.

I would have thought 17-18 would have been a larger chunk.
Interesting info, makes me feel special :)

The admin used to be very heavily against Bitcoin but recently did a complete 180 on the issue.

The same guy that tried to sell me his stolen BTC for 50% price :/
@_date: 2013-05-26 16:32:46
I think it was the fact that so many people were interested in purchasing/donating/talking about crypto currencies and the fact that he missed the train on all the &lt;$20 BTC back then.

If Satoshi vanished who owns/runs bitcoin.org? Answer: The Man

I might buy another domain just because now.
