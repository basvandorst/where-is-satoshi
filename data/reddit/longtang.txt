Towards whom, or what is it malicious?  Are you a troll?  What is your major mal-function?  What is with your extreme hostility?  I don't get it. Oh well.  Shrug.

For those of you following along, 
on 1/3/19 at 04:10 am california time, I sent $0.04 all the way to Netherlands, From california:
 into 15SAJHjggM4GiaUz1wYb2Ug7simtenR2Bc  which is owned by BTCKoning in netherlands.
Moments later, BTCKoning, literally a world away, sent that same $0.04 with a very small fee, into 
1L4mPFPBEnpEPjCpdgnsgCJMFXaR9mSFmY  ,  All the way from Netherlands back to California!
I am so impressed with this technology.  It may seem trivial . . . what is 0.04$???  However, IT IS ACTUALLY PRECISELY THAT IT IS SO trivially small, that is has yet unimagined WORLD-CHANGING implications.  Does anyone else see the significance?  We should all be blown away that the fee is less than &lt; 0.9 cents!
thank you!

I see.  Ok.  fair enough that you are trying to look out for the novice.  
I am not trying to trap any novices.  But, I also don't want to baby or kid-glove anyone who wants to be in the space.  This is the real thing.  We are talking about a trustless, open source, borderless, immutable, unmanipulable system of money.  There are no second chances.  If a new comer didn't do their due diligence, a small amount of pain at the very beginning should sober them up real quick.
Let me ask you this way: were you for or against the Vitalec ETH fork, as a do-over?  ETH is complete garbage because of the do-over [early on, ether was hacked and ppl lost a lot of ether.  Cry-babies got their hard fork to get their ether back.  That is a complete illustration of why ether is destined to fail.  It goes to mentality.  Ether does not have the strength of will or conviction].  So, to anyone who is new to the space, welcome.  We will help you learn.  And if the method of our teaching seems unforgiving, believe me, BTC and the real world is ten times more unforgiving.
To FortuitousIdiosn:  thx for clarifying your original comment.  I feel clarified.  Your heart is in the right place.  Thx.

that makes u a blind fool to think living on credit can last forever.  I am not talking about a timing. I am talking about the big picture.  U r a small minded person who is too blind to see simple big picture of 21 trillion borrowed money and think we can just borrow more.  To what end?  Let me ask you this: we can just borrow without end for ever?  Answer me. LOL  laghuable.

that may be true . . . however, in my particular situation, I think KYC is a cost.  Buying any thing from coinbase, or kragen direct has a cost.  My privacy is worth at least some part of the cost. 
The only reason I'd even consider mining is for the privacy which I think I might get.  If there is another way to get anon, I would do that too.  I will be going to btc meets and such.

Hi:  I know what you are saying about the bolivar being different.  
But, the USA is in 21 trillions of debt.  So, it isn't hard to predict that within our life time, the USA will be bankrupt.
So, how can you say that the US$ is not going to be worthless?
I am not being facetious.  I am actually hoping against hope that what I see as so obvious isn't really going to be so.  For, it is a very bleak future.
Do you see a bright future for the $21 trillion of debt?  I mean, doesn't it look like the USA is going to go by way of Sears?  Sears is bankrupt.
thx.
