Overstock CEO is open about his libertarian leanings.

Does Hugh Hendry even know about alt-coins?
Is this why LTC volumes are 2x BTC volumes in China? (for fiat)
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:50:20
I had two coins?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:26:02
Coin competition does not increase productivity of any kind. It just damages confidence in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:28:49
You're correct. It's very negative.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:37:32
Who doesnt.

Yes, and were clients notified? We have other commitments in our life besides reading every bookmarked website.
In case the point is not elucidated clearly enough, Joseph, this entire incident is about mis-communication: between virtex, and their clients, management and staff, retroactive changes, failure to update verification status, etc.

You can pump any precious metal there is. the fact remains - supply of those metals is fixed. 
You cannot fork a metal, but you can fork btc, ltc, whatever.

Only barely anyone is aware of it, and it becomes much easier to trade LTC. Much easier to say, oh look, its the same thing, just cheaper! silver to gold! Than to explain to somebody that a "coin" is divisible to 8 decimal places.
just look at OKCoin volumes, they trade 150 million dollars in volume daily, 3x bigger volume than the biggest BTC exchange in the world, why do you think, because LTC is just so much better than BTC?
The psychological price barrier is real, and you can see the consequences already.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:31:05
Do you still feel the same way about LTC now that its trading between 35-40 dollars?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:03:25
Where did you read that ?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:49:40
How is it slowly starting to seep in? LTC volumes are rising quicker and quicker :/
Now all you need everyone in China to start thinking LTC will catch up with BTC, and watch them pile on.
This cannot end well.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:43:43
It's called LTC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:40:57
I would imagine they'd do it for others as well.

Could you please copy platinums github repo, and fork platinum 2.0 ? You make it sound real easy.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:39:16
Are you accusing me of spreading FUD ?
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:54:38
I made a sizable deposit, nothing huge. Once they withdrew the money from my bank, they began making demands, which is rather bizzare. I prefer to be informed before I deposit any money.
So yes, the money was stuck in the limbo.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:23:41
There is only one gold.
Altcoins will ruin confidence in cryptocurrency, creating viable altcoins is exactly the same as increasing money supply via printing.

largest LTC exchange _in China_, OKCoin, traded 180 million in usd equivalent volume in LTC on Dec 3rd.
BTC China, largest BTC exchange IN THE WORLD, traded 60 million USD equivalent volume in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:43:18
And it has hurt the value already.

Liquidity can grow over time, and then snowball into large enough size.

I was able to withdraw under 3000, a couple of months back, but the account was online-verified.

LATEST UPDATE:
spoke with Joseph David, their CEO. Provided some docs to him while on the call, and he promised to rectify the situation by noon, MST.  Will keep you guys posted.

seizing domains is trivial. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:47:50
So many comments, and not one mentions altcoins.
Do you really think numerous altcoins, include 1 billion market cap LTC does not damage "21 million coins only" myth?
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:05:16
LATEST UPDATE:
Verification department clerk at VirtEx looks at the last image upload ONLY. There are 3 more, does not bother look at the other 3 images, instead calls me and tells me my photo ID did not meet their standards.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:19:43
Congratulations everyone. 
the "21 million coins only" mythical has finally been diluted to 100 million.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:26:38
Is gold/silver/any other metal legal tender?
Is gold market crashing because miners need to pay taxes?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:58:51
How do you know what are the attitudes in China?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:46:03
My suggestion - do not trust anyone with BTC. Be very careful.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:22:12
That's not gonna help.
so you have your milli-bit trading daily at +/- 5%.
or you have a numerous shitcoins trading at at +80% a day.
which one do you think people will flock to?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:13:49
Did you even bother to look at those exchanges?
OKCoin and FXBTC trade LTC for fiat, and they account for 80% of global LTC trade.
See? These are the orders to buy and sell LTC for fiat yuans. Not BTC.
So yes, these are more-less fair market prices.

Another communication from Cavirtex, looks like their internal communication process is broken? So I just spoke with the CEO, who personally approved it, and now I recieved this:

If you please submit your 2012 notice of assessment, your SIN number any other personal data can be blacked out your name address and showing that it is from the government must be visible.

Open Source is horrible at marketing. There is simply no incentives.

This is why stock splits exist. This has to be done asap or BTC will begin losing its mindshare.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:02:56
Thank you Ben for boosting BTC prices.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:48:51
amount of LTC traded multiplied by LTC's market price.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:49:15
This should explain how Litecoin is pumped and dumped: 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:56:02
Go look at LTC volume on OKCoin, they trade 150 million dollars in volume daily, 3x bigger volume than the biggest BTC exchange in the world, why do you think? 
The psychological price barrier is real, and you can see the consequences already.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:55:31
The liquidity is improving daily. Look at btc china's orderbook, 6-7 million each way. Similar numbers at gox and bitstamp. You could probably convert 100 mil to fiat even today, and not move prices by more than a few percent, if you are careful about it.
Any huge order will depress prices, if you are stupid enough to show your hand and run it in one huge market order. 
Arbitrageurs will gladly buy your coins for a small fee.

Here's how litecoin gets higher and higher: 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:13:26
We all know its a binary bet. It's all or nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:16:27
Good job, continue to do so, and never demand any improvements.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:43:32
I am not a litecoin advocate. Do you seriously think LTC trading at this levels will not attract attention and dilute the mindshare, create confusion, etc?
