That is horrible advice. Lawyers cost a whole lot more than he will ever seen from mtgox.

As someone who has also been around for the other crashes you're right, there has been nothing but good news for bitcoin recently and no reason for it to go down. The only plausible explanation is the worlds banks. Probably jews.

You must be invested. Open your eyes. Realize your delusion. This guy just made that shit up as an excuse for his silence. The real reason is insolvency. 
Or wait maybe someone just HAPPENED to threaten his daughters life RIGHT before insolvency problems.

What happened to him exactly? Didnt bitcoiners give him like a bunch of bitcoins and some reporters bothered him and thats it? How does that prove anything? And look at that news reporter. Shes already been killed by all the idiots on the internet who were threatening her. Wait no she hasnt. Because people make threats on the internet constantly and if you have tun run into hiding and shut down your company and go silent for 2 weeks every time that happens maybe you shouldnt be the public face and CEO of a bitcoin company? The truth is this is a ruse to keep fools on the hook long enough to get away cleanly. People wont start calling lawyers and police until they have 100% proof they have been scammed so this is the perfect way to buy more time and keep everything up in the air.

Let me TL:DR.
~~all the money is gone and its been like 3 weeks and~~ **i have been silent because my family is in danger!** ~~since it ran out of money weeks ago, only weeks into its life~~ **i went to england on a business trip, and now since im in danger im staying in hiding!** ~~all the bitcoins and money are gone~~ **but i have been lining up additional capital, only until i was threatened and now I am going to run away** ~~from this business that has no money and is fucked~~
Next post on frontpage: this is good for bitcoin because...

Of course its not "because they are stupid fucking idiots and their business model relied on a huge bet bitcoin would go up" its because of a worldwide conspiracy by evil bankers. Makes perfect sense. The mind of bitcoiners will be studied by behavioral psychologists in the future I swear.

Checks out. I take it all back. Best wishes to Danny!

LOL its funny that you basically say, people will murder each other for money. Yet its less likely this guy is just you know... making all this up and stealing the money? Think about it. If youre claiming people will commit the worst crime possible for money, that just means this Danny guy is even more likely to have scammed everyone.... For money.

boom busted.

Yes, it sounds just like every other statement every other bitcoin company has issued before completely imploding. What about it makes it any different? Do you think this is a normal way for an investor in a company to act? Seriously?

If weve learned anything over the last few years. Its that the CEO's of bitcoin companies dont lie on bitcoin talk. I mean, they could never work in bitcoin again!
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:07:21
He's right 
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:04:07
Im not claiming to know facts. Im claiming to have a fucking spec of common sense and intuition. Bear in the mind this company claimed it has millions of fiat dollars literally weeks ago and said they did the IPO only to raise extra bitcoin. Hasnt updated "investors" in any way at all, and the CEO dissapeared for weeks before saying "oh i left cause i am scared and im also selling it all for the same reason and trying to find money cause we already ran out". Seriously dude?

Except that youre post seemed to be essentially saying "look people will burn people in tires so its extremely likely what hes saying is true and this isnt just a fake threat or a lie from him." to support the notion he really is in danger. When the much more likely scenario under the same assumption is that there is no threats at all and he is simply bamboozling everyone.
