From what I hear, there are quite a few people joining behind the scenes.  A lot of people you would recognize have recently joined a private LTC dev slack to work on Lightning and Confidential transactions.

Who exactly is being scammed?
Can you really argue that Litecoin still doesn't bring anything to the table?

If denied UASF, instead of accepting that Litecoin has these things already to offer (as per your words: 'just the same as Bitcoin with 3 irrelevant changes'... and now the features you've been fighting hard for in place), your solution instead is to create an altcoin all to try and compete with Ethereum?
I think other people than Litecoin followers are being fooled here.

I'm not quite sure what you're really trying to get at here.
There are already a handful of bitcoin core developers working on Litecoin and testing out some of the features you have mentioned. 
I do agree with you though that people should stop looking at Litecoin as LTC vs. BTC and start looking at it as a LTC + Bitcoin.
With cross atomic swaps, I really think Litecoin will finally fulfill it's role of being 'Lite' Bitcoin with more daily spending use with Bitcoin carrying its digital store of value role.

While there are definitely faster coins at the moment, it won't be long until Lightning is fully realized on Litecoin.  
Litecoin is poised to receive all the goodies Bitcoin users want in the nearby future.  
It will definitely be interesting to see how Litecoin operates as a spendable currency and how the same features can make its eventual way to Bitcoin.
