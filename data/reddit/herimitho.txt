I'm not completely sure the normal store and the bundles share the same payment system. On the store I only have credit card and paypal as options, on the bundles I have CC, Paypal, Amazon, Google Checkout and Bitcoin.

It *bings* a tear to your eye.

Well, as long as one use two factor auth. it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:06:10
That sounds logical. I assumed it had something to do with donations vs payments but I guess you are still buying a product for the bundle!
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:44:43
I don't think so. It would probably be against their policy if I used BTC/Doge to sell in-app purchases. I believe it's the same with PayPal donations as well.

Was excited for this, but I can't get verified. I don't actually have any utility bill so it's impossible for me to proceed.

Indeed. If you're that worried you can just transfer a buck in then try and transfer it out again as soon as it arrives to see if it works. It's gonna take a good hour+ to test it but hey, at least then you know. :P

Fuck, wrong image. :(

I find it much easier to type the amount in your local fiat currency. You are much more familiar with 5 USD vs 50 USD (if you're American) than you are from 0.005 BTC to 0.05 BTC.
Edit: But if you sent them to friends or families can't you just tell them you made a mistake and would like the difference back?

Wee, my dream of getting tipped has come true! :D
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:01:38
Look into the bitcointip bot. :)

I was confused on what the hell this was!

Will these only work on a japanse PS account?

Selling Humble Bundle games is kinda douchey and definitely against their TOS.

I just transfered 100 NOK worth of BTC to MtGox 45 minutes ago. It still hasn't been completely verified (thus hasn't shown up on Mt.Gox yet). But I can check for you as soon as it goes through.
Edit: Hmm.. under the withdraw funds tab it seems pretty straight forward to withdraw BTC, and it doesn't mention anything about any requirements except for bank transfers.

Chances are if he used it any time after - which I assume he did since who would format a PC and put in on a shelf - there's a very major chance that any of the sectors the file used has been overwritten.

Do you have any experience with people using a USD Steam card with an European Steam account? I've Googled it a bit but it's hard to find a definitive answer.
Edit: I googled some more and found [this]( if anyone was wondering the same:


@_date: 2013-11-19 15:47:52
But if you already have BTC, you can deposit some to your Mt. Gox account and then trade with that, first by selling of course. Right?
Edit: typo
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:48:38
But it has only crashed once. Isn't one data point kind of low to make assumptions on? But what do I know, I've been waiting for a crash for three weeks now so I can buy some more.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:29:51
Can't you even accept the tip and transfer it to another wallet that you own?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:58:53
That doesn't guarantee that anyone buys them though. If you want to have a very quick ~~buy~~ sale at 1k USD you probably have to use one of the trading websites.

Keep up the good work!

I bought 100 NOK worth of Bitcoins as well a few weeks ago. I too looked into using those pay-with-mobile sites to buy them with, but I discovered they take completely absurd cuts from what you actually pay. So I think it's completely feasable that you actually never got 16.3 USD worth of bitcoins, but something the lines for 2-3 USD which now are worth almost 5.
You can't say that you got scammed unless you actually know how much bitcoin you got for your 100 NOK the first time you bought them.
Edit: I checked one of them now.
    You spend kr 50,00 NOK    You recieve ฿0,00249610
Those 0.00249610 BTC are ACTUALLY worth 9.533 NOK.
