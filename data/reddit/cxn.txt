And the anti-Iranian rhetoric got really heated right around the time they opened their oil exchange and asked everyone to use anything but the dollar.
I used to think the petrodollar was a conspiracy theory but... I mean, there'd have to be a lot of coincidences of wars and policies that just so happen to protect it.

Regardless of being rude, you just did the site a great service. It's a damn good thing this taught them to not do that in the future instead of someone doing it malevolently

This is probably just him being the scapegoat for the past issues. I'm not sure how mt gox is set up but I'd wager this is either the result of being forced out or him agreeing to take a generous leave package so the company can distance itself from the recent criticism.
That said, things probably wont be any different

You would see that a lot more if it was a feasible way to be as profitable. It is sometimes, depending on the user-base, but usually not. The thuth is, most people would rather deal with a couple adds than have to pay anything. Personally I'm glad I get all this content for free because of a few fools clicking on ads they see.

No problem.


It may be kind of intuitive to think so but money doesn't really work like that. Think about it: billions of dollars is already 'given away for free' by governments and individuals  all the time, which when everage out would equal no small sum per person. for example, through tax cuts and welfare programs. considering the bloated, inefficient and self-perpetuating welfare systems in most western countries, it'd be an improvement from anyway you look at it- throughout left and right perspectives.

It's giving people a fair chance.  its hard for anyone but the poorest of people to understand but it's very hard to make something from nothing: the biggest risk factor for poverty as an adult is being born into poverty. basic income enables a person to have something to work with. Normal welfare often either doesn't do enough or even helps perpetuate the poverty trap, depending on country. And it's important to remember it's not just giving money away, to never be seen again- basic income would stimulate the economy and make it more healthy by keeping money flowing, since the money will be spent.

it'd obviously have to be from increased gov revenue, not just printed... versions of basic income have been implemented before, in other countries and even in 'pilot programs' in the US, without starting the apocalypse.
Like I said, it'd replace a lot of the outrageous amount we already spend on welfare, and would be more productive than welfare because it wouldn't cause the "welfare trap."

I use a combination of avira, comodo and adblock. I would always recommend a good firewall on custom settings- I once caught a virus that got past my anti-virus programs, only to be caught when it tried to connect to the internet and comodo asked me what I wanted to do with it. I also run a malwarebyte scan once in a while just in case.

wait, maybe I'm mis-remembering it but wasn't it said at the time- way back when it first came out that he supposedly hired a hit-man- that the hit-man he tried to hire was actually the guy that stole them? Fuck I'm confused. how that connection was made way back then before all this info came to light?

At this point I don't think a coherent film could be made out of it, no matter how long it is. there are so many twists and turns and absurdities that it's confusing even for people that have a firm understanding of bitcoin, forget about the general public. Not to mention we probably don't even know the half of it yet.

I think the judge didn't allow the defense to use the evidence though,  I'm pretty sure it wasn't withheld by the prosecution.

yes. It's not unlike how extremists of all colors around the world hate basically all mainstream media, not only the likes of msnbc or fox news but even the more respected organizations, because of a supposed liberal bias. 
I'm not by any means comparing them to terrorists, just pointing it out as one of the ways people with extreme ideas try to prevent the cognitive dissonance of their ideas vs reality presented by respected news orgs

I wonder if the manner in which they do this (speed and amount put in at once) will make them some extra money...  that'd be cool but not sure about the legality of municipalities making such investments
really though, hate to say it but it seems like  it could be a pretty bad idea (or great one) considering how volatile the market is and how smart he is with holding them
