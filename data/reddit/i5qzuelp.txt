The alternative is $10/mo for an organizational google account with a custom domain.  
$10 / mo + $1 / mo (domain) = 11/mo.  Inexpensive.
Not only that, but the organizational account may have unlimited storage (mine does, not exactly sure why).

Avalon's Yifu Guo [screwed over a lot of their customers]( by redirecting the ASIC chip sale in 2013 that was paid for to someone who offered more money, from my understanding.
After that Avalon lost customers/trust while Bitfury came out with their chips sales.  After that, somehow, Bitmain beat out Bitfury.
Anyway, Avalon fell to shit after they screwed over their customers with their "no bullshit" contract.  Biggest bullshit that existed.

buy a $12 domain at domains.google.com.  Wildcard forward all emails to domain to your gmail account.  
Now any email forwarded to the $12 domain at any address end up in your google account.

True.  My understanding, though, is that the paid google services don't have the privacy issues (e.g., harvesting emails) that the non-paid service has.
Also, one of the reason i switched from the non paid to the paid service is b/c i was buying the cloud storage.  After reading a little online I realized that some organization accounts don't have storage limits .... tried it and boom.  My account has unlimited storage.  I have enough data there that would be about 150/mo if it was through the free google drive account.  Definitely won't be changing from the paid account.

My personal experience with Avalon is expect 3 month delays and little, if any, communication.

Doesn't mean people are buying like they used to or that they're a good product from a solid company.

I'm sorry but you can equally decide not to follow the social contract that society presents and move out.  You don't need to sign up for the selective service, you don't need to be a citizen when you hit 18.  All that can be changed.  I find the argument that its a contract that was forced onto anyone as ridiculous.  If you feel it was forced onto you then you might need to talk to your ancestors why the got you to where you are.

I'm just addressing one issue.  Taxes are good and not bad.
Addressing whether they are misused or how they may be unfair, inefficient, or misused is outside of that topic and a wholly separate discussion.  Taxes are good for society and skipping them is not okay.  
The argument may be derisive/sarcastic but, from my view, it shows the worst that can happen which is important to recognize from my understanding.

Yea, what the fuck are they thinking.  We'd fucking rather have Russia dropping nukes on our heads and suck em off while at it.  Life would be so much fucking better then.  What are those dumb fucks thinking using money to protect our interests.  We can fucking protect ourselves from anything.  We've got mfing bitcoins.

You were talking from the "always" point of view.  You were not discussing from the "general" or "average" point of view.  You clearly used the word "always."  Are you going to argue that "always" magically means "general" or "average" point of view now?  I clearly showed an exception to your "always" to rule that point null.
Considering your answer there are few, if any, reasons you would find to support taxation.  You appear to view the government that protects you as the enemy and don't really grasp how government works.
I'm not admitting implicitly anything within my discussion where there is silence on my part.  I honestly feel that, in the USA, taxes are too low and doesn't permit for creation of social services and lifelines as those that are present in Europe and China.  This is coming from someone who is both, a US and European citizen and has a 10 year visa to China - not something anyone can obtain.  I've seen how social services work in all three countries and, in general, the poor and unfortunate are weeded out by nature in the USA.  Fortunately, in Europe and China there are lifelines for those who are unfortunate.

Don't forget FBAR if you're dual citizen.  I'm dual citizen of US / PL ... no foreign assets but still something I'm aware of just in case.
If you don't file FBAR expect to lose a lot.

You heard it here first.
Stupid comments can be a good thing sometimes.

Well clearly you should have moved out earlier instead milking the system.

Move out of that country and stop using it's public services.  Better yet, get dropped in Afghanistan with your bitcoin and see how far you get.

I believe at certain times 100% taxation can be reasonable.  During WW2 taxation was extremely high - close to 94% on incomes above 200k.  If there was as WW3, considering the tax brackets, a tax of 100% on earnings above 50k I would support in lieu of losing.

Correct.  Either way, though, it's rediculous when people fail to realize that a lot of social services depend on people paying taxes.
Water/sewer services in most jurisdictions are paid for through taxes.  Schools are paid that way similarly.  Another item that taxes pay for are state and community colleges.
Without taxes you'd have corporations attempting to provide for those services.  Good luck, we already know how time is managed at places like Amazon (and in general, corporate america).
Pay your taxes.  In general they better society.  The other thing, is get active on the local government level.  Don't ignore it.
