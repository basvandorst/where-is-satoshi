Since he doesn't actually transfer money from PP but buys some sort of cards you can load directly into yours if you're from the US, I'm assuming chargebacks are not his MO. So maybe it's some sort of money laundering scheme considering the steep premium and his amount of activity.

There's a big online Bitcoin community buying and selling for bolivares, look for Bitcoin Venezuela in FB or search for ads on LocalBTC

Some people are snapping up cheap real state, but the problem is you're buying properties in a country without rule of law. Someone could just break into your property, take over it, and the police wouldn't do anything to help you, for example.
It might be a good long-term bet, but it's also very risky since your investment wouldn't be protected in any way.

Maybe, but since you're living in another country, how do you make those contacts? How do you send money to pay people off? Even if you're a local, having that kind of money doesn't guarantee protection, it often just makes you a bigger target for kidnappings or extortion.
Honestly, I have no idea how the people that snap up property here manage it. I'm sure there are workarounds around these problems, but I just wanted to point out it's not as easy as buying an apartment and then sitting on it until the local economy turns around.

Congrats! I don't know what your current setup is, but if you're holding several hundreds in BTC at once you should secure your wallets as much as possible.
If you're using online wallets, activate 2FA or try Xapo which offers cold storage with delayed retrievals if you don't think you'll need quick access to the entirety of your savings.
Otherwise, consider buying a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, which will give you an added layer of security.

Let me rephrase, I trust the technology and I'm not saying anyone should be hesitant to try Bitcoins, I'm just scared I might send coins to the wrong address by mistake; which has never happened to me, but it's still a bit exhilarating whenever I send money because it's so different from the experience of the banking system that rules my day to day life.

After years of using bitcoins, I'm still scared whenever I send money to a new address, that's normal. You're going to get a lot of complicated suggestions for securing your coins if you ask specifically about that, such as paper wallets, offline cold storage, etc. 
I do recommend you test out other wallets with better security for long term storage though, for peace of mind and less complications I'd recommend using a hardware wallet (check out comparisons and reviews on Youtube).
And if you want to put your coins to work to insure against price fluctuations, I've been testing BitLendingClub with decent results.

All the "blocked" websites are accesible again (I'm writing from Venezuela). There were a lot of affected sites that held no relation to Bitcoin at all.
CANTV (the ISP in question) is notoriously shitty, this was blown out of proportion.

Hah! Fun fact: $3 sold at the black market rate translate to about 1/3rd of the Venezuelan minimum wage and would buy me approximately 24 cups of coffee (nothing fancy, just a simple large coffee on the street).

Thanks!
