So people who think like you think they will be owners of the new world currency and hold power? This is why some people are not fit for some things. Just sell your btc and move on for it to have a chance

well listing something for x $ and actually getting someone to pay the asking price in full is so far apart from one another
edit: The buyer will need  27000 cocktails sold to have the initial investment paid.without paying taxes stack bills etc. cant understand how someone does that.

Even if it.
They state that if you give them 100$ fake they wont give it back in order for you to give them 100$ real.
they will keep the 100$ to give it to the police and in addition you will pay with 100$ real
