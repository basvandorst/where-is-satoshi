I wanted to use gdax, but its asking for odd information.
Its asking for pictures of my drivers license, my occupation, my employer, my job title, my employers phone number. Seems like strange info to need?

I wouldnt beg for money by implying people are not nice if they dont donate.
Rephrase your cardboard sign.

I keep seeing "fiat" mentioned, what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:40:23
Ok thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:23:34
Well i tried various amounts , like $1, $10, $15 all worked fine 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:35
Well i can just do the purchases manually, but the fee is what scares me..

Im trying to move my bitcoin from my coinbase to my gdax account.
I have a little over $20 worth, but when i try to transfer the full amount it says i do not have enough funds?

Whats a paper wallet and how does it work?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:30:17
Thank you! Is that just another app?

Ok thanks. Im setting up an accoint there, and it wants to know my source? I was just goinf to buy from my credit or bank account, but thats not an option. Also why does it need my employer?

I just set up my coinbase account, its going to charge a 4% fee every time i make a purchase. Thats going to add up a lot of expense reslly fast.
Is there a better way to go about this? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:57:26
Can explain to me the difference between this and actual bitcoins? Im very new to bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:09
Thank you for all your responses!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:27
Could you elaborate a little bit please? 
I set up a coinbase and gdax accoubt last night. The coinbase charged me lik 8% to buy $20. Thats crazy. 
The gdax wants me to put in my social, employer, and job title. That seems like odd information to need..
Is there a better way to do this to set up weekly purchases?

Also it wants to access my phones camera, and says i need to upload photos of my ID? 
That seems sketchy as shit
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:16
Is that any riskier than any other mutual fund ?
