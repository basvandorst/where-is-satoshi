On approximately May 14th, 2020, Bitcoin will undergo it's 3rd halving. With speculation around this unique event inevitably taking center stage in the new year, Jack and Ryan from our research team put together this simple article outlining [**everything you need to know about the upcoming halving**](   
A quick refresher on what exactly the halving is, why it matters and what the potential scenarios that may play out are (number go up, number go down, number stay the same).   
With a bit of history behind us, they also take a look at how the BTC price behaved leading up to and following each previous halving. In each instance, the day of the halving turned out to be non-events, with massive price-runs of 9,100% and 2,800% occurring in the following year. (However they found that there were a confluence of other factors on the demand side of Bitcoin beyond the halving that more than likely drove those increases).

valid point but if you can earn BTC while buying something else you needed to begin with, then that's all the better :)
