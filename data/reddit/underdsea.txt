It's more than you tipped him.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:51:01
Well, BTC is not universally recognized that I can see so to get him convicted of fraud by a government would be a huge win for BTC in the legitimacy of the currency, or if not a currency a commodity.
Perhaps it wasn't making as much as people say, if it was it should have been simple to hire a solid programmer to fix the bug, heck a team of solid programmers.

Have you seen some of the recent gox threads with the number of BTC lost.

Yes, is a replacement for the earlier sub.

This would be why I suspect he's not done it yet - he hasn't worked out how.
He has plenty of money if that's his intention. If he's not planning on leaving then why not announce the "good news, we're fixing everything, it just might take time" that everyone wants to hear
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:06:11
Oh ok, so you are taking advantage of the current situation and didn't have them before and they got stuck
Good luck with getting them out! Unfortunately though I suspect you're up shit creek my friend.

It sounds like you've never built a payments processor within a large corporate before.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:40:06


Exactly my point, if you're holding 300 BTC you sure as shit want to sell off 1 or 2 and kit yourself out with some cold storage solution for the rest of them.
Thanks for correcting me by the way, I was thinking buy for $5k sell for $15k tidy profit, but buy for $50k and sell for $150k, I can understand why he's nervous, however, I still feel it's a **HUGE** risk that may not pay off for quite some time, if not at all.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:34:54
Unless you're planning on selling your money it should be in cold storage.
If you were gambling by selling on that 5% increase then buying back in when it slumped that's your prerogative. However you should only be gambling what you're willing to lose.
If you had $100,000 of BTC and you were gambling on making that $5,000 you're not doing something I would consider financially responsible. IMO you should have kept 80% of it offline and gambled with the other 20%.
Loosing 20% sucks but not as much as 100%.
No I don't know when it's peaking or slumping but I sure as shit don't trust someone that's completely unregulated with all of my savings.

Could you set up one of those challenge-response based systems that requires you to respond once a month, if you don't respond within a week with the code word (could be as simple as an email to you "are you still alive?", respond "yes") it emails the password to your wallet to your partner or parents?

What is money but a vehicle for payment?
Seriously, can you please define it?
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:23:27
I'm just not sure how this is not an 'alt-coin' can someone explain that (sorry I'm at work no chance to listen to the podcast until tomorrow).
It appears to me that by sacrificing/reserving 10 BTC I can make my own 'side-chain', of which I define everything. It essentially seems to be like a 100% pre-mined alt-coin backed by some BTC, which to me, seems like a different name for a very similar beast.
It also appears to me that one these coins have been reserved they cannot be converted back to BTC (i.e. in my above example if you gain control of 1/10 of my 'side-chain' coins, there's no way to recombine into one of the original BTCs), so in that way, they really are an 'alt-coin'.
Please correct my errors, this has confused me. It just seems like just a new way to create alt-coins from existing BTCs.

Well the thing here is that you'd deposited them in a US based 'company' so your property was sitting on US soil at the time of the seizure.
If you carry drugs into the United States on a plane it is OK for the government to seize your property when you attempt to enter the country.
I suspect if you'd claimed your funds they would have returned them to you (while alerting your government you were interacting with a potentially illegal website).
Silk Road was a website set up for anonymity, the US government did the best they could do by putting up a website saying 'hey, claim your coins' how else were they suppose to find you? 
They can't hold onto seized goods forever.

... and just when I thought I'd have a civilized discussion on you go and ruin it.
fine, I'll bite


hence my question, this is a completely legitimate use of having 300 BTC in an online wallet although a huge risk, it's his money and he can do what he likes with it. If he'd answered my question (which he has, civilly - well before you decided to jump down my throat) this would have been the answer I was looking for.




Actually I said nothing of the sort, thank you for jumping to conclusions and not reading my posts.
What I actually was saying was this, why do people store large amount of money in an online wallet when it is simple enough to buy a couple of external hard drives and store an encrypted wallet in them, then place each hard drive in a discrete location for safety.
In today's world the reason people keep money in banks is for easy access to money (ATM access), safety (through regulation) or to make more money (interest). Storing BTC on an online wallet provides none of these hence my question, why not just store them in cold storage.
You were correct by the way, OP has involved themselves in arbitrage between the current mtgox price and the rest of the market. However I cannot think of any other good reasons to keep large quantities of BTC online. Hence my question.

Stole is an interesting word.
They seized all the assets and then had a website where customers could request their deposited funds. In this case I would say the SK customer who did not apply for their coins back forwent their coins.
DPRs coins were seized as well. In the same way cash is seized when they bust up a meth dealers house and find wads of cash. They don't just burn that cash, they redistribute it just like they are doing with the coins here.

I haven't seen these rumours, do you have any links?
There's something that stinks about the whole thing but it's still almost impossible to tell whether or not it's incompetence &amp; negligence or straight out fraud.
One thing would annoy me though is if he gets hard time but all these other 'world corporations' continue to get away with laundering cartel money etc without a day being charged to their CEO.

and I'm pointing out that the internet has a similar problem with the good names taken, but people appear to have moved past that issue.
Also the internet has a large barrier to entry for a new site to be popular. I think it's an apt comparison.

This is interesting though, he might not turn up at all. It does not say that it was refused, merely that it would be looked down on.

Really, what kind of innovation have you been expecting exactly? Paypal, square, credit cards, contact-less payments, paper notes, polymer notes, the list goes on for a while, even cheques are a money innovation in the time frame specified.
You comment that money hasn't innovated in hundreds of years and then state that payments networks were designed in 1958. Regulation might slow innovation a bit but it has hardly stopped innovation.

Playing devils advocate here not saying I agree, the fallout would be:
- Thousands of skilled jobs lost in America and probably more around the world
- Millions (?) of customers who have accounts with the company panic and uncertain what will happen to their money
- Huge loss of trade with other countries (not terrorist states but hsbc has large offices in Hong Kong and London)
- Investments probably all go sour (that office block they've put up capital for, the apartments etc)
- Following on from the investments tens of thousands of additional jobs lost again in America (not at hsbc itself) when construction stops (unsure about other material investments)
And that's just off the top of my head.

Just a question, and I want to preface it with, I don't intend to be rude and I understand this is probably a very tense time for you as you have a considerable value tied up in a website but no knowledge of when it might come back out.
Why did you not store the 300+ BTC locally? It seems that a number of people were (are?) storing large sums of money on various websites/exchanges with no benefit to themselves (they're not paying interest or anything of the sort as I understand).
I understand that the blockchain is massive now days, but with $15,000+ USD I would have thought it worth it to download and store locally.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:49:39
You're really hurting my head now too.
A computer or smart phone is not bought as an investment vessel, they're being bought for use in the moment and near future.
If Bitcoin continues to rise from $1k to $100,000 by the year 2040 why would I EVER sell when I can keep spending my cold hard cash.
If noone sells then it drives the price EVEN HIGHER.
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:20:28
Oh he should definitely do time whether it was incompetence or fraud. With that much money involved across so many people incompetence should be no excuse.
It just annoys me that he can be held accountable because it was a small company but in a large one it's "not the exec's fault". Even if the magnitudes of money are the same.
