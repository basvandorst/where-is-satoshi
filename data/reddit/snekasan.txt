I've been lurking since spring. Talked to wife and bought in  and  for total 0.1 BTC. I know I know, easy there Ahab that's whale talk.
Discussed cashing out  or just HODL.
We both learned about the tech, I even attended blockchain lectures.
I really really really believe in the technology. In the principles of decentralized, transparent network of trust. But fuck trading/hodling cryptocurrencies isn't for my nerves.
I mean BTC itself might possibly even be the final form, but the icebreaker that makes all future development possible. Maybe like steam power in the industrial revolution.
There are technical issues that will be ironed out with fees and transaction volumes. I'm certain of this.
I just had a really hard time trusting an asset that scummy assholes can manipulate so easily. BTC might not be for me today, but if or when it is a safe store of value I will be back. Or even printing money with value tied to forks. 
(hey I have X bitcoin, lemme just "invent" Bitcoin Cash and artificially inflate it's value to print some cash for myself. At least this is how Interpret it) 
Unfortunately cashed out  today and I'm living to regret it ��
On the other hand my BTC gave me a 35% gain in about 8 weeks and outperformed in pure value my entire portfolio in stocks and bonds for the full year. So thanks BTC and until we meet again.
Stay HODLING and keep your heads cool my fellow adventurers.

I have to echo this a little.
Honestly the volatility scares me off. I'm not in a situation where I can gamble for the sake of hodling.
I mean, I still think blockchain is an awesome think with massive potential but the crypto market to me seems scummy as fuck with basically anyone having a license to print money.
I wish it was at a stage where it is a safe store of value but today Crypto currencies are anything but. Strange landscape.

But, for us small time holders who haven't invested in hardware wallets or maybe still lack a complete understanding of the reasons for a fork etc.
Does it make sense to keep my current value/coin at an exchange (in my case coinbase) post fork and sell off the B2X. Wouldn't this be the definition of fee money? 
I've been lurking for a while and it seems like consensus here is that B2X is a shitcoin. In that case is it better to move my key to a wallet like electrum/mycelium etc?
Still so many questions and I can't seem to get a grasp on what the consensus safe advice is.

Is this not exactly how the FIAT banking system works though?!
