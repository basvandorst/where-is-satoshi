If they want that people use it, they should better implement in their reference GUI wallet. And yes SEGWIT(2x) is rediculous, but for other reasons: the 2x part of Segwit is something everbody could have used directly, the Segwit part not such much (8% adoption, laughable).

God forbid people are actually using the bitcoin network. How about we stop making transactions, then we dont have a scaling problem any more. Checkmate big blockers.

No, you have a carefully laid out plan and present it to multiple managers. One thinks you should do A) to scale another thinks you should B), after many months of discussions (loosing critical time) a plan C is formulated as a compromise. Instead of following it you stop it vehemently last minute, because mur reasons and everything is still fine, if not just a tiny bit more expensive as usual.  Months later that manager comes back and screams at you why you didn't warn him. And all you can do is (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻.

I don't see how anything else than people selling produced this drop and the current fear. At some point, the bubble had to burst. This was going up 2000% this year, did you really think this could go on forever?

I don't like the gold analogy. Gold can't be forked to create new gold. Gold can't be soft forked. Gold can't be hard forked to change the rules. Ultimately, artificial scarcity is really no guarantee for a store of value, it just encourages it if enough people think its more valuable in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:53:18
fees? i think at this point he'd rather kill his own creation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:39:33
Miners could also try to collude and to try to decrease the block size, I would leave out a decrease of the maximum value in this update protocol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:44:08
Yeah because you can fork gold and have new gold. Or create better new gold out of thin air altogether. The gold analogy isn't very fitting.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:10:35
As far as I see it, doing a transaction into and out of a lighting channel will be the same costly transaction as it is now. Locking funds in a channel means someone else needs to charge fees, so LN will not be free, either.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:46:48
... and risk waiting until it gets dropped from the mempool completely. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:08
On a more serious note, this isn't all black or white. Either 1MB blocks or 1GB blocks. There is some in between and it would probably also be needed to make the on and off ramps for lighting efficient. Also, it shouldn't be rushed out either, so buying a bit of time would do bitcoin good.

Some are backpeddling on Bitcoin support because of the impractical fees (e.g. Steam), bitpay is implementing paying with other cryptos coming January.

Was the pizza delicious though?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:46:09


Sure. What I don't understand, is this insistance on finding a scaling solution that can do Visa level tx/sec and only accepting it if it could do that or rejecting and objecting it entirely.  Bitcoin or any other crypto doesn't need to replace Visa and it doesn't need to have Visa-like transaction capacity. There is some middle ground. But 4 per second doesn't cut it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:00:52
Yeah but we need smaller blocks because of "centralisation issues". Because otherwise you can't run a node on some old closet PC.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:37:49
And it's a problem right now, not in a couple of months. Vendors are opting out of Bitcoin now (e.g. Steam), because it doesn't make any sense anymore for them to have that payment option.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:03:58
But hey, the guy saved 5x 20 dollars in fees!
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:36:21

Yes. If you've invested 17 years ago into oracle, at its peak, you're up a cool 2% or so now.  Actually with inflation you're down a lot.

And thats unfortunatly the state of affairs now. Bitcoins fees will be a running joke for a while, but dont worry everything will be solved once lighting comes and is used in 18 months.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:35:54
This is definitely a bit different though. He borrowed money, so he is royally fucked. Either way, if the price doesn't rebound quick enough.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:29
More like 4 transactions per second though
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:12
It's always been volatile and people spend it nonetheless. Right now it doesn't make a lot of sense for small purchases solely because of the fees, but it used too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:05
You are not a socket puppet, if you disagree with someone. Also he mentioned 3 alternatives to bitcoin, not just one. All three of them are a better cryptocurrency at the moment than bitcoin. Because you can actually send money.

And the moon is made out of cheese. Most mature code base, most tested coin, sure. But many technological advancements are now found elsewhere in other coins, e.g. with smart contracts.

Real fear will realistically form sub 10k. There wont be much movement over Christmas I suspect and some tax related selling before the year ends. But this bubble might be over now and you probably wont see all time highs until the next one.

Difficulty aside, it doesnt make economic sense to do bitcoin transactions anymore, even if you wait 1-2 days.

@_date: 2017-12-13 13:52:45
Which is not here yet, is not tested well enough and will need significant time for adoption. I dont even think 18 months is realistic. Also needs on-chain transactions to get into and out of the second layer. I dont think LN will be useless, but its not going to be the unicorn solution for scaling either that everybody makes it out to be.

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:05:51
Reality is though that Ethereum and Bitcoin cash are handling more transactions now than Bitcoin does, and who knows maybe even Litecoin soon. They have become kind of like sidechains. If no scaling solution is found for bitcoin (e.g. lighting further delayed), they will get more adoption with vendors. I don't know, maybe that kind of decentralisation (multiple chains / multiple currencies that can be used to buy things) is a good idea to scale crypto in general?

Sure. There is a 100 year precedent that buying (solid) stocks is a good idea and that it has, so far, never been a bad idea. They also pay dividends which provide you with continues income. At the same time I don't think many new buyers of bitcoin are very patient and have a time horizon of more than a few weeks in mind. There is a lot of precedent that timing with bitcoin is important and that each bubble is followed by a 80-90% decline. Doesn't matter if you'll be able to be green in a few years, seeing -80% for 3 years doesn't feel very good.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:54:01
Let introduce a different example: Elon Musks new rockets are the most technologically advanced, but that doesn't mean they wont blow up more often. I never assumed technologically advanced equals anything else and I didn't put any kind judgement on it. Explicitly, although I did mention a complex example (smart contracts) it doesn't even imply complexity. All that is advanced in Bitcoin are the fees at the moment, but its simply isn't the most technology advanced crypto anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:39:48
yes and pay 20$ extra every time you do just for the pleasure of getting your transaction through in a timely manner
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:53:04
People will always be drawn to FOMO and the end result is often buy high sell low and not the other way around. 25k is somewhat what people predict for the top, I tend to think we 've already seen it at 20k. Either way, it's a bit late to buy in low. A sub 10k crash could get ugly for you if you've invested now. Ask yourself, would you panic sell if we see sub-10k?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:48:19
I did and it is still not true. All arguments you make are for bitcoins maturity and that having the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency bears significant risk (and I totally agree!), but that doesn't make it the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. The opposite actually, it is the most conservative one.

I don't get celebrating 1 dollar fees either. Nice that its not 20 anymore. But a while ago you could send it with 1 cent fees.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:47:21
Inconvenient truth is that average fees are still high ( and that hasn't pushed people to use segwit yet. What about other on chain scaling solutions, anything in the pipeline? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:42:01
You keep repeating that, but nobody knows whats going to happen. Im more worried about average fees &gt; 13usd right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:59:32
Serious question: why cant we have both? On chain and off chain scaling. Kind of what the segwit2x proposal was. Or do we need developers motivated by the fee pressure of 5+usd per transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:38:48
Nobody knows whats going to happen, its crypto after all. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:30:55


As if the whole china thing last time was a catastrophic event. New buyers selling, more new buyers panic selling, holders panic selling -&gt; don't underestimate mass hysteria. You don't even need a catastrophic event. But if I would bet, I would say the catalyst will be some exchange going belly up, people losing money and suddenly we're in a bear market again.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:00:43
I and many others would have rather had bitcoin expand its 1MB limit and go on with it. As that didn't happen, thats why there are forks like cash now. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:12:44
It happened to me when there was this extremely fast rise in fees. Got outbid on a 5+ dollar fee and I don't consider that low balling. Sure it resolved itself eventually when fees came down, but its still annoying.  It's better now of course with falling fees, but you never when the next transaction bidding war happens. :/
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:19:30
It's also sooooo yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:58:35
My suspicion is we will be a few days above 10k as we move into mania/delusion territory, after that a crash well below 10k. If you don't think that's a possibility, then it's your first bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:57:21
Yes and if I pay to little my transaction gets stuck and then what?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:51
11.5k to under 9k is more like 25%
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:59:04
Which is kinda sad, isn't it? I really hope that we'll have sub $0.10 fees again one day.

Can't really understand all the hate against the 2x block increase. Bitcoin will need to extend the block size at some point in the future, to accommodate anticipated growth. Even with LN. And LN ist still just a possible solution - there is nothing that works at the moment. We could also stop the confusion, by all agreeing to the fork and then it wont be messy either. But maybe some of the anti-forkers can chime in 
 and explain why they feel so strongly against it.
