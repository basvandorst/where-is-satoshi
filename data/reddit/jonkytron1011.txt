Some advice.. never sell at a loss.. never sell because you think it will dip and buy for cheaper. No one can Time the tops and bottoms and they’re a liar if they say they can. if you want to buy more, buy when you feel like everything is crashing and you’re freaking out. If you ever want to exit a portion of your investment, exit when you’ve just seen a huge run up in the market (like today for instance) good luck!

No one asked you to buy it. Sit back and watch

Not worried. I just want to see the doubters lose BIG. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve been laughed at by banker friends and people who didn’t do their homework.

Let them pump it and let them dump it and when it’s cheap I’ll buy some more. Am I the only one in this for the future of money out of the hands of banksters and governments?

Sell it on local bitcoins... take the cash to a casino, change it in for chips, then cash out after a bit of gambling, report the gambling winnings and pay taxes on that.

Most of us who have made money in bitcoin is because we bought cheap coins from shakey hands during moments of FUD. If you’ve done your research and believe in the tech and the future of bitcoin, just hold and chill. If you’re not a believer of bitcoin, and just want to make a profit, Pick a point when you want out, (40% gain or $50,000 a coin) and sell when it reaches that point. Don’t be greedy and do think anything is guaranteed.

Once we figure a way to make clean energy cheaper than dirty energy, we won’t have a problem. Maybe bitcoin will help us find a way when people start investing money and interest for clean mining.

Just buy and Hodl dude! 90% of people who try to predict top and bottoms and day trade lose money.  also, even if bitcoin does 10x return in next two years (goes to 120,000 per coin), you will have $500 from your investment of $50. Thats not bad, but dont expect to get rich from a $50 investment. If you believe in the tech and like the idea of a future with decentralized currency, invest your $50, and a little more whenever you can each week or month, and just HOLD

my instagram account is 
If you want to share the wealth, I only sell my photographs for bitcoin, because I believe its the future and want as many people using it for purchasing, and not just investing. Got over 50 people in NYC on coinbase who did so just to buy my photos. Not very expensive if youre interested :)
