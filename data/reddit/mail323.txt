People are jealous they couldn't develop the most popular mining pool.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:48:07


Does this generate more profits?
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:46:30
Make it easy to use. I can download the miner software, put 1) pool server address (host/ip) 2) username and maybe 3) Password and it's mining.
P2pool requires more steps and I'm not sure how it works. Do I have to solve a block to earn a reward? Does it pay more than a pool?

What exactly doesn't conform? They didn't put a CE, WEEE, and ROHS logos on the product?

Due to their shady business practices, buying from NewEgg requires the protections afforded by your credit card. This is one thing I would never use.

How would they transact with users of the forked blockchain?
@_date: 2014-01-10 07:02:21
I did, then I never heard back.

So in an attempt to prevent the possibility a bad thing happening you propose to solve it by deliberately doing the same bad thing?

As a rule I don't trust anyone, but you gave me the idea to check localbitcoins.com and that actually may not work. I was thinking "bank transfer" when that site lets me "sell bitcoins" ... same difference.

A: FUD.

What I do is buy the same item from Amazon.com. If they have it in stock it's more than likely the same price, no need to use a 3rd party data mining service to get free shipping and if there's an issue I can be assured there will be no hassles with the return and I can get a free return shipping label without having to call and request it.

@_date: 2014-06-09 01:02:58
Arguably your plan is a distributed, perhaps "white hat," 51% attack. We could debate philosophies all day but but either your proposal or the theoretical 51% attack would reduce the value and trust that Bitcoin presently holds.

Did you ever make a backup in iTunes? If the backup is encrypted OR you restore the backup to the same phone it should restore your Google Authenticator.
I recommend you encrypt the backup in iTunes so that you can restore the Google Authenticator to a different phone (e.g. your phone is lost/stolen)
Even better get a YubiKey NEO and the NFC-capable iPhone.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:09:10
What does it matter... the QR is scanned and has to be stored in the phone if you want to use 2FA.
Get a YubiKey NEO and you can store the 2FA outside the phone.

"Our Mt. Gox account is out of funds. We'll be happy to take your money and execute your order sometime in the future. Our transfer of funds to Mt. Gox is currently expected to clear on Friday Apr 5, 2013 at 04:56PM"
This is actually better than "Bit Instant:" who will take your money and send you a message such as:
Order status:  Executed
API Response:  Order failed. Balance too low.

Yes mtgox delays all their transactions. As far as I can tell bitstamps puts them right through and you suffer only the normal bank delays.

Well can you just tell us the truth what is going on with Dwolla?
I already submit a request in your site and all I get are generic and  blank reply.
Then in the other forum you guys tell me to submit again on your site. Makes no sense.
I am going to contact dwolla to see if they know what is going on with my funds. I will send you a PM with the order details.
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:23:59
Maybe they should sort out the major issues with their current BitInstant service before trying to expand to new ventures.

What ever happened with your "live chat?" In your site and also when you call in it says to use the live chat, but I can not find the chat and other posts suggest that it is gone as well.

How is it a signaling device? They are micro transactions. It's 200% in the spirit of bitcoin, why would you need to create an account and keep a balance to place an anonymous bet? You bet your money and get back your winnings.

Dwolla &gt; Bitstamp if anyone else wants to give it a try.

Can you explain what is the delay? Could you issue refund to Dwolla today quicker than processing the order... Or is your Dwolla account suspended?
Should i contact Dwolla for a refund?

And that's the problem WTF can't Apple permit Mt Gox or Blockchain to publish an official app?
We are NOT talking about replacing Apple in-app payments or anything like that. We're talking about basic functions that already exist in USD on the iPhone:
Mt Gox =  Same thing as etrade app that already lets you buy and sell stocks on your iPhone.
Blockchain = same thing as PayPal app that lets you send and recieve payments on your iPhone
@_date: 2013-03-09 19:59:49
Bitcoin is computer software. How could you possibly tax running computer software?
With that said if you are audited the IRS would not like if you cashed out more than you put in, so don't do that and spend the rest of the bitcoins. Use them to pay people, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:11:49
Where do you get these numbers from? I think everyone would be much less uneasy about this company if they posted an official statement on their site explaining the situation!
Instead they have horrible systems and horrible customer support.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:13:43
You are supposed to know that you need to keep the info. They don't tell you that. They don't even send you a confirmation email of any sort. After you submit on the first page save the 2nd page with the quote ID in tiny grey letters..... once you click next to go to their payment parter it never gives you the order info again. They don't tell you this, you are supposed to know.
@_date: 2013-02-22 09:40:35
Really? I told someone to pay me by ACH direct deposit, from a business account to another business account. I give them the account information. They are talking with their bank, yada yada. Two weeks later their bank mails me a check.
Didn't care about the delay, but I could have just been sent a check from the business instead of involving the hassle of the bank.
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:17:52
IMO buy $100,000 in bitcoins, sell $100,000 in bitcoins = 0 tax liability (0 cashed out profit).
Then spend the profit in bitcoins so that money never hits your bank account.

@_date: 2013-04-09 18:41:26
Why should a fraction of a kb of data on your server expire?
The real issues is probably because you guys don't have a proper tracking system. Every time your software fails for a reason such as you didn't have money in the account (which appears to be rather frequently) the order status never updates on your site! How can you guys keep track of things like that? I've seen many posts where it goes something like:
Order status: Executed
API Result: Your account balance -23.50 is not enough
One time I even saw that your forum processed the transaction manually and then your email support processed it again! 
You guys said months ago it was going to be fixed and I know I saw posts about this same issue in the past 3 days.

Which pools process transactions? I would like to mine on whichever pool includes the most transactions in their blocks... I have seen patches that block Satoshidice, 0 fee transactions, etc and I would like to avoid mining in that sort of pool.

I just sent them through PM, but they were also sent in your website on last Thursday!
