I think the confidence in the short term value of btc has been shattered, and that mtgox going off for 12 hours is just asking for another massive panic sale, but you shouldn't listen to me, just listen to your gut and be opportunistic
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:21:25
BTC-e is closer to the truth right now as mtgox has been frozen for around 5 hours and will come back in 7 hours (ish)

Lots of money to be made if you play it right, mistakes make you stronger if you learn from them!

THE LINE IS HOLDING

it's not a bubble guys, it'll be $300 this weekend guys
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:58:00
Yes, it was not a bubble, it was china, damn those commies!
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:45:37
nailed it
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:29:16
I thought he was asking if it was a buy order or sell order
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:43:32
To clarify what he said, Bitcoin value went up to $30, when the bubble burst, it went down to $2, in 2011
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:58:09
Yea, it wasn't a bubble at all, it was just mtgox and ddos attacks and hackers and bots and stuff, damn them!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:20:55
I think he meant he started buying when it crashed to 105-110 then he sold when it got to 180-190 before it started dipping again
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:38:24
Jesus christ you guys are retards
Edit: The guys mad over mtgox
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:59:12
SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:01:30
this is normal bubble behavior
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:05:44
All the speculators that has dived in has temporarily ruined bitcoin as a usable currency, atleast for me, but this is still fun!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:21:51
This place is usually a big circle jerk
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:36:51
are you talking about 2011?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:02:16
Love how you're getting downvoted, also ONE guy has a sell order right now for 1.36k at 118
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:15
Back to school with you
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:49:08
$30 originally, then I sold at 170, then bought back in at 120-130, then held till 220-230, was sad when I saw it go to 260, but now I'm glad I sold at 220-230
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:11:39
Are you joking?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:55:44
He's got a point though, what's been happening was inevitable, people blaming mtgox on what happened is pretty funny
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:37:15
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:27:26
The sad thing is that there's such a huge circle jerk when it comes to the question if there's a bubble, and this attitude just makes the bubble larger as it gives bitcoins a lot more confidence, but there's some people that is actually going to lose some money out of this
If you're not interested in selling now, then I would suggest selling when the dip has been recovered, before the bubble bursts, which it may be in the process of doing so right now, but I doubt it
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:25:34
whoa he mad
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:33:00
wouldn't say it's below market price since selling $500k worth is going to cause a dip
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:26:19
So I am just retarded.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:56:36
dips is only relevant if you're interested in day trading, unless it's a full on crash for when the bubble bursts, you shouldn't be bothered by it unless you want to make short term profit
The bitcoin is extremely profitable for day trading right now, the dips are steep, and they happen quite often, it was only two accounts that strong armed this back to $125 from $110
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:14:03
Wait until the bubble actually pops, it's just going through dips right now
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:42:36
Cash out half of it before the next dip?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:00:55
I guess it does sound bad when you put it like that, when applied to a newcomer, I'd like to rephrase, although you cannot directly compare gambling to investing the odds differs for each person, if you know what you're doing, it's just calculated risks rather than straight on gambling.
Do your research, talk to people, stalk the charts, be a critical thinker, you can rely on your instincts most of the time in opportunistic moments when you take all of the information available to you and use it with past experience, selling should be an opportunistic time rather than a panic time
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:06:27
Trading in eve online also perfectly illustrates this point
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:14:35
You read the entire article in 4 minutes? Am I just retarded?
And, it was a very good read, considerably more in depth than most articles
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:58:24
Good job, keep it up, if you stalk it like a maniac and have a good eye, you can sell some on the next dip
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:59:11
pump and dump
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:48:20
I believe in bitcoin, but I also believe in bubbles, I sold most of mine at 220-230
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:58:28
And those that were most greedy lost a lot of money as a result, a bubble popping is always inevitable, the hard thing to guess is what price it will pop at
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:16:54
In a town in Wales, there are 10 high class escorts for every 300 rich guys, if 9 escorts get their heads chopped off, would the market cap of the high class escort business be 10% after this?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:48:24
How is this different to the 2011 bubble?
