Ah okay. I invested in Sq as soon as the news came out and its up like 7 bucks a share since then. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:38:22
Ugh, you're right.

It was posted 4 times, and 3 of them were late at night.

what services on Facebook is he talking about? I have been a Facebook user daily since 2008, and have never had to pay for anything.

They see using it as currency as the same as selling it and then using the cash.

But it's already factored into the price of both BTC and SQ.

I'm going to sleep until I get access so I can bank up the sleep hours.

Me too, brother. Thursday is just around the corner.

I know, but the news is already factored into the price of both BTC and SQ.

My AMD is in my IRA so all my gains are mine. Uncle Sam gets a quarter of my BTC gains. : (

Banking on bitcoin on netflix will give you a good introduction. Write down words from the movie that you don't understand and google them after.

Get an account on Gemini. Start making deposits now, even if you aren't ready to invest because they have a 500/ day limit on deposits. Then google "bitcoin news" every few hours and read everything you see for a week. You'll pick up more than you think.

This is not mainstream.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:10:56
It's also really old news lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:32:11
Nah, I need my daily rush. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:08
Couldn't tell at first lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:09:46
I disagree.

I am really close to pulling out my initial investment. I will be pulling it out after the new year because I am worried about taxes if I sell now and I want time to figure it out. Fortunately for me, I am up 760% so most of my coin will stay when I sell the initial, and I can play with the houses money.

The second they start to sell, all Gemeni users will sell also. You don't need trust, you just need to pay attention.

True but it won't hurt me if I lose money that I could never have spent.

Are you saying they have their balls in their mouths? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:55:39
They literally put their money where their mouths are.
