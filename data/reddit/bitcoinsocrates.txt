Will this help the price on the Kraken exchange follow the other exchanges quicker?

Bitcoin gets publicity, which is cool.

Is that so? I didn't know that was the case. Could you please link me some place to read about that?


I'm guessing you deduced that from [this]( comment. However, a thought I've had regarding the bitcoin tech being adopted is that it could lead to more awareness of bitcoin in a major way, attracting more people to bitcoin's monetary aspect. Bitcoin tech adoption and currency adoption don't necessarily have to be unrelated in this aspect. I think speculating on bitcoin tech adoption helping currency adoption isn't so far fetched. I don't know if that's his thought.

I'm assuming a higher price means higher momentum, overall. Obviously the momentum is higher than it was back when it was 1200. But if the momentum is saturated with the price, that is, if the market has found the right price, then a higher price is obviously going to mean more volume because there is more adoption. Did you not think that higher adoption of the bitcoin currency would mean higher price?

It's a reddit link, incase you're worried and that's why you don't want to click it. Decipher of my meaning: Theymos is anything but competent.

Do you understand what I mean by this?:




Are you thinking that the more adoption the lower price? According to my deduction, converting to dollars just causes downward pressure on the momentum, what do you think of that?


What did you mean to say by that?

Interesting, thanks. Do you happen to know how they go about shorting? And any other details?

Coinbase is an example of where the price of bitcoin *does* matter to revenue. Because the higher the price the higher the volume and thus that 1% rate they charge will be a higher number.


It creates an increase in the market momentum, which puts platforms for the price. So it does give a rise in price as opposed to if the adoption wasn't there. The price platform(s) would've been lower.

How do bitcoin businesses fare if bitcoin deflates? (no pun intended)

If anything, "stepping down" to make this blow over *could* be in his interest. "Stepping down" = giving control to someone who he's behind. How's that for practical?
Edit: I say, as a community, let's be critical and wary of this possibility if Theymos does step down. A new admin should follow criteria such as not having ties with Theymos and already being a longterm trusted member of this community, is what I'm thinking.

How is the value of goods determined by the dollar?


And wouldn't you say that the more customers using a service, the more revenue? Why are you talking about the 1% cost changing?
