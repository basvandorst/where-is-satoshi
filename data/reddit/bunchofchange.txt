I get what you're saying. But let's say he did do Segwit to Segwit. $5 bucks for a $20 purchase is still a 25% fee. 
Then again, I did not mention the initial price of the drinks he bought, so I assume that was just an example or a flat rate?

Friend told me was gonna dip to 16 cents tonight and level out at $50K tomorro. Hope he rite :)

Sorry about the typo in the title. Voice to text is a bitch

Wait, hold on just one second. Wasn't bitcoin (in the beginning, and maybe even now) so hellbent on the fact that the general public dismissed you? That no one would take a crypto currency seriously?
Why is this same sentiment not applied to the other crpyto that is coming up in the world? It doesn't make sense to me.

That toy Lamborghini looks awfully realistic! However, the dyecast ones go for about $30 bucks, so maybe a hot wheels model? Regardless, I love the optimism !

Stop taking it personally. There have been countless threads on here. I apologize that this isn't a meme regarding "TO DA MOON!" and actually a post as to why someone like myself is no longer invested in this currency. The average, everyday person who really wanted to use this as a way to pay for things.

Think of how the first part of a roller coaster looks...

Banks aren't going anywhere. That's what people need to understand. Ripple is the ideal middle ground, which is why it's dominating. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:37:42
That’s what I’m saying 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:42:04
Ripple works as a currency. BTC doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:01:22
Correct. But even when it hit 2K, weren't people saying it's a bubble and going to crash?
It seems as though this mindset will never leave.

I posted a thread about high fees and it was removed. My plan was quite short sighted. I'm not sure how you all saw through it. 
I posted it because..... the fees are REALLY FUCKING HIGH
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:56:01
You're aware that the people who bought a few hundred bucks worth of XVG last year are now millionaires, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:50:52
Go after them all you want, but this community should be shitting itself. I know, I know. "HODL", but most people don't think that way who are new to this. Perhaps if it functioned like the lightning fast currency with low fees that it's made out to be, users would believe it's worth the price. 
Even this sub, who bans anyone for disagreeing is freaking out. These fees are TOO DAMN HIGH. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:30
This could be true. Thankfully the fee to transfer a coin will only be 49,999
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:12
You're acting like it was heroin
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:31:40
Neither did ripple...

Funny statement, coming from the guys on here that see their currency plummet and go "But it's up XX% since last month!"
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:15:29
Please remove this, it’s offensive 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:42
That the one that's got $30 fees?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:57
How are people excited over the prices going down? What happens when they rise again? I don't really know how this works but if the problem of high fees and transactions isn't being fixed, I would not be celebrating the dip in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:46:37
In a few years time, just wait and see which currency is being used more. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:59:09
They’re not, but bitcoin is being removed all across these platforms as a use of payment. So unless something changes, they will step in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:08
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:26:43
Makes sense. I'm learning a ton on here. 
So, what is stopping lightning from being implemented? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:46:51
Not long, but that's not the point. The point is that if I was in this when the fees were negligible and the transaction times were fast, I'd be like "Dude, why would you sell? This currency works flawlessly".
Look at steam. They no longer accept it! I mean, you guys are begging for a fix for these things but it seems as though it's falling of deaf ears.
I really want bitcoin to win but this just doesn't look good.
And plus, if the only way benefits you is if you've been holding for a long time... that tells you everything you need to know.
I am focusing on it's practicality, you know? Everything backing it's value. Not "GAINZZZ"
I guess I don't really know what happened. It went from "Decentralized currency! We're gonna change the world!" to "Forget the speed and cost, man. GAINZZ! TO THE MOON!!!!"
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:38
Holy hell. I had no idea ripple got that high. I got in at .70 - Not too bad 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:41
But not to those who hodl
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:49:28
I agree that patience is a virtue and you make a good point with compromising it's security, yet it seems like in the world of Crypto Currencies, everyone is moving at such a rapid pace. Developing new tech, ect  - that, you really don't have that much time to mess around.
Did most of the devs / users know this was going to happen and wait until zero hour or?
