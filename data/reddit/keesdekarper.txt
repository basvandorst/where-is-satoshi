Only scamcoin atm is bitcoin. Literally no reason to buy into it

Terribly translated quote. Completely lost it's (sort of) clever meaning

I mean its pretty obvious we disagree, you think sticking to bitcoin is the better idea. I dont just follow everyone and put my money in shitty technology, I'd rather do some research and pick coins I actually think have a future, instead of "HODL  BUY BITCOIN, $1m NEXT YEAR".
And i completely agree, not all of the coins i pick will succeed, but if only one of them even comes close to bitcoins current market cap ill be set for life.

Die quote werkt niet echt in engels. Dat is alles wat ik probeer te zeggen :)

Oh definitely some huge potential in some alts

No offense, just a genuine question. 
But you said i am increasing risks by investing in these smaller currencies. Do you actually believe bitcoin is at a good price right now? 
Personally I wouldnt be surprised if it dropped to 1000 in no time. If you buy a good growing coin however (starting really small) you can easily make tons without investing much

Im not invested in either of those. And before I buy i do look at roadmap whitepaper and some general information about the people behind the project and partnerships. 
Not saying I understand the entire development process, but at the very least im aware of whats going on with the coin in the bigger picture

Mining bitcoin is shit. If you are new, i suggest and nicehash.com
nicehash automatically switches between most profitable mining algorithms, and is super easy to set up. They do take a 2% fee though IIRC

incredibly unlikely. Its actually funny how people in this subreddit mass upvote blind optimism like this because they want to believe it
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:42
its at 14k. unless theres a huge price correction its pretty fair to assume it will stay well above 10k for now

Alts are where theres room for growth. You can say whatever you want, but for its current use cases bitcoin is heavily overvalued.
If you find a promising altcoin that has a small marketcap and seems like it has good use cases. Go invest in that, can easily 10x in a couple months if you pick the right one. Whereas if you invest in bitcoin I would be surprised if it 5x's before 2019

Doing pretty well so far. Much better than i would've if i kept all my money in bitcoin. Not just one lucky hit either, but 5 coins that grew well over 100%
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:16:06
classic pyramid/ponzi. This isnt what bitcoin aims to be. If you want that just go buy bitconnect
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:42:21
To be fair. Bitcoin can lose value much harder than that car in some cases (last week for instance)
