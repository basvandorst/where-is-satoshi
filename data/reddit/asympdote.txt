Watching this made me realise how much more important it is now, since big companies are coming around, to practice explaining bitcoin in terms comprehensible to the widest possible audience. I've fucked it up a few times, and each of those times I must have sounded like Herbert &amp; Kaiser here - in attempting to explain too much, too quickly, and too excitedly. Perhaps the best way is to drip feed the minimum of info (e.g. "it's the internet of money") and then guage whether or not the other had understood this idea first instead of flooding them. Personally I've found that this way works better.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:43:37


I could follow you until you wrote this, which makes no sense to me. Would you care to expand? How does explicitly equal amounts of value leaving and reentering btc equate to a decrease in the overall valuation of btc? Isn't bitcoin (like all commodities) valued on the fundemental laws of scarcity in relation to supply/demand?
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:39:22
It's interesting that you make a distinction between "hype" and "good news". For me, good news includes hype, e.g. Paypal's CEO conceding that bitcoin will have to be integrated into their services - what purpose would such an announcement serve, while nothing concrete has become of this, other than hype? Perhaps you mean _novelty_ instead of hype. That I would agree with: the novelty factor of bitcoin is lessening daily. But this doesn't work in cycles. The novelty value of bitcoin only appears once and then tails off. If this is true then something really dramatic needs to happen to demand for there to be a steady price rise.

So they've set up a "segregated client funds trustee agreement", which would keep client funds out of reach from their creditors were they to go bust. 
I wonder if Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc. have this sort of agreement or not? After Gox I would have thought this ought to be standard.

@_date: 2014-07-17 10:15:48
OK, but then shouldn't that translate into price stability, at the least? If bitcoin is sold instantly for fiat through these high-volume gateway mechanisms, and the spenders then top-up on the bitcoin they'd just spent, then wouldn't that cancel-out/lessen the downward pressure? If this is not the case, then, it would follow that Big Business adoption isn't such a positive thing for bitcoin investment; it would, on the contrary, be a positive for fiat investment, would it not?

I've donated to Darkwallet and have bought ether too, because I value transaction privacy and smart contract production. Both projects are worthy of support. And neither are mutually exclusive. Is this really so hard to accept?

Yes it's trustless, in principle, but in practice this has been proven to be fragile (have you forgotten about gHash so soon?). Control of the blockchain is distributed across the network in constantly varying degrees of centralisation and decentralisation at once - not either/or.

I understood what you sketched as price elasticity (I may be wrong, as I'm now drawing on the cinders of secondary school business studies...). But I don't see how the concept tranfers meaningfully from either of your examples to bitcoin. Humans _need_ medicine and fuel, so we buy them even at overtly inflated and extortionate prices or else our lives breakdown. Bitcoin is a commodity and currency that does not enter into this framework of human need. 
How much do you want to bet on there not being a price explosion next week... and the week after that?
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:59:37

I perfectly understand what you're saying, but "the moment" in question has lasted a year for me. To reiterate my point: it used to be predictable and now it now longer is; we used to be be able to see an instant spike after good news but now we don't. The moment encompasses both these cases. And it is a fact even if the explanations for it being so remain moot.

@_date: 2014-12-27 09:10:37
Why is there zero discussion of the actual issues here (instead of ad homs against Wilson)? 
TBF is not a problem in itself. Many open source projects benefit from coordination by a foundation group, like the Linux foundation for instance. Whether or not it is beneficial or harmful to the project however comes down to what it actually does. 
Wilson has presented evidence that members of TBF have acted in support of the Bitlicence proposal in its original form as a matter of fact.
If you oppose this position then it's in your interest to support Wilson's campaign. If you don't have a problem with it then ignore.

It's not about Satoshi but the work he left behind and what it was always meant for. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a hot new instrument for Wall St or to generate more wannabe-banks. If you don't understand this then you don't understand where bitcoin came from our why it exists.

Yes, but the value of leaks is not financial. Neither Manning nor Snowden did what they did for monetary reward. There simply are more important reasons at stake.
