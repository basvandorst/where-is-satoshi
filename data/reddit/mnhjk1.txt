Yes, I'm sure the way you see the world is reality, and I'm just delusional. I'm glad that you can discern my whole life from no information, you must be really clever! You have an essentially flawed view of charity - they don't all exist to alleviate poverty, but to provide services not adequately provided by the state and free market. You can donate however, and to whomever, you choose - it doesn't change the fact that your attitude is horrible. Insulting me based on what you perceive to be my situation does you no good.

Because supply and demand don't exist when using Bitcoin? And people don't have to work anymore, and everyone's decisions on consumption will be different..? If it is used as money, economics applies 
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:10:41
Well yeah - I just don't think an unproven, ideologically driven piece of technology with a volatile value is a good one for charities. Fair enough if it is a business - but charities exist to provide essential services to those in need. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:09:39
That's ridiculous - I can go and buy milk, bread etc. at a shop for basically the same price, everyday, in fiat. This is not true of Bitcoin hour to hour.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:06:40
You absolutely can - I just think its a borderline cultish way of thinking. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:57:22
This attitude is what makes me uncomfortable with Bitcoin - it is not a charities job to endorse and advertise your pet project, and you are not better placed to assess their needs than them. Charities exist to help people, not speculate on unproven technology 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:37:08
Again - they are not begging. There are people in the world who recognize that they have been privileged in ways other haven't, and endeavour to help those people. They are Philanthropists. The attitude you have towards charity is literally Victorian. Perhaps the world its far worse off for not having benefited from your benevolence - I suspect the actual impact of anything you have done is minuscule however, and so you get to dictate dick all.

So you see no legitimate reason a charity would not accept Bitcoin? I think you want charities to accept Bitcoins because it would be good for you, not for them. Beyond that, I think you overestimate the number of people clamouring to give to charity in Bitcoin who would refuse to do so in fiat. The combative 'with us or against us' attitude is not going to make people adopt Bitcoin, you need an honest dialogue.

I have no problem with charities accepting Bitcoin - its the implication that people decide which charity to donate to based on whether or not they accept Bitcoin that I'm uncomfortable with. Surely such decisions should be made based on the cause and effectiveness of the charity, rather than whether they support an emerging technology. Other people have pointed to very good reasons why some charities would be unwilling or unable to do so - are they worse than other charities purely by virtue of that? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:18:48
I think you're confusing me with an actual charity - I am not one, nor so I speak for them. I have no issue with charities taking Bitcoin or not - I just think if you decide which charity to donate to based on whether or not they accept Bitcoin, you are exposing an ulterior motive - you are not donating to help a cause, but to advertise Bitcoin. You may have no problem with that, I just think its a selfish and shitty way to help those in need. Your language and attitude betray this - charities are not beggars, and they can absolutely be choosers - they provide a not-for-profit service where the free market and state have failed to support those in need. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:47:38
No, you just have a very nasty way of looking at things - charities fulfill a number of vital functions, some with nothing to do with poverty - e.g. children's charities, cancer charities. These are not beggars, they are important services that we all benefit from, that are not supported enough by the free market or the state. Perhaps you need to stop getting all ruled up, and think compassionately rather than selfishly.

People have been claiming this since the 70's though - hyperinflation is imminent, the dollar will collapse. And yet the dollar continues to have stable inflation. You cannot say with certainty that Bitcoin will stabilise, as it is impossible to know whether it will even be legal, let alone widely adopted. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:26:27
No, I agree with that argument - the volatility disincentivises people from entering the market, but those already in the market will not exit if there is a reasonable expectation the price will rise due to deflation. The volatility makes it hard to discern whether it is on an upwards or downwards trend.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:37:26
Which is true only if it succeeds - it is deflationary only if people adopt it, which volatility is a barrier to. If people abandon bitcoin, it is irrelevant if it is designed to be deflationary or not. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:20:39
Agreed - as long as the volatility continues in an upward trend, which is unclear
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:48:11
No, they don't - volatility allows traders to speculate on Bitcoin short-term, but doesn't stimulate spending due to the uncertainty of future price movements. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:08:57
Currently it is unstable,
if it succeeds it will be deflationary
