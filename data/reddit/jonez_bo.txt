Then you lose. And so does everyone else.
As the financial system collapses everyone around you starves. 
Your friends.
Your family. 
Your girlfriend.
Your kids.
Riots break out in the streets and criminals with guns start looting and burning things.
Martial law is enforced and your rights as a citizen are stripped.
Every convenience and luxury you enjoy today disappears. 
No internet
No electricity
No clean water
No shops
No commerce
Just anarchy and death. 
And all because you HODL’d for a lambo.

There’s a battle on for the soul of Bitcoin. 
How would you describe yourself? Are you a capitalist?
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:31:09
Most of this is backwards. 
The 'Crypto Industry' is profoundly corrupt. 
What you believe about banks, governments and money is political opinion. 
We're going to issue Fiat currencies like dollars and pounds on the Bitcoin blockchain as well as stocks, bonds, guilts, securities, shares, derivatives, options, mortgages, licences, identity documents, wills, and everything you can imagine from websites to video catalogues. 
The entire 'crypto industry' is going to collapse down into the Bitcoin blockchain until there's only one protocol left. 
The government will not censor bitcoin. They will not stop you from buying and selling it. 
They will also not stop taxing you, starting wars, or printing money. 
Banks will continue to make loans, and issue credit cards. 
The world will go on, with Bitcoin, running under the surface, organising everything with an immutable evidence trail.
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:23:30
The way this actually works in reality (if you have any interest in how reality works, is...)
1. Countries tokenise their currencies and issue them on top of the bitcoin blockchain. 
2. These currencies are widely used to pay employees.
3. Every payment can then be audited by internal and external auditors to verify how much has been paid by a company to each employee for each job
4. As it says in the whitepaper: IDENTITY IS FIREWALLED BY NEVER REUSING ADDRESSES
5. When the auditors review Volvos books, they can see how much has been paid for cobalt mining, when, for how much cobalt, where the cobalt went and how it was used all the way up the supply chain to the consumer 
6. Leaving the identity of the person paid protected from the outside.
This happens at scale, and only at scale, when governments and banks are included in the bitcoin economy. 
It only works on the original version of the protocol with very large blocks.

The price of Bitcoin is being profoundly manipulated, although the manipulations benefit the manipulators, so in a sense you don't need to worry about it... or at least, you wouldn't need to worry about it, if the whole space wasn't profoundly corrupt. Most of the crypto 'news' sites are lying about everything. Mostly they're ignorant and trying to make profit, but a lot of the industry is criminal and based on criminal profits, and the spinning up of fraudulent token scams designed to rip people off, launder money and make sociopathic 'entrepreneurs' with no real products overnight millionaires. 
Surely this is obvious to you. 
It's true that 'bitcoin' is an honest system of money, but the honesty on which it is predicated is the transparency with which it operates. And it has long been abused for the sake of profit, so don't expect some miraculous 'alternative' system that brings enlightenment, peace and prosperity anytime soon. There's a war on for the heart and soul of this technology, (in case you hadn't noticed).

Ok so, you can still hold your Bitcoin. Nothing changes that. But the point is that you still pay taxes in dollars, still pay for things at bars, restaurants and shops in dollars right?
So nothing changes there either. You hold Bitcoin, you pay in dollars. The only difference is that your Bitcoin is worth a lot more when it’s being used to issue and settle the dollars you use every day.

I think it’s likely to happen because it would save them so much money. A digital dollar is a digital dollar, but when it’s interoperable with other currencies at no cost it’s like a dream come true for managing your economy. That’s why I think it’s likely, because it brings operating costs down so far it will actually cost them NOT to migrate to a common standard with everyone else.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:41:38
But I think that’s because you haven’t really grasped that the value of the USD would float against the value of Bitcoin. You’d have a real, deep, liquid derivatives market to keep it stable, backed by the tax payer and the guarantee of the federal government and by the value of the petrodollar. 
The only thing the Chinese have a big stake in is mining bitcoin, and they’re incentivised not to try and cheat...
You’re mistaking two different things. The US would still govern their own fiscal policy and manage the price of their fiat dollar token, by inflating it at 2% a year in line with the other advanced economies, just like they do today.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:04:18
Ok so again, here’s the issue: a government doesn’t print money. A government is a temporary thing that lasts four years. Every election cycle they make promises, bigger promises than the other side, and then if they’re elected they have to fund those promises.
So they are in a perpetual spending war with each other, trying to get power. They have to raise bonds from the Fed and the Treasury prints the money. The government doesn’t control the monetary system. The Fed does, and the Fed is run by a collection of state banks. 
They issue digital dollars... all the time. But they issue them on different databases. They have no really reliable way of tracking their loans in real time, so they have no idea how much the retail banks are loaning out. So there’s a lot of fraud in the system, which costs a lot of money. It’s inefficient, it causes breakdowns in trust and ultimately costs the economy a lot. 
Crucially: they’re not ‘giving up control’ by issuing USD on bitcoin, but ‘taking control’ of their assets properly. Do you see? And the consequence of this is that the value of your bitcoin goes up massively.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:19:05
The Fed and retail banks all issue digital dollars as IOUs but the entire system rests on accurate auditing. So for example, if I’m the Fed I might loan a billion dollars to a retail bank, and they might then loan out 10 billion dollars to Main Street in the form of credit IOUs.
All of these IOUs are ‘dollars’. They’re just entries in a database. When the IOUs are repaid, the debt is destroyed, and the interest is returned to the bank and the Fed. 
Trust makes the economy work, if it works at all. 
The problem is that all these different IOU systems are built on different databases. So you don’t actually know if any given bank is loaning out more than they’re supposed to. 
Bitcoin solves this because it’s a public ledger, but only insofar as assets issued on Bitcoin can be freely audited by anyone. This is a fundamental value proposition for society.
@_date: 2019-12-25 04:09:06
Satoshi has something to say about this. Reading over his posts at  he talks about a pay to IP function he put in because he wanted to see it used by services like Amazon. 
But amazon sells mostly object ‘things’ not data, you know. I don’t think this ‘digital gold’ thing makes much sense when you consider that bitcoin could be used for micropayments too.
@_date: 2019-12-29 07:17:45
You’ve got a problem with understanding reality. Everywhere I travel in this globe people are using their local currency. Those currencies are used to pay taxes and provide infrastructure for the local population. 
This will not change. 
But: a single global currency protocol would mean faster, better trade between countries. 
It’s evident that USDT and USDC work as models. So much so that it’s reasonable to suggest that a stablecoin issuer like Tether could at some point, become a bank, a retail bank. 
Once that happens Tether is, for all intents and purposes the USD. If it settles on bitcoin, then that proves my point. 
I don’t see what your problem is other than you clearly have no idea how the world works and are probably very young and naive.
Most of what you’ve said here is shit.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:04:40
Satoshi could reveal the non standard nonce and the number generator he used to code the genesis block. That would destroy the whole project in an instant.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:48:19
Not if they could cooperate and make more money though. That’s the interesting model proposed by Satoshi with PoW mining. The players don’t perform 51% attacks on each other, because if they assemble that much hash power, its more profitable for them to help the network. 
The same applies to issuing assets on chain. Because the chain is transparent, you can see who’s attacking you. So if your enemy attacks you, you fuck them.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:05:46
Yes but Bitcoin isn’t probably what you think it is. Most people think it’s a store of value for large value transfers which is censorship resistant but... the decentralised aspect has been misunderstood and it’s not ‘completely decentralised’ but rather decentralised from a market perspective. 
The thing is: it does empower people and will empower people, but not in the way most believe. That is, it’s a global protocol *for* money, for any money, and it doesn’t get rid of banks and governments. 
Instead, if a bank or government wants to issue their cash on bitcoin, they’ll be able to, and it will be extremely low cost for them to do it. Digital pounds and dollars, on bitcoin. 
And that brings down the cost of banking and money services, which in turn will really empower people. But it’s a long road. It won’t happen overnight and we have a lot of educating to do before people learn and begin to understand.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:43:43
OK so the dollars’ value used to be ‘backed by gold’. They’d be redeemable for a little gold. And now they’re sort of backed by energy security in the Middle East: basically ‘PetroDollars’, guaranteed by the US Military to keep oil prices stable. 
The main reason for the change was that by the end of the gold exchange standard the US had virtually no gold left, because they guaranteed the dollar with gold. Everyone simply cashed in and took the gold, and the US had to switch to the system we use today. What do people want? Energy. Cheap Energy. 
So the power of the US dollar is backed by the promise of cheap energy, but... guess what? So is Bitcoin. Only it’s backed by ‘cheaper and cheaper energy’ because you need to use cheaper and cheaper forms of energy to win the Proof of Work competition. 
And so that makes it a pretty direct competitor with the USD. USD is an analogue currency, it can’t compete. But it doesn’t have to. Taxes can still be demanded in USD to give it value and the US can insist on the world market paying for Oil in dollars for as long as they have political power, but no one really trusts them anymore... 
By issuing their dollars on the bitcoin blockchain they do need to buy a little bit of bitcoin for each one. 1 Satoshi for example, to keep track of that dollar on the chain. And here’s the interesting part: say a Satoshi is worth 1 cent. But it backs 1 dollar USD, the more backing it has, the more the Satoshi goes up in value. And the more people buy bitcoin, so the higher the value of the Satoshi backing the USD.
Theoretically, it would eventually reach parity, where one Satoshi equalled one dollar, but you have to start small...

No I’m not purposefully mixing those two things up. I understand they’re different things. But there’s no need for a mempool, not for every user node to have every UTXO set.

@_date: 2019-12-20 15:01:24
The mempool was added in 2013 and is completely unnecessary because of the double hash and the Merkle tree structure which means you can send transactions direct around a peer network as long as you include the Merkle path. 
That means you don’t need to worry about large UTXO sets propagating equally across all the nodes in the network. Blocks can catch up later.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:14:42
Ah but there’s the problem with ‘just using bitcoin’ called ‘stagflation’. People don’t *spend* bitcoin, because it’s deflationary. This is a well known fact. The issue with any hard money like gold is that productivity slows down as people consume less, because they know their money will be worth more tomorrow. It’s an incentive to save, not to spend. So an economy with only hard money fails, because no one buys anything. So you need both. 
The other problem is that a sovereign government shouldn’t give up its fiscal responsibility to its citizens. In other words, you should be able to trust that the value of your nations money is stable and that everyone will accept it. So there’s no good reason to stop using dollars at all. 
What you want to do however, is send dollars to Tokyo, have them changed for Yen, then sent to London as Pounds and  then instantly sent back to New York  as dollars again. And that can be done on Bitcoin. 
And again, it only increases the value of your bitcoin, by many orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2019-12-22 08:19:35
Wouldn’t it be weird if Satoshi was still hanging around though? Checking out all of Bitcoin’s progress and figuring out how to get it to scale globally. He’d have a huge amount of money to help him analyse it and loads of resources to build advanced mining facilities. 
It’s kind of strange he’s never said anything in public about it.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:16:19
The problem is that when/if Bitcoin becomes really anonymous and the entire bitcoin economy goes dark, government will panic and shut down the exchanges. 
Bitcoin’s a razor sharp balance between public and private. If the government wants to shut exchanges down because the drug market is too large, they can. 
So probably not a brilliant store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:18:31

Yeh. Nixon couldn’t afford to keep bombing Vietnam because the gold exchange standard meant the nations of the world robbed America of its gold. That’s what happens when you back paper with gold. It doesn’t work because people just take the gold. 
And USD can continue as a digital asset on chain. The main thing about debt is this: if your government owes another government a lot of money and they don’t pay it back, then you can expect some kind of tension or war, but otherwise it’s just inflation. It just gets sucked up into the supply and demand cycle. 
And btw Saifedean’s book is amateur hour.

The US Navy created TOR to shield their communications with assets in foreign territories. The idea was that the more traffic there was on TOR from other sources the easier it would be to hide their own communications. 
And here’s the thing. The US Navy is tasked to protect you (if you’re an American citizen) and the rest of the NATO-pact countries, so they’re hardly they enemy’ (unless you are a Terrorist) and more or less the same thing applies to the NSA. 
They invented SHA256 to be a cast iron encryption algorithm because...guess what... they’re tasked with protecting secret military communications responsible for defending the nation, the lives of their troops, top military command and the president. 
So: let’s consider what that means. This is the most well funded and largest encryption making and breaking service in history.
They’ve got a reputation to protect. 
They’d look pretty fucking stupid if the Russians or Chinese broke their shit.

Venezuela’s government is not just corrupt but absolutely criminal. They’re unbelievably naive. They’ve completely mismanaged their economy. That’s a bad example of a government managing a currency. 
Some currencies (and some governments) suck. The US is extremely competent by comparison. 
And as for losing 95% of its value, it doesn’t do that over a few months does it? But bitcoin has halved in value since May. Do you think people want to use a volatile deflationary asset from one week to the next? Do you think they *can* (for business, for anything)? (Hint: They can’t) 
I know you want to believe that bitcoin only goes up in value. And that if everyone used it as money then everything would be amazing. But that’s not how it works. Stagflation kills economies dead. 
So you need both. A government issued fiat currency and an underlying asset that floats.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:18:43
If you’re saying that when the price of BTC is really really high (like say, $100,000 or $1,000,000 each) that exchanges won’t matter (maybe because we have ‘decentralised exchanges’ DEXs) or because everyone will just ‘accept bitcoin’ and we’ll have a ‘voluntary society’ or an Ancap society, I’m afraid you’d better learn some more economics. 
Deflationary currencies cause stagflation in economies and therefore don’t work. People are unwilling to spend if the value of their money keeps going up, and that causes the economy to stop. (Money needs to have a stable-in-relation-to-goods-and-services value for people to use it and spend it and make the economy grow). Secondly any deflationary asset will bubble in price and then collapse as speculators buy and sell the limited-in-supply asset to make profit, so exchanges will always exist, be it Bitcoin for gold or Bitcoin for TESLA stock, or Bitcoin for government issued fiat money. 
Which brings me into what gives government issued fiat value... A government issued money gets inherent demand from its status as legal tender. That means citizens can (and must) pay their taxes in the currency issued by their government. 
So government fiat money will always exist, because governments will always exist to create and govern human societies. 
If you imagine that when the price of bitcoin goes very high, governments will crumble because people will stop using their money... I’m afraid you’re wrong. Price does not topple government. If the price gets too high,  speculators dump the market on retail investors and the poorest go broke. 
Finally, the point of bitcoin is so that governments can issue their fiat cash on chain so that we can move to a ‘paperless economy’ where fraud, counterfeiting and hyperinflation can’t happen without the public knowing about it.
Bitcoin is a very sophisticated auditing technology for governments and citizens, on which every type of financial instrument can be issued. It’s ‘the internet of money’. 
And there’ll always be exchanges.

Is it though? Or is it just a pyramid token scheme that can’t be shut down because it’s decentralised? 
Tokens aren’t new. Pyramids aren’t new. And if anonymity is actually realised in BTC the chances are drug sales will go through the roof, the price will rocket up, before Interpol and Europol and all the other international police agencies gang up together and close down the exchanges, at which point the bubble will burst and the price will literally fall to zero. Overnight. 
Police agencies don’t generally like crime you know. And countries do cooperate together to stop common threats. 
My guess is that BTC won’t hold out forever. Exchanges are the weakest link in the event that the BTC economy grows too large.

lol. That’s a really good point actually. I hadn’t thought of that but it’s true. SHA256 is a hashing algo for producing digests.

From 1980 to 2000 gold went from $2400 to $400 per ounce. When were you born? From 1930 to 1970 it went from $800 to $100 per ounce. 
Gold is decentralised and it’s deflationary. There’s a very good reason why we don’t use gold as money in daily life; because if you were paid in an asset that falls in value by that much, over that time frame you’d starve. 
Look at the chart again and really understand what that means. 
Finally: I never said ‘you can’t have bitcoin’. What I said was does anyone have anything against getting rich from issuing USD on bitcoin? And you... apparently don’t like dollars, governments or the US.

I think it’s highly likely. Imagine 60 years ago saying ‘governments will never accept COBOL as a computer language for banking’ ... it’s like... well they have no choice. Because that’s what we use. That’s what works. 
Same principle applies here. You want one global database for money and one operating system for global finance? It’s Bitcoin. It already happened. 
And miners in China? Well, you’re still talking about security not price, and the Chinese have no incentive to undermine the security... if.... (drum roll).... they issue Chinese Yuan on bitcoin. 
Which is exactly what they look like their gearing up to doing with their whole ‘embrace the blockchain’ campaign.

Wait... I don’t see your logic here. Keynesian economics is a credit based system of soft money and Hayek’s system is hard money based on limited supply commodities like Gold. 
But the Keynesian system evolved out of credit notes issued for gold. One emerges from the other and in this case, the ‘credit system goes back to hard money’ it returns again, only this time the ‘gold’ is digital, yes? 
I don’t see that it takes a century to issue bitcoin backed dollars. Remember this is a competitive race amongst nations for who can integrate fastest, and make the most profit. It won’t take 100 years. It might take 20. It could take 10 to get USD issued on bitcoin.

Wait wait, USD isn’t deflationary. That’s wrong. It’s an inflationary fiat currency so I don’t know where you’re getting that from. Seriously. It’s inflationary. 
The money supply is elastic so people tend to spend on goods which are made possible (TVs etc.) by virtue of the fact that credit flows in the economy allow for those goods to even exist in the first place. 
So as for trust goes, we actually do always trust our governments every day, from day to day, not to mismanage the value of what’s in our pockets, so that a pint of milk costs roughly the same in January as it does in December (roughly). 
So moving on: my point about it being ‘backed’ by bitcoin is that if you wanted to alter the balance of your USD account, you’d actually have to pay for that change with bitcoin, and you’d have to pay for the transfer of USD (tokens) in or out of your account with bitcoin. 
So rather than fleeing from USD to Bitcoin, bitcoin is actually needed in the real economy for shifting and changing people’s balances. 
Again, if you hold bitcoin it will go up in value through constant institutional usage.

I think you’re mistaking price for value. The value proposition of BTC has seemed strongest since 2017, but what if money were just IOUs? Would you trust an IOU that had no details of the parties? Anonymous IOUs don’t really work as you get the same problem as you do with the dollar (an ‘anon’ IOU) - massive undercover inflation. 
Nope. BTC looks like a classic bubble. I might go up again, but it doesn’t do the hard job Bitcoin was designed to do. 2020 will be an interesting year of learning.

Internet of money means you can send any kind of money over bitcoin. (It’s programmable) it also means you can send any other kind of financial asset over bitcoin, be it a certificate of gold ownership, stock, bond, derivative, equity, currency, contract etc. Or anything that otherwise has value, be it a licence, passport, letter of assurance or indemnity, mortgage, etc. and *transfer ownership* of that asset to someone else. 
So the propaganda really is true. Think about it this way: when USD are issued on top of the bitcoin blockchain, you could send USD to people in Iran or HK, and they could keep it on their phone instead of keeping it in the bank; and exchange it for local Iranian or Chinese currency, or anything else of value. 
That’s censorship resistance AND interoperability with the legacy system, which is a much more powerful idea than people realise. 
But... how long will it take for the USD to be issued ‘on chain’? Privately issued 1:1 backed stablecoins like tether are already available and easy to use but they have some problems. 
You can send ‘raw bitcoin’ and just measure it in dollars and pounds, but that has problems too.
