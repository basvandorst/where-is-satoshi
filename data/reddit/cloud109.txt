Yep, the backup phrases will work with any private key your wallet generates. You shouldn’t ever need to re backup unless you loose your original backup.

This is the conversation I had with support: Hello! Within the past year we received an email from you requesting a Bitcoin payment option. I am writing to give you some great news - We now accept Bitcoin payments for premium subscriptions! You can use this payment option by visiting  and using the upgrade option. We appreciate you letting us know you'd like to see this payment option so we could continue to improve for our users. Rock on!

Thank you for your interest in Grooveshark. That really means a lot to us. Unfortunately, we do not support Bitcoin payments. We accept credit cards and PayPal.
We have a very small development team, especially when it comes to billing, and I would not categorize any site wide change as easy. I would be happy to make certain our development and managerial teams are aware of the benefits of adding support for Bitcoin. I think it is definitely something we would like to support. I apologize for the hassle and inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I would like to help.

Would there be anyway that you could start accepting bitcoin? Its super easy and you can be paid out in USD and most other currencies daily through these merchant services: and/or There are no fees for the first million in coinbase (after there are only 1% fees) and there are 1 percent fees for the free plan on bitpay and no fees on there 20$ a month option. There are no possible chargebacks too! Please consider accepting these payment options! They include super easy to use apis and even a button if you wanted to manually approve the payment. Its the only way for me to pay at the moment. if you don't add it as a option for everyone could you just accept it from me? Thanks!

Email Them!!! That's why so many companies including grooveshark started accepting bitcoin. You can copy my message and edit out the grooveshark part but give them a shout!

Awesome! Hopefully they were bought when btc was at 1200

Only thing they lack imo is curation of playlists
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:53:18
Of course! 
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:18:05
If there holding that would be so cool! I think there believers 
Edit: Apparently they are exchanging for USD and using stripe for payments.

It's great that your expanding your gift card selection but when is canada coming to gyft? I heard it was early 2014 but it has not happened yet. Thanks for your support to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:11:33
