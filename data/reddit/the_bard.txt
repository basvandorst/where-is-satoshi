Because the fact that an exchange can just disappear overnight with all the money on it doesn't exactly lead to investor confidence.

Well just days ago people were still buying coins on gox so you tell me

Well all rhetoric aside its the reason for lenders of last resort, aka 'bailouts'

Everything you said is pure speculation and would likely land people in jail if it were true.

Maybe I'm not following but since most bitcoins are held as investment wouldn't liquidity of that nature reduce the price?

And if all merchants accepted bitcoin the hoarding would stop and value would decrease as supply increased and hoarded coins were spent. In the long run the goals of investment and currency for bitcoin are incompatible.

I thought about it but the original message was posted 2/7. Its 11 days later and still can't withdraw...

Gold is a known  commodity and sells well so that would be similar to a bitcoin. Cars are a risk and the price is highly, highly, variable. It would be easy to sell for the value, that's the point. Its a quick buck to anyone who knows anything about bitcoin.

There will be another bubble because its being treated like a commodity more than a currency. Commodities will always be highly variable in price in the short term.

Car prices are highly fungible though. When there is something that will sell for $800 (or whatever the price may be) with little effort  it will go for very close to that value.

All currencies are traded at small margins in high volume. Bitcoin is being treated as a commodity. If it were treated as a currency the price would stabilize not grow exponentially.

The Internet was down more often 20 years ago. 13 years ago it was just as reliable, in fact it was better if you had broadband because few people did so you got amazing uncapped speeds.

There is a difference between 'using' bitcoin and saving bitcoins for speculative purposes. Very very few of the vendors that accept bitcoin actually accept bitcoin. They process the bitcoin to USD transaction through coinbase. So if everyone is 'using' bitcoin in this way but hardly anyone is saving it the value well be nothing close to $1,000 each. Like I said initially making it a ubiquitous currency is incompatible with the goal of investing in bitcoin for the long term.

No? 95%+ of coins are unused and being held as investments. If coins can be used everywhere they won't be hoarded at the same rate. Vendors don't want bitcoins for the most part so every coin spent will create a sell order. So the supply increases with less coins being held and each one spent creates a sell order. Its simple supply and demand. The market would be flooded with sell orders.By comparison the average savings rate in the US is around 5%, so its not much of a comparison. Also not too many people hoarding dollars in the hopes the value goes up exponentially like they are with bitcoins. Its a totally different animal.

One of the biggest issues in determining value is that most bitcoins are being held and not used as currency. The value will change drastically if it is used regularly as every day currency.
