How do you lock an account?

I wanted to start selling BTC instead of just selling to people who advertise to buy, because there are not many SWIFT bank transfer offers and the best price is 10% worse than at Bitstamp.

Thank you so much! This is something I've been looking for! I'm going to give them a try.

Sure, but do you actually know any exchange that allow withdrawing fiat without having your passport scan?


And how can something like this be trustworthy enough to send them my money/coins/passports. If you want to make a business then act like a business and not like a teenager in his mom's garage. And don't collect people's passport scans.
Anyway, my question still stands. Do you know any exchange which would allow me to withdraw fiat without endangering my identity?

I was going to use it but then I read about fastestcoins scams and started considering alternatives.
