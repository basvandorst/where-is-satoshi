You need some clear proof the coins were stolen and you didnt simply sell/trade them.
Unfortunately it doesnt matter that you have the keys of the original address the 11 coins were stolen from, that doesnt show anything
Sorry to say

Another network can overtake bitcoin if you get global players on board to use it.
Bitcoin happened organically and satoshi has long since disappeared.
Doubtful another network can overtake this because of trust.
What other project do you see countries like russia, china and the us showing even a remote interest in adopting?

Moving more money in the banking system requires much more infrastructure to verify everything.
Need manpower to confirm and verify to not fuck things up.
Bitcoins Revolutionized this but before bitcoin, it would cost a good deal of money to verify if the issuer indeed had the correct funds.

This is all wishful thinking.
Greater majority of people cannot be bothered with storing their own crypto.
Banks will always exist, sad to say.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:30:07
Its nothing new only now there is an actual clear pathway for this to happen
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:29:27
Especially with the trillions they have invested in the USD

Gold and bitcoin do not have much in common, at the current moment. I think this is a huge fallacy, in believing that gold is a “store of value”. It hasnt really been for well over 100 years and its insanely speculative at best.

Haha. No fucking way itll be that low

It would still be valuable regardless as the current systems in place are inefficient to sustain an internet based economy

It’s actually more possible than you could imagine.
Not being a doom prepper but the amount of derivatives out there are being kept at bay because of low interest rates is worrying.
10+ years of low interest rates is insanely damning because it’s leading to increased inflation. 
At some point, it’ll reach a saturation point where it can’t be undone and hiking up the interest rates will cause a chain reaction of defaults.
It’s not just the US central bank practicing this shit...it’s EVERY central bank in the world.

Doubtful that finney or the other szabo are.
I don’t understand you idiots that blindly think finney or szabo are.
They’ve both published papers BEFORE bitcoin under their names yet decide to publish bitcoin under a pseudonym?
You dumb shits refuse to understand that bitcoin wasn’t guaranteed to become what it is today. 
Why the fuck would they decide to publish under a false name then?
Stupid fucks

Ironic, in early 2017 I read bitcoin was being used by criminals and it’s very reason that got me interested.
I was wondering, “wtf, why are the most wanted people by police and govt using this thing as a form of payment?”
Read up on bitcoin, finally understood how it worked and was blown away. Threw all of my money into this thing when it was $750 and haven’t looked back.
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:12:01
I’m a dumb ass:
Does this mean that they’re getting rid of BAT rewards (that never happened) and switching this to a bitcoin payout?

Your idea of equating bitcoin to debt isn’t making any sense.
A few of those other analogies aren’t making sense either

Bitcoin will provide a solid foundation to account for value but if it reaches 100% saturation, it will not be the financial liberator we all hope for.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:22:14
Chad bitcoin cares about the price and isn’t all in on bitcoin but rather every shit coin.
This meme is a certified fail
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:17:57
Don’t be one of those jerk offs who dont know shit about the technology and only talks about “crypto” prices.
To be honest, you deserve to have people shit on you then.
Know a lot of people who fell into that boat and greater majority don’t follow crypto anymore.
I’ve had people mock me during the price dip but they were surprised I kept buying regardless of price. 
There are a good number of folks who fall into this category and they all think the same
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:29:47
They still talking about China banning bitcoin?
Lol and still today?

What makes you think finney was?
Why would he suddenly decide to use a pen name? Did he have a habit of releasing his papers under a pen name?
Why would he suddenly break form and release bitcoin under a pen name?
Hal was an honorable guy and denied being satoshi till his last days. Why in the world would a dying man deny this?
I get that the community wants satoshi to be Hal but the logic doesn’t add up.

You people are delusional.
Finney has no precedence of using a pen name and suddenly uses one? What about his other projects?
Why didn’t he use a pen name for those projects?
The logic doesn’t add up.
Yes bitcoins market cap is $89billion but how the fuck was he supposed to know this during the time bitcoin was published? 
No one knew.
Also, it’s not as if bitcoin was running perfectly when it was released...it wasn’t.
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:05:01
Lol you dumb cuck.
How the fuck is he trying to manipulate buyers? You act like he’s a fucking snake oil salesman. what exactly is he selling to “manipulate” buyers? He’s sharing some pretty fucking solid research surrounding market psychology.
Has his price prediction been spot on? No.
Has his firms research been spot on? Yes.
Is the research he’s sharing educating people? Yes.
Last time I checked, he’s a respected analyst and partner at a fund who threw his hat into the ring when not many have the balls to put their reputations on the line for bitcoin. Give the man some fucking credit.
Better than the horse shit your dumb ass is contributing to the space.
Go back to sucking your thumb and shoving your foot up your ass you dumb fuck.

If the economy collapses. People will question what is value.
What has value is determined by the economy in place. 
If you collapse our current economy, food, and shelter will become the most valuable things. Next to that, guns, weapons and tools.
Any idiot who thinks bitcoin or gold will have “value” is just kidding themselves.

I’ve thought about your position:
One additional comment, if the price of bitcoin drastically increases in terms of fiat, two things are happening: 1- bitcoin is being purchased directly with fiat. 2- bitcoin is being purchased directly with shitcoins.
If you pay attention, I’m sure you have, to the shitcoin/bitcoin ratio it tells the story of how they are all slowly dying. They never seem to capture and exceed their all time highs.
Most dumb asses who follow the shitcoin/fiat prices for the most part don’t seem to understand the attrition to bitcoin that is happening.
Once bitcoin prices reach a substantial fiat value, the shitcoin/bitcoin ratio will be completely decimated and to your point...dead. Edit: funny how shitcoin pumpers seem to remember the “all time highs” of their shitcoins when bitcoin was at around $20,000 but cant seem to recall that the shitcoin/bitcoin ratios were hitting near all time lows.
Their are some interesting projects with decent hash/network security/user base (solid fundamentals) but of course, time will tell.

There’s a reason why this country is turning to shit and it’s because of the cut &amp; paste logic people like you have.

You mean to tell me the US has suddenly figured it out?
You really are dumber than shit
