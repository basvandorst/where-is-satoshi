Dude I jsut sent them 0.3 btc like an hour ago and then I notice no funds so I email them no response and then I see this on there main site.This is fucked I had major ETC holdings with them along with this BTC I just sent in.

So because I dont spend all my time day and night posting and gaining karma Im not allowed to speak my opinions or questions on reddit?

Most file sharing services pay active uploaders already based on amount of downloads but using btc will make things way easier.

One thing I do is run Jaxx wallet on old iphone when Im done using my wallet I turn off wifi and turn off phone.Works great and recycling old phone.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:03:08
This was discussed on twitter yesterday synapsepay protected there customer account from the thieves at Bitfinex.They get props for going the extra mile to save your money.Which I would have used them.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:50:26
The BTC going back to my wallet like I always do.ETC ETH going to poloniex for further trading.But yeah other then trading capital all profits go straight to my Jaxx wallet Ive always done this.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:43:32
Must be one of them bitfinex paid trolls keep up the good work.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:52:58
Never Again and  I will continue to bash them till they cease operations.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:56:44
Try Jaxx wallet if you want other options works great and simple to use.

Bitfinex-We're in the Token Stealing business Stupid............
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:57:21
So instead of shutting there shit down they stayed open and kept taking ppls deposits like me and now my money is being socialized why?Were starting bounty on all heads involved including zack maximum destruction maximum damaged.Gonna be a fun ride boys buckle up.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:41:18
Nothing worse then board/angry hackers bitfinex ceo can run but he can't hide when he has a bounty on his head.Who is up for starting a btc bounty on all involved in bitfinex operations?Including bitch ass zack? We turn there world upside down hack everything associated to them.Even there family's will be affected women and children included.ill put up one btc to get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:00:54
Welcome to Bitfinex 
They did the same to me.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:34:27
That is really cool art Ive always been into street art.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:22:07
Trust me if the FBI is really involved it's not to help bitfinex its to gather evidence to prosecute them.Dont drop the soap guys.

Good think I'm a grown man with tons of medical marijuana money to burn.And in this situation I'm just standing up to the bully.Either way much entertainment value.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:29:44
My goal from this day on is too do everything in my power to destroy whatever is left of this scumbag exchange.Cannons will be firing on every social media front day after day.my 0.3btc deposit that I sent hours after the hack is now going to be a social loss why because bitfinex knew they where hacked but kept taking deposits knowing that all funds being sent where going to be stolen by them anyway.Its cool were gonna teach them a good lesson and we will sink whatever coin they release.You don't steal from btc ppl we never forgive and never forget.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:11:06
I know I logged in very depressing seeing half my ETC gone.I just want to move whats left to poloniex and forget this nightmare shit box exchange.To add insult to injury that useless token is now displayed front and center to remind of every time I log in how I was ripped off.

@_date: 2016-08-08 23:14:08
I would say the same for you anyone protecting bitfinex after they robbed hundreds of people sends a flag that your working for them.How much is bitfinex paying you to attack people sharing there story's of loss? I love how you keep attacking anyone that speaks out against there bail in.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:22:40
Very Sad my Butt Still Hurts
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:15:08
More and more truth is coming to light Bitfinex is done anyone stupid enough to keep trading will encounter further losses based on there never ending problems.Seems to me these guys set up bitfinex to rob everyone from the start.I dont even believe they where hacked anymore this was a master plan by a man who has been stealing from people for long time.Theres a reason there whole crew is hiding account being deleted.
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:56:50
Oh man this gets better and better
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:05:18
You buy btc when its low and you sell when its high.You do need some money to start or you could mine some alt coins and convert to btc.There is still plenty of money to be made buy some now I did and I will sell when it goes up so far Im up 90 usd per a coin since the bitfinex hack crashed the price.Thats how you make money.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:15:03
They should be hiding allot of people looking for them.You can run bitches but you cant hide.LOLZ

@_date: 2016-08-08 04:07:43
Can you help me get my btc back I sent to bitfinex who stole it from me? That would be really great.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:26:17
The BTC I sent is still in there address so my deposit is ok.Just check your address on blockchain.info and see if you balance is still there or if it says 0.
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:32:39
Looks like its being washed if you ask me.

Why would anyone want that connected to bitcoin?Has no one learned anything?wtf
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:10:07
Instead of tweeting bs they should be working on figuring out how to run an exchange that doesnt crash every other day and destroy btc price in the process.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:32:36
It's not the first or gonna be the last time they suck and that's how they rape us all using it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 19:20:16
WTF is going on here did I fall into a coma and have bitcoin taken over by eth devs?This is so stupid why would the devs ruin bitcoin like this?

DOnt like bread I used it for a couple weeks but it really sucks.Nonstop re syncing after which 50% of the time the transactions is still missing and you must do it again.Also fee are auto so you cant change them.I love Mycelium for android and jaxx btc/eth wallet for ios.
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:09:23
Your first purchase has to be on a credit card after that the bitcoin option is allowed again.I had the same issue so thats how I found out.I used a prepaid cc
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:21:47
Oh Jaxx is also for windows very simple no syncing nonsense or downloading the entire blockchain from when the beginning of time.

The head Dip Shit from f2pool Chandler Dingdong was running his mouth about using pools hashpower to attack ETH Classic.Then dummy figured out how much money he would lose and shut his retard face.Lost allot of mining power on his shitty pools as a consequence. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:39:23
CoinBase is on its last leg larger costs then profits had to go overseas to sweep up any lose change they could get to keep the lights on for a few more months.Last place in the world I would be storing, buying, or selling any bitcoin.I use Bitfinex,poloniex,bittrex for my crypto trading needs.The funny thing about a leach is you take away its food supply it just shrivels up and dies.Hopefully coinbase does too.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:14:12
This would be amazing we could start having a real democratic system instead of the corrupt circus we have now in America.Where the best America has to offer is a spoiled baby billionaire and a dumb fake bitch.You chose who is who.

There is a service called bitpay that most stores use it gives you options on what u can do with the btc.You can either keep it in btc or you can have them convert to fiat on the fly and post payment to your bank account.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:11:43

The syncing is a problem for me nonstop and sometimes I have to sync many time to show transaction I know is already on the chain.Then theres the part where they choose not to show anything in btc but mbtc or whatever not a fan of that either really sucks when you want to send in btc format.
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:49:16
The mem pool was filling up earlier now I know why.Allot of miners down right now because of the heat wave around the globe.I had to underclock just to keep things going but if it gets worse I'm shutting down too.
