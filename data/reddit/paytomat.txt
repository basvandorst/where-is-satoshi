Adoption is a slow journey but a confident one.
Soon enough, every business will accept bitcoin or some kind of cryptocurrency, cant wait for these times.

Hot wheel rich in May, lambo rich in December

I'm not one for conspiracy generally, but this is a bit intriguing. Aside from the 6th of every month, its just your average tightening pattern, but it being on the 6th doesn't seem very coincidental, seems very planned and strategized. 
The big boys in the space may know that this information is getting around, and they may be concerned that their longs will be squeezed out around June 6th. 
If i was a trader, I would consider playing out a short position in case of a bearish scenario, obviously risky but it seems best to play against the herd at times like this.

Some solid TA here for sure, nevertheless, patience WILL win this race. Just play it smart.

I think everyone is lacking perspective. Of course everyone that got in during December is regretting their decisions right about now and wanting to call it quits, but they didn't experience the run up in the months prior to December.
Fundementals have strengthened alot since this time, a 2 year bear market just wouldnt be warranted considering all of the good news and adoption coming out of many places. Nasdaq with their trading desk opening up eventually, ETFs will come eventually bringing alot of institutional money with it.
No reason to be truly bearish IMO, may take some long term patience but nothing is going to 0, just remember that.

Patience always wins the race, fear drives the market but so does greed. Stay greedy.
