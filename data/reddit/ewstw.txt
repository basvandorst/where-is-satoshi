Yeah, I did a small transfer this morning. Took a total of 10 minutes.

Do people really talk about Cryptocurrency this much in real life? I never hear about it outside the internet

I'm not really into the whole crypto currency thing, but that's a stupid fucking argument to make.

Instead of pointing at other inventions that have nothing to do with Bitcoin, maybe we'd be better served by addressing the critics

For every breakthrough, there's 100s of "good ideas" that never caught on.

So, I'm as noob as you can get. I've heard of bitcoin but never looked into it at all, but after reading something about bitcoin mining, I thought I'd look into it a bit.
I have a fairly decent computer, it won't be making it to the top page of but, it's better than most. 
Would bitcoin mining be worth getting into, I figure my computer is already on all day, might as well put it to work, right? I'm not looking to make millions, maybe not even thousands, just some extra investment. 
Is this a pipe dream and I won't be able to mine shit without a super rig, or would it be worth looking into? Not looking for any information other than an obvious bias "Yeah, it might be slightly profitable"

I never thought it was a scam, but I never thought it would end up being a good investment. 
Really should have invested back in college.....
