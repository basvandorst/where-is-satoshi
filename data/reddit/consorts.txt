Andreas, like it or not you are notable with your well informed well organized communication skills.  You may know people ten times smarter and more deeply involved than you, but they'd appear as stuttering nerds in front of a room full of fortune 500 board members.  Business leaders and Politicians may need a reliable place to google for information on you and help confirm in their minds you are relevant, as most of them or their support staff still naively trust wiki's despite the potential for vandalism.
I would keep it up - just be vigilant about it's pollution.

it's well known that paper/coin money is filthy, but that's hardly a reason to use bitcoin over a check, credit card, rfid stick, paypal etc.  some would even argue that public PC keyboards used at libraries or net cafe's to move your bitcoin around are even filthier than physical currency.

bitcoin type payees would ordinarily be stealing your music for free anyway, so consider any bitcoin you get out of them as "found money" not a replacement for other legitimate forms of payment you already accept.  keeping your bitcoin prices below your normal currency prices will further encourage fringe consumers to pay you something meaningful, as it's better than nothing at all from them.  you won't lose normal forms of payment business to bitcoin payees since the entry into the bitcoin currency marketplace is steep for any individual only wishing to buy a few songs for his playlist.

if you've ever traded in penny stocks,  
*with international adr instruments*  
bitcoin just has more decimal points.

anyone else think this is a BAD idea.
the safety of meetup comes from the identity and accountability of paid meetup leaders - these are the people i do NOT want to be anonymous.

why close it all - out of protest? - just don't use it at all.
i have 2 paypal accounts and neither cost me anything to lay dormant with a zero balance.

when rich people attempt to flee a country with that kind of money - it's usually a symptom of further instability to come.  the World threat from Iran just got a whole lot more real...  just imagine what "arab spring" will be like in Iran - yes, it can and will happen.
