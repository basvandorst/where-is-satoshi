It may actually be worse than just capital controls, as you may be accused of a host of very serious offenses (foreign currency smuggling, money laundering, tax evasion etc). A dentist in Egypt was thrown in jail for selling btc in person via localbitcoins and I think there was a similar story in Pakistan. I bet Indian secret police is reading this right now to attempt to locate anyone who might have this kind of ideas and the internet makes it easy for them.

Western Union is very expensive and has one of the worst exchange rates here. You end up loosing 15%, even Paypal is cheaper in comparison.

Some solutions I have found: 
OKpay have a debit card that works with BTC. Problem: it is one of the most expensive debit cards around, costs a hefty €50 just to get it. OKpay also seems to have a bad reputation.
Webmoney: seems to be BTC friendly. Problem: many of its pages are in Russian only and they seem to only be interested in serving that area.
The false solution remains Neteller, which I previously thought worked with BTC. But actually no you can't use BTC funds loaded there with there Master Card. A work around might be to use that money to gamble/bet and then withdrawing it again so it can be usable with the debit card.

I am afraid not. Too risky. Even regular mail doesn't arrive on time here

Thanks I just found it through research too. Don't know if they'll accept my address verification (bank account statement)

This is a VISA change not XAPO. VISA global stopped issuing for non-EU residents due to its licensing/exclusivity agreements in the various Banana republics where it operates. I doubt there will ever be a VISA equivalent unless VISA/Paypal renegotiates its agreements with those countries.

Well, they do and they make even more money this way. Nothing better for fat margins than exclusivity deals. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:09:52
Nope, XAPO (as many others) was already not operating in the US. This is essentially VISA enforcing its licensing agreements in individual countries, where it basically offers an exclusivity to local banks to issue VISA cards.

I just don't understand why set it this way, I am OK with paying higher just like on other wallets, have no idea why they opt to do this
@_date: 2016-10-20 22:09:07
This is just...I already contacted them, said they are "working on it"

That's weird my experience with Purse is still limited but I never taken orders with multiple items, they just sound off, and I strictly stick to Prime 2 day shipping, as waiting 10 days for an order to ship and escrow release defeats the purpose of Purse for me.

Advcash Xapo Moneypolo, but they all charge a fee somehow but no inactivity fee or minimum balance

Well thanks for the list. I followed the "official" guide stated here and tried two different "officially-recommanded" exchangers just to run into a wall for something I feel should really be as brainless as purchasing an ebook on Amazon
I didn't expect to face these restrictions (country restrictions, phone verification ugh why? We are not asked that for any other internet purcahse)

Seen it not good. On top of the safety concern it is prone to scam and I don't want to participate in money laundering for the local drug dealers
