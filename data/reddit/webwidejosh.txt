Exactly. I put spending money in my wallet, and my web wallet, or mobile device wallet.
It's money that I put at risk for convenience of spending. I can lose it or have it forcefully taken. Risk vs. reward consideration; that's how it works. ;)

Think about it like this, such as you having a joint account with someone.
You have a debit card in your wallet, this other person also has a debit card. It is for the same account and allows the same access, but it is not money.
The debit card just allows access to the accounts, and your wallet can contain many debit cards, even debit cards the other wallet doesn't have.

I do not know anything about change addresses, I do not understand how they work.
I know this.
If I generate a private/public pair on a computer that has *NEVER* been connected to a network I can trust as best I can if *no one* *ever* sees the private key.
When I import that private key and spend/send bitcoins (on another connected sytem), I can never trust it again. I then send the rest associated with the private key to another address of pair (as above) that is trusted, secured, and safe.

What I'm attempting to convey is that allowing you limited cash to travel with does not keep you from spending anonymously, avoiding taxes, or funding illicit activities. It only limits it.
Allowing you to withdraw cash, despite having a paper trail again, only limits it as well. They know you have the money, they don't necessary know how you spend it. If I can withdraw cash from my debit card, $300, $600, or $1000 per day every day... It limits it but doesn't stop it and it does nothing to prevent (other than limit) A and B that you mention. What good does a paper trail of you having it help if there is nothing showing how you spent it? Should you be allowed to withdraw or take more money if you bring receipts back? ;)

If you have the private key you go to help &gt; debug &gt; console and importprivkey &lt;private key&gt;
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:07:39
I think they are talking about paper wallets and it's like taking 500 dollars and putting them in a wallet and burying it somewhere.
You are absolutely sure that nobody saw you bury it. But to spend it you have to go and dig it up. You found it, so you know nobody stole it, even IF they knew where it was. But they could have followed you there or happened to see you dig it up, why put it in the same place?
When you spend 100 dollars and you bury the other 400 dollars in the same place there is still a chance someone knows its there. So you put the 400 somewhere else, another wallet (or at least another address). You still can't be 100% sure, maybe 99.9999999% sure nobody saw you.
Basically the act of moving from paper to electronic may allow any amount of chance of your private key being intercepted, so sending the rest to another public address in which the private key was NEVER exposed secures it once again.

It's non-destructive. You can put your private key in multiple clients, it doesn't 'move' until you create/send a transaction.

The limits have nothing to do with the travel however, and if you had your limit raised by your bank and were there enough days you are effectively skirting the limit.
You could also transfer the money to another person or make a PayPal purchase. You could meet in-person and make a "purchase" in exchange for local currency, very similarly to how you did the BTC exchange. You have your PayPal account credentials in your brain.

I think this is a very interesting point, because you can travel with your ATM card/PIN and have thousands in your accounts. You can also have money in PayPal and various other cash-equivalent accounts. However... You can also travel with a copy of the block chain. What does that mean? ;)
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:10:52
Remember, a wallet is a list of 1 or more private keys. It does NOT hold any particular value, just access to the combined value assigned to all those addresses in the network.
The private keys allow you to spend coins associated with an address, the actual address is derived from the private key.
If you use your private key to spend an amount, you (or nobody) will ever be able to spend those coins already spent.
Unlike fiat money however you can make a backup of those private keys, which is no less than awesome. But you are not backing up the value, just the access to the value currently assigned to those addresses in the network.

This may be the reason for the rules, but not the real action of what they act to prevent.

Are you sure? Every time I log into Amazon it informs me of price changes in my cart. I think Amazon is one of the major retailers that could handle such large price fluctuations. They already have the logistical controls in place to change prices in a rapid and sweeping manner. Although I'm sure they have quite the discount on credit card fees, the minimization of fees to transact in BTC may be enough to assist with their own logistical controls to mitigate price fluctuation concerns.

At just 1% payment how long do you think this "flock" will take? Surely there will be some time to prove it even works before people adopt it. Then people will have to bother the change to their mining client for the 1%. I would suggest trying a 3-5% increase to cause people to adopt the new pool even quicker. How much faster will the adoption to 51% take in your projections?
Do you think that other pool operators may also follow suit? If you are doing it for 1% for some reason, maybe someone else will try 2% or 3% also. Who is going to win this fight? You may also have to fight institutional miners. Have you taken that into account?

Only slightly more secure. The logger would have to be operating on only the compromised account, which is unlikely.
The chance is greater that if you or another user allows your machine to be compromised it will soon be compromised for all accounts or at the very least compromised to a point in which the logger or such is running at a increased security level in which *all keystrokes* are compromised.
It isn't worth it. For a high value of BTC, protect it by booting to an isolated partition, USB key, or LiveCD that has not been connected to the network.

Let's say you were going to sell something. Would you only take cash or would you take BTC as well? If you are willing to take both wouldn't you offer both a USD price and BTC price, or at least offer a 3rd party's (exchange) rate of conversion?
The restaurant gets to do that as the time of advertisement OR sale. Even if they only advertise or guarantee a single currency, they also get to decide the "alternative currency" rate as the point of sale machine, or on the check. As long as they still accept their initial advertised price of the meal, in that currency it is fair as the consumer gets to decide to accept the original or the alternative.

It's wrong and right at the same time. You owned up to it, so points for that, but its still like taking money from someone's hand.
Just because you're better than the next thief doesn't mean you're not a thief. How would you feel if someone took a $20 from your hand telling you that you shouldn't have it out in the open because it will be stolen. You may be right, but its not your right to do so.

Your second point is very true. However there are some other new ideas that would compliment that. Some restaurants already have electronic ordering at the table online, and some even offer kiosks at the table to do so. Very easy for dynamic pricing to be in effect.
Also, as the check is likely to have both dollars and a bitcoin amount on it at the point of generation it would be entirely up to the patron at the time of paying to decide which they prefer.

True, but the risk vs. reward isn't there. Very cheap to use a bank to beat the risk. With a simple private key and advanced cryptography the security required becomes very inexpensive, unlike securing physical coins, dollars, etc under your mattress.
You can also not have multiple copies of dollars, so fire or other destruction is an immediate concern. The remedy of securing a key with advanced cryptography in multiple places is certainly possible however.

Instead of some "gestapo" like VISA or MasterCard, individual businesses can decide on a 3rd party to provide to their customers. If the customers like these competing 3rd party "escrow" companies policy on consumer complaints and charge-backs they can then trust them to decide fairly.
If either the consumer base or businesses can agree on a competing market of transaction processors we have a free-market, and a new/expanded industry. Instead of having 2, 3, or 4 major credit cards there is infinite room for competition.
Credit card charge-backs work because your bank and the credit card company is in the middle and you trust them, or not. Basically new companies will be inserted in here with their own fee system. It's like re-booting the electronic transaction market.

Decide your risk. If you build a complete bomb shelter 300 feet in the earth and install redundant offline computers to generate private keys, you may be going to far.
If you buy a cheap laptop that is never connected to the Internet and generate private keys, you are probably just paranoid enough.

PayPal has funds in US banks and apply various policies to continually assure they are not allowing illegal transactions. If they physically had the dollars in their possession (in a building, not a bank), and were not applying any policies to assure compliance with laws... The government would certainly take every single one of those dollars during seizure. Even if they had them in an account at a bank they would freeze the account.

No, it only affects your copy and access of the blockchain. Your funds are secured by the private key which you can export from the application, or moving/securing your wallet elsewhere.

I would consult and attorney or legal documentation. I believe it should, but probably will not, be handled like seizure of any other goods or money pending investigation.
If you had valuables in a company that was seized pending investigation, how would you get them back? If you had money tied up in a company that was shut down because they (not necessarily you) were doing something illegal, how would you recover your losses?
Something like this *has* happened before, but not particular in the exact same way.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:16:43
Certainly did, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:39:16
Certainly. There are insurance policies for all sorts of irreplaceable principal.
It can be insured at multiple rates... You could be paid back your original investment if the coins are lost, the value at time of loss, or even full replacement value to name a few.
You  just need someone willing to trust the security procedures enough to underwrite it. Customers would then simply have to trust the underwriter.

I heard a rumor that Bank of America has already partnered with Robocoin, but haven't found a reference. That makes me inclined not to believe it.
However, I think there will be a smaller 3rd party payment provider such as Square to kick it off. Then it will be a race by major banks to include it in their own POS systems.

I believe, but am not sure, that some wallets may send coins "from" an address that isn't best to receive back to. I believe I read some warning in Electrum about this.
If you were buying something for $1.50 in a vending machine, perhaps .0017 BTC and the decimal was misplaced, or autocorrected to .17 or 1.7 it is suddenly a large amount that it may not be best to handle automatically at the machine. That may require more security, which can be facilitated with signed transactions.

I can't answer your question, but please keep asking it! Call your POS provider and harass them to accept bitcoin on their POS.
A restaurant is a perfect place to deliver a barcode on a printed receipt in which the POS generates and monitors for payment on the network.
Restaurants already trust you to deliver payment. You can easily just get up and walk out leaving the check on the table. You could leave a few bucks on top of the ticket that shows you owe $47 for the meal. This is a perfect place to have a barcode for a patron to scan and pay to. The POS can simply assign a new barcode for each ticket and assign payment to that table check when it arrives.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:20:51
Yes, they actually have the choice to include transactions or not. This is why transaction fees are important, although not necessary (at this point). If you do not include a transaction fee they will probably include it, someone probably will for the good of the network. However if you include a larger transaction fee you are promoting profit for mining above the diminishing award that is already there.

@_date: 2013-11-15 20:13:02
Yes. Even better if the private key is kept extremely secure. How about that for one-way banking? You could put a securely printed private key in a safe deposit box or encrypted drive and use the public address over and over and over.

You may be transferring your wealth from USD to BTC, but someone else is transferring from BTC to USD. It's transferring, but zero-sum.
Mostly, because BTC is mined but its mined for work, and how much work? What you get out of the results. Are you going to spend $5,000,000 on a 60 GH/s ASIC? Not now. Will you spend $5? Yes, but how many can be sold at $5? It's economics and lovely how it works it self out.

Would you buy a tenth of a share of stock? How do you know if it is too late to buy a stock, commodity, or other currency?
Nobody can know the answer to your question, but you are important in knowing you do not need a whole coin. It just doesn't matter, it can be useful in a minute fraction.

No, the wallet is free. You can transfer in BTC to store or exchange or purchase BTC within the site's functionality. There may be minimal fees to transfer out, but not generally.

Seems dubious to me as well. Would you do the same for gift cards?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:34:25
Or maybe they keep the same fees and simply add one more payment method. Allowing the Bitcoin paying community to be very content, while offering an additional stream of payments for their customers at a payment cost they are already okay with. This turnkey solution is just waiting to be tapped!

It's a great question, really. Unfortunately I feel that there are people trying to buy these physical coins. I understand how much a picture helps an article, but I feel it may lead people to purchase physical "bitcoins". Even the word "coin" in the name leads to some of the confusion. Even if a person was to acquire a physical coin, it is possible it can be tampered with or counterfeit. Bitcoin doesn't deserve this fraud, because of inherent cryptographic assurances.
I really hope we can share some good ideas here. I would suggest one at least being sure to explain that the coins are not physical, and take a few words to warn those who are new that there are limited [trusted] physical forms. A bitbill is one, and so is a Casascius coin. Explain the difference and relationship between an address and a key, perhaps showing a *sample* QR code and how it relates to the two of them.
Anything but an unexplained picture of something that doesn't exist. Even the two I mentioned are just after-market mediums for a printed key to be hidden and attached to.

Berkshire Hathaway, Inc's class A stock is trading for $173,320/share.
That doesn't mean you can't buy $1,000 worth, or that even $5 is a good or bad investment.
The key point here is that the transaction fee to sell your BTC later may be 0.0005 BTC or even 0.0000 BTC, although you'll have to pay a broker a fee to sell your BRK.A stock.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:31:45
At specific points in time, yes. But generally from my understanding smokers consume them. You'll find that purchasing bitcoins (or more securities or currencies) for investment or use will most likely be a better investment than anything that is merely consumed.

No, if I were standing in line to make a purchase and dropped a bill of currency you do not have the right to pick it up and keep it.
In fact, try that next time you are in line and you see someone drop a bill, run up and take it and put it in your pocket. Good luck.

The brain wallet is generally a function or key to encrypt or obfuscate a private key. You can transfer a private key into a program such as Bitcoin-QT or Electrum.
Not sure what you mean by regular wallet. A very common wallet is in a program called Bitcoin-qt, or the like.
Getting BTC "out" is done by sending it to another bitcoin address, such as one you generate in your software, or one provided on a website where you have a "wallet".

How many businesses have you checked up on? I bet this is common practice, especially for new businesses.
They seem *to me* to be a legit business that processes deposits and withdrawals in a timely manner. I sent money there and it makes it into my account *every time*, so I think they are what they seem. Let me know when there is actual news here.
Let me know what you find out about the other exchanges, I'm quite interested!
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:13:38
1. Yes, always use a method in which there is absolutely no way of charge-back. To my knowledge a charge-back may occur if the withdraw account can be shown to be compromised. Consider how you can prove/know the money is sent from the account owner!
2. Sure, give it a shot. You will be competing with the would on this arbitration. If you believe you have a leg up on anyone, you don't. The value in which you make will likely be what it is "worth" to do the work necessary and the risk of the price going down during your re-purchase or that the funds will be charged-back due to a compromised buyer's account.

The rule is you do what feels comfortable to you. If what you feel comfortable with matches what the other party feels comfortable with you have a transaction.
It's no different than exchanging goods for cash in a store, or selling your laptop on Craigslist or buying a ladder from a guy that was listed in the local classifieds.
If you hear scary stories it is because they are anomalies. The chance of them is probably similar to someone beating you senseless on the street for no reason or mugging you.
It's really not that dangerous to do these transactions. If you're not comfortable with it, just don't do it. Buy Bitcoins for $5 at a time through the mail to minimize your losses.
Oh, and risk-free is a misnomer.

I've accepted way more cash for a vehicle sale than I ever have for bitcoins. If someone was going to rob me... It'd be for that money and I'd still give it to them if they threatened my life.
That being said, a bank is an excellent way to complete that transaction because I simply get a cashier's check withdrawn from the buyer's account, or my own account if I'm buying. I know its legit and not cash and I can simply deposit it into my account at my own financial institution. If the buyer has cash I simply have them issue it to the cashier at my institution for a deposit into my account.
The bank will almost always complete the title/notary work for free if an account holder is involved. Super-easy, so I agree... The bank is an excellent place for a financial transaction including a 3rd party, and almost always unnecessary.
