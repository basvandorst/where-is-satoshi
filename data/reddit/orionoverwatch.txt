I invested in them, I knew it was coming but I didn't expect it to be two weeks before the halvening... I didn't ROI, however I got pretty close. Luckily the price per Bitcoin has gone up by like 250$ since I invested in them so the losses aren't as big, but still no ROI.
According to my calculations, those guys got away with close to 50M$ in Bitcoins. Pretty impressive!

True. This does mean that the increase in Bitcoin's value after the halvening (due to the supply being cut in half) will be significantly less impactful.

Price is going up again, and rapidly. The opportunity is over! Glad I got to buy some for very very cheap. Already paying off!
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:55:09
Yep, there goes all my money. Rip!
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:42:08
Yes, the fact that it went up in advance means it won't go up as much after the halvening.

Schrodinger's cat is a scientific thought experiment involving the uncertainty principle. Long story short, he's saying you should both buy and not buy Bitcoin which makes no sense!

I calculated how much money they ran away with.
They pay around 1900 bitcoins every single day during the last couple of days and they received about 2200 a day, except from yesterday which is probably why they shut down. Looking at the different dates and making a rough estimation it's pretty easy to find out they earned on average about 140 bitcoins a day during roughly 20 months which would be a cool 50M$. (it's probably around 35M$ and 65M$)
They will probably sell a small number of the bitcoins every day which will obviously make the price per Bitcoin decrease significantly during the next days, months or even years.
Kind of a pessimistic opinion but a realistic one.

There's nothing illegal about selling bitcoins for money, don't worry about that.

The price seems to be going up rapidly now. Around a dollar up per minute so far.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:06:55
Almost ROI in $, not even close to ROI in BTC.

Most likely you will be fine using one of those websites that exchange Bitcoin for USD to your bank account or via PayPal. You might have to pay taxes for it though, I'm not sure how it works in Florida.

643.19 and climbing! This amazing!
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:36:41
Usually when the price increases this rapidly, it's going to keep on increasing for a while. It probably won't end anywhere near 630 at the current rate.

Yes, the market cap of Bitcoin would be so extremely high, all economy would be based around it. With a market cap of 16.5 Trillion USD it would become a very significant currency. In fact, I'm pretty sure there isn't a single currency which has this amount of instantly usable money.

I didn't use their public information, I just looked at how much money was transferred from their wallets every day. They have wallets for receiving, sending and kind of third one where all of their money is now.

I don't see what's wrong with it, seems like a solid investment to me considering he/she bought at only 570! The price will almost certainly increase due to the halvening.
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:02:00
Does this have anything to do with the halvening? Why would the value of a bitcoin go up before the halvening? It's happening in around a month from now, this makes no sense to me. Can anyone explain?
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:34:05
It's almost impossible to tell. I would say maybe 1 in 1000 Bitcoins that have ever been mined are forever lost due to lost wallet's etc. especially from the early days. This is a good thing I believe. As Bitcoins become harder to mine, eventually the number of Bitcoins in circulation might go down because of this (a.k.a. price increase).

So terrible at math I have a master in physics. I don't know that much about Bitcoin so sorry for the bad approximation I guess!
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:04:08
I would suggest them to NOT sell all their bitcoins but instead sell a part. The halvening is happening soon and in theory, the price should go up significantly because of it.
