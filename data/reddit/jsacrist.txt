Do you mind elaborating about this third "Z" address?

I just googled "p2p bitcoin exchange" and a few results came:
* bitcoinx.org
* Dark Exchange
Has anyone here tried them? do you recommend them? I'm curious to know what the traders in that network have to say about it.
P2P exchange makes a lot of sense for p2p currency

Guitar player here: I know this is the standard tuning, I wasn't asking what the letters meant, I was asking what was wrong with it, I never knew there were people who didn't *like* the standard tuning.
