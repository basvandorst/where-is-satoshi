The way things are looking (difficulty-wise), you'll probably be investing at least $10k+ on equipment. Plus another week or two of time optimizing your setup configuration. I'd say your return on your investment will come back in about 4-8 months depending on whether you know what you're doing or not. Like millsdmb mentioned, that's a good place to start, but I'd check out bitcointalk under the mining section. There's a topic for beginners. Try there.

@_date: 2013-12-08 07:46:50
so damn true. where's that bitcoin auction site? we need it back!
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:09:29
Maybe they secretly know how to dump all BTC from every wallet on earth into theirs just kidding

You trolls are confused because you overlooked the part I said it's been a long time since I used eBay. Fees were definitely not this high in 2010 that's for sure, 10000% positive. eBay chomping $700 for a $6k sale is bullshit. What happened to the good old days when eBay fees were 2%. Damn.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:02:04
You never know what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:16:14
Yes. Hold.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:17:55
i assume it's an overload
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:53:40
Beautifully said. (*teardrop*)
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:59:47
Absolutely not. Just a reminder, that's all. Respect the hustle.
