Yeah! Fuck low fees and high transaction speed, who wants that?!

I'd suggest investing in BCH instead, it's basically what the real bitcoin whitepaper says that bitcoin is. Also the fees are super low and transactions are much faster. Litecoin is essentially the same as btc and will become slow and expensive if more people use it.

Coinbase.com, they recently enabled Bitcoin purchases (BCH - low fees, high speed)! :)

I don't think altcoin discussion is welcome here, but if you're generally interested send me a message.

Bitcoin price could also hit 1k.

I do not believe this. Must be a small sample size in one location of educated people.

Do none of you understand how scaling an infrastructure works? They've had a huge increase in traffic and users which is putting huge stress on their infrastructure. No doubt they're adding huge amounts of servers daily to help cope. Give it a little bit of time and I'm sure it'll be as smooth as it used to!

Go somewhere else then...

That's a hard choice to make. Their support has been terrible for the last couple of months. You want to keep the people happy, so you have to choose, provide support that actually gets issues resolved or you make the site stable 24/7. I've worked in similar situations and have understood how important customer support is.

Do you know what a waiting list would do???.... Drive tens ifnot hundreds of thousands of potential customers away.. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:18:04
So you think that's not what they are doing or?

I've worked in many companies that have to deal with large amounts of traffic. I know what goes on behind the scenes.
