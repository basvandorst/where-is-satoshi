LOL, I seem clueless to someone who IS clueless. You say you've been following merchant acceptance for years and try to portray merchant adoption as declining based on a few anecdotal examples. The statistical reality (which reveals you to be a clueless asshat) is that adoption is growing steadily among brick and mortar merchants as evidenced here  (hint for the clueless, click the "2013" and "today" arrows at the bottom of the map to see the progression). 


Yeah, 2 or 3 a week, out of a million transactions or so every week, almost always due to people selecting an inappropriate fee for the situation they use it. I told you if you are trying to typify in-person bitcoin transactions as "a nightmare" you'll have to do (much) better. You've failed. 


HAHAHAHA it's hilarious to watch you whip the stuffing out of that strawman! I'm sure you can ride that dead horse another mile if you beat it enough! 




The biggest problem with merchant adoption is that it's progressing to quickly. Scaling solutions are not yet ready. 


Don't project your ignorance on me. You said "Bitcoin cannot be used for *immediate payments* like Satoshi dice", to which I asked; Are you suggesting the satoshi dice site was issuing winnings, and then attempted to double spend those funds? Waiting for confirmations on deposited *bets* is fair and prudent with results automatically processing. Your failure to identify whatever it is that you think I don't understand about confirming deposits before wagers are resolved and processed is another example of your confusion about which of us is clueless. It's like, when you are dead you do not know you are dead, it's only difficult for the people around you... same thing when you are stupid. 


LOL, and yet the data at  seems to have escaped your "years of following merchant adoption", it is patently obvious that it's you who lacks basic research skills, not I. What we've been discussing here, at length, is the bullshit you routinely peddle.
I eagerly await the luls I'll get from your next post, my favourite fool.

You don't seem to understand that anecdotes are just as, or more likely, to be exceptions to the norm rather than what is typical. YOU'VE been waiting 3 months, YOU can hardly find stuff you want, YOU have to drive 45 minutes to find a merchant.. YOU'VE based YOUR beliefs on personal examples. Which of us is misrepresenting Bitcoin, the one who argues by logical fallacy or the one who spots those fallacies and presents quantitative data?

I've made many in-person transactions, never had any problem, much less a disaster. 
Local bitcoins fees are irrelevant to the question of usability in-person. Likewise private sales in person of anything carries some risk, no particular risk with bitcoins. Regarding your claim that "many sellers are breaking money transfer laws" citation is needed, not merely one example of a conviction, if you even have one. Meanwhile I can provide a great many examples of banks repeatedly admitting to violating laws.
"The issue with satoshi dice and shapefits [sic] *was*..", yes waiting a little resolved the problem.  So you stand corrected, saying "It also *cannot* be used for the things like the satoshi Dice..." is incorrect.
I for one do want the banking system replaced. If I can find one other person who feels the same way we would be "people" and you'd have to walk back another statement.

Many people have reported confusing different denominations of USD notes because they are the same colour, dose that mean USD is a "nightmare" for in-person transactions? If you are trying to typify in-person bitcoin transactions as "a nightmare" you'll have to do (much) better.  


That may have more to do with the tarnished image of Mr. Shrem than anything to do with the functionality of Bitcoin. Your example would appear to be an attempt to create the impression that merchants are abandoning bitcoin, while trends would indicate the opposite.


Another empty assertion which flies in the face of reality. {Points to bitpay, coinbase, et al.}


You said "It also cannot be used for the things like the satoshi Dice site for *immediate payouts* because people do souble [sic] spending attacks." Are you suggesting the satoshi dice site was issuing winnings, and then attempted to double spend those funds? Waiting for confirmations on deposited *bets* is fair and prudent with results automatically processing.   


Again, you are trying to portray a typical local bitcoins transaction as more hazardous than any other private sale. The vast majority of  local bitcoin encounters are issue free.

"Bitcoin cannot be used in normal day-to-day commerce "

It's not a complicated sentence. Let's try again.  For Bitcoin to be used in normal day-to-day commerce it does not need to completely replace fiat.

Again with the replacing of fiat. Light bulbs did not eliminate candles, nor were they intended to. They coexist. Cars did not eliminate horses, nor were they intended to. They coexist. 


And yet USA and Europe are where Bitcoin is most widely used. Perhaps replacing fiat is not the primary driver of Bitcoin popularity in those places, perhaps after 2008 *replacing the banking systems* is what so many people want.

The consequences and connections revealed by the Panama papers should be made and stressed. One of the biggest problems faced by Europe is the long term viability of the fiat Euro. The Euro is threatened by declining popularity of the Schengen Agreement (open border policy). The Schengen Agreement is threatened by the current refugee crisis. The refugee crisis is largely a product of the 5 year civil war in Syria. The opposition in Syria was, and is, motivated by conditions such as government failing to fund life-saving healthcare such as midwives and vaccinations for children, which in turn is a result of billions of lost tax money. Tax money which people like Assad’s billionaire cousin Rami Makhlouf evaded through offshore tax havens such as Panama. The war in Syria has dragged on so long because Bashar al-Assad has maintained some degree of loyalty and popular support, and also because of the intervention of Russian air power thanks to Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin and his close friends have participated in the Panama tax evasion schemes. 
The war in Syria might not have happened if not for the lost tax revenue revealed in the Panama papers. The Syrian war has been prolonged by intervention of Russian participants in the Panama tax shelters. The war has also been prolonged by loyalists supporting Assad, who've been unaware of the nepotism and circumvention of international sanctions that they were defending. This has produced millions of displaced people and refugees, who are a massive burden on surrounding countries. The refugees who have inundated Europe have provoked multiple border restrictions. Renewed border defence in Europe has put the Schengen Agreement into question, which weakens the unity of countries using the Euro, which weakens the Euro.

I have a very small hobby miner. Yes the bitcoins it mines are not worth the cost of electricity *today*, but that's if I sold those coins today. I'm mining for tomorrow. *Tomorrow* those coins will be harder to mine and (quite probably) be worth much more than they are today, the time/energy investment will be well worth the costs.

That Napster was a centralized entity, able to be brought to District Court is what separates it from the decentralized open source Bitcoin project. Napster was not peer-to-peer. It was not decentralized. The closure of Napster was immediately followed by the rise of the decentralized peer-to-peer BitTorrent network, which is alive and well.

I'm not sure I buy the premise here. First of all "inefficeint" is a relative position. Mining equipment has (and will continue to) become more energy efficient with each new generation. What some might call "inefficient" today is dramatically more efficient than just a few years ago. Secondly, "equally secure" would imply having equally decentralized hashing equipment and having equal hashing power. How would such a scenario come about without Bitcoin gaining the same hardware efficiencies used by the hypothetical alternative currency.. unless security can be achieved without hashing altogether.

Well, the important thing to remember here is that bitcoin is ultimately and essentially permission-less. If your parents "let" you use cash then why wait for permission to use bitcoin?

Yes, people will convert fiat into "something that is not legal", if they want to make such an exchange. That is patently obvious. I for one do not regard acquiring Bitcoins as an "investment". I want them for the utility they offer, even if the market value was never going to go up, even if it were to go down.

It's worth knowing in advance of the trip what the operator charges in fees so you don't baulk at how much bitcoins you get for your cash when you are there. For example the current average fee is 8.0%, so if you put $100 in the machine you'll only be buying ~$92.00 worth of BTC. There are some machines that charge as much as 20% and some that charge 5% or less.

Bitcoin on one node is not decentralized. That would make it fragile. To be anti fragile it requires many nodes. This is what secures the blockchain. Many nodes requires much electricity. It's a fundamental input, if you don't have lots of energy you cannot create, nor attack the blockchain. It's backed by energy, more than any attacker has been able to amass.
The ledger is immutable, for all practical purposes. The *time* required for the computer cycles needed to rewrite even a *recent* history from two days ago, using 50% of the hash power on the planet, *would take 4 days*. Meanwhile, the remaining hash power would have moved the blockchain *ahead 4 days further*. Controlling 50%+ hash power on the planet *long enough* for such an attack is not practical.  Bitcoin is backed by time.
The SHA 256 algorithm could be broken one day, the next day Bitcoin would fork to a new algo. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies use other algos anyway. The possibility that "someone fiddled" with the implementation, like the NSA, is the reason Bitcoin was made open source, so anyone could review the code. The code does what the code says. Bitcoin is backed by math.

You seem to have missed my prior point which renders your present point meaningless. 
You can't subpoena a protocol. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:59:11
Firstly, Napster was subpoenaed because of copy-write infringement, piracy, a crime. Running an exchange is not illegal. Governments could create new laws to make it illegal, but that's not going to happen in every country. Even if such laws had the support of the UN many countries defy the edicts of that body. 
Secondly, banning things does not translate in to "game over".  Prohibition of alcohol (US 1920) did not eliminate production or consumption. Forbidding the hoarding of gold (US 1933) did not destroy confidence in it as a store of value. Laws against prostitution and drugs have failed to eliminate those things, and taking down Napster didn't eliminate online piracy through file sharing. 
Shutting down exchanges has already been tried in places like China, it did not destroy confidence (except among people who thought as you do), but in reality it just shook out some weak hands.

No this is a bad idea. Decreasing difficulty to increase the number of blocks found per hour to increase tx throughput has at least two downsides. 
1: Increasing the block discovery rate to &lt; 10 min average will result in more new bitcoins produced per day. You mess with inflation rate when you speed up the printing press like that.
2: more blocks per hour would bloat the block chain size per year in precisely the same way a block size increase would have, a scaling proposal which was roundly rejected by many node operators and developers and much of the community in a highly contentious manner last year. Small blocks righteously won and we will not refight that war for a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:56:26
Some would say the bcash hard fork was just a misstep taken by some impatient and misguided parties. 
Others would say it was created merely to save face when it appeared independent nodes supporting UASF BIP 148 were going to become a majority, and ruin the advantage that covert ASIC boost conveyed to a certain maker of mining equipment. 
I for one expect side chain projects such as Rootstock will eventually endow Bitcoin with any desirable aspects of alt coins, while doing so with the unparalleled security afforded by the hash power behind the bitcoin blockchain.

Having to pay bills with fiat (assuming they lose their job in a recession) means they would have to sell the bitcoins they bought, last time I checked anyone who bought bitcoins over 2 months ago can do so without a loss. They may even have more left over to see them through the recession, maybe much more. 
Yes, the buying power of the dollar declines every year. It's called inflation. Bitcoin trends up, it's called scarcity.
"Decentralization" is the word used to describe the network topography, it's a computer science term. It also applies to governance, decisions such as inflation rate are not centrally controlled.

No that's not what I'm talking about. It's the whole jumble of assumptions and conclusions you've made.  
For example: "If another recession hits the economy, then those who are taking out loans to buy crypto currency will be hit the hardest, assuming they lose their job."
That's not an obvious outcome and you've made no effort to even connect such dots. What makes you suppose another recession won't favor holders of crypto? 
Then there's this: "The higher the price goes, the less you own, the more Bitcoin has to rise in fiat value for you to make a decent return." 
Please explain how "you own less" based on price. And "decent return"? What do you think this is? As someone who's been involved in bitcoin for years and was attracted years ago by the the computer science, the philosophy of money and the disruption of old world politics, power and privilege I think bitching about "decent returns" is.. sad.   
I think your real problem is the distribution of bitcoins; "Those who were lucky to have bought it early reap the rewards, while those who missed out, even because they were born later miss out are stuck at the bottom". Look, everyone who "bought it early" not only took a greater risk than those who bought after, they were also *paying attention* while others were not. Yes, very young and not yet born people have no such opportunity to bet time on fringe developments and risk actual money on long shot ventures, what's your solution? Should we also redistribute 4 letter domain names like beer, taxi &amp; porn.com so people not around at the dawn of the internet (like me) get a fair chance to register those? What about land in the Americas, settlers were offered 100 acres and a mule if they took a gamble and moved to the new world.

I'll admit the value of bitcoin can be affected by legal edicts if you admit that ultimately such prohibitive policies end because governments recognize that their inability to enforce such policies only diminishes their stature and authority, leading to industrial production and explosions of investment in those industries. Eg, gold, alcohol and cannabis.

Many civil liberties have been curtailed, that's true and the lack of effective protest is discouraging. However, that's not to say liberties will only be lost and never won in the future. Straws accumulate until the camels back is broken, pendulums swing in one direction until they reverse. The Occupy movement never had a widely shared and specific objective or agenda. It was a mass display of discontent over a basket of systemic issues. To some people Bitcoin is a continuation of The Occupy movement by other means, so no, I don't think  that movement was absolutely crushed by government violence, the struggle continues without tents and tear gas.

As a beginner you missed the earlier phases where there were more and more merchants every day. Then, partly because of that, Bitcoin gained so many users that the system developed the lag and fees you see today. So, while it's in a speculative phase right now, that is creating demand for more merchants. As upgrades roll out to improve capacity and reduce fees you'll see more merchants adopting again. Until then, fees on the price of a lambo are insignificant.

Bitcoin is fully backward compatible with the code released in 2009. Bcash is now a separate chain. You can send a segwit tx to any old wallet, but you cannot send bcash to, say, Hal Finney's old bitcoin wallet. His widow would need to setup a bcash wallet to receive these altcoins.

Were not talking about email or any other network. Were talking about the peer to peer bitcoin network. Do you run a node? If not why not? Spin one up and run it for a month. Then see how you feel when someone suggests increasing block sizes 10 or 20 x. 
I also suggest you consider how to establish consensus to implement a "temporary block size increase", with both hard forks needed to add and then remove the increased block size without fragmenting the user base (more than it already is). Basically your question reflects a naive appreciation for how and why things are as they are. Don't feel embarrassed, just consider my reply and keep learning and reading. Its not hard to see that others have used exactly what you are innocently suggesting as a very nasty attack vector to fragment the bitcoin community.

The problem, you say, is money leaving [insert country], because not every country has an exchange, which in the event of a downturn leaves that country with less money within its economy. The cash has not disappeared, its only changed hands. If both buys and sellers are domestic the net impact on the economy is nil.

You're the one yelling in caps, mr. REPARABILITY 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:25:04
I don't think that's true. Capital gains applies when you sell an asset and profit fiat. There is no "profit", you are not realizing gains. The additional buying power is actually merchants adjusting prices (asking less and less crypto) to reflect a changed collective *perception* of worth. The merchant will charge sales tax as usual so the government has no basis for complaint. In my country of Canada barter rules for commerce in crypto apply.     
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on this.

The entire bitcoin network could *hypothetically* run on just 2 laptops, the way it did back when Satoshi sent bitcoins to Hal Finney in the beginning. Of course more hash power than that is desirable today for the sake of security. Nonetheless, the hash rate today (and resultant difficulty) is largely superfluous and power consumption ascribed to "Bitcoin" is a primarily a reflection of the competition between miners vying to earn the next block reward. I put the blame where it belongs on the shoulders of greedy miners wanting a bigger slice of the pie, a bigger share of block rewards, trying to dominate each other with equipment. I agree the environmental foot print is large and I'd like miners to reflect on the ethics of exploiting cheap power in places like China to essentially shift environmental costs on the rest of the world.

BCH is not bitcoin at all. Bitcoin was created by Satoshi. Satoshi had wallets &amp; ran nodes. We can interact with his wallets and nodes today, if we are using bitcoin.  BCH does not interact with Satoshis wallets and nodes, just like Satoshis wallets and nodes do not interact with Ripple or Dash. BCH is THAT incompatible with Bitcoin,  the living system Satoshi created. Bitcoin is not some nebulous concept,  "block chains" or "cryptocurrency" might be nebulous but Bitcoin is a very specific implementaion and in computer science close is not good enough, it computes or it does not and to a bitcoin node BCH does not compute.

I'd say you're mistaken. Bitcoin was intended to evolve and change, the original implementation being released as version 0.1 makes that conclusion inescapable. However proposed changes require consensus as described in the white paper. 
[section 4] "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it." 
In the case of the BCH fork, BCH does not have the greatest proof of work invested in it, and never did. The BCH changes to the consensus rules lacked consensus of the majority, rendering it's blocks invalid to Bitcoin nodes. 
One interesting aspect of all this is that Satoshi and the white paper did not anticipate the emergence of ASIC chips (and the covert ASIC boost Bitmain developed which gave it an edge against the many other hardware manufacturers from earlier years) which lead to the high degree of mining centralization we see today. Bitmain has controlled a majority of hash power for some time and could win (could have won) a consensus dispute based on POW. Bitmain is also a major contributer to the creation of BCH. That raises the question of why Bitmain did not use it's influence to give BCH the consensus it needed to become "Bitcoin". I think the reason is two-fold. 1: Bitmain does not control a majority of nodes, those favor Bitcoin without the block size increase (at this time). 2: The economic majority does not favor the block size increase, hash power follows money.

Yes, a BIP9 soft fork will not activate unless 95% of the miners signal readiness.
What makes it into Core software is up to Core, your business is what you want to run.


To be accurate, miners and users want a *capacity* increase. Some have the mistaken impression that block sizes is the only way to to do that on chain. I can't imagine where such a deceitful notion might be peddled. Nonetheless, there are bullshit artists and those who they've managed to con who mistakenly say they are "not getting that from Core."

The Bitcoin Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing and patches. [This document] ( explains the practical process and guidelines for contributing.
In terms of structure, there is no particular concept of “Core developers” in the sense of privileged people. I'm not going to do your research for you but I'd bet *someone* from outside of Core has been integrated into Core over the past year, probably because they have decent ideas or code.

I *feel* you are being obtuse. What makes it into a Core release and how it gets there is irrelevant.  


Here's why your question is irrelevant: BIP 100, by Core developer Jeff Garzik, was released quite some time ago. [Some] ( miners are signalling for it. It has not ACTIVATED because it needs more support, just like BU and SW both need more support to ACHIEVE CONSENSUS. THAT's the ONLY consensus which matters. Core can produce whatever it want's, however it wants. It has no control over what gets IMPLEMENTED.

Probably because he's got better things to do than explain stuff every bitcoiner should already know. 
Whatever changes make it in to a Core release, and no matter how consensus is reached for such changes, those changes are merely presented to the community of users and miners, who then decide to implement them or not for themselves. If the Core team could "unilaterally decide for every bitcoiner" we'd all be using SegWit right now.
This notion which the BU camp routinely insinuates, that the Core dev team is some sort of imperial domineering tyrannt, is absurd.
It's a cynical, political and contrived attempt to manipulate the bitcoin community, a segment of which is prone to rebellion.

Not necessarily. Hypothetically, BU could activate with the support of a relatively few number of large pools. The pool admins could support BU due to coercion, or deceit, stupidity, greed, malice... 
If most devs feel such a direction is a dead end they could decide to continue efforts only on the old chain, assuming it still survives, leaving the BU fork to stagnate (and possibly implode under the weight of trying to exceed 30 tps through bigger blocks alone).

Securing the network is the function of miners, but they are not the only stake holders. "Voting with mining costs $$ and ASICs, so not as easily rigged" but rigged nonetheless, as today it disenfranchises 99.9% of users. The network was conceived to be egalitarian, everyone could mine on a GPU and consensus could be established with 1 computer = 1 vote. Users are rightfully suspicious of large mining pools with plans to change consensus rules to suit themselves. The only way we will ever be sure how the economic majority feel will be if a hard fork lets users choose the rules and implementation which they prefer by dumping coins on the chain they don't like. Any other "vote" is superficial.

Hashrate decides what a majority of miners want, economic majority decides what users and businesses want. A fork could put 75% of the hashrate on one chain, but a majority of users could prefer to continue conducting commerce on the minority chain. If more transactions (and thus higher fees) were found on the minority chain then for economic reasons miners would be compelled to mine the chain where the economic majority wants to transact.

I'm hoping someone can help with what seems to me a pretty complicated question about how private keys are combined to make a transaction which is larger than the individual inputs. Please correct me if I have any part of this wrong..
My understanding is that each of the 100,000,000 satoshis in 1 whole bitcoin do not have individual private keys, (unless such a single satoshi becomes the entire output of some transaction). Rather, when I receive 1.5 BCT I have 1 private key for that amount. If I spent that 1.5 BTC private key on something which only costs 0.3 BTC one of the outputs from the transaction will be 1.2 BTC (minus any fee) back to me.. (1.2 might be spent on something worth 0.8, returning 0.4 and so-on). In this way a well used wallet can accumulate many keys for various smaller sums of BTC This "dust" can be combined to make a larger transaction, however the many inputs may constitute a significant chunk of data, (which in turn may require a significant fee to the miner who processes it, (which hypothetically could cost more than the value of the dust... (unless the dust is very old but that's not what my question is about))).    
My question is this; supposing I have a wallet with 5 keys corresponding to the following amounts: 2.0 BTC, 1.5 BTC, 0.5 BTC, 0.5 BTC, &amp; 0.5 BTC. 
Now, hypothetically (assuming 0 fees for simplicity) if I spend 3.0 BTC from this wallet does the wallet (or protocol) use the 2.0+0.5+0.5 keys, or does it use the keys for 1.5+0.5+0.5+0.5, or does it use 2.0+1.5 and return 0.5 to me? What should happen by default and why? what guides such a default? # of "days destroyed"? Is the "smallest number of inputs required" the default? Inputs, how do they work?

Thank you very much for your reply, it's quite helpful! 
Is it correct to say then that some wallets would tend to gather up as many small UTXOs as practical for a given spend -essentially wadding up the dust -in the name of reducing overall load on the node network-but doing so at the expense of privacy, while other wallets would tend to use the most appropriate (smallest?) single UTXO available  in the wallet to maximize privacy?  If this is correct can you suggest wallets which typically exhibits each of those behaviours?

I'll gladly wait two weeks for difficulty re-targeting on the Core chain.

Thank you for providing an example of BU supporters incomprehension of consensus and ethics.
Consensus is premised upon consent. A hard fork is fundamentally a new system, with new rules, and is completely incompatible with the original network. Thus, by definition, a hard fork violates the user consent that serves as the basis for a consensus network like Bitcoin. Inflicting a hard fork on a system used by those who gave consent to a previous system but who do not consent to a hard fork is unethical alone. However, disrupting the remaining original chain by merge mining empty blocks on it would be a second and even worse ethical violation by denying that percentage of individuals the use of a system they contributed to with the rules they consented to. 
In contrast, a backward compatible soft fork changes nothing for any party which does not consent to the change. Miners who no longer agree with the original rules can ethically do what they want with the hash power they own, except change the rules everyone consented to to suit themselves. 
Edit: Upon further reflection I'd like to correct myself. The same people who consented to the present 1 MB block size ALSO consented to a system whereby it's potentially necessary for a hard fork by a majority of hash power. Thus, a hard fork by itself would NOT be an ethical violation of consensus. Nonetheless, denying the resistant minority use of the resultant original chain by deliberately disrupting it with merge mined empty blocks would be malicious, and certainly unethical.

If the attacker is themselves a miner, that cost is reduced by the hash power they control. If an attack cost $5m/day and the attacker has 40% of the hash power, then they collect (recover) 2m of those fees, plus rake in all the increased fees everyone else is throwing at competition for block space partially offsetting the other 3m.

That's non-sense. There are plenty of legitimate reasons. Some people will pay a premium for privacy, or the convenience of instant and on the spot acquisition of BTC. Or instant and on the spot conversion to fiat. What about the opportunity cost from the delay of signing up with an online exchange, and the delay in having your account verified (if you can even provide adequate information to satisfy KYC), which is then available to be plundered by hackers - are you so new to crypto you don't recall cavitex?  and then the 5 business days for a bank wire to clear to fund your account.. while the price is moving ~10%/day? Opportunity cost. Look it up. Convenience. Privacy.

Important advice here: 
I've been meaning to put up a PSA post here on reddit about mycelium + Quadriga for a few days, I'm sorry for not doing so because this deserves wider dissemination. 
There is a problem with the way mycelium wallet displays the CAD value of your bitcoins, I'm not clear yet if it's only when Quadriga is used as the "exchange source" but I found this when using Quadriga as exchange source in my myceium wallet.
Right now the price on Quadriga is 1 BTC = $889.97 CAD
 
My mycelium wallet (with exchange source as Quadriga) says 1 BTC = $828.78 CAD
I wrote to Quadriga support and explained the issue and received this reply: 
"yes sorry - thats a limitation of our current fx-rate backend. It takes the XBT/USD rate from quadriga and uses the fiat exchange rate for USD/CAD to get to the cad price. But for our new wallet we will have a complete different system. So, i dont think we have enough resources to change it in the meantime for the current wallet"
It's not a supper big deal to mitigate as a user so long as you spend in BTC and don't use the CAD button to calculate the BTC you are spending. With a ~$60/BTC inaccuracy you could easily over pay for something priced in CAD as the wallet will convert your CAD payment to BTC with that lower quoted value.
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:20:39

I'm running a UASF 148 node now. 


Me. My internet is not unlimited. I already do my part when the vast majority do not. You want to double my contribution or more? LOL. Not until you can convince me we need bigger blocks.
Figure out how to get us 8 times the number of people running full nodes we have now, then I'd consider your push for bigger blocks less problematic. 
 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:20:36
If the question is "how many full nodes do we really need?" the answer is: more than we currently have, because SPV clients (like what most people run), need to sync block headers with full nodes and full nodes have a limited number of sockets to service those SPV clients. So what we're going to need is *more* full nodes, not less.  
You should read: 


I don't see how they would be: The lightest setup is a pruning server with disk space requirements of about 50 GB for the Electrum database (January 2017). However note that you also need to run bitcoind and keep a copy of the full blockchain, which is roughly 125 GB (January 2017).

The market already gets to decide. We have the fee market for access to the 1mb size block. 
I think what you are advocating is letting miners decide on block size, yes?
Wouldn't that give miners even more control, in a situation where they already have enormous power over protocol changes, considering a handful of large mining pools wield advantages over smaller rivals and dominate the industry? 
I don't like your suggestion.

Sure, but if your buy at $774 had completed last week, when you initiated it, and you now had your bitcoins you'd be unhappy now, because... 


Sure coinbase is unreasonably slow to resolve this issue, but the root of your unhappiness is the market price dropped after you bought


If you had your bitcoins last week what would you have done with them? Spent them when they were worth more, or saved for the future like most of us? If you bought them for future use then you've not really lost any money until you sell below your buy price. Selling the bitcoins back at any point after last weeks peak, on the ride down, would lock in your loss. Still having the bitcoins means your gains will materialise eventually.

Firstly, not every instance of stolen credit card details results in no problems or consequences for the legitimate card holder, and certainly not for the retailers who end up with the charge backs after providing goods and services to thieves. Secondly, it's not just about credit card fraud, it's also the identity theft which comes with it and all the ways that gets abused. You have far more financial privacy with Bitcoin.

If that were true then why all the fuss about "black money"?
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:03:35
One reason (among many) is that the forkers misjudged the economics of increasing the block size. The BCH chain provides larger blocks size, which offers more capacity on-chain, which pretty much removes the fee market for BCH transactions (for now), which makes it much less attractive for miners to mine the BCH chain because there is practically no tx fees to earn on top of the block reward. So 95% of the SHA256 ASICs are pointed at the BTC chain instead, which makes BTC way more secure than BCH, which attracts users to BTC, who pay tx fees, which attracts more hash power, which makes BTC more secure, which attracts users, who pay tx fees, which attracts more hash power to BTC, which makes BTC more secure, which attracts users, who pay fees, et cetera.

Those are the ones mainly responsible for the bad image bcash has, along with the desperate efforts of some useful idiots.   
It's quite a burn to Jihan that he tried to prop up the price of BCH, only to have the gambit ruined by (what I suppose are) a bunch of r/buttcoiners and IMF agent provocateurs who use bcash as a bludgeon against BTC, and a tool to deceive noobs, the result must be pretty discouraging to big blockers, who I still regard as our brothers.

Users do not need to run nodes. **Peers** need to run nodes. Bitcoin is "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". If you are not running a node you ultimately trust someone, probably someone you don't know and never met. If you want to blindly trust strangers with your money that's your choice. For me there are too many people with malformed notions of how bitcoin should evolve to not run a node.

The S2X fork could be a non-event like Y2K but it has potential to completely ruin crypto as well. It's being taken very seriously by all major stake holders. It's a very complicated issue and would need days of investigation to fully appreciate the political and technical nuances involved. On the surface it seems to be a simple and subtle change to block size (transaction capacity of the network) but the implications are actually very profound. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:54:04
Don't expect Manticlops or anyone else to spend much time "helping you learn" or debunking your assertions, these arguments have been repeated thousands of times over the years. 
I'll give you a few minutes since there is some low hanging fruit I can make fall with a gentle nudge. 
Andreas Antonopolous, along with 99.9% of everyone involved in Bitcoin agrees a block size increase will probably be needed *some day*. Nonetheless, you should consider his examination of the benefits of block size increase [here]( Essentially it's not needed right now so it's not a priority. 
Let's discuss your earlier points.


So your pitch was low fees and quick confirmations? Confirmations have *never* been reliably less than ~10 min. With enough fees they still are. But low fees are not promised in the white paper. You were selling the idea of bitcoin with false promises that *you* (mistakenly) thought were what it's all about. It's not. It's about **decentralization**. Did you advertise Bitcoin as a *decentralized* trustless system? Because *that's* what's novel about it. That's what makes it special, valuable &amp; censorship resistant. That's why the white paper is titled "Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer cash system." The **peer-to-peer** part IS THE TITLE. You think you're a peer? You're not, not one of mine, unless you are running a full validating node you are just a user with a wallet. My node can't see you, you are not a peer to my node, you are a transaction among many in the block the miner sent me to validate. The actual *peers* in this system do not need to *trust* ANYONE, as everyone not running a node must. That freedom is not cheap. PEERS do not want an un-necessarily large blockchain because at some point for each PEER the blockchain can become un-affordable, forcing them to abandon the MOST critical feature, the very thing that sets Bitcoin apart and makes it revolutionary. That's what Satoshi designed and when his original code permitted unlimited block size it was quickly exploited as an attack vector. Satoshi realized the essential peer-to-peer nature would be destroyed unless blocks were made small enough for ordinary people (the intended "peers") to host the entire system on ordinary home computers. Bigger blocks are detrimental to Satoshis intended system.   


The empirical evidence is being produced now. When (if) BCH fills blocks to it's 8MB capacity you'll see fewer and fewer BCH nodes. While we wait for the proof (one way or the other) let's leave Bitcoin with as much decentralization, (facilitated by small blocks and optimizations) as we can. The point of decentralization is to defend against an attack which has not yet been attempted. If you doubt that, go try downloading a copy of the white paper from **Napster**.

For me it's convenience. No ID authentication process required. I've met others who use it because they can't satisfy exchange account ID requirements. 
Also, exchanges could be required to divulge customer data by authorities, or customer data could be hacked like any other centralized database. So financial privacy is an aspect which justifies higher fees.

The blocks are the same size (actually bigger, thanks to core/segwit) as they were when **Satoshi** set them to 1MB. Blame core? For what? 1MB is "part of satoshi's plan". How does any of that mean that miners mining empty blocks when transactions are waiting is "in the interests of the coin or the users"?

Daily limits and fee % charged varies from machine to machine or operator to operator. 
Industry average is ~9% and (max) limits can be $1000 - $10,000 per day.
Transaction fees (from the machine to your wallet) are typically set to "high priority" (~$5) and are (typically) deducted from the bitcoins you purchase. It's a sad truth that if you put $5 in a BTM you may get nothing. Buy at least $20 is all I can suggest.

Don't lecture others about reading the white paper as though you actually understand it, or as that it supports your position. You don't even seem to understand the title.   
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
You think you're a **peer**? You're not. Not to me, or to my node. Not unless you run a full node yourself. My node does not *see you*, you are not a *peer* to my node, you are not participating in the system as the title of the white paper outlines. You are just a user with a wallet and some private keys. You are a transaction among many in a block some miner sent me to validate. 
So when you say "Here people think they need to run non mining nodes" they are actually correct and it's you who does not understand "that nodes are important so you don't need to trust others even if a non mining nodes can do nothing about except not following the chain anymore". Nodes ARE the chain, miners merely service them.

In 2013 there were hundreds of solo miners, now hardly anyone mines solo, it's all just a couple dozen pools. Hows does this support your narrative that "More decentralization comes from more demand and use not by limiting blocksize.
Even with bigger blocks more miners will join, more pools and more businesses who run nodes."


There are FEWER nodes today as a PROPORTION of users than there was in 2013. There are more nodes in absolute numbers compared to 2013, but the number of new nodes has not kept up with the number of users. Again, how does this support your claim that "More decentralization comes from more demand and use not by limiting blocksize. Even with bigger blocks more miners will join, more pools and more businesses who run nodes."?

The first answer you got from OP was correct, Miners do what's best for them. 
You did not absorb that answer, you wanted an explanation, which I offered:  One example is mining empty blocks 
You did not absorb that explanation either. Instead you pivot to unrelated questions of blocksize and argued "How is paying a fee for the miners a bad thing" - something I never claimed. 
You *continue to debate* the cause of high fees, blaming core and Segwit1x for blocks being small (when core and segwit had nothing to do with blocksize - other than increasing them) even though it was Satoshi, in his wisdom, who made them 1MB.

Miners believe they will get more transaction fees if blocks are bigger instead of letting optimizations provide more tx capacity. Successful coin is one which does not drive away users.

Satoshis "vision", the white paper, was written before any actual code was tested. When Satoshi actually ran the code matching his vision he quickly found that having no block size limit was a *security flaw*, an *oversight* (because Satoshi is/was *human* and makes *mistakes*) spamming the blockchain became an attack vector to bloat the blockchain with the goal of reducing decentralization by making blocks and therefore the blockchain too massive for ordinary home computers to manage, so SATOSHI implemented a 1MB block size. 
Even more experienced Satoshi thought Satoshis original vision was broken. 
So in that regard BCH is closer to the "original vision" of Bitcoin, before Satoshi fixed one of the first vulnerabilities discovered with HIS original vision.

Indeed, and the simplest explanation for the actions of the NYA supporters is the motives I suggested. Occam's razor is satisfied.


[Conspiracy. That's a very appropriate word to use for the NYA.](
In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. Typically, the final goal is to gain power through a revolutionary coup d'état or through assassination. A conspiracy can also be used for infiltration of the governing system.


Nonsense. They are trying to "control it" by inserting a change they'd like to see and saying that is "Bitcoin". 


If that were so they'd want replay protection and would have implemented it, so they could have their "own chain" instead of this hijacking attempt.

WHY? If your answer is because you could sell now at 2X.. or even later at yX then you are not buying for the right reason, the right reason is more important than the gains. 
You need to examine the technology. Evaluate it on that level. Once you understand it's potential you'll probably see that selling bitcoins *for* fiat is less wise than buying bitcoins *with* fiat.

When I said bitcoins are backed by time, energy and math that was not hyperbolic its actually what its made of. As a rare byproduct of exploding stars gold is too. Both are scarce, and have other essential qualities of money such as portability, durability and so on. Both have utility, gold is a great conductor while Bitcoin is a public world wide ledger with unfalsifiable time stamping. In the next few years we will begin to see a variety of instruments "backed by" bitcoins. We already have loans using bitcoins as collateral. If anything, bitcoins 
have begun absorbing the economic functions that gold was traditionally used to fill, assimilating golds value beyond its qualities as a base metal and element on the periodic table.

Your link is not *contextually* related to my quote. 
I suppose a better reply to you would have been:


oh you're not?


So, by "by **not** running a node" you are **not** trusting strangers because you can "verify against many nodes *or by running a own node*"!
One of us is spouting nonsense. 
But let's examine your link anyway, to a quote of your own from Satoshi:
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and *don't generate*. (my emphasis on the word don't generate).
Don't generate "what"? Obviously Satoshi was talking about mining. So Satoshi was separating **mining nodes** (what he terms *network nodes*, or just *nodes*) from "the rest" [which] will be **client nodes** (that only do transactions). You see, back in 2010 the typical wallet user ran the Bitcoin-QT client, they mined on domestic computers. Your Satoshi quote was him anticipating a time when typical users did not mine, "letting users just be users". But since this was before thin clients, SPV and other lightweight wallets, Satoshi's "client nodes that only do transaction" were what we refer to today as full nodes. Satoshi assumed most users would be the sort of person early adopters were, and cling to [the privacy and security features that only full nodes offer]( even if and after they forego the mining arms race.

In some cases absolutely. Legacy banking is full of examples where people were blocked from sending their money where and when they wanted. Likewise there are many examples of multi millions being moved for under a dollar. Additionally, international remittance using Bitcoin has saved many people lots of money compared to using companies such as Western Union, when WU does not even services some places. Finally, "established fiat currencies" such as the Venezuelan bolívar have failed spectacularly since Bitcoin launched.

You still don't get it. I don't run a node to control what miners mine. At the same time, the economic activity routed through my node certainly does influence which chain miners work on (as a side effect) because they mine for profit which is found in fees.

What you have listed are not facts, they are just your opinion (as a basic user). 
You do not need to buy bitcoins to have access to other cryptos. 
Other cryptos simply do not approach bitcoins in value, because there are no better coins. 
All cryptos have trade offs, you will come to see, understand, and appreciate this eventually. 
Bitcoins is software, it can evolve and absorb any feature or function that proves worthwhile from any other coin, and will do so with far more security than any competition. It already has that advantage.

No government will create a digital currency which is permission-less, free to use, transparent, open sourced, decentralized and deflationary. 
Furthermore, the "social majority" will never loose faith in Bitcoin as long as those advantages exist, as well as the inevitability of the next global financial crisis within the legacy financial system. WHEN the next crisis does occur we will have Bitcoin as an alternative for mass adoption which we did not have in 2008.

Kevin Hobbs, the author of this 'newsletter', seems to have no idea what the key qualities of Bitcoin are which distinguishes it from national fiats, and any imitations of it that nations or central banks might make. 
Hope you read this Kevin so you can learn. 
Bitcoin is permission-less, free to use, transparent, open sourced, decentralized and deflationary currency. 
The national currencies that are considering going digital will inevitably feature permissioned access (for users and developers like the apple app store), they will be privatized, they will have fees, they will not be entirely transparent to everyone, they will not be open-source, they will definitely be inflationary to accommodate monetary policies of debasement and fractional reserve schemes, they will facilitate negative interest rates as well as central control of accounts for suspension/freezing of funds, bail-ins, bail outs, capital controls and of course transactions will include the identity of both sender and receiver and store that information in a centralized location for the convenience of hackers.
In light of these facts you should be wondering how fiat currencies will survive the coming digital revolution.

I don't think you've thought about this very deeply.


This is almost nonsensical. Bitcoin doesn't "have" or need money, it *is* money. "Manpower" is not a requirement of paradigm shifts, rather it is brain power. I point to previous paradigm shifts such as The Earth is flat &amp; Kings have a divine right to rule, as examples where all physical resistance was ultimately futile against movements which were started by very few individuals but grew. As for trust, there is the opensource code. Those who can read it only need to trust the laws of mathematics. Those who can't read the code can can still develop "faith" over time and through experience, just as everyone trusts the consistency of gravity or thermodynamics without understanding the theories behind them.


Every mainstream technology had early adopters. By definition those early adopters were regarded as deviants.  


Regardless, **a growing** number of people (millions?) are signalling a readiness to *use* crypto currency by using crypto currency. Making a *switch* (to crypto currency exclusively) is an unnecessary and idealistic standard.  


What is your criteria for a *real currency*? One wallet provider (just one, of many) reports almost 9 million accounts. 
There's about 139 countries in the world with fewer than 9 million people in them, almost all of them have their own, very real currencies.


That's a moon sized "if". The million(s?) of people that have decided, voluntarily, to use Bitcoin as an alternative to the systems that move, store and regulate fiat currency have done so because Bitcoin offers advantages over those legacy systems. Any country can create a digital currency using Bitcoin as a template, but they will never replicate *all* of it's features because doing so would require the sacrifice of seigniorage. Such loss of control is incompatible with the functioning of contemporary nation states. Such a difference *does* matter, when alternatives exist.

Somehow you seem to be missing the word and concept of "consensus".
There were a number of scaling proposals before layer 2, planned and coded and tested and presented to the world as BIPs such as 100 and 101. The hard fought consensus of the Bitcoin ecosystem was to defer those proposals, for now. Other coins are free to adopt those same or similar proposals but the name Bitcoin without any qualifier (such as cash) belongs to the project which has been shaped by and always respected broad consensus both pragmatically and philosophically.

Well, then maybe his point was that there are over 179 perfectly valid, currencies which are not USD, but which are regarded as money in their respective markets. "Money" does not need the status of world reserve currency, or be collectively accepted as money by all people's to be money, as those 179 monies demonstrate.
Aside from the highly debatable claim that USD is accepted worldwide, (Syria for example bans all foreign currencies for commercial trade, including USD and even plenty of Canadian merchants won't accept it at the counter), I reject the notion that Bitcoin "wants" or "needs" to be accepted at the level of USD or gold worldwide.

As an experienced user, what I like about bitcoin is that it's *not* privatised [cause fuck the man ;)]. It does not have a privatised agenda, it is open source and it's *public*. Free for anyone to use. No permission required. No fee to setup a wallet and receive bitcoins.   
My second pearl of wisdom for you is that the first 3 times you think you understand Bitcoin, you are wrong. Don't worry though, it's actually better than you think, all three times.

My guess is that they think (or know) that Bitcoin can't be destroyed with finality through price manipulation, only tamped down or delayed, "buying" themselves time to adapt. As for why a consortium/cartel/cabal seems plausible to me, rather than a singular entity, is because while, say, Putin could do much by himself, his actions would benefit many other entities with similar stakes but the cost would be his alone. You wouldn't take one for the team if everyone else on the team were a rival or competitor, you'd pitch the common good and negotiate a team effort.

TRADE only works if you are on the right side of the trade. People that TRADED away all the stocks and cryptocurrencies/tokens that went way up got rekt; only those that bought low and sold high are used to promote the 'TRADE' mentality. By no means am I telling you what to do with your money, but TRADE is as poor of an advice as any other. Bitcoin can still moon at any time. The developers are hardly idle.

I agree with you about not being able to co-opt Bitcoin, the protocol. I imagine daisybits should have said something like: "I'm worried some central banks and governments (big commercial banks too?) made agreements to use the power they wield of (fiat) money creation to hose the price of bitcoins by buying high and selling low as much as they want or can.
It's not a completely unreasonable concern given the economic tools and size of war chests some of these entities have. I can imagine international alliances between some central banks, cabals like the big six banks, IMF, Bilderberg-esq Groups... it only costs fiat, which they have plenty of and can produce more at will. It would make traders wealthy, and some are certainly doing well.
Bitcoin is a very real potential threat to the status quo. If such stake holders have not started building strategic alliances to combat that threat it's probably only a matter of time before they do.

I think his point was that there is *no* currency "collectively accepted as money by all people's",  except *perhaps* gold.

That may be an American centric cultural bias. For example, as a Canadian who visits Australia, are Aussie dollars priced in Canadian dollars, or are loonies priced in dollary-doos? That's rhetorical. It's merely a matter of perspective. They have a perfectly valid *direct* exchange rate (no need to convert to USD first) and the direction of exchange is irrelevant. Likewise bitcoins and any given fiat is directly convertible, and the direction is irrelevant. Thus, while unconventional, one might say USD and other conventional currencies *are priced in bitcoins*.

My point WAS that already at least 3 accredited schools already accept bitcoin for tuition. Yes, OP's debt is in dollars so must give back dollars. However since some schools can be paid for with bitcoins your statement that "You will always only pay your student loan in dollars.." is an obsolete belief.
However, since you've failed to walk back your statement about *always* *only* paying your student loan in dollars" I've decided my NEW point is that you're an asshat.  


I don't know why you're struggling to accept the reality I've presented. THREE schools. Accept bitcoin. Directly. "You will always only pay your student loan in dollars" does not jive with these facts, turkey. And before you say I'm not accepting the reality that we're talking about student LOANS rather than upfront tuition there are many places to get loans in bitcoins which must be paid back in bitcoins, that is to say, "the lender accepts bitcoin directly" as unlikely as that seems to you.
And others... Fucko.

BCH is not even compatible with Bitcoin! 


Chimps have 98% the same DNA as humans. They ain't human.  
A line by line change comparison will require a baseline to compare with. What version do you regard as "A"? The original Bitcoin client V 0.1.0? The last version where Satoshi Nakamoto was leading the project, V 0.3.19? The version which BCH is actually derived from, V 0.14? 
BCH changed more than 2 lines of code just with the ~~EDA~~ DAA change, which is a radical departure from one of the original features of the Bitcoin protocol, that's why it needed ~~a~~ two hard forks.

Not if 'utility' is measured by merchant adoption, BTM's and wallets which vastly favor BTC vs BCH.
As for "original Bitcoin doesnt exist anymore. Its an open source project, so "ripping off" isnt really a thing", if you found Satoshi Nakamoto's laptop and launched the bitcoin software on it, it would sync with the BTC blockchain not the BCH blockchain. Original BTC does exist and BCH is not it.

I think you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Before the satellite, bitcoin data was almost exclusively available through various ISPs. In other words, there were a limited number of ways to verify the blockchain. The blocksat provides an alternative source for that data which lessens reliance on those ISPs, and any trust required that the data ISPs provide is accurate.      
You can use your ISP to confirm the data from the blocksat is accurate, *and* **you can use the data from the blocksat to confirm the data from your ISP is accurate.** That's more decentralization than we had, not less.

Your failure to meet others who actually bought stuff with bitcoins is only indicative of your failure to socialize with other bitcoiners. You're talking with one right now. I've bought lots of stuff with bitcoins. 
I've been following bitcoin since 2011 as well, and I've also established a business where bitcoins change hands. Business is good.
The crash of 2018 is no different from several prior crashes where some people lost their shirts.

I'm sure about several fraudsters. They didn't want segwit so much as they wanted to steal bitcoins, cause a chainsplit, cause chaos to push a PoW change shitcoin, manipulate prices or do other schemes. Innocent ignorant people probably got sucked in too, so called useful idiots.
    
Are you sure they "lied about UASF", like did they confess to spreading falsehoods, or are you just assuming they knew they were wrong and could not possibly "just be wrong" (as you've been about a dozen times on this page). Moreover, even if some were deliberately lying or trying to cause disruption it does not follow that all UASF supporters did or wanted the same. It's not unreasonable to assume good intentions from those who generously donate time and energy to the decentralized health of the network. That's why I do, to feel like I'm contributing. Maybe I'm naive to assume other UASF'ers are like minded, and just as innocent. And because I see myself as innocent, and helpful, and generous, you talking like this to me makes me want to tell you to go pound sand up your ass with a hammer.

Once again you've ommited the the part where and how that would happen. Please fill me in and enumerate all your assumptions.   


If that's so then why are you so upset about this? It's like having a hissy fit about Y2K when you didn't even have a computer back then.


Yes, just like Mike Hearn rage quitting because he was not getting bigger blocks. Exactly the same. Not like a centralized mining cartel (which had quietly used it's patented mining advantage to eliminate competitors like KnC, Jupiter, BFL, Spondoolies and about 20 other makers of ASICs) looked like it was going to just veto network upgrades until it got the hard fork it wanted to cement it's centralized position of power. A rather different set of concerns if you ask me. 


Never used Gox cause I didn't need to buy, I was mining with GPUs before bitcoins reached 5$, didn't need to sell either, I've been hodling since before that was a thing. I've got enough to make you *really* fucking jealous. 


Confession? HAHAHAHA, I'm watching you lazy, pussy, bitches who didn't have the brains or balls to stand up to Bitmain and co after months of Jihan sneering at segwit.
I'm watching, you scaredy-cats who didn't have the guts to act like the "peers" you *think* you are. And I'm waiting for you to say THANKS. If your bitcoins are worth more than they were last spring then you owe guys like me some gratitude. We UASF veterans of the 2017 scaling wars are the reason we have Segwit today, because the 4k nodes like mine scared the comfort and conceit out of billionaires like Jihan Wu, Roger Ver and Barry Silbert. Yeah, we could have fucked it up, all of it, for them and everyone else, the whole thing. We could'a burned it all down with our rebellion, **and we made them stop us**. Do you fucking get it now? Are you connecting the dots?
UASF had a reasonable chance on it's own. We had mining, wallets, nodes. If we failed then bitcoin was already too centralized to salvage. Then again, if Bitmain blinked then we correctly bet the billionaires had more to loose than we did. Thanks to us the years long debate ended, the stalemate was finally over. Bitcoin moved forward, at last, and regained the world's confidence that governance is still decentralized and no asshole in China can veto upgrades if they don't suit his agenda. Yes, after that we had to fight Barry Silbert and DCG to kill the 2x part of his NYA, and guys like me will keep fighting for bitcoins future, even if cunts like you call us naive, stupid, confused, ignorant, incompetent, evil and malicious. And I'm, in great company; Samourai Wallet, Coinkite, Trezor, Coinomi, Slush Pool, Mycelium, Bitcoin Embassy/Bylls, Electrum, BitFury and too many others to mention all deserve credit as well.

Iron alloy like steel is used in construction because it's *far* stronger than Gold. Aluminum is used in Aerospace for it's weight to strength ratio. Gold is used in electronics because it has the best conductive properties for electronics.. at room temperature. These choices would be the same even if gold was as common as Iron or Aluminum. 


Nope. Ever see an Olympic gold medalist bite his/her medal? They ALL do that, it's a tradition, harking back to the days when gold was used for money, it's so soft you can leave a mark on it with your teeth (if it's very pure), offering a crude method of assaying that its "really" gold.

You seem to be trying very hard to portray UASFs as malicious and dishonest. Ironically, that's malicious and dishonest, on your part. 
 


You, me and everyone else here seems to be alive and well. Fuck off with your hyperbole.


No dumbafuck, to get segwit activated. 


? What fucking guarantee? Miners had not activated it for 6 months before the UASF proposal was started. There was no NYA back then or any other indication that miners were going to let it activate unless they got a block size increase first, multiple pools with enough hash power to "veto" BIP 141 demanded exactly that. 
..Or is that your fucking problem, you wanted a block size increase? With a hard fork? like a retard?


LOL, not withstanding the multiple replies to that "double UASF" proposal which propose counters to it, here's one of my own I thought up on the fly; "triple UASF". It's just more of the same. UASF nodes reject non-segwit blocks, "Double UASF" nodes reject segwit blocks, Triple UASF nodes reject blocks from nodes which reject segwit blocks. Now we've completely isolated both sides of the chain split. It might prevent a future reorg wiping out the non segwit chain, but then you have two distinct, isolated chains, one which is *exactly* what we have now, and one which looks like Bcash but with 1mb blocks and no EDA. Look at the market today to see which one would have survived, Shitforbrains.   


LOL "fake shit fork scam coins" There's *your* malicious dishonesty again, trying sooo hard to make UASF'ers look malicious and dishonest.


Oh please tell me what's different, on a technical level, professor.  


You must have been the only bitcoiner to miss the memo about not transacting while the chain split was unresolved. 


No branch wipe out and reorg is just the harsh reality of that sort of chain split. Double UASF would stop nothing, as I explained above, "invalidating UASF blocks" - i guess you mean simply ignoring/not adding them to the non segwit branch - that's what we hoped they's do (assuming they did not capitulate and activate BIP141), and mining empty blocks would be frustrating for anyone dumb enough to try and transact during the chain split, but each empty block they mine for us would get us closer to a difficulty reset. See? Game theory.


LOL, no there was never any possibility of the BIP 148 branch being wiped out in a reorg. Maybe you're so angry about all this because you've been misinformed about how it works and what could happen.


Wake up. UASF was a *potential* "hazard for miners and others". There was never any danger, unless the miners were unwilling to give the users what they wanted and waited for, what the developers had made for them, and what the nodes were telling them to activate.   


Oh? What law did I violate? Fuck you and your hyperbole. Your desperate attempt to make UASF'ers seem malicious and dishonest is nothing short of malicious and dishonest! What's wrong with running software we want to run on our own computers? Criminal indeed! Fucko.


Look cupcake, it's clear you want to make UASF'ers look bad, but using language like "threaten them" and "attack them" is more of your bullshit hyperbole. It's disgusting for you to portray us like violent thugs. We're just running our choice of software on our own computers. That's it. We're not "attacking", not even in a networking sense, there's no DDOS, no attempt to compromise security, infiltrate, damage or steal data from other systems. On the other hand, we're obliged to put up with Antbleed, covert ASIC boost, spamming the network to drive fees up to 50 fucking dollars to make a transaction, 6 months of obstructionism on scaling *the* world-wide-ledger while the community goes bipolar and alt coins nibble away at the crypto dominance index. You're OK with all that aint'cha, cupcake?   
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:43:39


Illogical or not that what we did. 


No, you are wrong. We didn't think there were any guarantee, it was very risky, we all knew that. Nonetheless, no-one can stop a node from running what ever software the owner wants.  


Yeah, google didn't find this "double UASF". Link it. What you are describing is miners deliberately creating empty blocks on the competing chain. Not very sporting and the backlash from that would be very bad for business.


No, it would not have been. 


The whole point of UASF was to activate segwit *without* a hard fork because contentious hard forks create alt coins.


Soft forks don't create altcoins. They *can* create chain splits, but those *can* be temporary.  


You don't seem to have a very good understanding of the potential UASF outcomes technically, nor the relevant game theory, or even the nature of the ultimatum behind the movement. Had BIP 148 activated transactions on the non-segwit chain had a possibility of being wiped out by a future reorg (even if that was improbable). No such possibility existed on the segwit chain. All the risk was put on the non segwit side of the fork.     


BIP 148 was not risky enough, for me. There had to be a good chance we'd burn the whole fucking thing to the ground if the Bitmain cartel continued to demand a block size hard fork before implementing segwit. 
 


Fraud is not the right word. Perhaps brinksmanship. We knew the risks. Miners knew the risks, and they always had the ball in their court. If they wanted to avoid those hazards they could (and ultimately did) simply activate segwit through any other means to disarm the BIP 148 threat. UASF was a complete success. 


And yet, after years of development and testing, with fees and confirmation times at all time highs, and everyone screaming and fighting, when segwit was packaged and delivered it sat there un-activated for MONTHS while miners held the whole future of bitcoin hostage holding out for block size increase. Had they gotten what they wanted with that that tactic they would have demonstrated they "control" bitcoin, and gotten the bigger blocks which would entrench that imbalance of power.    


In the end we got segwit. There is no such thing as "fake" segwit. 


Oh but you do?


Please do. Every one of them.


We BIP 148 node operators would have given it a go. We'd been preparing to make a stand for months with the hash power we had. Slush pool was onboard and other smaller pools too. If we could make enough block to get to a difficulty adjustment we could carry on with our segwit enabled bitcoin. If miners tried to fill our chain with empty blocks some would have hard forked to a new hashing algo, but I would have declared the bitcoin project a failure and many other would have as well. It would have been abandoned en mass in favor of another block chain. Bitcoin developers had done their job in providing scaling solutions which did not sacrifice any decentralization but those solutions came too late and could not be implemented because hash power had already become too centralized. That's our reasoning.    
Now, let's hear about why you're so hot under the collar about this UASF non-event, which simmered for months but was safely resolved weeks before you even created this reddit account of yours.

For you to think "the odds if it running up again are so slim", you must believe we've run out of people willing to adopt bitcoin, that we've hit peak adoption. I think that's wrong, it must be if even one exchange has staff processing new sign-ups. In actuality less than 1% of the world has used bitcoin. We have a long way to go.

@_date: 2018-02-10 14:53:42
I ran a UASF node and I am a (hobby) miner. My hash power is insignificant, my main contribution to Bitcoin is selflessly running a node for the benefit of everyone, and I've been doing this for years. 
Up till last summer Bitmain, which had a dominant proportion of hash power, had resisted implementation of segwit (despite popular demand for it) because segwit would ruin it's covert asic boost mining advantage, which it had used to become the dominant miner. Some of us could see that *not* implementing segwit was an existential threat to the future of Bitcoin. If it did not scale in a decentralized manner it would die. So, with little to lose (because of Bitmains selfish, stubborn greediness along with an army of the useful idiots like Roger Ver and people he's bamboozled with bullshit), node operators like me loaded up BIP 148 nodes with the intention of forking off to create a segwit chain, with or without majority hash power, and taking all our nodes with us. 
So here I am. Let's hash this out. I'm ready to defend my stance on BIP 148. And I'd like to see you to defend your positions: 






You say you wanted segwit, but not at the cost of a chain split. I wanted segwit *even if* we had to chain split, because if we did not there would eventually be no bitcoin chain worth having. Just look at the fees in December. $50? That's *with* the relief afforded by segwit. Where is the scam, the fraud, the pump and dump, the evil in this? 
BIP 148 is/was not *fake* segwit. It was a risky and radical activation method but some of us felt it was needed to break Bitmains stalling which it had done for most of a year. That time frame was marked by hysterical disagreements made desperate by the urgent need for progress on scaling, when segwit was needed as a precursor to LN. 
Everyone running a BIP 148 node wanted Bitcoin to survive. None of us wanted Bitcoin to fail or to scam others. We did what we thought we must, for the good of Bitcoin, and I for one would do it again. My only regret was that Jihan Wu was so shamed by the righteous determination of the BIP 148 movement, that to save face he created Bcash which made the community split probably permanent.

Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is how Bitcoin was designed to solve disagreements. Some folks (21 members of the Bitcoin Unlimited group) refused to accept the results of that mechanism and formed a separate consensus among themselves to create an alt coin by forking Bitcoin. 
Some members of that smaller, separate, community have been trying for many months to deceitfully claim that the fork they created (BCH) is the coin still governed by broad consensus (BTC).
The failure of BCH fans to self-censor their own loud and dishonest members is the reason the market has decidedly rejected BCH as a more valuable cryptocurrency.   
Edit: That last sentence is just one of the reasons.

Gold really only has intrinsic value after its been mined and refined. One might argue gold ore is typically  pretty worthless as a conductor or whatever until those processes imbue the material with usefulness. With that in mind, refined gold mainly represents the energy and effort expended in those processes to make it useful, highlighting those other production inputs as the real source of value. Even further inputs are needed to turn a gold bar into electronics.

Bitcoin has been growing stronger, more robust, more useful, more widespread pretty much daily, for years.

Your country has not yet come around to legalizing recreational marijuana. Following policy changes in several other countries, Canada has. It comes into effect this June. That's a result of the government concluding that the cost of cops, courts and correction is not a worthwhile expenditure of public resources in a futile attempt to control weed.. nor is it popular. The government is not doing us a "favor", it's a simple matter of pragmatism and popularity. The same will eventually happen with crypto, and for the same reasons, even if scams and pointless speculation happens in the space, even if the government temporarily regulates or bans it.

Well then the number of wallets which support Segwit is the indication that fees and capacity are not urgent problems. Point being there is no shortage of solutions to reduce fees and increase capacity without going to larger blocks. *Your insistence* (above) that "This *is* about blocksize. Fees are too high. Transaction throughput is too low" is either ignorant of, or ignores, these facts. Sorry if that's inconvenient for your narrative.

I think it probably is. 
Firstly, there is no clear indication anywhere that any "major countries" actually *want* to "shut it down", and much less indication they even *could* shut it down.  I for one laugh at the probability, and think an *attempt* to do so would merely demonstrate that governments impotence (which would undermine that governments authority). It would seem there've been no significant attempts in that regard, for that reason. 
More importantly though, why do you think not having easy access leads to declining value? Scarcity typically leads to increased value.

If it's true that some charge 20%, (which is more than +50% deviation from the 9% average), then there must also be machines with less than -50% deviation from the average, (or charging less than 4.5%) for the average to be accurate.

I thought decentralization was a means to an end, the
redundancy of nodes (decentralization) yields no central point of failure, which in turn conveys *censorship resistance*. You're saying the *purpose* of blockchain is to be *decentralized* (and that purpose is defeated by *Layer 2 (like Lightning)*), when the **purpose** of decentralization (and hence blockchain) is prevention of censorship of transactions. LN introduces no such opportunity for censorship so how does it "defeat" the purpose of blockchain?


In addition to what I just said, LN is truly P2P (even if a LN tx requires a P2P2P2P.., all participants are peers) while tx on the Bitcoin base layer typically involves various participants who are not peers at all. A user on an SPV wallet broadcasts her tx to a given node, which spreads the tx to other nodes (it's peers) until the tx reaches a miner who includes it in a block, and then the solved block is relayed to other nodes until it reaches the node the SPV wallet user is connected to before she sees a confirmation. The SPV user is not a peer to any node, nor to the miner. If the tx recipient is another SPV user you can see there are third parties. **So typical transactions on the Bitcoin base layer requires third parties to the tx, while tx on LN does not!**

Yes, however there are many ways to preserve or even recover lost anonymity.

You traded your bitcoins for something and then received bitcoins on an opendime for something else.

Ethereum forked to become Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) under completely different circumstances. It was not a planned or proposed fork it was a disaster recovery demanded by the ETH users after the DAO hack and was furnished by the benevolent dictator Vitalik. ETH users who were not invested in DOA had much to loose (immutability) and nothing to gain from the split (except possibly salvaging the reputation of the ETH chain).  Those dynamics are not present here. There is no crisis to justify this hasty fork bereft of meaningful features and no benevolent dictator to award the mantle of original name to the new fork.

OK, let's assume BTC price has stabilized. 
Now consider the buying power of $100 USD. With 2-3% inflation per year USD looses 20-30% of that buying power over 10 years. That's without compounding. 
So let's say you have $5,000 worth of Bitcoins, why would you prefer USD, why would you sell your BTC for USD? You can always exchange BTC for goods or services you need, as you need them, but storing your wealth makes much more sense in Bitcoins.

I ran a UASF node, I also have old mining gear. How much hash power do I have, Nostrodomus? 


But UASF did have a double digit percentage of nodes and was gaining nodes at an accelerating pace, and had been for weeks. Besides,  simple majority assures nothing. Network topography could render a powerful miner ring fenced by UASF nodes leading to unexpected results. Bitmain knew this, Bitmain was scared.

Like many in the UASF camp my equipment was not active prior to the UASF flag day, (other than a brief test in June), and I didn't need to activate it on flag day because Segwit activated through BIP91 before the Aug 1st. date, so there is no way of knowing the actual hash power which might have been allocated other than to say there was more than you ever saw. 


BIP148 nodes would reject blocks made by miners who were not signalling for Segwit after Aug 1, yielding a 100% signal rate on the UASF branch. Why do you think it would not eventually activate and be useful?

I think some (fools) imagine that off chain transactions somehow break the intended function of bitcoins or in some other way reduce the legitimacy of transactions. They don't. Nearly every bitcoin anyone has was initially acquired through an online exchange which shuffled the owners of those bitcoins offline. Likewise, private keys attached to physical objects such Casascius coins or Coinkite Opendimes were designed with off chain transactions in mind.

UASF hash power was deliberately kept offline before the fork to minimize the difficulty faced after the fork. As well as being a obvious strategic maneuver doing that had the additional tactical advantage of keeping strength and therefore potential success uncertain. That increased the potential risk of resisting activation of Segwit via any BIP available. Miners folded, they don't get to see if we were bluffing.

BIP8 is a modification to BIP9. BIP9 was the deployment mechanism for soft forks in the past that relied on miners signalling 95% readiness for activation. It was successfully used to activate BIP65 (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and BIP68/BIP112/BIP113 (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY/Median Time). BIP9 allows for upgrades to the system whenever a supermajority of miners are ready to enforce the changes, allowing for faster upgrades than a UASF may allow. Every 2016 blocks, if 95% of those blocks signalled readiness for the proposed change, the soft fork enforcement would become mandatory in 2016 blocks. Each change is given a fixed timeframe to achieve this activation, such that any change that is not activated may have its bit reused. Proposals that do not achieve activation expire at the end of their time period, but may be renewed if there is sufficient interest.
BIP8 modifies BIP9 to automatically convert into a UASF at the end of its activation time. This avoids the problem of a miner veto while still allowing miners to begin enforcing the rules sooner than a pure UASF would allow. Once the final period completes after the timeout period, the rules become mandatory, regardless of signalling.
There was a proposal made by Shaolinfry to use BIP8 to deploy SegWit. The proposal would set a new version bit for deployment after the current proposal would expire, and would lock-in in April 2018. Miners would still be able to activate SegWit prior to the this date, but failure to activate would result in a mandatory lock-in.

Oh but technically it is! If Satoshi Nakamoto ever decided to spend his BITCOINS the private keys he controls would let him spend on the BCH chain. (Technically correct is still correct, right :P)
Unfortunately for everyone who is 'all in' on BCH, they cannot send their tokens to any wallet the creator of Bitcoin ever used. 
As for Segwit being "*crammed* in as a very *complicated* soft fork", it actually slid perfectly in to place, as though Bitcoin was designed with Segwit in mind, the activation mechanism could only be more simple if it had a flag day. Maybe you could go cram your meaningless verbs and adjectives up your ass.

No because "everyone who existed at the time" (like you and me before we heard of Bitcoin) is not the same as "community consensus" which is people using the software. When Satoshi and Hal Finney were the only 2 ppl running the software they were the entire community.
I get what you're saying. Everyone should (and even can) be able to revert to the versions, (with features, or lack there of) which had consensus when they first adopted Bitcoin. My understanding is that every version of Bitcoin Core is still fully backward compatible with all earlier versions.
My point being that there's justification to run earlier versions which match rules you consented to when you joined the network, (by voluntarily joining the network), but that point in time is not arbitrary.

Yes I will defend my views. From my perspective in 2017 Bitcoin advancement was being held hostage by a cartel of miners. This centralization of power by a numerically microscopic group of individuals represented an existential threat to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. They were essentially exercising unilateral control of development by blocking an upgrade which seemed to have a strong majority of support from users (nodes), developers and businesses. If that circumstance could not be rectified then, to me, the project would be a failure, Bitcoin would ultimately be worthless due to a miscalculation in the game theory. My own belief was, and is, that miners intransigence left me with nothing to loose. Philosophically, the experiment would be over one way or another unless Segwit was activated. Participating in the UASF rebellion against miners was my way of forcing them to pay a price for the self serving control they were trying to seize. The choice UASF gave them, and everyone, was to accept the will of the majority, live with the consequences of a potentially broken system or leave the Bitcoin ecosystem altogether.

Why should everyone who fought so hard to avoid a chain split have to endure a second hard fork (and inevitable second chain split 6 months later anyway) after the miner supported BU group caused a chain split?

At one point XT had major support but never had majority support. Same with BU. Certainly neither had a *super majority* of support, or they would have forked. BIP 141 (Segregated Witness) required such a super majority to activate (95%). However BIP 91 (which was identical to BIP 141 reduced the threshold to 80%. **Over 80% of miners supported BIP 91, that's why and how it activated, that's why we have Segwit.** You saying "Prior to SW2X SW BIP voting had somewhere around 20% support" that's off by over 100%, there was more than twice that. 
You denying that "SW, on its own, was supported by a majority of mining hashpower is patently false" is a provable lie, and a bullshit attempt to revise history. 
BIP 91 only activated SW, ON IT'S OWN, that's all BIP 91 did. It incorporated no flag date for a 2x hard fork. You can say it should have had one. You can say miners should not have voted/signaled for BIP 91 since it didn't, BUT OVER 80% OF THEM DID.

You say "a divided community will hurt much more than a hard fork", but a hard fork would ironically give you both the hurt you acknowledge a fork would produce, *as well* as the divided community you are trying to avoid. 
From what I see with Ether, "Hard forks are exactly the tool *not* to use", if your primary concern is avoiding a damaging schism. Everyone should be in favour of avoiding a damaging schism. 
In principal, I'm in favour of bigger blocks, and I believe almost all Core devs and their supporters are too, eventually. The reason projects like SW and LN are *priorities* right now are because transaction malleability is a serious problem that *won't be fixed by bigger blocks" and should be fixed *ahead* of the mass adoption that bigger blocks are intended to encourage (but I think asking the uninitiated to understand, evaluate and choose between 2 separate Bitcoin blockchains would be disastrous for adoption).  
Impatience may be the greatest threat Bitcoin has ever faced. I'm in favour of watching how separate branches of Ethereum performs in terms of adoption. Transaction limits are only a temporary inconvenience on *the* blockchain, while efforts to split *the* blockchain could be both destructive and irreversible.       
I assure you I understand the arguments about opportunity cost. 
I've thought about it at length and considered the risk and reward that each alternative offers.
  
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:32:26
Decentralization (the whole point of blockchains) requires every full node (ideally run by ordinary folks like me) to maintain a complete record of the entire blockchain, which contains every transaction. Ordinary folks like me can do so on ordinary lap top computers, for now. However, as the ecosystem grows the size of the blockchain and resources needed to run nodes will grow as well. Attempting to scale to global proportions "on-chain" will eventually exceed the ability of ordinary people to provide nodes. Then the only nodes will be large organizations. That is centralization. To avoid that fate BTC developers have devised a second layer on top of the blockchain which will let ordinary folks continue to provide the back bone of the project.

You're talking about the decision to create of BCH? There were 21 members of the Bitcoin Unlimited group who voted to do that. I fit more people in my swimming pool. How is that a consensual representation of the wishes of millions of people with a stake in Bitcoin? The community spent years polling, debating and  discussing a block size and the vast majority rejected a hard fork to increase blocksize. No, not consensus. The resulting contentious hard fork creating 2 separate incompatible chains leaves no other interpretation.


Segwit, BIP 141 activated through BIP 9 which demanded 95% of blocks signal for activation. It's a super majority. Yes, I regard that as consensus.  


What lie? Satoshi set the block size to 1MB himself in 2010. You can ask him yourself what his reasons for that were, but people he spoke to say it was to address the block chain bloat being caused by abusive spam.

You're right, Sw2x was just one of many attacks from the "big block" camp. I'll summarize how for any newcomers who read this.
Small blocks are a security parameter set by Satoshi Nakamoto. Small blocks protect Bitcoin in a few ways, all of them related to decentralization. Decentralization is why Bittorrent is alive and well, while centralized Napster was dismantled long ago. Decentralization is crucial to prevent minority interests (such as a government or mining cartel) from hijacking the public utility protocol and changing it to suit their own interests. This decentralization is fostered by small blocks firstly by making resources on the blockchain scarce. Resource scarcity means spammers cannot stuff blocks full of economically meaningless transactions for *free*. The anti-bloat objective is to *minimize the discouragement* that ordinary people using ordinary computers may face when running fully validating nodes, since those need to store the entire block chain. It's not only storage, it's also bandwidth which is an economic burden which some people cannot afford, and latency. Latency is the time a node needs to validate the contents of a block before it propagates it to the rest of the network. Bigger blocks increase the amount of data being validated every 10 minutes which increases latency, which favors larger mining pools who find blocks (and collect block rewards and tx fees) more often than small pools. Because the mining pool which found a block can start searching for the next block while nodes are still validating and propagating a block recently found, and because large blocks increase latency, larger pools gain an additional advantage over smaller rivals, again reducing decentralization and encouraging centralization. Thus both nodes and miners are faced with a centralizing pressure when blocks size is increased.
One of the ways decentralization protects network participants is by increasing the requirements for consensus. Consensus means broad agreement about implementing proposed changes. A centralized authority can make changes which are self-serving, while a system which requires consensus from a decentralized group is more aligned with the interests of the many. 
Decentralization is therefore defense. It's always better to overshoot security than undershoot it. The reason security matters so much is that as a disruptive technology, which challenges the most powerful institutions man has ever built, it has powerful and indefatigable enemies. Enemies which will do everything they can to delay or destroy the threat to themselves.  
The big block camp would trade security for lower fees, hoping it encourages adoption, which would help them "get rich quick"-er. That's understandable. However simply increasing the block size as they'd like requires a hard fork to the consensus rules, BCH is such an example. As predicted such a controversial hard fork created a chain split because it lacked consensus. A chain split will always splinter and divide the community and it's not hard to see that the enemies of bitcoin have been highly motivated to encourage such a hard fork to Bitcoin for a long time. The enemies of Bitcoin have been fanning this block size controversy all along, HKA, BU, XT, NYA &amp; SW2X are all battles they lost.          
Not everyone who wanted such a hard fork is an enemy of bitcoin, but every enemy of bitcoin wanted such a hard fork and an unknown proportion of people who support BCH are such enemies, not all but some. Maintaining consensus, evolving the software with the will of the entire decentralized network can be difficult and frustrating but it's a feature not a bug.

You say my logic is misleading but offer nothing which supports that claim, what a surprise.


You don't seem to understand the concept of consensus very well. The consensus I "envision" is that changes only happen when there is consensus (unless you want to create an alt-coin, you're always free to do that without permission). There was consensus for SegWit to activate, (as I said a 95% super majority of miners signaled for it) so it activated. There was no consensus for a block size increase, so that proposal was not implemented. That's lack of consensus in action. There was consensus among 21 Bitcoin Unlimited people to create create an alt-coin, BCH, so it was created. Consensus (or collectivism, the thing you're not interested in) is a feature, not a bug. It prevents the global system from being altered to fit the wants of a minority, whether that's a government or someone like Jihan Wu. That's the whole point of decentralization.    
Looking at your supposed email evidence that Bitcoin was MEANT to increase the block-size, I see "block-size" not mentioned, even once. This is not even weak evidence, there's no evidence at all. It's even written at least a year before Satoshi himself decided to reduce the block size to 1 MB, so even if he said in 2008 that *he meant* for block-size to become bigger (which it seems he did not)*he changed his mind* in 2010. Even if there was an intention for that block-size decrease to be temporary (and I don't see evidence of any such intention) there's certainly no indication of *how temporary*. A decade? A century? Who are you, (or anyone) to say that time is up? The answer is all of us (collectivisim, that thing you're not interested in) and the mechanism is consensus.    


The BTC programmers you accuse of being deciders write software and then, very deliberately, make activation contingent on others to adopt or not. That's OBVIOUS from examples such as SegWit. If developers had any control SegWit would have been activated as soon as it was delivered. Instead the community argued about it for 9 months. You even acknowledge this yourself when you say "programers don't matter". That's a self contradiction. My logic is not misleading, it just conflicts with your illogical beliefs.
As for your ton of Bitcoin enthusiasts now on BCH, that's not shocking news. I debated block-size with many people here and elsewhere for years. Since BCH was an air drop everyone got some, naturally fans of big blocks are "now on BCH". Nonetheless, it would appear "a ton" of Bitcoin enthusiasts dumped those air dropped tokens on the market and remained with BTC, including and especially "a ton" of the exact same Bitcoin enthusiasts from 2012.

I've seen chimps who think they're people. Their opinions do not change reality. A chimps DNA is 99% the same as people but that difference prevents fertile intercourse with people. This functional incompatibility is overarching, no matter that both are primates. So it is with BCH. BCH is very similar to BTC, both are viable crypto currencies (primates in this analogy), but BCH is functionally incompatible with the living Bitcoin blockchain created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The opinion of some BCH fans that they are holding real Bitcoins is a cigar smoking chimps delusion, and it's being nurtured by Roger Ver's deceptive behavior. Indulging such fantasy, as you are doing, by not "deny them agency and the ability to claim they are the real, better vision of bitcoin because they don't need my permission" might feel unbiased and kind to them, but it's also unfair to the majority of network participants such as node operators, the economic majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts, the developers who've guided the phenomenal growth of Bitcoins value through improvements since Satoshi disappeared, as well as all the businesses who've built their brands on a specific implementation (and reputation) of this years old project, not to mention being rude to the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto who designed a brilliant system where change depends on consensus.        


You are describing a contentious hard fork. In such a scenario the two chains would not be compatible with each other, however one (but not both) of those chains would still be compatible with the pre-fork chain. That's exactly what we have with BTC, it's still compatible with older versions while BCH is not. The economic majority might go with either, as we saw with Ethereum, but in that  specific case the new branch was given the old name and the original branch was renamed "Ethereum Classic" by, and because there is a leader, Vitalik Buterin to make such decisions on behalf of the community. Bitcoin no longer has such an authority figure, so by default the unchanged branch retains the unchanged name. That's entirely consistent with both the technical functional compatibility I've explained, as well as the traditional naming conventions applied in all opensource software development. Note, my *opinion* on all that is *irrelevant*, just like the beliefs and opinions of cigar smoking chimps.

No, bitcoin mining on a lap top CPU or GPU is competitively futile since production of application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips which are designed to do nothing except mine the SHA256 algorithm.   
The Bitcoin Core software is a combination Node and Wallet, and *can* also mine, but standard hardware (CPU &amp; GPU) is not cost effective energy wise to mine with. You could connect ASICs to the node and mine, if you wanted. I just use the node &amp; wallet. The Node function contains the ledger and can validate transactions (particularly my incoming transactions without deferring to some other node I don't control). The node also propagates valid blocks to other listening nodes, and provides the entire ledger contents to other nodes catching up with the state of the network. There is no reward  for running a node unless you mine, then you can get block rewards and collect transaction fees. The only incentive for running a non mining node is helping the network, participating in the consensus process and validating your own transactions.

The information recorded in the ledger is immutable. In that regard it's the first infallible time stamp service backed by global consensus. You can include a few bytes of data with a transaction, which can contain a hash of some document. That let's you prove a specific prior time when it existed, a poor man's patent and much more. That's one unique intrinsically valuable application among many that have yet to be developed.

There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them, social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.
 
In Canada we have several crown corporations which amounts to social ownership of the corporations.
The same is true in plenty of European countries. Private ownership of property is irrelevant with regards to which countries are "socialist". If private ownership of property were the litmus test for which countries are socialist then Venezuela would not qualify since anyone, even foreigners can buy property there. 


Not sure where you get your information but apparently there are "[Landlords] with three or more properties.." which would indicate the existence of entrepreneurs, who also own property.

Do you ride a motorcycle? In many cities motorcycles pay a reduced fee for parking, some cities don't charge motorcycles for parking at all, not just ion municipal lots but even on the street. Such moves are incentives for people who create less congestion on roads, use less space for parking spots, and ultimately burn less fuel which causes smog.  
The objective is not to get everyone to ride motorcycles, it's to reward those who do, because they burden the system less than those who do, which is better for the system as a whole.
The analogy here is that Jihan is protesting the cheaper parking and fuel bills that motorcycles enjoy on behalf of car and truck drivers who pay regular fees.

There are coming optimizations to improve the use of block space resources. We should encourage their development, activation and adoption by keeping blocks at the present capacity. After we run out of ideas for optimizations which can be implemented with soft forks  it would be a better time to consider additional improvements which can only be done via hard fork. By then I hope there will be several other improvements which need a hark fork to deploy and could be rolled in. Off the top of my head, a well crafted governance mechanism to make future upgrades less messy would be nice.

I'd like to point out that so far we've found no way to change 1MB to 2MB without a HF. Anyone who's business model is threatened by Bitcoin and wants Bitcoin to fail (enemy's of Bitcoin) would love to see a HF. ANY hard fork. It would not matter if the HF is for the sake of 2MB or BU or faster block times or whatever. A HF would be an opportunity to support the minority chain, and thereby spoil both the immutability claim as well as the 21 million hard cap, while also dramatically complicating the introduction of new adopters. Such damage would be incalculable and permanent.  
I'm not saying everyone in favor of a HF is an enemy of bitcoin. I'm saying every enemy of bitcoin wants a HF, to divide the actual blockchain the way the community is now divided.

As early as 2010 it was observed that someone (probably many people) were spamming the blockchain with millions of tiny 0.00000001 bitcoin transactions. These transactions are recorded in the blockchain forever, taxing every node with keeping the data on hard drives and wasting the resources of every node on purpose. long term this would discourage people from running nodes, which is a voluntary activity, without reward, and the backbone of decentralization. Decentralization is the reason Bittorrent is alive and well while Napster got crushed.

Let's review: 
You say Venezuela is not a social democracy.
I show you are wrong, it is **democratic**, and yes very socialist
You say "social democracy" generally refers to something resembling a European nation, which is far friendlier to business and private property than Venezuela is.
I correct you that the term applies to a **socialist** system of government achieved by **democratic** means. 
You say Governments with free markets are almost universally NOT socialist.
I explain there are many varieties of socialism and that social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms with examples in by Canada and Europe. 
You say [since] "You can own property in Canada and in virtually every country in Europe. They're not socialist countries."
I demonstrate property ownership is common in socialist Venezuela.
You claim Venezuela basically forbids its citizens to engage in business, you also suggest that the authorities would rather "just make everyone starve".
I provide proof that businesses and entrepreneurs are not forbidden in Venezuela. 
Since I've had to school you every step so far, let's continue! 
Now you recognise that "Canada and Europe are maybe a degree **more** socialist" than the US, but not by much (fully socialist healthcare).
 
Oh a fucking lightbulb!
"[But] that doesn't make is a "socialist" country." 
{facepalm} You've got socialised schools, socialised police, socialised courts, socialised prisons, socialised military, socialised roads, waterways, firefighters, parks, social security and socialised losses from your privatised banks but, oh no, the US is NOT a "socialist" country. You keep telling yourself that. 


Oh I see now, this is really about Venezuela nationalising it's oil industry and in the process evicting American companies from it's territory (and the world's largest proven oil reserves). Really? That was 40 years ago! Get over it. It's not as if the US doesn't claim and exercise the right of eminent domain from time to time. That's right, the US can and does seize private property and uses those assets for it's social programs, in fact it does so daily, if you include civil forfeiture. 
Look, South American countries are pretty poor in the first place. The government in Venezuela is not very good at governing. I'd bet they're very corrupt too. Nonetheless the people of socialist Venezuela were not starving before the price of oil crashed. Nor can you point to a pattern of people starving in other socialist countries (except perhaps for North Korea which is A) full tilt communist and B) a global outcast). Rather than blame socialism for the current crises, isn't it more logical to chalk it up to the obvious and well known hazards of monoculture, especially when most of the economic output of an entire nation is dedicated to that one product and the world price for it collapses?

Agreed, but IMHO we need to complete (yet not rush) scaling solutions *before* the rest of the world catches on. It's a critical priority over expanding the user base.

Banks create fiat money out of thin air. I've long suspected they have been using some of this unlimited money to buy  bitcoins and then happily sell them at a loss in an effort to manage the price. This would let them apply some control over the hype/excitement, which forestalls adoption, which thereby buys them time. Time to let excitement die, time to develop a counter strategy, time to manipulate law makers. I have no proof of any of this, it's just what I'd do if I were steward of a very large bank and had massive slush funds for such ops. On the other hand such a scheme would eventually enrich active traders and might eventually appear as a hole in books under the scrutiny of shareholders. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if such a scandal were eventually revealed. After all, they've been caught rigging other games in the past.

Since you don't seem to have any idea, Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The "original" working client that Satoshi coded himself was version 0.1. He remained project leader through development to version 0.3.16. There is no doubt, whatsoever, among anyone, that version of the software Satoshi was running is and was Bitcoin. BTC today is an unbroken continuation of that blockchain in every way. The present version of the reference client is version 0.16 and it's backward compatible with the V0.3.16 node that Satoshi was running as lead developer. BCH, on the other hand is not compatible with any previous version of the Bitcoin software, not V0.1, not V0.3.16, not V0.16 or any of the other 50+ versions the reference client has grown through. Satosh Nakamoto, with his unquestionably "real" bitcoin node running 0.3.16 could not interact with the BCH chain, at all. Likewise, no BCH transaction would be recognized by Satoshi's 0.3.16 node.  
Conclusion: Yes, there is a real Bitcoin and BCH is not it. 
So your opinion(s): 






.. is complete horse-shit. 
BCH does not compute. Not according to Satoshi Nakamoto's node. **Therefore BCH is not Bitcoin**. 
And that's without even mentioning the norms and conventions in open source software development. Ubuntu is not the real Debian.
Your whole post and presence in this thread seems to be about subtly lending legitimacy to BCH as having a claim to the Bitcoin name. I'm glad to spoil all your work because as I've demonstrated, it does not.

Nothing in the link you provided supports your claim that Bitcoin was **MEANT** to increase the block size. So if you have any such evidence produce it or STFU. 
Maybe you're thinking of this Satoshi quote: "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it".
For the reading comprehension challenged, "WE" is a collective term implying consensus. Consensus means general agreement among a group of people. In Bitcoin, a super majority of 95% agreement has been the standard for that. Additionally, Satoshi's use of "IF" is a conditional term, a *possibility* (which might entail *never*), but more pointedly "IF" defies your claim that Bitcoin was MEANT to increase the blocksize. Furthermore, deciding when such conditions have been met is not a decision that any minority group (such as the Bitcoin Unlimited group of 21 people who decided to create BCH) is entitled to make for the wider community. If it were, you'd have a centralized system, which is why BCH is unpalatable to most Bitcoin enthusiasts, BCH does not prioritize the most important feature of Bitcoin, decentralization.        
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:31:48
I share your concern. It's a question Ive been asking myself. 
I think the answer is no. Politics won't prevent a HF, politics will eventually cause one. 
The damage from a HF right now is not worth any proposed benefits. Tomorrow might be different. 
Once the benefits outweigh the costs for an economic majority we will see a HF of some kind. 
Transaction capacity and fees are not even the biggest problem. We have adoption growth despite diminishing performance. The bigger problem is centralization. Asicboost has almost certainly eliminated some competition in the mining sector. Even maintaining 1mb blocks will not arrest that trend. If things keep going the way they are a HF to a new POW might be they only way to salvage decentralization in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:31:35
It's almost certain someone would continue to mine the 1mb chain after any HF resulting in 2 chains. The reasons range from philosophical to diabolical.

I don't disagree with you. However, I've given the whole BTC/BCH schism a lot of thought over the years and OP is not wrong either. Many of the r/btc folk really are on the same side as us, here's what I think went wrong and how they've been led astray. 
During the years long scaling debate, here, before the schism, there were lots of earnest bitcoiners  who genuinely thought bigger blocks were the right solution (especially miners and others who's business would benefit from bigger blocks at the expense of volunteer node operators). However, increasing the block size in the way they wanted required a hard fork. It was widely discussed that without consensus for such a fork it would split the community. That's why big block initiatives like XT, Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic failed. There was no consensus for a hard fork, any hard fork. The status quo remained, all while ETH market cap was making rapid gains on BTC and approaching it's zenith. This was when genuine enemies of bitcoin who really were trying to damage BTC however they could put on big blocker hats and started worrying people that BTC would be a myspace if it did not scale quickly. Haters from the r/buttcoin sub, those with a stake in seeing bitcoin fail, disciples of professor bitcorn, all manner of agent provocateurs all joined the fray *as big blockers*. It became impossible to separate friend from foe when they were both demanding precisely the same thing, a hard fork. That's when the banning started. False positives occurred and some of the earnest people got booted resulting in hurt feelings. The haters nurtured those feelings of resentment with talk about censorship and successfully cultivated a narrative that pits bitcoiner against bitcoiner. Divide the community, divide and conquer. It's a move directly out of the COINTELPRO (COunter INTELligence PROgram) play book used by Gov agencies aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic political organizations.
Not everyone who wanted BTC to hard fork was an enemy of Bitcoin, but EVERY actual enemy of Bitcoin wanted a hard fork. 
Then, when Segwit was finally ready Bitmain which had become quite powerful by exploiting covert ASIC boost to crush competition refused to give up the advantage they enjoyed without a fight. Push came to shove and eventually UASF was devised to end the miner blockade. That would have been humiliating to Jihan Wu, who then, -to save face (which is very important in the Chinese culture) hastily created ~~BCC~~ BCH, which also let him continue using Covert ASIC boost. The abortion of SW2X was also used, politically, to entrench the division and fortify the schism. It's all very frustrating for everyone on both sides and while I think r/btc is a cesspool of misinformation there are some sincere people there who share our goals and ethos. I don't know how or if we will ever get past the division with them but I miss the days when we were all one tribe despite our differences.

Yes and it's poorly written so misunderstanding your point is hard to avoid. 


Manticlops said fees would be better for everyone even if some do not follow the SF, you replied to him "HF would be the same". They are not the same. In a HF only those who follow the fork have any change. 


SF forces nothing on nobody. In this case full validation would be done by every node running Core, only ~1000 nodes in the whole world are not running core and at least some of those do not bother to validate their own transaction anyway, so, far, FAR less than 5% and to quote you, "who cares" about them.

Dude, OP's post is about the virtues and benefits of keeping blocks as small as possible from the standpoint of running a node. Your first comment here basically implies his 200 gb vs 2 tb storage comparison is inconsequential since a 2Tb drive is *so cheap*, and anyway "you don't need to RUN a full node in order to use bitcoin", implying *again* that smaller blocks are not so important.

Oh but I thought BCH is the real Bitcoin, its got a chain of digital signatures going back to the genesis block. Its got a 10 year history, not 2. The Aug 2017 fork air dropped BCH tokens to everyone with BTC 1 to 1 ensuring all the BTC adoption up to that point was evenly matched, BCH got an even start, may the best coin win, let the market decide and all that jazz.


This is nothing but jive, turkey. Right now the *evidence* indicates that the only relationship between block size and adoption is an *inverse* one. That's only counter intuitive to the members of the ~10℅ minority big block camp who (stupidly) assumed and (stubbornly) insisted that everyone else would share their "fees-over-security-and-decentralization" priorities. But as you said, at this point, this discussion is pointless.

BTM fees could be lower, yes. However there are additional costs beyond the ones you mentioned. Maintenance costs, vendor fees (ongoing % for some), exchange fees, banking fees, fees for footprint, for data, for electricity. Insurance. Administrative costs for compliance, for running a business, for transportation to service the machine cash float. Security costs. Opportunity costs for the capital parked in a box. At the end of the day its the cost of convenience to the pedestrian who wants an immediate on or off ramp without all the delay and hassle of uploading the equivalent of a  rectal ultrasound image to some strangers, and then funding or withdrawing from the exchange account. Providing cash to crypto on the spot is a tough service to provide for small operators and because there are so many newbs who need support it requires at least one full time person.

You made a hasty choice and now you're considering alternatives with regret. However, if you consider all the pros and cons of the choice you made you may find that you made a good choice without knowing it. Heres why;
Opportunity cost. When things are starting to go parabolic spot price can change 3,4,5% or more per day. For example look at the last ~~20 days~~ 2 weeks here, add up the change 
There's enormous investment and risk on the part of BTM operators, the service they offer is valuable. The premium they charge reflects this. Compared to setting up, and funding an account at, say, Coinbase, with all the kyc validation (hope your bank does not close your account), going from cash in hand to bitcoins in your pocket and vice versa, on the spot, with no delay, is a great alternative. And it might just save you money, if you're throttled to $1K per day while parabolic things are taking shape. 
As a bonus, you don't have all your kyc data residing with a honey pot of kyc data at an exchange, forever, with an exchange with questionable security on that data.

This is about the governance of (a) money - an optional and voluntary money. Potentially *the* money to change the world dramatically and for the better. If you want *masses, billions* of people to use it they must trust it, which means the bar for participation in governance of that money must be as low as possible. Otherwise those masses of people will gravitate towards another money system which does have lower barriers for participation in the governance of that money (and not towards money systems which have higher barriers for participation).

We're not digging holes, this is not and *nothing like* the brute force extraction of oil. 


So you want a HF to blocks bigger than 2MB? Is that it? So we don't get 4 years of debate again? Look, your problem is you're trying to apply what you know to something entirely unlike what you know. The internet did not scale by engineers laying .5 meter diameter copper cable. (so wake up).
It's great that ~2% of Americans are millionaires, the majority of humans live on about $3 a day. Increasing the costs of running a full node will not increase global decentralization. 1.57 million American millionaires are not going to run a full node if only blocks were bigger. 230 mining pools are not going to pop up in America if blocks get bigger. These numbers have no correlation with reality. 
If blocks were 10MB we could lose 90% of nodes, and increase capacity to ~50 TX/second, instead of ~5 TX/second (VISA does ~2000/second), and of course the HF to get us bigger blocks would split the chain which is not good for adoption. Implementing SW changes those figures but it's only a start. LN and many other optimizations could increase capacity far beyond 100,000 TX/second, without 2MB+ blocks, without hardforks, without diminishing decentralization, without splitting the chain. 
Don't confuse thinking smart with thinking small.

You "don't see any value" because you've got a massive failure of imagination. 
"You can do cold storage with Trezor".. yeah, for 5x the cost (nope no value there).
"You can still give someone your address in form of QR code"... as you can with an Opendime (nope no point there).
"I still doubt any Opendime would be opened soon as it destroys the device and so the loaded dime has higher value." Maybe. Maybe the recipient of a loaded opendime needs to add those bitcoins to some he's already got for a purchase of his own. Your lingering doubt is further evidence of imaginative failure.  
"Nobody can swap destination address nor amount".. What? How are you now suggesting those things can be done? I presume you've now read the FAQ I linked for you, with steps to prove to yourself the private keys are not produced by the manufacturer, so explain how destination address and or amount can be swapped, exactly, and realistically, (not some cockamamee conspiracy theory about the government coercing the manufacturer to build 100001 bogus devices each loaded with $10 worth of bitcoins and then act like some random guy making 10,000 x $10 purchases, in person (how long do you think that would take?), so the government can "successfully" counterfeit one million dollars worth of bitcoins -but only for as long as it takes for 1 in 10,000 people to want to add $10 to their online balance or get change for a $2 coffee. 
And lastly, yes, a Trezor is "reusable - no need to break it". On the other hand, a Trezor does on chain transactions and the present (and especially the future) blockchain forensic methods are not to be dismissed. Nor is it hard to find and seize a Trezor during, say, an airport search. If you had to sweep the coins and ditch the device to cross a border it's a lot more expensive to replace a Trezor. Likewise, a one time use paper wallet is nice and cheap but nobody with any sense would accept a paper wallet for an off chain transaction where the previous owner of the wallet could see the private keys. Trezors are great but Opendimes represent solutions to problems you've probably never considered.

So with that being your apparent preference it makes perfect sense for you to sell your bitcoins rather than lobby miners to disarm BIP148.

You've got this exactly backwards.
UASF BIP148 will only result in a chain split **IF** the miners continue to reject the best scaling solution from the best developers.
Meanwhile  Segwit2x will **absolutely** result in chain split (and chaos) when the HF part happens, because just like with ETH/ETC some people will never (ever) surrender their values (and they should not).

NO. Running nodes is not about generously and altruistically supporting the network by contributing resources. It never has been. That's a crucial and fundamental misconception that most big blockers have. Running a node is really about not delegating the  right or responsibility of parameter changes to others. It's about trustlessness.     
It sounds as though you are arguing that since some people cannot afford to participate in consensus building by running nodes we might as well go with bigger block sizes, which increases bandwidth and storage even further and prices even more people out of the participation. 
Well, the world has had a choice for over a year. Big blocks or small blocks. It looks like your expectations and assumptions were wrong. At what point do you recognize the folly of your choice?

UASF'ers do not want a chain split. UASF is not "aiming" or *trying* to cause a chain split. However, UASF supporters are prepared to *endure* a chain split, to get SW activated, with no HF bullshit as a condition. The ball is in the miners court.

You see, slow-bro, years ago big blockers like you were screaming, literally screaming, about how Bitcoin needed to hard-fork (without delay!) to make blocks bigger - absolutely HAD to, or else some other alt coin was going to eclipse Bitcoin as the  crypto. You were all so sure it was going to happen. After BIP 100 &amp; 101 failed to get any traction big blockers like you started scoffing at Segwit, calling it vaporware. Until the concept was finally coded and tested. Then you big blockers all started saying Segwit would *never* activate, you guys claimed that for a whole year. But then Segwit activated, so you big blockers started saying Segwit was terrible and nobody would *ever* use it. Today ~40% of all bitcoin tx use Segwit. But even before SW hit 25% usage big blockers like you pivoted to saying Lightning Network was vaporware. You guys kept calling it that until LN implementations were available for download. By then big blockers like you were predictably saying LN would *never* work, except it does. So then you began saying nobody would *ever* use it, but we are. Now here you are today saying "It will never scale in a decentralized way". Well, we've been here before. Bigblockers like you are known for being boys who cried wolf. Big blocker predictions about Bitcoin have been so **consistently** wrong that your credibility is not just low - it's negative! **The best indicator right now that LN will scale in a decentralized way is that you big blockers say it won't.**
Tell me I didn't waste my time.

Your bank does not charge you for having a checking bank account because you've kept a minimum balance in it (so they can lend it out using the fractional reserve system). You've probably kept ~$100 in your account for the last 10 years (since 2008). The buying power of that $100 has slipped by ~30% in that time (3%/year). Meanwhile, the buying power of the $100 I decided to store in Bitcoin since bitcoins were worth $5.00 (late 2011), offers me $72,106 worth of buying power. 
I think you're just mad.

Consumers have rights as well. Federally regulated businesses must abide by anti-discrimination laws and anti-competition laws. In Canada the Financial Consumer Agency requires such institutions to provide a complaint handling process where the grounds for refusal of service can be examined for fair and consistent application of decision criteria, and refusal of service can be challenged. In cases where such refusal of service constitutes anti-competitive behavior a tribunal has the jurisdiction to "order one or more suppliers of the product in the market [to] accept the person as a customer..." I'd encourage OP to look into similar consumer protection in the US.

UASF supporters are just running the (backward compatible) software they want to run, as is their right. 
BIP 148 only enforces the upgrade which the overwhelming majority of nodes and businesses have said they want as well. 
Any potential chain split could be averted by miners, most of whom now seem to be OK with SW anyway. 
 
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:17:39
NO. Miner split the chain. Any split is on them. They have a clear mandate from the economic and technical majority to activate Segwit. Miners can use BIP141 to diffuse any potential chain split.

No, but possibly I'm uninformed. I've used bitcoins for years but never touched USDT, it's irrelevant to me and I've never given it any attention. It's just another trading pair. If there is no new problem with bitcoin, but some altcoin, or even a thousand other altcoins collapse, why would that make the price of bitcoin go anywhere by up as people trade out of the dying altcoin(s), much less cause a dramatic drop down for BTC?

Do you even bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:29:04


There are various use cases, such as cold storage. If you are going to accept bitcoins from someone in a face to face exchange and want the transaction "off chain" you can present your own empty opendime, **which you initialized**, and have the counter party load the stick (which produces the plausible deniability that the stick changed hands many times before coming to yours). 
You might also want to read the [FAQ]( where they detail the process you can use to actually prove to yourself that the manufacturer cannot know the private key. It's second from the bottom on that page. 
As for your scenario with duplicate public keys (which again, are generated by initial owners, not at the factory), I repeat, as soon as the first one is used the rest would show zero balance, probably before MOST of the bogus sticks could be distributed, it's a foolish plot. Even if "*most*" people won't redeem the keys (because they plan to exchange the dime unsealed) the degree of success would hinge on how soon the first one was used. It's worse (and more costly) than counterfeiting bills, as soon as the first one is detected (or in this case *used*) all the rest are worthless.

@_date: 2017-06-22 21:22:45
Crying ad hominem won't make you more imaginative or seem more intelligent.


Yes HW wallets like Trezor can do many things Opendimes cannot, nobody is saying they are technologically equvalent. Your response fails to acknowledge the only point being made in this portion of the discussion, that it does cold storage at a fraction of the cost. 


Less expensive than WHAT? What was your point here? Did you imagine the public address on an Opendime is engraved on the outside?  You said "You can still give someone your address in form of QR code" to which I replied you do the exact same with Opendimes, once initialized it provides an address and QR code you can print or email or whatever, now your rebuttal is "Paper/image on screen is less expensive, that's the point". WTF are you trying to say, besides displaying how little you know about the thing? 


It's trivial to note the address at inital setup. If that changes when the stick is used in different computers you know one of the computers is compromised. Of course you don't need to insert the stick in computers later to load it, you can send (or have sent) transactions to the address you noted during setup. The stick itself is read only after being initialized, it can't be compromised that way itself. You DID read the FAQ, right?


Wait... Where did I claim that Opendime should not be initialized when bought? Better yet, how would that preclude off-chain transactions? I merely presented a solution to your utterly improbable conspiracy theory that Coinkite might start passing around mass produced opendimes preloaded with bitcoins but with private keys they controled so they could sabotage thier own business.  What I said was (with italics on those parts specifically for your weirdness) "If **you** are going to accept bitcoins from someone in a face to face exchange and want the transaction "off chain" **you** can present your own **empty** opendime, which **you** initialized, and have the counter party load the stick." Now... I'm not surprised you've been wrong many times, your reading comprehension seems a little weak, or mabey you just skim what you read and shoot from the hip, what surprises me is that you've come to the realization that you were previously wrong (many times even). I imagine it's hard to overcome a learning disablility when you have a learning disability. It's like when you are dead, you do not know you are dead, it's only difficult for the people around you. Same thing when you are stupid. 


Way ahead of you. That's why **I told you** "to sweep the coins and ditch the device to cross a border". Oh but "it's easy to simply not have it. Or have empty one. If you are so paranoid, you should memorise the seed anyway" which I guess renders Trezors and Opendimes equally useless for this purpose. Oh wait! That's right! My point here was that "**If you had to sweep the coins and ditch the device** to cross a border **it's a lot more expensive to replace a Trezor**."


That's the point, it's a feature, not a bug. That's also why a $100 Trezor is not suitable for passing around like cash for off chain transactions. I suspect you still don't actually get this point yet so I'll say it again; Opendimes are cheap disposable bitcoin bearer bonds in whatever amount of bitcoins the user needs.   


Well that covers all imaginable scenarios so I guess you win. Wait.. what if I'm buying polically sensitive pokemon cards from an arms dealer or stumble upon some rare art at a russian wife auction? Should I just hand over my Trezor to keep everything off chain? Oh right Trezors have that authentication mechanisim, they couldn't spend the bitcoins even if I gave them the device. If only there were a solution.


You realize everyone, everywhere has been accepting off-chain transactions everyday for everything, forever, right? They've been doing that with far less ability to verify the kind and quality of information available with an opendime.       
 


Is it the solutions which are broken, or your understanding of the problems being solved? 
Actually, don't bother answering any of these questions. I feel like you're just trolling me, so I'll not waste any more time on you.

You helpfully provide exactly that:

That might not be a super majority or fit your definition of a mandate, but it's a strong majority.

The vast majority of Core devs eschew discussing the politics, probably because of the politics that are created by their participation.
Ethereum's legacy is it's own thing, but yes, very much a lesson for study for everyone concerned about the hazards of HF's. Again, miners can avert a HF by activating Segwit like they said they would.       
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:19:19


You mean BIP 141? The simple SF that's been ready for 9 months? The on-chain capacity upgrade we need, but which has been spurned by most of the hashing power because low capacity = higher fees? How do you not blame miners?? What do you blame Core for, except taking longer than expected to thoroughly test SW before delivering.. oh and for setting activation consensus to 95%, which the miners now use to exploit the rest of the ecosystem for their own gains.
 


Why. Why do "we need a HF"? Exactly and precisely why? For "more capacity"? How *much* more (after SW) and how soon? Lay out the math for us. You see, what we need is data. Data to tell us IF a HF is actually needed **immediately** after more than doubling the through-put, and then, and only then are we able to discuss how big blocks need to be, with consideration to other optimizations and the well known and widely discussed downsides and drawbacks of a HF to increase the bock size. 


Delivering code for a HF would not magically create consensus, if they had such power we'd all be running SW already. The reason no HF initiatives we've seen in the past have actually produced a HF is because all of them would fail to create consensus and ultimately produce a chain split. 100%. Guaranteed. That includes segwit2x. BIP148 *could* cause a chain split and if miners continue to reject the safest scaling solution from the most competent dev team there *will* be a chain split, but at least SW will finally activate and then we can start gathering data.

Yes, and it's dumb. 
*the manufacturer does not set the private keys, as you imagine in point 1, but rather the initial owner contributes a source of entropy to generate the private key.
* If all 100001 identical dimes have the same public key (So the amount shows up on each) then the balance on all 100001 opendimes goes to 0 as soon as the first one is used, probably before distribution is done. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:11:08
Scaling concerns are less about hard drives than bandwidth. I'm glad to hear you're a node operator, I am as well, we have that in common. Even so, you and I don't have consensus on what the best scaling solution is or who's to blame for the lack of progress. I think the contention you dismiss as propaganda is very real. I object to 2MB and I think 8MB is insane, (especially before we have data from SW) and I'd take this position even if there were a way to provide 2 or 8MB *without a chain split*, which there is not.. 
Why? Because the most critical aspect of Bitcoin is **decentralization**. It trumps every other concern. I care about confirmation times, I care about capacity, I care about security, maintaining first mover advantage and every other issue as well. But decentralization it what sets Bitcoin apart from legacy and competing systems.

Is the refusal of service based on a policy of not servicing any business which buys computers, or just computers used in this fledgling field of fintech?
