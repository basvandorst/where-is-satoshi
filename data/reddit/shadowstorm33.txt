You have to sell the stock first. You also cannot exchange  "gold" for real gold. Same deal.

I have stopped using coinbase to buy ( fees) and now buy exclusively from robinhood (no fees) 
I'm trying to understand why anybody would use coinbase?

What do you mean not real bitcoin?

Robinhood is FREE

You're right- bad example with etrade. You don't have to sell technically but why would you use anything but Robinhood? It's like the equivalent of putting money under your mattress because you don't trust banks.

Can you withdraw stocks from etrade?

It's still a great investment. They are easily 7-10 years ahead of everyone else in multiple billion dollar businesses. Cars, semis, energy storage, roofing the list goes on and on.

Robinhood. There are 0 fees.

"Set to" is an interesting choice of words.  Where I would argue is that the supercharger network has taken a decade to get to where it is now.  Over 13,000 chargers on the last report.  VW's electricy america program has 158.  That's 158 total, worldwide.  And this program by the way was built because of a settlement for lying about emissions.  No thanks - I"ll stick with the Great american company - Tesla for the win.
