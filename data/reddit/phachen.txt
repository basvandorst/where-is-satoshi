You honestly expect someone to do this for free? 
How do you know PHP, but you arent able to make a bot yourself? Your idea is extremely simple...

This is seriously the most retarded thing I've read in a while. Institutional money is known as "smart money" for a very good reason.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:48:52
You said that institutional money isn't in bitcoin because it cant be, but now you are saying that BTC doesn't need it, which are quite different from each other.
Institutional money is already controlling bitcoin price action, the institutional order flow is easy to spot if you have experience with this trading style.

This is a hypothetical situation that will never happen. Do you even realize how fucking hard the price would pump if someone tried to buy "all" of it? Lol.


That doesn't even mean anything "haha"
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:21:37
Actually I did read all of it and it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about, also your reading comprehension needs some work. 
You think institutional money owns nothing but "false profits"... Okay buddy. 
Does downvoting me make you feel better? It's always funny to see someone downvoting someome else for having a different opinion, I think you take Reddit a little too seriously.

Does this mean bitcoin will be faster than ethereum? I think ethereum is still gonna be faster, thoughts?

I'm sorry but what a stupid post lol
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:55:46
You are trying to prove that Bitcoin is valuable by calling diamonds worthless. They are two COMPLETELY different things.
Sorry for calling your post stupid tho.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:27:09
good point? he was very wrong...
does no one understand market cap?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:53:31
Exactly what I was thinking. Look through his post history if you're bored, its pretty amusing lol
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:33:31
Thanks man. I really did try my best to help him despite his complete lack of fundamental knowledge. I am starting to think he is a liar and just trolling everyone for fun.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:12:10
You're a liar, its that simple. If you had bought bitcoin in 2013, and you can't figure this out without posting on reddit, there is something seriously wrong.
Plus, you're an asshole who ignores people when they try to help you.
I PM'd you and offered you genuine advice and you just asked me stupid fucking questions, but I still tried to genuinely help you, and you decide to suddenly ignore me without so much as a thank you.
That was extremely rude of you. Thanks for ruining my motivation to help clueless noobs like you.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:55:04
cause you're full of shit and its really fucked up that you constantly ask these types of questions, and waste the peoples time who legitimately try to help you out
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:46:06
you're such a fucking asshole its unbelievable. why do you do this to people who offer to help you?
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:07:42
Haha if it was so helpful then why did you start ignoring me, and never saying thank you? 
I was nothing but nice to you at first, but you didn't give a shit.
I am still honestly convinced that you're trolling. I don't believe its actually possible for anyone to be as clueless and dumb as you.
You dump money into the peak of every pump and dump, and then cry when the price dumps. You tell me "I actually want to make a compilation video of it" because you're so convinced the universe is acting against you. 
Then you tell me "I figured out why, I was just putting too much money in. I've tried putting in less money and the price is going up."
I tried to explain that you're money would not likely have any influence on the price so it was merely a coincidence, but I don't think you believed me back then or now.
I honestly have never met someone with such a huge lack of basics/fundamentals of how stuff works. You have the brain of my dead dog when it comes to figuring things out on your own using a logical thought process, so you just expect everyone to spoonfeed you what you want.
Its honestly pathetic. I highly HIGHLY recommend that if anyone ever messages you privately to try to help you gain an understanding of something, you act appreciative and make it your top priority to learn from them and act like you actually care someone is trying to help you. If you had done that, this wouldn't be happening right now, and you would likely have the knowledge to actually make some good moves in this market.
Have fun continuously failing you jackass. If you are so rich like you say, do yourself a favor and pick up some courses at a community college with low expectations. If you're not gonna do that, then just leave your bitcoins and don't touch them because you're only going to lose money. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:22:26
It's funny cause you call me an asshole but you go around telling me I have mental issues.
Sounds like you're the triggered one....
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:49:53
This post is obviously fake, and I was not being serious. 
Who knows whether its a small chance or a big chance, there is a chance but you dont know how big it is.
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:02:15
You explicitly said "although small", so I am just wondering why do you think its small as opposed to large or any other metric.
I already proved you wrong, damn kid?!
@_date: 2017-05-01 04:56:13
Could you please explain why you believe there is a small chance it won't be worth anything?
