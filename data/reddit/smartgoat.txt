The pump and dumpers are working hard today, eh?

It's hard to go against Satoshi's wishes. How sure are you that Bitcoin has better chances by keeping the artificial limit? Is there something regarding block size Satoshi wasn't aware of?

That's just a first world inconvenience. Sure Bitcoin solves that too. But people from third world countries have much worse problems like, you know, their savings being stolen in real time through inflation, and not being able to leave the country unless they leave their savings behind. Remember the message Satoshi wrote in the genesis block.

In cold storage your coins are safe. In Coinbase, not only are they not safe (from seizure, for instance), but also should a fork happen, you will probably only get the coins from one fork, and not the other (or none, if Coinbase shuts down). With cold storage you will have your coins in both forks.

That doesn't make any sense.

is this where you got your numbers from all this time? Do you think nodes that don't accept inbound connections should be counted or not?
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:52:01
Correct. And you can get the public key from the private key.

Nice try, Andreas.

After everything we got for free from them, you shouldn't make such accusations without more solid evidence.
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:48:17
I stand corrected. Edited.

The guy is so crazy I don't even want to talk about him and his silly exchange. I had enough when I read his rant about why he must charge a 30 BTC entrance fee.
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:22:18
Correct, thanks.

The point is they exist and are hidden, but you need to know about them or you might lose money (eg: paper wallets). But I agree, there's nothing special about them other than that.
