See for the existing exchanges and services here. LocalBitcoins is the easiest way to sell. If you plan to be in Pattaya and can't find a trader, I'd buy some from you.

Sure. See many, many cypherpunks discussions starting early 90's/
'You are your key' was a common meme.
It didn't happen because pgp required a bit of effort to learn about and people didn't value their privacy.
Things are different now, and I think bitcoin might eventually be the push that's needed to get it done finally.

It's bloody obvious that it's easier to use numbers greater than one for the digit part of any price quote. But that has an easy solution by using the units mbtc, ubtc, millies, micros etc.
This argument keeps raging on simply because some want the (confusing) word 'bits' instead of the (less confusing) 'micros'. The latter fits in well with the engineering units used in the SI system (and allows 'millies' as well).

2) cheaper than a trezor
1) smartphone only
2) nfc only
3) requires trust in your phone. password and transaction details are entered and confirmed on the phone.

When you're left with a count of 1 tho, this isn't necessarily the actual key/value is it? All you know is there is one more tx with that key in the IBLT you received than you had in yours.
So you assume it's the actual tx and see if everything works at the end? I guess that can make sense if the probabilities are good enough.

'doesn't work' is kinda misleading.
It does work with stable wallets if you mean you can restore your balance to them in case you lose your trezor.
It does work with any wallet if you mean you can transfer value to them.
it doesn't yet work interactively with any stable wallet except the web wallet provided by mytrezor.com.

one syllable? ok, use 'mike' then. 
One currency that uses SI units is bitcoin ...  mBTC, uBTC. People often say things like $2k as well. But this is a red herring; the issue is the use of the confusing unit name  'bits' when all you mean is a microbitcoin (or a micro, or a mike, i don't care).

Oh, it will happen alright.
I would expect when to depend mainly on popularity tho. It won't matter if there is an index or a gallery, or whether there's any content on the site. Sooner or later there will be someone who sees something they object to and make a complaint giving the url. It's kinda hard to prove, so it might take a few such complaints. 
I'm thinking there might be ways to make money with this by using a url that can change, yet still be findable by customers. Say a namecoin id, a torrent, or ... a blockchain entry! Ta da. :)

Definitely play first.
But then just buy a trezor, keep an offsite backup of the seed and send the majority of your coins to it (either mytrezor.com or a wallet that supports it). The trezor takes most of the fear and complication out of all this.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:53:31

I think streamium is magic, but don't expect to have more than a few guys watching at once unless you have a huge upload bandwidth. It won't  be like a web site chat room at all. At the moment it would work to mention your stream name in a web site chat, but in future they will be looking for that.
That will get fixed in future...they're already looking at ways to handle it.

nitpick: bitcoin addresses are (double) hashes of a public key, not a private key.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:24:55
Ahh, I remember those things. Nick's paper was essentially proving the existence of a nonzero level of cognitive cost which noone would deny. All the older schemes mentioned used pretty old crypto and so were pretty clunky.
In the context of streamium, I don't think you could get away with arguing that the cognitive load was so high it wouldn't work. Even for the (higher load) cases like article payment it seems there are more modern designs that are working quoted in your reference. 
I guess I'd agree that there will be some cases where micropayments won't work until we get better AI to help us make all those little decisions, but streamium is far from that kind of a case.
@_date: 2015-05-24 12:04:52
bitcoin removed the payment account shutdown and chargeback problems.
micropayments  removed the 'chunky trade' problem where the broadcaster didn't trust the viewer to pay at the end and vice-versa.
something like openbazaar could remove the rendezvous site shutdown problem (after a complaint or two to LEA, for example)
The last issue I think is the bandwidth problem. Each broadcaster has to provide upload bandwidth for EACH viewer, so the average home broadcaster will max out with only a few viewers.
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:22:05

The statistic comes from a coinometric statement (5 months ago, btw) that there are only 250000 bitcoin addresses with over 1BTC in them. Hard to get from there to number of users of Bitcoin given that many users buy what they need to spend, and change addresses fragment what they have.

same thing happened to me. They don't indicate what's happened to the coins in the transaction log so I asked. They restored them (even tho I didn't want them for use at the time). That took a few 10's of minutes.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:32:28

Good to see this finally happening tho. Good work!
@_date: 2015-05-22 01:16:55
1) yes
2) you make an offsite backup of the 24 word mnemonic seed
3) you can't. but both are extremely improbable. If you disagree, you have far bigger problems.
4) your trezor doesn't hold coins, just the keys. So you can easily send to the corresponding blockchain addresses. Sending from them requires the key, so the trezor (or a wallet with your seed imported) is necessary
5) tbh, i'm not sure. It would need to be plugged into a usb port with a compatible wallet (or mytrezor.com web page i guess) ready. I suspect nothing happens until the pin is entered - can't test mine without uninstalling stuff. 
6) look up ledger. i have no experience with it tho.

edit: This shows he agreed to the sale of the coins on his laptop early 2014:  I was recalling this.
The silk road coins were in an escrow wallet;  it's entirely possible access to that was available to other staff there, or maybe it wasn't even encrypted (tho that sounds unlikely to me).

groan. if you'd said that was what you were thinking of right at the start this discussion would have taken a completely different tack.
I assume you mean a subscription model. I'd argue that what you're now talking about involves way too much trust, too much effort for users to set up and that's why it hasn't gaine that much traction. It's got as much as it has because it's the only option (and those sites just love having your full subscription that you eventually forget about). It's barely even a micropayment system since you're not micropaying - the site is just counting down your preloaded time.
Streamium is clearly superior in all respects

Each exchange had it's own high as you can see by just looking at the current prices on exchanges. So there is NOT just one answer.
Mtgox went unstable for some time before it failed completely, and the price went over $1200 there. At that time other exchanges had more 'normal' prices. I recall Bitfinex was at $1167 for example. Others were more in line with the finex price.
So, to answer your question, I'd say the ATH was about $1167.

I was around back then, even on usenet before the cypherpunk mailing list started. I was a crypto 'hobbyist', i participated in several of the digital money projects as they happened.
The projects were all squashed by governments asap usually on money laundering or counterfeiting grounds. The lesson learnt was that no centralized way of doing it would work. A decentralized version was needed but noone could figure out how to get that to work - it didn't provide a profit immediately and no incentives to make it survive long enough could be seen.
Then everything went quiet in the early 2000's. People were just tired of this brick wall I think. Me too, so I lost track of them until 2012/2013 whe I had free time on my hands and went to see waht was going on. I suddenly realized this was THE one and I'd missed the startup. :(
Satoshi's flash of brilliance was that the incentive to self-secure could be handled by the currency itself. Further, he aligned all the incentives - no mean feat by itself. It was interesting to see that even the people who had tried to make a digital cash before were not convinced (except Hal). Adam Back and Austin Hill took 5 years or so to come on board. People like Zooko and Bram Cohen even longer. So few of those guys are involved even now (tho maybe they're just too old).
It was not an obvious way to do it, yet nothing else looked possible. Satoshi's genius was (as you say) in following up his flash of insight with years of work. Just like Einstein did. History gets rewritten very easily (and I wasn't around to see this!) so although Einstein is a household word synonymous with genius, the truth is he was a guy with several flashes followed by hard work like Satoshi. Much of his life was fruitless - did you know he was considered to be irrelevant by most physicists from about 1935 onwards? The comparison with Satoshi becomes even stronger...

so...expected price at 'some time' = 
.2 * 0$ + .3 * 100000$(approx.) + .5 * 1000000$ = 530000$
530k$ 'some time' sounds like a decent buy today at under 1k$. :)

There are 'wicks' on those candles. 
The top of the top wick is the highest price reached in the bar's one hour, the bottom of the bottom wick is the lowest price reached in that hour.
The top of the actual solid bar is the entry/exit price for that hour and the bottom of the solid bar is the other entry/exit price. The color of the bar tells you if the exit price was less than entry price (red) or the exit price was greater than the entry price (green).
Candles at the bottom of the page show the volume traded in that hour.

Honestly I have trouble remembering some.
Zooko's was called mojonation - a toy project. Fun for a bit.
There was 'ecash' - a version of digicash. I put money in. Run thru Mark Twain bank in Saint Louis,MO (and other banks throughout the world). Lost that cash. 
There was e-gold, of course.

The idea was first voiced by Hal Finney. Dunno if the quote here is wrongly attributed or if Satoshi reworded Hal's comment later.
And just to clear up the meaning, Hal was saying that the expected return was positive, taking into account all scenarios related to bitcoin's price.

infiltration is unnecessary I think. All they need to do is control the controllers. I'm sure they're already amassing the data required for that coercion.
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:26:13
You're right. 
But 5 days before, Hal said:
"So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about..."

Business had to be dragged kicking and screaming, almost shamed, into using web pages.
Email's future was obvious to all of us who knew about it back then, and business profiting from it had nothing to do with adoption until at least half way up the adoption curve (sorry, no ref stats for that statement). It started in universities, bulletin boards, then public corporations, hospitals for internal use. Business profits came later.
The feeling is the same now with bitcoin. It will be a real push until the s-curve really starts to move.

what i said. localbitcoins or mycelium trader the first time if that's even necessary. Less hoops than any exchange there.
It seems you're getting me. I'm saying they can just collect some btc on a simple phone wallet from the first client who has them, and keep them to use on backpage as required. Buy from lb or mt if an urgent first supply of bitcoin is needed.

I don't see the issues here. Coinbase is a bad choice for obvious reasons when a simple phone wallet will do the job. It just means getting even one client to send bitcoin to your phone wallet and you've got enough to pay for backpage ads for ages.
If that one client is hard to find, maybe a one-time purchase of btc via localbitcoins, mycelium, etc is sensible.

It's a form of a very old attack known as TEMPEST. Hard to stop, but can be mitigated by using crypto code that's designed to not leak info. Relevant to bitcoin coz the private keys may be leaked during signing.

That equation is not a model. It's a basic law of imcompressible fluids. What you mean is a model built with that at it's heart, and as i said i can believe models with additions might fail at high velocities. But that equation does not fail.

I'm not sure, but I think I recall that they did consider this in writing their code for the trezor. So you might be correct that it's relatively immune, but no device is completely immune.
@_date: 2015-07-03 07:43:37
People always seem to want to complicate this simple procedure.
They should consider just holding bitcoin now that volatility is low, and now that it's the only way to buy backpage ads. There's simply no need to go get an exchange account, or even sign up at coinbase etc.

yup. A password you 'write' on every glass you touch, every tap you use in public places, every shop counter you lean on doesn't sound real secure. But it gets worse. This 'password' is a one time thing like all biometrics. If someone gets it,you're fkd forever.

Bitcoin has something even better ... micropayments. Something along the line of a commit transaction at the start of the ride, small payments thru a channel per minute, or per kilometer, and stops at the end of the ride. Streamium is a currently working example of this.

it's my attempt to explain the basic nature of the equation by analogy. i think it's a pretty close one.
Economists have a way of leaving logic behind (maybe for reasons of practicality, computability, etc) so I'm guessing they don't see it the way it was originally 'discovered'. It's such a basic thing tho, and in the basic form with the assumptions I've stated, it's not worried by almost infinite velocities :)

That equation is a simple statement that the money volume moving per unit time in the economy is the same in the two views represented by the two sides. It's as basic as ~~avogadro's law~~ the continuity equation and only assumes that money is not created or destroyed.
I guess you can handle the creation of xbt by making M a function of time, like they must do with fiat.
So it applies ... always.
I don't see any reason why the quantities should have any different interpretation than the ones given by standard macroeconomics.

@_date: 2015-07-23 01:48:52
making a payment that can be clawed back for 60 days is very much like a zero conf payment, or low conf at least.
Streamium handles that wait you talk about. It's obviously a risk that uber would be willing to accept for the business.

You're looking for an assurance contract. Once the funding level is reached the contract pays the web service automatically. Centralized versions (crowd funding) exist. Guessing here, but maybe lighthouse is in the right direction, or maybe there's even a way to script a transaction to do it directly - would a simple multisig work for you?
Does the website accept bitcoin directly? If not, you'd probably need an intermediary.
How you split the login is up to you :)

It doesn't matter (theoretically) how fast the fluid moves thru the pipes. You still get the same volume out at the end.
In practice I'm sure the macroeconomic models add a whole lot of extra stuff to that equation and maybe some of those break with high velocities, but that's a different question.
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:33:45

@_date: 2015-07-01 23:16:57
Sounds like a payment channel would be a better idea to me. The rate is confirmed, a large enough commitment is locked in, then the channel is opened as soon as the ride starts, charges by time or mile, ends at the end of the trip where the payment and 'change' is executed. Uber's commission might be harder to work in, but I'm sure they could figure that out :)
@_date: 2016-02-21 12:08:56
I see you're confirmed, but it took 6 hours. :(
I guess it was the low fee that caused that (which you say you couldn't set), so I suggest a better wallet.

The person who sends it to you knows the bitcoin address you used for that transaction and he/she can trace it in the blockchain. Noone else knows who  that address belongs to. If you do as I recommended and use a wallet on your phone, it will present every client with a different address.
If you transfer to cash via a face to face meeting, then noone except the trader knows anything, and he only sees your face and of course knows the address you sent to him from. These meetings are safe if you use a public place.
You can sell your coins more conveniently by (say) a transfer to localbitcoins.com where the buyer will use a bank transfer back to you. That's still safe but the trader now knows your name and bank account info, and law enforcement might one day hit localbitcoins with a warrant for your account info if they had a reason to investigate - pretty unlikely.
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:02:21
It's a bot that sends the tip to changetip, where they will wait for you to log in and create a wallet. It times out eventually (weeks i think) and it's as if the tip never happened, so you don't need to do anything to deny them.
You'd be silly to not collect them though. At the least you can keep them on changetip if the traceability really worries you (the wallet there isn't associated with the blockchain). Then you can use them to tip others for excellent advice etc. :)
edit: i had a second thought about the traceability, I don't think there's any risk of that at all. The When you send from the changetip wallet to your phone, it would be coming from the changetip hotwallet...nothing related to you.
The privacy risk at changetip is there tho. It's when you 'connect' your various social accounts to be able to tip on them (twitter, facebook, reddit, etc...). Just stick with reddit and there's no leak.

Strangely complicated to work this arithmetic out so people make mistakes.

@_date: 2015-04-09 14:07:46
Ahh, you meant bits, not 'bits'? 
In that case you meant 100,000,000 bits where each bit is called a satoshi.
Not sure what you mean by 'divisible by 8 SI units' tho. Divisible into 10^8 units is correct (that's 100,000,000 satoshis).
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:56:03
The hardest part is the btc to fiat conversion at the receiving end, so unless you have a market maker there, you'd end up using the existing systems like rebit.ph.
Depending where you are, I'm guessing there are still opportunities at the sending end, but again, you might end up competing with existing companies (like rebit's parent co which opened offices in hong kong, thailand, etc.). 
@_date: 2015-04-04 05:20:13
It is. And it can get way worse than that, but you can learn as you go. I'd do it in stages, depending on your risk and comfort levels.
Stage 1): simply install a wallet (mycelium is good) on your phone and use it to receive bitcoin. Password your phone and wallet so your coworkers can't steal your coins. Keep reading about bitcoin...
When you're getting uncomfortable about having much money on your phone, move to: 
Stage 2) Install a wallet you like on your home computer, and each day, send the phone coins to the computer wallet. Read about bitcoin ...
At this stage (I'm assuming you still have most payments in cash so you're not needing to sell bitcoin), you've read enough to know you have a new 'bank' account, so it's worth just keeping them there for a rainy day. When that day arrives, try the myceliuum or localbitcoins.com traders to sell some bitcoin. Read more about bitcoin ...
At some point in the above, you will start to see the security issues. So, when you understand this stuff (and you have enough to worry about): 
Stage 3) The biggest risk is that your computer is infected and your coins taken. The best (and easiest) way to handle that is to invest in a hardware wallet (I like trezor, but there are cheaper ones). 
Some dork who knows you have a lot of money in bitcoin and knows where you live may force you to send him/her your bitcoin. First level of defense there is to just keep quiet about how much you have, like you would if you were hiding cash under the mattress. Another defense is to use a fake wallet etc., but read more :)
Also you will read that bitcoin can be tracked. The guy who paid you knows the bitcoin address he sent to on your phone. By looking on the blockchain, he will see you move it to your home wallet, but by this time you will be using a new address for each of those moves, so he doesn't know the actual balance you have. This tracking ends when you sell face-to-face with a trader from mycelium or localbitcoins.com, or if you send the coins thru a tumbler of some sort. Read more for that ...

my 'recommendation' was to send from phone to computer each day (or immediately if she wants). it's been lost in the forest of comments now tho.
She works in a club, so I doubt if the client is the worry. The phone is more likely to get stolen by coworkers, I bet.

Search "sybil attack" for the best ideas, but basically this is a hard problem. You might make it expensive to register (a deposit won't work), or difficult (like bitcoin's proof of work), but those still allow people with the resources to make multiple accounts.
Probably your best approach is to make it unnecessary to defend against it, if possible.

Lolz. I'm sure my artistic skills would just detract from my detailed and compelling analysis of the market.

I use mplayer like that.

Since you're in thailand I would have expected to be able to get a shipping estimate to me in thailand. It didn't work. 
Just one point :)

and xbt price rises. lol

you'd be right if by 'nobody' you mean the USA. Everyone else already does use the metric system.
Millies and micros were pretty much the decided units tho some wanted to call micros 'bits'

I made the post because it's happened to me twice in the last couple of months. Not sure why I got downvoted actually.
@_date: 2015-02-20 01:50:30
you meant i guess :)
And there's no link to the cnn site.

yep. best to leave the bitcoin payment button and just don't respond when people send to it. 100% profit!

You've described 2 properties of each bar (above/below, red/green), but the WTF? also distinguishes between bars to the left and right sides of the current price (says the ones to the left are bids and the ones to the right are asks). That's 8 bar types to describe.
For example what does a green bar above the axis wayyyy over to the right side mean? It could be bids added (ignoring the sidedness), or it could be asks removed (ignoring the above/below property), or it could be asks added (ignoring the color), but it CAN'T be case (a) above and also be asks (since it's on the right side as stated in the WTF?)

It seems everyone's confused there too. Pretty strange considering I see green bars like that most times I look at the live chart.

Otoh, that computing power could easily be redirected to any blockchain-type currency if the bitcoin mining rewards became unprofitable.

I asked the question exactly because i do see green bars above the line on the right of any current prices occasionally.
edit: And yes, I asked here because the WTF? linked me to this comment, so I figured 'here' ought to contain a full explanation :)

i talked with comboy on irc. He was a bit 'tired', but thought this bar was a bug. It should not happen, just like a red bar wayyyy to the left above the axis should not happen. He said he will fix it and get back to me.

Simple. We need a Tachyon Control Protocol/IP

i just saw a mythical beast on your screenshot! :)
And here's another one: 
Here you see a positive green bar wayyyy over on the right. The high price is well below this, so the price changes are not the issue. It was unnecessary, but I even reduced the slice thickness to 1 min to make sure of that.
