I still do not fully understand it.
Say I am a new user and am using a mobile wallet.  I go to the grocery store that accepts bitcoins.  Will I have to set up a lightning network, or will the mobile wallet already have this all figured out in the background?  
Does this differ if it is a small retailer or a large retailer?  Who has the burden of implementing a lightning network?

You should consider opening a separate account at your current bank just for crypto purchasing, and linking that new account to coinbase circle etc.
This way the company does not have access to all of your money, but only the amount you put into the specific bank account.  
This is only worth while if you have a substantial amount of money, as the bank account will probably come with a fee.   The joys of banking...

It won't take a failure of bitcoin for other cryptos to be prevalent, usable, and important.  
What is more decentralized, a single cryptocurrency, or multiple cryptocurrencies?  you decide...
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:42:06
Yes.  Altcoins are key to a decentralized cryptocurrency future.  Enter Litecoin

Starbucks still receives the same amount of money, so using fiat money does not make Starbucks richer.  The discount comes (I believe) from Fold purchasing giftcards at a discount.  Unless you are talking about the fact that Starbucks must now repay the outstanding gift-card debts, using Fold will not take 20% from Starbucks, but merely save the user 20%.
Fold is great.

I think some coins might try to do this someday to secure their coin, but I do not see this happening a lot.  It 'definitely' would not happen with Litecoin.
I say 'definitely' in quotes because I just cant predict the future, but it would make no sense for Litecoin to sidechain, as it is the altcoin with actual mining infrastructure and security

The convenience of not having the full wallet client outweighs the advantages to me...  But I understand your point completely.

I hope I don't get down voted, but I tend to when I mention altcoins.  The only real blockchain, and wallet software I use is for a Proof Of Stake coin.
Honestly, we can't all do it 'for the network', and run Bitcoin nodes etc... But if I can throw some Hyper into my full client wallet, and stake it, and earn more...   There is an advantageous benefit to running a node, and the actual wallet client.
I tried installing Bitcoin qt years back, wasn't worth it for me.
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:38:53
Good point.  If I had this, I would use it as I currently use a credit card: In specific situations only.

Be very careful who you lend your bitcoins to.  I think in current days, investing bitcoins to gain more bitcoins is silly.  Bitcoins are an investment.  
If you are investing Bitcoins, assume you are just investing dollars, but are using Bitcoin as a transfer mechanism.

ID verification is pretty common.  I am not sure what exactly cex.io is requesting for verification, mind you.
I have used cex.io a couple years ago.  They are/were a combined company of cex.io and ghash.io - one of the biggest mining pools.
I never had any problems, and their site was quite appealing and functioned well.  
I can not speak for what bank they use, etc.

It is ludicrous.  I can use a different crypto, and not get burned by the stupid bitcoin fee.

Ethereum is the newer technology.  I would say that it is the problem.

@_date: 2016-01-08 15:55:09
Yes.  They are cool.  Why wouldn't they exist and have value?   I recognize that everyone says "the network effect of money is powerful" and that Bitcoin will be THE ONE.  
Ask yourself this:  What is that idea based off of?  A past bitcoin network on the internet?  It is based on pure hopes that their bitcoin stash will continue to appreciate, and not lose any value to altcoins.  Too late, and too bad.
My opinion is that altcoins drastically add to the decentralization of cryptocurrency.  We are lucky that altcoins exist.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:50:17
3 cents is a crazy fee.  This is digital money.
If you were to design the ideal cryptocurrency, there is NO way you would determine that a 3c fee would be acceptable.

Make a positive post on r/bitcoin about any altcoin, and you will see what Voorhees is talking about...
Even mention Litecoin.  That is a total scam apparently according to a lot of bitcoiners.
Lol, its almost humorous the ignorance
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:50:47
In your scenario you are still using Bitcoin for every transaction.  Converting to Litecoin and then paying in Litecoin makes no sense.  You then pay a btc fee, an exchange fee, and a litecoin fee.  
The point of this thread is that Litecoin fees are lower.

Sound reasoning to a programmer invested in Bitcoin I guess.
The logic is off.  If Litecoin is a scam, so is Bitcoin.
If there was no such thing as Litecoin, then fuck.  We would all be trapped in a broken coin with serious problems that aren't being solved with any sort of urgency, relying on a single group of programmers...  Bitcoin is in a jam.  If you can't see that, you are not looking.  I can guarantee that I am not the only person that would stay away if Bitcoin was the only simple Blockchain currency.
Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, but I know I can not count on it to survive and evolve.  Litecoin already solves a number of the problems.

yes bitaddress is a good website.  
Consider that there is always the possibility of malware on your computer that can view contents on your screen.  
The best bet is to save the website, and access it offline on a computer that has not accessed the internet.  It can be a fairly complicated process, but there are tutorials online that simplify it.
I am sorry but I could not quickly find a tutorial, however this website mentions what I am talking about:

Most or all comments so far have been in agreement with you, however, I must disagree and be the one putting down bitcoin today.  Do not get me wrong I am a big fan of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  Yes, being your own bank is "priceless" as another user has said.  
Roughly a month ago, however, I paid more than $0.75 for a bitcoin transaction.  That is not a small amount of money.   
Lets be serious, when I send a letter over the internet (email) it is free.  Why then should sending money be any different?  The $0.75 may have been an outlier, and may have been unusually high, but that is what I had to pay.  
@_date: 2016-11-11 03:10:27
Very nice
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:36:23
I had a similar fear for paper wallets.  It was similar to my initial fear of using Bitcoin in general.  After you have swept a few paper wallets the fear goes away, similar to after you send a few bitcoin transactions.
I like paper wallets.  Just make sure you created them securely.
