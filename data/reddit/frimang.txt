Tried that. It doesn't help.
The price is allmost frozen for about an hour or so... Very few transactions, with only few coins each..
Prepare to the great fall, we all expected it might start with hackers attack. I just wish I could change my pre-programmed orders to lower prices... And pray the attack, if it is actually an hackers attack, wouldn't succeed... Or all the money I have there might fly away (?)...

Isn't it a bif of waste just to spread your bitcoins around like that, on a paper wallets, to people who may not even know what they are?
If you have some spare coins that you don't know what to do with, I do know someone who surely will apreciate it... :-)

well, I'm not an american, I don't know how those Senate hearings are going on..
However, If (or when, eventually) there will be some kind of public USA bitcoin acceptance statment, it would make last monday's 900$ pick to look like a little hiccup

And as other said, you have a great service. Thanks.

in the microwave I can always stop the process manually when the popps are fading.
As I said, my biggest concern is that when the fall will start, the trading sites will pull out the plug and get offline. Not to mention the very possible option that the reason for the bubble blow might be an hacker's attack on one of the large trading sites, which might make us not able to send buying orders...

Here you can see the average rate from 30 biggest btc exchanges:
I think it is the most decent rate to choose when doing buisness with bitcoin

Nope. Quadcopters are controlled by a computerized flight controller board, loaded with gyros, accilometers, barometer, GPS, ETC. Good flight controllers are wise enough to keep the UAV stable as a rock regardless of uncontrolled contitiones, like winds. Most of them are also cappable of fully automated flight, guided by GS waypoints. It is really cool hobby. but it is too much time consuming for me, so I sold mine.  Left only my RC planes and Helicopters.
anyway, It`s way off topic...

It is predictible in terms of linear regression, with limitations. Thats what I meant. Of course it is not a simple one factor linear regression, but it still has general determinants of a linear regression, more like a multiple factors linear regression. 
And if you think about it from this point of view, the causing factor for the growth constant is not the price, but the mining difficulty factor; it is because the algotirhem that produce the growth in difficulty was there before the currency actually existed. There are of course inter correlations between those factors, but since the algorithem was there before the currency value was, he predicts the value, and not vice versa. In terms of statistical reaserch methods, the mining difficulty factor predicts the value, and at the same time balanced back by it, through inter corellations.  Maybe my point of view is different because I come from the area of behavioral sience reaserch, not from the engineers point of view.

There is a MT gox app in Cidia which seems to be very usefull for traders, but for some reason I didn't manage to link the app with my MT gox account. Meanwhile I took all my money out of MTgox (the daily trade made me too nervous) so I didn't really tried it myself.

I'm just saying that as someone that is allready invested in bitcoin (although not in large amounts) I'm focusing on the linear growth more than on the waves. The linear growth is a function of the conitinious growth in mining difficulty, that makes the mining profitability decline in a quite fixed ratio (this ratio changes every 4 years, as we all know), hence leading to a more of the less fixed linear growth in BTC buying rate (the linear growth is aproximately 30-35% a month, averagely, for the last year or so), nothing else; while the bubbles are function of a lot of unpredictible variables. New adaptors are fascinated by those rapid bubbles growth and most of them are frightened by the following declinations. They are not aware to the linear growth pattern over time, and think that bitcoin is a method for earning hundreds of dollars within days. And whom who are following this kind of belief, are due to be the first to run away when the rates goes down. This is another reason for the bitcoin's rate being so unstable. It is important to educate the new people that enter the bitcoin market this days about the various, different patterns of growth in this market; if they will expect those periodic peaks and drops, they will stay longer in the market rather running away every now and then.  Then, we will all benefit a little more stability in BTC rates. 
And making my argument short: I do believe that the peak of the current climb will be reached around next monday, and I estimate it will be around 300$ for 1 BTC; but since linearly it is expected to reach this rate only around mid of january 2014, a major drop must occure, due to the minning difficulty balancing factor. A lot of people will run away when this drop will come, and I'm sorry for their lose, because BTC WILL reach this rate soon enough, lineary. And will keep climbing in a linear pattern much higher.

Thats awsome! I sold my own quadcopter for bitcoins a few weeks ago, but for a private guy.
Actually for a while I was thinking how comes that no UAV company got into the bitcoin market... I used mine for aerial photography and video flights, but those can be used for small packages automated deliveries, spying, etc... Work your imagination a bit, you'll understand why there might be people who would like to buy UAV's for anonymous bitcoins; not for an hobby style aerial photography, I mean...

It is not a big secret, I just have a good memory...
About a month ago a question was raised to the central election committee in the USa, asking an approval to raise election donations in bitcoins. The committee obligated to give her answer until 28.10.
I believe this is the first time that a central govermental committee in the usa is going to declare a public position regarding to Bitcoins; hence, I believe any answer they will give, may cause a significant climb in BTC rates.

how much time did it took them the last time (on April) to get over the attack? It`s being stuck for allmost 6 hours now.

For those of us who lives outside of USA, can someone help us watch the media cover for the Senate hearing today (if will be), by arranging a web live broadcast of the event?

Thank you for your expenation; but, reagarding to this:
 Someone decided it is a good time to sell 2,000 bitcoins and then someone else sold another 2,000 bitcoins. A bunch of smaller people sell and that adds up. Then people think I should sell and then 12,000 bitcoins are sold.
I believe you're naive... 
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:54:42
It is quite disturbing.
However, if you are not a criminal, why would you care if your address is known? I think there is no other way to regulate the market of bitcoins, and without regulation I find it hard to believe that states will accept bitcoin as legal and legitimate. And, at least in our own generation, I don't see a way to broader public acceptence without states legitimate bitcoins.
On the other hand, tracking all tainted history of any fragment of bitcoin ever used - it is both unpractical, and not a moral thing to do. And dangerous. If this kind of protocol will become a reality, it might destroy bitcoin; but a little bit of regulations might do some good things to bitcoin, in my opinion.

Hmmm... Thats interesting. What you mean is that the "trading volume" doesn't mean how many coins are at the moment stocked in Mt.Gox, but how many coins switched hands at the specified period of time? If so, I guesse I got this concept all wrong. Actually your explenation perfectly makes sense- people are waiting I guesse to the next big crash, which makes them less keen to buy in higher rates right now... (?) 
And about understanding the psychology of +1000 people... Well, you got me :-), this is my profession, I guesse it is in to me trying to understand how people thinks, feels and acts.

One of the most important things I have learned in the field of statistics, is that an outcome doesn't actually know that it is statistically unsignificant; meanning to say, even if the odds for such an occurrence are very low, it is still possible.

This rapid changes makes me a little cautious;
We have a really good song in hebrew about the great financial crash of 1982, in one of the lines the singer sings: "The public is stupid, so the public will pay, what easily comes, as easy as that will go away".
Hopes we are not standing before a siginficant crash in bitcoins rate, following this rapid climb. I believe this rapid climb may atract a lot of new adopters to the bitcoin currency; a following big crash will mean that all of those new adopters will loose a lot of money, and such a scenario is not a good PR to bitcoin.

Mark my words... This bubble ain't over yet.
It will reach it's highest peak on next monday.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:19:12
Exactly what I thought. The uprise is way over the linear regression line pattern . I believe it will go down to around 250$ in the next few hours... Hope to be right, cause I hate to loose money.

I guesse you can just find someone who will agree to get bitcoins as a payment from you, and pay in credit card to who ever you'll ask him to. Guesse you are familiar with the famous Pizzas purchase for 10,000btc each...

Raising a question for open discussion doesn't necessarely means not knowing the common comunity accepted answer. 
Writing at the same subreddit as you doesn't mean we have to share exactly the same opinions.  I think bitcoin is a great thing, but as I said, i believe that some minor regulations might do something good to bitcoin broader acceptence and adoption, at the end of the day
