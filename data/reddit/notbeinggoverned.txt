Good catch. Thanks. We'll update with an editors note.

You can have overdraft protection on your bank accounts that ensures your transactions complete but pull from your savings or a line of credit.

Permission? It was on a public forum for an open source project with no stated or implied reservation of rights. It is hardly spam considering we have respectfully introduced him to our readership across several platforms who have largely not heard of him and won't be heading to the Bitcointalk forums any time soon (assuming uptime). I'm sure Hal is turning over in his cryo-tube over the 42 cents in ad revenue this post has generated. But in case he's not, your butthurt more than makes up for it.

Dear Merchants,
Accepting Credit Cards poses too big a risk. Use Bitcoin.

"grab an army up"
From where?
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:19:27
More less... except for the state government, the national army, the funding of groups by foreign states, the invasion of foreign states and the gun control laws. Other than that, sure, just like Afghanistan.

One gang has gotten larger. It's called the United States Military. How can you escape this gang? There is no overarching state police to step in and squash this particularly violent gang that is attempting to control great areas.
In the United States, one gang has gotten larger. The ones that wear blue and invade homes with no-knock raids and kidnap people who put non-Big-pharma approved drugs in their bodies. It's the gang that kidnaps people from the side of the road and often just murders their victims. How can you escape this gang? They ARE the overarching state police.
Assuming a stateless society can't solve this problem that a state-based society hasn't solved either, then we settle for knowing that while this problem will likely go unsolved, the problem of international wars will be largely addressed. It takes a state to consolidate enough resources to build or conscript an army that can be as globally destructive as we see today. We'll accept the scenario that tribal skirmishes will likely continue at various spots around the globe. But this is a preferable state of affairs to state led wars. 
There is some further discussion on this here:

Look at places that have been devastated by state wars and socialist governments! See anarchy can't work!

So where's your warlord endeavor getting that money?
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:20:22
Nice faith based statement. I'm sure you'll get some idiots to believe you too. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:40:04
If your worse case scenario for a stateless society is that a state emerges, you might want rethink your argument.

You mean Iraq that has elections and a national government and an army? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:26:23
The simple answer to your question is that no one is restricted from owning any weapons. Good luck with your warlordism when every other person can defend themselves. States thrive because they ensure they have the most powerful weapons and outlaw the populace from being able to defend against them.

Yeah. I figured. You just pre-suppose wealth in your fantasy. Not understanding the nature of wealth is probably a big contributor to your being poor.

When governments collapse, free trade generally emerges. You can see this in natural disasters when governments tend to be their most ineffective. Quickly, networks develop of barter and exchange. These systems tend to get squashed once the government has gotten around to functioning again.
But I think you are referring to government collapses (like Syria and Iraq) that aren't actually collapses so much as they are foreign state actions that overthrow a state government in an attempt to replace it with another state government.
Our "theory" isn't to overthrow and replace with another state government. We are advocating that parallel structures be erected to make the existing state government services obsolete. That is a fundamental principle of bitcoin. It replaces national currencies with a stateless solution. The whole point is that the tools are emerging to replace every function that state governments currently provide. As those services are made obsolete and decentralized alternatives are available then the answer becomes "yes". The state collapsing will increase prosperity and free trade.

Ok, I'll rephrase it. Not understanding the nature of wealth is definitely a big contributor to your being poor. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:45:57
Cool story bro. 
Try to evade taxes and see if you don't have a gun to your head. That's your only contribution. 
You aren't still so naive that you believe in voting are you?
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:22:29
You are referring to the United States, I assume?
