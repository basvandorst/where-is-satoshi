Made most of it was made by day trading. A small percentage from family throw away money they gave me cuz they don't know anything about btc but wanted to get in. The rest like 75% was mine from the original fund. I got a much bigger fund in stocks,bonds, options, etfs... im much more diversified in safer assets. I was stupid n cocky by  putting it all in one coin tho

Ive not met a more rational user on this sub, or at least engaged in. I completely agree with yr statement. Ppl said the crash was caused by fundamentals n how btc is becoming congested. Like no. It was because FUD n the catalyst being bcash n coinbase. All the major correction was driven by news and human emotions. Everyone knows or at least suspects it bubble n it's nothing wrong with one. Ppl can make a lottttt of money if they can time it right. In all honesty I'm doing just that. Not trying to be the one holding a bag of shit when it's all said n done. Btc is not backed by a company with real intrinsic value. Clearing ppl are speculating n to peak at 20k? That's fucking crazy n historic like you said. I have more faith in ethereum as they are a real company solving and implementing blockchain but even they are caught in the btc space too. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:06:40
I don't get how bitcoin is a medium of exchange. I know that's the goal here but I btc is not 1 btc or a dollar. Why would you give btc away when you think it's gonna appreciate in value and why would you accept it if it might devalue by 20% the next day. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:56
It seems I can only buy xrp with btc. Doesn't seems like I can exchange it with ether like you said. 
I can buy ether right not on coinbase n I'll have my ether ready. 
I don't want to use my btc cuz I'm trying to hold my btc till I can make up my losses

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:52:00
I certainly believe there is some intrinsic value in blockchain technology but hard to attribute a real number to certain coins or company because it's all so nascent. With real companies there are cash flows, 10k, corporate governance you can look at to obtain a single value. You would then short or long in comparison with the current market value. Ppl talk about using the rate of which bitcoin is used as a medium of exchange to come up with an intrinsic in financial modeling but you can already see the problem with btc being as a currency. It's more of a commodity now. I hear you there. I was stupid and cocky in putting all my money in one basket. Def gonna diversify into more altcoin. I'm not worried about btc but rather annoyed cuz my money is locked in it. If I sell now at current market price I would lose thousands n thousands. I also don't want to take a little loss to day trade cuz market is not stable enough for me to even begin to analyze. I suggest you also branch out in other assets like stocks n bonds. With Feds increase in rates n tax cut, the equity market is looking good. Especially the financial sector.

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:44
This was straight up FUD with Bch n coinbase being the catalyst. If we're still talking about fundamentals then this would've happened way earlier. Btc price is not driven by fundamentals. More than half of its investors don't even understand what blockchain is. If yr looking for fundamentals then look else where but even so why does it tank at the same rate as btc. It should withheld given its fundamentals. Seems the whole crypto eco system is just driven by greed. Although lots of ppl are passionate about this and want to see technology to change the world, its too nascent that has lots of problems n it's already being run by greedy institutions who doesn't give two cents but only if they make money.

Blinded by bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:24:57
Ive been doing really well with day trading with some modeling Ive been developing. Yes I would've made more if I just let it sit but day volatility was too great to pass up. I like my high reward so yes I take high risk. This time around I just completely blind sided by Bch like everyone else. I couldn't sell when it passed my threshold of selling and market is too unstable right now that day trading and trying to make my money back would be too unpredictable. I tried arbitraging once but it didn't work out as I only only use Gemini n coinbase and obviously transactions between the two exchanges were too long so it didn't work out. I couldn't sign up with poloneix. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:03:01
Only if he puts it as market sell then he would sweep the book. That's when we should worry as I'm sure it'll shave off a few thousands

Bitcoin is so volatile, I wonder how ppl come up with future prices. It's literally just throwing a dart in the dark. Surely and hardly anyone would take a short position on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:35:27
Bitcoin is so volatile, it's hard to attribute what percentage of change would be bull or bear cuz it can change every hour but a 20% correction on the Dow or SnP will sure cause a financial meltdown and will take a long long time to recover. And it's easy for ppl who bought below the depreciation price to say it's nothing to worry about as they're still up but what about the ppl who bought it at the top? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:56

Another cringey post. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:08:18
Honestly day trading is all about technical analysis and keeping yr eyes fixed for event risk (e.g. What just happened with Bch. everyone was completely blindsided by that). You want to move with volume momentum. Open a few exchanges to see what the sentiment is. Review charts for the past day to see where the support and resistance line are although crypto is super unpredictable so you never want to allocate 100% of yr fund trying to guess when to buy and sell. Allocate a certain percentage. For me , about 25% for starting off. There's no intrinsic value in crypto so that's why I day trade. It's all about pricing and people's emotion. If you see that you can consistently guess which direction it's gonna move with momentum, up your ante just like in blackjack. 
You can read on some some people's financial and pricing modeling. I haven't really completely mine yet, in the process,  so I don't want to give you something that I haven't tested.

Most ppl trade futures only cares about cash settlements. Futures will bring Wall Street investors which will lead to mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:50:00
Future market is intended to be a conduit for deliverance of the underlying asset so yeah yr right it doesn't make any sense if it's just cash settlement. Short answer is it's literally for someone who doesn't  care much for bitcoin but only want a way to profit from it. Investors don't care what they're investing only profit. I think this could make holders of bitcoin more valuable since there are high demand but limited supply.

I day trade on volume sentiment with percentage allocation. It's quite doable but high risk high reward. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:01
Exactly. I started to notice an increase in the amount of buy n sell. No smaller player can afford to make a move like that n all the smaller player are watching to move with momentum. There would be a large buy at one price n then a mother large sale only 50 dollars above. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:41:10

Interesting times. No doubt btc/blockchain is a game changer no matter which side you are. I was too young for dot com bubble  but I love hearing stories and financial histories. I'm glad to be part of this one as it will go down in the book. 
I don't think bitcoin price will completely pop but it'll just bubble up and down like a hot air balloon and like you said this seems to a pattern. This is my second but this one hit me the hardest cuz I have a lot of money riding at the top. I know it's gonna go back up. I'm just annoyed my money is locked as I'm trying to hodl and have no more money to buy the dip. 
How did you get into btc so early? I was fresh out of hs back then and I didn't major in CS or anything like that so I don't think I would've caught it early. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:11
Short answer is you take advantage of mispricing  on different  markets trading the same underlying. Buy low at one place and moving it to a different place to sell at a higher price. Most important  factors are timing and accessibility. Can you do it fast enough before the price catches up and is it feasible after accounting for maybe fees and exchange rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:04:02
Outsiders must be like no shit it's a bubble. Corrections like this only reaffirms them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:24:04
M just mad cuz my money is locked in hodling and I can't buy more. Don't want to buy on credit either cuz who knows if it's gonna dip lower and I can't transfer my money back 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:50:21
I do understand the congestion n the ridiculous fees btc. That's why I believe with conviction that it will never become a currency. At least not until we fix these issues. I just  think the price of btc has gotten so out hand that it just doesn't justify its fundamental value anymore and it's all thanks to a flood of new investor bidding the price up thinking they can get rich fast and not caring about the underlying technology 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:10
Don't worry about where I put my money. You think I have all my money in crypto. Ive got money in bonds stocks etfs hell even treasuries in other countries. Yes I'm not diversified in coins but I am in other safe assets with real intrinsic value. I'll take high reward along with the high risk in crypto. I know we're in a bubble with crypto although some will survive. LTEA just skyrocketed cuz they changed their name to long blockchain. What the fuck is a beverage company doing in blockchain technology. If that isn't some sort of warning I don't know what is. I'm just trying to not hold the bag of shit when it goes haywire. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:31:09
Nice. I was too young n wasn't looking at the right  places. I wished I majored finance earlier in my college days. I switched from premed but now graduated in finance. I probably would have caught the wind just in time before the blow up but what ever. Hindsight is always 20/20. 
In all honesty I majored in finance cuz I wanted to live a financially comfortable life and when bitcoin came along, I thought this was my chance to get there quickly. Yes I am just another greedy with no altruistic motives. But this roller coaster has taught me a lot about greed and fear. I plan to study financial human behavior cuz I think it's so fascinating and an important component in  investing. 
Yeah bubbles come and go a few times. I don't think it's inherently bad. Just gotta time the gravy train to make lots of money. Don't be the one with out the chair when the music ends like you said.

No. That's idiotic exuberance. I hope it peaks well below that but stabilize as a commodity. With 100k yr asking for severe correction is like this n ppl will get royally fucked. We shouldn't be greedy at the risk of someone who comes in late in the game.

I get why those who's at a loss and have no choice but to hodl but what about ppl like you who's seen a substantial amount of unrealized profit.  What's your threshold of cashing out?
