Good.  Fuck them.  Instead of being a positive foundation for Miners, they scammed people just like BFLabs.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:00:36
I used this address to take payments and mine in 2013.  I was scammed by BFLabs with the Single SC, I was scammed by KNC with the Neptune.  This could get me back to mining again.

Buy a storage device like a Trezor.  Don't just buy a Trezor though, do your own research.  Once you commit to a device, learn about how it works.  Know how to restore your wallet should the device be destroyed, before the device is actually destroyed.  Then buy as much as you can afford at a rate which makes sense to you.  Personally I buy X BTC every 2 weeks.  Then do your best to stay away from FUD and don't watch the price.  Both of those things are bad on your heart.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:13:38
How does what work specifically?  You'll need to verify your account and attach a payment method to buy or sell.  Once you've done that, it should tell you your limit.

I don't have evidence, except for my anecdotal experience with them.  However others do and they formed a class action.  So when that finally wraps up, considering the accusations in it line up with what I've written, this'll be the most stale "I told you so" I never wanted.
And if it doesn't?  It doesn't change the fact that Avalon, BFLabs, and KnC all couldn't get their shit together somehow despite all having backgrounds in ASIC manufacturing.


I feel like that's the pot calling the kettle black.  A lack of evidence doesn't equate to evidence of the contrary.  I think Socrates or someone came up with a name for that.
But anyways dude, I'm not gonna keep going back and forth about how neither of us have evidence and how despite that to you your opinion is more valid than mine.

That's what's called a catchall and it's entirely malicious if the only reason it was "or more" was because they were mining on them instead of shipping.


It's not a dead end, it's not even settled.
So cut your bullshit man.  Now that you've been ousted as BFL_Josh or whatever and now that you're downvoting my statements in our discussion, consider me over it.  Fuck you, you thief.
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:19:53
At this point, the "end user" has no reason not to be demanding.  BFLabs is in a class action right now accused of mining on hardware for months before shipping it and I wouldn't be surprised if KnC didn't do the same thing.  Behind both of those companies (and I'm sure other companies too) is a wake of broken trust and lost money.
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:37:49
Man, they fucking did it to me again!  First my money, now my time wasted.
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:41:38
I feel like you have no idea the extent at which BFLabs and KnC fucked people over.
You realize BFLabs accepted people's money.  In some cases thousands of dollars (in my case $3k).  Promised a delivery of six months later.  Didn't deliver until just before some (not all) of their customers would make only enough to pay for their initial investment a year and a half later.  All the while mining on that very hardware and lying about it.
And then to have the mastermind behind it move away from BFLabs onto KNC and convince them to follow the same pattern.  Again, burning people for $6k or more.
Those are just the ones that I got fucked over on.  They're not the only ones.  So unless you just didn't know this was happening, I really fail to see how you could think "end users" as you call them are the assholes or in any way irrational for how they conduct business now.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:38:31

The underlying problem, as I understand it, is that the manufacturer who produced chips for them stopped making that architecture 6 months prior to a lot of what was going on.  With a 6 month window they were either incompetent getting those chips baked or were mining on users hardware.

@_date: 2017-08-22 20:53:34


That's okay!  What's important is that you're interested in learning to.  I'd say [start with this video.](  It's not mine, but its description is pretty on point for installing Ubuntu Linux on a Virtual Machine back in 2013.  The age of the video shouldn't be a huge factor, just always go for the latest version of software.  
Doing this in a VM is important because you don't want to trash (potentially) the only PC you have.  In a Virtual Machine you can goof as many times as you have to.
Once you're able to get a VM running, do it a second time to make sure.  Hell, do it a third time because then you'll need to get a few new (and advanced) things under your belt.  
Specifically ask yourself:
* [how do I update Ubuntu?](
* [how do I use a terminal emulator?](
* [how do I SSH to my new Linux machine from Windows?](
* [what the hell even is SSH?](
* [how do I do some basic BASH programming?](
* [what the hell is a repository?](
Once you're messing around in the terminal a bit, doing some bash scripting and using vim to write some files, consider using something a little more aggressive like [Archlinux.](  Arch is a barebones bleeding edge Linux distribution, but by no means is it necessary to get a node running.
After you've done all of that stuff, check out [PC Part Picker]( and and study the different parts of a PC.  Once you know what a motherboard is and what its socket types are and how to match those to RAM and CPU, you should be able to choose a budget or start looking on your local Craigslist etc. for deals.  Ask yourself "how much money could I spend on a PC right now without going into debt.  Even if it's $150, you still have [a *ton* of options.](  Personally, I'd go for an older server in the $60 to $100 range that can be dedicated to this cause and is already assembled for you.
Finally when you've done all of the above, you can check out [this guide.](  It'll help you get a node going.
Hope this helps.  PM me if you ever get stuck.  It's a long journey ahead of you, but it's rewarding.
