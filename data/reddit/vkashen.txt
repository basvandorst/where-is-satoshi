A 10th grade student in my son's class apparently has over $1 million in Bitcoin. He's actually a very smart kid, tech-centric (it's a special tech/engineering high school), so it's not surprising that it would be him, but the whole school is abuzz with this information. It's kind of funny to think how many other high school students may have the same.

No. In the US, any "change" in the status of an asset like crypto (e.g. buy, sell, exchange for another asset) is a taxable event. is not correct is saying that trading (or "buying") another coin with bitcoin is not a taxable event, it absolutely *is* a taxable event per the IRS. Anyone who buys anything with their bitcoin, be it litecoin, any other crypto, or a hot dog, *will* owe capital gains taxes on their gain at the moment of that taxable event. Anyone not paying those gains taxes will find themselves at the sharp end of a pointy stick the IRS will be aiming at people pretty soon. I guarantee that the IRS will be making an example of people in the near future to scare everybody into paying their taxes instead of hiding them thinking crypto is anonymous. It absolutely is not, and there are now businesses devoted to tracking wallets (addresses) and linking them to people so that they can find tax cheats. And the IRS uses the biggest one to do exactly this.
It has nothing to do with "converting to fiat," it's about exchanging the crypto for *anything* else, be it goods or services.

Yes. Absolutely. What a fund can do is outlined in its Offering Memorandum and a fund may invest in anything within the scope of the contract. My fund, for example, has had many things other than pure securities such as restaurant franchises and we've even infested in films. I've checked with my in house counsel and we can invest in cryptocurrency as well should we wish to. Some funds have been set up specifically to do this, and for others, if it's withing their scope, then buying and selling crypto is perfectly fine. There are certainly risks that would need to be factored in, but there is no law preventing hedge funds from doing this at all.

I probable didn't articulate that well, I didn't mean any regulation of the protocol, merely the business of buying/selling/using Bitcoin. What I meant by that is that there are security issues involving simply using Bitcoin, and there are still security issues with the protocol itself that will be shored up over time. I only support very light regulation, but feel that  the simple act of deciding regulation is necessary is a huge step towards legitimizing the Bitcoin market. Banks need to be regulated. For the safety of consumers, Bitcoin oriented businesses should be lightly regulated as well (IMHO) to to ensure consumers don't get screwed over. 
We know how the Banks will take every dollar from your pocket if they could find a way, and if they get into the Bitcoin business in any way, they will try to screw the consumer over as much as they can, and regulation leads to consumer protection if done properly.

They've been at war for thousands of years, and seem to love it (both sides). The difference is that Israel is an occupying force that took land from someone else in the modern era and now has the means to engage in genocide, which they are doing with as much trickery and PR spin as they can. While I condemn the violence, I'm not surprised that the Palestinians have to resort to these tactics to take their rightfully owned land back. 
Israel was given that land out of guilt, not because it was theirs, and now the west is paying the price for screwing over the Middle East for oil. It is definitely not black and white, but if someone invaded my country and put my children in a ghetto, I'd be fighting with *my* life to take my land back and have something for my family. The problem is that Israel has tricked the US into supporting them with the notion that a "stable ally" is needed, while Israel is no ally to the US. Europe knows how fucked up it is, but isn't in a position to do anything about it now. The Brits fucked it up for everyone taking that land and giving it away, so ultimately it's their fault for creating a terrorist nation like Israel. I'm no Palestinian apologist, but they are not herding children into ghettos as the Israelis are doing. It is apartheid, plain and simple, which I cannot support.

Again, I did not articulate myself properly as I 100% agree with you. I absolutely do *not* want comprehensive regulation, it would destroy Bitcoin.

The Chinese government is much smarter and more devious than the US. When they realize that they will be at a disadvantage if they truly outlaw bitcoin, they will find a way to reverse it and still protect their fiat reserves and the flow of currency. Their primary concern is keeping money onshore, if they can protect themselves and still allow BTC, they will dominate the US, which is also scared of it, but is slightly more likely to really accept it as private entities with a lot of financial power realize there is money to be made.

Bitcoin is not money (in the US), it is an asset (property). So at least for now, he's fine. If it is ever declared an alternate currency, then he'll have problems.

While I personally like the idea of regulating Bitcoin to address many issues regarding security (both consumer security as well as the protocol itself) I am concerned about both sides of the regulation coin.
1. Regulating Bitcoin will enhance its legitimacy in the (at least NY) market, and will provide needed protections for all parties involved. This has been one issue (regulation) that I have been waiting for with great anticipation. On the whole, this is a positive step forward and I am eager to see more infrastructure for fund transfer and capital investment be created based on a legal framework with which to work inside.
2. Regulation has its downsides as well. "Over-regulation" could possibly lead to issues as a NY state regulation may lead to problems with other state, federal, and international bodies, and may hamper adoption during the process of ensuring all regulations are similar in scope and don't lead to inefficiencies or even increasing difficulty for all parties in a transaction or transfer. It may also erode some of the financial incentives that may make Bitcoin a leader in fund transfer, which could weaken it as an option for fund transfer. Bitcoin could lead to enormous cost saving for businesses, governments, and individuals, but over-regulation may offset some of those benefits if it occurs. 
Would you care to comment on these two thoughts and how much emphasis you placed on these issues while the regulations were being drafted? Bitcoin has enormous potential, but if the benefits are outweighed by the mandates of a legal framework which everyone must operate under, adoption and efficiencies may be eroded. While I see this as a step in the right direction, we must also acknowledge that the burden of using Bitcoin must not be such that they (the regulations) result in the loss of the great potential Bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:35:27
Making the government irrelevant would be horrible. We need schools, hospitals, roads, etc. But taking the government out of our personal lives is extremely important. We can have both, and being an extremist is the best way to be ignored. Try to find the good in everything and use it. A government should not be allowed to tell you what colour underwear to wear, or whether you can use fiat currency, Bitcoin, or barter to acquire goods and services, but in order for a society to work, there is a collective entity that should allow a structured society. We'd all be dead without *some* form of government, but we don't need the dictatorships that most countries run under with the guise of democracy.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:15:16
I don't believe so personally. *If* (and it's definitely an "if") Bitcoin succeeds, I actually see the price vastly increasing over time due to the increase in transaction numbers as well as values. To work on a large scale it will have to have a high value so that people will be able to transact in millibits rather than paying 10 Bitcoins for a product. The fixed supply will actually be to its benefit (particularly for those who see is as an investment rather than a store of value) if it becomes a de facto platform (and personally I hope it does).
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:40:44
As an ex-banker with quant experience, you will be very surprised at the clever ways bankers will find to manipulate the Bitcoin market. I have a lot personally and want to see it succeed, but don't think for a minute that bankers won't resort to the dirtiest &amp; most clever tactics (that their developers can think up for them) to exploit the market.

Of course. There is a massive and fundamental difference in the cultures in the US and China; the Chinese are eager to embrace technological and economic change and always look to the future, while American conservatives have to be dragged into it, as they refuse any and all change. They also tend to control US assets and technology. This is why China will control the future crypto market if the US doesn't wise up and realize that maintaining the status quo is the best way to *lose* capital and economic influence, and Western economic interests will lost to the Chinese.

And the neat thing about crypto (Bitcoin and others) is that the code can be changed (e.g. the addition to SegWit to Bitcoin) and any features of any "better coins" can be added to Bitcoin down the road. I actually expected Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin as a higher value platform, but lately, in retrospect, realizing that Bitcoin has first to market advantage, and can, theoretically be modified to have the same services that Ethereum offers, so barring anything cataclysmic, I believe it has legs and won't be supplanted any time soon.

Banks see asset appreciation and capital gains a lot, and if the OP is reporting the gains to the IRS as they should be, it won't raise any eyebrows. Also, capital gains is significantly lower than taxes on earned income. And I'd argue that it's a good problem to have. Wouldn't you rather pay ~$200K in taxes and have $800K, or not have any money to pay taxes on? For me, it's a no-brainer.

It's very simple:
1. Make sure that all gains are long term gains.
2. Have residency in a state that does not charge *state* capital gains (e.g. Connecticut will tax cap gains over a certain amount while Florida does not). This could make a difference between paying 20% and 40% in capital gains taxes.
A good accountant can help you ensure you do not pay  more than you have to.

Young markets are very volatile. We have a lot of people looking at bitcoin with no economic or market experience, so volatility like this is perceived as a scary thing. Those of us who are Bitcoin veterans and have economic and market experience understand that this volatility is normal, going to continue until the crypto market matures some more, and will take advantage of said volatility. Amirite?

Actually high net worth individuals pay a higher cap gains rate than less well off people. If you make more than a certain amount in a given year, your cap gains taxes are higher. It's a tiered system based on income for the year. So the federal cap gains tax can be up to 20%.

You'd think it was a no-brainer, right? Obviously it would require a lot of due diligence, regulatory hurdles, etc, but any brokerage firm that is tier 1 should be looking into this (if they aren't already) as I'd move assets there. I've got btc spread all over in different wallets in cold storage and hot storage (I would never keep all my eggs in one basket) but the idea that Morgan Stanley, for example, or UBS, would offer this service, and would simply list your btc alongside your equities, bonds, etc, in your account, would be awesome.
I'm a retired banker and I keep my nose in the game and hear stirrings, but that's it. AFAIK no one is actually legitimately looking at doing this (exploring blockchain tech is something they *are* looking at though), and it makes me want to jump back into the game, even though I hated it, just to spearhead an operational project to make this work. Oh well... Perhaps one day. For now, I'll just hope my organizational skills will allow me to not lose anything. :)

Yep, moving BTC between exchanges and buying/selling ETH. I hope this keeps up all year! :)
I should qualify that. I'm buying BTC on exchanges at the $100-$300 discount, moving it to a high price exchange, converting it to ETH, moving that back to cash on my favourite exchange and using it to buy BTC again at a discount. That avoids having to move USD around, ETH is the carry. Rinse... Repeat....

Tax loss selling is pretty common in the last week of the fiscal year. Crypto is still pair trading with equity markets so I expect it to happen. It'll be nice one say when they don't pair trade, but for the foreseeable future, it'll absolutely happen in tandem. Did you notice how it's up 14% today with the market, after the Fed said they weren't going to raise rates? It's bizarre how the two markets are synchronized, but understandable until people figure out crypto as a stand-alone financial market.

It's only China, not the rest of the world. Plus, it is to create a regulatory structure similar to what the US is doing, so that they can better control crypto use with regard to capital flows. When it's over, the uncertainty will be gone, so in that regard it's good.
Unlike the US, China tends to be heavy handed, which I don't agree with, but I'm not a Chinese party member, so it doesn't matter. I agree with what they are doing, if not how they are doing it though. Regulation will lead to less FUD from China once it's settled.

I didn't mean it literally. I was saying that it's no longer a "hidden asset" to wealthy people who understand finance and technology. There are still *many* people who still haven't gotten involved and eventually will, but just a comment that most of my colleagues at least have bought cryptos for their personal portfolios. I've owned bitcoin since it was below a dollar. When people understand the kind os gains we've seen since 2010, they perk up and listen. ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:54:04
I'm with you 110% ;)
I personally don't think it will long term. Even if China were to outright ban cryptos, which I highly doubt will happen as they are probably the smartest country on the planet (smarter than the US) in terms of their desire to own technologies that are forward looking, I still think the rest of the world would never follow suit. CHina is the only country with the type of capital controls they try to put in place, with good reason. But eventually even those will be relaxed.
I'm a long term hodler, and I don't even expect to *touch* my core holdings for another 10 years (unless one of the cryptos I own looks like it may actually be replaced by a better one). So you and I are pretty much in the same boat, methinks. :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:31:00
Wait.... It's not?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:42:44
There has been no formal information of a ban. Just reactionary stuff from Chinese exchanges. While I don't disagree with your sentiment, the reality is that what is most likely to happen is that China will announce some regulations to protect consumers and their investments, with will formalize crypto trading.
This will be a *good* thing for cryptos, an dsomething the US is also doing. This is FUD selling, as we've seen multiple times in the past, and for those of us who understand it, it's usually a buy opportunity.
I'm not sure why people continue to perpetuate the "ban" rumour, but it is so unlikely that we should keep talking about it. Regulation will actually be good thing for the markets, and I welcome it. But I am getting tired of people saying "ban" when the Chinese government has made absolutely no mention of doing this. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:43:07
I've been in finance since the early 90's. I'm a fund manager who has always been *very* tech-centric. I've done pretty well in the technology sector for one very good reason. I understand tech, generally, and can actually see use cases projecting out far into the future. Most of my colleagues (the ones who do not grok technology) have, fro decades, pooh-poohed many of my predictions, purchase decisions, and general outlook in the technology industry. Their limited minds just do not understand anything outside traditional financial instruments and traditional markets. This is also why I out-perform them. 
I got into so many industries before they were big (i'm not saying that to be a hipster, just to point out that those of us who actually understand technology always get in early). People like Jamie Dimon are quite literally incapable of understanding the ramifications of technologies that represent a sea-change with regard to the greater world. It also scares them. He certainly has people working for him who *do* understand Bitcoin and crypto in general, but when the powers that be do not understand something, it's a *really* hard sell. This i what we're seeing.
You are correct. History is chock full of people like Dimon, and the world still is. But those of us who were able to get into crypro back in 2010 or thereabouts will so have much more sway over the Dimon's of the world.

I'm an economist (by academics, I'm a fund manager). I work in finance. And I was mining Bitcoin in 2010 and continue to buy on dips.
That's my background in terms of Bitcoin. I won't write a novel, but I wanted to say that opinion pieces like this are incorrect for one (among other) huge reason. Bitcoin has moved beyond a "medium of exchange."
People are always looking for a safe haven, a flight to safety, and a hedge against risk. Like it or not, Bitcoin has proven to be one. Gold was always the big one. But as a store of value, bitcoin has been used for a few years now as a limited hedge, and more recently as a successful one. There *is* no perfect hedge. Gold has moved significantly over the decades. Bitcoin will too. But in the digital world, there is no question that people around the world are using Bitcoin as a hedge against currency, and even other hedges (gold). I used to buy gold. But you can't eat gold, and the only "collapse" scenarios where gold might actually be used are ones where it actually won't be used (you can't eat it). By the same token, Bitcoin serves the same purpose with one exception. it is significantly easier to use (with new technologies) and it is in the control of the holder, unlike physical gold or gold shares.
It is my opinion that people like the author are not technologically inclined and can't see it big picture. In our world, the 21st century, Bitcoin is *the perfect* store of value and hedge, much better than gold, and for this reason it is here to stay. And it will *continue* to steal share from gold. Some traditionalists and conservative investors refuse to see this. And that's fine, let them use gold. But everyone I know who understands technology and the modern world has moved to Bitcoin.

Models are being developed as we speak. All traders, fund managers, etc have models that have been developed over decades, if not centuries, which helps them with securities, bonds, etc. Quants have taken those models to the next level.
People (myself included) are developing models for the crypto markets ass we speak, and as it's such a new world to invest in, modeling is very new, but fortunately we don't have to start from scratch. I personally have models I use that have made me a very successful crypto trader, and others have done (and continue to do) as well. It's actually a *really* exciting time as this is a whole new market to explore, and it's constantly changing, which keeps it fun.

While I agree, what I was implying is that they missed out on the "easy money" and massive gains at the beginning, from 2010 until now. We'll never see gains like that again, even if BTC goes to $100,000. ;)

I somewhat agree with your point, but you have to remember that human psychology is very complex, and over-reactions are common, and also, regardless of the anarchist ideas of the origins of crypto, there has never been a guarantee that crypto was an immutable store of value that couldn't be influenced by states and governments. The NY state Bitcoin License was the first great example of this.
Remember that nothing is stable, including fiat currencies. There is no promise that cryptos will even succeed, so your uncertainty is valid, but if you have concerns about their future, you probably shouldn't be involved. Those of us who *do* have confidence in the long term proposition will continue to participate. I'll buy your Bitcoin at current prices if you desire to sell them, though. ;)

This is sort of correct, however as long as your OM includes the prerogative of risky investments, it's perfectly fine to invest in crypto in the fund. You should see some of the investments I've made in my funds over the years  that had nothing to do with traditional markets. And remember, we often manage many funds, some risky, some market-neutral, and some conservative. It's all about what one offers, and crypto is getting more common. 
Source: I'm a hedge fund manager and I've invested in lots of seemingly odd vehicles over the past 25 years. That's the purpose of hedge funds, to allow a more diverse investment option to select clients to allow greater returns.

There's ICOs and trading around core positions to achieve higher returns than just "buy and hodl." For the average person I suggest doing that, but everyone in finance who is interested is working on new models for the crypto markets to better understand how they trade, and maximize gains. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:50:05
I work in finance (Wall Street). It's pretty much understood that these investment banks are criminal organizations, and a "necessary evil" that should actually be stopped immediately. Dimon and others are very scared of cyrpto, and with good reason. If I have my way, ICOs will eventually be the new underwriting technique and we can accomplish two things:
1. Put the investment banks out of business (a pipe dream, yes, but one I cling to)
2. Even the playing field for IPOs (ICOs) so that it's not just the "pay to play" people who benefit from these investments, but I'd like to see average people able to take advantage of opportunities when companies go public or sell more shares to the public. It's a rigged game right now, and crypto (in the form of ICOs) could end that one day.

Until the volatility issue is addressed, I don't see this happening. And for that to happen, BTW will have to have a much higher notional value. I don't think it will happen any time soon as credit card companies won't want to sit on a hoard of Bitcoin waiting for sales to clear.

To be fair, Buffett has said multiple times that he does not understand technology, which is why he doesn't invest in it. While he may have an opinion that cryptos are a "mirage," it's just his opinion, and not relevant to the reality of the crypto industry. He admits he's just guessing when it comes to technology, and doesn't know shit.
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:33:58

True. But one thing bankers have on their side is their technology groups (IT staff). If you are a programmer you may have ideas about Bitcoin that can slip their way up the food chain. A friend of mine is a developer for a big bank and developed a system of valuing CMOs in a way that really helped their department, so it's just a matter if they are able to utilize their people the right way.

I think you are missing the point. Of course they didn't invent any of the existing Bitcoin-related technology and they hopefully wont encounter a luddite patent reviewer who mistakenly grants them a patent on something that has been open source for years.
However any *new* technology that Coinbase develops that related to Bitcoin is legally and ethically patentable. And they would be stupid not to, from a business perspective, even though personally I would prefer they allow free use of any patents they are granted.
There is a lot of knee-jerk reactionary comments to patents from people who do not understand the way patents work. This includes writers for internet news sites.

This is my pipe dream. I've been in finance my whole life and started my first hedge fund when I was 22.

Speaking as an ex-banker... yes. Plus, its a world of "yes men" and while risk can really pay off, it's hard to introduce concepts that are way outside the knowledge area and skill set of the existing executives/partners. They understand the math part of Bitcoin, but not the technology part of it, but know that it poses some kind of potential threat. It's a hard sell to develop new strategies for disruptive technologies and how to effectively exploit them.

Do you realize how many patents exist that are based upon previous works? You couldn't even count them. That's the way businesses operate. Microsoft could still hold key patents in Windows even though computer operating systems had previously existed.
While I'd like to see Coinbase open up any actual *new* developments to the public, they are running a business and have every right to have any technology that they develop patented. Of course most of what they currently do can't be patented, and I think it's as stupid as you do that they are actually trying to file some of the patents that they are. Almost everything in that list already existed as open source, but if they come up with great new ways to use bitcoin then they have every right to patent it. Right now this sector is a land grab, and they are doing every thing they can to stake their claim. I would too. And unless you are independently wealthy and don't care about income, you would too if you started that business.

Absolutely. Patent games are ridiculous and the entire system needs to be completely fixed.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:43:39
I may not have articulated it particularly well, but that's exactly what I was saying. It's ridiculous to patent what is clearly prior art, but anything Coinbase develops to further enhance their business, which involved Bitcoin, is legally and ethically patentable. 
I would prefer that they open all their patents as I personally prefer the open source community and am a backer of Bitcoin and the technologies that are growing around it, but I was merely pointing out that people saying patents are evil and bad, and Coinbase shouldn't do it do not understand the way US businesses work.

You are missing the point. I never claimed they should be able to patent any of the work, IP, or technology that is behind Bitcoin. 
I am saying that they have a legal and ethical right to patent any *personally developed technology or IP* that they use to add services and capabilities to the Bitcoin network.

Of course it is. It's one of the last unregulated assets with significant capital flows. Institutional markets would be *stupid* to not be manipulating it until it's as regulated as public equity markets and is harder to manipulate. I'm not condoning it, but it's been obvious for quite some time.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:59:52
I'll probably be downvoted for saying this, but they are trying to run a business and there is nothing wrong with patenting or trademarking *new ideas, systems, platforms, etc* (but obviously not the existing ones that they did not create). How is this different than *any* of the tens of thousands of businesses that are run right now across the world? It's not just normal behaviour, it's the best way to have an edge on your competitors. Jeez, this is really getting out of hand.
Now that said, I am personally very bullish on bitcoin and am sitting on a large hoard, and used to mine, so I understand the community and would personally like them to see Coinbase open up their patents the way Tesla did too. But they have no ethical or moral obligation to. They run a business, people. I don't blame them.
They will also not be able to patent key aspects where there is prior art, so all the key aspects of bitcoin technology will be safe, and they will only be allowed to patent technology that the business itself truly develops (so I wouldn't expect them to get a patent on a tip button or a personal vault, for example, and if they do, it will be challenged immediately and likely nullified).
tl;dr I personally wish they would open their patents for free like the rest of the anarcho-capitalists here but it's a sensible business decision.

This is one of the many reasons that I'm bummed that many (though not all) people refuse to understand why I believe Bitcoin will never *replace* credit cards. Bitcoin is like a *debit* card (as states below this in a way). 
Credit cards will always have their place and will not be killed by Bitcoin (though those companies may utilize Bitcoin to increase margins on transfers in the future). But each platform has it's own pros and cons, and will each have their own place going forward.
Keep in mind:
1. You must already have Bitcoin to spend Bitcoin (presently).
2. You do not need to have cash in order to use a credit card, the point is that it is *credit*.
So each has it's own awesome characteristics when used responsibly. I like the idea of a world where thew work in parallel. And there is no reason we cannot imagine a world where they do. So many people seem to forget this, and while I personally hate credit cards and rarely use them, they have come in handy for me many times, and will continue to do so. Unless a company that uses Bitcoin in the same way as a credit card does, and is able to offer he same benefits that Mastercard and Visa do, I will continue to use both depending on the circumstances.

Hey! Swede here, and while I've been involved in Bitcoin for about 4 years, I've been buying them like crazy over the past few months, which, at least in the short term has benefited me greatly (with the price going up). However I do worry about the volatility, as now a very significant portion of my cash is no longer in American Dollars, Euros, or Kronor. 
I'm quite nervous having this much Bitcoin, but many of my friends have started to do the same, so it's not unknown. But it's also not as secure as some other stores of value, so it makes anyone non-techie nervous.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very bullish and have a lot of Bitcoin on cold wallets, but to say that it will *replace* gold is silly. It will be used *in addition* to gold, IMHO.

100% gain is correct. The IRS treats cryptos the same as any asset, e.g. stocks. If you receive some stock (or bitcoin or other coin) for free due to any given circumstance, your cost base is zero. so you are responsible for gains on sale (taxable event).
*Plus*, if it is a short term gain, you pay your normal tax rate on any gain rather that the capital gain number. Something to think about.
This is, of course, if you are as US citizen or living in the US.

I will tell you one honest truth about why this is happening with more frequency now. I can say this as I work in the financial field (hedge fund) and have come to learn a few things.
Bitcoin has been interesting for a while in the financial industry, however it was too new and risky to be adopted by fund managers and financial service companies, so we all watched to see if it was real. As it began to look more *real* (for lack of a better word) it was still to risky to use client money on, but we (fund managers and others in the Wall Street arena) started participating on a personal level, and have made staggering returns.
Now that we are reaching a point where the next "big thing" is cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, and we've spent 2 years buying positions ourselves, our analysts and some managers are starting to talk publicly about how "awesome everything is going to be." If these predictions come true, we, and eventually our clients will stand to make a massive amount of money. Talking it up now is  only going to increase our returns, and, if all goes well, when prices are less volatile, allow us to utilize client money to participate in the crypto market.
This isn't the only reason, but it is one large factor.
td;dr: Wall Street managers now finally own a lot of bitcoin personally, so it is to our advantage for analysts to finally start talking up bitcoin. Now is the time where we see it starting to increase.

I'm the same. I have a 10 year horizon as well, so I'm fine weathering the ups and downs, though I do like to buy the dips, and if I can buy at or below $3K in the next few weeks or months (there will be downward pressure from China still until the price recovers enough for mining to be profitable) I'll be pretty happy. But as someone who has been working in finance for decades, I've learned to put my emotions in check and watch the market (whatever market I'm eyeballing), and this market is still telling me that it's a risky buy today. But all these articles claiming that BTC is dying are patently ridiculous, so even if someone buys here I do personally believe you'll be a very happy camper in 5-10 years, if you can weather it.

I'min finance and I've noticed how closely the crypoto markets have been pairing with the general markets for a while now. I believe they will decouple at some point, but that may be 10 years away, so the coming recession is definitely my greatest concern. Crypto could actually start to become a real store of value and do *well* during the recession, but it also may not, so it's anybody's guess right now. It's pretty fun trying to figure out, though, and I will probably assume some sort of position early 2019 if I have confidence (as I liquidated 95% of my coins a few months ago). :)

There are some of us who are simply mining bitcoins to have them, and are not concerned with anonymity. While you are absolutely right with your concern if you are actively seeking anonymity, but for most of us I presume this is a non-issue.
Now that said, diversity is always a good thing, particularly if sites get hacked (if you wallet is online) and other potential disasters, so spreading them out is not a bad thing in general.

I believe a correction was necessary, and weeds out the weaker holders. I'm expecting this to continue for a while, a few weeks perhaps and then things should stabilize. I'm happy as I see this as a buying opportunity so I'm picking off coins at a discount to future value.

People really need to stop spreading the myth that the situation in Cyprus had anything to do with the rise in value. Cypriots are not buying bitcoins. The price went up due to speculation and more awareness. It is a volatile commodity and will keep going up and down, but Cypriots are the last people who have been buying bitcoins lately, it's all North Americans and Europeans that have access to liquid assets, not people in Cyprus.

I disagree. I sent them a word of advice about communicating with customers. The issue is not that they require additional forms of payment to protect themselves from fraud, that I *completely* understand, it is the lack of communication and the lack of options that will drive people like me to other services. 
They can do whatever they want, it's their company. But sneaking new requirements in without telling people, and not allowing other credit cards (even with a higher fee) is ridiculous.

Absolutely. But there were rampant claims that Cypriots were fleeing to security by buying bitcoins. That particular myth was the one that I'm sick of seeing perpetuated.

I'm not sure what that is, but do I see over 2 bitcoins in that wallet somehow? I can guarantee that's not mine, though I'm intelligent and well read enough to realize that transfers are traceable. I've never had that many bitcoins, so I'm not sure what that even is. I don't even use blockchain.info.

I'm not worried, but if *you* are, get out of Bitcoin. Don't take risks with your money that you don't feel comfortable making. If you have confidence that your BTC are safe, and you understand how to protect yourself, I don't believe you have anything to worry about.

If Cypriots can't even get their money out of banks, how are they going to be buying bitcoins? There aren't Bitcoin ATMs. The only people buying bitcoins right now are tech-savvy people. I'm not saying that Cypriots aren't tech savvy, but the likelihood that there are enough tech-savvy Cypriots, that all have access to cash, are all buying bitcoins like crazy to create this bubble, is pretty darn small.
Occam's razor says it's speculation by tech-savvy people with ready access to cash, not a nation of people who have other worries right now.

It's not even a question of market cap. It's more about liquidity. If I start a buy side fund with $25 million dollars, Goldman won't bat an eyelash at me. But when there is enough liquidity, which I admit *does* tie in with a market cap, they will start to take notice. 
But there remains the question of will they crush it or will they adapt and invest? I believe both will take place. Mastercard will lobby to crush Bitcoin. Broker dealers and investment banks that think they can control it will invest.  However it does the big IBanks no good to own it all, as they need liquidity to redeem their gains. Of course they could use inflated values as leverage, so there is that. But I'm looking at both arbitrage, which is more about liquidity than market cap, and investment second, which *is* market cap related. At some point there will be big scandals when the IBanks attempt to manipulate the market, but it's not as easy with Bitcoins as it is with equities, bonds, derivatives, etc.
But it's tough to say when the big guys will care, but I can tell you that a lot of guys I know own a *lot* of Bitcoins personally, because they see a good investment. When they get involved personally is when the savvy bankers, who understand technology (and there aren't a lot of them) truly understand the nature of the beast. When they have shown a proof of concept, with proper back testing, they will get involved. But $10 million in gains is nothing to the big banks. When they can make $100s of millions, they will jump in. But when they see the smaller funds making money hand over fist (if you can find the right API &amp; algorithms) then they will start to take notice. That's what my friends and I are working on now. It's basically quant/arbitrage. We all own Bitcoins and will seed with our own capital (Bitcoins) and seek additional capital when we can show performance.

The tech savvy in the financial industry are going to take over Bitcoin almost entirely.

It's amazing how popular it's getting, but mostly in the conversational sense. 
Those of us who understand how it works will benefit far greater than the JP Morgans of the world. Don't get me wrong, they will too, but we, the early adopters, will kick it off and probably just be bought out when we want.

Very true. Of course, every commodity in the US is *also* exchanged for USD, whether it is bread, bitcoins, or bullets, so that argument is not correct. The US government is scared of a virtual system of exchange they can't control and are trying to sow FUD. This is just the beginning.

Well, as in the interview, they can't kill bitcoin, but they can regulate it's use. And we all know who drafts legislation (and it' snot the legislators). We'll see how it all unfolds, but the interesting thing is that wall street can profit from Bitcoin no matter what happens. I owned things in my hedge fund that would defy logic, restaurants, and other opportunities in addition to the equities I bought for investment purposes. As long as the language of your OM allows it, you may invest in anything you want. The big banks operate the same way. The US may regulate the use of Bitcoin for its citizens' purchases, but as an investment vehicle, they won't regulate the buying and selling of bitcoins, so no matter what happens, if you have the money, you will win. 
I hate to say this out loud, but it's why I'm so glad I'm a technology guy and got in really early. I can start a fund with my BTC and my partners' Bitcoins and we're set. No matter what happens we can make it work. Of course we nee to find the right trading algorithms, markets, and continue to refine our process, but the BIG opportunity will be over the next 10 years. I'm looking forward to the intellectual challenge and am very excited, and I'd love to do everything I can to stop asshats from passing legislation from being passed that restricts its use. I actually hate big banks and the fed, even if I need the banks as a prime broker. It's why I left finance in the first place. I loved the business, but hated the people.

Any merchant in the US lets you trade a product for USD. Bitcoins are just another commodity, though better termed a proxy commodity for fiat currencies. I understand what you are saying, and you are welcome to your opinion, but I disagree with it. The US cannot control Bitcoins, so they are trying to attack everything related to is. Mt Gox is just the tip of the iceberg, and the US ignores laws that it doesn't like. You should look at the laws regarding precious metals, they are *very* different than currency laws, and I know this because I started a precious metal broker/dealer service. Bitcoins are no different than gold and silver as a commodity, not a currency, but the US government is so afraid of it's adoption that they are ramping up the attack. It will just get worse, and we need to fight back (legally).

I don't have high end gaming rigs, so I'm getting about 200 Mhash/s with one, and close to 10 each with the other two. So yeah, seriously underpowered CPU mining. But as previously stated, I'm not doing the mining right now to get rich mining bitcoins, merely to see if I can get 1 BTC this way. After I get to 1 in my wallet, I won't be mining anymore as it's obviously not cost effective. But I *would* like to think of a better way to acquire more bitcoins.

And in addition, LEOs can use violence and terrorism and other illegal acts in order to trap others. the notion of "entrapment' is mostly an urban legend, and police, etc, and engage in a lot of stuff you would never believe. I know this first hand as I worked with a LEO to catch a particularly nasty perp and every time I asked "can you really do that, isn't it illegal" he just smiled and said, "yep, we can do it, no problem." It's pretty scary what they are allowed to do to catch people.

It's interesting that none of these commentators bring up the notion that this could replace a lot of the third party transactional systems, and in fact, make them unnecessary.

I agree with a lot of that, but people who see their money at risk, not just Cypriots, are not going to jump int something as risky as Bitcoins, an extremely risky commodity, to preserve capital. So personally, I feel it was merely a timing thing with more tech-savvy individuals willing to take a risk with Bitcoins, coupled with a lot of speculation and more bitcoin related news on the Interwebz. I'm not saying that your theory can't be right, but just that mine seems more plausible (to me).

My only issue with this is that, while I have no problem with them charging my credit card every month, would you ever give a company access to draw from your Bitcoin wallet at will? It's one of the big things separating fiat currency/credit cards from BTC.
Obviously you could have a special wallet your fill yourself with only a low amount, but then you may as well just manually pay every month. Credit card billing is sooooooo easy.

You as a person don't get it. I was not making a judgement about you, or people who use Paypal. I personally would like to see it die. I would like to see Bitcoin thrive. Don't take my comments personally just because you use Paypal. I still think Bitcoin has greater advantages, as well as some weaknesses (that could possibly be shored up). 
I don't like Paypal. I would like to donate Bitcoin to Wikipedia. I don't want Paypal to take the kind of cut that they require. Micro-transactions should only require micro-fees. It's how I see things. You don't have to agree with it, but don't give me shit just because I have a different opinion. That just makes you look closed minded and ignorant.

Yep..... Bitcoin has it's place, and I believe it will eventually increase in value even from this level, but there are some things it will never be good for, from a safety/security perspective.

Not until the exchange rate for USD is much higher. There are people who are sitting on Bitcoins as they expect it to increase in value and are willing to wait longer term. At some point would I use this service? perhaps. Soon? no.
