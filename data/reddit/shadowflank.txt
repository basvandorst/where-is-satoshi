I have traded via with Phil and can confirm his legitimacy. Well, privately. I don't have rep in SGS.
Take my opinion as you will, but I'm also not a random lurker. I have a reputation established in r/loans and r/playitforward.

When was this posted because I did not see it the past few days I've looked.
Nor when I checked before posting this link. edit*

BFL. Hands down.

Bitlots. Uniden/Polaroid 4'inch tablet, its actually 50-55 bucks now.
It's made by Southern Telecom, and really isn't that bad of a tablet. 1GHz A8 Cortex and 512mb of ram. It's got a Mali 400 for graphics, the resolution of it is pretty crappy but it still runs pretty much anything.
I recently decided to dualboot CM10 on my TouchPad, so all that little feller is now is a Bitcoin safe.

Only link I have and I haven't really heard of them, but Nasdaq even shared the video that was on Reuters the other day.
Much to my dislike they encourage people to use Mt. Gox.
Why is everyone being so fucking blind about Mt. Gox?

I want one =(

Some schools issue copies to the students in some cases, iirc.

There's a distribution called BitSafe, I don't know if you're aware of it but its a livedistro run off of USB medium. 
From what I've sifted through on this thread, you're a fan of USB keys to implement 'security'.

Are you sure these aren't Satoshi premines?

I have a friend whom was conned out of over a hundred thousand from BFL due to "Computer error".

Typically that 2 dollars an hour is prorated.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:19:02
Perhaps you should add an option to sort price high to low.

Interesting. I think the admin of steambits still owes us an explanation.

Yeah said place is supposidly rooted on the "Chinese Mafia" (The fuck?) and gives the DA a tug regularly.
There's also a law that says you have to report tips to the IRS...
Yeah. Tried doing that and the accountant called informing me he was forging my tip sheet. 
PS. Was never a server there, still got minimalistic cash tips.

This is why I like big-name trading markets starting to announce binary options for Bitcoin.
Fuck Mt.Gox.

I use a 60 dollar Android tablet for my wallet use. Due to its hourlong battery life on wifi, it's mostly kept in offline mode.

I think its entirely plausible and should be investigated before calling Ryan a nutcase.
Mind the landmines.

If you can provide me some link's to verify your legitimacy, I'd be willing to do escrow or if you send the gift first.
I'm established in so you can gauge that for my legitimacy.
I'm quite weary of trading with anyone after getting 60 dollars worth of moneypak and bitcoin threatened hostage yesterday.
EDIT: The game in question is Game of Thrones. 
EDIT2: I'd also be willing to have a trusted middleman from either PiF's moderators or Gameswap moderators.

Better than the exchange who possibly shifts numbers around to get profits.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:50:48
...The place I used to work at did not prorate pay per hour like most places should do or do.
2 dollars per hour, no prorate if your tips suck ass.
So yeah. Its not a bonus everywhere, its more like counteracting shitty employers.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:26:12
My ratio on PiF is 11 - 9, receiving 11, gave 9. I also have an active PiF that has been open (Sadly) for over a month which I just reposted, for four games total. 
Perhaps we can do business, add me on Steam if you will.
EDIT: Any particular person of importance on PiF that has been a member for at least a year should be able to validate my status as not a douchebag. :P
EDIT2: Already did the trade with someone else.

Perhaps if people think it's a good idea to spread the word, leave a cash tip along with the bitcoin tip.
Also depending on if the tipper used a service to create the printout, after one month the bitcoins are returned if the tip goes unused.

With the recent snowballing of development, I wouldn't doubt it'll be there eventually.
Then again, you typically want to hunt for a Linux compatible card before building a Linux-based gaming rig.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:45:02
It is, but you report it, you no longer have a job.
They fire you, and claim angry employee. If the claims they're tied with the 'chinese mafia' and suck off the DA regularly, it's not going to end in anything but you getting laughed at to your face and unemployment.
