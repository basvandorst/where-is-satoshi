A credit card company offers a cash back Visa card, that gives 1.5% cash based on your purchases.  So people, because they are insane in many ways, buy more shit to get that 1.5% reward.
You could do the same thing with the app.  Where the merchant is paying to drive traffic and agrees to payback 5%, 10%, or 15% of all purchases in the specific coin.  (because we'll probably see certain coins drive more traffic than other coins).  You could use Coinbase as an administrator for both the end users to connect their account of "winnings" and the merchants to transfer those coins into those accounts.  For each purchase made, a QR code can be printed on the map, or a spawn event for that user ID can be sent to their device which gives additional rewards, discounts for repeating purchases at the same location, or higher payout locations on the map.
This way the merchant is paying money and getting a return on his revenue.  He's only paying out when customers buy goods.  And instead of just driving traffic for a one time deal, you can offer a plan that keeps those customers coming back and wanting to spend money at his shop for the "cash back" reward.

You're making pretty broad generalizations.
Look, here's the thing, conservatives are conservative.  They typically dont embrace new technologies or trends.  Progressives are more likely to embrace new technologies and be first adopters.   That's why Silicon Valley is near San Francisco.
As far as "love for big government" or "something benevolent about our current monetary system" that's simply a bunch of hogwash.  Democrats were part of Occupy Wall Street and rail against income inequality and the 1%.  Their core issues relate to protection of civil rights and workers rights.  Clearly they arent fans of corporations becoming people with rights that supersede those granted to the individuals.  They dont beleive that big government should control everything, but they do believe government should provide opportunity to all citizens, regulate businesses who abuse their market positions, and provide for the general safety and basic infrastructure needs that allow America to continue being a super power.

Let's be realistic here, game consoles, TV's, computers, space heaters, refrigerators and ovens all consume more energy than bitcoin mining.  The whole argument of "bitcoin is destroying the environment" seems like a bunch of baseless FUD.
There's also the fact any advancing civilization will require more and more energy as it progresses.  If you know anything about the Kardashev scale, bitcoin and the internet would be considered Type 1 civilization infrastructure.

In the game, the items and content define the economy.  What users feel they are worth is the market defining the value.

You’re missing the point. Communism in practice and paper communism are two entirely different things.  North Korea and Cuba are actually more socialist because the state, not the workers, own and control the means of production. 
Bitcoin transfers power back to the workers and citizens and not the elites which is the actual goal of communism in theory.  The one caveat of course being, in true communism there is no money or social classes.  Neither North Korea or Cuba has eliminated money or classism.

If the gaming company attaches provenance and history to each in-game item and tightly controls the distribution and resale of items to make them more rare or unique, they could run a store and auction house and make money facilitating the trade of funds and items in game.  They could also use it to release new items.  They could restrict private trades between players, for instance making the item bind on pickup, but allow them to sell it through the auction house or a private sale where the company gets a cut of that transaction.  Like a provenance fee.
Imagine how cool it would be to buy the very first Thunderfury ever created in WoW and have an entire history of who created it, what raids were completed with it, and then the same thing for each owner.  You're creating a rich history behind these items, a true legacy so to speak and creating value by doing it.

No, two players cant just set up a trade if you've got control of the transfer of items.  You only make it possible though an auction house where the developers collect a fee.  Thats the entire point, by providing scarcity of items and the control and transfer of their ownership in game you can collect the fees.  The game devs are providing the value of provenance to the in-game items.  The buyer is happy, the seller is really happy and the investors are creaming their pants.
You keep forgetting the devs can control how items are transferred between users.  It is in that process that they can collect fees for facilitating the movement of those "scarce" items across some kind of auction house.
Allow players to trade consumables or other trash items, just not the rare items players want and are willing to pay a premium for.  The developers arent limiting the way bitcoin can be used, they are limiting the method by which weapons or other premium items can be transferred between users.

No, it's not a stretch at all.  I'm simply relating the very real concerns expressed by infinitely smarter people who actually develop these systems and protocols.
150mbps is not the average speed in a majority of the developed world.  That suggests mining will be centralized in specific developed nations that have the infrastructure capable of delivering those speeds, not to mention the power requirements.   So, no, the centralization argument is not unbased, you've actually referenced that only a handful of nations have the ability to provide the necessary infrastructure to support it.

Not really, they are then having to manage their in-game currency.
Players are used to in-game currency, but the ability to make money is a value add for players which will create more demand for the game.  The in-game currency isnt going to rise in value like bitcoin is if its being controlled by the devs.  That's why bitcoin being deflationary is a good thing for devs to implement it into their game the value of the transactions will increase over time.
With good coding, you can make the process of setting up a wallet transparent to the player.  The same systems you need to convert fiat to your in-game currency would be the same systems youd use to buy bitcoin or load bitcoin into a lightning channel for in game use.
The fact is 55% of millennial gamers use or own bitcoin.  This is an untapped market.

Remember, customers and new users are conditioned to place trust in third party providers like banks.  There are significant obstacles to trying to buy bitcoin or other crypto through decentralized means which woudl restrict adoption.
The truth is exchanges are a necessary evil right now.  Crypto is still maturing and I'd imagine there will be easier, more decentralized ways to buy and sell bitcoin in the future but at this point removing obstacles and streamlining the process for onboarding new users is critical to mainstreaming the technology.  These centralized exchanges eliminate those obstacles and makes it easier for new users to enter the space.
That's how I started.  Now I move my coins off the exchange to a hardware wallet shortly after purchasing them.  The fact is these third party exchanges do offer a valuable service in facilitating the purchase of crypto.

Auction houses dont imply random loot at all.  One seller is posting his unique item on the auction house, its then matched with a buyer, the transfer of the assets is then performed and the devs take a percentage of the sale.
If users spend their time buying and selling on the auction house to make real money, thats great for devs because they are making a percentage from each transfer.
Blizz shut down the real money auction house because players were playing the auction house and gold farming.  One guy made $130k from real money auctions.  They implemented it poorly and tried to have both real money and in-game gold.  They also couldnt use it for the console platforms.

You design the system so only bitcoin comes in.  Whether that is in high margin fees for new item or content introductions, commission fees for auctions, or micro transaction fees for facilitating other in-game transactions, the whole point is to capture and monetize the value of the in-game economy.   The value add is to have a lot of money moving THROUGH the game and being the intermediary for all those transactions.

Do we need to go back to the beginning of the conversation where we talked about binding items to a blockchain to maintain scarcity, provide provenance for those items and protect against duplication?
The devs would control the distribution of unique items into the game by binding items to a blockchain.  If a player deletes his character those unique assets could then be re-distributed by the game devs in a direct sale.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:11:05
But an in-game currency creates objections and obstacles to players converting real money to your in-game currency.  You can use bitcoin and bypass those obstacles and objections.  You also give the players the ability to profit off their success while still making money facilitating transactions.
You cant offer that with your in-game currency.

Loot boxes are gambling because there’s a probabilistic chance of getting an item.  I didn’t say anything about loot boxes.  I said sell items directly and add auction house.  
You’d sell items directly. 
Each character would also have their own wallet on creation because how else are you going to manage the assets assigned to them?  If you’re tracking each item to protect against duplication those assets are getting assigned to a character (wallet) until they are transferred.

The fact people could earn money on Diablo 2 selling items online drew a ton of people to play for money.  The game itself had to be good, but the draw of making real money brought more players.
Black markets?   Side channels?  Have you not read my posts?  I am describing a system where the dev has full control over the scarcity of items and the transfer of those items and makes a commission by facilitating those trades.  They block users from being able to trade them privately.  The only way to move those items is through an auction house that the devs make a percentage of sales on.  Like Blizzard did originally in Diablo 3.
The game doesnt generate bitcoin.  Bitcoin is simply the medium of exchange between players.  You're matching buyers with sellers and collecting 10-15% on the transaction and managing the provenance of the scare item being exhanged.
That is not gambling, that's simply providing a exchange service.  You might have to register as a money transfer business, but you would probably have to do that by offering your own virtual coin too.

It is a taxable event, you realized the BTC gains and traded them into an alt.  So you need to pay tax on the amount of profit from your purchase price to its selling price.  So if you swapped 1 BTC at $15k to a bunch of Litecoin and had originally bought that BTC at like $1,200, then you need to pay tax on the $13,800 in profit.  You dont need to pay taxes on the Litecoin if you held it and didnt sell or swap it at a profit.
Conversely, if you swapped at a loss, bought BTC at $15K and then swapped it back to Ethereum when BTC was at $10k, then you had a $5k loss you can claim as well and lower the amount of tax you owe.
I got fucked in the ass by this on my taxes because I swapped my BCH fork for BTC and had to pay the taxes on the BCH with a cost basis of $0.

We could have had mass adoption over this last holiday season but the simple fact of the matter is bitcoin isn't ready yet for mainstream adoption.  Not only that, the companies providing the infrastructure that allows retail investors to get involved collapsed under the stress and couldn't onramp that influx of new users.
There will be another opportunity, but the community kind of fell flat on its face when the last opportunity came and went.  People are still hung up awaiting verification from that rush in November and December.  A lot of people were so upset by those fuck ups they were completely turned off to crypto as a result.

That's the thing, you dont randomly generate items.  You cant control their distribution, preserve scarcity or protect against duplication through random generation.  You're tracking those assets in a blockchain.
You clearly dont comprehend what it is I am saying about how the system would be designed.  You've misunderstood or made assumptions about nearly everything, including calling it gambling for some reason.
Having your own in game currency requires a whole new layer of services to manage that in game currency, to convert regular currencies into in-game currency and doesnt give players incentive because they cant make real money.  By controlling the scarcity of items, you're creating an in-game economy and the use of bitcoin or other crypto is simply the medium of exchange with its own infrastructure to manage and secure those transactions.
Less overhead, more profit, more motivation for players to play because theres a tangible reward.

Because its an actual currency that is more liquid, because its deflationary and because it's a draw by itself.  If players can make bitcoin as opposed to some in-game coin that cant be converted back you're giving them more motivation to play.  The ability for the gamer to profit will bring more gamers.

Right now, game consoles use more electricity than bitcoin mining.  So do TVs.  And washers/dryers and dishwashers.  Amazon Echo's use more energy.  That's right, Alexa herself is destroying the planet.  The "high carbon footprint" problem isnt really a problem.
I see cryptos as tools.  You use the best tool for the job.  A crescent wrench can be helpful in a lot of situations, but it doesnt solve the same problems a flathead screwdriver does.  Not every problem needs to be solved with a hammer.  Cryptos will find their niches and people will use them appropriately.  The internet has a bunch of technical jargon, but even goat farmers are connecting to it from a handheld device in the middle of nowhere.  Have you ever tried to have a conversation about auto repair with most women?  Their eyes glaze over in seconds.  You might as well be comparing and contrasting the Seven Seconds or Less offense to the Triangle in basketball.  They still drive cars despite all the technical jargon and inability to fix their own cars.  They will still watch LeBron dunk despite not knowing what a pick and pop play is.
The volatile price wont matter much as cryptos will become mediums of exchange pegged to the local currency spot price.  If its just used as a layer to settle a transaction in a native currency, then its volatility doesnt matter as much.  Businessmen will still think about what the relative value of their product is in terms of local currency.  They wont be trying to figure out how much this thing costs in bitcoin.  They will still be comparing price of bitcoin to price of local currency.  As it matures, the volatility will decrease and smooth out.

The game devs are running their own blockchain to manage the assets and the transfer of items, protecting against duplication of items and maintaining scarcity and provenance for those items.
This isnt quite easy at all.  But you would be leveraging smart contracts and multi-party sigs for transferring items.
Actually, some games do exist where the in game items are tied to the blockchain and you can buy them for crypto.
You're not right, you didnt even understand the basic concept.
