This sub does not claim to be the "uncensored" forum for "Bitcoin" discussion. 
As for the contortist rectal probing, no amount of long-winded asanine bullshit from Roger Ver and Co. can possibly justify using "R/BTC" as a "BCH" subreddit.

Hmm, that makes sense. It is not about instant gratification or immediate gains, but more about investing in what you believe in and seeing where the tide goes as you strive to support the ship. I can respect that.
And, it is true, the markets are heavily manipulated. Still, if an average user is not inclined to buy BCH at higher prices, than what they spent previously to obtain it, then their collective unwillingness, which is completely understandable, would be of greater influence than whales that are unable to unload their bags otherwise. Furthermore, believing that onboarding more people would resolve this issue, seems more of the vein of a pyramid scheme. Not that it is, just that the argument could be made. Then again, it is fundamentally people that determine value. So perhaps this argument falls flat in the end.
Still, I do agree with the sentiment regarding the technology and the potential it carries to be a significant game changer for the status quo. 
The freedom and risk of being in control of our own wealth is exhilarating. In retrospect, it seems strange that we even have to fight for it. Yet, that is how the world is currently. In truth, it may not even be Bitcoin or the forks therein that unshackles the banker's chains. But, pandora's box has been opened, the code is open sourced, and there are 10s of millions of programmers. In time, something will prevail against the odds.
Ah, my apologies, got a bit whimsical there. Anyway, the user experience and perception of the space has a long way to go. I suppose one of the simplest ways to achieve faster adoption would be to spread the crypto wealth and let people experience it directly. But, such would have to be done in person. As, ironically, doing it pseudo anonymously over the internet would be foolish. Yet, that carries a very real personal risk. I get that the merchant onboarding and other such approaches by BCH supporters are geared in that direction. But, the internet remembers and the antics of Roger and his team, as well as using r/btc as the BCH subreddit, greatly undermines the cause and makes it come off as disengenious and scamy. In truth, I would have no issue with BCH, otherwise. As there are several crypto projects, outside of Bitcoin, that I am interested in.

All good, and of course, never take anything at face value, especially when there is a clear and obvious bias ��
@_date: 2019-10-23 02:29:13
Consider for a moment that you knew that r/btc is the BCH subreddit and you will understand why we cannot coexist. 
The code is innocent and different approaches should be celebrated/discussed/scrutinized. 
I admit that r/Bitcoin is not such a place. Yet, it is for Bitcoin discussion and makes no claims to being uncensored. And, r/btc, despite claiming to be the uncensored forum for all Bitcoin/Forks discussion, only upvotes posts/comments which support BCH or Roger's investments and will downvote/censor (although they call it "moderation":   anything not related, factually contradictory, or otherwise opposed to Roger's investments.
In any case, when your sole marketing tactic is to usurp the name of your competitor (r/btc, bitcoin.com) to promote your products (aka. Roger Ver) while taking daily deceptive potshots against that competitor/developments/supporters. 
Then, ask yourself, except as an insurance against the entirety of the internet going blind and forgetting the shit that bastard did and does, would you want anything to do with the other side?

First paragraph: ��‍♂️
Okay, I confess that my example was off. But, even if you are replacing immediately after you spend the BCH. If you spent 1 BCH are you wanting to PAY MORE for that 1 BCH or spend the same or less than what you bought that 1 BCH prior for. It is not a valid strategy. It is still fundamentally inclined to lead to lower and lower value for BCH.
Likewise, you are entitled to your own opinion as well. But, I also find LN suits my needs quite well. And, I also find that there are many pitfalls to BCH, which I need not elaborate upon because it has all been said and discussed.
I find the complicated part to be highly suspect and strongly disagree. Frankly, it sounds like an argument made by Buttcoiners or from those refusing to actually try and claiming it to be too complex. But, I can respect that you go with what you trust and believe in as well.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:04:47
You act as though Roger, amongst others, never did the same. Repeatedly. Without End. For Two Bloody Years.
Seriously, Fuck Off with that Bullshit. And, nice job pandering to your fellow B-CH Shills.
I am replying to you here instead of your post in r/btc because David Shares is a cunt. "Moderation" indeed.
The whole bloody lot of you are disgusting hypocrites.
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:22:13
r/Bitcoin does not claim to be "uncensored" and r/btc, despite the blasted name and claims of being for ALL Bitcoin discussion, is obviously and clearly only for the promotion of Roger's favorite sales pitch and products. To claim otherwise is completely disengenious and to say it is the result of "free speech" is complete and utter tripe.
As to the difficulty and problems of LN. Are you serious? How long will your side keep that lie going. 
I will not deny that there was a serious bug uncovered not too long ago. But, though it was not addressed or patched IMMEDIATELY, as those in your partially decentralized camp would prefer. It was not quite the "Ha, we told you LN is a broken POS" that Roger's employees, like David Shares, would choose to believe.
I have had no serious issues with LN myself and I have been using it periodically for almost a year. Certainly there is room for improvement. But, the speed and cost of transactions is not something that a lazy on chain solution can provide securely without relying on 0-confirmations. Frankly, if that is your gambit, your side may as well abandon proof of work altogether, go full on smart contract, and trust in the guaranteed 6 month updates from Roger to keep your Altcoin floating. 
Also, while you are here, mind explaining the whole rubbish with spend and replace. Let's say I bought 10 BCH and spent it across a week. I go back to the exchange, or let's face it Roger's Bitcoin.com, and want to refill it. On buying those 10 BCH what do you think the intrinsic mindset is going to be. Especially for the poor, dying babies, part of the world. Am I going to be thrilled to buy back 10 BCH for more than what I spent prior. Or, do I want to see the value of BCH to be the same or lower than a week prior?
Your coin mocks hodlers and promotes spend and replace as doctrine. But, from my perspective, spend and replace is intrinsically inclined to lead to persistently lower values for BCH. Now you might say that buying from exchanges is not the only way. Sure, you can pray for random donations of SPICE or some BCH saint to just hands it out like cheap candy on Halloween. Or maybe mine your own, which is totally something poorer folk can afford to do. Or, maybe gamble your BCH and strike it rich. Or, maybe advertise as a BCH friendly business, like giving legitimate donations to the poor, and have rich BCH supporters give their BCH to you. All brilliant and viable options for the global market. But, do tell if I missed something. I am genuinely curious as to how spend and replace is such a good and viable philosophy. 
As opposed to trying to become a store of value first, like Gold. Then using secondary and side layers to facilitate daily transactions, like Cash. And, though LN is just one such solution, it is still far more successful, far more capable, and far less expensive, than anything BCH could provide, no matter how badly it compromises itself.

Why, hello Roger's Roger! How nice to see a reminder on why you fellows were "censored", or "moderated" as you like to call it in r/btc when your hypocritical mods do the same, for being the disengenious Rogers that you are. 
Truly, not a shred of shilling or promoting a false narrative to be seen at all...
Oh! So, how is Roger's Coin doing? Poor thing has taken quite the nose dive over the past two years, no? 
It really is a shame that despite Roger's persistent and brilliant marketing/propaganda campaign, which is not in the least bit insane or asinine and has clearly been successful, that B-CH is not worth more than a damn.
So, quick question for a Roger's Roger, Roger has recently stated that B-CH can go up by 1000% or something. Tell me, oh wise and learned follower of the Roger. Why the Roger should I spend it or use it as cash in that case? Can you imagine buying a coffee and the next instant that 1 dollar cup goes to 1000? Truly, Roger's is a mind that operates 3D Chess better than Trump.
Godspeed, Roger's Roger. Godspeed.

It was as clever as his cheap attempt to get yet another post on the "I was censored on r/Bitcoin" for r/btc.
Seriously, if BCH had any real intention to become top dog, through adoption and inclusion of new people, who honestly would find the censorship justification to be an excuse of the vein of SJWs, they would not squat on BTC's name for their reddit. Instead, they would use r/BCH and would do so proudly. But, no still squatting on r/BTC. Still, using the same lame propaganda bullshit over and over, while BCH price continues to fall in the gutter. The fact that your echo chamber fails to see how badly this behavior undermines any legitimate attempt to gain global support boggles the mind.
Also, the fees being too expensive is a bit of a stretch nowadays, don't you think? I've seen Egon's posts, hard to miss them, and honestly they do little to convince me otherwise. More a sad attempt at grasping at straws, especially with LN and other developments/prospects in Bitcoin. 
I also see little point in using 0-confirmations, you may as well switch to smart contracts. In which case, LN has already beat you guys to the punch. 
Now, do I think LN is the solution to all small scale transactions? No. But, I do think it is a far wiser approach to try and develop side chains and drive chains than try to clump everything onto the main chain to fulfill every need, when it obviously cannot. 
Frankly, BCH cannot handle global level transactions, even if they increased the blocksize substantially. It would fail to do so and at that point, given the size of the nodes required, you may as well just stick to fiat for how centralized it would become.
But, don't get me wrong, I do not hate BCH as the code is not at fault. What I despise are the failing  tactics used to promote it, by a man with neither shame or integrity.
