I'm having trouble with them too...
I put in a trade and it's been pending for about 30 minutes.
CAvirtex has been buggy and slow as hell over the last few days - has anyone else experienced this?

Thanks for that, helpful.  Hopefully their coming financials will reveal some of the questions we need answering

Disclosure: I'm a bitcoin believer.
I think the economic, regulatory, etc. arguments in this thread are really the 2nd hurdle.
The primary hurdle to widespread adoption is the sheer complexity of using Bitcoin and keeping it safe.  This is not something that an average person can easily understand, and that's a big problem because the only way to really trust Bitcoin is to understand how it works.
With cash, you don't need to teach someone how keep cash safe or how to spend it, it's obvious and tied to our current conceptual map of property.  Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in understanding property and security in the digital age.
Bitcoin needs to be understood by regular people in order to be widely adopted.  There is nothing more important.

Hey, thanks for the response.  I tried that but it's not working... the concerning part is that the deposit isn't even showing up as a pending deposit.  
It's like they didn't even see the transaction in the blockchain (usually as soon as it's transmitted you can see the pending deposit and see the confirmation count increase)...  I've opened a ticket but this is pretty weird.  Also, their site is uber slow right now I am wondering if something else is up...
