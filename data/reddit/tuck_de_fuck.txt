Right now I'd go with the BTC because it's so low but usually I'd go with cash just for it's solid value.

Accepting LTC? That's pretty awesome, especially from the beginning. Any chance of other alt coins?
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:55:44
No but they could perform a 51% attack which would break the network. The protocol would still exist, but it would be unusable.

Well I hope I have good antivirus in that case.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:15:41
Awesome thanks! How do I accept it?
Edit: Never mind it PMd me.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:30:18
No offense, but that seems like a horrible idea. You should never invest in only 1 thing, let alone your life savings. But nevertheless, best of luck to you.

That's a pretty cool and interesting way to boost both donations AND interest in Bitcoin. Have you gotten many responses because of it?
Edit: I Just realized that you xposted it from [here]( Still a nice find. I'll xpost my comment to that.

I've already got it checked. About how big is the file that I'm downloading?
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:53:02
Ok thanks again. I posted on bitcointalk hoping for some more feedback.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:28:53
I've had bitcoin open for the last couple days thinking that was the problem but I figured it was something else. Is there a way to speed up the synchronization? I have 1mb/s download speed but I didn't think it'd be that slow. It's still going just really slowly.

For one, money/electricity isn't an issue; I'm simply experimenting with mining and transactions. Also, is there a way to limit the CPU usage?
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:57:02
Sweet jesus... that's probably why it's taking so long...
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:32:12
No... No you wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:40:54
Ok I guess I'll just wait it out. Thanks for the help. You too @_date: 2013-12-03 08:19:14
Oh ok that's awesome actually. Thanks for the help. Is there a specific one you'd recommend? I'm checking out Phoenix Miner now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:33:47
Ok I really hate to bother you again, but I've been [watching this instal video]( and I don't get where he's getting the filename for the batch file from. Any guesses?
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:39:41
It's only stupid if you aren't downloading from a reputable site. Most common sites have a decent comments section, and trusted private tracker sites are even better.
@_date: 2013-03-10 21:46:34
Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:24:49
I'm pretty surprised they haven't already. They seem like a pretty good couple.
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:21:23
I'd like to see a source on that hpshout.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:34:26
What I meant by it is that it'll be difficult, if not impossible, for someone else to forcibly devalue the USD value. It could surely happen economically but that would also possibly affect cryptocurrencies as well. Just a guess, I'm far from an economic expert.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:38:19
Congrats and best of luck. I'm still waiting to buy in!
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:34:35
It has a nation backing it. Bitcoin is great, but between a powerful computer infrastructure and a powerful military country, I think the USD has a little more backing it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:41:55
A good point, but I'm taking my chances and hoping that it will dip down some.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:13:41
If I understand it, GUI using graphics cards and I'm just using my laptop. So I think a CPU miner would work best? I really don't know much about this. I'm not trying to get rich at all, just experiment with mining.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:27:51
I got it all sent and everything! Thank's for the tip :)
