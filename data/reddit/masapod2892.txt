I'm amazed on how that much money is being stored in a location excluding a swiss bank. I don't remember where I first saw those photos. I just searched google for piles of cash.

I was puzzled when it first came out took me forever to learn how to mine it with a laptop. Yeah I was there even before it was worth $5. I'm not to sure if I was in the mailing list I got to check old email account ( never deleted anything ) over 10k+ email.

I have used many digital currency (I personally don't like calling it cryptocoins because everyone thinks of buying drugs first) bitcoins, litecoins, many other altscoins, and dogecoins. I think that we all should collaborate together. like how I view it has B=$100 L=$50 D=$20 (D=D) all are somehow similar. I feel personally if we collaborate closer we can make a positive impact faster.

Heck I can't agree more since I found out about bitcoin in 2008 (wish I invested heavily into it) then litecoin and now dogecoin I can now say nothing is impossible. I use all 3 mentioned above, in a sense all are somewhat similar, if we all work together instead of hating each other we can make a huge difference in the young rapidly evolving sector of digital currency

I got scammed when buying hardware with bitcoins (2btc) back in november took me forever to get that. I was disappointed in trusting someone to be what they said to be a hardware retailer, but any who I know how that feels really bad since I got in a bad car wreck about a week later after discovering I got scammed caused by someone else and that could of helped me find a set of wheels for work and college. There are both good people and bad in bitcoins group and dogecoin group. I personally feel that we are in a way segregated instead of trying to become what this era of digital currency was meant to be.
