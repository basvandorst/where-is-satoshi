How do you guys feel this will effect Litecoin?
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:08:21
Link to them "doing something"?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:44:10
Not true (I think). For e.g. this mobo [here]( has x16/x16/x16/x16

Ah. What about foreign banks?

You're saying this based on experience?
Are you a chinese person **living in** China?

1) My thoughts exactly.
2) My thinking in getting a rig was that I wans't sure what kind of miner the BFL used. I.e. could I use it to mine LTC instead? Also, considering that LTC is supposed to be GPU "resistant" (because of scrypt), I was thinking that mayhaps this would extend the "lifeline" of the rig somewhat. 
Another thing to consider. A rig with 4x 7970 will have ~ 2400khashes. That will equate to ~1000 LTC in 4 months. Which at current prices (unless it tanks loads MORE) will be about $1600-2000. 
I was always planning to swap over to LTC anyway in the longterm.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:44
Even with the higher hash rate of the OC 7970's? 
200W higher but about ~600khash more in total

I have tried to pre-empt this by sending my ID docs to support in advance. They initially replied my email, but since then nothing. Is there any way to check if the account has been "verified" on BTC-e?
Edit: Also, whats the Bitfinex platform like? And how quickly can they authenticate/verify accounts and deal with bank transfers? Will append the list above with this.

I worry about this with both the ASIC and regular GPU builds. - The only thing is that once the difficulty gets too high, the ASICs will be pure paperweights, while I can still resell/game on the PC.

How hard would it be to reverse engineer (ie build) one of these?

Heh. Are you US based or EU?

What about the rich new gen chinese who are buying real estate in London, Paris and NYC?
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:43:48
At this stage your guess is as good as mine.
This is particularly true for large volume withdrawals.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:37:10
I don't follow - which do you think is better? The 7970 or 7950?
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:45:27
Both graphs are done on logarithmic scales. The BTC one is lifted from tradingview and the LTC one from bitcoinwisdom. 
LTC is at an ATH, I don't follow your comment.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:37:30
Any way of speeding up the process - I mean I already sent them my ID and proof of address?.... twice now.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:39:27
Tru dat.
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:23:34
Table above updated to reflect this.

Thanks for this. Pity its a paid app though!

How do I purchase 5000 shares? And how much would that cost?
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:15:05
Ok thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:13:19
We can't withdraw USD? Why not wtf?
Considering I initially deposited in USD (wire) and bought my BTC....?
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:59:39
While that may be true today, the barrier to entry for email was certainly a LOT higher in the 90's.
1. Dial up number
2. Login details
3. Await connect
4. Launch Eudora
5. Insert pop3 server details
6. Login to server
7. Await email download
8. Launch email
So, to put into perspective, bitcoin is in its infancy. Its not truly popular yet.

Stocktwits has a feed on this its $BCOIN.
Found this on another thread. What do you guys think?
Its a logarithmic graph.

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:58:25
So what would your recommendation be? 7950 or 7970?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:40:21
Heh. :)

I checked the BFGMiner github page - seems to support scrypt.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:38:13
Is your API related app/site available to everyone? - coz I'm pretty sure there is a lot of demand for it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:59:14
Yeah, this is another valid concern. Don't want to spend that much money and end up with a paperweight instead.
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:28:32
Thanks for the link! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:19:08
So do you have to provide them with the documents to withdraw the money?
I ask because you said you've made repeated transactions by wire.
My transfer went in without any issue. Converted fiat to LTC without issue. The problem is getting the money out. I have a "withdraw hold" in red for approx 30 days. 
Do I have to make another ticket and send them in documents again to "approve" the withdrawal? Even though its not in fiat.
Also, will I have to go through all this again if and when I send another transaction? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:25:10
Do you have a referrer code for Bitfinex?
