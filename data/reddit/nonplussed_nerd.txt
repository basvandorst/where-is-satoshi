I beg to differ, avoiding the use of `eval()` usually leads to better, more secure code.

Unfortunately that's not true. The 'perfect computer' spoken of in the graphic is a classical computer. Quantum computers do, in principle, break RSA encryption, making it much much much easier to brute force. 
And we will probably have functioning quantum computers sometime in the next few decades.The saying is that where we are in quantum computing is approximately where conventional computing was in the 30s.
It's probably inevitable that bitcoin will have to change.

I don't take the Copenhagen interpretation seriously either (I am actually a quantum physicist), and it is slowly falling out of favour, sortof. More accurately, it's becoming irrelevant, as we are starting to understand how the *appearance* of wavefunction collapse occurs, whether or not *actual* wavefunction collapse occurs. This is via a process called decoherence, whereby quantum systems can't stay in a superposition of states for long when they are coupled to an environment.
A big challenge for quantum computers is to:
a) isolate qbits from the environment effectively enough that they can stay in quantum superpositions for long periods of time or
b) develop error correcting algorithms that make quantum computing robust to small amounts of decoherece.


This is simply false.
Luckily, it doesn't matter which interpretation you prefer, quantum computers work in principle regardless, and the challenges in building one are all practical issues like how to provide enough isolation from the environment and how to manipulate large numbers of qbits without building house sized machines and spending billions of dollars.


Oh I see. They don't even believe in the superposition principle? Well, this is just absurd. About twenty metres to my right as I type this, there are a few million rubidium 87 atoms in a vacuum chamber, which are in a superposition of both spin and position states. [Here is a picture of the several hundred times we do this in a day]( Each set of three blobs is the spatial probability density of each of several million atoms, and the three blobs being separate is because each is in three different spin states which we can separate out in a magnetic field. We can take photos of them, and we can do interference experiments to verify that they were in fact in multiple states at once before we measured them. And we can do "weak" measurements that collapse them to one state only partially, leaving them partially coherent (which can be verified by subsequent interference experiments), and all this is described perfectly by quantum mechanics and decoherence theory (by the way, decoherence theory is *derived* from ordinary quantum mechanics, it is not a separate theory).
I realise that you think my entire field is bunk, but seriously, if quantum mechanics were untrue, what on earth do you think I do all day? We would be surprised and confused constantly, every single day in the lab, as the atoms in our experiment wouldn't do what we expect. We would not be able to get any work done. But in practise we can, because, well, quantum mechanics is correct (we are confused for different reasons, of course, but not because quantum mechanics made bad predictions), and the link you posted is just some crazy person ranting.
The computer you typed your comment on would not function if not for the superposition principle. Transistors would not function if electrons could not be in superpositions of position states and interfere with themselves constructively and destructively (which is the process that gives rise to band gaps in silicon)
There is overwhelming evidence for quantum mechanics, and there are thousands of researchers whose work would make no sense if it were untrue. It is not just some niche theory that we sometimes debate over some scotch and a puff on our pipes. We rely on it every day, and so do you every time you use even the most basic piece of technology.

They don't merely raise the difficulty rate. They make it possible to extract the private key from a public key within a reasonable timeframe. Of course we can just increase the length of the key, but we would have to increase it by much more than if it were just classical computers getting faster. Bitcoin addresses would get quite long!

For the downvoters, I don't think is implying you *should* do these things, just that if you're *not*, then it implies you don't truly believe what you're claiming to believe.
If you're not putting your money where your mouth is, we have no confidence that anything you say isn't just optimistic fluff.

The mention of arbitrage here is regarding the mechanism that will keep the ETF's stock price in line with that of bitcoin exchanges.
If the ETF's stock price ever deviates too far from what its held bitcoin would be worth on other exchanges, investors will be able to make profit through arbitrage, that is buying the ETF and selling bitcoin or vice versa and picking up the price discrepancy as gains.

This post looked so odd that I was sure the user was just pretending to be dogetipbot and had gotten the formatting wrong.
Then I realised I'm just not used to seeing it in a font other than comic sans :p

Thank you. About time someone pointed out that percentage change per unit time is really the relevant metric for volatility.

Not quite, the ASICs for litecoin will be here soon (they're not as big a step up from GPUs as the SHA-256 ones are though) and it's quite mineable on GPUs right now, with a bit more memory usage in the scrypt parameters litecoin could have prevented GPU mining too. That would have left everyone with a CPU on a level playing field.
A coin based on scrypt is definitely a step up from SHA-256 though.

Where I'm from cops have a lot of discretion, whilst you should know your rights and when to assert them, it also pays to not piss them off.

If you want to look at periodic effects, you should do a Fourier transform on the data.

I believe most of the Anglosphere uses 1,000.21, and most of Europe uses 1.000,21. It's certainly not just the US alone being different.
