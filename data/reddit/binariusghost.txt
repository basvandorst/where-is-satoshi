Sorry for the late answer did not see that notification.
I recently bought a Trezor. Seems to do the job just fine. It sends the hash containing the already signed transaction. Your private key is never "out there".

Doesn't look like cold storage to me.

One improvement I'd like is to be able to take a tab out of the full window and make a new window with it. Similarly to Chrome. 
Thanks for your great product. Nice concept can't wait to see the results overtime.

If you let your funds in exchanges, you're not really a pro.

IMO it's same old. Other proposals before took time to reach consensus.
SegWit is still a really new proposal and it's progression makes me think it's going to be adopted by the end of the year. We just need to stop focusing on the politics (Blocksize) and look at all the features SegWit allows. More and more buisnesses are waiting for SegWit to launch to put their code at work. In the end we'll also gain a temporary relief on the size issue and try to find the proper solution to that aswell.

Thanks Sam, will make a french video out of it. I was about to do a french recap of Bitcoin since the new year and I will link to this thread. Very very useful thank you.

You could monitor using network tools like PRTG. 
If you got a somewhat recent router or a decent firewall you might be able to look for traffic on the port 8333.
