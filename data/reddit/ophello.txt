No you aren't -- you're stating opinion. You don't know what people are doing with Bitcoin. And you probably lack the intelligence to forecast its future use. Leave that to people with vision.

Yes it IS a solution. No one who uses Bitcoin is dumb enough to be mad at you for giving them 0.9 back. They know that BTC is fluctuating in price. It's the dollars that matter, and they got their dollars back!
Bitcoin is NOT A CURRENCY!!!
It is a means to spend dollars!!!
Don't price your items in Bitcoins!!!!
Price them in dollars!!!

Leaving an apostrophe out is forgivable because it could just mean laziness. But when someone puts it in when it's not needed...extra effort was needed to make a dumb mistake.

"It's a hoax. I refuse to prove it."
How long ago was it? Can you give an estimate on the date?


Those are the only two options? No. The third option is that you mistakenly thought it was a hoax when it was actually different people in similar situations who all found their ways here separately.


That's weak. What is a widow that knows nothing about bitcoin supposed to sound like? And what the hell does the number of bitcoins prove?
You seem so sure of yourself but it's so obvious to me that you just made up your mind without really reading into it, and now you're passing your opinion off as fact. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:17:15
There is no reason whatsoever that anyone would make a hoax like this unless they were trying to steal bitcoins or some other nefarious purpose. And even then, there's no information in this thread that isn't available anywhere else.
Try reading her replies before you just write it off based on reading one post. You're not using investigative skills -- you're just being a douche.

I recommend asking someone to help you learn how to use Bitcoins WITHOUT telling them that you're actually trying to find your late husband's BTC. That way, you learn the skills, then apply them secretly with the knowledge you gain and uncover the funds yourself.
Your husband could have a paper wallet -- it would be a piece of paper with a QR code on it (pixel squares in a pattern). Otherwise, he could have bitcoins on a private exchange somewhere. You will need to know his username and password to access any online exchange.
Once you've actually found the bitcoin address and private key, you can convert them to cash any number of ways.
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:25:04

You don't actually pay them back in physical dollars. You pay them back in BTC but using the equivalent price in dollars. All you have to do is include a statement that all BTC purchases will be with respect to the dollar and that you are not responsible for short term BTC price fluctuations. Anyone who is smart enough to use BTC is going to know this. If anyone gets mad, you can simply point them to the sign you had clearly posted at the check stand.

It's more likely to be real than fake. You seem to think that 99% of the stuff on the internet is all lies. The truth is more complicated than that. A well-known news aggregate site like Reddit attracts a whole swath of the population. Lesser-known subreddits are a haven for genuine people with a vested interest in the subject. 
People don't just waltz into a subreddit with a very normal story, make timely replies, and share gratitude for being helped, all under the guise of a hoax, unless there's a REASON for it. The internet isn't just filled with people making shit up for no reason whatsoever. Anyone who is bullshitting will have a track record and is probably a scam artist.
So in your fucked up world, there's no reason to believe anyone on the internet who reaches out for help because it MUST be a hoax.
Now, you're telling me that you have NO reason to believe this person's story. I'll ask again: WHY? What is the reasoning?
Your little bullshit example is just intellectually lazy. Your story isn't actually believable and you're just being an asshat.

Anyone can get an address, sure. I know it's not possible to change BTC protocol. That's not what I'm suggesting.
When it comes to exchanges, you can easily prevent people from making more than one wallet and then tie the wallets to an ID.
In other words, if you want to use your BTC to buy goods and services, you'd "register" yourself with a government-sanctioned exchange that ties your wallet to your ID. You can always opt out, but in order to facilitate more widespread adoption, this step would have to happen.
The computer system that ties your ID and your BTC wallet would allow instant charges and chargebacks by operating separately from the blockchain. Each store would have its own accounts system that piggybacks on the blockchain. You buy your goods immediately and leave the store, but in reality, your charge is taking 10 minutes to verify.

@_date: 2014-04-13 08:04:28
Do you want a professional opinion? It's too simple, and it reads ambiguously. What is its purpose? What story is it trying to tell? What should blockchain *mean* to people? This design addresses none of that.
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:43:19
This is completely unnecessary. You're not thinking of this correctly. Bitcoin is not a currency. It is a store of value. If someone buys a fridge for $500, they should be able to return it for $500. The fact that the price of BTC changed during that time is incidental and totally irrelevant.
Just tell your customers that all returns will be provided relative to the DOLLAR and that you are NOT RESPONSIBLE for BTC value fluctuations.

I reaaaaaly need an answer here. If I somehow manage to earn 5-6 figures (in dollars) worth of bitcoins, is there any guarantee that I will be able exchange them for dollars OR do I have to find ONE person who has **all that money** and wants to buy ALL my bitcoins OR do I just rely on a network of buyers who will buy them? I need to understand how this works.

Bitcoin is more than digital money. It can also remove the need for a stock market, making any company publicly traded. Even your "daughter's lemonade stand" can have an IPO. It puts wealth back in the hands of the many instead of it getting siphoned off by the few. It does to the economy what the internal combustion engine did to society. And his argument is that Bitcoin is even more of a breakthrough.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:01:00
Not me.
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:24:30
No no no -- I mean if the amount of bitcoins I own translates to something that high. The guy who had $27 ended up with $800k -- does that mean that someone paid him $800k or did he just sell them to many other people all at once? Or is there even a guarantee that you *can* sell them? What is the point of investing in bitcoin if no one will buy them from you?
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:45:09
