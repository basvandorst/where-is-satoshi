This is exactly why I don't get the people saying LN will be too complex. It is like saying TCP is too complex for the average user lol. Well no shit, that is why we built browsers and other types of software on top of it

I do expect the amount of segwit transactions to be higher though. It is likely that users have done an extra transaction now to move to a segwit wallet but that'll mean that their normal transactions will be segwit from that point on

So Ethereum's mempool dropping in size along with other coins after the last big dip is just a coincidence?

It looks nice and it is user friendly. It's the same reason why coinbase is so big, UX is better than lots of complicated features if you want to reach as many people basic possible

Yeah when I read 391k I was like, why on earth would you hold over 423k on an exchange!?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:22:48
1% of the market cap if I remember correctly. So they are reaching 3b

Noobs don't die, they go back to coinbase to regroup

I think he is referring to the random alts which are only used to fund startups or random ICOs that don't have any other purpose besides that. Alts like xrp/monero and others are actually a good thing imo

Slightly unrelated but it's pretty weird how many Twitter replies are exact copies of comments on this Reddit topic lol. It seems one of them is automatically copying the other more and more, same with YouTube comment and other platforms 
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:55:25
Yeah the movie is called the Italian Job 
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:43:29
You're pretty ignorant if you think that reddit isn't a big source of news for a lot of people
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:19:28
Yeah lets teach people about fake new by spreading more fake news, fucking genius

Official video on his channel

Underrated? That show has 270k ratings on IMDb with an average of 8.6 lol

9 Times out of 10 with these polls the crypto-fans are either more interested/thoughtful around the subject thus resulting in more crypto favorable votes.
Or litteraly just brigading by communities like you often see with those "Favorite coin" or "Which coin should we list next" polls. 
Twitter polls with these numbers are not something that should be taken seriously imo. There are telegram groups with 10x the amount of people as that poll's vote count lol

The most important reasons for me personally is that your private key NEVER leaves your hardware wallet. E.G. if I have to do a transaction or I need to setup a new software wallet on my laptop I don't have to expose my keys by typing them over or storing them in the software.
I can take the hardware wallet with me knowing that if I lose it the keys are protected by a pin code and if I lose it I can restore my keys using the seed words that were generated on the first installation. With most paper wallets you are basically screwed if you lose it or someone else finds it.

Binance decreased almost all fees yesterday FYI
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:12:53
A proper hardware wallet is more reliable/secure than a paper wallet though

I own and like the Nano Ledger S but I hear the Trezor is pretty nice aswell

There is audio

Yes fellow human, we must modify our neural networks to better integrate with the human population

No not at all lol, especially for currencies where Asics are common and you're like 1/100th or worse as effective. You're basically getting a net loss if you consider that you'll have to buy a new phone sooner because of the intensive usage.

Damn I've seen tons of scams lately but it looks like they are using jsfiddle which is a sandbox for creating webpages to create a fake wallet tracker. It shows fake payments/rewards to trick more people into sending money
The fake thing they built: 
The real transaction list: 
EDIT: And check the replys on twitter. Tons of fake accounts replying with faked coinbase screenshots 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:35:26
There are tons for people like Vitalik and Charlie lee aswell + big exchanges like binance/coinbase

Unless you're getting them for free it probably isn't worth it. In fact the hashrate might go up so much that at some point it becomes basically impossible to earn back your investment

Yeah I see this thrown around a lot but I've never seen actual proof or an example of it either

The power of a big marketing budget at work basically yeah
