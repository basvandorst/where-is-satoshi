In reality it comes from frustration after waiting 4 days for a 0.05 btc tx to clear with 176sat/byte. I am a long time fan who is frustrated. I am not alone.

Exactly this. What, besides early market adoption, does btc do better than any other coin doing the same job?

No other coin offers security and decentralization? Cmon. Try harder.

Limited supply = deflationary. Bubbles are caused by inflation. IE printing more money. Not possible with bitcoin. Supply &amp; Demand drive bitcoin price. Money is whatever people agree on and assign value to. 
Hope this helps or at least gets you to stop using the word bubble where it has no real meaning.

Ok mate. Fell free to think that. Time will tell.

We are not talking about other coins. My statement is regarding btc specifically. We can have totally different discussions with any coin. Bitcoin is better by default at this moment in time because you need to use it to get the others, its the name people know most. It is king of the hill. You dont see Litecoin futures anywhere, no, because its all about the BTC.

Or the Feds pumping to acclimate us to a totally trackable one world currency. Get your tinfoil hat and get ready for FedCoin! /s

Probably not, I'm long term holding . They will surely realize what they are missing and change the law before I ever withdraw.

This is EXACTLY what it is.

Again, you can make more tulips. You cant make more bitcoin than is predetermined. You are watching a normal market correcting normally after being in an oversold state.

Like i said in your other exact same reply, this is about Bitcoin. You know you are in r/Bitcoin right? Try not to confuse the subject. You can not print more BTC.

More importantly, none of them are Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

I'm American but live in Norway last 20 years. I pay taxes to Norway.

Anytime. There might be some cheaper alternatives, but count on complex id registration on most. Coinmama was simple to just pay with card.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:10:20
Crypto is not considered to be real money in Norway. Therefor not taxed.

I used coinmama 9 times for around 0.2 btc each time with no problems. One eth purchase sent to Binance got stuck but Binance support manually verified it after contacting them on advice from Coinmama support. 
Fees are a bit on the heavy side, but it's dependable.

Babylon Vape in Kristiansand, Norway has one. They got some local news coverage about it. Don't know if it's the one in the picture though.
Edit: confirmed this is the one. *source:* My wife is the shop manager.

TenX has a visa debit card that used coin.
