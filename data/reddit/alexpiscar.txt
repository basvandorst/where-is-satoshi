Another reason to be interested in trading in cryptocurrencies! I've heard about cafe and restaurant where you can pay cryptocurrencies, but not about beer pubs!  Una cerveza por favor!

As far as I understand, these ones were solved. And now CoinDeal is become more and more popular, not only in Poland. I think this is because a lot of contests which they organize!

I heard that 'Futurocoin' coin has its own café, where you can pay with this currency and have ATMs there as well. Interesting, is not it? I wonder what the price of cakes is at BTC LOL xD

Uhm, in my humble opinion, this watch is another proof that BTC is no longer an investment for regular, ordinary players. Big business, big corporations, whales, and even governments such as Canada and China were interested in this - and these rumors of price manipulations! I am sorry, Mr. BTC and Hublot, but I do not buy it.

Guys, calm down. Where is the market going to come back, when it is real only at this moment, and tomorrow it will be different? it's interesting that whenever there are drops, everyone talks about the decline of cryptocurrencies. Was it the same when the stock market in the last weeks when there were such big drops? Probably not. So I'm looking at the future with positive thoughts. I've invested in the altcoins (mostly FuturoCoin) and I hope this will bring me profits.

1) I do not consider myself an expert who you are probably. How do you make your decisions about investing? In my opinion, the best preparation for investing is a reliable analysis of the possessed data (eg on the chart). What's wrong with that? 
2) Dennis O'Neil, an analyst evaluating the FuturoCoin project, talked about similar predictions in an interview with him.

Ok, but some of market experts say that even in the current situation, still BTC is more predictable than NASDAQ. So, there are pros and cons as usual. But I will not agree on the crowd panic and the statement of death of crypto. I actively track changes on the charts on my coindeal exchange account and it looks like the next year there will be increase.

I think that a lot of people have so decided because these 10,000 is a gift - they did not have them before, so it does not make a difference for them if they will have them in the future... They can take the risk. If they worked for it, they would choose another option. For example, I invest in altcoins and there I would see my 10,000. (it's best to invest them in the FTO).

it makes an impression... but I do not care how much he is wealth - better if he used these banks for charitable purposes. I start my adventure with cryptocurrencies but if I succeed I will also think about others....

When it comes to other countries, I'm shocked that Zimbabwe government decided that - even a South Korea has the softer regulations re Internet and even crypto trading. Just take a look - "Commissioner of the Financial Services Commission of South Korea, has confirmed that there are no obstacles for national banks to provide their clients with virtual accounts". This is a big change compared to the last year. Do you think that more countries will go this way? More details you can find here: [

There is a similar in Wroclaw for BTC and FTO (FuturoCoin) in a very nice place FuturoCoin Cafe - and will you guess what? You can pay FuturoCoin and Bitcoin for caffee and cake as well!

Even if BTC is in retreat, the change it has made in the market, in economics, finance and banking is simply impossible to evaluate. Thanks to it, blockchain technology has become a topic that has been developed by the largest technological companies. Cryptocurrencies began to be the subject of even legislation (not to mention mass consciousness, mass media and art). Thanks to the success of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies are developing today. On the other hand, I heard lot of people who do not recommend investing too much in BTC. This is no longer a game for ordinary players. Maybe is it better to invest in altcoins? What do you think?

I can bet that you're not right. But it's interesting that whenever there are drops, everyone talks about the decline of cryptocurrencies. Was it the same when the stock market in the last weeks when there were such big drops? Probably not. So I'm looking at the future with positive thoughts. I've invested in the several altcoins on CoinDeal platform and I hope they will bring me profits.
