Why does it matter how the git history was obtained? The girl who claim to have created the app already confirmed 97% of the code was committed by some other developer.  
  
Also, even if she could not create a private repo, her friend could still invite her to his private repo, so her defense really make zero sense.  
  
I think the 'no storyboard' comment has less to do with poor technique and more to do with increased difficulty. I'm not an iOS developer myself, but I imagine it would be a hundred times easier to develop an app using storyboards.  
  
The OP make some weak and ridiculous arguments in his post, like lack of activity on SO and GitHub (like wtf, even a professional with 10 years of experience might not have either of those things, and for all he knows, she could've posted questions using throwaway accounts assuming she even had the need to post any questions at all).  
  
But it doesn't take a genius to figure out that she's taking credit for somebody else's work. Just looking at the work required, the quality of the work, the time spent, and her really ridiculous defense. It's the Ahmed clock all over again.

The GitHub defense completely destroys her credibility. Her comment already gives the impression she's capable of using git/GitHub (I assume it was also her who committed the other 3%, unless there's a third party as well), and if she's capable of building a polished app that communicates with other service APIs and publish it to the App Store (which is truly a pain in the ass to work with) then she should be capable of using basic git commands.
