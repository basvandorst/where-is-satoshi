@_date: 2018-01-23 15:18:46
Yeah, so there is more subtlety here than I realized, and I forgot that gpg only prints names and emails of keys you imported into your keyring.  However, the main point still stands: a single attack on one of the servers managing bitcoin.org would allow an attacker to change both the PGP key download *and* the software download.  Your question implied you had downloaded the correct key and I'm challenging that assumption.  It would be much better to provide multiple, isolated ways for people to verify the pgp key.  Or just put a disclaimer saying that this first invocation of gpg is useless, but it will help them later when they need to verify the next version of Bitcoin Core.

You might be right, but even if your rule is included in the soft fork, the miner can easily make a transaction with their own wallet that has an arbitrarily low fee (or find one in the mempool).  Then they include the transaction in the block and report that fee as the lowest, so they can lower the reported fee level pretty easily (at a slight cost to themselves though).

The "consensus algorithm" is simply the set of rules for what constitutes a valid block in the blockchain.  It checks that the block has the right format and that all the transactions in it are valid, with valid signatures and such.  Depending on how you define "consensus algorithm", it might also include rules for what block you consider to be the best block.  I'm not interested in arguing about definitions.
While the algorithm does allow free transactions, it also has a block size limit which means it is not economically feasible right now for a user to make free transactions because most miners won't include those transactions in the blocks they mine (and nodes with memory limits might not even store the transaction).
No, it's not controlled by the miners.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:23:30
I guess the miners have an incentive so report the highest possible fee number in the block header so that wallet users will increase the fees in their transactions and pay more to the miners.  So that's why you prevent them from reporting a fee level that is too high.  But there is not much incentive for them to underreport it, unless they want to attack the network and cause people's transactions to get delayed.

The web of trust never caught on, but it's OK because people can just ignore the warning messages about it and use other methods to verify the key.
If we can't find good instructions about how to verify the key on bitcoin.org we should probably ask Wladimir in a more direct manner.  He could post a Gist on with his Github account, post on bitcointalk.org, and he probably has a personal website too.  There is also a service called [keybase]( that helps automate this thing of looking on different websites and social media accounts to get PGP key signatures.

Instead of using `curl` and then the GPG import command, it's probably fine to do it with one command like the StackOverflow answer does:
    gpg2 --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x90C8019E36C2E964
I expect that to be more secure too, because the gpg command would be able to check the checksum of the key that MIT provides.
It still bothers me that your medium article is the only trusted place to get Wladimir's key checksum, but what you've done here is a good improvement.

Let's talk about the Bitcoin Core "Installation" section.  You wrote:


No, that's definitely wrong.  Anyone with a computer can make a PGP key with any name and email they want.  We need to make sure that the file was signed by the actual correct key or else running gpg is pointless.  The keys have checksums (long strings of hex digits), so you could do your readers a favor and tell them what the checksum of Wladimir's key should be, or link to a trusted website that is separate from bitcoin.org which contains the checksum.  This StackOverflow post seems useful though I didn't read it carefully:
The other good thing that the author points out is that you can run `sha256sum` in check mode so it checks the checksums for you, no need to eyeball it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:13
Did you want lower fees?  The cost of Bitcoin transaction fees (in USD) went down by 20% today!
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:03:05
The `--recv-keys` command might work with `gpg`.  You could just try running `gpg --recv-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964` and see what happens.  I don't have a Raspberry Pi handy right now but on Manjaro Linux this command does work because `gpg` and `gpg2` both run GnuPG 2.2.4.
Your article isn't especially trustable by itself, but if a Bitcoin enthusiast can find several webpages on different domains that all agree on what Wladimir's official key is, including yours, then that could be enough evidence for them to trust the key and therefore trust the software download.
I don't think PGP key servers like the MIT one vet their keys; I uploaded my key to the MIT one with no questions asked.   So you can't rely on MIT to be the source of trust here.
The general way to establish that you trust the Bitcoin binaries is:
1. Make sure you trust the checksum/fingerprint of someone's key by getting it form multiple sources.  Check enough sources so that it would be hard for one person to change them all.
2. Download a key and make sure the checksum matches.
3. Make sure the key was used to sign SHA256SUMS.asc.
4. Make sure the checksums in SHA256SUMS.asc match the file you downloaded.
Right now it seems like your article is skipping 1 and 2; the reader has to trust that you gave them the right checksum and they also have to trust that MIT returns a key with that checksum.
Instead of just keeping on telling you what is wrong with your approach maybe I should just provide an approach that I think would be good:
    wget 
    wget 
    wget 
    sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS.asc --ignore-missing
    gpg ./laanwj-releases.asc  # Manually verify that it says 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
    gpg --import ./laanwj-releases.asc
    gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc  # Manually verify the fingerprint again in case there are malicious keys in your keyring
The output then would look something like this:
    gpg: Signature made Sat 11 Nov 2017 05:52:22 AM PST
    gpg:                using RSA key 90C8019E36C2E964
    gpg: Good signature from "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) &lt;laanwj [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
I struggled with finding the right commands for this post for a while.  I considered using the `--trusted-key` argument when running `gpg --verify` because it would get rid of the warning, but it actually sets Wladimir's key to have "ultimate" trust for future verifications, which seemed surprising and bad.  A power user of gpg would want to somehow mark Wladimir's key as trusted, but I can't really find a nice way to do that which would be appropriate for everyone.  Maybe if I knew more about all the trust models provided by the `--trust-model` option I could pick a good one or something.
Another option would be for people to download the key using `gpg --recv-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964`.  I decided not to do it that way since it looked kind of sketchy for them to be copying a cryptic code like that from Medium onto their computer.
This stuff is tricky!  I feel like bitcoin.org should provide more guidance since I might be missing something.

The *sunk cost fallacy* is usually defined as throwing more money at a bad activity/gamble/investment because of how much you've already invested.
If you think that the size of your original crypto investment matters for current and future decisions, isn't that kind of the same thing as the sunk cost fallacy?  The cost basis of your investment only matters for tax purposes; I don't think it should have an effect on what risks you are willing to take, making you feel good about losing a ton of money or making you feel bad about losing a small amount of money.
Another way of putting it is: the trades you made in the past are done.  If you are investing to make your future better instead of just to make yourself feel good, the important thing to think about when making your next cryptocurrency trade is your current assets, your guesses about how well those assets will do, and your plans for the future.  I'd suggest putting the details of past trades out of your mind because they won't have an effect on your future and might skew your decision for no good reason.
Another way of saying it is: suppose you meet someone who has 2 Bitcoins and $30000 in fiat.  The right choice for their next trade shouldn't depend on whether the Bitcoin was a gift, or something they paid a lot of money for; that's in the past and you shouldn't even need to know about that when advising them on what to do (except to understand their capital gains tax obligations).
Another way of phrasing it is: a long-term HODLer with 150 Bitcoins and a small amount of fiat is taking the same amount of risk as someone who earned $2.1 million some other way and chose to buy 150 Bitcoins today, leaving just a small amount of fiat left in their bank account.  They are both in the same situation (modulo capital gains tax) and exposed to the same risks, and it doesn't seem justified if emotions about past trades cause them to act differently.

2. When someone invests in buying one of these colored coins, what guarantee can that person get from Overstock that the coin actually has any value?

(The other parts of your comment are OK.)
**EDIT 1:**  Here are some things we could explore in this discussion that would have been more useful than "use something else":
* Is the program open source?  If so, has someone forked it and disabled that fee?
* Are there other wallet programs out there that are just as good and do not charge a fee?  What are the steps needed to migrate to those programs?
* How much money do the developers make from that fee?  Who are these developers, and does the fee make a big difference to them?
**EDIT 2:**  I feel like the "Use something else." comment actually discourages discussion.  I think its intent is to make people feel bad or wrong for offering criticism of the software, and make them go away.

It's not impossible, but it takes some programming effort and a lot of data entry.  (And I say that as someone who doesn't do very many transactions.)
I made my own software in Ruby for calculating cryptocurrency capital gains, losses, and income for the IRS.  I enter all my crypto activities in a text file in a format I made up (it's actually executable Ruby code, but that's not necessarily a good thing).  Then the software processes my file, divides by transactions into lots, calculates the cost basis and proceeds for each lot, and tells me how what to write on the tax forms.
It also tells me how much money I have in each crypto wallet, and I can write assertions about my balance at different points in time to help keep my records in order.
A few months ago I added support for multiple currencies and currency forks so I could report my "income" from the Bitcoin Cash fork (the BCash tax).
If you search for "Bitcoin taxes" online, you can find companies trying to sell software for Bitcoin taxes as a product, but if you have a scripting language at your command it is easy enough to do it yourself (I haven't gotten audited yet).

The advantage was the someone was able to send Bitcoin to Edward Snowden and there was perhaps less risk of the sender's identity being compromised because of the way it was delivered.

Satoshi Nakamoto is a concept and a myth that birthed Bitcoin to the world and while there may be many people in the world that believe Dr. Wright is we don't think it's important to the future of Bitcoin and we are here to focus on the future of Bitcoin Cash.  And we are happy to have people believe what they want to believe or not.

And we're about to release a whole lot of technology and other things, and nothing there should matter about who someone was.  Proof of authority is not what Bitcoin's about.

* 1 = 00
* 2 = 01
* 3 = 10
* 4 = 11
* 5 = 0
* 6 = 1
This will take more rolls than the base 6 way people are talking about but at least it is very simple and doesn't require a large integer math library.
It is ok if the user accidentally generates one extra bit of entropy on the last die roll because you can discard it.

This poster expresses an important idea, *the idea of a world where we don't share secrets with anyone* (or just a few people).  However, there are a few small parts of it that make it seem clueless/naive, and that's why the poster is getting so much negative feedback from this community.  I think you could address all the criticism by tweaking the wording:
Remove "But with blockchain technology, it's possible to sign in with just an address." and replace it with "But with public-key cryptography, it's possible to sign in with just a signature."
Remove "You can use a wallet to simply and easily prove ownership of an address." and replace it with "You can use a Bitcoin wallet to prove you have the private key of a Bitcoin address, without sharing any secrets."
With these tweaks I think the community would be much more accepting.

My problem with this audit is that it doesn't prove that Kraken actually has the **private keys** to any of those Bitcoin addresses that they listed.  The private keys are necessary in order to actually use the money.  When [Andreas M. Antonopoulos audited Coinbase]( he at least got them to sign a transaction using one of their cold storage addresses.
What Kraken should do is provide the auditor with a list of their Bitcoin addresses, their public keys, and a message that was signed with each private key.  ECDSA is a general signature algorithm and you can use it to sign things other than Bitcoin transactions.  The message should not be a real transaction; it should be a simple ASCII string that puts a lower bound on the date it was created, such as:
"This Bitcoin address is controlled by Kraken.  Today's date is 2014-03-24 and the front page of the New York Times says 'Japan to Let U.S. Assume Control of Nuclear Cache'."

Yeah, it's dumb for Armory to do this.  I'm sure it could have just generated a random number and stored it in a file for the purposes of filtering out duplicates in their statistics; they don't have to use a hash of the home directory.

If I had a project named "DNS for your bitcoin address", it would be a way to add a TXT record to your domain name that has your BTC address in it, and a corresponding browser plugin that makes it easy to donate to that address when you are visiting the site.

Why should we trust bitcoinvigil.com?
I tried the service and saw that they just generate a private and public key for you and tell you to send Bitcoin to the corresponding Bitcoin address.  Even if I audited the javascript on their site and determined that the private key was generated in the browser using a secure random number generator and not transmitted on the internet, there is nothing to prevent them from changing their javascript to be malicious tomorrow, or randomly changing it for one out of every 20 users.  The site doesn't even use HTTPS, which should be standard for any crypto-currency tool.
Also, they don't tell you where to put the downloaded file or what kind of file it is.  If you believe that their service works, it only works against malware that scans your "Downloads" folder.
I can't find real names of any of the people involved in making this website.  The domain was registered using a WhoisGuard anonymization service.
The idea they present is a good one, but instead of making a website they should have made a downloadable program in an interpreted scripting language, or they should have just made instructions on how to create a honey pot using a popular Bitcoin wallet like Multibit, Armory, or Bitcoin Core.
TLDR:  Don't trust them.  A honey pot is a good idea but find a secure way to make one.

Hi, I've been writing USB firmware professionally for 5 years and I can help answer this question.  Our USB devices have updatable firmware so that we can easily distribute bug fixes and new features to our customers over the internet, without requiring them to have any special programming hardware.  (They can download firmware updates from our website and apply them if they want using our software.)  Here's an [example](
Besides that, there are many user-programmable development boards with USB out there, where the whole point of the board is that you can update the firmware with your own thing.  The [Arduino Leonardo]( is a popular example.
A mass-produced USB thumb drive probably does not require updatable firmware, but it is very hard for you to determine if the device's firmware can be updated.  There is no way for the computer to directly access the device's firmware, and even if you take apart a USB thumb drive to look at it, it won't be obvious how the firmware works or whether it can be updated.

Your service is fundamentally broken because it is misapplying the basic ideas of cryptographic signatures.  I'm looking at  and it says:








The data on that page proves *nothing* about who kotarius is or what his/her Bitcoin addess is.  All it proves is that whoever controls that address signed a message whose contents was "kotarius".  As the operator of this website, you could easily change the address and signature without notifying kotarius.

I can see what projas is hinting at.  For example, consider this pseudocode that handles a customer request for a bitcoin withdrawal:
    balance = fetchCustomerBalanceFromDatabase();
    if(balance &lt; bitcoinWithdrawalRequestAmount)
    {
        raise exception "Cannot withdraw that many bitcoins; it exceeds your balance."
    }
    sendBitCoin(bitcoinWithdrawalRequestAddress, bitcoinWithdrawalRequestAmount);
    setCustomerBalanceInDatabase(balance - bitcoinWithdrawalRequestAmount);
If this code is just implemented in the most straightforward way without semaphores or transactions, it will be vulnerable to attacks because the same code might be running for the same customer on two different servers or processes at once.  If the user has 10 BTC in his account and makes two simultaneous requests to withdraw that 10 BTC, it is possible that both requests will succeed and the system will not detect that anything funny has happened.  The sequence of events would be:
* Server 1 fetches the customer's balance (10 BTC) from the database and verifies there is enough for the withdrawal (also 10 BTC).
* Server 2 does the same.
* Server 1 sends 10 BTC to the user and records his new balance (0 BTC).
* Server 2 sends 10 BTC to the user and records his new balance (0 BTC).

You can't read the contents of the firmware over the computer, because the USB device is an independent system that has control over what data it sends to and from the computer.  Therefore it would be really hard/impossible (and require extra hardware) to actually see the firmware on a typical USB device.
(I was not trying to say anything about whether a virus has to overwrite the whole firmware.)
@_date: 2014-08-02 06:10:53
USB has no inherent security, but security could be built into the operating systems that use USB.  I imagine that any USB device plugged in more than a second after boot time would be treated as a potential threat and the user would be prompted about it and asked whether they want to enable it.  If you plug in a thumb drive with malicious firmware, your OS might say "Do you want to enable this USB keyboard?" and you would click "No".

Given that Satoshi chose SHA256 as one of the main Bitcoin hashing algorithms, and it has a 256-bit output, it seems nice to choose a 256-bit elliptic curve like secp256k1 to go along with it.  That way, your block IDs and transaction IDs (which come from the hash) have the same size as the private keys (which come from the curve), and almost the same size the public keys (which are technically 257 bits).

I think the article doesn't do a good job of making arguments or presenting evidence, but it made me think of something interesting.  **If a hard fork happens, it seems like it would be difficult to have two separate markets and exchange rates for the coins on both sides of the fork.**
Suppose I own 1 bitcoin at the time when the blockchain gets forked.  Then I will have 1 bitcoin on both forks, and let's call them Fork A and Fork B.  I might decide that Fork A is the real fork and Fork B will die off.  I would like to sell my bitcoin on Fork B to anyone who disagrees with me and thinks Fork B will live on.  If Bob wants to buy my Fork B bitcoin from me for $20, then I would make a transaction that sends my bitcoin to Bob, but there is no way for me to prevent my transaction from ending up on both forks against my will.
This issue could totally be fixed by adding something to the Bitcoin protocol where a transaction can specify what chain it is on, and it would be invalid for miners to include the transaction on any other chain.  (For example, the transaction could include the hash of a previous block inside it.)
Since we don't have that feature, it is pretty difficult for me to treat the bitcoin I own on both forks independently.
Now, if I am clever, I would be able to create two different incompatible transactions that both send the same bitcoin to myself, and I would get one of them included only on Fork A and one only on Fork B.  Then at that point, I would be able to sell my Bitcoin independently on Fork A or Fork B.  I think that is what mircea_popescu is talking about in the article.
I don't see it as an attack though, I just see it as a tool for traders who want to sell the bitcoin they own on one fork without touching the bitcoin on another.   I don't see how any of the information above, or the information in the article, is an argument against a hard fork.  There is no potential for deceipt or fraud as long as people are paying attention to the fork and understand that there are multiple flavors of bitcoin.

Hello, five-year old.  A long time ago, a boy named [SL]( went to the beach and spent a long time building a [sand castle](  SL said that other children could help improve the design of the sand castle, and he would appreciate people to [review]( the sandcastle's design and point out problems, and that the sand castle design was free for everyone to use.  Everyone liked the sand castle and its design.
But then SL saw some Chinese boys and girls building a [similar sandcastle]( with his plans and SL got [upset](  Yesterday, SL decided to try to [rewrite the history of the world]( to say that many of his earlier sand castle designs were not copyable, even though those designs were already released to the public.  SL found all the old sand castle plans from the last six months, and even though they were dated in the past, he erased the old rules with his pencil and wrote in the new rules.
The other boys and girls [noticed]( him doing this because they have memories.  It was obvious to everyone that he was trying to rewrite history and to restrict the use of his sandcastle designs, and SL lost some friends that day.

The cost you pay for a product is generally an indicator of the total amount of trouble it was for other people in the world to produce it.  There are some exceptions to that, like if the seller has a monopoly on the product.  So we can conclude from the price difference that it is probably more trouble for the Trezor people to make a Trezor for you than it is for the BWallet people to make BWallet for you.  This means that if you buy a BWallet instead of a Trezor, you probably reduced the overall amount of work that people had to do in the world.  This should improve the economy at least, and I think that it is also correlated to the environment, because the trouble that people are going through to make a Trezor involves driving, shipping components, running SMT soldering machines, and generally consuming energy.  Consuming energy is generally considered to harm the environment.
There are all sorts of holes that can be poked in this argument, sure.  Maybe the price of the Trezor is higher only because the worker's salaries are higher, but they don't directly consume more energy in making it.  Well, if the workers' salaries are higher it means that they would have done comparatively more good for the world if they had worked somewhere else, and the good that they would have done at the other place might translate into a better environment because they would be saving the time and energy of others.
You might argue that the Trezor price is artificially high right now because they *had* a monopoly.  Or some entity might be subsidizing BWallet and selling it for a loss.  I don't really have all the answers, and maybe the environment argument is kind of weak, but I still think that prices are a good way to tell what the social cost of an item is.  An economist I respect thinks the same way:

I want a modular wallet system that gives you multiple choices for:

3. How to transmit my own transactions to the blockchain (internet, Tor, mail, etc)

No, the license of the firmware doesn't inherently affect how secure the device is.  Even under the new license, you are still free to read all of source code of the firmware and audit it for bugs, or pay professionals to do that.  However, it is likely that the number of people reviewing the code and submitting bug fixes will go down due to the restrictive license, so that could inadvertently make it less secure.  (I'm not sure how many people were reviewing it before though, maybe it was a small number.)

Gavin argues that increasing the block size is urgent in order to prevent nodes from filling up their memory with pending transactions.  If that is a  concern he has, shouldn't he just add a feature to Bitcoin Core that **saves pending transactions to the file system**, where there should be plenty of free space?

I think when you use the Bitcoin blockchain for something other than bitcoin currency, you kind of lose the decentralized consensus feature.  The blockchain is designed to make a clear consensus about how much bitcoin is in every bitcoin address (and what transaction outputs are unspent).  The data in the blockchain is very clear about this.  The blockchain doesn't know about concert tickets, so maybe alternate implementations of Colu/colored coins will disagree on who owns the ticket?  You could easily be running the wrong implementation and not know it because the Bitcoin miners will still accept your transactions.  Not sure if this will cause a real problem.

It's fair to say that the development of Linux is centralized.  If you can convince Linus Torvalds to add your code to his version of Linux, then your code stands a much greater chance of being supported for many decades and being integrated into every major Linux distribution.  There is no blockchain to help the community come to a decentralized consensus on what the official Linux code base is; everyone just has to do some Google searches and talk to various people to figure it out.  Most people currently say that the official Linux comes from Linus Torvalds, so he has extra power, and this is a form of centralization.

If this land ledger is truly decentralized, then there would be no way for a judge to seize the land, because the person who has the private key for the blockchain transaction might hide it or destroy it.
So it makes me think they will have some centralized way to invalidate entries in the ledger (perhaps using multi-signature transactions), which means the ledger isn't really decentralized at all.

I would rather not depend on other people to tell me about upcoming changes to Bitcoin.  Sure, it's nice to tune in to this Reddit so I can know about things coming up before they happen.  But if I'm developing my own Bitcoin software and miss some important Reddit articles or BIPs, I would prefer a hard fork because then my software can notify me that something is wrong, and then I can make an informed decision about how to handle it as Mike explained in his post.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:26:06
We aren't allowed to talk about that fork here, but I can make general comments.  Generally, forks of Bitcoin still use the same cryptographic setup, so you still have the same set of private keys, public keys and addresses.  Therefore, the private data in your "Bitcoin New wallet" could be used to sign a transaction that would be valid on either chain.  The scenario you are talking about should not happen.    There are plenty of Bitcoins that are unspendable because they were sent to addresses where the private key has been lost or was never known.  This is not new, and it is not affected by a hard fork.
If you send Bitcoin to a wallet (of the New client or the Classic client) before the hard fork occurs, and then the hard fork occurs, your money would be on both forks.  There isn't any risk of losing that money because your wallet files contain the private keys that would allow you to spend your money on either fork.  (But if you specifically only want to spend the money on one fork, that could be difficult, as I mentioned in my previous comment.)

If the blockchain does fork, we will need a new generation of apps that can represent that fork to you and let you know how much money you have on each fork, and whether it can be independently spent or not.  I'm not trying to be a downer, that actually sounds fun and important!

Content creators getting paid is not more important than free speech.  If you think it is, could you explain your reasoning?  I think they can make money with ads, donations, and speeches, but it's not any of my business.  If they can't make money naturally, they shouldn't use law enforcement to extract money from peaceful people by force.  Freedom is way more important than supporting your favorite business model from the previous century.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:31:22
The article says:


Actually, it will take a lot of work to make that happen.  In a hard fork, the basic format of a transaction often remains the same.  If you have some coins from the before the fork, and if you broadcast a transaction intending to sell those coins on the Bitcoin Classic blockchain, then your transaction might get included on the Bitcoin New blockchain against your will, either by accident or by a malicious party.
To actually achieve independent control of your Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin New coins, you would need to first mix your coins with an unspent transaction output  (UTXO) that only exists on one of the chains; the resulting UTXO would only exist on one of the chains.  Therefore, UTXOs that exist on just one chain are slightly more valuable, because they enable this feature of converting multi-chain coins into single-chain coins.
A new generation of apps might be required in order to help investors actually choose between the two types of Bitcoin.

I think that as the price goes higher, more and more early adopters will be able to retire and spend all their time working on Bitcoin-related software and services, which in turn will boost the price.

Mining is more like rolling dice thousands of times, it's not like building a house.

So your revenue per hour is solely determined by your own hash rate, the current difficulty, the price of the coin, and the current block reward.

There is a lot of great information in this post.  Unfortunately, at the end, it devolves to [appeal to authority](  I think a lot of people will interpret the comment as saying that because some people do a lot of awesome work for Bitcoin, when they say it can't handle larger blocks we should trust their judgment.  But you're not actually presenting the evidence that backs up the claim.
So yeah, this comment is interesting but it doesn't actually make an argument against larger blocks.  It stirs up some doubt about whether large blocks are doable based on an appeal to authority.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:35:46
OK, let's go with that analogy.  A Bitcoin client is kind of like a LibreOffice that can only open *one* particular .odt file (the blockchain) which is stored on thousands of nodes around the world.  As a user, you can submit lines of text (transactions) to be added to this document, but you can't simply add them and click Save as you would do in LibreOffice.  The only people who can edit the document are the miners, and they do so by adding one page (one block) at a time.  You must submit your line of text to the network and hope one of the miners includes it in a page some time.
Initially, "Bitcoin New" and "Bitcoin Classic" will both have the same file open.  But at some point, they will fork that file and then they will have different files open.  The first portion of each file will be the same, but every page after the fork will be different.
As a user, it's possible to write a line of text that will be valid in only one of the documents or both, but it can be hard to control that because no apps currently exist to help you do that.

Is that true?  I thought SegWit was a soft fork so people don't have to use it or account for it at all in the software they run, and can just keep doing things as normal.  (Unless you are miner, and then you have to follow the rules of SegWit to make sure other nodes accept your blocks.)  So that would be the reason why there was no fork.

The first two numbers in the sentence used commas as a meaningless separator.  Then at the end of the sentence he appears to use it as a decimal point.

If you were running WikiLeaks and received important leaks about one political party in an election, would you actually withhold them from the public?  Why?  Wouldn't withholding it make you lose all credibility and show you are a stooge of that party just trying to help them get elected? Assange doesn't hack anyone himself, he just receives and processes information, and he can't really choose what he receives. 
How does publishing a leak fuck with democracy?  Because it influences voters?  Well, spending money to run ads, attending protests, attending rallies, and telling your friends to vote would also fuck with Democracy then.

Huh, OK, so let's assume that the Schnorr stuff works with existing addresses, and that it wouldn't be implemented as a hard fork.  That means that if I am running today's version of Bitcoin core and then they deploy Schnorr signatures on the network, I would somehow accept the blocks using the Schnorr signatures but I wouldn't be able to check those signatures myself?  I guess that seems feasible; maybe if the witness data has a version number higher than my software can recognize, then I just don't bother verifying it?

For example, right now, a sufficiently powerful administrator at Reddit could just edit this message that I am writing to put words in my mouth, or they could delete it entirely.
We need a way to have decentralized forums.  I imagine a person participating could run their own web server that hosts their posts and also stores copies and/or links to the posts of other users.  Similar to how most people don't host their own email, most people would probably delegate the forum server duties to a third party, but they would retain control of their own identity and data at all times.

Personally, I don't want to have my drive's permissions so open.  I put `umask=002,gid=plugdev` into my fstab so that only users in the `plugdev` group can write to the drive, but everyone can still read from it.
Another option is to format the whole drive as ext4 so that you can set fine-grained permissions for every file and folder on there.  But that's probably overkill, and it prevents you from reading the drive from Windows.

My main concerns, which aren't addressed in the video, are: who pays for the storage space and the internet bandwidth needed to transmit the video?  Presumably, when the creator of the video leaves the community, someone else has to pay those costs.
I am generally aware of how BitTorrent works.  Is Alexandria just a new way to index interesting torrents and provide metadata about the creator so they can receive donations?  Can we say it's basically a decentralized The Pirate Bay?  I don't know how much this helps preserve anything; once all the seeders and leechers of the torrent go offline, it will probably be lost.

A bad random number generator will screw you up no matter how many addresses you are using.  The typical way that multiple-address wallets are implemented these days is that all the addresses are generated from a single random seed, so if that seed is bad then everything is compromised.
If you make new random numbers for every address, you still are vulnerable if the random number generator does not work.

I successfully verified it.  This works for me:
    wget 
    gpg --import 112E900E.asc
    wget 
    gpg --verify tothemoonguy.txt
The last command will have output like this:
    gpg: Signature made Mon 02 Nov 2015 05:48:07 PM PST using RSA key ID 112E900E
    gpg: Good signature from "ToTheMoonGuy (To the moon!!!) &lt;guy [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: A4E8 C00E 9C3E 1D35 4856  C6D0 E8AD EF00 112E 900E
If you want to get rid of that warning, you need to prepare your own primary key and then sign ToTheMoonGuy's key.  I forget how to prepare your own key but there are lots of tutorials.  For signing ToTheMoonGuy's key, you should probably use `lsign` (local sign) so that no one else will take that signature seriously.  Run `gpg --edit-key 112E900E` and then run the command `lsign` and answer the questions.
After doing that, the output should be:
    $ gpg --verify tothemoonguy.txt 
    gpg: Signature made Mon 02 Nov 2015 05:48:07 PM PST using RSA key ID 112E900E

It only matters when it was mined.  Every hour of the day, Gilfoyle has at least two choices:
1. Buy Bitcoin on an exchange, racking up credit card bills (or whatever).
2. Mine Bitcoin, racking up electricity bills.

I feel like GPG does too much; the whole web of trust thing was too idealistic and there never was a critical mass of people using GPG to make the web of trust work.
The [keybase.io]( model makes more sense for the modern world: I can trust a public key if it appears on a few of someone's accounts.  I don't need some cryptographic chain of trust going from me to them.

I think it's really hard to use the web of trust.  For example, I got an email from a stranger the other day, signed with his PGP key and encrypted with mine.  The web of trust doesn't connect us sufficiently for his key to be trusted.  So I don't know this person's legal identity, and I don't actually care.  But it would be nice if I can encrypt emails to him and have some assurance that I am using the same public key that I used last time, and not see warnings about the web of trust.  I think I can get what I want by adjusting GPG's `--trust-model` option so I will try that.
For more important emails, I would take additional precautions to verify the key, but it probably would not involve the web of trust.
I am trying to ask the following in a genuinely curious way and not be sarcastic or argumentative: has the web of trust feature helped you, and how?  Did it allow you to trust a key that you didn't verify in some other way outside the web of trust?

If you trust Reddit and trust that his account was not compromised, there is no need to verify the signature.  Otherwise, you need some independent, trusted source to tell you what his PGP public key is.  PGP has this "web of trust" thing that might help, but that's based on real names and emails, so I'm not sure it applies.  If he has other social media accounts he could post his public key fingerprint there, or he could contact you in person.

I believe it is pretty sketchy to install a certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities (like the Superfish program does), but some people think it's OK.  For example, there is a feature of [libwdi]( that generates a new certificate and installs it in that list, which allows the installation of unsigned USB drivers.  It might be safe if the private key is destroyed quickly, but it still seems sketchy to me and I wouldn't recommend it.  If the private key from that certificate gets leaked, then people can make fake HTTPS sites just like they can with Superfish.
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:34:18
That's good.  The algorithms running on Bitcoin nodes and miners don't really have a concept of any of the other types of consensus; they just care how much value is stored in each transaction output and what script you have to run to unlock it.
A lot of the alternative blockchain applications people talk about just seem to use the blockchain as a public storage space of binary data with verifiable timestamps, and the Bitcoin network does not help you achieve a consensus on what the binary data actually means.
