I'm a bit confused, could you maybe have a look at the transcation id 8e68ef53ef7d67707728c5b222841ea453054f2f4730623191beefdf0a5c932f.  Im sending 0.0016 but 0.0042 has come out of my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:52
aaah, thanks for going to the trouble of typing that out.  Wish I'd read it a few minutes ago.  I figured out the 0.002 was trusted coin but didnt know it was for the next 20 trans and i just sent all my coin to a new standard wallet.  Maybe its for the best anyways.
thanks again.

Im really confused now.  THis is the transaction id. 8e68ef53ef7d67707728c5b222841ea453054f2f4730623191beefdf0a5c932f
Im sending the 0.0016 amount but the amount deducted from my wallet is 0.0042, can anyone help me understand this because on 2nd glance it looks like the fee is only $11.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:15
the transaction is 
I'm using a 2fa electrum wallet and I just found out that the 2fa costs 0.002 bitcoin per transaction, or $50aud.  What the bloody hell.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:09
I think coinbase is having issues at the moment, some coin I sent from coinbase to local wallet a while back hasnt been submitted to the blockchain yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:29:31
Holy shit, I think its the 2fa electrum trusted coin fee.  Are they serious.
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:43:01
will do, thanks
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:59:01
We'll I guess last week was both the first and last time I use coin jar. It's a shame too because it was ridiculously simple compared to when I have bought bit coin in the past. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:18:07


Cheers, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:18:19
Thanks mate, Ill check it out.
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:52:25
Holy shit.  THanks for letting me know.  Do you have a link for the safest way to keep bitcoin.  I should know these things, the first time I bought bitcoin I bought 60 @ $5ea.  They all got stolen LOL.  
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:43:13
Hey folks if i have no need to access my coins for a bit.  Is it safe to just uninstall my wallets off the pc and then just write my seed phrase on a piece of paper and put it in a safe with my password?  Will that be all I need when I want to access the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:55:54
 Actually there's a shop just down the road that sells the Flexepin cards so that's probably a good option.  Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:54:44
Cheers mate, I'll check them out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:55:00
THanks mate.

HA Buy high and sell low has always been my way of doing business too.  I'll let you in on my expert run at bitcoin.
I started way back when bitcoin was $5.  I bought 60 at $5.00 each.  I then had 40 of them ripped off by some dude named Tony on the original Silk Road.  A while later I noticed the price of bitcoin was going up, it went up to about $200, I had no idea about local wallets or anything.  I bought a projector worth about $1500 with some of those leftover coins and lost the rest when Mt gox went bust.  
Now after they were $200 they came down again and at $70 I decided to buy $2000 worth, but being an absolute lunatic and not having faith in bitcoion at the time, when it later fell to $50 I sold them all hahah.  Buy high sell low baby.
So some time goes by and bitcoin is back at $600 now, wowsers.  I start buying again.  I get a few coins worth.  I then lose my job and have no option but to spend my only funds which are bitcoin, which by the way had fallen to $200 in the meantime.
So basically, of the 80 odd bitcoins Ive purchased over the years, that have a value of over $800k in local currency, I have a crappy, outdated projector and a couple of humble bundles to show for it.
LOL .... kill me.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:56:30
Yeah thats why I'm trying to jump back in again.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:43:51
Sheeet get with the times bro.  Here in Australia were about to bust down the 17k barrier.  $16.9 atm.
edit - and its 17!
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:39:43
What about exodus? is it safe?  I like it because of how many coins it supports.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:56:09
Cheers mate.
@_date: 2019-02-28 01:31:29
hmm...thanks for the info.  I used to use electrum but it only supports bitcoin afaik.  Are there any that you would recommend that support the top 5 coins in 1 desktop app?
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:05:59
Wait...how? I had a couple of coins on mt gox but never bothered putting in a claim because I thought they were paying cash value at the time which was like $10.
Should I have receieved an email or something?
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:13:37
I dont even know what KYC is so its unlikely.
I did just search my email and theres half a dozen withdrawl notifications after the last time I used the account so I guess I was personally hacked as well and jsut realised so its unlikely the coins wer even there at the time of the big hack.
Man a couple of bitcoin would be life changing at the moment. LOL.  I could buy a house with the amount of coin I got scammed out of in the early days.  We live and learn I gues.
Thanls for the response.
@_date: 2019-09-15 06:17:39
LOL, must have been about the same time I got robbed of my last 60 bitcoin on the original silk road.
Man I'd be so happy if that guy returned even one of those coins.  Sometimes I get hella depresses about it thinking its enough for a house now but then I realise that even if it hadn't been robbed it wouldve just got me high and would still be gone.
One way or another those coins would be gone.
@_date: 2019-09-15 08:26:14
I think I FE'd to take advantage of a sale or some shit.  It was like one of the first big vendor scams.  Tony76 or someshit his name was.
we live and learn
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:38:43
Yeah I bought 30 bc's at $4 each yonks ago and was left with 10 after I spent some, then I totaly forgot about what I thought was about $40 worth of bc.  I could not for the life of me work out what on earth happened when i checked it recently and saw they were worth over $2000.
Anyways, I'll let you know when mine gets verified, if you could do the same that'd be great.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:41:52
No my Mt Gox isnt verified, just waiting for the bank account to  be verified.
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:03:46
Lol yeah fair enough. In that case I'm out $800 that I wanted to buy luxury electronic goods with. 
In reality tho, if we want bitcoin to grow we cant really promote it by saying "buy bitcoin it's great, just not too much, it's not very secure, not more than your willing to lose"
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:23:19
No I couldn't, I chose the only option available to Australians at the time.  Please get your facts straight before commenting.
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:31:58
Yes this is a lesson that I'm desperately hoping hasn't cost me $800 to learn.
It's funny tho, I made two withdrawls a few days apart.  The $40 transaction was in my account 2 days later, the $800 tho has now been missing for 19 days.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:07:36
It's irrelevant what he did.  The issue isn't that they have banned him from the service, they don't even need a reason to do that.  The issue is that they are keeping his funds.
Even if he broke their TOS 10 times over they have no right to keep his coins.
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:29:43
My problem is that they aren't holding themselves accountable.  It was their job to make sure the money made it to my bank account, but they basically have given it to Technocash, a company that was being investigated and probably had already had its accounts seized or frozen, and they think thats them completing their part of the deal.
I am a client of Mt Gox, not Technocash.  Mt Gox needs to do something about this, as I'm sure Im not the only person affected.
Like you said, I will definately be using a different method in future.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:57:49
Man, fuck you guys for having a life that allows you to sit on the beach and eat bitcoin purchased burritos on your lunch break.  FML
@_date: 2013-06-11 06:40:30
Thanks for the reply. That's crazy. 
The funny thing is I did another transfer the week before on 22nd of may and it took 2 days. It was in my account on 24th. 
Mt gox actually say it should be in my bank from the 4th of June so I'm going to call the bank in about an hour.  All I can think of is that mt gox put some 0 's at the start of my bank acct number so maybe something's gone wrong. It didn't effect it last time tho. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:35:24
Can anyone explain what the deal was with that tony76 Silk Road scam?
I lost 20 coins to that guy when he disappeared and just figured he ripped us all off. Was there more to it than that?
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:10:10
Thanks for the help guys, the coins did turn up at Mt Gox.  Perhaps I was just being paranoid.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:09:59
a salty dildo... teehee
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:32:45
Hi, thanks for the reply.  Thats what I did, I put a zero at the start of my CBA account.  
Do you remember how long it took for Mt Gox to actually verify the account?  Because at this stage I cant start the transfer as the bank account is unverified.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:21:22
where do you see the queue?
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:19:08
Im not sure if theres much of a community for doing that here in brisbane australia.  I did get a reply from Mt Gox support ticket very quickly tho and theyve given me some info i can take to my bank.
@_date: 2013-06-09 13:10:41
Yep, thanks MittenZz, this has now been done.
@_date: 2013-06-18 07:11:48
So youve got their address, go get your shit back.  If its many thousands of dollars youve lost I'm sure you can find someone in your town that'll kick a door in for $500.
edit - this is also why I'd never use paypal for any large payments, they are crooks as much as the guy taht robbed you.
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:25:16
But it was Mt Gox responsibilty to get the money to me.  If I owe you money I can't give it to a friend to deliver to you and then say, oops sorry my friend got arrested and the money was seized but I did give it to him so my obligations are fulfilled.  I'm sure you wouldn't accept that.
@_date: 2013-06-09 11:08:40
I made a withdrawal on the 29th of May, that statement was made on the 4th of June and says that it wont come into effect until the 15th of June.  I don't see how that could apply to me and if it does then Mt Gox was very late in issuing that statement.
On mt gox it says the withdrawl has been processed.
Thanks for your response.
@_date: 2013-06-17 18:27:20
No, once again you are wrong. I never asked or authorised for my money to be given to anyone but myself, and no-where on the mt gox website does it say they give your money to a 3rd party when you try to withdraw. I had no idea who techno cash was until ihad to start investigating where my money went. 
I am a client of Mt gox, no one else. It's their responsibility and if they choose to do business with criminal enterprises I don't see why I should be penalised. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:13:49
Yes that's right so your initial comment is out of context. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 08:36:18
I bet they'd still let you deposit a large sum without verifying. 
Happy to take your funds, not so happy about giving them back. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 13:08:27
Thanks for the response.
Its things like this that really make me wary of putting any real money into bitcoin.  I mean I can give Mt Gox my money easily enough, I can move bitcoins around easily and buy things with bitcoin, but then not being able to cash out a measley $800 without the worry of it just disappearing is stressful.
The fact that they take so long to reply to emails if they reply at all is also of concern.
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:59:56
I don't think so, I think that might be Kogan.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:44:44
how do tips work? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 08:59:39
Well I think 5% is ok for the current risk of accepting bitcoin.  I'm willing to spend that.  I just want to be sure that these guys are legit and I will actually get the item.
@_date: 2013-04-17 09:45:33
Hi thzanks for the post.  Can you please explain where you get this info, specifically the buy wall and how to interpret it, if its not too much trouble?
I bought at $55 yesterday and then freaked out and sold at $57 lol.
