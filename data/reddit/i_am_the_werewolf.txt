Blockchain.info has been down for some hours now. Maybe that is related?

Hell, I did read it again. Pretty succinct.

Thanks, I will continue to monitor!

the micro transactions push the price back and forth. there's a bit of resonance before a huge ask is pushed through to max out that resonance to new lows. That what i see as a layman using star trek terminology.

buy and hold until you know what you're doing with trading. there's a steep learning curve and if you're not careful you can lose btc to price fluctuations and trading fees. there's lots of patterns to find, and no one likes to give out their tips on what they've found.

People lost a lot of money from getting burned the other day. Let them lick their wounds and whimper before coming back to the trading table.

How bout you get off your high horse and enjoy the ride? There's a rally going on, if you expect talk of anything else there are plenty of other forums to do so in. As it is, this is a popular trendy site, what else do you expect? 
Or do you just want to show how cool and professional you are through this event?
These whining post are more annoying than any meme.

Thanks for the update, it is back for me as well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:44:14
keep trying, it's up for me now.

It can be imo, considering that newer technologies might come out to replace the btc. 5-10 years is a long time to let any tech stagnate, especially a technology based off of the internet. That being said, I really hope you're right. I'd like to clear my debt ASAP!

I'm not familiar with metals investments, but I do hear a lot in the tech community about rare earths becoming more and more needed for our technological devices. 
With venture capitalists looking to asteroids to mine rare earths, I can only imagine the price going up on metals like silver, gold, platinum, etc. and the need for rare earths is there.
I'm excited to see where we will be in the next two decades. Both with my investments and with the development of our global community.

Stupid people get burnt whether something is said or not, that's why they're stupid.

Neo-Hong Kong. I think that term comes from an anime?
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:23:24
When would it go from interesting to concerning? I would imagine they'd need a larger share of the overall mining pool? Or am I completely misunderstanding this?

That this is happening in my lifetime is surreal. Is this a common issue or has this not happened since the 30's?

Listen, We all don't like to see things we don't like. But this is the internet. You have to be pragmatic in this sense. Yes, I know you feel some type of ownership to but the hivemind is the true owner. If you really don't like to see the image macros then you can setup reddit to not show image macros.
Stop complaining and do something about it. Don't demand the internet to change to your vision, adjust your vision to not see what you don't want to see.

Except it can happen in this case. the infrastructure is there, once the btc settles down people can actually spend it. 
I have faith this will happen because of several reasons. One reason is SR isn't going away, in fact, it is growing. SR's success is tied to the btc until they start accepting other crypto-currencies as it's staple.
I agree with you though that Lentil-Soup's hope is unlikely to happen. The question is, how much of the other fiat currencies will get absorbed into the btc before the btc stabilizes? My guess is well over the btc's current rate.

This holds true to shaky hand speculators, the real speculators made away with some huge gains today. I made .54 btc from this, it'll go a long way down the line.
I'm a small fry so don't crucify me! my 1 and 2 btc trades don't make or break the btc.

Thanks for your comment, it has reassured me that I'm not some bad leech on btc's.
