I know, that makes it very difficult to measure. Will think about changing the headline.

Hm. Does the formulation of the headline cause the problem or do you think the description should be altered too. I see where you are going.

Added. Thank you!

Hm. Why is that data in a blockchain not distributed? If I run a full node, would I not have all data about the transactions? (Let's not get confused with SegWit data storage mechanisms; just the transactions / hashes)




I see.




Yeah, that is a hard one. We wanted to emphasize that a user (many users associate with "code" def. something else as you probably do) is aware of the quality of a blockchain's implementation. 




I agree. However, isn't ZCash, PIVX and Monero on a good trajectory and would you agree, that there are some more anonymous and some less anonymous blockchains?
