And who exactly founded bch?

Oh look I saw that Lightning video, it shows how cheap and easy it will be when it comes out in 2083

If LN comes out in two years and doesn’t work which means BTC won’t explode would you think these guys missed an opportunity back before the hard fork? Would you be happy to see another coin overtake yours, just because of bad decisions made on the basis of propaganda? Would you admit it was a toxic atmosphere and highly regarded developers, who were there from early days, were shunned? It’s a double edged sword you are going by, when it didn’t always have to be that way. 
Oh, I agree with your point about coding though
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:02:43
Totally agreed about being toxic on both sides, that is actually what I meant to say
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:34:26
To me that would sound about right. I would imagine the majority are from the early days. Can’t over emphasise how importantly you must treat your keys since you are your own bank

Always presume your computer is compromised. Buy a trezor or ledger wallet. Both are decent. Don’t know of any other type. Good investment if you plan on keeping money long term

Buy a hardware wallet

Yeah I think alot of people got burned bad last week. Thats why everyone should make their own minds up themselves. A fool parts with his money easily
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:21:25
No I do get it, but I’m just wondering do you? If you spent 200 dollars on a transaction would that make it even more secure than one that cost 30 dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:13
But can you actually explain to me just how it is more secure? I don’t mean an opinion from some other user on reddit, I mean can you actually tell me what makes a bitcoin transaction more secure than either any other transaction on a blockchain or a bank transfer? I’m all for cryptos, you think I’m against you...I’m actually not. But I’m just not happy about big fees (I can totally understand them if they guaranteed a 1 minute transaction) but anything longer than that should never be over a dollar. It’s just a rip off
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:02:29
How does the 30 dollars price tag make it more secure than a transaction on dash or litecoin?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:58:29
Why would any sane person want to pay 30 dollars for a transaction? That spends an eternity in the mempool? Do you actually realise what you are saying? I get it, we all want crypto to work, but let’s not lose the plot and talk silly
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:52:42
Yeah I’ve had this thought too. Maybe I am wrong but imagine in 50 years time one bitcoin is worth one million dollars (or any amount really). The majority of people have been hodling it for years. Now they decide to sell as it has reached their target value. All of a sudden a load of bitcoin is dumped on the market, dropping the value alot. All of this presumes that there will still be fiat currency, and bitcoin has some percentage of use higher than now. Is there something I’m missing out on? Can someone please explain this to me? I feel I am asking a pretty dumb question here, so take i easy on me!!

Any person who buys or sells through one of those companies where you need to show id is only looking for trouble. Face to face with people. Might take more time, but safer in the long run
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:59:06
So I guess it’s just a matter of hodling on for the ride!
