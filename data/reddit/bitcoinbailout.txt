Not sure if this will be helpful, but as previously suggested, narrowing down the topic might help. One of the best economic lectures I've listened to pertaining to money itself was called "The Cultural Consequences of Fiat Money" (looking at the social impact). Might give some ideas.

You must have forgotten or fail to realize how the system was designed in the first place. Only after wider adoption and greater liquidity is realized will the volatility decrease to the point of reasonable stability. In terms of percentage it already has been decreasing compared to early days. Stability comes later.

EDIT: Title change to: Greece *Will* Close Banks to Stem Flood of Withdrawals
"If the Greek government closes the banks and imposes so-called currency controls, it would be taking steps similar to those by Cyprus in 2013 to avoid a bank collapse. But in that case, the Cypriot government acted in concert with other European governments as part of a new bailout program. In Greece, the emergency banking measures would be a result of a breakdown in talks with other eurozone countries. The breakdown has intensified pressure on cash-poor banks as jittery Greeks withdraw their savings."
Update: Also from Bloomberg "The ECB views a bank holiday as necessary because the amount of emergency liquidity available to banks is insufficient to cover their needs, a person familiar with the matter says." 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:26:17
It is worth noting the comparison to Cyprus. BTC spiked during that period. The good thing about BTC is that no bank can close your account or freeze your funds ;)

The object is to ride the trend whose premise is false and step off before discredited. In the case of our current monetary paradigm, it's nearly impossible to time when the manipulators will lose control of the ship and process can take many years.
So, if history is any guide, the fate of our fiat monetary system (applying Occams Razor)  will be similar to all those that came before it. The major risk here is that most major central banks around the globe have adopted similar policies. Unprecedented.

I think it's in the FAQ on Bitcoin.org but I could be wrong. Long story short, if Bitcoin is still around in 2140 and has completed its S curve progression of adoption, the transaction fees alone would justify their economic existence.

There has been doubt expressed that the Lightning Network can provide adequate scaling for mass adoption without also increasing the blocksize of Bitcoin. There are also limitations on what LN channels can and cannot do, and what is required to set one up. This paper proposes an intermediate layer between the Bitcoin blockchain and Lightning Network channels that alleviates both problems.

I think it's been established that you don't need electricity to exchange ownership. I can give my paper wallet to you, for instance.

It is manipulation of interest rates as the MARKET sets them (in this case by a central bank) that results in bubbles and bailouts.
This is true free market money, man. Please understand this.

Don't confuse capitalism with corporatism. The failures you've observed in the States are the cause of aggressive nationalism &amp; imperialism together with domination of the economy by the State.

Once the deflationary appetite of merchants reaches that of the many users that own them, then you will see the potential for even LOWER prices from merchants that will accept Bitcoin. 
Today even those that accept Bitcoin (with a few exceptions such as Overstock) will instantly covert to fiat to avoid the volatility. So forget "rewarding" those merchants right now. 
This article is still very true. 
It's just unfortunate the masses are economically illiterate to be able to think critically and respond to threads such as these.

I can understand how that's difficult to foresee today. You apparently assume that Bitcoin will be banned and not widely considered an accepted form of payment, is that right? I however believe that Bitcoin will be as common as the PayPal options you see today when making online purchases. I assume that companies will be able (and eventually very willing) to integrate Bitcoin even if they are regulated. 
Eventually the State will have to concede that attempts to control cryptocurrencies are futile and why there will be an extreme push to focus on taxation based on consumption for revenue.  


Great point.
One more bit on your point of gold avoidance. Gold is manipulated with the rest of the current markets. Eventually people will wake up and see how free market money can and does work. 
EDIT: It will be considered politically unfavorable to take an anti-Bitcoin stance after the dominos start to fall and we introduce a new generation of people who no longer trust the central banks. Central planning and manipulation of interest rates WILL (eventually) be seen widely as a failure (some of us would argue it already has failed). 
EDIT 2: Also should mention that there will be more friction in certain countries than others. Important as time goes on to remember this is a global marketplace figuring out what to make of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This is an Austrian economists wet dream unfolding before our very eyes. I am eager to see how things progress over the coming decades.
