Before you buy any crypto, it may be worth checking out if it's bullish or bearish. One of the tools I use is Galaxy Score. It's free and available on this website: [ (it's just a bt/usd market but you can choose others).

As far as I know, CoinDeal is available in Quatar. Also, I'd recommend having a SegWit address there - it gives you a 50% discount on bitcoin withdrawals.

Well, yeah, most of the exchangers actually demand a lot of time and knowledge to buy crypto. I started exchanging with coindeal because it had a user-friendly interface and I stuck to it. Also, I heard it announced a mobile app being available soon, so it'll be even easier to buy bitcoin.

Nostalgia strikes hard. Jk, I didn't buy bitcoin early enough :p

Maybe in 10 years' time? It's just speculating at this point. For now, I mostly use my credit card to buy bitcoin on cantors like buycoinnow and some altcoins on others. Once I don't have to bother using cards though, I'm going to drop centralized banks once and for all.

I heard it somewhere deep in my soul.

Some exchange platforms allow its users to pay indirectly and not via debit/credit card. For example, on coindeal you can buy via skrill, dotpay, epay.

Just for the record, as far as I know, CoinDeal has no limits when it comes to buying BTC. Also, it has free deposits via bank transfer of 5 fiats.

I relate to this, or should I say "I used to" relate to it. I had no knowledge when and which alts to buy, so I ended up buying some BTC. Now the exchange platform, that I chose, gave its users a chance to use Galaxy Score. It's a tool that measures various factors and then tells you the condition of a coin, basically giving you info when to buy/sell/hold. So, thanks to coindeal, I now have some altcoins in my portfolio as well :).

First of all - learn about BTC before you start buying. You're an easy target for scammers, as we've all been at some point. When you feel comfortable with your knowledge make a decision which crypto exchanger to use. If I were you, I'd choose something safe, so my pick would be [CoinDeal]( I don't want to overwhelm you with info about it but let's just say that 90% of cryptos are held in cold wallets and this platform has a Swiss VQF license. 
For now, I'd recommend you reading about crypto and constantly checking out what's happening on BTC-related forums. Best of luck and welcome to the big word of cryptocurrency!
