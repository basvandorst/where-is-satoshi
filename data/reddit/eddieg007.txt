Why would you want to put bitcoin in an IRA?
You only pay capital gains on bitcoin when you sell it. And unless the tax for capital gains changes - that is paid at a lower rate than regular income tax. 
Any money in an IRA is taxed at regular income tax rates when you withdraw it - so you would pay a lot more tax when the time comes provided bitcoin has gone up in value. 
There's no real advantage to using an Ira for investing in bitcoin.

Maybe you should also consider hanging out with different sorts of people as part of your security plan in addition to the being an asshole and a douche defense strategy.

If you live in the US, in a community property state, assets you bring into the marriage are separate unless you co-mingle them (like put them in a joint account) or after marriage contribute more to the asset from joint funds. 
I'd suggest before going through pre-nup first learn the laws already in place. 
Don't know about non-community property states as I haven't had experience with them.

I think the benefit is still debatable since if bitcoin grows it will have to become less volatile which means over the long term the growth in value will decrease or plateau.  Meaning, you're limiting the growth of your retirement. Also since the only way to realize the gain is to sell it - your original investment can not perpetually generate gains to live off in retirement like dividend stocks or bonds could. 
With dividend stocks or interest paying bonds the principle ideally remains intact kicking out income you can live off. And ideally setting you up in retirement with a perpetual income. With bitcoin once you start taking it out you are drawing down the investments.
