Looks like they added it back?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:05:17
All my stuff still up. I guess I didn’t use the right trigger words?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:22:10
Can Bcash implement segwit / LN?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:27:53
yeah I guess it is something different. I was thinking of BitGirls. The article gives no links though and google is not helpful. Where can I learn more about this group?

He thinks FUD in actually influences the price
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:08:04
Please use LiveCoinWatch instead. Better interface, and bitcoin links do not go to bcash links
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:27:28
How?! This is ant-fud!
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:22:47
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:03:22
This - it works pretty well
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:48:10
ok done.

I spent all my “can afford to lose money” dedicated to crypto back when it was 17K. Wish I could
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:09:26
Boy I’d love to, as soon as they verify me. Been about 4 weeks now(?) even opened case with customer support, let them know I wanted to jump from coinbase.. didn’t really help.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:13:01
Someone just put bitcoin over a template which can be used for anything “fighting the power” its overtly edgy, thus it belongs in @_date: 2018-01-09 16:39:44
Bitcoincore.org lists Gemini as segwit ready?
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:48:54
I laugh when I see 17% losses now. My portfolio is uh..kinda negative, but hey, not a loser unless I selll!
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:47:29
Pretending to represent bitcoin, but they represent bitcoin cash and slander bitcoin on a daily basis. An account FOR something usually doesn’t attack itself. Bringing context to this particular twitter post, is dominated by bitcoin cash (to bring more confusion to it).
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:44:59
*knock* *knock* it’s the IRS!
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:02:48
I invested in the December rush, and have had 2 nightmares so far that I can remember.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:27:59
That’s pretty damn funny!
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:43:59
A grip of what? My composure, or this other guy in the circle?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:27:27
I asked specifically this and I am not banned
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:22:19
What’s childish? Reporting an account that pretends to be the most official bitcoin account but then spreads word against it to shill another currency? This is called tricking people. Crypto is blowing up, people are learning and don’t know what to think. The account owner doesn’t represent the currency, it represents a competitor. It’s “Coke got an upgrade and it’s called Pepsi.” - from a coke account. Reporting this account is what needs to be done. Why didn’t I think of this sooner?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:01:02
Curse you! *shakes fist*
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:59:52
You are very smart
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:45:18
I get this reference
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:47:54
Roger is like the anti-pope
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:24:35
And then it goes to 0.0001 :(
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:26:06
Isn’t the message board 2 still referring to bitcoin.com?
Edit: yes it is. Message board 2 still links to forum.bitcoin.com
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:59:02
I was actually working on a crypto tracking google extension with my buddy, but now it feels like everyone and their mother is making one, and suddenly I am demotivated... 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:53:45
No we don’t!
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:06:57
I rate this dip — bitcoin out of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:32:05
Not the twitter though, thankfully.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:51:39
I knew this was going to turn into a meme..
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:30:52
Guess who’s pretending to be?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:05:30
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:40:33
It’s too expensive? What? You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, and it all turns relative to how much you invest. The machinations of this have no similarities to a pyramid scheme. I buy, i sell. I don’t have to ask 3 friends to buy from me. You’re nonsense.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:29:51
Ok, phising? That’s a little much.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:26:19
I thought it was funny.. :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:20
Not in here, buddy!
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:30:52
like bcash? lol
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:13:41
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:09:29
The thought crossed my mind!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:00:40
There’s no reason for it to be up, there’s no reason for it to be down, there’s no reason it can’t be a shark. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:48
It’s ... JAMMED!
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:54:43
The show ended in march 2017, kinda old news. I’m trying to see if the “leader” really did represent bcash, or if that’s just bitcoin.com being themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:39:53
Hey you did a good job
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:45:47
you know, I think so too!
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:47:28
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:51:31
I’m still waiting to get verified there.. week 3!
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:01:10
I mean when Pepsi hard forked from carbonated beverages, they increased the sweetness, which Coke failed to do. It’s basically an upgrade, right?
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:28:12
While I admit I'm a bit pissed at how the bitcoin twitter account is attacking bitcoin, I feel like in the past week people have been calling for absolute witch hunts way more than is necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:28:24
Why doesn’t bitcoin.org “come with the twitter handle”?
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:26:29
What you mean Bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:19:53
How did bcash get their hands on the bitcoin.com domain?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:58:50
Good shark bot
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:23:19
you know, maybe some people *deserve* lambos more than the people who can afford them
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:16:22
if you fly to the sun you do not freeeeeeeze
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:26:49
your attitude is lame
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:01:19
I hope you are having a wonderful day! these sure look neat!
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:40:22
you are right! well now *I'm* triggered too!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:11
are you joking?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:05:40
ok thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:09:17
By 'drop sales' I thought you meant take it off the exchange, so sorry.
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:37:09
I remember when they did this before, and then it was back in a couple of days.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:11:30
No no no. You get 10,000 cents for sending $1
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:30:35
no thanks - hodling
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:30:20
Oh yeah? According to who, “experts”?
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:33:33
is leaking again..
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:55:22
The global what?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:22:53
Ok you pass.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:18:17
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:43:11
Finish your sentence what? Complete your thoughts please
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:04:07
It is finished.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:59:17
what kind of a business is it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:44:36
Not 16? Well do you at least have an article on medium
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:45:00
plagiarized it? wait what happened with that girl?
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:26:12
it just went down. thanks
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:09:53
“Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will take over the global cryptocurrencies”??
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:47:18
Now what?
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:01:47
is this a meme now?
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:41:00
just use livecoinwatch
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:51:20
Their trend seems to be in line with btc(?)
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:48:26
what I really like are all of the twitter scam accounts replying to Roger's tweets pretending to be Roger and telling people he's doing an ETH giveaway.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:35:42
Yes, they are
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:12:12
You’re thinking of   is still a shill
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:54:49
LOL you seem to have forgotten a certain spike that happened last christmas. You are not allowed to cry.
