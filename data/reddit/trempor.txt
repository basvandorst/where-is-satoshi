But if the law says that for a certain crime a certain punishment shall be given, then it's not really "interpretation" if the court decides to ignore the law, is it? In that case the court makes up its own laws, and that sounds pretty undemocratic to me.
Let's assume that the people want to legalize pot, and elect an legistlation that does just that. Would you be OK if a judge continued to hand out pot related life-sentences because he/she feels like that's more just? Do you really want to give so much power to a single judge? And wouldn't that make the law completely arbitrary since depending on which judge you face, you may get any possible sentence, ranging from going free to the death penalty? Isn't it nice to know in advance what kind of punishment you can expect for a given crime?
Also, most courts absolutely do not have authority to determine if a law is constitutional or not. That's what you have the supreme court for.

So what exactly is the job of the legislature if not to write laws that the judicial use in their work?

No, but in this case he actually did knowingly supply money to drug traffickers. So there's that going against him...

Can we get a Hitler-fallacy-fallacy? Just because X can be used legally does not make a person using X a non-criminal.
It is legal to buy a potato with BTC. It is not legal to buy drugs with BTC. It is legal to supply BTC to potato-resellers (given you have the correct paperwork). It is not legal to supply BTC to drug traffickers.

Tell me more about how the government banning cash, which the government has a monopoly on, is bad for decentralization?
