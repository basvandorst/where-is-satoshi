I haven't actually done any payments yet, and I'm not going to, I'm just going to see what this email says and then bail.

*EDIT* I received the email. It's a money order for $990 that I can cash out at the post office. I really can't see this being a scam because I can either get it deposited into my bank account or get it as cash on hand, so if I wanted I could just take this $990 and run.

They've told me that my bank account doesn't participate in the task, it's just that the transfer is made in my name. Thoughts?
"Your bank account does not participate in the financial task, the transfer is made in your name"
I'm not sure if that makes it MORE sketchy or more legit.

Hahaha yeah I'd be able to move to Japan after half a year with what they're offering to pay easily. Funnily enough, that's actually the only country other than Australia that I'd want to live in.

Okay, just read up on the most common money laudering schemes and it described literally exactly what I am doing. Luckily I haven't actually done any transactions yet, so I'm safe. I blocked everyone I was in contact with and closed the bank accounts that I provided them with. Fuck that noise, I'm out.

They're sending me the details for the first transaction I'm supposed to be making today, depending on how fishy the details are I'm either going to bail or stay, I'll tell you what they ask me to do. 
But good thinking, I didn't even think of the possibility of them laundering money. Cheers.

Okay, I'll ask them why they don't have one big company account.

What questions?
Ask them if they are legit or not? Well if they are legit, 
they'd say they are legit, and if they aren't legit, they'd still say they are legit. No point.
