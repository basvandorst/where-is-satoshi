51% attack is a [technical term](


AntPool has 18%, BTC.com has 15.5%. [source](


That's not how it works. Bitcoin's low throughput is a design issue, not a hardware. All the processing can be done on an office PC and all the mining farms are just a security measure(quorum on validity of transactions based on proof of work).




Which requires... hashpower bringing us back to a single-threaded solution. 
Jeez, man, RTFM before posting.

There are 10 places in Iran where you can use BTC [according to coinmap]( and half of them are exchanges.


Well, I've sent some money recently from Russia to Ukraine while there are sanctions and restrictions on transfers due to Crimea and stuff with mastercard / VK card2card. It was a no-fee 10 second transaction.

Sounds like a way to become singnificantly more vulnerable to 51% attacks.

* 50000% = 500 times
* that's ROI on his investments(probably 10% or less), not total wealth
Still a lot but not 50K times.

Government to which you pay taxes does.


Oh, right. The thing is that even Russia has universal healthcare with $8B / year spending while US doesn't despite spending two orders of magnitude more money($1.1T). American system is inefficient and just a waste of resources.


Single payer system helps those who can afford private healthcare:
* less public money gets spent on treating poor since government doesn't have to cover profit margins for private businesses through programs like medicaid
* private healthcare providers have to increase their quality of service and lower prices since they have to compete with completely free(for the end user) government system
