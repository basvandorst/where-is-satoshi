payza, you mean the merchant processor that turned over existing disputes to the Department of Justice after the silk road collapse?
I would personally stay away, as I'm still fighting for $1400 of bitcoin return, but your mileage may vary.

I ordered one myself when the Jalepeno was on sale for $149. I think it was around January. 
I haven't been waiting a year, but some time. i just got the confirmation letter saying my order was in final processing. ( i.e. it uses more power than we anticipated and needs a bigger case, press ok to start printing money)
They offered a refund in my order confirmation 12 days ago. I declined.

I deposited ~2BTC into BTC-e. Sold my coins, and used payza for their withdraw service. I now have some fiat currency in payza, and they suspended wire payments.

I withdrew fiat via payza today. Took a week to process the deposit, but I've never had issues with btc-e. Sorry :(

explain it like I'm 5. I have a coinbase account. Can I wire money from Payza to Coinbase?

somebody explain to me why we should care about the price on gox, when they've suspended all USD withdraws, and are so behind in manual wire transfers, that you cannot withdraw from gox theoretically until summer 2015?

they've completely frozen all US privileges it looks like. no prepaid for me.
