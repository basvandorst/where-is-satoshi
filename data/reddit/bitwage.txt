Yup, you don't need to ask your employer to get your salary in BTC or ETH. For employees/freelancers/gig workers, the process looks like this:  
1. New user signs up to Bitwage and specifies what % of salary he/she wants to receive in BTC / ETH /fiat.   
2. Bitwage generates new bank account for the user.  
3. User provides new bank details to their employer/client.  
4. User receives a % of salary/wage in BTC and/or ETH directly to their wallet and/or % of salary/wage directly to personal bank account.

@_date: 2014-12-11 20:52:22
Jonathan from Bitwage here.  The way it works is that you sign up to our service and we provide you with an account to provide to your payroll provider as one of your banking accounts.  Many payroll providers allow you to have two accounts, one for checking and another for savings.  With our service, you would use one account for your fiat wage and the other account for your bitcoin wage.  The service is wallet agnostic and you can change your percent preferences on the fly.  Check out our website at [Bitwage.co](

You would actually choose to have part of your salary send to us.  When you work with a payroll provider, as an employee, you are typically allotted two banking accounts to send money to (in theory, 1 for checking and 1 for savings).  You would use our bank account information for one of these accounts, assign the percentage of the net pay you want turned into bitcoins and the only amount forwarded to us is what you want for Bitcoins.
The main advantages are that you get to use whatever wallet you want (We do not hold any bitcoins on our service, we are purely transactional), you are not required to have a bank account prior to obtaining your bitcoins, you receive your bitcoins next day, and the only limits to the transactions are your payrolls :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:39:32
We are purely transactional, meaning that we send to whatever wallet address you want, from Coinbase and Blockchain to paper wallets.  You name it!
The fees will be very competitive.  A percentage capped at a low number.  Our fees will be finalized while in Beta.
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:13:42
Right now, it's just a push from the employer to the employees, but the ability of the employee to pull (send payment request) to employer is something we want to implement soon, especially because of its utility for 1099 contract workers.
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:47:14

We cannot transact more money than we have assets to cover in the event of a disaster such as the shutdown of an exchange during our activity on it. Therefore, our initial product will be available to a limited amount of people and its availability will grow as our assets increase (through investment, retained earnings, or if insurance products are made available to us). We plan to have a 'proof of reserves' mechanism for this.
We are focusing on California due to favorable regulations (AB 786...), but we are also looking into other states with high bitcoin activity such as NY, Texas, and Kansas. We are proactively complying with FinCEN regulation ahead of regulatory clarity; we have an early stage AML policy that meets FinCEN standards. We plan to continually update the AML policy as we mature.
We estimate our price right now to be around 1-1.5% on top of exchange costs, and they will be transparent.

There are tons of traditional payroll providers for all sizes of businesses and business needs. The more mentioned providers are SAP, Oracle PeopleSoft, ADP,  TriNet, and QuickBooks. For our Fiat-&gt;Bitcoin payroll software product, we require the post-tax salary data of each participating employee, and we can receive this manually or automatically. If done automatically, different payroll providers have different integration methods. QuickBooks, for example, has a Partner Platform which includes an API that our software can query.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:51:55
We are able to accept any amount of bitcoin or USD and send out any mixture of bitcoin or USD (Check or Direct Deposit). As we mentioned previously, the service will not offer payroll tax calculation or withholding, and therefore you will have to pay employees as contractors (1099) or if as employees (W2), you must do the tax calculation and withholding elsewhere. However, we plan for tax and benefits to be available by the end of the year.

The IRS states that, "The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done."  However, every state will have different definitions and interpretations for an "independent contractor".
For instance, in California there is no set definition of the term "independent contractor" and as such, one must look to the interpretations of the courts and enforcement agencies to decide if in a particular situation a worker is an employee or independent contractor. In handling a matter where employment status is an issue, that is, employee or independent contractor, DLSE starts with the presumption that the worker is an employee. Labor Code Section 3345.  This is a rebuttable presumption however, and the actual determination of whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor depends upon a number of factors, all of which must be considered, and none of which is controlling by itself. Consequently, it is necessary to closely examine the facts of each service relationship and then apply the law to those facts. For most matters before the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), depending on the remedial nature of the legislation at issue, this means applying the "multi-factor" or the "economic realities" test adopted by the California Supreme Court in the case of S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v Dept. of Industrial Relations (1989) 48 Cal.3d 341. In applying the economic realities test, the most significant factor to be considered is whether the person to whom service is rendered (the employer or principal) has control or the right to control the worker both as to the work done and the manner and means in which it is performed. Additional factors that may be considered depending on the issue involved are:
1. Whether the person performing services is engaged in an occupation or business distinct from that of the principal;
2. Whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal or alleged employer;
3. Whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place for the person doing the work;
4. The alleged employee’s investment in the equipment or materials required by his or her task or his or her employment of helpers;
5. Whether the service rendered requires a special skill;
6. The kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision;
7. The alleged employee’s opportunity for profit or loss depending on his or her managerial skill;
8. The length of time for which the services are to be performed;
9. The degree of permanence of the working relationship;
10. The method of payment, whether by time or by the job; and
11. Whether or not the parties believe they are creating an employer-employee relationship may have some bearing on the question, but is not determinative since this is a question of law based on objective tests.
Even where there is an absence of control over work details, an employer-employee relationship will be found if (1) the principal retains pervasive control over the operation as a whole, (2) the worker’s duties are an integral part of the operation, and (3) the nature of the work makes detailed control unnecessary. (Yellow Cab Cooperative v. Workers Compensation Appeals Board (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1288)
Other points to remember in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor are that the existence of a written agreement purporting to establish an independent contractor relationship is not determinative (Borello, Id.at 349), and the fact that a worker is issued a 1099 form rather than a W-2 form is also not determinative with respect to independent contractor status. (Toyota Motor Sales v. Superior Court (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 864, 877)
Second, several cases have been brought in the start-up and small business context where ICs were designated. In California, the courts lean toward the employee and many times find the party was not an IC. 
Please consult your attorney for definitions, interpretations and regulations outside of California.  Also note that we are not tax authorities, so make sure to look up any applicable rules and regulations yourself.  We highly advise you to follow all the tax regulations and we are not liable for penalties associated with you not following them.

We are working on solutions for both Europe and Canada.  We are hoping to offer these services early in 2015.
@_date: 2014-07-02 06:13:53
We are working on a solution for this, planned to be available by the end of the year.  Currently, employers are able to pay workers as 1099 contractors.  This means the employer does not have to perform any sort of tax calculations.  However, the employee will want to pay normal income tax based off of the value of the Bitcoins they received upon payday (which will be easily available through our portal).  Employers can also use our alpha service to pay W2 workers with Bitcoin after calculating and withholding taxes elsewhere, alleviating the income tax duties for employees.  If you sell or transact with your bitcoins after they have changed in value, you will also have to take capital gains tax into consideration (cost-basis information will be easily accessible through our portal). We recommend that you consult a tax professional regarding your Bitcoin capital gains tax questions. There are tax services, for example [LibraTax] ( to help calculate the capital gain change for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:11:00
If you want, you could dedicate as little as 1% and as high as 100% of your paycheck directly to bitcoin.
Since we are providing a service to the employer, most, if not all, the costs will be for the employer.  This means that employees getting Bitcoin wages will receive cheaper Bitcoins.
Bitcoin Payroll is similar to Direct Deposit.  Before we received a check in the mail and then would have to go to a bank and deposit the check.  With Bitcoin,  you have to set up a bank account, link it to a Bitcoin provider and then wait several days for the Bitcoins to come through every time you order.  With Bitcoin Payroll, you set up your account one time and receive Bitcoins on every pay day.  Fast, simple, easy.
Did I mention you no longer need to have a bank account if you do not want to?
I hope that answers your question

We are registered in the State of California and will therefore be regulated within the United States under FinCEN and other regulatory regimes, such as the SEC and the CFTC, once regulatory clarity is provided.
Right now we are purely transactional, we are not holding any Bitcoins at all for customers, we are not providing a wallet.  If the exchange went down, we would just buy from a different one.  
We will tell you the time we are purchasing Bitcoins and the exchange from which, so you will be able to compare the price on our site with the historical prices of the exchange used at the time.  In the future, we plan to allow choices for time of purchase and exchange.  
We hope to earn your trust.
We plan to do an AMA on from 9am until noon PST on May 20th.

Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here.  When you sign up, we provide you with a direct deposit account which you can provide to your employer.  Most US payroll systems allow you to split your payroll between two different accounts, in this case your fiat and your crypto account.  Once the funds hit the account, you get bitcoin directly into your wallet same or next day.
-Deliver funds same to next day, faster than coinbase/cash ach services, cheaper than credit card instant purchases.
-Sends funds directly to your wallet.  Coinbase and cash app want you to hold the crypto on their services.  We encourage users to be their own bank.  Can pay out to a single wallet, a list of wallet addresses, or even through an uploaded XPubKey.
-No bank account needed.  Funds won't flow through your own bank account.  Reduces risk of bank account closer on your main checking account due to "suspicious activity" and even allows you to live off the banking system if you like.

Will will be able to process small amounts!  For now, our service has no fees while in Beta.  We can actually currently do this use case for freelancers outside of the us.  Direct to local currency in the Philippines and Brazil or through our debit card option in over 170 different countries (India and US being the two major countries we cannot send cards to).
Our fees will be a flat rate per receiver.  We are also looking into a license model if you are paying many people over the course of the month.  Regardless of the system, it will be extremely competitive with other options when you include speed and forex bonus!
Let me know if you have any other questions and please feel free to email me at Jonathan :)

Hi, it's Bitwage here. With our service, you don't even need to ask your employer to get paid in Bitcoin. You simply sign up with Bitwage, we generate a unique bank account for you, your employer pays your salary in fiat into that bank account and we handle the rest - you get your salary in Bitcoin. (or a part of it).
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:53:24
Yup, we can tell :) We just wanted to point out that employer doesn't have to be involved!

You do not need to have 100% of your wage in BTC, you can choose to get 50% of your wages in USD and 50% in BTC, for example.  That way, you can HODL your BTC and not deal with capital gains when paying for expenses in USD.

Example: Employee would want to be fully paid in Bitcoin if there is a problem with fiat transfers to his country and he is a remote worker. 
Otherwise it makes sense to receive eg. 60-80% of your salary in fiat and 20-40% in crypto. Bitwage can actually automate the entire process so you don't have to worry about exchange every month.

Try refreshing your Cache, you seem to be looking at an old website, as pricing has changed.  A key benefit is that you maintain control of your keys, instead of handing them over to a third party service.  
0% fees seems a little low to me for an exchange, but could be wrong.

Hi, Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here.  We just launched a service for companies with Bitcoin that have banking issues.  Now companies can actually pay their payroll tax obligations and hire employees as W2 employees (this means benefits!) with their Bitcoin holdings :)  
This creates a closed loop, which means employees can get paid in Bitcoin and employers can pay in Bitcoin.  
Can learn more about it here: [

If you have direct deposit with your employer you can usually split your payroll so only a percentage goes through bitwage into bitcoin and the other part can go through traditional systems toward gas, etc.
@_date: 2015-11-10 00:49:55
Jonathan from Bitwage here.  Every state (as well as some counties and cities) have different rules when it comes to payroll taxes, so it is smart to consult an accounting professional.  However, there are two rules that you must abide by in all of the states, **1) You must pay your payroll taxes and 2) If you price the wages in Bitcoin, you must make sure that this does not go below minimum wage in terms of dollars at any point**.
Also, if you are purchasing the bitcoin yourself, you also have to think about accruing **capital gains** between when you buy the bitcoins and when you send them to employees.
Some of the advantages of using our system include: 
**No Capital Gains headache**:  Because you never touch bitcoin directly, you don't have to worry about any costs or accounting issues that come about with dealing with capital gains + payroll taxes
**Zero-Click payrolls**:  The payroll admin sets up the payrolls one time, and never have to deal with it again.  Afterwards, it is 100% employee driven.
**Next Day**:  Employees receive their bitcoins the day after direct deposits (instead of 4 days).
**Low Costs**:  We have no fees currently, which makes us cheaper than alternative methods.  Our exchange rate may be slightly higher than the average, but less than 1% higher.
Please feel free to email directly at Jonathan if you have any other questions :)

Xapo is the only wallet with a US presence that has a low cost, highly scalable debit card program. We plan to work together with Xapo to provide transparency throughout the entire program. Xapo is a highly qualified team, though they have strong compliance controls, we're working together closely to make sure the debit card program works as smoothly as possible. Ultimately, the goal is to bring the efficiencies of bitcoin mainstream, so workers internationally can receive their funds better than through the traditional systems.

Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here.  We allow anyone to receive any percentage of their wage in bitcoin without their employer signing up from US, EU and UK companies.  We do this by providing collections accounts to users that act as a direct deposit for your bitcoin wallet.  This means that you are able to receive Bitcoin without needing to use your bank account, thus eliminating this risk completely.  It's also the easiest way to dollar cost average your reserves of Bitcoin.

There are currently no fees while we are in Beta.  We will likely be charging flat fees per payroll once we exit Beta.  Employers: $5 per payroll + $1 per employee (discounts for larger numbers of employees).  Individuals without Employers signed up: $2 per payroll.
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:35:21
Most people set the percentage at the employer level.  The main reason for this is because if it was done at our level, it would delay the dollar funds by 2 to 4 days.  However, we now offer a cloud savings solution that allows you to split between dollars and bitcoin on our system.  If you have a non-us address, you can spend those dollars on a debit card.  Otherwise, you can withdraw the dollars to your bank account through our cloud savings partner.

We ask for very limited information as your employer or client has likely already vetted you as an employee or a contractor and done their own due diligence (in addition with sending forms to both the state and federal agencies).  However, in the case of international employees signing up without their employers on our system, we typically ask for ID and proof of address.  This is done because of the higher risk of fraud associated with international payments.
We are dedicated to privacy, however, we do not want to help those looking to use our service to launder stolen funds.

Jonathan from [Bitwage]( here.  In case you did not know, we allow anyone, regardless of their employer signing up, to receive any percentage of their wages in bitcoin.  
In addition, we have a lot of features to use on top of our platform.  For instance, you can split up your wages on our platform to receive 50% bitcoin and 50% gold, or if you have a non-US address, you can get paid directly into a bitcoin debit card.  We also have some enhanced logging in and privacy features which we have soft launched (so if you play around the website, you might find a few goodies).
Just to touch on beta and fees.  We have decided internally that we will not be charging fees for our pure Bitcoin Payroll for the Individual service once we exit beta, however, we will be charging for additional features.  
We have some very exciting announcements coming up soon, so please stay tuned.

The main reasons why users like to use Bitwage is the following:
-Speed: We deliver funds same-next day
-Limits:  There are no limits to our platform, can do $100 or $100,000
-Control:  All the funds are sent directly to any wallet of your choosing.  This means you have control of your own funds and do not have to worry about the risk of a third party being hacked.
-Security:  We have an iOS &amp; android app that allow you to use an in-house authenticator and turn off sms to protect against the SMS porting hack in an easy way.
Capabilities:  We have unique EU euro accounts, local US &amp; UK accounts and the ability to receive funds in CAD, JPY, AUD, CHF.
-Unbanked:  You no longer need a bank account when using bitwage.  This is great for people who want to get into bitcoin but are unbanked or for people.  For people who are international contractors and want to receive bitcoin at US or EU prices, this is the only way to do this.
Also, this means that you don't have a risk of your bank account being closed down because they do not like that you did a bitcoin transaction.  Here's a recent case:
