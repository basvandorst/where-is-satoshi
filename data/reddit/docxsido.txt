and in blockchain it's saying the watch only address is not backed up by your pass phrase , transfer it to a wallet to secure funds

and those 12 words are my wallet pass phrase , the watch only address was generated in another wallet , so how is it possible to get the private key out of the 12 words ?? i mean that watch only address wasn't generated on blockchain ( my wallet ) i think

i managed to recover it bro , but bitcoin core is saying the file is corrupted , is there a way to fix it ?
