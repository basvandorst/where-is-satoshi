I had also tried Bitcoin core but I thought mSigna had a modern and easier UI. Also I thought I wouldn't​ need to download the whole blockchain on to my PC if I use mSigna instead of Bitcoin core. Was I wrong?
How do I ensure the BTC were transferred by connected the PC wallet to some blockchain node? If someone can help me with the connect part and tell me how to connect mSigna to the live blockchain then I can try to verify it. Also did I need to be connected when I generated the address?

You should visit bitcoin.org and learn how Bitcoin works to answer your own questions lol
But yeah I am thinking miners have too much power like banks do. I am also still learning.

I was able to transfer $85 in bitcoins for $2.5 worth paid in fees. Did I still pay too much?
