You're on the right track. Bitcoin, just like any other good technology, needs the early adopters to use multi level marketing tactics to gain traction.

As others have pointed out your guide is massively insecure. If someone is INVESTING in Bitcoin, meaning a considerable amount, there is a pretty easy and straight forward process to store them :
**WHAT THIS GUIDE WILL DO**
Create a M-of-N Shamirs Sharing Secret address to which you will send the coins you want to store. Store the private keys on printed paper and on USB sticks, ready to be distributed to people you trust, bank deposit boxes or something similar.
This is done through an offline Linux invironment, using well known open source software to generate the private keys.
**WHAT YOU NEED**
* Bitcoins ready to send to the cold storage address. This could be on an exchange (i.e. Bitstamp), in a hot wallet (i.e. Blockchain) or elsewhere.
* A(n old) computer. For maximum security (paranoia) a computer that has never been connected to the internet.
* An online computer.
* Three or four USB sticks. Brand new or formatted.
* A printer that can connect to the computer by cable.
**STEP BY STEP GUIDE**
ON YOUR ONLINE COMPUTER
1\. Download Linux Mint .iso file by going to [this webpage]( and click on a proxy near you. (Please note, if your offline computer is a 32bit system, you need to go [here]( instead)
2\. Download Universal USB Installer by clicking [this link](
3\. Insert a USB stick in your computer and run the program Universal USB Installer. Select Linux Mint, the iso file you downloaded in 1. and the flash drive in each of the drop down menus.
ON YOUR OFFLINE (OLD) OFFLINE COMPUTER
4\. Get into the bios. If possible, disable all wifi. Set boot priority to USB before disk storage.
5\. Insert the USB stick you made in 3 and boot the machine in Linux Mint.
6\. On the desktop is a file that reads "Install Linux Mint". Double click. Choose to erase the disk and install Linux Mint. When prompted, select the "Overwrite free disk space" option. (Can't remember if that's the exact wording).
7\. Pull out the USB and reboot in Linux Mint from the Hard Drive.
ON YOUR ONLINE COMPUTER
8\. Insert the USB stick and format it.
9\. Download  by clicking [this link](
10\. Extract the folder and copy it to the USB stick.
ON YOUR OFFLINE (OLD) OFFLINE COMPUTER
11\. Insert the USB stick and run the file *bitaddress.org.html*
12\. Move the mouse around until you see the menu tabs. Go to the *Split Wallet* tab
13\. Select the number of shares you want to distribute and the amount of keys needed to re-create the private key. I did 4 and 2 - that way I hold two shares in separate locations and gave the last two to different family members.
14\. Shrink the Firefox window so only share1 is visible. Hit Alt + Print Screen and save the screendump to the desktop.
15\. Repeat this for the other shares as well as the address.
16\. Connect the printer to the computer and install it though the Start -&amp;gt; Printers menu (works 99% as in Windows).
17\. Print each screendump to seperate peaces of paper.
18\. Insert **a new** USB stick and copy the *bitaddress.org-master* folder and the share1 screendump to the USB stick.
19\. Do the same for the amount of shares you have on separate USB sticks.
20\. Laminate the shit out of each paper.
21\. Insert the USB stick you made in step 3. and boot the computer.
22\. Repeat step 6. This will format the offline computer once again removing the information of all the shares.
23\. Now you have a set of each share comtaining a paper print and an image on a USB stick. Distribute the set of shares in various locations that you can trust.
24\. Send your bitcoins to the Address the way you prefer. From an exchange, a hot wallet or something else.
**WHEN YOU NEED THE COINS AGAIN**
When you need the funds, simply go to the "Split Wallet" tab on bitaddress.org **on your offline computer** and insert the shares in the bottom white space separated and generate the private key. This can then be used to sweep or import to your preferred bitcoin wallet service in the future.

Just for a second pretend that this device prints Dollars instead of mining Bitcoins. How much would you sell a device that prints money ? more or less than the amount of money that it will generate over its life span ?  Here is a simple calculation :
* Expected amount of profit from the device  = A
* Cost of the device itself = B
* Shipping = C
* Profit margin = D
* Price for the device = A(present value) + B + C + D
If the price they sell it to you is any less than that they're not good at running a business. Most of the time they know what they're doing. Contact Butterfly Labs for more info.

So you pay Coinbase $100, then they charge you 1% to let you spend that $100. (Via bitcoins you never really owned)
Let's see after sending your $$ to a third party, you:
* Let a 3rd party manage your money.
* Pay a 1% fee to this third party. 
* Can only buy things that are already legal. (Coinbase doesn't facilitate illegal transactions)
* Have to provided proof of [your identity]( to Coinbase.
* Do all this for tax compliance. 
* By using this method you opts out of consumer protection.
Or you can just use PayPal or CC or as I'd like to say it **PayPal and CC users not affected"**.

Grow up dude. About time you take responsibility for your actions, whether it's selling explosives without a licence and endangering other people's lives, renouncing your citizenship and evading your taxes or telling people that [Gox has all the money and the traditional banking is to blame]( 
You fucked up in every single one of these instances, no the fed is not after you, and you're not a victim. You're just a fucking man child with the most naive world view who happens to have found an eager audience in the Bitcoin community. If you're shocked by the the number of people who find no sympathy for you outside of your little butt bubble then welcome to the real world.

fair enough, that justifies holding $50 in Bitcoin as a means to use the funbux.
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:17:40
Here is a simple explanation :
A = # of people who own Bitcoin because they find it useful and use it.
B = # of people who own Bitcoin because they think the price is going to the moon as a result of the massive demand for Bitcoin by group A.
Group B is astronomically larger than group A.
Therefor **SELL ALL NOW**.

This sucks, don't listen to idiots or scumbag pumpers who say you should buy more BTC since CHEAP COINZ. 
* Talk to the police, file a report.
* Check your local craigslist or similar websites to see if anything shows up there.
* Check all the software and webapps that auto login to see if there is a new location that logged into your account.
Shit happens, specially with Bitcoin since it asks the user to take on the monumental task of being their own bank, don't blame yourself. Many people here on have lost their hard earned money one way or another. Just see how many times this phrase keep getting repeated ["sorry for your loss"]( .Money comes and goes, fuck it you'll make that money back soon enough.

I seriously don't understand why anyone takes Andreas and and his outrageous ideas that are related to the field geopolitics and economics seriously. He is a no name security "expert" who's only claim to fame is talking about Bitcoin. Great guy but just because you find his ideas about crypto currencies credible don't apply the same level of credibility to his other ideas. 
He is blinded by his ideology. He is an anarcho capitalist, sees state as the ultimate evil. In his mind the only reason wars exist is that FED runs the monetary system, think Bitcoin is going to massively limit states power, as a result of this wars will end. He starts with the conclusion and builds the reasoning from around it.
If he ever wanted to seriously examine if crypto can ever end wars, he should first fully understand what war is(that's a pretty difficult topic by itself), how they get started, and how the fuck that relates to cryptos. But he has no interest in any of that, he already "knows" the conclusion. FED is the source of all evil, Bitcoin will end that and then anything bad will go away and good stuff will happen. 
Now all I said would be an ad hominem (he can be naive and stupid and still be correct about his conclusions), but he doesn't really provide reasoning or detailed rational for his "arguments" for me argue against. 
To think that war, something that has happened ever since the dawn of civilization and happens due to multitude of reasons and some times no good reasons at all, is going to end because we use blockchain is ludicrous. You're smart enough to understand that, and I'm sure he is too.
tl;dr Reality is much more complicated to be explained by his piss poor bumper sticker logic.
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:43:11
How does bitcoin end the state's ability to print money ??? And oh and people don't like higher taxes so they don't pay them ?? Just saying stuff doesn't mean it will actually happen buddy

Cool story bro, now can you formulate a serious argument you know with facts and stuff. Shit has happened in history so it will happen again but this time with Bitcoin ! is not a credible argument.
From your link


Awesome, now there are a TON of horrible currencies, in which country has anything that with the largest stretch of imagination possible could be called Hyperbitcoinization has happened, or even gaining momentum ? 
Name one.
In the real world, people in countries with shit currency mainly switch to US dollars.
