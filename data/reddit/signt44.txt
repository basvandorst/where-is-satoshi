I have family members that made a killing in real estate, in Florida and places down south. The trend seems to be people from the North East are heading down there as its ridiculously expensive to live up here, espically on the Island. But that's awesome, good for you i hope you do well !

I was going to treat it like the stock market i like to think im good at working the stock market i made a lot of money. It did involve a lot of following of trends like with nintendoni made 9 grand on a 500ndollar investment. I also worked in a boiler room before my morality hit me so i kinda have a grasp (id like to think) on followfollowingong trends and such. I heard and from what i see this can be a good money maker but at the same time it seems a hell of a lot less stable then what pops off in times square. Bit coin seems really hsrd to predict price fluctuation. But i really don't know lol. Thats why i wans learn bitcoin

I live in the states, i agree with all that you said. This may be my homeland and all but its a shame I'm almost ashamed to live here mostly because of the way everyone else views this country (its the Government not the people except a certain percentage). I dont agree with its government in any way, its a mess. I'm sorry for any crap anyone gets in any shape or form from the out "Government" which is seeming more and more like a business everyday espically with this whole thing.

lucky, i think im going to stay away from bit coin for a while, give it a few years, and see how it develops further. Thank you for all the help man, you're a good dude. I appreciate it.

you just answered a question i was going to ask you. Sorry to be a pain with the questions lol. I was going to ask if its normal for the sites ive been trying to use to ask for a photo id and a picture of my face next to it or holding it. Thanks again i was worried that was some scam or something.

cool that's actually really good to hear. All the stupid little things im learning are actually very good points i feel like i should know, its just hard for me to find information or understand information im finding on certain things. Im going to wait for coinbase to be back, and use that cause from what you just told me it seems to be more professionally run.
