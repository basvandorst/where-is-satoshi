Congratulations. It's a lovely car.  Delighted to see your Bitcoin is working for you. Even if there are people saying it's not working. I'm glad to see it is for some of us. Well done. Hopefully, it will get better and better.

You mean, he won't have to exchange his Bitcoins for millions of dollars because it will be THE currency. Yes, that's the idea. I love this.  There are a lot of people saying Bitcoin will never replace 'real' money. But Bitcoin is real money. Many people have trouble adjusting to new concepts at first. They need some time to adjust.  Bitcoin is the currency of the future while traditional currency is the currency of the past.

Oh, that's sad. Perhaps the recent fluctuations put them off. But I am sure that this is temporary. The only way for Bitcoin is to go forward. I'm sure they'll feel the loss of custom after a while. Just think that it's only a temporary setback. Peaks and valleys are a feature of most currencies, so we should be optimistic.

A couple of kids being jealous of each other because one is pretending to have two Bitcoins? Well, that's somewhat futuristic, but I'm sure it will all come true in time. And Bitcoins will be so valuable, obviously, that there will be terrible jealousy. Well, let's hope so!

Countries banning Bitcoin? What are they afraid of? It only goes to show how powerful the currency is. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in particular, are the future.

Is this why some countries are banning Bitcoin? Because as some bankers are warning, it could bring the Internet to a halt? That's the extent of its influence.
