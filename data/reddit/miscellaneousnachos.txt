I regret selling. I never bought in again.

Agreed. The impact of U.S. inflation is bidding up all sorts of asset classes. This post is targeted at the Peter Schiffs of the world. (BITCOIN IS A BUBBLE, STICK WITH TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS)

Just sold quite a bit.

This would be ideal. However, it's not accepting the seed anymore.

So I tried on a fresh install on a different computer and it still did not work. To clarify, I have already restored the wallet once. I was told to restore it as a two factor auth wallet and it would remove that, which it did. Not sure how that impacts trying to restore the private seed a second time.

The drive would first have to be decrypted to perform an export.

Literally, any nachos will do. However, if I had to choose, chicken nachos are the way to go.

I first heard about it from classmates and did my own research on it from there. I liked the concept of it being decentralized and saw investment potential in it as a hedge against inflation. The majority of the Bitcoin that has come to me actually has not been through buying. Instead I mined alt coins and converted to BTC.

Some nights I take melatonin. Last night I took melatonin.

The transaction has finally been confirmed. Thank you for all of the suggestions.

I could send you my private key! However, I am choosing not to.

Just saw the memo, dumping everything now.

They are deposited into an account and I have the private keys on an encrypted drive.

I do not run Core. I currently don't have enough hard drive space on my SSD to accommodate the current blockchain size. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:50:34
I was not planning on doing so. However, I can.

Where -- I first learned of Bitcoin from classmates in school.   
When -- I became interested in Bitcoin back when there were no real reputable exchanges and the only way to buy it was to send money to Dwolla and then to Mt. Gox. You know the rest.   
How -- I liked the decentralized concept and calculated increase in supply. There also seemed to be investment potential. In 2011 there was a significant amount of price increase in commodities and gloom/doom talk. Bitcoin seemed like a hedge.

Hypothetically, it would be turquoise.

I have since found another exchange. Near instant deposits. FREAKING CRAZY CONCEPT I KNOW.

A friend recently asked me to borrow some cash, so I made a loan to him. He is now nearly a month late on when he said he'd pay me back. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:40:27
No no no, good for *yooou* fam. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:10:26
edit: However, I did sell quite a bit more near the recent peak. Currently watching charts for another potential entry.

$10,000. Buy high, sell low.

I purchase small luxuries from time to time and don't contribute as much as I should towards long term investments.
