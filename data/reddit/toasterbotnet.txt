I wonder how this works ...
I mean you can see the coins spreading out to different addresses,
but no matter what, you can see where the money goes.
I imagine you could just write simple scripts to check and follow the flow of the money.
So what exactyl is the endgoal here ?
If he uses these coins anywhere or moves them to an exchange he's busted, isn't he ?
I always wondered how these hackers and criminals actually make their money untraceable.
Are there any exchanges, which don't require an ID or something ?

This looks simple and clean. Exactly what I was looking for. awesome, thanks.
bought the pro version right away.
Do you only support the top coins ? If not, maybe think about adding Gridcoin. That would be cool :)

You can do that for small amounts, I get that. But there's only so much you can sell to someone or buy stuff .... What the hell do you do with 60 Million Dollars ?

Either we are all ahead of our time or we are all a bunch of delusional crazy people.

There's a big difference between understanding the potential and betting everything on one horse.
Diversfying a bit would be safer. This is all still just a giant experiment. Putting everything in crypto is a dangerous gamble.
Be careful and stay safe.

That's exactly the theory. In such a case very few people would sell, which would lead to a price explosion.
Fiat would become worthless and Bitcoin would be replacing it. If you buy stuff people would want to be paid with bitcoin in this hypothetical universe.
I don't believe this and this will never ever happen, but I think that's how the argument goes :)
