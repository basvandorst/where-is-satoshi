Nobody expected this. Almost everyone with half a brain expected high volatility in line with the ridiculously high uncertainty about bitcoin’s future.

You are correct, but this guy seemed hellbent on losing it all. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:24:31
But it's not so simple. They were going to have to repay the users for the loss, so in a sense it was their money.
Edit: If said white hat hadn't returned the bitcoin, blockchain.info would have been out that amount of bitcoin because of the decision they made to repay the losses.

It kind of reads like a publicity stunt. Like someone thought, hmm...what would be the best way to make an emotional appeal to the bitcoin crowd?

It's always entertaining when people on inadvertently argue against using it. Like the (heavily upvoted) guy on the "coinbase introduces dollar wallets" thread that asked if he could now use coinbase to pay for things in bitcoin without actually having to buy bitcoin.

OK...but are they lying about the performance of the gear? If not, I don't see why it's fraud. They're just giving people the right to make a stupid investment.

All I'm saying is if you see ridiculously high deposit bonuses that seem too good to be true, then you should be suspicious. I'm not saying he didn't get screwed, I'm just saying that some warning signs were there. 
I assume the reason he chose to bet there was he realized it would be hard to lose with such ridiculously high deposit bonuses. Of course they kept changing to rollover rules; at their originally stated rules, they would lose a ton of money. If you look at that and realize it, then hopefully you think to yourself "that's too good to be true."

I wouldn't blame it on Bitstamp necessarily. Imagine that you and everyone else has a stop loss to sell right under 200. But who is buying right under 200? It would be stupid to buy right after such important support is broken. So the price is going to plummet until you get to a level where there are enough buyers to satisfy the selling from all the stop losses. 
I'm not saying Bitstamp's trading engine is perfect (I have no idea), but you should be aware of the risks of placing stops at such levels. You are not only trusting in Bitstamp's stop loss function, but you are trusting that there will be people to buy your coins at the very level where everyone is going to be selling and nobody is going to be buying.
