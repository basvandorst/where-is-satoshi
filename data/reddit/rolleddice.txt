Sorry hadn't seen it posted on this sub yet.

It's still not a bad thing. If struggling companies are willing to take a risk on adopting Bitcoin, successful companies such as Amazon can monitor the benefit.  If Bitcoin improves the bottom line for companies like Overstock, I am sure others will follow suit once they see the benefits. I see this as positive news.

Same, I got a championship t-shirt the other day. Go Hawks!

Problem is credit union ATMs aren't always widely available.

Yes good point, I guess people will sell and take profits. I'm sure many people who bought at $6 would've have taken profits by this point. Just like those who are buying in now would surely cash some out if Bitcoins hit something "ridiculous" like $10k.

Great video, his point is what I'm trying to bring up.

Just to clarify, I probably shouldn't have used the word "unfair," but instead "flawed" or "problematic."
pointed out that we have no one to blame but ourselves for not adopting early, and I agree with him. However, I know some people will think that they missed the boat on Bitcoin, and claim they got screwed. My instincts tell me those people will do anything in their power to try and undermine the Bitcoin economy. If they succeed or not is another question. This is my concern.

Absolutely, definitely not one of those "woe is me" posts. I admit I was late to the game, and I'm happy to know about it now. But to play Devil's Advocate, there will be people who think they got screwed, and will do anything in their power to try and undermine the system. If they succeed or not is another question.

Relevant in terms of current distribution:

Won't this just mean that people will be incentivized to create new currency schemes, with the hopes that it will be better and thus the creator will get rich?

I'm not saying the system right now is ideal. Just trying to see if there is a chink in the armor for Bitcoin that could potentially lead to it's downfall. I wanted to see what everyone else thought.

OK maybe I shouldn't have used the word "unfair,"  that's creating a lot of philosophical comments. I was trying to imply flawed, as in, it benefits all of us just for being at the right place at the right time, for almost doing nothing. I have bought Bitcoins and I believe in the value. There's no such thing as easy money, so I'm trying to see what the loopholes are.
