Much appreciated! ����
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:27:54
I built a specific chat room in the app for that called "App Talkbox", or you can just email me directly through the "Contact Us" button in the "More" tab.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:09:58
Thank you! Wish I had time to add some sort of OCR scanning for import, but I think some apps allow csv export and in that case I definitely have several import options in the work (csv, api key, etc)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:25:02
Thanks, lmk your thoughts! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:45:48
No worries, appreciate your opinion. Like most things, this app is not for everyone :) 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:21:25
Yes! Here is the direct link 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:50:35
It originally started as just a simple portfolio tracking app that had stocks &amp; cryptos! Just kept on working on it and adding stuff to finally get it to where it is today
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:27:16
Thanks, a long way to go but I think its a good start =)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:01:18
I did too, that's why I created it! :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:45:03
Thank you and appreciate your support!
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:49:26
Thank you - its definitely not easy but its worth it when you know you're doing what you love, and with time good things will come. I always try to stay optimistic 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:34:43
Appreciate it so much, really have a big vision for it and this type of feedback keeps me working hard! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:00:54
Thanks let me know what you think!
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:55:29
Absolutely, thats something that I know is important - I'm currently using an API aggregator which uses certain exchanges but am working on moving away from them and hooking up directly to the exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:49:37
Thank god for fiverr.com :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:34:22
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:14:28
Agreed, a website is in development - I just come from a mobile development background so when I started working on this, it was the my goto. As I started introducing the forum, I realized that a web-app is a MUST since nobody likes reading and typing long messages on a phone :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:42:42
hehe thanks :) Definitely helped build a few other apps in the past for me
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:19:25


just me and my own two-hands (which literally hurt from programming so much)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:47:24
Thanks for the kind words of encouragement, you rock! :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:32:41
Blockfolio is a portfolio tracker, but I envision Cryptonomy to be something much more - a complete community ecosystem for crypto enthusiasts. Some of the key differences are:
• Real-time stackoverflow style forum, with user profiles
• Live chat channels for central topics (adding personal messaging soon)
• News aggregation with ability to jump directly to coin, plus coin-specific news
• ICO Listings
• Ability to see side-by-side comparisons of coins graphs
• You can also add conventional stocks (FB, AAPL, GOOGL, etc) if you don't want to switch between portfolio apps
As i'm continuing to develop Cryptonomy, the focus will be the community, while still improving the portfolio and all of its features (API sync, buy/sell, etc). 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:01:04
Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:30:18
You change your "default currency" in the "More" tab to ETH, BTC, w/e you'd like (i'm working on adding trading pairs right now)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:53:23
Awesome! Feel free to send over any feedback you have 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:39:32
100% agree,and that's actually not the main focus of Cryptonomy. While portfolio-tracking is a key functionality, the greater value is of the community features in the app - the forum and chat, which will soon be joined by a few more community-oriented features. Check it out and you'll see for yourself :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:06:40
I like that idea a lot - and its pretty simple to integrate since I can just calculate the % into a currency amount. Adding it to my to-do list and look out for it to be available soon :) 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:12:00
There are similarities, but also a lot of differences. Reddit has no review system, no developed discovery section, historical/financial information, etc. 
This is only the beginning, and I'm focused on building something strictly for crypto-enthusiasts and the crypto vertical, so you'll see Cryptonomy even further developing into its own, unique, platform.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:24:31
it should redirect... if not, here is the direct link
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:42:34
After being interested and involved in the crypto for a while, I decided to quit my job, take a leap of faith,  and focus my time and energy on building an application that would become a unified eco-system, a friendly hub of sorts, for everything crypto - and that's how Cryptonomy was born!
This app has become a place where you can track, discuss and learn everything you need about crypto. 
It has all the foundational features of a portfolio tracker but on steroids... 
- A news aggregator with trending articles from all over the web (and an option to see news per specific coin), so that you are always stay in the loop.
-  Chat rooms to discuss leading topics with other users.
- A filterable and sortable ICO's listing, with the ability to up-vote, down-vote and discuss each ICO.
- An "Academy" section with a 7-day crypto course for beginners, as well as an FAQ and a knowledge base.
- Grid and List view different viewing options.
- Ability to add/search conventional stocks (so you don't have to switch between other portfolio tracking apps).
I built the product from scratch (iOS + Android), and have started development on the web-app as well. I'm looking to add wallet integration as well and ICO brokerage directly into to the platform, to fix the current ICO process which is deeply broken in my mind.
I'd be grateful if you download it (don't think you'll be disappointed), share, rate, and of course leave any feedback that you have, in order to improve the app and help others enter the crypto world. 
iOS: 
Android: 
If you, or anyone you know, is interested in asking/talking more about 
the app, feel free to send me a private message!
Have a great day and HODLLLL ����
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:29:04
no not open source yet, but i definitely have plans of opening up certain parts of it. 
Blockfolio is very portfolio centric - and I found it to be too complex for many users who don't have any experience with trading or crypto. Cryptonomy also has stock information so you don't have to switch apps if you have a combined portfolio. I am also pushing community-focused features and will be launching a forum within the app, something stackoverflow style. But the main difference is that Cryptonomy is focused on community, sharing of ideas, promoting discussions and providing reliable and accessible information, my goal is to make it the "main authority" in the crypto world, not a portfolio app.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:23:54
just posted! (see my comment)
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:34:10
That's really weird..what iOS are you on?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:41:54
If you'd like to help me on the project, dm me and we can discuss more! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:07:29
Honestly, there is nothing I get more joy in than building things - this is probably the 40th product I've built and the excitement is still the same as the first one. Do you develop as well? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:55:22
So great to hear that! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:20:51
Haven't been for 12 years ;)
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:49:22
Absolutely - but what are some ways for me to provide you assurances it is secure?
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:01:09
That’s not true.. it’s absolutely free. Where does it  say it costs anything?
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:32:42
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:16:37
I actually saw what the 16 y/o did, and while impressive its definitely not "the same thing". A quick glance at the the video/app store listing/app itself would make your realize that
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:49:34
Thanks for the kind words ����
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:54:59
Thank you - and a lot more stuff on the way ����
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:29:19
Total holding value will replace the "avg. buy price" currently there. And sales are in development too, definitely need those in there! Also, "optional" purchase price as well, so you've actually covered some of the things i'm working on right now. Look out for an update to have those all taken care of! :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:33:56
iOS - swift, Android - Java, backend - Firebase &amp; JS
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:39:34
No not including dependencies - around 50k a platform! Obviously a lot of LOC aren't usually good, but there was a lot of work on building the different components of logic, model, UI, etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:53:27
Thanks, I'll be patiently waiting ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:19:52
It's not open source atm, but considering it - and I can assure you all data is stored locally for now. I am working on cross-device portfolio sync, but will encrypt all information once that happens. I also think the reviews themselves can assure you pretty well that this app is secure! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:21:41
It's really easy to say something is similar if you don't bother to take 30 seconds to look into it, but take 15 seconds to write two bashful comments. All good though :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:31:59
Love to hear that, feel the same :) So you're a mobile dev?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:35:46
When you're long pressing on the graph and moving your finger? Perhaps I'll lower the haptic feedback a bit, it does feel like a playstation-controller hehe
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:23:03
So happy to hear - And yes, more extensive exchange integration (as well as wallet API sync is on my more immediate roadmap)
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:57:50
I definitely admire what Blockfolio and Delta are doing, but think a designated community ecosystem for crypto is what's really missing, and working hard to start something big ����. 
Thank you so much for the gold! I've always wondered if and when my day would come - I guess it's today :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:23:18
Its currently all stored locally, but I'm working on cross-device syncing so that all you'll need to do is login with your account and vwallah, you're portfolio will be restored (all encrypted too!)
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:34:37
Wow, that really makes me so glad to hear. There are so many portfolio apps out there and I just wanted to make something that was about the community aspect, yet offered the base functionality of tracking. So its really nice to see comments like this that re-assure me I'm working on something important! 
I added some donation addresses on the website,  Thank you so much stranger! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:14:17
Thanks! What do you mean by nicer app button? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:14:35
Appreciate it, and be my guest! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:34:44
This is my full-time job now, but thanks :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:34:15
Don't really know what that is buy imagine its related to security - I can assure you everything you have in the app is safe and protected. If you don't trust me, look at the reviews on the apps stores! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:39:52
Thanks so much :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:16:29
I feel you - I added a "skip" button on Android (iOS will have it on the next version). I can promise you though you'll never see those pop-ups again 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:07:31
Yes it does! Check out the "price alerts" (alert button in the top right part of the screen when you're looking at a specific coin's info)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:34:17
I had a bit of money saved-up, as well as did a bit of freelancing on the side after I quit my job (did iOS development). For now hoping to close a fundraise and really turn Cryptonomy into the biggest ecosystem for crypto-enthusiasts - if i succeed, not really worried at where the salary will come from! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:03:13
In addition to my word, I think the reviews and the feedback on the app-stores should give you enough confidence there are absolutely 0 things malicious in it! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:05:43
Yeah haha! Literally been my life this last half year, computer by my side all day, no matter where I was - many 18+ hour days of coding, but could say i've never enjoyed "working" on something more
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:25:42
Thanks for the awesome feedback! 
Regarding the issue, need to check that - are you on iOS or Android?
About the feature request, I agree - that's really useful and i'm working on revamping the whole "holdings" screen, which will include buy &amp; sell, trading pairs, exchange pairs, and perhaps I'll be able to fit that in as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:43:43
Saw you post in the "App Talkbox", once they add an "export to csv" or something like that, I'll do it :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:26:53
Where I come from, MVP means minimum viable product ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:48:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:18:46
Fiverr! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:23:31
Agreed, a lot of people mentioned that and its in the works!
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:50:15
Appreciate it =)
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:06:56
When you build a lot of stuff and don't really have any money to pay anyone, you find amazing services like fiverr.com which get the job done at the fraction of the price - that's where i got the video done (cost me $60 :))
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:19:04
Here you go: 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:19:18
Which device are you running on?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:45:05
Do you mean gridlines, or just getting the value of a specific point on the graph?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:23:19
Absolutely - using them as inspiration wherever I can!  
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:47:08
Thanks, taken :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:27:22
You can change your "default currency" in the "More" tab, but I'm working on adding "Trading pairs" which should solve this problem, as well as ability to input "Sells"
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:04:29
No luck, maybe its something the video studio/dude made themselves hehe
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:03:34
Not even sure, I got the video made from some one on fiverr, let me check though
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:46:55
100% i added that, but only within a "specific topic" (Which you can access by tapping on the "topic title" under the content itself)
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:43:08
Thanks fam :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:24:28
Have always wanted to add light mode, just haven't had the time yet. And about 0 purchase price, you can do it on Android (iOS will have it next version). Look out for the updates!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:23:47
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:24:27
Agree with all of what you said 100% - working on pretty much covering most of those (at this very moment), so an update will be released soon with these fixed/added! Thanks for the feedback :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:58:41
Gradually adding more supported exchanges so definitely will be available soon!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:47:35
You can do that - just tap on the "change labels" to toggle percentage / $ changes
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:05
Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:46:32
If you want to support with a one-time-purchase, I can do that for you! PMed
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:37:06
Access what specifically? This is the website for the app -  and a web-app is in development!
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:23:36
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:19:36
This should be fixed now! Moved over to CMC for REQ, even though prices are much lower now ;)
