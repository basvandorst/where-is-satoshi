Despite the similarities seen across Bitcoin’s previous halvings, a study found that its price is unimpacted by block rewards reduction events. The research conducted by Nico Cordeiro and Ava Masucci from Strix Leviathan, a Seattle-based startup that specializes in engineering and operating trading algorithms for crypto, analyzed 32 halvings across 24 cryptocurrencies and compared these to an overall market benchmark.
In summation, the researchers concluded:
“We found no evidence that cryptocurrency assets experiencing a halving event outperform the broader market in the months leading up to and following a reduction in miner rewards… While the narrative is certainly feasible as a logical theory, it is equally possible that we are dealing with an illusion of validity and previous bull runs were the result of nothing more than increasing levels of speculation within the asset class.”

Not at all, I'm just not all that serious about it. Dad gave me a couple Grand to play around with Bitcoin, so I'm gonna invest sometime soon and sell after the halving, whether for profit or loss. That's all I'm here for. I'm not gonna spend all my life being obsessed with Bitcoin.

What could go wrong if I store all my BTC there? What are the possibilities? Is it possible for it to just disappear?

True, there is always risk. I was just wondering how certain people are that prices will skyrocket. Anyway I've decided to make a big investment soon, still waiting for lower prices but if it hits 9k I'll go all in before I can't no more.

noob here. does halving mean that 100% definitely the price will be much higher than it is now?
is it literally impossible for the price to be as low as it is now right after the halving?
