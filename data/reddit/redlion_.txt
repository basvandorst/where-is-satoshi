My post was actually immediately automatically banned. It was brought back and I discussed it with the moderators.

Of course the transactional throughput is finite. Saying we shouldn't do anything to alleviate the current, practical issues that users are facing because it may not be sufficient to accomodate theoretical future demand is like saying we shouldn't fix climate change because of the projected heat death of the universe.
I have seen no evidence (not even no compelling evidence - none at all), that increasing the blocksize limit to, say, 2MB would cause nodes that can currently handle 1MB blocks to shut down.


I assume you're talking about segregated witness. Sure, I support segregated witness - let's roll it out. But that is absolutely no reason to retain the current blocksize limit. I fail to see why you're conflating the two, making it an either/or. There is no technical or rational basis for that.


It seems you don't *use* Bitcoin that much right now. We're not talking about Paypal 2.0, we're talking about regular transactions going through, smoothly and consistently within a reasonable period; and the changes needed to accomplish that.

And your implication is? Most people interested in Bitcoin early on were privacy/anonymity focused. Also I rarely post here.
It would be more productive for you to respond to my comments than my flair.

I posted my support for segwit [here]( [here]( and [here]( within this very thread. I assume you didn't read it.

It would solve the current transaction congestion. Which is important to people who actually use Bitcoin to.. transact.


**I'm sorry. Your argument is that we shouldn't improve the Bitcoin network, because the current poor state of transaction processing gives a private company greater incentive to rush their payment network through? That is just bizarre.**


Sure. Bring on segwit. I'm not against it. I don't see that you've made a compelling case that a blocksize increase isn't an obvious positive.

That is a logical fallacy. Let us consider the operating costs for node operators.
1. internet bandwidth
2. CPU time
3. electricity
4. storage space
So let's examine those.
1. [Here]( is an example of the monthly bandwidth costs of running a full node. If users are on a plan capable of handing those costs, then they are almost certainly not being charged per MB, but have either uncapped or a limited quota, which this is unlikely to exceed. Changing from 1MB -&gt; 2MB would have no significant practical effects for the majority of broadband/UFB users.
2. No significant change. 
3. No significant change.
4. [The current cost of storage space is $0.02/GB.]( At the current size of the blockchain, this would increase the cost of storage used by about 1 dollar.
Presumably the node operators would support this change because they desire Bitcoin to be a functional network, and their transactions to be confirmed within a reasonable timeframe at a reasonable fee.

I read your comment. Not once did you give a reason against increasing the blocksize.
You basically just said people shouldn't be able to use bitcoin to buy things. (A cornerstone of money).

It's an improvement, not a solution. No one is claiming that it will magically fix all bitcoin scaling issues, it's an incremental addition that will alleviate significant problems.


I have no problem with blockstream developing their payment network. My issue is with the claim that we shouldn't improve bitcoin's capacity, because the current deficit encourages them to work faster? That is truly bizarre.


Given the consensus required, each hardfork will doubtless be debated on its own merits. Why don't we worry about this one first.

There is plenty of opposition to raising the blocksize limit right here in this thread. None of it has anything to do with miners.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:35:38


Good for you. I think you'll find that, in many use cases, 24 hours is not an acceptable timeframe for a payment to be confirmed.

Thanks for your comment. As an outsider to the debate, this seems like a reasonable step. Implementing segwit and raising the block size aren't mutually exclusive - arguably complementary, since it could be done in a single HF (segwit looks unlikely to cleanly activate under current conditions).
