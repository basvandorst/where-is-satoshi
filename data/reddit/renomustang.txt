Ever see Dark Knight?  Alfred tells Batman/ Bruce a story about a thief who would steal emeralds and then give them away... he didnt care about the money, Some people just want to watch the world burn...
Ross didn't seem to care about the money, but the advancement of his ideals of an economy free of government... maybe he just wanted to build a better world.

You have to remember that with 3-d printing that at some point anything will be possible to print with the right material. It will be a software loaded program to dedicated hardware that prints what you want. Even food grade material can be used in these printers. Think about it. It wont be the juicy burger that you want, but hey... who wants Oreos?  :D

Actually the technology on 3-d printing is becoming more and more advanced as evidenced by this article .. I'm not saying what OP can do is viable atm , but it certainly is becoming into the realm of things we as a human race can achieve.
Very soon, they will have home medical testing that yes, probably will be able to diagnose a myriad of conditions, not necessarily all of them, as evidenced by this article   
I believe the OP has a valid point and is solid in his reasoning, and probably might make a wise investment.
