We're a global exchange based out of Canada. Like Gox is based out of Japan, and Bitstamp is based out of Slovenia. The bonus for Canadians is that funding and withdrawing from your account is super fast and easy.

Right now, yes. Moving forward, it will affect all Bitcoin businesses that bank with BMO.

Jackson from Cointrader here. We are not operating, or running these terminals. Bitcoin Romania and ZebraPay simply used our API to connect them. We do not control the fee at all.

We went with a USD order book because we want this to be a global exchange, with global exchange liquidity, much like Mt.Gox or Bitstamp. The bonus for Canadians is that it is much easier to fund and withdraw from your account on CoinTrader.net than it is on Gox or Stamp. Also we are able to do foreign exchange at close to spot rate -- not bank rate, which is much higher -- and we will never charge our customers any extra fees: we only charge exactly what the bank charges us.

The ATMs will execute market buy and sell orders, which will add liquidity, so people posting limit orders will have them filled quicker. Our Vancouver ATM is doing about 30 BTC a day, and we've got 4 more coming. We're also working on a merchant payment app that will be tied into the exchange as well. :)

Yet. We had a close relationship with our branch there and they said after Flaherty's budget speech the high-ups at BMO HQ had a meeting and made the decision. The letters are in the mail. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:36:43
Yup in person deposits are possible, and we'll even do in person withdrawals!
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:58:23
Awesome, please pm me the list once you've completed it!
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:52:06
MSB doesn't matter. Unfortunately, they've made the decision at head office and they're in the process of closing any account that deals with Bitcoin. So if you're dealing with BMO, don't wait for it -- go out and get an account with another bank. Best of luck to everyone!

The Bitcoin scene here is incredible!

Did VOS ding you for that transfer, or the bank? We do not charge our customers any fees beyond what the bank charges us for deposits, withdrawals, and FX, meaning we do not profit off of bank fees whatsoever.

We'll verify you at  And if you send in your pre-authorized debit form (PAD), we can easily credit and debit your bank account. Right now credits and debits have been going through very fast. If you get a request in before tomorrow morning it will likely be in your account by the afternoon.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:04:48
We worked with BMO closely for almost a year developing that process, and setting their standard for KYC and AML. You may get through at your specific branch, but as soon as their AML department finds out you're a Bitcoin business they will give you 30 days notice and close your account. I suggest finding a smaller local bank or credit union to bank you. Best of luck to you!
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:33:40
The PAD (Pre-Authorized Debit) form is only for if you want to have us credit and debit your bank account. If you don't want to authorize PADs you can fund your account via bank draft at any BMO branch (super easy), or if you're in Vancouver you can fund it in person at one of our physical locations. We'll also be opening more physical locations across Canada in the coming months which you''ll be able to fund your account at too.

 unaffected :D

Apologies for the lack of deposit information, we're updating the site everyday. There are no deposit fees - we do not profit from banking fees whatsoever - the only fees you pay are the ones that your bank might charge you.

Jackson Warren, Cheyne Mackie, Mitchell Demeter, and Paul Szczesny. We're the same management team as Bitcoiniacs - The Bitcoin Store. The corporation is Cointrader Exchange Inc.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:29:35
Coming soon... 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:40:10
Interesting. Well we won't charge you to receive a wire. You'll just have to pay your bank the $30 wire fee, but if you're in Canada it's much easier to deposit a bank draft (most banks charge $7 for this) at your nearest BMO, or sign up for our pre-authorized debit (PAD) option. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:05:39
We are Bitcoiniacs - The Bitcoin Store, the guys that opened the first physical bitcoin exchange and then installed the world's first Bitcoin ATM -- cointrader.net is our online exchange. We worked with BMO for over a year developing the business model for Bitcoin businesses that bank with them.
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:17:35
We added a CAD order book earlier today. :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:03:04
Hey guys, Jackson from Cointrader here. I want to let you know that we're averaging less than 12 hours to get verified, and that we have the cheapest Interac Online deposits in Canada -- $2 per deposit up to a maximum of $5000 per day. Compare that will Cavirtex's $25 per deposit up to a maximum of $1000 per day and the other guys who are charging 1.5% with a minimum fee of $5. You can also link your bank account with Vogogo to deposit and withdraw -- withdrawals are just $5 up to $9000 per day. Too see our complete list of funding options check out 
Onward and upward!

I've been fighting for a CAD book internally for quite awhile now, and I couldn't be happier that we've finally added it. Now we just need to fill it up! :) 
We were holding off on our MSB, but now that we're doing CAD, USD, and BTC, we're going to get it set up along with a forex license so users can exchange CAD/USD right on the exchange. I expect that whole process to take a couple of months though.

Hi bitterwife, Jackson from Bitcoiniacs here. I sincerely apologize for the delay and the confusion at the ATM. Most transactions through the ATM will process within minutes, but very rarely, because of the way that Bitstamp processes withdrawals, it can take up to a few hours. This is very frustrating for us, so we're looking for a new exchange that processes withdrawals immediately and has enough liquidity to handle the ATM. Right now there is no need for you to wait at coffee shop, just keep your transaction receipt, and if there are any problems email me directly at contact
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:14:16
Hello again bitterwife. Bitstamp has FINALLY processed all of the withdrawals. It's a shame that this had to happen to you, or anyone. We've taken it very seriously, and are now working on a solution so that this never happens again. If you send me your bitcoin address to contact I will happily send over some bitcoin as compensation for your trouble.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:00:13
That's a great idea, and we've thought of it. Unfortunately we don't manage the ATM software - Robocoin does - so they need to code that feature for us.
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:16:05
Hi bitterwife. Again, so sorry about the delay and the confusion today, and I apologize for my employee's ineffective explanation of the situation. As of right now Bitstamp is still is not processing withdrawals. We've had phone calls and emails from many different people today in the same situation as you, but unfortunately it is out of our hands at this point. When this has happened in the past I've seen it take up to 10 hours for withdrawals to process. Bitstamp states on their website that it may take up to 24 hours. Rest assured though that they will process the withdrawal, and that this is not at all a normal occurrence.
About the mining fee: the mining fee has nothing to do with what is happening right now. The problem is in the way that Bitstamp processes their withdrawals. There is nothing that you could have done, or that we could have done to prevent this. The only solution (as another poster suggested) is to hold a bitcoin float in the ATM and pay out that way, but Robocoin (the ATM manufacture and software provider) has not coded that in as a feature.
