@_date: 2016-04-12 21:21:37
if you wanted to buy 10 BTCs for example 
and the first person (lowest price) say  had 5 on offer with a second person offering 8  it would buy the first 5 then 'eat' another 5 from the second person until your order (of 10) was met.
The second person is now at the top of the sell order, with 3 remaining on offer to the next buyer.
so yes it usually is multiple people depending on the buy order.

Upon transfer of banknotes or coins to the bank, the latter normally acquires ownership thereof, and the depositor acquires personal rights against the bank. Although the depositor may also be regarded as the owner of such a claim, the object of such ownership is incorporeal and is not related to the banknotes or coins transferred to the bank.

Not true, as part of my research I looked into how people could try and achieve this false style of writing, believe it or not it's very hard to mimic/clone someone elses traits, there have even been court cases where for example a husband killed his partner/wife then using her love notes tried to re-create a suicide note (as if it was written from her) even though he copied the handwriting and other possible qualities it was determined that it was he who wrote the suicide letter.
While it is difficult it is not impossible. Humans subconsciously have unqiue fingerprints and writing techniques.

yes your data like your account information, but the financial data will likely supersede this, and I am sure while the "front-end" data can be removed I am sure their back-end systems will still have a way to link it back to you.

I've used QCX ever since Vault of Satoshii was closed, 
My thoughts: 
* Troubled CEO fled India to make give whole thing some credibility/excuse to "disappear" (Orphanages)
* So far no real proof he is dead (you can get a Death Cert in India for $500)
* India is one of the best places in the world to disappear
* Wife (Jen) may or may not be his love of his life (and just a friend who was promised $$ if she goes along and keeps her mouth shut. 
* CEO states they use multi-sig but then claims everything is on a single encrypted laptop? 
* Has time to buy a plane/house and dog "insurance" doesn't have time to entrust senior staff/directors with Coin info/encryption details
* Married in Oct, Will in Nov, "Dead" in Dec
* Nov 300BTC sell at 15-20% premium (vol might not sound much but it was huge for QCX) - either CEO or another insider knew something wasn't right.
* Details from LTC shows wallets very much active (now to see the BTC cold wallet addresses).
* Fuck all communications from Company (zero transparency)

There was once was a man, all high and mighty who wanted to use his power, wit and will, to enforce the evil world of bitcoin to the regulation standards used by the immaculate Banking industry and morals they uphold today. 
So he created the BitLicense, a magnificent feat of bureaucracy, fluff and much much cost.
He then decided it was law and used his power and mite to enforce it upon the town of New York to better serve the people, to protect them, to give them the freedom to operate under his regime.
He then descended from his position of god like status to create his own company to preach and flaunt wares in order to be complaint to his newly created laws and standards needed on the little people of new york, but the villagers rebelled and left in droves to setup shop, where was no fuckface Lawsky.

Basically its a piece of paper saying you own X-amount so a Gold ETF for example says "I am the bearer of X-amount of Gold" it basically is a way of holding/trading (in this case gold) without the actual need to physically hold the underlying asset (gold) so you trade the piece of paper. Bitcoin ETF cwould be good for people who don't care about the tech, or how to store it or move it, they just pay for the ETF paper that says you own X-amount of Bitcoin.

I'm from London and worked for Hedge Funds and Stockbrokers. 
London doesn't have lax gambling laws, they are just less stringent than the US, compliance governance and security is still high in the UK, but even less regulated on places like Jersey, IoM (where for example PokerStars is located). 
The SEC is, and has a lot more power and authority than the FSA (which is soon to be abolished).
I hope BTC companies move to and operate out of the UK, as the US seem to be dragging their heels and make all the hoops to jump through a painful process.

yes it is dangerous is you have default ones like 22/23 (SSH &amp; Telnet) open and set as defaults, because it allows someone come in, so you should change common ports, but things like bitcoins 8333 its fine.

you need to have multiple accounts on exchanges, and need to be quick as if the markets turn then you can lose any profit (so most who do this do it via API's and scripts as opposed to logging in and trading (too slow).

it doesn't depend on someone, that is the point Andreas was making.
However people assume that because the 'identity' is revealed they have authority in the thing they helped created.  
End of the day it doesn't matter who or what, individual or group helped create Bitcoin it stands by its mathematical principals.

you basically buy a fraction of a bitcoin without the need to physically hold/store it, the Trust does all this themselves and gives you a certificate of ownership. It allows people to buy into bitcoins for those who do not care about the tech etc etc. People who use companies like Fidelity, use a broker to buy common shares, and those sensible distribute their risk over various commodities, this is now another item on the shelf for people to buy.

"the Bitlicense would have required to actually prevent it from happening in the first place." you really think? a hack is a hack, just thing of all the banking industries who have layers upon layers of bureaucracy and "licenses" and yet they still leak like a tap.    
do you not think companies like Target are not compliant? they sure as fuck are with PCI/SOX etc, and *they* still got hacked.  
I bet the BitLicense wouldn't have any competencies around IT security, it's mearly a formality from a financial governance perspective, and besides being "compliant" means very little sometimes (one line or a check box on some document), some are just guidelines and not actual requirements.

Because they do not understand the tech and/or the fundamentals behind it, and ultimately the media is owned by big corps who are threatened (and profits hit) with such technology as BTC.

Hey Miston....fuck off. This isn't a personal buy &amp; sell sub.

I hope he lost his job as an 'IT administrator' (I too work in IT) if he threw a HDD out without wiping it first (I don't care it's his personal one) then shame on him, I hope he doesn't do this in his day job.
-he deserves nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:50:18
yep, I worked with a lot of young guys fresh out of University with Maths, Physics (like myself) Economics degrees (from Oxford, Cambridge, LSE) becoming stockbrokers, most lasted less than 12months (99% of them had a chip on their shoulder), I saw them come and go. There were few I would say who were actually good, and of 100 traders 3 were about over the age of 40. Needless to say after I left many got the boot and found it hard to get proper jobs. Hedge Fund managers on the other hand have the time to do due diligence and research so less risk.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:52:38
million meh, I have friends who Trade several billion on a daily basis (no joke) :P
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:31:58
I am in IT, this guy should be hung, drawn &amp; quartered for being an "IT Professional" for not wiping his HDD before throwing it out, hope he doesn't do this at work.
I'm glad he's got jackshit.

@_date: 2013-12-27 19:41:56
well some are, some do not have a clue about Market Making or Brokering, some of them I would not trust with my money that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:45:55

@_date: 2013-12-28 00:43:44
but for tools like OP it holds true.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:44:22
why are you sorry for him? it's a life lesson, he knew the risks.

Oh I used to work for 2 large Hedge funds, and a stockbrokers in the city of London, so yea why would I be lying?
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:30:28
I would use Wuala over DropBox it does end-to-end encryption, they don't even have access to it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:16:43
Hedge Funds are jumping onboard, I know I used to work for them.
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:06:03

@_date: 2013-12-27 17:49:49
"professional trader" ha I used to work at stock brokers and hedge funds, and I can tell you there is no such thing as professional, ANY idiot can play the markets. Most talk shit think they *are* the shit but in reality a monkey is just as good.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:37:03
wonder if there is a way to ban or least block people with 0day accounts to prevent them from posting...
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:59:09

I'm not trying to be a debbie-downer, but money does funny things to people, she says that now but things can and do change, all the best, but "investing" it all is a mistake in my opinion.

@_date: 2013-12-12 17:12:29
can we stop spamming this shit.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:38:05
don't invest anymore than you are prepared to lose, it's life.
Perhaps you shouldn't invest anymore? and play it safe instead of trying to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:45:55
